Rarely has the " secret war " been waged so publicly . First the government of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher announced the defection of London KGB Station Chief Oleg Gordievsky and demanded the departure of 25 alleged Soviet agents . Two days later Moscow ordered an equal number of British subjects out of the country . Early last week London upped the ante by expelling six more Soviets . Within 48 hours , Moscow sent half a dozen Britons packing . At that point , London called it quits after a diplomatic test of nerves that had lasted more than a week and resulted in the expulsion of 31 diplomats , journalists and commercial employees from each capital . <P> Meanwhile , West German officials announced that a husband-and-wife team of suspected spies had fled to East Germany . The pair were identified as Herbert Willner , 59 , a defense expert influential within the Free Democratic Party , and his wife Herta-Astrid , 46 , a secretary in the office of West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl . Their defection came four weeks after Hans Joachim Tiedge , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to East Germany , along with three other suspected Communist agents . The Willner case prompted renewed demands for the resignation of Interior Minister Friedrich Zimmermann , who oversees Bonn 's domestic intelligence agency . <P> The tension between London and Moscow began on Sept. 12 . Two days later Soviet Foreign Ministry Official Vladimir Suslov angrily denounced the initial British expulsion order as a " hostile and malicious " action designed to " poison Anglo-Soviet relations . " Suslov handed British Ambassador Sir Bryan Cartledge a list of Britons slated to be expelled . <P> The harshness of the first Soviet retaliation came as a surprise to British officials , who had expected only token reprisals . Last week in London , the Foreign Office summoned Soviet Charge d'Affaires Lev Parshin , denounced the expulsions as " an unwarranted victimization of innocent people " and demanded the departure of six more Soviets . After Moscow matched the new expulsions man for man , Thatcher said that Britain would make " no further response . " The British expulsions , she asserted , had " eliminated the core of the subversives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Union in a pretty poor light . They were caught red-handed and are now red-faced . " <P> Moscow 's reaction to the British expulsions was interpreted as a blunt message to the West from Soviet Leader Mikhail Gorbachev two months before his November summit with President Ronald Reagan . " He may want to look like a man you can do business with , " said a Western diplomat in Moscow . " But he also does n't want to look like a weakling . " With grudging admiration for the Soviet leader 's tactics , a British official declared , " The way the Russians have played tit for tat demonstrates Gorbachev 's skill in making the best of a bad job .
