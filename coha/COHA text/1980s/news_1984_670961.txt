Several researchers have found , moreover , that repeated viewings of films such as " Friday the 13th " and " The Texas Chainsaw Massacre " instill attitudes in the minds of the viewers that are similar to those found in rapists . For instance , viewers , including women , become more callous in the face of the films ' portrayals of violence toward women and more likely to believe that a woman who was raped wanted to be. // Other data show that such scenes have proliferated in commercial films in the last two years . A survey found that one in eight movies commercially released in 1983 depicted violent acts against women , a sharp increase from 1982 when the rate was one movie in 20. // These results were announced here over the weekend in a symposium on the effects of violent pornography at the meeting of the American Psychological Association . The new findings are prompting psychologists to broaden their definition of pornography to include depictions of violence against women that have little or no overt sexual content. // In a series of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women , Dr. Neil Malamuth , a psychologist at the University of California at Los Angeles , told the symposium that he found that 30 percent of the men studied were aroused by nonsexual violence . Psychologists had previously thought that this pattern was unique to men who actually raped women. // Some of the research describing the specific effects of repeated viewings of such films was done by Edward Donnerstein , a psychologist at the University of Wisconsin . The study assessed the psychological effects on men of watching over a period of several days five " slasher " movies , which feature graphic scenes of bloody violence mainly to young women . The men were given psychological tests before and after seeing the series of films. // After seeing the films , according to data described at the symposium , the men found the movies to be progressively less upsetting , more enjoyable and less debasing to women . When asked to sit in as the mock jury of a rape case the men more often judged the rape victim to be at fault for what had happened , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raped 20 women is the extreme of where those attitudes point , " said Dr. Gene G. Abel , a psychiatrist at Emory University , in an interview. // Women who viewed the same movies had a somewhat parallel reaction . They became emotionally desensitized , finding the movies progressively less upsetting . They also were more likely to judge a rape victim to be at fault. // " Straightforward pornography , movies like ' Debby Does Dallas , ' don ' t seem to have these effects on people ' s attitudes toward women , " Dr. Donnerstein said in an interview. // <> <> Similarity to Known Rapists // A small group of men in the study of slasher films showed in their initial testing such a strong similarity to the profiles of men willing to commit rape that for ethical reasons they were not allowed to view all five films. // Along with an attitude of callousness toward women and such beliefs as " women want to be raped , " men in this small group also scored higher on tests for traits of hostility and mental turmoil. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of rape , it is psychological factors such as these that distinguish men who rape from those who do not but say they might. // John Briere , a psychologist at the University of Manitoba , has found that attitudes among men that were once thought to signify the thinking of rapists were held in some degree by many men. // Speaking at the symposium on " Sexual Violence in the Media , " Dr. Briere reported that his survey also found rape itself to be far more common than had been thought : 10 percent of college men admitted to having physically forced a woman to have sex against her will. // Those who admitted to rape shared the attitudes held by convicted rapists , said Dr. Briere . These included subscribing to such myths about rape as that women want to be forced to have sex , that rapes do not occur but are instead women ' s lies , and that women enjoy sexual violence. // These men also reported being sexually excited by one or more nonsexual aspects of rape , including the subjugation , degradation or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men were not particularly heavy users of pornographic films or magazines , although they reported reading more pornographic books than other men in the study. // <> <> Myths About Rape // Other research , including a survey of high school students in Los Angeles mentioned by Dr. Malamuth , has found myths about rape , which violent pornography seems to promulgate , to be more widespread than experts had thought. // Close to 50 percent of college men subscribe to such myths , according to data reported by Dr. Malamuth . And in another survey of more than 2 , 000 men , 35 percent said they might rape a woman if they could get away without being caught. // Other studies presented at the symposium reported that men who had watched films that combined sex and violence - even the critically acclaimed " Swept Away , " which was directed by a woman , Lina Wertmuller - became more callous toward women. // The link between aggressive pornography and violence diverges from the findings of the Commission on Obscenity and Pornography , published in the United States in 1970 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violence . But Dr. Malamuth observed that in 1970 pornography with a component of violence was relatively rare. // A study published recently in The Journal of Psychiatry reported a large increase in portrayals of violence toward women on the covers of such commonly available sexually explicit magazines as Hustler. // Some of the new findings have already been used in several cities , including Indianapolis , Los Angeles and Minneapolis , in arguments favoring antipornography ordinances. // <> <> Censorship Not Advocated // Still , the psychologists conducting these studies do not advocate the outright censorship of violent pornography . According to Dr. Malamuth , one reason is that while violent pornography seems to harden men ' s attitudes toward women , it has yet to be shown that it leads them to acts of sexual violence. // Writing in " Pornography and Sexual Aggression " ( Academic Press ) , an anthology to be published next month , Dr. Malamuth notes that there is " ample reason for concern about the effects of aggressively toned pornography . " For one , " the coupling of sex and aggression in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sex and aggression in their lives . That effect , however , seems most likely to occur among children and adolescents who have not yet established strong sexual preferences , Dr. Malamuth said. // Dr. Malamuth ' s research with college students shows that exposure to depictions of violent sex does not seem to increase sexual arousal since by that age sexual patterns tend to be well-established . Dr. Malamuth has found , however , that men who are shown films such as " Swept Away , " which depict women resisting and then enjoying violent sex , become more accepting of the idea that women want to be forced to have sex. // This change in the attitudes men hold toward women , the researchers at the symposium pointed out , may be socially significant . While individual pathology may be one factor that leads a man to rape , experts agree that the overall climate of attitudes toward women is also a factor. // Even though rapists are aroused by the fantasy of violence to women , they do not seem to be among the most frequent users of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worker at a Minnesota treatment center for adolescent sex offenders . He said that most young rapists have had little or no exposure to pornography. // <> <> Many Rapists Were Victims // More than 90 percent , however , were victims of sexual abuse as children . " I don ' t think pornography has that much influence on those who rape , " Mr. Johnson said in an interview . " More important is what ' s happened to them in their past. " // A similar view on the use of pornography by rapists is held by Dr. Abel , a leading authority on rapists . " Men who rape don ' t need pornography to stimulate their violent fantasies about women ; they ' re obsessed by these fantasies , " he said . " Many rapists have been masturbating to the fantasy of violence against women since they were teen-agers . The rapist ' s obsession with rape fantasies is so great that it warps his sense of reality about women. " // Watching violent pornography , in Dr. Abel ' s view , is " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that fantasy in masturbation or intercourse , and only then if it becomes an obsessive fantasy for him . That ups the ante considerably . Even so , there are probably many men with that fantasy who will never be rapists. " // " The most telling effect of scenes of violence toward women may be on our children , who are still forming their sexual outlooks , " Dr. Briere said . " We won ' t know for years exactly what the effects of that exposure will be . But it is unlikely to be very healthy. " //
