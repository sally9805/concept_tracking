The junta tries to make a deal <P> The plea from Argentina 's military rulers was a strange one , and bore signs of more than a little desperation . In a discreet radio and television announcement , the junta that has ruled the country since 1976 urged Argentine civilians to show " greatness of spirit , " " patriotism " and " definitive national unity . " Then the military government itemized a list of 15 topics on which it would like to see concertacin ( understanding ) with local politicians , union leaders and perhaps even the Roman Catholic Church before the government fulfills a promise to return the nation to civilian rule in March 1984 . The list was described as a set of principles to help create " the necessary conditions for a stable democracy . " In fact , it looked as if the nervous junta wanted a blanket amnesty for its actions during the past six years . <P> The list contained among other things a series of restrictions on any future government that might want to investigate the military stewardship . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ culpability in the fate of Argentina 's desaparecidos ( disappeared ones ) . At least 6,000 Argentines and foreign nationals vanished between 1974 and 1979 during the country 's fratricidal struggle against left-wing terrorism . Also included on the proposed list of taboo topics was the military 's humiliating defeat by Britain in last spring 's Falkland Islands war , which resulted in 1,366 Argentine casualties .

The furor was ignited after an Argentine couple discovered the body of their son , Miguel Angel Sosa , in one of the cemetery plots . Subsequent investigations revealed that the corpses were stacked as many as six deep in unmarked graves , and that numerous victims had been killed with a single bullet in the head . Most of the bodies are still unidentified , but there is little doubt as to who they are : desaparecidos.
