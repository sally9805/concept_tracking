Last year , 134 " foreign experts " were scattered across the country ; this September new areas , such as Chengdu in remote Sichuan ( Szechuan ) Province , acquired their first foreign teachers , while large groups , numbering up to 10 at Nanking Teachers College , descended on other institutions. // This was a situation far different from 1978 , during which one or two foreigners , assigned to provincial cities , found themselves to be the only native speakers of English in the entire region. // The deliverate importation of educational specialists to upgrade certain fields , such as management and engineering , through shortterm seminars has been widely reported . Long-term and widespread appointments of these foreign teachers are a different matter . The designation " foreign expert " dates back to the beginning of the People ' s Republic in 1949 . Employed " friends " of the postrevolution government and foreigners married to Chinese women were so labeled . They were , even then , accorded special salaries and privileges , because their life styles and consequent needs were considered to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not always the case , and not all of them accepted the largess in its entirety. // Today the bulk of these specialists are in the language area. americans , Britons , Canadians , Australians , and New Zealanders are found teaching English under a variety of programs. // Some were hired by the Ministry of Education from direct application or in answer to appeals for teachers . Others were placed by bodies such as the United States-China Friendship Association , and still others by universities seeking to establish exchange programs. // The result is a variety of contracts , backgrounds , training , screening , selection procedures , and , for students , supervision . The Foreign Language Institute and other educational centers in Peking have absorbed most of these teachers . Provincial universities were supplied more recently. // The numbers of foreign students in China has expanded slowly ; some share in the teaching of English while working on their Chinese . This fall , Chengdu not only received its first " foreign experts " but two undergraduates from the University of Virginia . The arranagements were made by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Similarly , an international relations major from the University of Denver is teaching English in Peking , while eight recent Ohio State graduates are in Wuhan for six months of teaching . The University of Pittsburgh has representatives in Shanghai , and four Yale graduates are in Changsha ( Hunan ) and at the University of Wuhan. // Carefully screened , selected , and trained , even in the teaching of English as a second ( i. e. , foreign ) language , the latter are also supervised and partly financed by the Yale-in-China Association , a modified form of the pre- 1949 activities of Yale University on the mainland. // English is not the only language being upgraded with the help of native speakers . German and Japanese " experts " are in evidence . Russian is taught , but with no Soviet help apparent . Spanish is the only major language not readily encountered. // The French government , long a committed sponsor of French-language and cultural centers in the non-Western world , is establishing a center at the University of Wuhan , in the heart of the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he visited France . Twelve teachers , paid from Paris , and a new language lab were arranged for . French then became the only part of the Modern Language Department to merit and administrative structure of its own . It not only became a splinter department , but may get its own building. // " Foreign teachers , " a designation preferred over " experts " by the participants , are well treated in China . Qualified language instructors receive from 600 to 700 yuan monthly ( about $411 to $480 ) , the base for Level 3 experts . The top in the scale would be 1 , 300 yuan ( $890 ) . From $30 to 50 percent of the salary can be repatriated depending upon marital status. // Level 2 salaries , ranging from 345 ( $236 ) to 599 yuan ( $410 ) , are for the less experienced . Even the modest 200 yuan ( $137 ) a month paid to students , recent graduates , and teaching wives of " experts " is phenomenal by Chinese standards , particularly as lodging , essential local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are provided as well. // " Experts , " by government decree , are not charged tourist prices ; even so they always pay about double the Chinese cost for a bowl of rice or noodles . The government regulation is enforced irregularly , because some restaurants and hotels in provincial areas have not heard about it . As of July , these teachers were to pay 9 yuan ( $6. 15 ) for a room and the same for board at a hotel . The tourist price is about double this. // Chinese instructors , at the bottom of the faculty hierarchy , receive only 48 yuan ( $39 ) a month , but their expenses are substantially lower . They live and eat in teachers ' dormitories . If married , their spouses usually bring in a similar sum from their own employment . Although Chinese living conditions remain austere , they are decidely better than before the Revolution for some 80 percent of the population , and they are improving. // The normal teaching load for foreigners is about 18 hours a week . This is accomplished usually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Like professors everywhere , both are busy on weekends grading papers. // As long as an " expert " fulfills his contract , his round-trip transportation is provided . Visiting specialists , however , lecturing on short- term programs , must usually pay their own or gain outside funding. // The lodging provided for " experts " is a major benefit . The Friendship Hotel in Peking , a huge hostelry for 3 , 000 guests , includes buildings for longer-term residents . These have two or three heated rooms with baths and cooking facilities . Many universities are nearby. // This year saw the construction of guesthouses for foreigners at several major provincial institutions . A Hong Kong visitor reports that the one at the University of Wuhan is among the nicest . It is on university land overlooking East Lake , a regional beauty spot , and has 20 steam-heated units , 12 with two rooms , bath , and kitchenette for singles , and 8 with extra room for families or couples . In a land where four or five individuals , spanning three generations , frequently live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bathhouse facilities , the " ex // A central recreation area and a dining room , along with quarters for the workers , complete the layout . Residents wishing to cook in whole or in part can do so in their minuscule 3-by-3-foot kitchens . One- and two- burner propane stoves and countertop-level refrigerators are provided in the living room . Food and beverages can be bought at cost from the kitchen , which also permits use of its oven for baking cakes or other goodies . Food served in the dining hall is 90 percent Chinese and costs $2. 75 a day per person. // Before this guesthouse was completed , American teachers lived in faculty housing with toilet facilities but without heat or hot water . Unlike their Chinese colleagues , they were provided with a stove to take the edge off of the freezing temperatures , but they bathed in the local bathhouse. // The comfort of their guests , rather than any attempt at isolation , appears to motivate the ghettoizing of the " experts . " Chinese of all levels seem genuinely to expect that foreigners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // Food is the only necessity that visiting teachers pay for in China . Whereas a professional-level Chinese family of four claims to eat well on 100 yuan ( $69 ) a month , a frugal Americal couple paid about twice that at a dining room for foreigners . Another couple paid 240 yuan ( $164 ) for Chinese food cooked for them at a university , while a single person , eating two-thirds Western food ( which means more meat and is therefore more expensive ) , paid 180 yuan ( $123 ) a month . The prices cited for meals are not those of the hotels usually visited by American tourists. // Many run their bills up further with the purchase of orange soda ( 7 cents at cost , 15 cents in a foreign restaurant ) . Chinese rely upon soup for liquid , with meals , or tea between meal . Cola is available only for foreigners . It is sold solely at the Friendship Stores or at bars in tourist hotels and by special currency cerificates obtained when tourists exchange money .

Exemption from customs duties on food and clothing packages , which run between 100 and 150 percent , is a further benefit . Without this , the mailing of out-of-season clothing would be impossible. // Because the Chinese are generally of a slighter build than Westerners , this ability to buy abroad is a blessing for long-term reisidents whose jeans are wearing thin . Nothing thin has any appeal in most of China in the winter , as classrooms , as well as most homes , have no heat . A Mongolian girl described the students as " round balls in winter , " a new expression for the multilayered look to which even the " foreign experts " must subscribe. // //
