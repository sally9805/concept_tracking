The show of paintings by the English artist Leon Kossoff , which opened last ( week at the Robert Miller Gallery in New York City , ought to provoke some reflection . Kossoff , 61 , is hardly known in America . He is one of the two English tortoises ( the other being Frank Auerbach ) who are crossing the finish line just when most of the short-winded art hyped in the 1980s has gone dead on its feet . Both are , so to speak , redemptive artists , sustaining and enlarging a tradition of the expressive human figure that seems largely to have been colonized by ham-fisted ephemerids . When neoexpressionism arrived in the early ' 80s , it was as though an army of Bronze Age hectors had assembled , chanting hoarsely of sex , anxiety , death and egotism , leaving long tracks of slimy paint and broken crockery behind them in their progress toward the art centers of the world . The dull percussion of beaten chests went on for around five years . Then a dying fall . And who lasted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were expected to . In Germany , Anselm Kiefer ; in America , Susan Rothenberg ; and in England , Auerbach and Kossoff . <P> The son of a Jewish baker , Kossoff grew up in the East End of London . After being discharged from the army at the end of World War II , he studied under David Bomberg  --  once a prodigy of the vorticist movement but by 1947 a forgotten man , a failure , whose stature as a painter is only now being recognized . Bomberg gave Kossoff two things : first , a grounding in the relations between modernism and the past , based on unrelenting drawing from life , which has practically been wiped out of art training in the past 20 years ; and second , patience , a sense of endurance . <P> As a result , Kossoff 's work went naturally against the grain . A figurative painter when abstract art was the rage , he sinned by embracing premature neoexpressionism back in the ' 50s and ' 60s . When painting was required to be thin , linear and efflorescent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around him and the memories within . His scenes of public baths , markets and Underground entrances are packed with small figures , stuck in their social matrix as though in jam ( especially given Kossoff 's dense pigment )  --  a pictorial equivalent , as it were , of the double meaning of the Hebrew word olam , which means world but also crowd . A painting like A Street in Willesden , 1985 , reminds one of how pointless the stereotypes about English art have become . It is not anecdotal , witty , light or conversational . Rather , the opposite . In Kossoff , an obdurate grandeur of intention is coupled with a deep sense of cultural continuity . What other living painter can embed groups of figures in deep space with such conviction ? <P> Kossoff is , above all , a painter obsessed with oily stuff . His paint is thick without being rhetorical . The surface develops by addition , sometimes over months , and contains an extraordinary range of nuances both in color and in texture : tremulous depths of pinkish-gray held within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Venetian red and salmon pink in the body of a nude , rescued from mere allusiveness by the vehement drawing of shadow that gives Kossoff 's work its tonal framework . Its solidity is relieved , almost involuntarily , by the whipping of skeins of pigment fallen directly from the brush , which work as a form of counterdrawing , lifting the thick surfaces from inertia .
