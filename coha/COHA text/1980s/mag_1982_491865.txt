The great John Singer Sargent himself went right to the heart of the matter . A portrait , said he with wry precision , is a " painting with a little something wrong with the mouth . " Ray Kinstler is a genuinely modest man , aware of his talents but humbly grateful for them , and he would be distressed to be called the leading U.S. portrait painter ; yet no other is his superior . His works speak for him . Some of them you see in these pages , and immediately the Kinstler touch is apparent : an impeccable control of color and shape and anatomy and then the almost unreachable secret to it all  --  the divination of the humanity and spirit of the subject . Kinstler 's credits are astounding for a man in his middle years . In all , he has done some 500 commissioned portraits , mostly of subjects in public and private life who have the authority to be demanding in the utmost . In the halls of the mighty hang Kinstler portraits of former president Gerald R.

The commanding officers of the U.S. Navy ; the Marines , the Air Force and West Point have sat still at Ray 's order . So have astronauts Alan Shepard and Scott Carpenter . He has also painted UN Secretaries-General Kurt Waldheim and Dag Hammerskold ; from Hollywood and Broadway , John Wayne , Jimmy Cagney , Alfred Drake , John Barrymore , Dennis King ( and now a portrait in progress adds Katharin Hepburn to the cast ) ; authors Tennessee Williams , Brendan Gill , S.J. Perlman , Russell Lynes , Theodore H. White . The burden of all this falls upon a personality well stocked with the esprit to carry it off with panache . Ray Kinstler is a consummate artist : He works oils , watercolor , acrylic , pastels , charcoal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stories . . On the other hand , I knew that the job would n't be easy . After all , Wayne 's face was known to millions , and my interpretation would surely invite critical comment . How was I to paint a 50-year career on one canvas ? " Mohammet went to the mountain this time  --  Kinstler was eager to meet Duke on his own turf out West . At Wayne 's Newport Beach , California , home , when the two met at last , the artist immediately measured his man . " I was impressed ... with his size  --  the larger-than-life feeling that he projected . He was a man who dwarfed others in his presence , even those who were physically larger than he was . Although he 'd been ill recently , he was a figure of granite , a man of sculptural proportions . And the effect was more than visual . He 'd been quoted as saying that he did n't act  --  he reacted . He projected amazing charisma . He conveyed it vocally and in his way of moving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two men hit it off and spent some time together over meals and drinks and good talk . Kinstler made color notes and a few pencil drawings . " I studied photos and movie stills that covered his half-century on the screen . As I watched him , I made notes of characteristic poses , movements and expressions .... From the time I learned of the commission , " Ray now reminisces with his eyes sparkling at the memory of being with the actor , " I was convinced Wayne should be portrayed outdoors . With this in mind . I asked him if he 'd let me take photos on his patio for future reference . As he stood there , the harsh California sun was n't kind to Wayne 's worn and salty features . Somehow , he did n't look particularly ' western ' as he stood outside in his brown polo shirt , suntans and sneakers . I asked him if he might have a chapeau . He produced a battered , much-traveled hat that dated back to his early John Ford movies . As soon as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years old . The years seemed to disappear , and I saw that legendary image , the illusion of a man half his age. -I felt that I was sitting in a movie theater once again , watching the ultimate western hero once again . I noted his belt buckle : a memento from Red River . " At this point , Duke had a few suggestions . Ray was shooting away in 35mm color from all angles . " At one point Wayne squatted and looked up at me . ' Try this angle , Ray , ' he suggested . Instinctively , I started to squat on his level . ' No , ' he said , ' shoot as if you 're standing . ' With his long experience and knowledge of his own face , he knew that I 'd catch him looking directly at me . When he stood , he was so tall that my camera was looking up under his chin . " Armed with his on-location sketches , oil studies , notes and rolls of film , Ray sped back to his studio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on . After all , his method was to complete his research for the physical image and then enter a phase of " thinking " his way into the inContinued on page ICIO Kiastier continued from page 63 terpretation of the final portrait . " A portrait is a total picture , not a collection of details . Strange as it may seem , I am never concerned about likeness when I start to paint , except in a general way . I think only about big shapes , about the movement I want to get in a painting . As I talk to the subject in the first meeting , I watch for characteristics : how he sits in a chair ; whether he appears to be a nervous man , vigorous or easygoing . " Kinstler estimates that he requires four three-hour sittings with a subject and approximately 80 additional hours to complete a portrait . But not always . " Every painting represents a struggle . When someone asked me how long it took me to paint Governor John Connally , I replied : ' Two years and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facetious . I made countless sketches and color studies . Dissatisfied , I put the project aside to start afresh . After struggling with the concept for two years , I filially worked out what I wanted to do , and then I painted the portrait in two days . " There was plenty of thinking over the Wayne portrait , too . Unhappily , Duke had been hospitalized and was unavailable for further work on the portrait . But they corresponded , and Wayne 's illness never kept him from being himself . He wrote to Ray on May 1 , 1978 , commenting on a sketch showing him on horseback : " Dear Ray : " I love the pen sketch .. . except that I do n't sit like the handle on a coffee cup . Straighten up that back , will you ? " Your admirer and critic who does n't know what he 's talking about . " Sincerely , Duke . " Ray works hard , cutting his way through the underbrush of impressions . Duke worked along with him : " Only singing cowboys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , over the eyes . " Kinstler exhibits no fewer than six oil paintings of Wayne on canvas , a progression in which he gradually captures first the characteristic outlines of the Wayne head , then tightens up on details as he digs in deeperinto the likeness . Ultimately , he decides on a three-quarter length figure in a characteristic pose " with his hands on his hips and his crooked smile . .. The man himself was so imposing that I knew I wanted nothing in the background . All I wanted was a feeling of sky and desert .. .. I tried to keep my brushwork as loose and casual as possible to reflect the actor 's rugged , relaxed style . " It took all of a year , but in the end , Ray had his reward . Wayne was home again , and Ray flew out with the completed picture . " The portrait was ' unveiled ' for Duke as 1 watched with Dean Krakel and Rich Munro from the National Cowboy Hall of Fame and Wayne 's friend Bob Norris . Duke had . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how well he looked . He gestured at the portrait : ' I 'd rather look like him . I like that fellow  --  he 's ready ! ' " Multiply the John Wayne episode by 500 Kinstler portraits of record , add perhaps scores of unofficial works he has done for his own purposes , then sprinkle with a smattering of out-and-out failures which I did n't ask Ray about , but which are there just the same . A look back brings them to mind : " It 's important to keep plugging away , and it 's also important to keep some perspective about both success and rejection . And a sense of humor helps , too . The main thing is to keep working , experiencing , growing . You 've got to train your eye and develop your emotions to work together . We 're all students . There 's no end to learning . As John Sloan said : ' I 'm still a student , chewing on a bone . ' "             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
