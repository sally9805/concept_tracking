For decades , the Democrats won elections by running against Herbert Hoover . Now , incredibly , they are getting ready to run against Franklin D. Roosevelt and all his works . The astonishing thing is that they have chosen to engage in such a self-destructive exercise just when they have in the White House a President who reveres Hoover 's predecessor , Calvin Coolidge ( which Hoover did not ) . Discount the labels if you will , but it 's the rare Democrat who today calls himself " liberal . " The Democrats say they are struggling for " the middle ground , " an area supposed to be occupied by an electoral majority . At least that 's where the Reaganites like to think they are when they call their politics " conservative . " The truth is that they are radical reactionaries , turning over the business of America to monstrously swollen corporations with less sense than ever of acting in the public good . Democratic conclaves are full of talk about rethinking policies , updating programs , winnowing the chaff from the past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Republicans ' benighted initiatives of abandonment lack point and resonance . The leadership , if it can be called that , ca n't bring itself to dismiss Jimmy Carter as a disaster and erase his memory . They react to Reagan 's giant mistakes routinely , which is not enough . The Democratic National Strategy Council 's meeting in mid-October was long on rhetoric and tactics , short on passion and a sense of purpose . The Democrats count on inheriting the eventual Reagan mess and confine themselves to the calculating maneuvers of potential legatees . This is safe politics but dangerous for the country . America 's oldest political party seems set to self-destruct , leaving us with no powerful instrument to use against the foreign adventures and domestic cruelties of the Reagan Administration . TATDE THE WEAPONS ELITE THE IRON TETA M IJ1 , E GORDON ADAMS During the next five years , the Reagan Administration proposes to spend $1.5 trillion on defense  --  or more than $6,500 for every American citizen . Even if the cuts now being considered in Congress are made , military spending authority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? $1,000 per person . This huge buildup , which is even larger than what took place during the Vietnam War , will restock and modernize the entire American arsenal from strategic missiles to conventional forces . A new generation of weapons will be introduced : MX missiles with ten warheads each ; Trident submarines ; B-1 bombers ; advanced F-16 and F-18 fighters ; precision-guided battlefield weapons ; intermediate-range nuclear missiles like the ground-launched cruise and Pershing 2 , and the M-1 battle tank . The tide of spending seems irreversible . The few protesting voices in Congress are drowned out as the pack in full cry follows the Administration 's commands to " catch up with the Russians " and " rearm America . " The fiscal curmudgeons , those watchdogs of waste and golden fleecings , are out of style , and any proposals of sensible alternatives that might purchase national security at a lower cost , such as the proposal to cancel the B-1 and develop the Stealth bomber instead , go unheard . The magnitude of the Reagan budget explo-sion has caused us to lose sight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes on increasing defense spending in good times and bad , during times of detente and times of confrontation . Save for a few years during the 1970s when the military budget ' remained con-stant in real dollars , the graph line of defense ( Continued on Page 441 ) The Greeks ' Turn r unlike most other publications , The Nation did not find the Greek elections " too close to call " see Christopher Hitchens , " Time for a Change in Greece , " October 10 . The evident thirst for a new kind of government dominated the campaign , and thus it could really have had only one outcome . Even so , the scope of Andreas Papandreou 's victory is extraordinary . He has a working majority in Parliament and a mandate for a socialist transformation that does not depend on the Communists . Despite the right 's compromises with the old monarchist and fascist parties in the closing stages of the contest , it was annihilated . Papandreou 's election is the best news from Europe since the French Fifth Republic was effectively replaced in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will not try to make life easy for the Reagan Administration . They can not afford to . There are too many issues outstanding between the two countries to permit any quick resolution . For instance , even if Papandreou is prevailed upon to retain American bases on Greek soil , he will have to insist that they pass into the hands of a Greek command . Immediately , therefore , the Pentagon would lose one possible launching pad for adventures in the Mediterranean . Again , whatever the temper of his eventual relationship with Turkey , Papandreou has no choice but to repudiate the Turkish military occupation of Cyprus , a nasty feat of arms with which the North Atlantic Treaty Organization has been altogether too comfortable up to now . And the new government has pledged to open all the files of the junta period to a public inquest , something that can only embarrass those elements in the United States that colluded with the seven-year dictatorship . During the campaign , the Administration made no secret of its preference for Papandreou 's opponent , former Prime Minister George @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will now be an ungrudging acceptance of the clear verdict of the Greek people ? It was American policy that led to the military coup of 1967 , to the aggression against Cyprus and nearly to open war between Greece and Turkey . The Greeks have learned from that , and so should Washington . Libel Li Whiplash T he argument is familiar and routinely made by defenders of civil liberties : take away the rights of another today , and your rights may be taken away tomorrow . Though examples are plentiful , it is rare that they illustrate the point as neatly as Kimerli Jayne Pring 's libel suit against Penthouse magazine . Pring , you may recall , was Miss Wyoming in 1978 . She contends that she was libeled by a short story in Penthouse in which there was a character called Miss Wyoming . The real Miss Wyoming and the fictional Miss Wyoming are both blue-eyed blondes , they both wore baby-blue chiffon gowns at the Miss America contest in Atlantic City , and they both performed baton-twirling acts in the pageant 's talent contest . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ readers to conclude that the behavior of the fictional Miss Wyoming was closely modeled on that of the real Miss Wyoming , including the remarkable sexual feats the character in the story performs . Calling this " emotional rape " by the magazine 's 25 million readers , Pring 's lawyers persuaded a Federal jury in Wyoming to order Pent-. house to pay her $25 million in punitive damages and $1.5 million in compensatory damages . The trial judge reduced the punitive damages award by half , which still left Penthouse owing Pring a cool $14 million . Penthouse challenged the lower court 's decision and the size of the damages in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit . It is in Pring 's answer to the magazine 's appeal that we see demonstrated the principle that he who curtails the liberty of another may thereby thi eaten his own . The editor and publisher of Penthouse , Bob Guccione , had himself filed a libel suit some time ago against Hustler , a rival girlie magazine . The amount of damages was also an issue in that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lower court 's award be upheld . Pring and her lawyers obtained a copy of the brief , and , with obvious relish , they quoted lengthy excerpts from it in their own argument before the Tenth Circuit . " Thus sayeth Penthouse , " Pring 's brief concluded . Penthouse 's lawyers are thus put in the awkward position of having to rebut the arguments made in court by the magazine 's publisher . While making Penthouse pay the same magnitude of damages as it tried to extract from Hustler might seem poetic justice , we hope that the Tenth Circuit will not do so . We oppose all libel judgments  --  and especially punitive damages  --  as intrusions on First Amendment rights . What Penthouse tried to do to Hustler and what Pring is trying to do to Penthouse may be done to anyone , perhaps even to Pring some day . The right way to protect liberty is to uphold everyone 's freedom to speak and to publish . That said , we ca n't resist exercising our own free speech and telling Guccione that if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only himself to blame . Self- Containment T he Reagan Administration recently decided to punish Cuba , and the result was a spate of visa denials to Cuban officials , restrictions on the im- portation of Cuban publications and other harass-ments . Those White House pipehners , the columnists Rowland Evans and Robert Novak , explained that the moves were part of " a Reagan Administration get-tough policy against Fidel Castro 's growing support for the leftist insurgency in El Salvador . " Actually , it is doubtful that they will have any more effect on Castro than similar measures did in the past . But therein may lie their greatest danger . The Reagan team made its opening gambit last May when the Treasury Department blocked the delivery of 30,000 copies of Cuban newspapers and magazines that are sent to subscribers in the United States . The scholars and others who receive the publications were told that they must now obtain import licenses . As justification for its double-barreled act of censorship and reader registration , the department cited the Trading With the Enemy Act of 1917 and the Cuban @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ department said , apply solely to trade and commerce ; in other words , it was barring goods , not ideas . But the action taken against Gramma and other Cuban periodicals , whatever its foreign policy ramifications , is a restriction pure and simple on Americans ' right to know . On September 23 , three high-ranking Cuban officials ? Marcelo Fernandez Font , Alberto Betancourt Roa and Richard Alarc6n  --  were barred from a conference on Cuban-U.S. trade relations , under a section of the Immigration and Naturalization Act that gives the executive branch discretionary authority to prevent aliens from entering the United States on foreign policy grounds . The act was invoked again on October 2 against Cuban Vice Foreign Minister Jose R. Viera . The danger is that the Administration will turn to even more aggressive measures , which will further exacerbate tensions between Washington and Havana at a time when relations are nearing a crisis stage . Since tensions in the hemisphere are greater than they have been in years , any escalation of hostility could set off a conflict with global reverberations . Thus , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at worst a threat to peace and at best a containment of American freedom of speech . Inspector 's Call 4 4 here 's an investigator from the welfare department to see you , Mr. Iacocca . " The head of the Chrysler Corporation could n't believe his ears . " What the hell does the welfare department want with me ? " " Something about how many color TVs you own . He says he 's been ordered to stay until you let him inspect your office . " " Show him in , " said Lee Iacocca . The man entered , produced his badge and introduced himself as James Thompson , Federal investigator . " Now what the hell is this all about , Thompson ? " " Well , sir , I hate to disturb you , but we 're under orders to investigate everyone getting Federal welfare to make sure they 're really poor . There 's a $1,000 limit on personal property now . If you have too many microwave ovens or color TV sets around the house , we cut off your benefits . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Not in the usual sense , perhaps . But there is that loan guarantee Congress gave Chrysler ? $1.5 billion , as I recall . " " That 's not welfare . " " Just what I told the poor families I 've been visiting , but they do n't see it that way . They think a billion and a half is a pretty fair chunk of Federal help . Now , sir , under the regulations , I 'm not supposed to take into account your car  --  you do own a car ? " " Of course . " " In addition to the company limousine , I mean ? " " Yes . " " Hmmmm . I guess the rules would exclude the company airplanes too . But we are definitely on the lookout for color TVs  --  is that one in the corner , sir ? " " Why , yes  --  but I need it in my job to keep up with world events . " Thompson pressed a button and a panel slid back , revealing a well-stocked bar . " A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm afraid . We used to overlook those , and other assets like burial plots and life insurance policies , but under the Administration 's new rules , we ca n't miss a thing . Do you have life insurance ? " " Yes , of course . But tell me , Thompson , why are you singling out Chrysler ? " " Oh , we 're not . Day before yesterday , I visited Lockheed  --  as you know , they also got a big government loan guarantee . And yesterday I was over at Exxon . " " Exxon ! You 're not going to tell me they 're on welfare . " " Yes , sir , Just like all the oil companies , they get billions in special tax subsidies . Do you realize that Exxon 's chairman has a large-screen TV in his office ? " " Well , 1 hope you 're going to crack down on him . " " You bet . I 'm going back tomorrow to check a report he 's got a telephone in his car . Wait ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stern is author of The Rape of the Taxpayer ( Random House ) and Lawyers on Trial ( Times Books ) and a correspondent for In The Public Interest . T he possibility of a negotiated settlement to the conflict in El Salvador was revived earlier this month when Daniel Ortega , a member of Nicaragua 's rul- ing junta , presented the Salvadoran opposition 's proposals for a " dialogue of peace " to the U.N . General Assembly . The Salvadoran F.M.L.N.-F.D.R. coalition had authorized Ortega to announce the offer , which includes a proposal for talks without preconditions between the Salvadoran opposition and the Salvadoran junta . These would be conducted in the presence of neutral parties . The talks would seek to define a " new political , economic , and judicial order " and " restructure the armed forces " by integrating opposition- and junta-controlled troops into one force . The Salvadoran government promptly denounced the proposal as " intervention , " and the United States reiterated its support for elections to be held next March . El Salvador and the United States have repeatedly rejected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forces to buy time in order to improve their military position . But Senator Christopher Dodd , Democrat of Connecticut , who went to San Salvador recently to discuss the conditions attached to U.S. military aid , received assurances from high-ranking Christian Democrats that they were willing to initiate " informal , private " talks with the guerrillas . ? Although calling for a " search for peace " in Central America , Ortega set off a new round in the war of words between the United States and Nicaragua in the United Nations by charging elsewhere in his speech that the Reagan Administration 's fiscal and monetary policies have hurt Third World nations . U.S. Deputy Permanent Representative to the United Nations Kenneth Adelman retorted that Nicaragua " lends its territory as a base to export violence and subversion to neighboring countries . " Despite the verbal sparring , however , neither the United States nor Nicaragua is likely to abandon the search for im-proved relations , a process begun last August when Assist-ant Secretary of State for Inter-American Affairs Thomas Enders visited Managua . Enders made it clear that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it must discontinue arms aid to the Salvadoran rebels . The Nicaraguans , for their part , sought U.S. recognition of the Sandinist government as well as the abandonment of policies designed to destabilize it . The Nicaraguans continue to protest the presence of several thousand former members of Anastasio Somoza 's National Guard in H ( Continued on Page 444 ) The tip I got was this : The Reagans decided against attending Anwar elSadat 's funeral not because of the security considerations mentioned by the White House press office but because Mrs. Reagan 's hairdresser had warned that the Cairo humidity might " frizz the hair into a state I simply ca n't be responsible for . " Ever since I broke the story that Mrs. Reagan was under some pressure from the White House staff to check into the hospital for the surgical removal of her adoring smile , I seem to be the reporter people call whenever they want to unload some mean-minded little leak about the First Family . Ironically , what I really want to do is to grapple with the big issues , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sort of thing I spend my time checking out is whether Mrs. Reagan really tried to get the President to fire the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development because he clashed with the new rug in the Cabinet room . It 's pretty easy to get typed in this business . It would n't surprise me to hear that every time Woodward or Bernstein gets himself really wrapped up in reporting a piece on farm price supports or the reorganization of the General Services Administration , someone calls with a tip about some President committing a felony . I was particularly disappointed because I thought the Sadat funeral would result in a lot of important foreign policy leaks  --  particularly after it was announced that Richard Nixon 's parole officer was going to allow him to go along as one of the official American representatives . I expected someone to call and say , " Reagan 's planning to send Billy Sol Estes to Manila as our representative at the Martial Law Celebrations . Check it out " " Why do n't you ever call one of the big-issue columnists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost ? " I asked the hair-frizz leaker . " I tried , " he said . " They 've all got unlisted numbers . " " Do n't you have any big-issue leaks ? " I asked . " The economy , maybe , or Middle East policy ? " " Sure , I got big-issue leaks , " my informant said , sounding a bit offended . " You want a foreign policy leak ? " " Precisely the sort of thing 1 had in mind . " My source paused for a while to build up the suspense . " The Reagans ' interior decorator has been sitting in on National Security Council meetings , " he said . " Also some guy named Adolfo . Check it out . " No matter what is written these days about the romance of investigative reporting , I can tell you that it 's no fun checking out the sort of leaks I get ( " Let me get this straight now : You 're saying , for the record , that the story could n't be true because in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but to go limp ? " ) . No sooner had I decided that the hair-frizz story was untrue  --  the limp-hair denial checked out with some of my sources on the Coast  --  than the telephone rang again . Iknew it was probably another small-bore leaker . " Forget my name , " a voice on the telephone said . " I do n't know your name , " I said . " But I can keep even that on deep background if necessary . " There was a long pause . " Let 's put it this way , " my source finally said . " Do you think it 's appropriate for Mrs Reagan 's hairdresser to be receiving Secret Service protec-tion ? " " Is he really receiving Secret Service protection ? " " Check it out , " the voice said . " Wait ! Do n't hang up , " I said . " I 'd like to talk to you about some big issues . " " You 'll hear from me , " the voice said . " I 'll be phoning in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Mrs. Reagan 's new ballgown compares with the gross national product of Chad . " I started checking out the Secret Service tip ( " Yes , I know you 're busy , but could you just see if one of the people sitting under a dryer near where Mister Marc is working looks like he went to Georgetown and is carrying a gun ? " ) , but I was beginning to grow suspicious . Had n't there been a lot of press lately about the Reagans ' extravagances ? Even some of the big-issue fellows were making a big issue about the new White House china and the President 's $1,000 cowboy boots . I had begun to spot some counterleaks . Coming to the First Family 's defense in his Time column , Hugh Sidey revealed that some of the President 's $1,000 suits were ten years old  --  leaving the implication that a President like Richard Nixon would have long ago given such rags to the thrift shop and taken a $2,800 tax write-off . Could it be that Sidey asked his best White House source @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ session and was instead given a tour of Reagan 's closet ? ( " This double vent was never used by Beverly Hills tailors after 1974 , Hugh . You can check it out . " ) Why ? The tip-off came in a New York Times piece headlined " First Lady Tells Critics ' I Am Just Being Myself . ' " Is it possible that nobody in the White House knew that this was precisely the same phrase used by Marie Antoinette when she was criticized for throwing squab carcasses at the peasants ? I think not . I began to get the feeling that we were being set up to provoke a backlash sympathetic to Mrs. Reagan  --  and maybe even to her hairdresser . She would he presented as a decent wife and mother who had been gang-slurred by a vicious mob of secular humanists . " Did you check out the Secret Service story ? " my source asked the next morning " Secret Service protection for Mrs. Reagan 's hairdresser seems perfectly reasonable to me , " I said . " If the Commies got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Japanese listening devices in her follicles . " " How about the cost of the ballgown ? " he said . " The Reagans earned their money , " I said . " If you think playing second lead to a chimp is an easy way to make a living , you 've never tried it . I wish you would n't keep calling with this sort of stuff .
