Former U.S. Rep. Tom Corcoran , who lost a 1984 primary contest to then- U.S. Sen. Charles Percy , is now considered the leading GOP prospect to run against Democratic Sen. Alan Dixon next year , according to Republican strategists . Lt. Gov . George Ryan said Thursday that he also has been approached by the National Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee , which is seeking a strong challenger to Dixon in 1986 , and did not rule out the possibility that he might make the race if Gov . James Thompson asks him . Thompson is unlikely to do that now that Corcoran has emerged as a willing contender . Thompson and U.S. Sen. John Heinz ( R. , Pa. ) , chairman of the GOP Senate campaign committee , have urged Corcoran to run . Party officials are making a strong effort to field an alternative to State Rep. Judy Koehler ( R. , Henry ) , a little-known conservative who is given little chance against the popular Dixon . Though Thompson reportedly had been interested in testing Ryan as a possible Senate contender , he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prospect of a Corcoran candidacy . Thompson has indicated that if Corcoran runs , the governor wants to retain Ryan as his running mate for lieutenant governor in the 1986 election . Ryan is scheduled to meet this week in Springfield with Tim Hyde of the GOP Senate campaign committee . " I ' m going to listen to what they have to say , " the Kankakee Republican said . Corcoran , who has a $250 , 000 debt remaining from his unsuccessful 1984 primary campaign , said this week that he is seeking campaign funding commitments from the GOP Senate campaign committee and others before deciding whether to run . As leaders of both parties work to complete their 1986 slates , former U.S. Sen. Adlai Stevenson , now the only candidate for the Democratic nomination for governor , is continuing his search for a running mate . Democratic sources said Thursday that Stevenson is giving serious consideration to State Sen. Vince Demuzio ( D. , Carlinville ) . Stevenson reportedly conferred Wednesday with two other possibilities for lieutenant governor , Ald. Martin Oberman ( 43d ) and State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but made no commitment . Oberman has indicated that if he isn ' t picked for the No. 2 slot , he will remain in the contest for attorney general against incumbent Neil Hartigan , whose decision to withdraw from the race for governor this week assured Stevenson ' s renomination for governor . Some Democratic strategists are concerned that State Treasurer James Donnewald would have serious trouble winning renomination in the party primary if , as widely expected , he is challenged by Commissioner Patrick Quinn of the Cook County Board of ( tax ) Appeals . Because of those fears , several Democrats are maneuvering to replace him on the slate to be endorsed later this month by the Illinois Democratic Central Committee . Former State Treasurer Jerome Cosentino and State Sen. Dawn Clark Netsch ( D. , Chicago ) are vying for the spot . But Dixon and State Senate President Philip Rock ( D. , Oak Park ) are expected to press hard for Donnewald ' s retention on the ticket .
