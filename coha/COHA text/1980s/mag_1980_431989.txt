 | Since that day when Ecclesiastes complained that there is no end to the making of books , we have learned a thing or two : now we design books to self-destruct . The pages of many books printed today resemble European toilet paper and are so ineptly glued together that they spring to the floor as soon as the book is opened ; those that remain will turn brown within two years and disintegrate within two decades . So much for an author 's dream of immortality ; his book will collapse before he does . In such a climate , it is a pleasure to salute a masterpiece of the art of book production . " The Plan of St. Gall , " a meticulously detailed examination of monastic life in the Carolingian era , represents the labor of twenty years . Walter Horn , an art historian , spent seven years on the text ; Ernest Born , an architect , took another thirteen to create the architectural drawings and assemble the hundreds of plans , woodcuts , illuminations , manuscript pages and photographs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ publishers half a million dollars ? a daunting sum , even if some of it was recovered from foundations and private grants . Fortunately , the resulting elegance has a seemliness about it : the size of the volumes , the rich paper , the boldly classical typeface and the bindings of heavy buckram all suggest the weightiness of medieval books . It is fitting , too , that so grand an enterprise should be about an idea of perfection . What the authors have done is to re-create from an existing ninth-century ground plan the entire fabric of an exemplary Carolingian monastery and the entire lives of the people , both religious and secular , that it enclosed . If the resulting book is primarily an architectural monograph , it is also a study of medieval technology and an examination of early medieval attitudes toward religion , hospitality , medicine , education , complex industrial activities , gardening and the breeding of livestock . A sense of the broad scope of this narrowly focused work can be gained by glancing at a single page of the index . There , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; barbers , bloodletting performed by ; barley ; barns ; barrels ; bathhouses ; bathing , medieval views on ; Bayeux Tapestry ; the Venerable Bede ; beds , size of ; beekeeping ; beer ; bells ; benches , and Saint Benedict of Nursia . So attentive is the authors ' scrutiny of every hinge and herb in this community that it is hard to bear in mind that this monastery never existed . There was a monastery at St. Gall in Switzerland , but the plan from which this book derives was unsuited to its site . This plan was intended to represent what an ideal monastery might be , according to the monastic reforms instigated by Saint Benedict . It is , according to Horn , " a mosaic of perfect order and rationality . " From the thin red lines drawn on five pieces of calfskin stitched together , Horn is able to infer just what this order was , from its broadest perspective , which deals with the arrangement of the community 's 40 buildings to isolate the monks from visitors and secular laborers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number 40 in the measurements of the monastery 's church . Temptation : Between these two extremes come the most interesting revelations of monastic discipline . The Benedictine rule , though more moderate than its predecessors , was suspicious of comfort The monks slept fully clothed , to avoid delay between awakening and attending to God 's work . Barring sickness , they were forbidden the meat of four-footed animals because of its pleasurable taste . Their refectory was kept unheated lest the monks linger over the one meal they were allowed each day in winter . Baths , another sensual indulgence , were restricted to Christmas and Easter and might never be taken in groups . Bloodletting , a traditional remedy for a variety of complaints , attracted the monks because it was accompanied by increased measures of food , wine and rest . Because the monastery was designed to be self-sufficient , many secular craftsmen labored within its walls to provide whatever was necessary to the community . Horn emphasizes the innovations that monasteries contributed to a rural economy : in @# @#  | heating , the use of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and intellectual history . By analyzing ( in a lengthy section devoted to monastery privies ) the ratio of toilet seats to the number of potential users , Horn demonstrates that the standards of hygiene in his exemplary monastery were " conspicuously superior to common standards of modern sanitation . " " The Plan of St. Gall " is , beyond any doubt , one of the great feats of modern historical reconstruction . Its text , for all its erudition and determination to set right the errors of previous scholars , is lucid and accessible to the layman ; its many . hundred illustrations of constructions and activities ranging from Syria to Ireland relate the basic plan to earlier and later forms of architecture and technology . Besides , it is a pleasure to the eye and hand ; like a medieval abbot , the authors appear to have surveyed the corruption all about them and determined to establish an example of perfection . In this they have succeeded . @#                    @
