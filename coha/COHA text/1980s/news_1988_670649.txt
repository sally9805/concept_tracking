But that has suddenly changed . Owners of asbestos-filled buildings are having more difficulty attracting tenants . Sellers have to offer steep discounts . And buyers are having trouble lining up lenders or investors. // The key reason for the turnabout is new state laws . Led by New York , 22 states have adopted anti-asbestos laws in the last year alone , raising the number of states regulating asbestos to 38 , according to Asbestos Abatement Report , a newsletter . It is only a matter of time , experts say , before the remaining states pass asbestos laws , which typically require a landlord to remove asbestos before a building is demolished or renovated and regulate how it shall be removed. // " Over the last two years , asbestos has really taken off as a problem , " said Kevin F. Haggarty , executive vice president of Cushman &; Wakefield Inc. , a national real estate firm . " You ' re seeing a much smaller universe of players willing to get involved " with buildings containing asbestos . <> <> Outlawed in the 70 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1970 ' s , asbestos was used to insulate , soundproof and fireproof buildings . The vast majority of buildings constructed in major cities between 1920 and 1970 contain asbestos . These structures include some of New York ' s most famous - from the Pan Am Building to Madison Square Garden. // Now , in the wake of the new laws , real estate professionals say prices for asbestos-containing office buildings have fallen 5 to 10 percent in Manhattan and even more in other cities . That can translate into tens of millions of dollars when such buildings command hundreds of millions of dollars. // " I don ' t know one who will buy a building with asbestos , " said Mr. Haggarty of the dozen or so Japanese insurers he deals with. // Such companies as the International Business Machines Corporation and reportedly the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company will not lease office space in buildings containing asbestos. // And fearing a tide of asbestos-related lawsuits , institutional investors - including banks , pension funds and insurance companies - are increasingly refusing to lend against or buy into asbestos-containing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , owners , contractors , anybody who had anything to do with a building could be the object of a lawsuit , " said Daniel J. Sitomer of Sitomer &; Drexler , a New York law firm specializing in asbestos cases. // For years , scientists have argued that asbestos fibers , while safe when contained , can cause cancer when torn from walls and ceilings and allowed to float freely in the air . Only in the last 12 to 18 months , however , as states began to adopt ordinances requiring the removal of asbestos before renovation , has the real estate industry begun to consider the harmful impact of asbestos . <> <> A Sensitive Issue // Understandly , asbestos remains a sensitive issue . Of three major insurers that invest in real estate - Prudential , Metropolitan Life and Equitable - only Equitable agreed to discuss asbestos in an interview. // Moreover , when asked to discuss buildings where asbestos has impaired value , killed a sale or prevented financing , ordinarily outgoing real estate professionals will not talk . They say that once it becomes public that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ building could be in trouble for years. // " These people are still trying to sell their buildings , " said John S. Lillard , president of JMB Institutional Realty Inc . The Chicago-based real estate investment firm says it has walked away from more than a half-dozen purchases in the last year because the buildings contained asbestos . <> <> ' An Economic Factor ' // Real estate specialists who requested anonymity identified several notable deals affected by asbestos : // * The Chase Manhattan Bank has been having trouble selling 1 New York Plaza , an office tower that went on the market last winter . In response , a Chase lawyer called asbestos " simply an economic factor for buyers to consider . " He added , " It is not the kind of thing that would cause an otherwise interested buyer to change its mind. " // * When the General Electric Company recently tried to refinance the Gulf and Western Building , a high-rise at Columbus Circle in Manhattan that G.E. jointly owns , a major insurer refused to lend . Even when G.E. offered to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the interest rate it would pay on the loan by one-half percentage point , the insurer still said no . Jonathan Wexler , a partner at the First Winthrop Corporation , G.E. ' s partner , agreed that the effort to refinance the building ran into difficulty because of asbestos . But he said plans to refinance it were scrapped for other reasons. // * If the Exxon Building at 1251 Avenue of the Americas at 50th Street had not contained asbestos , a dozen or so bidders would probably have competed for the building , sold in late 1986 . Instead , the auction attracted only three serious bidders , people familiar with the deal say , and the ultimate buyer , Mitsui of Japan , cut its price by more than $20 million when it learned it would have to spend that much to remove the asbestos . Edward S. Gordon , president of the Edward S. Gordon Company , the real estate firm that arranged the deal , declined to comment. // * In 1986 , both the Shuwa Corporation , a big Japanese real estate company , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bids lower for the ARCO Plaza , a huge office complex in downtown Los Angeles , after learning it contained asbestos . Shuwa bought the building . <> <> Sales Eventually Made // That most buildings containing asbestos have eventually been sold and financed suggests that asbestos is a hurdle that can be cleared . Indeed , a minority of real estate professionals take the view that asbestos has simply become another cost of doing business. // They calculate the cost of asbestos removal at $5 to $30 a square foot , depending on whether the material is throughout a building or only in selected areas . They estimate " down " time - when a building must remain vacant while the asbestos is being removed . And they estimate how much less rent an asbestos building can command. // They also say that while more costly , financing of asbestos-containing buildings can be obtained . Although rules of thumb are rough , lending experts say asbestos can increase the interest rate on a loan by one-half to one percentage point. // " If the conditions are right - if the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Craig M. Hatkoff , a managing director of the Chemical Realty Group , the real estate arm of the Chemical Bank . <> <> When It ' s Not a Problem // Other experts note that asbestos is often not a problem - for instance , when it is wrapped around a few pipes in a building ' s boiler room . Others note that in New York City , such factors as location are far more important in determining value than asbestos. // " I ' d rather have an asbestos-filled building on Park Avenue than a clean building on Second Avenue , " said John Forelle , a partner at Simpson Thacher &; Bartlett , a law firm that represents Japanese investors in real estate. // Still , a growing number of people in the real estate industry want to avoid asbestos-filled buildings. // Besides worrying about the cost of removing the asbestos , these people have another worry : how much lenders or owners will have to pay if they are sued by cancer victims for owning or financing a building that has asbestos. // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issue , building owners would appear more vulnerable than lenders . Owners of properties of all types are responsible for maintaining safe conditions inside their buildings . <> <> Lenders Also Fearful // But lenders also fear being taken to court by victims of illness who might argue that the lenders never should have facilitated the sale of a building. // " Nobody is really sure how far the liability extends , " said Mr. Sitomer , the asbestos lawyer . " Banks are concerned that if they foreclose on the building , they are responsible for that asbestos. " // In fact , according to Mr. Sitomer , the concern does not stop there . Because Federal and state laws dictate how asbestos shall be transported and disposed of , banks fear they could be sued if the asbestos is mishandled long after being removed from their buildings , he said. // Yet another fear , he and others say , is that asbestos laws will become stricter , placing greater pressure on building owners to remove asbestos and making loan defaults more likely. // The result is great uncertainty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lenders are willing to bear . The net result could be fewer players in real estate lending , still higher rates on loans , and higher rents as landlords pass on their increased costs to tenants . I.B.M. //
