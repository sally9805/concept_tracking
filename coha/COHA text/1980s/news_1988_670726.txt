But , produced and directed by Jerry London and boasting splendid performances , " Dadah Is Death " plunges on , giving us Julie Christie as Barbara Barlow , the woman fiercely determined to save her son Kevin ( John Polson ) from hanging . Perhaps the executive producers , Steve Krantz and Matt Carroll , thought they saw an opportunity to whip up another " Midnight Express . " This mini-series spends a great deal of time in dank , dark prisons crawling with rats and sadistic guards . At the very beginning we meet Kevin and his Australian partner , Geoff Chambers ( Hugo Weaving ) , on the morning of July 7 , 1986 , as the gallows are being prepared for them . There are subsequently no surprises and little suspense . We know what is in store for these unfortunate young men , both in their 20 ' s. // Reverting to an extended flashback , Bill Kerby ' s screenplay is irritatingly vague on some key points . It ' s 1983 , and Kevin is returning to his family in Adelaide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boasts the tattoo " I Hate Cops , " which does not endear him to the local police . The family is on the dole , and Mrs. Barlow seems to have an oddly distant relationship with her meek husband , Wilf ( Robin Ramsey ) . Nevertheless , Kevin seems to be a well-meaning fellow . Moving to Perth on his own , he tries to find a job and settle down with a woman but is frustrated at every turn . Enter Geoff , a suave heroin dealer , who has an offer too good for Kevin to pass up : a drug deal that will net Kevin $6 , 000 and a week ' s vacation at the same time. // Malaysia ' s strict new laws about drugs , or dadah , were no secret at the time . The cities of Kuala Lumpur and Panang are covered with giant " Dadah Is Death " posters . When Kevin and Geoff , seen openly smoking marijuana , are arrested for possessing nearly 180 grams of heroin , they know the seriousness of their situation . But then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aid of newspaper reporters and the Australian Broadcasting Company . It ' s an admirable crusade in many ways , but her position is never quite clear . On the one hand , she is protesting the death penalty . On the other , she is insisting that her son is absolutely innocent . Even the film admits evidence to the contrary . At its core , " Dadah Is Death " turns out to be curiously muddled. // It can also be silly , as with the character of Rachel Goldman ( Sarah Jessica Parker ) , a young American woman who inexplicably falls in love with the imprisoned Kevin and even manages to wrangle a romantic interlude for the requisite sex sequence . And " Dadah Is Death " can also be downright spurious , as when the final hanging scene is followed with the heavy-breathing intensity of a demented voyeur . Grown professionals must have something better to do with their money . <> <> ' The Mikado ' // Never having been a fervent Gilbert and Sullivan fan , I can sit though Jonathan Miller ' s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charmed . But Gilbert and Sullivan purists may quite justifiably be infuriated . As an enfant terrible in perpetuity , Mr. Miller is once again going about his business of pulling things apart and putting them back together again in a manner calculated to , at the very least , wrench attention . Mr. Miller was the director , you may recall , who decided to reset " Rigoletto " in New York ' s Little Italy of the 1950 ' s. // He has now decided that there is simply no reason for " The Mikado " to be Japanese . His rationale : " As soon as you hear the dialogue and the songs , it ' s quite clearly just the English being silly . " Well if it is silliness you want , Mr. Miller is eager to oblige . His " Mikado " is done in the style of a 1930 ' s film musical starring the Marx Brothers . The setting is an Art Deco seaside resort bursting with dancing chambermaids and bellhops . Black and white are the primary colors . Even the potted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shown on Channel 13 tonight at 9 as part of PBS ' s " Great Performances " series . Directed by John Michael Phillips and produced by Thames Television , it is a tape of Mr. Miller ' s stage production performed before an audience . The English National Opera orchestra and chorus is conducted by Peter Robinson . Played in the exaggerated manner of an English pantomime , this interpretation may remind some people less of the Marx Brothers than of the 1950 ' s musical " The Boy Friend . " Mr. Phillips does try to give a Busby Berkeley veneer to the proceedings with some kaleidoscopic special effects , but these succeed merely in looking chintzy. // Perhaps best capturing the spirit of the occasion , Eric Idle , formerly of the Monty Python zanies , plays Ko-Ko , the Lord High Executioner and , among his other titles , Archbishop of Titipu and Chief Rabbi . Running through a variety of accents , Mr. Idle has a fine time , especially when compiling a list of victims , society offenders who never would be missed . Among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' t believe in God and constables who do , joggers , floggers , critics , comedians and , of course , Australians of all kinds . The production is not especially kind either to the Japanese . Eyes are occasionally pulled into sterotypical slits , and the tradition of bowing is referred to as " an abject grovel in the Nipponese manner " or , in a pinch , " just a tiny little grovelette. " // Some of the adjustments make no sense at all . Katisha , for instance , is played wonderfully by Felicity Palmer in the broad , haughtily ridiculous manner of Margaret Dumont . It works well until Katisha has her quietly touching solo near the end of the second act . The switch from farce to pathos is jarring at best. // But with Sue Blane ' s wittily attractive costumes , this production is a delight to watch . And it sounds superb . The fine cast also includes Bonaventura Bottone as Nanki-Poo , in university blazer and boater ; Lesley Garrett as Yum-Yum ; Richard Van Allan as Pooh-Bah , Yum-Yum ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the **25;110889;TOOLONG uniform of Sydney Greenstreet , Richard Angas as the Mikado. // Mr. Miller has insisted that " I don ' t want to send up the opera , I want to send up the English . " Needless to say , he has done both. //
