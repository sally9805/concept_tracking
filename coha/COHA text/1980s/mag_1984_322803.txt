" We owe them what we are today " <P> Forty summers ago , they had sailed in the dark through howling winds and driving rain and later seen the sea behind them turn crimson with blood . Last week they arrived by bus and chartered plane , and the waves were calm , the heavens benign . The serene afternoon perfectly suited their mission : they had come to the windswept bluffs and lonely beaches of Normandy to encounter long-lost friends and to mourn those lost forever . <P> More than 4,000 veterans of D-day joined 6,000 other guests at Utah Beach last Wednesday , on the invasion 's 40th anniversary . As the heads of state of eight wartime allies looked on , color guards slowly hoisted flags up eight tall poles , and eight national anthems rang out across the hazy air . At sea , where eight gray battleships idly drifted , the French destroyer Montcalm let off a 21-gun salute , and eight French Alpha jets roared through the sky , leaving red , white and blue trails of smoke . <P> Stepping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President Franois Mitterrand gallantly stressed that " the enemy of that time was not Germany but the power , the system , the ideology that held Germany in its grip . " Mitterrand went on to applaud " the heroism of the Russian people . " His main purpose , however , was to give thanks to the 10,000 Allied soldiers who lost their lives on D-day while helping to deliver France from captivity . " We owe them what we are today , " said Mitterrand , " and I sometimes ask myself if we have ever paid them back all that we owe . " <P> Yet amid the flawless pageantry , last Wednesday was , at heart , a day for silence and solitary reflection . Gray-haired by now , or balding , or round of girth , most of the returning veterans chose to observe their own private rituals of remembrance . During the long hours of waiting , they could be seen reminiscing with buddies , or recounting their deeds to wives and children and children 's children , or simply gazing out to sea . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 29th Infantry Division , could only marvel at the dizzying sea of white crosses and Stars of David at Omaha Beach , where 9,386 G.I.s are buried . " If anything of this kind has to exist , " he said , his eyes filled with tears , " this is about as fine a tribute as they could create . " <P> Fine tributes came too from President Reagan at Pointe du Hoc , a rugged promontory jutting into the English Channel . Soon after dawn on Dday , 225 U.S. Rangers began to scale the sheer cliffs , inching upward under a hail of murderous gunfire ; after two days of combat , only 90 could still fight . Last week 62 Rangers returned to the site . " These are the boys of Pointe du Hoc , " read the President . " These are the champions who helped free a continent . " Some of the men being congratulated for their toughness had to take off their glasses to brush away tears .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
