He 'll be there at the final Four , the magic land that many thought he would never enter without buying a ticket . Meet Boeheim Agonistes . Each coach will bring something special to New Orleans : Jerry Tarkanian , a towel to suck on ; Bob Knight , an ill-fitting red sweater ; Rick Pitino , a pocketful of miracles ; James Boeheim .... Well , the Syracuse coach will bring tortoiseshell glasses and a thin skin . // He 'll also bring a very good team . Syracuse beat North Carolina 79-75 in the East Regional on Saturday at the Meadowlands to end 10 years of frustration for Boeheim , who had long been considered the reason that Syracuse carried an apple as well as its symbolic orange into postseason play . Boeheim has a winning percentage of .758 in 11 seasons at Syracuse , yet he was best known as the coach whose talent-rich teams had never won more than one game in eight NCAA appearances . " I admit I 'm sensitive , " he says . " I read everything negative written @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of approval he so desperately craved never seemed to be forthcoming . // Until last week . Boeheim beat a Carolina team of which Dean Smith had said , " This is a great team , and we do n't use the word ' great ' very often . " Indeed , the top-seeded Tar Heels seemed to have , as Boeheim had said before the game , " all the answers , both inside and outside . " Two of them were All-America senior point guard Kenny Smith , who is both bolt-of-lightning penetrator and three-point threat , and freshman center J.R . Reid , who had made his last 10 field-goal attempts to finish with 31 points in the Tar Heels ' 74-68 semifinal victory over Notre Dame . // What North Carolina lacked was blue-collar sensibility . The senior class , led by Smith and forward Joe Wolf , had a four-year record of 115-22 but never won an ACC tournament or made the Final Four . The Tar Heels were fast , strong and smart , but they were n't tough . Dean Smith may have recognized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the offensive boards and 29-21 overall . // " I know we ca n't let that happen in the final , " he said . But it did . Syracuse 's 29-12 halftime edge in rebounding was the primary reason that it led 41-30 ( Reid had zero rebounds in the first 20 minutes , while Syracuse 's fab frosh , Derrick Coleman , had 10 ) , and the Orangemen finished with a 42-32 edge on the boards . North Carolina ate quiche . Syracuse , now 23-1 in games in which it outrebounded opponents , ate glass . // Still , after Smith , who scored 20 second-half points , made a three-pointer to slash Syracuse 's lead to 76-73 with 2:04 left , it looked as though the Orangemen would choke once again . Both point guard Sherman Douglas ( at 1:22 ) and Coleman ( at 0:41 ) missed the front ends of one-and-ones . However , both times Carolina failed to connect at the other end , and the Orangemen grabbed the ensuing rebounds . Finally , Syracuse guard Greg Monroe made two free throws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ice the win . // When Dwayne ( Pearl ) Washington bolted Syracuse for the NBA last year , following his junior season , the Orangemen seemed to lack a quarterback . But they found one in Douglas , who if not for the Pearl 's defection would have spent most of this season chatting with Monsignor Charles Borgornoni , the campus priest in the orange sweater , who sits on the end of the Syracuse bench . ( When asked after the Carolina game if he planned to go to New Orleans , Father Borgornoni responded , " Is the Pope Catholic ? " ) // Douglas had 10 assists in Syracuse 's 87-81 semifinal win over Florida . He then dished out nine against the Heels while scoring 24 points . He throws up more lobs than a clay-court hacker , but on Saturday most of them found their way into the sure hands of junior center Rony Seikaly for dunks . " It must be something he invented , " said Kenny Smith . " I ca n't imagine a coach telling him to lob that much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sherman 's play , " says Boeheim . " I ca n't take credit for that . " // Nor does Boeheim take credit for the ascendance of Seikaly , suddenly the country 's best collegiate pivotman not wearing Navy dress blues . Assistant coach Bernie Fine works with Seikaly daily because , says Boeheim , working with him " drove me crazy . " A native of Lebanon who was raised there and later in Greece , Seikaly came to Syracuse with classic good looks , a pleasing personality , loads of money and rudimentary basketball skills . // " I do n't even want to say how bad he was , " says Boeheim . But ... Rony , Rony , Jim went on living and kept on forgiving because ... he saw a 6 ' 10 " stud with athletic talent . Boeheim 's patience paid off as Seikaly did a Bill Walton impression in both regional games . He worked for position , caught the ball confidently , made thoughtful but decisive moves , dunked and bounced feathery shots off the glass . He had a total @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and was named the regional 's most outstanding player . He also uttered the most outstanding malapropism . Said Seikaly in the press conference after the victory over Florida , " This is the most tasteful game . " // Speaking of taste , it 's a good thing the NCAA does n't rule on questions of neatness , otherwise it would have to decide whether to force the gangly , 6 ' 9 " Coleman to tuck in his jersey . The wayward singlet constantly hangs over Coleman 's shorts and makes him look like the second coming of Jumpin ' Johnny Green . " I know everybody 's thinking , There 's a typical inner-city kid looking all sloppy , " says Coleman , who comes from Detroit . " But I tuck it in , and it just comes out again . Anyway , it makes me play looser when it 's out . " // Both Florida and North Carolina wish his jersey had stayed in . In the semifinal , Coleman 's block of an Andrew Moten drive with 5:10 to go keyed a decisive 11-4 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made only 2 of 10 field goals , but he pulled down a game-high 14 rebounds and blocked three shots . He may never match the pivot moves of his freshman rival , Reid , but he could blossom into a Russell-like defender . // The Douglas-Seikaly-Coleman trio needs the dual anchors of seniors Howard Triche , an outstanding defender , and Monroe , a three-point specialist . In fact , all will have to play well in New Orleans because Syracuse lacks depth . The Orangemen will also need astute guidance from the bench . " See , most of all , I 'd like people to be neutral about my coaching , " said Boeheim . " I 'd like people to say , ' He 's not real good , but he 's not bad , either . ' " // If the Orangemen win it all , Boeheim will be a lot better than not bad .
