 | In his three years as chaplain of the Senate , the Rev. Richard C. Halverson has gotten a pretty good idea of which way his flock is likely to stray , and so last week ? on the day the Senate was about to begin its debate over the proposed constitutional amendment authorizing prayer in the public schools ? his invocation consisted of a fervent prayer against the sin of oversimplification . " Loving God ... " Halverson prayed , " we so easily assume that there are only two sides ... Help us to see that there are at least three sides ? mine , the other one , and God 's . " This useful advice was promptly ignored by the amendment 's proponents and opponents alike ? and both sides argued as if every word they uttered had been whispered in their ears by the Founding Fathers . The epic debate was , in part , just as it was billed : a struggle between those two great principles embodied , respectively , in the First Amendment and the First Commandment. * But it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ irreducible niggles over whether the rights of dissenting third graders were better guaranteed by individual praying , group praying , silent praying or nothing at all . At the same time , of course , the struggle was infused with the frenzy of electoral politics ? partly a move to energize the religious right in preparation for Ronald Reagan 's re-election campaign , partly a plot to embarrass Democrats by forcing them to vote against a measure that , posed in the abstract , had the support of 81 percent of the public in a Gallup poll last year . The schoolprayer vote " can be used against certain people who are flaky , " gleefully declared Gary Jarmin , legislative director of the conservative lobbying group Christian Voice . In the Saddle : The start of the debate more or less coincided with Reagan 's appearance at a conference of evangelical ministers in Columbus , Ohio , that produced frontpage pictures of the president with his face clenched in prayer . House Speaker Thomas P. ( Tip ) O'Neill suspects that on Sundays , Reagan is far more likely to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has attended services only once ( in South Korea ) since last June . A White House spokesman gave assurances that Reagan is " a very active worshiper , privately " ? but prefers not to disrupt church services with the distractions of presidential security . The opposition to the amendment is being led , in fact , not by a Democrat , but by a moderate Republican , Connecticut 's Lowell Weicker , who launched an impassioned , high-volume dialogue against the measure , which he said would put " government . . . in this business of religion . " On the other side was Utah 's soft-spoken conservative Sen. Orrin Hatch and the Senate majority leader , Howard Baker , who may have seen the measure as a way to win friends among the New Right for his own expected presidential race in 1988 . " The question , " said Baker , " is whether government can prohibit the free exercise of religion anywhere . The Constitution plainly says it can not . " Hatch 's strategy was to forgo histrionics and attempt to fine-tune the amendment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a two-thirds majority of the Senate ? a goal that was still narrowly out of reach last week , as Baker implied in postponing the decisive vote on the amendment . Torrent : In the nation at large , support for school prayer is broad , but not especially fervent ? even Phyllis Schlafly , the tireless conservative lecturer , admits that " it 's not a hot topic to speak about " ? except in the evangelical community . Video ministers unleashed a torrent of calls that doubled the normal traffic on congressional switchboards last week , and busloads of the Rev. Jerry Falwell 's Liberty Baptist College students forged a human chain between the Supreme Court and the Capitol . The opposition to the measure was led by civil-liberties groups , backed by most mainline Protestant and Jewish organizations . ( The Roman Catholic Church , while favoring school prayer in principle , says this version does not go far enough and is staying out of this fight . ) None of these groups is working as hard to defeat the amendment as the evangelicals @#  | are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with support ? although his office did release one telegram encouraging him to " keep up the good work " ? signed , " Your pal , Satan . " The lesson of last week 's debates may havebeen that the amendment 's supporters have set themselves an impossible task in attempting to use the blunt instrument of a constitutional amendment to address an issue of such complexity , in an area where no one is even certain what the law is now . The amendment is aimed at reversing a pair of Supreme Court rulings in the early 1960s that outlawed the daily Bible readings and prayer recitations that had been common in many school districts . Its supporters , including Reagan , have sometimes talked as though these rulings prohibited children from praying . " Has n't something gone haywire , " Reagan told his Columbus audience , " when this great Constitution of ours is invoked to allow Nazis and Ku Klux Klansmen to march on public property ... but it supposedly prevents our children from Bible study or the saying of a simple prayer in their schools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ argued that this is not exactly the case ? precisely the point Weicker tried to hammer home all week . Children , he said , are and always have been free to pray " when they get up to bat , during lunch hour or before a math exam . " Nor have these decisions prevented schools from instituting a period for silent prayer or meditation . An Alabama case that challenges the constitutionality of a " moment of silence " law may be heard by the Supreme Court this term ; constitutional scholars ? noting the court 's decision last week in favor of certain Christmas Nativity displays on municipal property ( box ) ? consider it likely that at least the same majority would uphold a minute of silence in the schools . The amendment , moreover , would not return matters exactly to the situation of 25 years ago . One of the practices the Supreme Court struck down was that of having schoolchildren recite a prayer composed by a state board of regents ; recognizing that state-written prayer would be intolerable to almost everyone in the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But if the government does n't write the prayer , who would ? Or who would choose it ? Hatch thinks the teacher can do it ; Baker thinks that schoolchildren will choose one ; the Rev. Jerry Falwell , appearing on a television talk show last week , suggested that each child could lead the class in prayer by turns . And what if one child wanted to read from the Koran ? Or the sayings of Chairman Mao ? Who decides what is prayer ? Would the result be , as Weicker scornfully predicted , an innocuous " to-whom-itmay-concern prayer ? " Or , as opponents fear , would the largest and loudest religion prevail in each classroom ? an objection that gave rise last week to a proposed additional clause requiring school authorities to provide a place for students to go if they choose not to pray . Whether or not that would solve the problem , it has a slightly desperate , jury-rigged quality for a constitutional amendment ? raising the question of whether it 's worth all that effort to achieve a great national consensus on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that no amount of politicking can ever hope to resolve .
