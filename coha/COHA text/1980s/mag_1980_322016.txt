How to keep them <P> Federal officials intent on shielding records from journalists , biographers and other inquirers may have hit upon a very simple way : remove the files from the agency involved before anyone seeks access under the Freedom of Information Act ( FOIA ) .

They said that the records of phone conversations he made while serving as the President 's National Security Adviser should remain under wraps , but that those from his 3 years at State were within the reach of the FOIA . In December 1976 , shortly before he left office , Kissinger donated these documents to the Library of Congress ( which is not covered by the FOIA ) under a complex deed that limits access to them until the year 2001 at the earliest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were made by the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press and other groups , the Supreme Court concluded that State could not be said to be wrongfully " withholding " the documents . The proper remedy , said the majority , is the Federal Records Act , which allows agencies to seek retrieval of files they believe should not have been removed . State has not yet decided whether to pursue Kissinger 's records . <P> As with last month 's Snepp decision , which backed the CIA 's right to enforce its secrecy pledge on former agents , the new ruling is likely to help Government keep a tighter lid on its secrets .
