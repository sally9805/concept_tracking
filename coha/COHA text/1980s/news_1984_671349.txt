The bank holding company , the 47th largest in the country , with assets of $6. 65 billion , has bank branches throughout its home state of North Carolina and mortgage offices throughout the Southeast . Next it wants to entice out-of-state customers to deposit their money with First Union as well as to get their mortgages from it. // And down the line , assuming Congress permits it , First Union hopes to offer commercial loans and combine the pieces into a full-service interstate banking network. // " It ' s admittedly like trying to put Humpty Dumpty together , " said Edward E. Crutchfield Jr. , the company ' s chairman and chief executive officer. // <> <> The Non-Bank Bank // But he and a host of other banks and bank holding companies are determined to try . Their newest gambit is the so-called non-bank bank - a bank that eludes Congress ' s statutory definition of a bank by offering either to make commercial loans or accept demand deposits , but not both. // First Union is but one of 28 bank holding companies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permission to establish some 200 offices across state lines in 91 cities. // The rush was touched off by the Federal Reserve Board ' s March 23 decision granting the U.S. Trust Company of New York the right to expand its trust company in Florida into a bank that would accept deposits and make consumer loans , but not commercial loans . The Fed ruled , reluctantly , that such institutions were exempt from the law prohibiting bank holding companies from owning banks in more than one state unless state laws allow such purchases . But the Fed urged Congress to close the legal loophole. // At the end of its first quarter , First Union , based in Charlotte , N.C. , had 389 offices in the United States and abroad , according to Barbara Massa , a bank spokesman . It wants to expand its operations in the seven Southern states where it already grants mortgages : Alabama , Texas , Tennessee , Florida , South Carolina , Georgia and Virginia. // In 1983 , First Union had net income of $58. 5 million . About 20 percent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cameron Brown Company , which offers first mortgages , and the First Union Mortgage Corporation , which offers second mortgages , Mr. Crutchfield said. // <> <> A ' Big Customer Base ' // First Union plans to offer banking services through its expanded offices in conjunction with these mortgage companies and First Union ' s discount brokerage services . With both subsidiaries making mortgage loans , Mr. Crutchfield said , " that ' s a big customer base for a bank. " // The new venture - which First Union has not yet named - would solicit deposits and use them as a basis for lending or to finance expansion of its mortgage business . For example , Mr. Crutchfield said , it might issue certificates of deposit and use the money to bring in a First Union Mortgage branch alongside a Cameron Brown branch. // " Nobody can be sure that deposit- taking offices make sense , " Mr. Crutchfield said . " I don ' t want to pretend we ' ve got a huge war room up here . But this is a new crack in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of us are saying we don ' t know the eighth level of detail down about how we ' re going to do this , but it ' s daylight and let ' s go for it. " // <> <> Securities Firms Expand // Banks , of course , are not alone in the push to open non-bank banks . Securities firms , eager to recapture some of the money they lost when banks were granted the right to offer federally insured money market funds , are also moving in . Prudential- Bache has a non-bank bank in Georgia , for example , and E. F. Hutton has one in Delaware. // The Fed ' s decision , however , alerted banks to the possibility that they , too , could play the same game. // Most banks acknowledge that non-bank banks are a gamble . Large commercial loans have traditionally formed the basis of bank profits . The Fed ' s decision to allow U.S. Trust to open a non-bank bank is being challenged in court . Furthermore , the definitions of the two components of banking - commercial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legal challenges. // <> <> Banks ' Plans Vague // And Congress seems increasingly likely to change the rules of the game before the current session ends . Accordingly , many banks ' plans are vague , and analysts say that some are moving chiefly to establish a legal right to set up these non-bank banks in case Congress slams the door. // " I think it ' s a wedge , a foot in the door , for true interstate banking , " said George M. Salem , a banking analyst for A. G. Becker Paribas . In the interim , he said , banks could get to know potential customers by offering limited banking services . If officers meet customers while discussing checking accounts and credit cards , he said , it is easier later on to persuade customers to use other services that may be offered by another subsidiary of the bank holding company. // Besides , said James J. McDermott , an analyst for Keefe , Bruyette &; Woods , expanding existing out-of- state offices by adding more services would appeal to most banks trying to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to expand across state lines has frightened the smaller local banks , which fear their best customers will be lured away and the concept of community loyalty will be destroyed . For example , John Shivers , president and chairman of the Southwest Bank in Fort Worth , does not want to see any more competition than he has now from large banks. // " They ' re trying to come in and skim off the cream of the business , " he said . " I think if they ' re going to call themslves banks , they ought to meet all the regulations we have to meet . Let ' s have the same set of rules for everyone if we ' re going to play in the same ball park. " // But not all bank holding companies want to play ball . The North Carolina- based Wachovia Corporation , which ranks 40th in the country , with $7. 5 billion in assets at the end of the first quarter , has not applied to open any non-bank banks . John G. Medlin Jr , the corporation ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ non-bank banks were worth the investment or the potential legal difficulties . " You have to look at it and say the odds are not very good that most of these banks will open , " he said. // Rather than establish a new venture and increase the number of competitors for financial dollars , Wachovia would prefer to buy an existing bank in another state and establish a regional banking network , Mr. Medlin said. // Several Southeastern states , most recently South Carolina , have passed laws that would allow out-of-state holding companies to buy banks in their states if banks in that state were given the same privilege. // " The banking business is a little like the airline business , " Mr. Medlin said . " You see a lot of 747 ' s flying around with a less than break-even load factor . We want to be in other states in time , but we prefer that route be what seems to be developing in regional reciprocal banking in the Southeast. " //              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
