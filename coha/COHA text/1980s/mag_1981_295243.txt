By the time Donald Steinberg was 28 , he and his Fort Lauderdale " company " owned waterfront homes and office buildings in Florida , apartments in Houston and a town house in New York City that was later sold for $2 million . With his partners , he maintained a fleet of three dozen or more boats-no one kept count-and a cash reserve so large they could shrug off million-dollar business losses . Eventually they had to buy their own turboprop airplane to ferry overflowing cash profits to uninquisitive banks in the Bahamas and Cayman Islands . <P> Steinberg and his partners made scant effort to hide their wealth . At restaurants they ordered $400 bottles of wine . At Steinberg 's $400,000 home were parked a Maserati , a Lamborghini , a Ferrari and the inevitable Rolls-Royce . One of Steinberg 's partners gave a Mercedes to a girl he barely knew . <P> Gradually they became sophisticates in international finance . For one deal , says Steinberg , they siphoned money through a yacht broker in Miami to a bank in the Caymans , thence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Steinberg dispatched cash and trusted aides to start a multimillion-dollar agricultural operation in Kenya . The crop : marijuana . <P> Steinberg and friends were South Florida drug dealers . Big ones . According to the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration , at Steinberg 's peak in 1978 his group imported one-sixth of all marijuana entering the country . Steinberg accepts the DEA 'S estimates of his business ( $100 million annual revenues on 500,000 Ibs. of marijuana ) but not his exalted rank . Says he : " There are hundreds of outfits like mine . Certainly there are scores . " <P> Like many other dealers , Steinberg started as a pot smoker in his home town ( Carpentersville , Ill. , pop . 23,000 ) , trying to finance his recreational use . The business seemed so easy that it just grew . Throughout their perilous escapades , Stein berg and friends remained calm , peaceful , fun-loving , devil-may-care . They never used force . If an aide was kidnaped , they paid the ransom . If a distributor burned them on a payoff , they simply did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wives , girlfriends were recruited to rent safe houses in Miami suburbs for storing drugs or to ride along as evidence of propriety when they were transporting a shipment . Says Steinberg : " I never saw a gun the whole time I was in the business . " <P> As the business grew they took precautions : changing telephone numbers frequently , talking in code , using electronic black boxes to conceal the locations from which they spoke . Yet at heart , the dealers remained kids who believed they would never be caught . The downhill slide started when Steinberg directed one operation from a Fort Lauderdale hotel room . Calls to his extension tied up the entire switchboard ; a suspicious owner called the police . The gang scrambled out the windows but left behind marijuana , 7 Ibs. of cocaine ( value : $180,000 ) and $1.2 million in cash , plus meticulous account books and records . It took police a year to trap Steinberg . <P> Then a technical error in their search warrant gave him time to win his release and flee . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
