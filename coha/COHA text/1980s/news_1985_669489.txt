To see why , take a hypothetical journey in time to October 1986. // Congress and President Reagan find they can not agree on how to shrink or eliminate enough programs to bring the projected budget deficit for fiscal year 1987 down to $144 billion. // So a large chunk of the federal budget is about to be run , like a roll of baloney , through the Gramm-Rudman meat slicer to produce the $50 billion in required trims. // // Gramm-Rudman is the law requiring the federal govermnent to have a balanced budget by fiscal year 1991 . If Congress and the White House can ' t agree on how to reach deficit targets , the law requires across-the-board spending cuts . Half must come from defense , the rest from domestic programs. // By fall 1986 , this whirling legislative blade could be taking slices from scores of federal programs . The potential effects of the cuts include : // // * Boosts in state and local taxes as jurisdictions try to make up for the loss of federal funds for highways , mass transit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ' I can guarantee you that the next two legislative sessions at the beginning of 1986 and 1987 will have record ( tax ) increases in most legislatures , ' ' says Stephen Silbiger , associate director of the American Federation of State , County , and Municipal Employees. // // * Slower growth in individual incomes as the economy cools due to the cutback in federal spending . The size of the economic slowdown will depend on how much and how fast the Federal Reserve loosens its hold on credit . At least one major economic consulting firm predicts trouble if Congress adheres to the current Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction timetable beyond the 1988 budget year. // When Data Resources Inc. plugged the Gramm-Rudman deficit targets into its computer model of the US economy , it found ' ' you can ' t get to 1991 by assuming the Gramm-Rudman schedule , ' ' says DRI vice-president Robert Gough . ' ' The problem is too much ( budget cutting ) , too quickly . Monetary policy can ' t handle it. ' ' // If the budget cuts continue on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a recession or the Fed has to crank up the printing press so much that inflation is rekindled , DRI says. // // * Hikes of at least 12 percent or comparable service cuts in a host of government programs including Amtrak , job training , Small Business Administration loans , and Coast Guard services for boaters . State and local user fees for highways and subways could also rise as federal funds dry up . Fees associated with student loans would rise by a fixed amount. // // * Reductions in interest rates as the federal government takes a smaller share of lendable funds . By 1991 the corporate bond rate would be 7. 5 percent , 1. 5 percentage points lower than it would be without Gramm-Rudman , says Chris P. Varvares , vice-president of Laurence H. Meyer and Associates , a St. Louis-based economic consulting firm . The anticipation of these lower rates and their positive effect on corporate profits has helped fuel the stock market ' s recent run-up. // Lower interest rates also would help the value of the dollar drop on foreign-exchange markets , thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fortunes of US companies that try to sell products overseas . Mr. Varvares ' s calculations show the trade deficit nearly disappearing by 1991 due to the budget cuts ' effects. // It is very difficult to predict the precise size of the changes Gramm-Rudman will bring in government services or the economy . The budget cuts required for fiscal year 1987 hinge on how much Congress trims spending in fiscal 1986 , which is already under way . There are some signs that Congress is holding back on FY ' 86 budget reductions , since Gramm-Rudman limits the required cuts this year to $11. 7 billion even if the 1986 deficit target of $171. 9 is not reached. // Huge chunks of the budget , including social security , interest on the national debt , and a variety of programs to aid low-income Americans , are completely shielded . Partial protection is offered to other popular programs , including medicare . As a result , thicker slices will have to be taken from the parts of budget that are unprotected. // Office of Management and Budget Director James Miller is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and is examining $430 billion worth of programs to find these savings . Under his estimate of what is cuttable ( which departs somewhat from Gramm-Rudman provisions ) , eligible programs would have to take an across-the-board cut of about 12 percent . However , Mr. Miller says he hopes to convince Congress to eliminate some programs so as to avoid Gramm-Rudman. // While the deli-slicer approach is relatively neat , it is only one outcome Gramm-Rudman may trigger , specialists say . Figuring out what Gramm-Rudman will do requires at least as many assumptions as there are members of Congress who think they should be president. // The first assumption is that the law is constitutional - an assumption not universally held . Rep. Mike Synar ( D ) of Oklahoma filed suit in federal court Dec. 12 challenging Gramm-Rudman ' s constitutionality. // Another assumption , by no means certain , is that Congress and the President will fail to come up with the needed budget cuts or a combination of budget cuts and tax increases . To avoid automatic cuts or a tax increase , 30 to 50 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone , Senate Finance Committee chairman Bob Packwood ( R ) of Oregon says . To meet the Gramm-Rudman target for 1987 , the Reagan administration ' s tentative ' 87 budget proposes a variety of drastic steps , including sale of the Federal Housing Administration. // Finally , projections of Gramm-Rudman ' s effects assume no congressional efforts to amend the law or no recession . If the economy shrinks for two consecutive quarters , the bill allows Congress to suspend the maximum deficit target for that fiscal year and the following one. // // // //
