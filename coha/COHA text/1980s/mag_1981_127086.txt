The Detroit Pistons are clinging to a 99-94 lead against the New Jersey Nets in the Silverdome with 3:30 to play . Isiah Thomas , loitering deep in a corner , grabs a loose ball that 's careering out of bounds and bounces it between his legs , while leaning over the end line and standing on one foot . He barely regains his balance when a Net player knocks him into the Detroit bench . Piston Coach Scotty Robertson asks anxiously , " Are you all right ? " A grin lights up Thomas ' face . " I 'm fine , Coach , how are you ? " // Scotty and the rest of the Pistons will be just fine if Thomas can continue his inspired play . Averaging 23 points , 5.6 assists and a score of smiles per game , he had led Detroit to a 3-2 record at week 's end . That kind of start would n't mean much in a lot of places , but for perennially deprived Detroit it 's hot stuff . There were victories over New Jersey and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Milwaukee and Chicago . By defeating those teams the Pistons won their first three games for the first time in 11 years ; last season they lost 12 before winning three . // The 20-year-old Thomas does n't quite reach the 6 ' 1 " listed in the program and , while he packs close to 180 pounds  --  playing weight for some heavy-hitting NFL defensive backs  --  he will never be mistaken for Lester Hayes . At first sight , in fact , there does n't appear to be much more to Thomas than his dominating grin , which starts with a pair of deeply set dimples and sneaks up each side of his face to his shining , almost sparkling eyes . The grin is omnipresent , even on the basketball court , no matter the situation , which has led one observer to comment , " Maybe he ca n't help it , like when a baby has gas . " // It 's impossible to say how many scouts and opponents have misjudged Thomas because of that exceptional grin or that unexceptional frame . You would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ High School in Westchester , Ill. , five miles from his home on Chicago 's West Side , his teams were 73-15 . At Indiana , Thomas , as a sophomore , contributed mightily to winning last spring 's NCAA championship , which in turn created just the " right " conditions for him to turn pro . // That " Angel with the Dirty Face " look is the reason why women , young and old , want to cuddle Thomas , who says he has " about 12 mothers . " It 's why Converse is paying him an estimated $100,000 to wear its shoes this year and , perhaps most important , why his Detroit teammates are n't jealous of his four-year , $1 million contract or the publicity that has already made him the second coming of Magic Johnson . Not that Thomas does n't eat it up . " All the great ones have a little bull in them , " Robertson says . " The other day he was standing around when the Lions walked by , going to practice in the Silverdome . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and behind his back . " // Stuff like that may have impressed the Lions , but it sure did n't impress Bobby Knight . When Indiana was struggling at 7-5 last December , Knight was none too pleased with Thomas ' freelance game . And , even though the Hoosiers went all the way , Knight was n't notably shaken when Thomas decided to cast his lot with the NBA. // Unquestionably Thomas  --  along with the Pistons ' other first-round pick in last June 's draft , Notre Dame 's Kelly Tripucka , who 's averaging 12.4 points a game  --  has given the Pistons a big lift . The club 's publicity people say " Piston Fever " is sweeping the town , but the at-first unconvinced fans , burned by 21 losing seasons in 24 years , were treating it like malaria . Chicago and New Jersey drew only a little more than 14,000 combined , but 15,035 showed for what turned out to be a 129-88 trouncing by world-champion Boston last Saturday , in which Thomas had 21 points . Tripucka , who  --  honest Injun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinks things are turning around . " Isiah and I are n't used to losing , " he says . " We 'd like to create an atmosphere here like we had in school . When we won our first game this year , I was jumping up and down and screaming , looking for someone 's hand to shake . But everyone kept on walking like it was just another game we won . " // Either they knew something Tripucka did n't or they were fearful it could n't last . A contender in the early ' 70s ( coaches Bill van Breda Kolff , Ray Scott and Herb Brown each had one winning season ) , the Detroit franchise fell on hard times because of a series of inept front-office decisions , the most recent being the trade of M.L. Carr and two No. 1 draft choices to Boston for Bob McAdoo in 1979 . McAdoo did n't pan out in Detroit and was waived last March 11 , while Carr has been an integral player for the Celtics . The Celtic draft choices became Kevin McHale and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Golden State , which took Joe Barry Carroll and Rickey Brown . // This year 's draft , however , is another matter . When the ball is in Isiah 's hands , all the other Pistons seem to become smarter . They know each cut to the basket represents a potential two points , so moving without the ball  --  not normally a high priority here  --  has become most desirable . At least that 's the way Piston General Manager Jack McCloskey sees it . " If a player does something especially well , the others pick up on it , " McCloskey says . " When I get into position , " says Forward John Long , the team 's leading scorer last season , " I know I 'm going to get the ball . I ca n't be double-teamed now like I was last year , and neither can Thomas , because he 'll dish it off to me . " Will Robinson , McCloskey 's administrative assistant , agrees . " I believe God made people to perform certain arts , " he says . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made to run and Isiah Thomas was made to play basketball . " // Despite that engaging grin , Thomas can play rough , elbowing and cheating for an edge . " Isiah is going to do whatever needs to be done to get the job done , " Robertson said after Thomas ' 31-point , 11-assist performance against Milwaukee on opening night . " I 'm not saying he 's going to out-jump Kareem , but Kareem 's gon na have to jump . " // But that 's one match-up Thomas admits he 's not ready for . " The only person I 've been surprised by has been Kareem , " says Thomas , who played against Abdul-Jabbar 's Lakers in the preseason . " Everyone calls him the dominant center , but he 's much better than that . The things he does , the plays he makes ... You look at him and you can tell he 's been taught very well . " // So was Thomas . Given his fascination with fundamentals , there was little doubt why he chose Indiana and its taskmaster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entire city of Chicago , including his mother , to stay at home and attend DePaul . Choosing Indiana may have been one of the few things he 's done exactly as he wanted to . // As Thomas relates that story in a Washington hotel room , there 's a knock on the door and he opens it to find a sportscaster and camera crew from a local station . Thomas begs off because of fatigue , but the sportscaster is insistent . They talk several minutes more before a compromise is reached : Thomas will see them a few hours later . Thomas is n't upset about the ambush , but rather because " that man is probably thinking I 'm a jerk for not talking to him . " Robertson says Thomas would like to be everything for everybody , and Thomas does n't disagree . // " He got that from me , " says his mother , Mary Thomas . " The minute someone looks at us with sad eyes , we 're over there trying to help . " Isiah 's father left the family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chicago Housing Authority worker , to raise nine children . The youngest , Isiah , has always been a favorite . " Even now I 'll wake up at midnight or one in the morning and give him a call , " Mary Thomas says . " I was kind of like his first coach . I 'd always talk to him and wherever I went , he went . We walked and talked many a day together when he was younger . He probably did n't understand what I was saying , but he looked up at me like he did . " // Thomas says he was n't a bad kid , " just hardheaded , " but before he could prove it on the streets , his brothers directed him to the local Boys ' Club . // " There were people who got shot and stabbed and all that stuff , but we enjoyed the West Side , " says Thomas . " I appreciate it even more now . Take something like shoes : You take care of them better because when you were young and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or two . Or three meals a day . I know everybody does n't get that . // " You ca n't take things for granted . I think about where I am and it 's awesome , it 's crazy . One day you 're not able to get anything and the next day you can have whatever you want . " // Except respite from the rigors of the NBA life-style . " People have no idea how difficult it is playing in the league , how tiring the travel can be , " he said before last Friday 's game with the Bullets , in which he found out firsthand : John Lucas blew past a fatigued Thomas for a couple of easy buckets . Late in the game Thomas was fouled while shooting and went to the line for a pair of important free throws . Up for the first , Thomas toed the line , took a deep breath , bent his knees  --  and shot an airball . Later , he would say , " My mind said yes but my legs said no . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the biggest smile in the Capital Centre belonged to Isiah Thomas .
