Strip flooring consists of narrow tongue-and-groove floorboards usually less than three and a half inches wide . The best time to make repairs is in the winter , when low humidity widens existing gaps between boards , making sections easier to remove . If the flooring has been treated with a clear finish , it may be necessary to tint the patches carefully or to refinish the entire floor to hide the repair. // Do not start the job until you are sure you can obtain replacement floorboards that duplicate the ones to be repaired . Sources to check are lumberyards , flooring suppliers and salvage dealers . You will probably need to take a sample of the flooring with you to make a suitable match . If you can find a spare scrap , so much the better . If not , remove a sample from the damaged area or from an obscure area like a closet floor , following the instructions below carefully. // The first step in patching strip flooring is to mark each damaged board , using a carpenter ' s square or a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the board and at least an inch beyond the area to be replaced . If sections of several adjoining boards must be patched , stagger the lines , so that the cut ends will be at least six inches apart . This will make repair less visible . If no subfloor is present , sections must be cut so their ends lie over the centers of the joists supporting them. // There are two ways of handling the next step , depending on whether you feel more comfortable with a chisel or with an electric drill . If you choose the chisel , use a sharp one-inch-wide butt chisel and a hammer , following the marked lines. // The second method , with a drill , will save time , particularly when working with thick flooring . Drill a row of large holes across each end of the damaged section ; the outer edges of the holes should touch the marked lines. // Use a spade bit and , if you like , a vertical drilling guide . Afterward , square the ends of the drilled board with a chisel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this method , be careful not to damage the subflooring or joists. // Whether chiseling through the entire board or merely removing the wood left after drilling , this is the technique to use : first , hold the chisel so its beveled side faces the section of flooring to be removed . Strike the chisel with the hammer so the blade penetrates about a quarter of an inch of wood . Next , move the chisel so the edge of the blade is parallel to the marked line and about half an inch away . Hold the tool at a 45-degree angle with the beveled side of the blade up . Strike the chisel to remove a wedge-shaped chunk of waste . Be careful not to drive the chisel past the vertical cut . Most strip flooring is three-quarters of an inch thick , so this procedure will have to be repeated several times. // Finally , chisel two lengthwise vertical cuts along each section of the damaged floorboard so that the wood can be removed in three strips . With a flat pry bar , lift the middle strip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the floorboard and then the one containing the tongued side. // Work from the center of each strip toward the ends . When you are finished , remove any protruding nails or , using a nail set , drive them below the surface of the subfloor or joists. // Next , to remove any other damaged boards , repeat the procedures outlined above , chiseling or drilling the ends . It is usually possible to pry out the damaged boards without splitting them. // Saw lengths of replacement floorboards to fit the spaces exactly . If hand-sawing , use a miter box to make sure the ends of the patches are square . Also , cut a piece of flooring about six inches long to use as a hammering block. // To install the first patch , place it so its grooved side fits over the tongue of the existing floorboard next to it . Slide the grooved side of the hammering block over the tongue of the patch , and gently tap the patch into place with a hammer. // Use washers , cardboard or coins as spacers between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ create a gap the same width as those between other floorboards . Then fasten the patch to the subflooring or joist with two-and-a-half-inch-long cement-coated finishing nails or spiral-shank flooring nails . Remove the spacers when this step is completed. // Drilling pilot holes for the nails is recommended to prevent splitting but is not always necessary . Use a bit whose diameter is slightly smaller than that of the nail. // Starting in the middle of the board , space the nails along the length of the tongue side at 8- to 10-inch intervals . If the patch is less than a foot long , four nails , two at each end as described below , will hold it . Install the nails along the upper corner of the tongue , and aim them in toward the center of the board at about a 45-degree angle so they pass through the board before entering the subfloor or joist . Use a nail set to drive the heads below the surface. // For a patch consisting of a single board or for the last board in a larger patch , carefully remove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leave the top part of the groove so there is no unsightly gap visible from above . Then tap the piece gently into place. // To fasten such pieces and to prevent them from warping , drill pairs of pilot holes at a 45-degree angle half an inch from the ends and edges . Follow this same procedure for short patches and for the ends of the undamaged floorboards that were cut when making the patch . Install nails , sink their heads and then fill all the nail holes with wood putty tinted to match the color of the floor. //
