When Gannett President John Curley wanted to alert Chairman Allen Neuharth that their five-year-old national newspaper ( circ. 1.5 million ) had broken into the black , the telegram was as short and peppy as any USA Today headline : MCPAPER HAS MADE IT . Thanks mainly to a 45% increase in ad revenues over last year , USA Today converted a nearly $900,000 loss in April to a $1.09 million profit in May . That was a pittance compared with the losses of nearly $400 million that Gannett is reported to have suffered since USA Today hit the newsstands in September 1982 , but the first earnings were a heartening victory for a paper that once was given little chance for survival . <P> At first USA Today was scorned for its short , punchy articles . Critics dubbed it " McPaper , " the journalistic equivalent of fast food , but soon major papers began imitating USA Today 's artful use of color and snazzy graphics .                    @
