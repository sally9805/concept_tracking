Most of the steelmaking facilities at Chicago ' s 102-year-old South Works complex will be shut , as will the Cuyahoga Works in Cleveland , a wire plant in Trenton and a specialty steel products plant in Johnstown , Pa. // The closings will reduce the Pittsburgh-based company ' s steelmaking capacity by 16 percent , accelerating the shrinkage of the nation ' s major steelmakers in the face of competition from low-priced imports and the small nonunion producers that have developed in the last decade. // The closings , which will be effective next April , followed weeks of efforts by the company to extract concessions from the workers that would make the plants more competitive . The company ' s decision will intensify the economic hardship of the steelworkers and the steel communities and is another in a long list of problems for the United Steelworkers of America . ( Page D4. ) // To account for the closings on its balance sheet , the company will take a $650 million after-tax charge against fourth-quarter earnings , the first major write-off since 1979 , when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reflects the reduction in assets represented by the closings , as well as pension payments and other related costs. // Analysts estimated the charge could bring the company ' s loss for the full year to $900 million , against $361 million for 1982. // At a news conference here , David M. Roderick , the company ' s chairman and chief executive officer , also announced the failure of U.S. Steel ' s negotiations with the British Steel Corporation . The plan had been for U.S. Steel to buy slab from British Steel to finish at its mill in Fairless , Pa. , which British Steel was to help modernize. // The proposal was seen as a bold attempt to keep the mill running . But , coming even as U.S. Steel was aggressively protesting low-cost subsidized imports , it had drawn strong opposition from the union and in Congress. // Mr. Roderick would not explain the deal ' s collapse , but analysts said it had snagged on the demand that the British company pay to rehabilitate the American mill . Mr. Roderick said that the company continued to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as well as exploring such purchases with other countries. // David Healy , an analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. , questioned whether the antiquated Fairless Mill could survive without the infusion from British Steel. // Many of the facilities to be shut date from the turn of the century , even preceding the formation of the corporation itself . The steel from these mills , which were manned by European immigrants and more recently blacks and Mexicans , was used to construct the foundations of industrial America. // <> <> Rail Mill Plan Abandoned // The South Works , which once employed 18 , 000 , will be reduced to two electric furnaces and a small finishing mill that makes light structural beams . Earlier the company had said it would build a $200 million rail mill there in exchange for contract concessions . But today Mr. Roderick said that plan had been abandoned , despite some concessions from the union and promised aid from the Government. // The company also announced the closing of a pipe mill at its National Works in McKeesport , Pa. , steelmaking facilities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a beam mill in Clairton , Pa . The company will also shut down an old rail mill and a few other finishing mills at its plant in Gary , Ind. // Of the affected workers , 10 , 840 are already on temporary layoffs . A spokesman for the company said it was discussing with the affected communities what to do with the sites of the closed plants. // <> <> Market Reaction Positive // The announcement came a year to the day after the Bethlehem Steel Corporation announced that it would close most of its large plants in Lackawanna , N.Y. , and in Johnstown . Analysts said that the company made the announcement before year-end to try to put the problems of one of the worst years ever for the steel industry behind it . Investors reacted positively ; on the New York Stock Exchange the stock closed at 29 7/8 , up 5/8. // At the same time yesterday , reflecting the company ' s new emphasis on its most competitive products , U.S. Steel announced that it would reopen its steelmaking operations at its mill in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pipe , creating 1 , 600 jobs , and that the company ' s board had approved a plan to build new continuous casters at two mills. // U.S. Steel is thus positioned to concentrate on flat-rolled sheets , used by the auto industry ; steel plate , used in heavy machinery , and pipe , used in oil and gas drilling . Though these products face pressure from imports , they are less vulnerable to competition from the small , nonunion mini- mills than bar and wire , which U.S. Steel is largely abandoning . Bar is used to reinforce concrete ; wire is used in heavy cable. // <> <> A Focus on Modernization // Robert Crandall , an economist at the Brookings Institution , called the new strategy " a good thing . " He explained that the producers " are trying now to focus on modernizing only those plants where the investment makes economic sense.

He refused to say if this would be the last of them. // " You can never say it ' s the end of shutdowns , " he said . " You always have to keep your facilities competitive. " // Today ' s announcements are part of an industrywide attempt to reduce break-even rates , and Mr. Roderick said the reductions yesterday will cut that rate by 10 percent for the company . Analysts said that the steelmaker , which is now operating at slightly more than 50 percent of capacity , will have 60 percent as its new break-even rate. // Mr. Roderick said the closings would reduce the company ' s costs by between $180 million and $200 million a year. //
