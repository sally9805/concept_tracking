Assassination was impossible . John Kennedy , with Jackie beside him in her raspberry pink suit , was too young , too exuberant to fall . The Secret Service , snooping beneath manhole covers , scanning for hostile eyes , was invincible . There would be no darkness on this bright day in Dallas . <P> How fragile our myths , how fleeting certainty . <P> Perhaps we knew when the first sound reached the press bus behind Kennedy 's limousine . A distant crack , another . A pause , and another crack . Something was dangerously off-key . <P> Bob Pierpoint of CBS stood up , and our eyes met for ever so tiny an instant . We knew but did not want to believe . " What was that ? " he asked . Doug Kiker , now of NBC , then a reporter for the New York Herald Tribune , was typing on his lap . He paused . Kennedy 's limousine had turned the corner beneath a boxy , ugly building and sunk out of sight . The pigeons  --  the famous pigeons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> Pierpoint stood still for a couple more seconds , Kiker pecked a time or two . Three seconds , four . Then reality rushed with terrifying clarity down that short street beneath the Texas School Book Depository . We were never the same , nor was the world . <P> The story at the core was the stuff of everyday American violence . A killer and a city street and a wild ride to an emergency room and a young body too broken to repair . But it was Camelot and this was John Kennedy , and television now rushed in to make the dreadful event an epic . <P> Madness descended . Motorcycle cops jumped curbs , machines roaring over the grass in a ballet of aimless panic . The crowd on the grassy knoll looked like it had been swept with a giant scythe . The street was empty , a stark , lifeless slab of concrete that smelled of disaster . Kennedy 's motorcade had been chopped in two like a luckless centipede , the front end blown to God knew where , the rear end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Parkland Hospital . A grim young man was washing away the blood and flesh that had splattered the leather upholstery . The sight was shattering . The red roses given to Jackie were still in the car  --  crushed , broken . The young man in his neat dark suit , sleeves pushed up , swabbed the seats . They glistened in their miserable wetness . Beside the car was a bucket with brownish red water . If any doubt remained about this calamity , it was swept away in one glance at that bucket . So simple , so hideous . <P> The nurses ' classroom at Parkland became a vortex of the world 's clamor for information . Each word from that tiny point of a suburban hospital was flung across continents . <P> Two priests left the hospital , silent , sagging . Their duty was plainly over , whatever it had been . Asked if Kennedy was dead or alive , they remained silent for a few seconds . Then one of them blurted the terrible truth : " He 's dead , all right . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then exploded around the world .
