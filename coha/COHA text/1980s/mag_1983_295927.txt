VERY MUCH A LADY by Shana Alexander Little , Brown ; 316 pages ; $17.50 <P> Three years after Jean Harris fired four bullets into Herman Tarnower , the case of the headmistress and the diet doctor still has the power to engage our imagination . The public 's appetite for details of the murder trial had been whetted by the social standing of the protagonists , as Diana Trilling pointed out in her brilliant 1981 study , Mrs. Harris . But the abiding fascination of the case resides in the story of the high-minded , stylish lady who descended to the depths of self-abasement and violence . <P> Although outdistanced by Trilling 's earlier effort , Journalist Shana Alexander has lavished her considerable reportorial skills on Very Much a Lady , interviewing hundreds of people who knew the doctor and his lover . Alexander has emerged with a portrait of Harris ' selfish , hardhearted , authoritarian father that goes far to explain her longstanding tolerance of Tarnower 's ill-treatment . The author acknowledges a sense of identification with Harris ( " she reminds me of me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from leading the reader through every squalid stage of Harris ' 14-year affair with Tarnower . The Scarsdale physician , the son of humble Jewish immigrants , was a relentless social climber , impressed by the gracious airs and cultivated ways of the classy , Waspish headmistress . Soon , however , he reneged on his proposal to marry her and embarked on a series of affairs . All the while , he kept Harris on the leash she handed him . <P> As Harris vied with her principal rival , Lynne Tryforos , for pride of place in the Tarnower household , there were some nasty incidents . Harris received mysterious , obscene phone calls . She telephoned Tryforos every night for a month . The women alternated in sharing Tarnower 's bed and left their belongings in his bathroom . Harris repeatedly tossed out Tryforos ' curlers . A favorite dress of Harris ' was found smeared with excrement . Harris whined and wheedled as her feelings fluctuated between jealous rage and obsessive dependence . By the time she entered the doctor 's bedroom for the last time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the other , she had truly descended into what Yeats called " the foul rag-and-bone shop of the heart . " <P> Alexander 's most provocative discovery concerns Harris ' mental state . She was diagnosed as psychotic after the killing , but her condition had long been aggravated by large daily doses of Desoxyn . Tarnower had prescribed the amphetamine for her even though the manufacturer warns against its long-term use because of the risk of psychosis . <P> Alexander argues persuasively that the failure of Harris ' lawyer , Joel Aurnau , to plead " extreme emotional disturbance " was one in a series of wrong decisions that resulted in a hopeless case for the defense . Aurnau declared that he would settle for nothing but acquittal on the ground that the killing had been a " tragic accident . " The jury remained unconvinced .
