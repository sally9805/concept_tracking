Miners'fury brings anguish <P> As the bloody confrontation between militants of the 180,000-member National Union of Mineworkers and the state-owned National Coal Board entered its 36th week , the most disruptive labor unrest the country has witnessed since the General Strike of 1926 was no longer just a power struggle between miners and mine managers over the issue of unproductive collieries . Instead , with economic losses mounting and with television providing scenes of charging mounted police and rock-throwing strikers , the dispute had become a national trauma . <P> Although some of the most dramatic fighting yet between strikers and police broke out last week around mines in Yorkshire , Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher remained uncompromising . Addressing the Lord Mayor of London 's annual banquet , she declared , " This challenge will not succeed . The government will hold firm . " The Catholic bishops of England and Wales , however , were sympathetic to the miners in their first statement on the strike . N.U.M. President Arthur Scargill , speaking in the southern Wales town of Aberavon , was cheered wildly by an audience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line . " I am not prepared to condemn the actions of my members whose only crime is fighting for the right to work , " said Scargill . At the same meeting , the Trades Union Congress 's new general secretary , Norman Willis , bravely decried " the brick , the bolt or the petrol bomb " as weapons detrimental to the miners ' cause . He was jeered with savage shouts of " Off ! Off ! Off ! " <P> To most observers of the long-running strike , the psychological advantage appeared to be tilting toward the coal board . One reason was the disclosure late last month that the N.U.M. had sought financial assistance from , of all sources , Libyan Leader Muammar Gaddafi . Last week in London , Scargill unabashedly made a similar appeal for assistance at the Soviet embassy . TASS said that Soviet miners have contributed half a million pounds to the British miners ' union . The strike was also weakened by last month 's decision of the smaller mine safety supervisors ' union not to join the N.U.M. walkout . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 174 coal mines would have been shut down , including those that have been operating during the strike . <P> Meanwhile , the coal board has reminded strikers of the prospects of up to $1,764 in wages and back holiday pay by Christmas for miners who return to work by the beginning of this week . For striking miners who have lost an average $7,500 each , the reminder was a shrewd ploy . In contrast to the 200 miners a week who had been returning to their pits by late October , more than 7,000 men have returned over the past two weeks . <P> To date the conflict has cost 60 million tons in lost coal production . And with some 125,000 miners still out , the strike is far from over . In Yorkshire last week , strikers overturned and wrecked automobiles , hurled gasoline bombs at a police car and a police station for the first time . Thirty-five policemen were injured and 45 strikers arrested .
