MOTHER I 'm afraid some bones got stuck . Last week . Rather large game fowl . ( Five of JOAN 'S friends enter . The MAN continues plunging . ) MARTA Guess who lucked out and got Jimmy ? SUSAN Jimmy the Door ! KATE Losin ' Susan here . SUSAN It 's on account of I can cha cha . ( They laugh . ) BERTHA I got Jewel Rude Dude . He 's such an elegant dresser . GRISELDA Very neat .

The MOTHER suddenly stops plunging . JOAN I thought that guy fixed the sink . MOTHER He did . For a while . It 's the thing in there that that grinds stuff up . It 's strange . JOAN At least most of the wreckage is gone from the street . MOTHER How was practice ? JOAN Nifty . Anyone call ? MOTHER Nope . No one ever calls anymore . ( Pause . ) Why is it so dark out today ? JOAN That time of year , Mom . Honestly ( Pause . ) Mom , why do n't you ever talk about it ? MOTHER About what ? JOAN You know . Dad . All that stuff . ( Her MOTHER goes back to the plunger . ) I know we 're not fashionable . Okay , Mom , but . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk .

Pause. ) p. 13 MOTHER I would like just once to do something original . Just once is all I ask . Even if we 're not fashionable anymore . JOAN Mom , do n't talk like that . MOTHER Maybe go back to school . Earn valuable career credits . An exciting career in robotics may await me . JOAN Mom , please talk to me . MOTHER That nice man who fixed the drainpipe was a Trotskyist like your father . It makes me nervous JOAN Mom , I do n't care if we 're not fashionable . I love you . ( Pause . Her MOTHER sits . ) MOTHER Well . All right . We were in New York for the party congress . We had just met the Mayor of Cleveland . Of course he was n't a Trotskyist . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man he was , with a fine , big , round head . He said to your father : " Fine work . That report on solid waste . " Then he introduced himself to me . It was an awkward moment because , of course , your father had no idea what the mayor was talking about . It seems he was at the wrong hotel . " We 're Trotskyists . " We said . " My apologies . " He said . " May I buy you a drink ? " And he did . One of those elegant little sidewalk cafs . Lovely . ( A sad moment . ) We were sitting on the sidewalk . Or , rather , at a table on the sidewalk . And your father leaned over to make a point and spilled his espresso . As he moved forward with the saucer in his other hand the heel snapped off his shoe and well he slid back into the chair . Of course the coffee got over everyone . And the chair leg broke and , it was quite remarkable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ backflip into the street . I shall never forget the sight of his shoes , the soles of them , as they lifted high into the air . He was trying to save the cup , poor dear . But it shattered in the street , and then the first car ran over it . And the saucer which had been undamaged miraculously up to that point . He was a quite fastidious man . The second car ran over your father . Quite a large car . A limo , I think . " My word . " Said the mayor . What a strange thing to say . Of course he was dead . Your father , I mean . That 's about it . More coffee . p. 14 JOAN At least now I know . The truth . MOTHER Yes . That 's the least of it . Now you know . ( She goes back to the plunger . The phone rings . JOAN gets it . ) Panda Hands . JOAN Oh . Hi . Sure . I guess . ( She grimaces to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dream . Dressed in red as a Trotskyist Anti-pope . LOSIN ' SUSAN , a blue Anti-pope , lies in an open coffin . The others are , respectively : MARTA , black ; GRISELDA , white ; BERTHA , green ; KATE , yellow . BARFLY is JOAN 'S Swiss Guard . He carries a halberd . JOAN Are we prepared , Barfly ? MISTER BARFLY Yes , excellency . JOAN Bring them in . MISTER BARFLY Singly . Or together ? Excellency ? JOAN En masse . We might as well deal with them all at once . ( BARFLY goes . Returns with the others . They arrange themselves about the room . Pause . ) Bertha , you look well . MARTA No need for small talk , Joan . KATE What are the conditions you propose ? JOAN Ah , Griselda , I hear you are fully recovered . GRISELDA Tolerably . BERTHA What is to be the final disposition of the Matriarchate of Cordoba ? Merged with Cadiz ? JOAN Not quite . KATE And Tunis , Carthago , Malta ? p. 16 JOAN That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decision ! It is not apparent from my information that your decision to summon this conclave , this silence of Anti-popes , has been informed to the minutest degree by a regard for my opinion . MARTA Be still , Kate . GRISELDA Hibernia ? What of Hibernia ? BERTHA Macedonia . The Sanjak of Novi Bazaar ? MARTA And what of the Eastern Matriarchates ? We who provide a buffer between you all and the Turks ? Have you considered the possible consequences ? JOAN Of course , Marta . Of course . MARTA Now that Diotima has passed on JOAN You are referring to Losin ' Susan ( Who sits up in her coffin . ) SUSAN I do n't want to move to Albuquerque . ( Lies down . ) KATE That is n't Latin . Is it Ladino ? BERTHA Be still , dear . JOAN I have called this silence of Anti-popes because there is a traitor in our midst . p. 17 BERTHA Explain yourself . JOAN If you allow* me . MARTA Preposterous . GRISELDA Let Joan speak . ( Pause . ) There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bush is tiresome . JOAN I suspect one of you of fomenting an antireformation . KATE No ! BERTHA Impossible . GRISELDA How can this be ? JOAN It is true . These ( She shows the document. ) are a set of 496 antitheses concerning our canons of heteroclite unorthodoxy . Found nailed to the door by one of my Swiss Guards , Jimmy . Some one of you has sought a codification of the undreamed of , the unspoken , and the unthinkable . It is signed with a crow 's feather . Thus . MARTA It 's a hoax . KATE Yes . Joan , it must be ? ( Weeps . ) GRISELDA Griselda , please . KATE No , you 're Griselda . I 'm Kate . GRISELDA Sorry . p. 18 BERTHA So emotional MARTA I do n't trust you , Joan . Are you accusing one of us , and if so , which ? If you have charges , present them . I have my Nuncios and Legates with me . In the antechamber JOAN That will not be necessary , Marta . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is a trap . JOAN Be quiet . ( Pause . ) In at least 98 of the aforementioned 496 antitheses there is incontrovertible evidence of the Mirandan heresy . ( Gasps . ) KATE Impossible . GRISELDA That was stamped out centuries ago . KATE How can you be so sure ? JOAN There are numerous quotations in the demotic script of whispertalk , the Mirandan cipher . BERTHA If that is true , then perhaps you are the author of these documents . You are , after all , the world 's leading expert on whispertalk GRISELDA Be still , let her speak . JOAN I can not tell who it is . MARTA Of course not . p. 19 JOAN Therefore I have taken steps , with sadness , but also with a firm sense of determination and duty , to abolish all of your matriarchates . From now on there is only one Anti-pope , and I am she . ( BARFLY bars door . ) MARTA I knew it . GRISELDA But Joan , how can you be capable of this ? MARTA Damn you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silence . I was foolish ever to trust a Trotskyist Anti-pope . My fastness at Antioch could have held out forever against her rhinodraconopeds . KATE Will you ransom us ? BERTHA Sorry , Joan . A legion of my best fusiliers are deployed in the Great Hall , just beyond those doors . If I blow on this Anti-papal secret clerical dog whistle they will rush to our defense . JOAN Two legions of my Swiss Guard surround the palace grounds , Bertha . You have no choice but to renounce your powers and accept me as the supreme Anti-pontiff . ( Pause . ) You see , Bertha , all your fusiliers are dead . BERTHA I do n't believe you . ( JOAN snaps her fingers . BARFLY opens the doors to the Great Hall . JOAN points down the corridor. ) p. 20 BERTHA I still do n't believe you . JOAN You are aware , I presume , of the symptoms of ergotic poisoning ? ( All look down the corridor and gasp . ) MARTA Demon . JOAN Twitching and quaking . SUSAN ( Sitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to move to Albuquerque . KATE Be quiet , fool . Your character would never say that . ( SUSAN lies down . ) JOAN Diotima here was the guardian of the Glassy Sphere . With her voices at my command I do not need your approval . My word is law . Whichever one of you is the Mirandan agent I do n't know . It hardly matters . The ransom will be a million obuluses . Each . GRISELDA Each ? KATE Each ! But that 's absurd . MARTA You 'll never get away with this , Joan . JOAN Except for you , Marta . You will remain here till the next intersection of the Seven Cosmic Circles . Then Diotima 's disembodied voice will tell us who is behind all this heretical whispertalk . It may be a long time . KATE But we trusted you , Joan . BERTHA I never trusted her . MARTA Oh , what a fool I am . Blackout. @x Scene six . The next day . The kitchen again . MOTHER at the table intently reading a college catalogue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prom 's tomorrow .

MOTHER How was cheerleader practice today ? JOAN Fine . Learned some new tricks . ( Pause . ) Only . Mom . MOTHER Yes , dear . JOAN I had a kind of bad dream last night . MOTHER I should n't have told you . So explicitly . JOAN No , it was n't about Dad . It was something else . p. 22 MOTHER The sink is fixed again . There 's fresh coffee . JOAN It was all kinda confused . All about Pope Joan and stuff . MOTHER I have to mend your dress for the prom . Why do n't you try it on ? ( She goes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Mr. Delaplane said you know a lot about astronomy but that nobody knows the orbital eccentricity of Triton . It 's too far away . MOTHER I knew it . I should never have told you the details . About your father 's death . JOAN Was it ever fashionable to be a Trotskyist ? MOTHER Yes , dear . Once it was very fashionable . ( She enters in a bright red prom dress . Her MOTHER sets about mending a hem . Pause . ) JOAN How come you know so much about astronomy ? MOTHER And we were personal acquaintances of the mayor . If things had only worked out a little differently . We might still be fashionable . JOAN Mom , would you tell me something ? MOTHER Our kitchen sink might not have been stopped up . Our front porch might not have fallen into the street . Poor dear , you know they have n't tccmbbd the body yet . p. 23 JOAN What ? What did you say ? MOTHER Slip of the tongue . They have n't identified his body yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man ? Again ? MOTHER What man ? JOAN The man that fixed the sink . MOTHER Once . Briefly . But it wo n't happen again . ( Pause . MOTHER finishes her mending . ) JOAN Did you sleep with him ? MOTHER What do you want from me ? Do I tell you how to live your life ? No , damn it . Is that how they teach you to think at that fancy Catholic school ? Just because we 're Trotskyists and you feel socially embarrassed . Just because we were once fashionable but are n't anymore . Just because I want so desperately , once in my life , to do something , anything , original JOAN Okay . Okay . Just curious . ( Pause . ) MOTHER He 's had an accident . Very serious one . He wo n't be back . ( Pause . ) JOAN Mother , who are you ? MOTHER Another cup of coffee ? p. 24 JOAN Really . ( Pause . ) MOTHER Since you ask .

You want to look inside things , but the insides of most things are the same . One , two . On , off . Boy , girl . Cat , dog . All the same and very boring . Pleasure is on the surface . Pleasure is not boring . On my world people go mad from excessive happiness , which you would never understand . Nor would you ever understand what a Fsqqtu is , which is why I am not going to explain . When the screws from the big bank come to close this circus down they 'll show fire and say : " we 've come .
