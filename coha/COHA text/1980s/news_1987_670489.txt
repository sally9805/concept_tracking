" He could hardly have done better , from a symbolic point of view , which is what counts most right now , " a prominent Capitol Hill Democrat said of Mr. Reagan . " This starts his comeback - but only starts it . We will see next week , when the President makes his speech , whether he is ready to take step two , which is to assimilate and react to the rather tough message sent to him by the Tower Commission. " // Politicians of both parties cautioned that much remained to be done before the Reagan Presidency could be considered out of trouble . Former Senator Paul Laxalt of Nevada , one of the President ' s closest friends , himself a candidate for the chief of staff ' s job , warned that Mr. Reagan , for the first time in his career , would have to learn to be much more of a " hands-on manager " and less of a delegator. // Whatever happens inside the White House , moreover , events outside will have a major impact on its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Iran-contra affair by select committees of the Senate and the House of Representatives and by the special prosecutor , Lawrence E. Walsh . All are expected to pursue leads developed but not fully explored by the President ' s special board , which was headed by former Senator John G. Tower of Texas and issued its report Thursday. // The selection of Mr. Baker had a number of political virtues , not least that of surprise . Because he had recently rebuffed White House feelers about replacing William J. Casey as Director of Central Intelligence , his name had been absent from the lists of potential successors to Mr. Regan , so his choice had an extra bit of drama. // Whether the President shrewdly calculated that the Baker appointment would create excitement , or whether he turned to the Tennessee moderate only because Mr. Laxalt and Drew Lewis , the former Transportation Secretary , were reluctant to take the job , the effect was essentially the same . <> <> Questioner of Nixon // Mr. Baker also has a special reputation for probity , which will be of no small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grew out of his willingness , as a senior Republican , to indulge in tough interrogations of officials of a Republican White House during the Watergate scandal , and it was symbolized by his constantly repeated question , " What did the President know and when did he know it ? " // In addition , Mr. Baker brings with him close friendships in both parties in Congress . Senator Bob Dole of Kansas , the Republican minority leader , said he had told Mr. Reagan that that was a key prerequisite for the job . One of the persistent criticisms of Mr. Regan has been his abrasive relationship with Capitol Hill. // " We have to do better , " Mr. Dole said . " It ' s not over yet. " // On the other hand , some old friends of Mr. Baker pointedly questioned his suitability for a staff job . A Tennessee colleague described him as " basically a policy man - best when confronting two or three big issues on a daily basis - and not someone whose strength has ever been managing the flow of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A Loyalist ' // " Howard isn ' t driven , " another friend said . " He gave the 10 or 12 hours a day the job needs when he was the leader in the Senate , but it was hard on him , and he couldn ' t wait to get out of there . Frankly , I ' m stunned that he would take on 14 hours a day , seven days a week. " // Several key Republicans suggested that Mr. Baker would work through two longtime aides - James Cannon , who once worked for Nelson A. Rockefeller in Albany and Washington , and later headed the Domestic Council under President Ford , and Thomas C. Griscom , who worked for Mr. Baker on Capitol Hill and headed the National Republican Senatorial Committee until last December. // Mr. Baker has never been considered a " conviction politician " in the Reagan mold , but one of the President ' s oldest friends said this morning , before the appointment was announced , that Mr. Reagan considered Mr. Baker " a loyalist who worked for a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he didn ' t particularly like. " // " He ' s also the kind of man , " the friend said , " who ' s never been afraid to tell the President when he ' s wrong , and if the Tower report says anything , it says that Ronald Reagan needs that kind of help. " // In turning to someone outside his own wing of his party , Mr. Reagan is emulating , consciously or unconsciously , the action of Richard M. Nixon during Watergate. // When John W. Dean 3d , then the White House counsel , and Richard G. Kleindienst , then the Attorney General , were forced to resign , Mr. Nixon chose two Republican liberals to replace them , Leonard Garment as counsel and Elliot L. Richardson as Attorney General , in an effort to demonstrate his openness to change. // Mr. Garment is now the attorney for one of the key figures in the Iran-contra controversy , Robert C. McFarlane , the former national security adviser . Mr. Richardson has retired from public life. // One way in which Mr. Baker may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for foreign policy . A longtime member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , he has been a determined though even-handed advocate of closer relations with the Soviet Union . He would be expected to involve himself far more closely in such questions than has Mr. Regan , whose background is domestic and economic. // The widespread assumption here tonight was that Mr. Baker ' s plan to seek the 1988 Republican Presidential nomination would now be set aside , though not necessarily abandoned . His organizational efforts were just beginning , and so far he had not cast a long shadow in the race , though some had seen him as a potential compromise figure if Mr. Dole and Vice President Bush eventually became deadlocked. // It is difficult to see how Mr. Baker could now mount an active campaign , with the first primaries less than a year away , and still discharge his White House duties . But the chief of staff ' s job can generate broad personal publicity , and Mr. Baker might still be able to make a late entry if no clear favorite emerges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
