The newspaper said the new contracts would cut its costs by $50 million a year , the minimum it said it had to have to offset anticipated losses this year and next. // The savings will come from the elimination of the equivalent of 1 , 340 jobs , a quarter of the newspaper ' s work force . Virtually all of the full-time employees who have begun leaving and will continue to leave for several months will get severance bonuses of $30 , 000 or more - a one-time cost to The News of nearly $50 million . <> <> A Dramatic Reversal // The total number of people to be put out of work was not disclosed , but it will be substantially less than 1 , 340 , because most of the shifts being eliminated were held by regular employees working overtime or by part-timers. // The agreements mark a dramatic reversal in the outlook for The News , a 73-year-old morning tabloid described by Mayor Koch as " the quintessential New Yorker . " Last winter , after the failure of its afternoon edition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its owner , the Tribune Company of Chicago , amid wide speculation that it would be closed if no buyer was found. // The accord was also a departure from a history of hostility dating back to the mid-1960 ' s , when unions and newspaper managers blamed each other for the deaths of four major dailies. // James G. Wieghart , the editor of The News , the nation ' s largest selling general-interest daily , said he did not envision any dramatic change of news focus in the coming months . He said his staff of 433 reporters , photographers , editors and support personnel - down 200 from a year ago - would continue to work on the borough-by-borough coverage that has been one of the paper ' s specialties , while trying to expand the space for arts , entertainment and business news. // One area of potential change is the price of the newspaper , now 25 cents on weekdays . On Aug. 2 The New York Post raised its price to 30 cents , matching the weekday price of The New York Times , without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The News said they were considering a matching increase. // Gregory L. Thornton , the News vice president who headed the bargaining efforts , which ended at 4 A.M. with an agreement with delivery truck drivers , said he was " very pleased " with the settlements . Officials of The News declined further comment , saying they did not want to jeopardize the ratification vote the drivers union has scheduled for Monday. // In coming to terms with its unions , The News apparently made little headway in basic manning or wage areas that would benefit the two other major New York City dailies . The Times and The Post had no comment yesterday on the settlements. // No details were available on what the drivers had agreed to . They had been asked to give up 70 jobs , in part by consolidating routes and allowing wholesalers to take over deliveries in some suburban areas. // Members of another union , the pressmen , are to vote Sunday on a contract agreement that The News and their leaders approved a week ago but that was not announced until yesterday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the pressmen ' s union , William J. Kennedy , said 119 members had agreed to accept the cash bonuses , or buyouts , for early retirement . The leaders of the drivers and the pressmen are strongly recommending ratification . The other nine unions have already approved their settlements. // Beyond the agreement announced yesterday , the Allied Printing Trades Council , a coalition of the newspaper unions , will meet Sept. 3 to consider a News proposal to extend the unions ' contracts to March 30 , 1987 , three years after the current expiration date , in return for wage increases totaling $110 a week over the extra three years. // " It ' s been a long siege , " said George E. McDonald , the president of the council . He said that some members of his union , the mailers , were giving up $10 , 000 a year in overtime pay . He said those " sacrifices helped save The Daily News , and I assume it will continue a long time. " // The newspaper has suffered repeated heavy blows in recent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of The Post , which in the almost six years since it was taken over by Rupert Murdoch has more than doubled its circulation , to 900 , 000 , and has won important new retail advertising . <> <> Steadily Lost Circulation // The News , by contrast , has steadily lost circulation in the city and the suburbs . Although its audited sales for the six months ended March 31 were up 3 percent , to 1. 5 million on weekdays , they compared with daily sales of 2. 4 million at the paper ' s peak in 1947 and more than two million as recently as 1974. // The News has also lost vital advertising linage , a trend it tried to reverse in 1980 by starting an afternoon edition intended to appeal to the high-income , well-educated readers whom advertisers increasingly say they want to reach . The paper spent more than $10 million on Tonight , but the afternoon edition had a circulation of only 70 , 000 , which was less than that of the early evening edition it had replaced , and the experiment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ M. Hunt , had said then that he was starting negotiations with the unions on ways to reduce the payroll , which consisted of 3 , 800 full-time positions and the equivalent of 1 , 200 additional jobs from built-in overtime and part-time work . Labor costs accounted for more than half of the newspaper ' s $360 million in expenses last year. // Mr. Hunt evolved a plan to coordinate the cuts with a shift of all printing operations out of Manhattan to free valuable space in The News ' s Art Deco office building at 42d Street and Second Avenue . The plan rested , however , on getting the Tribune Company to invest $60 million in upgrading the paper ' s Brooklyn plant , where half the newspapers are now printed . <> <> A Surprising Turn // The Tribune Company , which is closely held by about 400 shareholders , was already deeply involved in a number of capital programs and , in a surprising turn just before Christmas , said it did not want to put any more money into New York . Instead , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bidders , however , and none willing to take it without an advance agreement on labor cuts . In April the company tried to turn the newspaper over to Joe L. Allbritton , a Texas financier who had formerly owned The Washington Star. // But the unions balked at his terms , despite a statement by the Tribune Company that it would shut The News if the unions did not reach agreement with him . Then the Tribune Company abruptly changed course again , saying it would continue to operate the paper and would invest $92 million in it if the unions would provide $50 million in payroll cuts . At first the unions feared that , even if they gave up jobs , The News would go out of business in 1984 , when the present contracts end . Then , they said , they would be left with lower overall employment because the members would have surrendered jobs at The Times and The Post under the uniform contracts for the three publications . <> <> ' Me-Too Provisions ' // But The News offered to extend the current contracts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ potential costs of closing the paper - paying off job guarantees in union contracts . These costs , in excess of $200 million by one union estimate , had blocked the Tribune Company from shutting the paper during the Allbritton negotiations . The willingness to make that commitment , along with the promise of a $44 million investment in the Brooklyn plant and two new suburban printing operations , helped persuade union leaders that The News would stay in business. // Mr. McDonald said the settlements had been structured to the specific working conditions at The News and would not trigger any " me too " provisions that guarantee equality in basic manning and wage levels at all three city newspapers . Both The Times , which is solidly profitable , and The Post , which lost $20 million last year , have said they would examine the News agreements to see what desirable cost-cutting steps they offer. // The Times , which had already achieved major cost reductions through buyouts , is believed to want basic manning cuts ; The Post , which does not have the large surplus work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself now to the $110-a-week wage package. //
