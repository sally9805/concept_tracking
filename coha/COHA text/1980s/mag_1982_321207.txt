Delta duel <P> Mississippi 's Second District is nestled in the state 's rich Delta region , an area famous for cotton and the blues . If Democratic State Representative Robert G. Clark triumphs over Republican Webb Franklin in November , the Delta may add a third item to its list of distinctions : Mississippi 's first black Congressman since 1883 . <P> Clark , 53 , a furniture-store owner and operator of a small farm , is used to being a pioneer . When he won a state assembly seat in 1967 , he was the first black Mississippi legislator in nearly a century ; today the state has 17 black lawmakers . Clark is courting both races , and he claims , " No one has ever run a campaign before that has appealed across racial lines like I 'm running it . " <P> When Clark trounced three white opponents in the August primary , he captured 20% of the white vote . He will have to retain a good portion of that support in November . While the newly drawn Second District is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Justice Department intervention when recent redistricting plans appeared to dilute black voting blocs-about 20% more whites than blacks are registered to vote . This disparity has black organizations scrambling to sign up an estimated 70,000 eligible but unregistered blacks in the district 's 21 counties . Former Circuit Court Judge Franklin , 40 , is a convert to the Republican Party . His turncoat status does not seem to bother the National Republican Congressional Committee , which is pouring $34,000 into his campaign . Franklin 's total campaign budget of $225,000 is half again as fat as Clark 's $150,000 , but both candidates have strong party support . Former President Gerald Ford touted Franklin at a summer fund raiser ; Mississippi 's Democratic congressional delegation , including Senator John Stennis , held a reception for Clark in Washington . <P> The economy is the No. 1 concern in the Second District , where unemployment is approaching 15% . Mississippi is traditionally conservative but aid-hungry ; the dichotomy forces both candidates to tread a careful middle course . Franklin says his stands are " pretty tightly aligned with the President 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and concedes that benefits like food stamps are essential for the truly needy in Mississippi . " Maybe I 'm different from most who call themselves Republicans around here , " he says . " I 'm a populist person , I guess . " Clark rails against Reaganomics but supports a balanced budget , a strong defense and a vibrant private sector . <P> A recent poll that shows Clark ahead by almost 8 points could prove prophetic only if voter turnout is high . " The biggest obstacle will be people not going out to the polls , " says Clark . His very candidacy proves that race is not the hurdle it used to be in Mississippi . Sums up David Jordan , president of the Greenwood Voter 's League : " A good man has emerged who happens to be a black man . " <P> Deep roots
