In recent days , however , the usual order has sometimes been turned on its head . A rise or fall on the Tokyo market , or much smaller exchanges in London or Hong Kong , appears to have influenced the day ' s trading on Wall Street . It happened again yesterday , when early-morning reports of a robust 2. 8 percent rise in the Tokyo market and limited advances in Europe suggested a modest recovery for the United States markets . Yesterday , the Dow Jones industrial average rose 2. 9 percent. // " For days everyone just kept passing the bear market around the time clock , " Barton M. Biggs , managing director of Morgan Stanley &; Company , said yesterday . " When Tokyo broke the pattern , it made all the difference. " // Whether it continues to make a difference will not be known until 9 : 30 this morning when Big Board opens . Last night , as Wall Street rested , Tokyo stocks rose sharply in early trading. // If Asian investors and the Tokyo market are increasingly taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leadership . American investors appear to be looking to Japan to assess the Tokyo market ' s reaction to American events . The magnitude of the Japanese reaction then frequently dictates the American markets ' response . It is a little like a police officer watching " Hill Street Blues " to learn when to make an arrest . <> <> Telling Leaders From Followers // Such circular behavior has left many investors wondering how to tell the leaders from the followers . The answer lies in factors as disparate as time changes and technology , overseas investing and foreign financing of the deficit. // In part , the trading impetus follows the sun in a daily global relay race . By the time the New York exchange opens , car radios and Walkmans have been chattering for hours with closing results in Asia and midday prices in Europe . And timing can be everything . The Hong Kong exchange is smaller than the Netherlands , though doubtless a more important indicator of the regional economy . But no one ever hears about trading in the Netherlands because it is largely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // Of course , influence is also a function of size . Last April , for the first time , Japan ' s stock market became by some measures bigger than the United States ' , and the gap has widened significantly in recent days . Ten years ago , few in the United States would have even known how the Tokyo exchange closed . <> <> Geographical Limitations // More importantly , geographical limitations no longer dictate where investors place their money . Until the market collapse , Japanese investors were buying American stocks at an annual rate of $15 billion to $20 billion , or five times as much as they purchased in 1986 , according to stock exchange estimates . Meanwhile , more and more American investors were active in Tokyo , often trading in the shares of Western companies listed on more than one exchange. // Perhaps the most important linkages between markets , however , are technological and political . Traders can no longer only monitor stock action in distant lands ; they can also move money between markets in a flicker of a computer screen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 9 : 30 A.M. and 10 A.M. , the critical first half-hour of trading . At that time , American investors are still plotting their day , European traders are back from lunch , and the Japanese have already left overnight instructions . <> <> Major Bulk of Movements // " The major bulk of the market ' s movements this year occurred in the first half hour , " setting the tone for the day , said Laszlo Birinyi , manager of equity markets at Salomon Brothers. // The political connections are more subtle . By turning to foreign capital to finance the Federal deficit , some critics contend , the United States has lost some economic voting power over its own policies. // " There has been a balance-of-power shift because we are a debtor nation , " said Steven G. Einhorn , co-chairman of Goldman , Sachs ' investment policy committee , which decides in which markets the brokerage should invest . " And the reality is that it gives our lenders a say in the policies we follow . " The United States acquired what some call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than it was owed in return. // But sometimes the theories about how markets track each other fall apart . Japan ' s market underwent a 16 percent correction , ending in mid-July , that barely touched the American markets . In the United States , it was generally regarded as a long-awaited decline in an extremely overvalued market . Similarly , West Germany had a 28 percent correction that ended in the spring . It , too , had little effect on Wall Street. // The rule of thumb , then , seems to be that for markets to spur each other , they must be rising or dropping in response to common concerns . Some say this is what began happening almost two weeks ago , when an American-German dispute over monetary policy worsened jitters in the United States , contributing to a slide in Hong Kong . Those factors combined with a host of other economic worries to spark the 508-point drop in the Dow Jones industrial average on Oct. 19. // " Then , for the rest of the week , Wall Street set the daily direction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scudder International Fund , which also invests in numerous markets . " I can ' t explain why the foreign markets followed. " // Neither could some foreign political leaders , who thought that the lemming-like performance of their exchanges last week was unfounded . " The fact that the United States suffers from its twin deficits and rapidly growing foreign indebtedness no doubt explains why the worldwide fall began on Wall Street , " said Nigel Lawson , the British Chancellor of the Exchequer , in a speech Monday night . " What is less readily explicable is why the London markets should be following an attempt to second guess Wall Street quite so slavishly. " // By the time Mr. Lawson spoke that evening , however , Asia and Europe had already seized the trading momentum . By dint of timing , the Hong Kong and Tokyo markets seemed to lead to the slide on Monday of this week , and the recovery yesterday . ( Hong Kong ' s role is cloudy : Because its market was closed by local authorities last week , investors there were catching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' s influence may wane if investors decide that they can not afford to put their money in exchanges that will be shut down during crises . ) One of the critical questions for the next several weeks is whether the markets that have tracked each other so closely in recent weeks will begin to seek their own levels. // " You will find them decoupling from Wall Street after a while because they don ' t have the U.S. problems of twin deficits , " said Henry de Vismes , a director of Kleinwort Benson International Investments . " Markets assume the worst together , and then start crawling back separately. " // In time , however , the coupling-decoupling syndrome seems doomed by the spread of technology. // The networks of trading screens , open communication lines and even linked exchanges - such as the alliance between the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and its counterpart in Singapore - do not create a monolithic worldwide market . But they do allow for 24-hour trading in which decisions about where to invest , and when to move out of a market , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that each individual market can exact its own influence - slowing an advance , accelerating a decline - before the ball bounces to the next time zone . That will not make each market identical . A forthcoming Morgan Stanley Capital International study shows that , in fact , the Asian and European markets were significantly more volatile than the United States market in the first nine months of this year ; they have been less volatile than domestic markets since. // But slowly , the difference seems certain to be worn away . " The technology will never explain why things start , " Mr. Einhorn said . " But it explains a lot about why it all speeds up so fast. " //
