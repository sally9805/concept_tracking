New facts on a triple murder <P> Preparing for a convention of electrical engineers , workers at San Salvador 's Sheraton Hotel last week covered up some grisly mementos : bullet holes in a wall of the dining room , where a Salvadoran labor leader and two Americans working for agricultural reform were murdered one night 21 months ago . Even as paint and plaster were being applied , there were complaints of another cover-up in what has come to be known as the " agreform murders . " On grounds of insufficient evidence , Salvadoran Judge Hctor Enrique Jimnez Zaldivar on Oct. 1 released an army officer accused of ordering the murders . Said a U.S. embassy statement : " We are dismayed and incredulous . " <P> The ruling made it unlikely that the masterminds of the murders would quickly , if ever , be punished . For that reason , the AFL-CIO last week in Washington revealed details of the killings and their aftermath that had not yet been made public . Two of the victims , Michael Peter Hammer , 42 , an agrarian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , were in El Salvador on assignment for the American Institute for Free Labor Development , the AFL-CIO 's Latin-American arm . The third victim , Jos Rodolfo Viera , 43 , was both head of the farmworkers ' union and president of the Salvadoran institute for Agrarian Transformation . The institute was empowered under 1980 laws to take land from the country 's propertied oligarchy and redistribute it among Salvadoran peasants , a program fiercely resented by the ruling families . <P> According to the investigation jointly conducted by the AFL-CIO and the Salvadoran government , the killers were Jos Dimas Valle Acevedo , 35 , and Santiago Gmez Gonzlez , 32 , ex-corporals in El Salvador 's national guard . They were apprehended , underwent lie-detector tests , confessed and were formally arrested . Both were at the Sheraton Hotel on the night of Jan. 3 , 1981 , serving as plain-clothes bodyguards for police officers visiting the hotel . One of those officers was Lieut . Rodolfo Isidro Lpez Sibrian , 26 , known as " Posorito , " or " Little Match , " for his naming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The two enlisted men said in their confessions that Lpez Sibrian told them : " Look , inside the hotel is Viera and two other fair-skinned men . You are going to kill them . " Soon after , Lpez Sibrian handed Gmez Gonzlez a 9-mm Ingram submachine gun . Meanwhile another officer , Captain Eduardo Avila , slapped a .45-cal. submachine gun , equipped with a silencer , in Valle Acevedo 's hands . <P> The killers walked up to the three men and opened fire . Then the two gunmen darted out of the dining room and left the hotel . In a country where at least 30,000 unsolved murders have taken place in the past three years , no one moved to stop them . <P> Lpez Sibrian , who denied being at the Sheraton that night , was put in a lineup to be viewed by witnesses of the incident . However , before appearing , he was allowed to dye his red hair black , cut it and shave off his mustache . Although nobody recognized him in the lineup , he was later identified by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lie-detector test , and failed it .
