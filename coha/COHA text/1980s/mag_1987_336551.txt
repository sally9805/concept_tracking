Club Baths , San Francisco , November 1982 . . . When the moaning stopped , the young man rolled over on his back for a cigarette . Gaetan Dugas reached up for the lights , turning up the rheostat slowly so his partner 's eyes would have time to adjust . He then made a point of eyeing the purple lesions on his chest . " Gay cancer , " he said , almost as if he were talking to himself . " Maybe you 'll get it too . " <P>  --  Randy Shilts , And the Band Played On <P> Since the early days of the AIDS epidemic , researchers have reasoned that a handful of people  --  maybe even a single individual  --  bore the unknowing responsibility for having introduced the disease to North America and its first large group of victims , the homosexual community . By tracing sexual contacts , officials at the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta in 1982 found a likely candidate : one man who , through his sexual liaisons and those of his bedmates , could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Angeles , 22 cases in New York City and nine more in eight other cities  --  in all , some 40 of the first 248 cases in the U.S. The CDC acknowledged his role with an eerie sobriquet : it called him Patient Zero . <P> Now Patient Zero is publicly identified for the first time in a stunning new book on the AIDS epidemic , And the Band Played On ( St. Martin 's Press ; 630 pages ; $24.95 ) . Zero , says Author Randy Shilts , was Gaetan Dugas , a handsome blond steward for Air Canada , who used to survey the men on offer in gay bars and announce with satisfaction , " I 'm the prettiest one . " Using airline passes , he traveled extensively and picked up men wherever he went . Dugas developed Kaposi 's sarcoma , a form of skin cancer common to AIDS victims , in June 1980 , before the epidemic had been perceived by physicians . Told later he was endangering anyone he slept with , Dugas unrepentantly carried on  --  by his estimate , with 250 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , adding countless direct and indirect victims . At least one man indignantly hunted him down . Dugas ' charm proved unfailing : he sweet-talked the man into having sex again . <P> Dugas ' identity as the peripatetic Patient Zero was confirmed last week by Professor Marcus Conant of the University of California at San Francisco , a pioneer AIDS researcher . But , Conant adds , " if it had n't been this man , it would have been some other . " Dugas ' escapades are just one of many vivid and shocking stories in Shilts ' impressively researched and richly detailed narrative . The author has been covering AIDS full time for the San Francisco Chronicle since 1983 . Most of his tales underscore a theme that is painfully ; familiar to AIDS researchers : both the Federal Government and the gay community squandered lives and let the disease rage out of control by focusing on ideological preaching instead of public health .
