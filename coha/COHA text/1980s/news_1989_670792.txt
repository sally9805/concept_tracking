" Please welcome Rosie , " Mr. Kehr says . " She ' s going to do something from Madonna. " // To polite applause , a young woman takes the stage and gamely sings Madonna ' s " Dress You Up , " her eyes on the audience and a nearby television monitor ( where the lyrics roll by ) , her ears tuned to the sound system , which plays an instrumental version of the song. // It goes on all night : individual singers and groups , gently mangling recent hits and classics from " A Hard Day ' s Night " to " Wooly Bully , " to the city ' s unofficial official song , " New York , New York . " Welcome to Singalong . Nestled in an area of palm reader salons and warehouses , the club , at 17 West 19th Street ( 206-8660 ) , is giving voice to the would-be entertainer. // Singalong puts a mainstream twist on a Japanese entertainment form . It ' s a style the club ' s owners intend to export to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <> <> No Faking // The New York club , which opened in December 1987 , is a variation on the karaoke bar . Karaoke has been a quietly blossoming phenomenon that has taken hold in different parts of the United States - including the industrial Midwest , where Japanese auto makers ' plants have transplanted Japanese workers , and culture , to smokestack America. // Karaoke is a variation on lip-synching or air-guitar contests , those other mergers of fantasy and popular music . But faking it - mouthing the lyrics , with 200 or so onlookers shouting lustily ( or booing good-naturedly ) - just won ' t do . As the name says , you ' ve got to sing along. // In New York , karaoke ( the word , pronounced car-ah-OAK-ee , means " empty orchestra " ) has predominantly been found in clubs catering to a largely Japanese clientele and playing mostly Japanese music - like the Iroha Restaurant , at 142 West 49th Street , and Ichiban , at 7 West 46th Street . Now , as Singalong suggests , karaoke is attracting a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people at Singalong approach the microphone timorously , their voices barely above a whisper // But others show more than a glimmer of show-business pizazz . Sal , a young , muscular man dressed in a red sweatsuit , took the stage on a recent night and belted out " Under the Boardwalk , " the old Drifters ' chestnut , with a zest the crowd quickly appreciated. // " Hey , this guy ' s good , " a man in the packed house said . " He got allll the words right. " // Donald Zuckerman and Mindy Birnbaum , two of the four owners of Singalong , had a vision of this star-maker machinery back in the summer of 1987. // An original partner in the Ritz nightclub in 1980 , Mr. Zuckerman managed the rock singer Patti Smyth and co-produced her band , Scandal . It was on a tour of Japan with that group that he first saw karaoke. // " I didn ' t think much of it at the time , " he said . " But a couple of years later , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We thought we ' d take a chance and see if we could Americanize karaoke . We knew it was big in Japan . " <> <> Follow the Bouncing Ball // Ms. Birnbaum , a lawyer and the club ' s operations partner , said , " We felt the time was right for the audience to be part of the entertainment. " // At the club , the audience follows the lyrics on television monitors . In a classic bit of Americana , the celebrated " bouncing ball " stops and starts over the letters , according to the music ' s rhythm. // A cameraman , perched in a loft above the dance floor , shoots videos of groups . " We shoot every group that gets onstage , and they ' re available afterward for $10 apiece , " Ms. Birnbaum said. // Between songs , the audience croons to television-show theme songs . Recalling the lyrics from " The Brady Bunch " is a standing memory exercise for regulars . And loyal patrons also know the " Jeffersons " theme song by heart . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ former disk jockey , said there is some initial reluctance from newcomers about getting on the stage . " But after a few drinks , they ' re maniacs , " he said one recent weekend night . " These people work all day in offices . Friday is their party night . They let their inhibitions out . You watch . By 9 o ' clock tonight we ' ll have people with their ties off and up around their heads. " // Patrons make their choices from a 150-song " menu . " The club , which charges $5 for admission , pays an annual royalty to Broadcast Music Incorporated and the American Society of Composers and Publishers for performance rights to the songs . <> <> Different From Japan // Taro Nakamura , a Japanese businessman , has been a frequent visitor to Singalong , which opens at 5 P.M. Tuesdays through Fridays and 7 P.M. on Saturdays . " I ' ve been here on my own 10 to 12 times before and always on a Friday night - when it ' s packed , " Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the old piano bars are here , real quiet , " he said . " Nothing like this . Only here are people so vivacious . This clapping and getting onstage - this would never happen in Japan . Only in America. " // There are plans by the Chelsea club ' s owners to take the Singalong idea to other cities , as limited partnerships financed by outside investors . The first Singalong outside New York City is to open on May 11 in the Buckhead section of Atlanta , with a benefit for the Atlanta Food Bank , an organization that feeds the homeless , Mr. Zuckerman said . " Then we go to Chicago about mid-August , and then to Los Angeles , in which we should open no later than Nov. 1 , " he said . " We ' ve had discussions with people in Paris , London and other American cities. " // " We believe this is the next form of entertainment , " Mr. Zuckerman said . " There are a lot of people out there who want to go out and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a nonintimidating atmosphere - and the fact that most people who get up there can ' t sing at all - they ' re getting the fantasy of being performers. // " With this , they can go to a show and be part of a show . It could be the next big entertainment fad in America . And with a little luck , it won ' t be a fad . It could stick around. " //
