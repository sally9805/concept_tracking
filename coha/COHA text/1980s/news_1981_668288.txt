By Eileen Ogintz Chicago Tribune GRAND CANYON , Ariz. - They climbed to the top of a cliff and stood staring , mesmerized by the rushing whitewater on the Colorado River below . The group ' s five-person rubber rafts soon would plow through this rapid - called Lava Falls , one of the largest and most dangerous on the river . Some of the group had been traveling down the Colorado River - with the walls of the Grand Canyon on either side - for almost two weeks , maneuvering through rapids that barely jolted their crafts and others so ferocious that they had caused one craft to overturn plunging its occupants in the icy water for a few terrifying moments . But Lava Falls , coming near the end of the trip , was larger than most of the others and seemed more frightening . That ' s why the group had stopped above it , so the boatmen , who each had been down the river dozens of times , could look at the rapid and determine the best way this particular day to navigate the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Let ' s do it , " one of the boatmen yelled , then each of the rafts plowed through the white waves , the boatmen rowing , the occupants holding tightly to ropes at the bow , shrieking and screaming as they were hit with icy waves , as the raft twisted and bumped through the whitewater . Then in a few seconds that seemed like minutes , it was over . The boats , intact , were through the rapid , and the Colorado once again was smooth and quiet . There was great cheering , backslapping and the welcome appearance of a bottle of tequila , quickly gulped by the cold and wet rafters in one craft . Warmed by the tequila , I realized Lava Falls had frightened me more than anything had in years . And it felt just great to have made it through unscathed , even though I had done nothing but hang on . Other days on the river were less momentous - and more rigorous . We each rowed through some of the gentler rapids , loaded and unloaded our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cooked for the 25 of us . Some days the water would be calm for hours on end ; we ' d sunbathe on the rafts , read and photograph the spectacular canyon scenery and each other . We even tied two rafts together one afternoon so several rafters could float down the river playing poker . They used butterscotch hard candies as chips , eating the loot as the afternoon wore on . There were brutal water fights , and afternoons spent climbing up a side canyon to swim and play in isolated - and spectacular waterfalls . The river has a rhythm of its own , and within a few days everyone was living it . There were no televisions , radios or newspapers in the canyon , but no one seemed to mind being out of touch with the rest of the world . No one was ordered to do anything , be it cooking , cleaning up , hiking or rowing . Somehow , there always were enough volunteers to take care of the chores . People did as they pleased , lazing about , rowing hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suits , jogging shorts , and sneakers . Most of the men stopped shaving . The women seemed to avoid mirrors as well as makeup . We slept on the banks of the river each night in sleeping bags , literally under the stars . There was no need for tents . It never rained or got really cold , although it was late autumn . The trip had started for me and half a dozen others when we hiked some 10 miles into the canyon to meet the rest of the group on this Arizona Raft Adventures trip . They had " put out " a week earlier at Lees Ferry , Ariz. , and had traveled more than 80 miles down river before we joined them . My eight days on the river cost $635 ; their 13-day trip was in the neighborhood of $900 . Together we would travel 135 miles down river before we all " put out " on an Indian reservation at Diamond Creek . ( An old school bus transported us 20 miles to Peach Springs , the nearest town , and a chartered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plane connections . ) We carried only 30-pound knapsacks with personal gear down the steep trail into the canyon . Later we transferred our belongings to waterproof dunnage bags already stowed on the rafts , along with sleeping bags and life jackets for everyone . The one rule throughout this decidedly casual expedition involved those orange life jackets : Everyone-boatmen included-had to wear them whenever we were on the river , even if there wasn ' t a rapid in sight . Not much is needed on a trip like this - two bathing suits , sunglasses , shirts , a wool sweater ( it will keep you warm even if it gets wet ) , jeans , shorts and two pairs of tennis shoes ( so one pair can stay dry for land use ) . Perhaps the most important item was suntan lotion ; even in September the sun was very hot . We protected camera equipment by keeping it in watertight ammunition boxes that were carefully tied down on the rafts along with our gear . Amazingly , it seemed , nothing ever got lost when we plowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ river started the same . We usually woke at dawn to breakfast being cooked by early risers . It was typical camp fare : granola , eggs , French toast , bacon , sausage , coffee . We cooked on gas stoves ; the National Park Service prohibits using driftwood to make fires on the river banks . After a quick meal , we ' d load the rafts , securely tying down everything , even the small bags that held our suntan lotion and other supplies for that day . There was beer and fruit juice , staying cold in the water in a burlap bag tied to the rafts . And there were plenty of nuts , dried fruits and cookies to tide even the heartiest appetites over until lunch . After several hours - and at least one waterfight and two healthy rapids - we ' d stop for a picnic lunch of cheese , tuna , peanut butter sandwiches , nuts , cookies and plenty of juice . We ' d lie in the sun , sometimes play in nearby side canyons and waterfalls and , occasionally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - it was too cold - although some of us took several rapids hanging onto a big black inner tube instead of a raft . Most evening by 5 p.m. some 16 miles farther down the river than we ' d been that morning , we ' d make camp on the river bank . And while most of us would be hurrying to get into dry clothes and to stake out a spot in the sand , the volunteer cooks ( usually including me ) would whip up gargantuan meals such as vegetarians lasagna one night , enchilades another , steaks , spaghetti , brownies , cakes-you name it , it seemed we had it . It was almost always delicious , although I remember one chicken curry that was a flop . Invariably we ate and ate and ate . Who cared bout calories ? Bathing suits never get snug . Then by 9 or 10 p.m. , after a few beers or some wine , everyone was in a sleeping bag , dreaming about the next day ' s rapids . At least that ' s what they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
