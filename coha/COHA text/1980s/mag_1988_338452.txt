The Reagan Administration has long been trying to brand Fidel Castro a violator of human rights . But Cuba denies U.S. charges that it holds several thousand political prisoners and that some are being kept in dungeon-like jails and have been tortured . Last week a five-member panel from the International Committee of the Red Cross began a month-long inspection tour of 15 prisons , the first time the organization has been given permission to make such an investigation . The group 's first stop was the Boniato jail , where the investigators reportedly found no plantados , the counterrevolutionaries who allegedly have come in for harsh treatment because they refuse rehabilitation . <P> Castro may have decided to permit the ICRC inspection for good reason .
