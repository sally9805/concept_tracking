When asked by of one her dinner companions if she does indeed have a friend in the Keystone State , 16-year-old Kseniya , who lives in Moscow , laughs and gives a sticky thumbs-up sign . ' ' I like to be with the people here , ' ' she says in halting English . ' ' To help people understand how to ( live ) together. ' ' // // Kseniya , along with nine other Soviet children , is in the United States as part of the Soviet-American musical ' ' Peace Child ' ' - a semiprofessional theatrical production featuring Soviet and American youths now on a 12-city North American tour as part of the United Nations International Year of Peace. // An outgrowth of the ' ' space bridge , ' ' the Soviet-American satellite hookup broadcast between Moscow and Minneapolis last summer , the current ' ' Peace Child ' ' production , which just returned from a three-week tour in the Soviet Union , represents one of the first cultural exchanges to occur between the two superpowers since last November ' s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the Soviet rock band Stas Namin ( which recently organized a benefit concert for victims of the Chernobyl nuclear accident ) , ' ' Peace Child ' ' will be performed at a special UN Peace Day celebration in New York today. // ' ' Ours is a project that offers a challenge to children that they can have some effectiveness in the world peace process , ' ' says David Woollcombe , the British writer and director of the show , whose plot centers on the friendship between an American girl and a Soviet boy who set in motion a successful global peace effort. // Although far less culturally significant than the recent North American tour by the Kirov Ballet or the Moscow performances by pianist Vladimir Horowitz , ' ' Peace Child ' ' has gained symbolic significance . It comes at a time of chilled relations between the US and the Soviet Union , largely in the wake of the jailing of American reporter Nicholas Daniloff , who has been charged with spying on the Soviets in Moscow. // Recent ' ' Peace Child ' ' performances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weeks ago a tear-gas bombing in New York disrupted the tour of the Soviet Moiseyev Dance Company . Meanwhile , the Chautauqua Conference , a cultural and diplomatic exchange sponsored by the Chautauqua Institution and the Eisenhower Institute , to be held in the Soviet Union this week , was almost scrapped until until Mr. Daniloff was released into US custody last Friday. // ' ' It has been our policy all along not to sacrifice cultural exchanges to such political crises as the Daniloff affair , ' ' says Ambassador Stephen H. Rhinesmith , co-ordinator of the US Information Agency ' s US-Soviet Exchange Initiative and a Chautauqua delegate. // ' ' The US decided to make ( the Daniloff case ) a major political issue now , ' ' says Vladimir Litvinov , an official of the Soviet Union ' s Ministry of Culture and the official Soviet representative on the ' ' Peace Child ' ' tour . ' ' But these youth and cultural exchanges are separate . They go along with ( President Reagan ' s ) original initiative. ' ' // The General Exchanges Agreement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze at last fall ' s Geneva summit conference has resulted in more than a dozen new educational , cultural , and scientific exchanges between the two superpowers , the first of which were announced last month . Collectively , the exchanges represent the revival of US-Soviet cultural initiatives , nearly all of which were canceled by President Carter in 1979 after the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. // While the first of these exchanges won ' t occur until 1987 , the current ' ' Peace Child ' ' tour , which has no official US involvement , is already demonstrating the results of the Geneva agreement. // ' ' This is one of the first times in the history of the Soviet Union and America that children from both countries are living and working together , ' ' says Mr. Litvinov . ' ' When you trust your own children to another country , this is something . ' ' ' ' Certainly the ' Peace Child ' tour could not have happened without that ( summit ) accord , ' ' adds Mr. Woollcombe. // A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrote the original ' ' Peace Child ' ' script as part of the UN International Year of Disarmament five years ago . It is based on the European best seller ' ' The Peace Book , ' ' by French writer Bernard Benson , and features music and lyrics by the group Stas Namin and David Gordon . ' ' Peace Child ' ' debuted in London in 1981 and has been performed nearly 500 times. // ' ' The primary purpose is to get ' Peace Child ' replicated in schools , churches , and youth groups , where children come together , research their own peace issues , and present their findings , ' ' says Woollcombe . ' ' In this tour , one can only hint at that larger purpose. ' ' // Indeed , the current ' ' Peace Child ' ' production plays as an ennobled version of the spunky ' ' Up with People , ' ' an amateurish blend of sentiment and didacticism that invokes the spirit of everyone from George Santayana to Martin Luther King . Much of its emotional power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ won ' t you hear our small plea . . . and announce to the world this will be a Peace Day , ' ' plaintively sung by children . The US Information Agency ' s Mr. Rhinesmith suggests that the production ' ' smacks of ' ' Soviet propaganda . Director Woollcombe insists that ' ' this is a cultural and youth exchange exercise , not a political one. ' ' // The Soviet and American children on the tour , however , could not sound more sincere . ' ' Our hope is that people who don ' t know much about each other will become united in their desire for peace and not fear each other , ' ' says Kseniya. // ' ' When I first heard about ' Peace Child ' I just thought it was another show , ' ' says Sara Hardin , a 10-year-old cast member from Santa Barbara , Calif . ' ' But I started to get into the subject and now I know peace is possible . In Russia , we had standing-room-only every night. ' ' // ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am not going to just go back to school and sit in class and hear them say bad things about the Russians , ' ' adds Paula Callahan , another cast member , from Boston. // ' ' Peace Child ' ' will travel next to Minneapolis , then to Seattle ; Vancouver , British Columbia ; San Francisco ; and Los Angeles , ending its tour in Washington Oct 8. // //
