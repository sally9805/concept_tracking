The Shubert Theatre , New York City . March 18 , 1922 . The stage is bare , except for a semi-circle of seven chairs . A large screen is mounted upstage . It is blank . The lights in the auditorium dim as they brighten on the stage . After a few quiet moments , the participants come onto the stage in single file  --  four from stage left , three from stage right . Some of them seem vaguely familiar , others are easily identifiable . They take their seats . The Man on the far left rises . THE MAN Ladies and gentlemen : The Mayor of the City of New York  --  the Honorable John F. Hylan . ( Mayor Hylan comes onto the stage from the right wing . He is a portly , distinguished man in his fifties . He wears a flowing mustache and pince-nez . He is dressed conservatively : dark suit , grey vest , grey spats  --  but a pink tie . Applause as he comes to the center of the stage ) MAYOR JOHN F. HYLAN Good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speaks the name , a huge blow-up of the famous Frueh caricature of Bert Williams is projected on the screen . OPPOSITE . Mayor Hylan turns to look at it . The seven participants rise and face the screen and applaud . The audience applauds . All sit ) We have not foregathered to mourn our friend who departed from us only two short weeks ago  --  rather , we meet to remember him together , to celebrate his remarkable life , to bring him back  --  if only for an hour or so . You will note that all of us are gaily clad , and that I wear no somber black tie . ( He takes out his pink tie and waves it , sort of ) As we all know , this was Bert 's favorite color . I sometimes think he invented it . Certainly he brought a great deal of it into my life . He was , among other things , one of our city 's most distinguished and valuable citizens . We met often , sometimes at his instigation , more frequently at mine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also of its more mundane and pragmatic aspects : streetcleaning , traffic , and what to do about unhygienic restaurants . And then he invariably told me a few stories  --  usually about corrupt mayors or dumbbell politicians . One of the last ones was about his great comic creation  --  Spruce Bigby . He said that in a recent town election , Spruce told him that he had voted seven times . " Why 'd you do that ? " he asked . ( He attempts an imitation of Bert Williams ) " To show how much I liked de man , " said Spruce . Well , I would vote seven times seven for Bert Williams . I love Bert  --  and I use the present tense , for he will never be dead to me . And now I wish to step aside and let a few of his dearest friends and colleagues remember him for you , but before I do so , I must discharge one pleasant duty which has been bestowed upon me .

WITH THE PASSING OF BERT WILLIAMS A RARE AND PRODIGIOUS AMOUNT OF LAUGHTER , DIGNITY , NOBILITY , COMPASSION , AND LOVE HAS GONE FROM OUR WORLD . BERT WILLIAMS CAN NEVER BE REPLACED . SIGNED : WARREN GAMALIEL HARDING , PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES . " Thank you . ( He leaves the stage . The Man who announced him now rises and comes forward . He is small , thin , nervous . He has large eyes and speaks in a piping voice . He wears a pink carnation in his buttonhole ) p. 3 THE SMALL MAN My name is Eddie Gamaliel Cantor . ( The onstage group laughs and applauds . The Frueh caricature is replaced by a photograph of Bert Williams with Eddie Cantor . OPPOSITE ) When I was a kid  --  I 'm talking about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fan Bert Williams ever had . I wanted more than anything to get into show business and I figured that any money I spent to buy tickets to Bert Williams shows were good investments . I would save up , go without lunches until I had enough for a ticket , and sometimes  --  I guess it 's all right to tell it now  --  I would sneak into the theatre . So you can imagine my feelings when I got hired by Florenz Ziegfeld to actually play alongside Bert Williams in the Ziegfeld Follies of Nineteen-sixteen . When we were introduced to each other at the first rehearsal , I damn near fainted . It was like if somebody suddenly said to a playwright , " Meet William Shakespeare . " Now , when he did n't have his burnt cork makeup on and that funny shuffling walk , Bert Williams was a tall , handsome man with light brown skin and a general feeling of being an aristocrat . When we were introduced he smiled at me and put out his hand and said , " Young man , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That song of his  --  " Nobody . " He told me once he must 've sung it five thousand times  --  but the public would n't let him stop . They used to call him Mister Nobody . ( The lights on stage dim ) . Anybody who ever heard and saw him do that number never forgot it . ( The stage lights are out , and only one pin-spot hits the right proscenium . Introduction music begins . Piano , cornet , drums . A white glove appears , wiggling . Then an arm , a shoulder , torso , head . Finally , the full figure of Bert Williams . The projection changes to a blow-up of Bert Williams in his " Nobody " costume . OPPOSITE . Slightly short trousers , battered high-hat , too big shoes , frock coat , white gloves . He moves slowly across the stage from right to left , shuffling , and looking at the audience only when he sings or speaks the word , " Nobody ! " ) p. 4 BERT WILLIAMS WHEN LIFE SEEMS FULL OF @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SOOTHES MY THUMPING , BUMPING BRAIN ? NOBODY !

( As he ambles off sadly , forlorn , the spotlight fades and the lights come back upon the stage . Eddie Cantor is in place , looking at the spot where Bert made his exit . In a reverie , he echoes the final line of the song ) p. 5 EDDIE CANTOR ( Singing dreamily )  --  I DO N'T INTEND TO DO NOTHIN ' FOR NOBODY NO TIME . ( He comes to and continues ) As a performer , he was close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of us would like to be . As a friend , he was my personal god . He did n't know the meaning of envy or jealousy . In the Follies of nineteen-nineteen , I made a big hit with a kind of an after-the-war song called , " How You Gon na Keep ' Em Down on the Farm . " Remember ? ( He goes into the song , a la Cantor : handclapping and leaping ) HOW YOU GON NA KEEP ' EM DOWN ON THE FARMAFTER THEY 'VE SEEN PAREE ? HOW YOU GON NA KEEP ' EM AWAY FROM BROADWAYJAZZIN ' AROUND , JAZZIN ' AROUND ? Well , it went great . Bert , believe me , he was just as happy as I was . Not only that . He sat down and himself wrote several encore choruses that would assure my being an even bigger hit than I was . Whenever I go to work on a scene or on a part , I always stop and ask myself , " How would Bert do this ? " And then I try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off on me . The problems of his people were important to him . Even in happy moments  --  and we had plenty together  --  there was always underneath a kind of melancholy . Once in a while it would slip out . I remember one New Year 's Eve . After the show most of the cast headed out of the theatre on the way to parties and celebrations . Bert and I had arranged to avoid the crowds and see the New Year in together at The Hotel Knickerbocker , Forty-Second Street and Broadway where we were living . He was allowed to stay there provided he used the service elevator . I was supposed to go and pick up a turkey that we 'd ordered from a restaurant and as we started out of the stage door . ( The lights onstage dim , and come up in an area on the right . It suggests the interior stage door entrance of The New Amsterdam Theatre . The Stage Doorman sits , back to , smoking a pipe and reading ZIT 'S . PRODUCTION NOTE : The Stage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Williams appears  --  as himself . Now that he has removed the burnt cork , we see that his skin is light brown . He is handsome  --  beautifully groomed , dressed , and shod . He wears a long , fur-lined coat with a fur collar ( tailored in Paris ) ; a smart derby ( from Lock in London ) ; white scarf . He is putting on his white kid gloves as Eddie approaches ) p. 6 EDDIE CANTOR Great show tonight , hey , Bert ? Good audience . BERT WILLIAMS Yes , they were . But not as good as I was ! ( He and Eddie share a laugh . We have noted that in contrast to his created stage persona , his voice and speech are models of refinement . Intimations of an Oxonian accent ) EDDIE CANTOR Why do n't you go on over to the hotel ? Porky  --  you know , the bootlegger  --  BERT WILLIAMS Porky ? ! Are you allowed to say that name ? ( Another laugh ) EDDIE CANTOR All right . So Mr. Rinaldi is bringing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pick up the turkey and the rest of the stuff . BERT WILLIAMS And do n't forget the " waddymelon "  --  Yassuh , yassuh ! EDDIE CANTOR Waddymelon ? That 's not for New Year 's Eve ! That 's for Rosh Hashanah . Come on . BERT WILLIAMS Very well . ( He smiles , ruefully ) Here I go  --  on my way to the service elevator . ( They stand looking at each other for a time . Finally , Bert speaks , still smiling ) It would n't be so bad , Eddie , if I did n't hear the applause still ringing in my ears . ( He walks across the stage , slowly ) p. 7 EDDIE CANTOR That was the only hint of bitterness I ever heard from him in all our years together . And then , on his way to the hotel , he stopped into a little speakeasy we used to go to back of The Hotel Knickerbocker . ( Lights fade on Eddie and the stage door and come up , stage left . There is a bar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bartender is behind the bar . Bert comes in . PRODUCTION NOTE : The Bartender is played by the Protean Player ) BERT WILLIAMS Good evening . ( No response ) I 'll have a Scotch , please . Haig and Haig , with Perrier . No ice . Cold as hell out . People are starting to take in their brass monkeys . ( No response ) BARTENDER ( Without moving ) Haig and Haig ? BERT WILLIAMS Please . BARTENDER Perrier ? BERT WILLIAMS Yes . BARTENDER ( Still not moving ) That 'll be fifty bucks a shot , boy . ( A pause . Bert takes a beautiful alligator wallet ( Hermes ) from his breast pocket and carefully extracts three bills ) BERT WILLIAMS Fine . Give me six shots , boy . ( He puts three one-hundred dollar bills on the bar , deliberately . One at a time . The Bartender gapes ) Oh , yes . And here 's your tip . ( He puts another one-hundred dollar bill on the bar ) Now make it snappy , boy . I 'm in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a miasma of confusion ) Happy New Year . ( Blackout on the bar . The lights come back up on Eddie Cantor , center stage ) p. 8 EDDIE CANTOR When he told me about that later , he said , " You know , Eddie  --  people who are sure of themselves are the ones who are without prejudice . " March the fourth , nineteen-twenty-two . The most terrible day in my life . My teacher , my friend , the man I owed so much to  --  suddenly , uselessly gone . Think of it . Forty-six years old . It shocked me and all show business  --  in fact , the whole country . Over six thousand people came to his funeral . There were editorials . Because he was more , than a great entertainer  --  he was a great man . He brought joy and laughter but also inspiration and the will to fight for the dignity of the individual and the opportunity that 's supposed to be the heritage of all Americans . I 've known a lot of outstanding people in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an Al Jolson come once in a generation  --  but a Bert Williams , once in a lifetime . I remember how he used to shuffle on and . ( The lights fade on full stage and a spotlight hits Bert Williams as he comes shuffling on from left proscenium . He stops and looks at the audience ) BERT WILLIAMS I just been over this morning to see my banker and it was  --  ( He stops ) You ever notice how people always saying " my banker , " " my doctor , " " my lawyer , " and all like that ? You ever hear anybody say , " my pawnbroker ? " No ? Me neither . So I went over to see my banker and get me some money to get me a shave and a haircut for the wedding tomorrow . And I made out the slip and handed it in . And my banker , he looks at the slip and he shoves it back to me and he says  --  mean , " You ca n't take out no one dollar . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mean old man  --  You ever notice how many mean people are old ? That 's because death does n't want them any more than anybody else . So he says , " Three dollars  --  that 's the millenium . Next , please . " So I go outside and I think things over and I go back and I say , " All right , give me the three dollars . " And he does . And then I say , " I 'd like to make a de-posit of two dollars . " And he had to take it . ( He gets out a dollar bill  --  shows it and smiles . He takes another step or two toward stage center  --  stops again ) Friend of mine  --  all upset ' cause he said his wife is always asking him for money . He says first she wants a dollar , then she wants two dollars , then she asks for fifty cents . I say , " What does she want with all that money ? " He says , " I du n @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Same fella got a job peddling some kind a patent clothes wringer door to door . And after the first day he came home and his wife asked him , " Well , how many orders you git today ? " And he says , " I got two orders in de first place I went . " " Why dat 's fine , " says the wife . " Yassuh . Two orders . Git out an ' stay out . " ( He takes three steps this time before he stops ) I kind of got hurt a little bit in a streetcar accident two weeks back . And the streetcar company come sending their agent round to me . And he asks me how much I want for damages . I said , " I do n't want nothing for damages , I need some money for repairs . " So then he says will I settle for fifteen hundred dollars ? And I told him to go right back and tell his company I would n't take less than a thousand dollars to save their life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Two more steps . He stops ) I went down last week to take the examination to get on the police force . First thing they give was they say , " A man buys an article for twelve dollars and a quarter and he sells it for nine dollars and seventy-five cents . Do he gain or lose on de transaction ? " I give him the answer like that  --  ( He snaps his fingers ) " He gain on de cents but he loses on de dollars . " ( He looks puzzled ) They said , " Fine , dat would be enough , " but I ai n't heared nothing more from it . ( Another step or two takes him stage center ) So I went into Simmons Barber Shop and I sat down and looked at The Po-lice Gazette . And old Simmons he 's got a stranger in the chair and he 's shaving him and talking . ( Bert Williams now demonstrates his remarkable gift for pantomime and mimicry . He becomes Simmons  --  a nervous man with a high voice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He holds the straight razor in the correct position . He stops now and then to strop the razor  --  to re-lather the man 's face  --  to wipe the razor , and so on . He works carefully and meticulously , tilting the stranger 's head from side to side . Careful around the ears . Short strokes around the nostrils ) p. 9 SIMMONS Money . Used to be good money in this business one time , but no mo ' . Tryin ' to make ends meet  --  . Why it 's enough to drive a man crazy like it did po ' Jim . Yeah . We had to send ' im to the loonytik asylum . Sent ' im yesterday . THE STRANGER ( Low-voiced ) Who 's Jim ? SIMMONS Why Jim is my twin brother , suh . Yassuh , Jim jus ' kep ' on worryin ' and frettin ' about money , money , money and hard times and everythin ' till he just naturally went crazy . Yassuh , me and him worked together here side by side for years . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't tell nary one of us from de other . De fact is both of us got to worryin ' an ' broodin ' a whole lot all de time . THE STRANGER About money ? SIMMONS Yassuh , and business . You see prices is so low dat unless a customer takes a shampoo it do n't pay to just shave ' im and cut his hair . Po ' Jim . Po ' , po ' Jim . ( He tilts the stranger 's head up , taking his chin , the better to shave around the Adam 's apple ) I caught him tryin ' to cut one of our customer 's throat , ' cause de gentleman would n't let Jim shampoo ' im . ( He is still shaving the stranger 's throat ) So I had to have my po ' twin brother put away . I du n no . Maybe I should 've let ' im go ahead an ' slash de man a little . Dat might 've stopped ' im from goin ' crazy . Oh , well . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shampoo , suh ? p. 10 BERT WILLIAMS ( As he continues his shuffle across the stage . He stops again ) My brother do n't like banks . Got no faith in any banks of any kind . He lays up all his money in these gaudy fancy store clothes he likes to wear . One time when he heard that some bank in town had failed , he said , " Bust away ! Bust on ! But you ca n't hurt these lavender pants . " ( Another move . Stop ) Too much drinking produces a largeness of the liver  --  and a smallness of the pocketbook . Anyhow , nobody should ever get drunk above the neck . ( One step . And a stop ) When a man takes two cee-gars  --  puts one of them in his mouth and hands you the other one saying that they are two-for-a-quarter  --  you can bet that he is getting ready to smoke the twenty-cent one . ( A move to stop ) Beggarman comes up to me begging for money . I say , " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BEGGAR I tell you true , brother . I beg to git money to buy whiskey . BERT WILLIAMS But why do you drink whiskey ? THE BEGGAR So I can git de nerve to beg ! BERT WILLIAMS ( He moves , stops ) Bill Collector knocks on the door . Lady comes . p. 11 THE BILL COLLECTOR Is a Mister Beauregard in ? THE LADY No , suh . THE BILL COLLECTOR Can you tell me where he is ? THE LADY No suh , I cinnot . THE BILL COLLECTOR When did you see him last ? THE LADY ( Casually ) At his fune'ral . THE BILL COLLECTOR And who are you ? THE LADY I 'm his remains . BERT WILLIAMS And she slammed the door . ( He moves to the proscenium right ) Money ! Money is like de air you breathe . Any time you stop gettin ' it  --  Good Night ! ( He goes off . The lights return to the full stage . The Man seated to the left of Eddie Cantor now rises and makes his way to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distinguished-looking creature , with a pink face and a shock of white hair . He wears a black suit and a clerical collar , a pink handkerchief peeks from his long jacket . THE PROJECTION CHANGES TO A PHOTOGRAPH OF WILLIAMS IN " BOBBY " ) THE MAN Good afternoon . I am David Belasco . The Bert Williams I knew was the simplest , kindest , most amiable and most likeable man I have ever known . He was a delightful entertainer . He was a sincere and careful artist . He was a genuine comedian . To see and hear him was to be instantly amused . To have the mind diverted and drawn away from any saddening thoughts of the pain and mutability of human experience . It is not my province this afternoon to dwell upon the record of what he did . It is mine only to utter my brief estimate of what he was . Yet in passing I may be permitted to mention one matter perhaps of interest . Many years ago I chanced to see Ira Aldrich  --  the once famous negro actor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Othello he was electrifying . So in my constant quest for novelties I found myself wondering whether I might not discover and develop a negro player competent to portray great tragic characters before a modern audience . p. 12 DAVID BELASCO ( continuing ) And then I saw Bert Williams . I went to see him night after night . He was always fresh ; always new . He had an uncanny ability to become another person in an instant with no more than a gesture , or an inflection . I became convinced that he could do anything to which he set his superlative mind . I took to dropping in to his dressing room at odd times , always hoping to convince him to put himself into my hands . For a time we talked of OTHELLO . I was certain that he could bring it off . Bert thought about it , studied it . ( Belasco walks to the left proscenium . The suggestion of a dressing room . The makeup table faces the audience  --  mirror removed . Bert sits making up , covering his face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stands behind him . They converse by means of the mirror ) DAVID BELASCO Well , what say you , Bert ? Shall we stun them ? BERT WILLIAMS Mr. B , I 've been thinking and thinking and talking to Lottie and even doing it for her  --  in the middle of the night sometimes  --  and I 'm going to tell you the truth . DAVID BELASCO Do . The truth is always best . BERT WILLIAMS I 'm scared . You see , when I black up like this , it 's a mask for me . I 'm hiding in here some place . I 'm not me . I 'm Spruce Bigby , or whoever I choose . p. 13 DAVID BELASCO ( Persuasively , hypnotically ) Choose Othello , Bert . ( Bert slips off his dressing gown and begins to dress ) BERT WILLIAMS Mr. B  --  What if they laughed at me ? I could n't do that to you . DAVID BELASCO Have no fear of damaging me , my friend . ( Bert goes on with his comic getup . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice is mellifluous , resonant ; his speech is impeccable ) BERT WILLIAMS " Soft you ; a word or two before you go . I have done the State some service , and they know't . No more of that . I pray you , in your letters , When you shall these unlucky deeds relate , ( He puts on an outsize shoe ) A VOICE ( From off ) Three minutes , Mr. Williams ! BERT WILLIAMS ( Continuing ) " Nor set down aught in malice : then , must you speak Of one that lov 'd not wisely but too well ; " ( He puts on another shoe ) " Of one not easily jealous , but , being wrought , Perplex 'd in the extreme ; of one whose hand , Like the base Indian , threw a pearl away  --  " ( He dons the crazy frock-coat ) " Richer than all his tribe ; of one whose subdu 'd eyes Albeit unused to the melting mood , Drops tears as fast as the Arabian trees Their med'cinal gum . Set you down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hat ) " And say besides , that in Aleppo once , Where a malignant and a turban 'd Turk Beat a Venetian and traduc 'd the state ,  --  " ( He puts on his white cotton gloves ) " I took by the throat the circumcis 'd dog , And smote him thus . " ( He stabs himself with a rabbit 's foot ) p. 14 A VOICE ( From off ) You ' re on , Mr. Williams ! ( Introduction music is heard . Piano , drums cornet ) BERT WILLIAMS ( Continuing ) " I kiss 'd thee ere I kill 'd thee : no way but this ; Killing myself to die upon a kiss . " ( He stumbles off . The intro music repeats . A hot sharp spotlight hits the left proscenium . Bert shuffles on , singing . The number is " You Can not Make Your Shimmy Shake On Tea . " It is a song and dance number with both the real shimmy and the inhibited one performed ) BERT WILLIAMS ( Singing ) ' T IS A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TEAFOR NOW MY DANCING ASPIRATIONS &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; HAVE N'T GOT A CHANCE , IN THE HARLEM CABARETSIS USED TO SPEND MY NIGHTS AND DAYSPARTAKING OF MY FAV'RITE INDOOR SPORT , &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; THE SHIMMY DANCEON THE DAY THEY INTRODUCED THEIR PROHIBITION LAWSTHEY JUST WENT AND RUIN 'D THE GREATEST SHIMMY &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; DANCER BECAUSE : ( CHORUS ) YOU CAN NOT MAKE YOUR SHIMMY SHAKE ON TEA , IT SIMPLY CA N'T BE DONE , YOU 'LL FIND YOUR SHAKING AI N'T TAKING , UNLESS YOU HAS THE PROPER JAZZ , THAT ONLY COMES WITH SUCH DRINKS AS GREEN RIVER , &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; HAIG AND HAIG AND HENNESSEY , WAY OUT IN CHINA AMONG THE PALE CHINESE , THERE 'S NOTHING FINER THAN GOOD OLD CHINA TEAS , BUT THEN YOU NEVER SAW A CHINAMAN A SHAKING &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; HIS CHEMISE'CAUSE YOU CAN NOT MAKE YOUR SHIMMY SHAKE ON TEA . p. 15 BERT WILLIAMS ( continued ) ( Singing ) YOU CAN NOT MAKE YOUR SHIMMY SHAKE ON TEA , IT SIMPLY CA N'T BE DONEYOU 'LL FIND YOUR SHAKING @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ YOU NEEDS A LITTLE BIT OF SCOTCH &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; OR RYE TO LUBRICATE YOUR KNEEA CUP OF CEYLON IT MAY BE STRONG OR WEAKWO N'T HELP YOU SPEIL-ON BECAUSE ITS MUCH TOO MEEKBESIDES A DRINK THAT 'S SOFT WILL VERY OFTEN &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; RUIN YOUR TECHNIQUENO YOU CAN NOT MAKE YOUR SHIMMY SHAKE ON TEA . ( Bert goes off . The lights come up on the full stage and The Woman who had been sitting on Belasco 's left comes front and center . She wears a pink frock ) THE WOMAN I 'm Fanny Brice  --  as if you did n't know ! First I 'm supposed to read this cable here . ( She reads ) " ALLOW ME TO JOIN WITH YOU IN MOURNING THETOO-SOON DEATH OF BERT WILLIAMS . I HAVE HADTHE JOYOUS GOOD FORTUNE TO SEE HIM WHEN HEPLAYED IN LONDON AT THE SHAFTESBURY THEATREAND I WISH TO SAY TO THE PUBLIC NOW WHAT ISAID TO HIM FACE TO FACE THEN : ' MR . WILLIAMS , YOU ARE THE GREATEST COMEDIAN I HAVE EVERSEEN  --  WHITE OR BLACK . GENIUS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ puts the cable away ) And you notice who they gave that to to read , huh ? I 've found out in life that the two best ways you can get to know somebody , I 'm talking about really know somebody , is either to sleep with them or to act with them . Well , I never slept with Bert Williams  --  unfortunately  --  but I acted with him and it 's no secret that it was the best work I ever did . He brought things out of other people , things that you did n't even know were there . When he talked to you he really talked to you . When you talked to him , he listened as though he was interested . Sometimes when you do a sketch for the fiftieth or sixtieth time it 's hard , but he always gave the impression that he never heard what you were saying before and that he did n't know what you were going to say next . p. 16 FANNY BRICE ( continued ) He was a joy . Also he was modest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He believed that people came to see the Follies just for the scenery and the legs . He used to say , " I 'm just out there to give the gals time to change . " Was n't true , but that 's what he said . And besides being the greatest comedian , the greatest clown I ever saw , he was a natural musician and a wonderful singer of those great songs of his . There 's no question about him being the greatest comedian , the greatest clown , the greatest pantomimist , storyteller , eccentric dancer , otherwise he was a flop . The first time I saw him he was so funny that I could n't laugh . I was like , well , stunned and I just sat there in awe . It was n't until the second time I saw him that I was able to laugh and the third time I saw him I cried because I realized that I was looking at something , somebody perfect , and I do n't know why it is but when we see something perfect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tears to our eyes . He used to come over to my place sometimes after the show . Remember this would be like two in the morning from The Midnight Frolic , but it did n't matter . I love to cook and Bert loved to eat so we made a great team and we 'd sit there half the night and he would tell all kinds of things that happened to him in his life and one thing I could never understand and that was how he used to take some of the saddest , most cruel , horrible experiences of his life and somehow tell them so that they were funny . ( She moves to the right side of the stage which has become an abstract suggestion of a kitchen and there , with Bert 's help , she prepares a pot roast and a plate of potato pancakes ) p. 17 BERT WILLIAMS What 're you making there , Fan ? FANNY BRICE Potato pancakes . BERT WILLIAMS You mean latkes , do n't you ? ( She pokes him with a serving spoon ) FANNY BRICE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , George and I got off the train in Jackson , Mississippi , because we 'd been booked into the variety theatre there . I was very nicely dressed , but George , of course , he was a real dude . He spent half his money on clothes . We got off the train and about seven of these rough-looking rednecks came over , and the main guy said to us , " What 're you coons doin ' in them clothes ? " We thought the best thing was to jump back on the train but before we could do that these bums surrounded us and they took our clothes right off us , and then they put these two gunnysacks on us and swiped our good clothes and went off . ( He laughs ) FANNY BRICE How can you laugh about a horrible thing like that ? BERT WILLIAMS Because it did n't stop us from getting fifteen hundred dollars a week for the team . ( They go on ) And there was another time even worse . It was when Dr. Clayton told me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clemens , Michigan , for a rest cure . And while I was there they gave me a bicycle and told me to ride out a mile and a mile back . And I 'd almost gotten to the end of the first mile when this fat sheriff came over , his badge hanging out and he said to me , " Where 'd you steal that bicycle , boy ? " And I tried to explain that it was n't mine , that it belonged to the sanitarium , that I was there for the cure , but he would n't listen . He just took the bike away and I had to walk all the way back to the sanitarium . ( He laughs ) p. 18 FANNY BRICE Bert , I do n't know who was the bigger putz , you or that sheriff . BERT WILLIAMS You ever played in London , Fan ? Or any part of England ? FANNY BRICE No . Never . I do n't think they 'd let me . They might not even understand what I was saying . BERT WILLIAMS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Walker and I went over and flopped pretty bad , but then when we had the big hit with IN DAHOMEY the producers insisted that we take it to London . So we thought , what the hell , we 'd give it another chance , and we went . We did n't do all that well until something interesting happened . The little Prince of Wales , he was going to have a birthday and they were trying to think of something special in the way of entertainment . And somebody from the Palace had been to see our show and they thought that would be a big novelty , so we were invited to give what they call a command performance at Buckingham Palace . Well , you never saw such goings-on . They moved the whole show over . The scenery and the costumes and the lights and the whole company and we all went . We went pretty good and the next night , because of all the publicity , you know , we were completely sold out . We stayed sold out the whole time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Fanny speaks to the audience again ) p. 19 FANNY BRICE Modest like I told you . The truth is that they had just become the rage of London . I suppose it was in the end because he had such built-in nobility and comfort and some self-respect . I remember once standing in the wings watching him score like you never saw , every line , every move that he made would bring down the house . And I was standing there watching him along with a dumb dancer named Harry K. Morton . And finally Bert came off the stage . He had to go back and take about four or five bows . He had them cheering . They were just wild about him . So then he started off the stage and as he passed , this guy Morton says to me , " You know , he 's all right , that Williams . He 's a good nigger . He knows his place . " Of course Bert , overheard it , but he never stopped moving and I heard him say , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he knows his place and here it is Dressing Room Number One . " So this nice man King Edward , he grew very fond of Bert and he had him over for small dinner parties , meetings , and all London went crazy over the cakewalk . And one afternoon the King sent for Bert Williams . ( Note : The Protean actor plays King Edward ) KING EDWARD ( Stout , bearded ) Ah Williams ! How good of you to come , old fellow . BERT WILLIAMS Not at all , Your Majesty . I 'm honored. p. 20 KING EDWARD Would you care for a drink ? BERT WILLIAMS No , Your Majesty . KING EDWARD Anything at all Mr. Williams ? BERT WILLIAMS Yes , Your Majesty , I wish you would call me " Bert . " KING EDWARD Very well , Bert , I will if you will call me " Your . " ( They laugh together ) Let me ask you , Bert , in all candor , do you think you could teach me to dance the cakewalk ? Everyone seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like to join in . BERT WILLIAMS ( Looking him over ) Well sir , I know I can teach it to you , but I do n't know if you can learn it . ( King Edward laughs heartily ) KING EDWARD Well then , shall we have a bash ? ( He slips off his jacket , remaining in a red vest ) BERT WILLIAMS ( Troubled ) We 'll need some music . KING EDWARD Nothing simpler . ( He claps his hands . The piano is rolled on . A Pianist takes his place and a trap Drummer sits beside him ) BERT WILLIAMS My gosh , I wonder what would have happened if you 'd clapped your hands six times ? ( And how the scene of Williams teaching King Edward the cakewalk . Awkward at first and clumsy , but in time King Edward gets into the spirit of things and they manage to go clear across the stage and into the wings in triumph . They return sweating and laughing . The two musicians are applauding . King Edward waves them off . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now Bert , you seem to be such a splendid teacher that I am going to impose upon you once again . BERT WILLIAMS Yes sir ? KING EDWARD You will admit that I am an apt pupil . BERT WILLIAMS The best I 've ever had sir . ( King Edward preens ) In fact , the only one . ( They laugh together ) KING EDWARD What I 'm going to ask you to do now has to do with the game of craps . BERT WILLIAMS Craps ? KING EDWARD You are familiar with the game ? BERT WILLIAMS I 've heard of it , yes . KING EDWARD There are , I understand , some fine points ? BERT WILLIAMS Some very fine points , sir . ( King ' Edward takes a gold box from his vest pocket and from the gold box extracts two dice  --  white with diamond markings ) BERT WILLIAMS ( Looking at the dice ) Holy banana peel . KING EDWARD I say , that is splendid . Banana peel . Holy banana peel . p. 22 BERT WILLIAMS I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real diamonds ? KING EDWARD ( Looking at them ) Said to be , yes  --  said to be . Now I believe one must assume the proper posture ? BERT WILLIAMS Down we go . ( King Edward goes to his knees as does Bert ) KING EDWARD Would you say there is any skill involved , or is it entirely a question of chance ? BERT WILLIAMS Chance and cheating sir . KING EDWARD Oh , do teach me to cheat . It would be most amusing . BERT WILLIAMS Not with those dice . I 'll bring you some loaded ones next time . All right , roll ' em . KING EDWARD How ? ( Bert holds out his hand , takes the dice , shakes them , and rolls them , demonstrating ) BERT WILLIAMS Seven come eleven . KING EDWARD Seven come eleven . BERT WILLIAMS Roll dem bones . KING EDWARD Roll dem bones . BERT WILLIAMS Baby needs a new pair of shoes . p. 23 KING EDWARD Baby needs a new pair of shoes . ( Now Bert hands the dice to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Seven come eleven . Roll dem bones . Baby needs a new pair of shoes . ( He shoots . They look ) BERT WILLIAMS Your Highness  --  you just crapped out ! BLACKOUT ( Lights come up full . The large , black Man on Fanny 's left now gets up and comes to stage center . He wears a pink shirt ) THE MAN I am Booker T. Washington . Bert Williams was one of the principal joys of my life . How often we laughed together ! I had heard that he sometimes did imitations of me . And one evening when we were quite alone , I persuaded him to do it for me . He was reluctant but I was insistent . So he did it . I was most assuredly deflated for a time . He had caught all of my little faults and exaggerated them . I am inclined at times to pomposity and verbosity and fancy words . Well , Mr. Williams invented a lot of long words and put them into his portrait of me , and we laughed . Another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that as a negro he was a fraud , having no more than one quarter of negro blood in his veins . And he said , " You suppose if we told that to the Waldorf Astoria they 'd let me have a broom closet ? " p. 24 BOOKER T. WASHINGTON ( continued ) So little is known of Mr. Williams 's history , probably because he was such a private man and seldom talked of himself . ( The projection changes to a photograph of Bert Williams , aged five . OPPOSITE ) He was born in New Providence , Nassau , in the British Bahamas . His grandfather was a white man  --  the Danish and Spanish Consul for the Bahamas , who married a beautiful quadroon there . When Mr. Williams was two years old , his father , Frederick , brought the family to New York . Later , California  --  Riverside , where Mr. Williams was graduated from high school . He went down to Los Angeles and worked as a bellboy at the old Hollenbeck Hotel and went to college at night . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're all fortunate that that idea died away , because if it had n't , who ever could have sung . ( The lights fade and Bert Williams appears in a spot , right .

( He ambles off . The spot dies . Lights return to the stage . Booker T. Washington is still stage center and continues ) p. 25 BOOKER T. WASHINGTON Let me add that during all the years I knew Mr. Williams , I never heard him whine or cry about his color , or about any racial discrimination . He went right on , in season and out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until he reached the top . One thing more and I will have done . When George Walker , his partner , lost his health and for a number of years was unable to appear on the stage  --  Mr. Williams went right on splitting his earnings in half and sending Mr. Walker his share . After some time Mr. Walker objected , but Mr. Williams said , " We 're partners George , " and went on sharing his salary until Mr. Walker died . And after that he provided for the widow . BOOKER T. WASHINGTON ( continued ) I pride myself that I have been of some service to my race , but Bert Williams did more  --  much more . He smiled his way into the heart of America . I 've been obliged to fight my way . Thank you . ( As he returns to his seat , Bert Williams ambles on , cheerfully ) BERT WILLIAMS I ever tell you about my friend Spruce Bigby ? No ? Well , I 'm going to . Somebody once said about Spruce that he was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth a little carelessly . They said that when it came time to feed his hogs he always had to get somebody else to call them . ( He moves , stops ) Man once tried to sell him a trunk . p. 26 SPRUCE Well wha'd'ya ' xpect I want wid a trunk ? THE MAN Why to put your clothes in , of course ! SPRUCE What ? And go naked ? You must think I 'm crazy ! BERT WILLIAMS Somebody got to bragging the other day and saying that he 'd seen a twelve-story building started in St. Louis in one month and finished in the next . SPRUCE Dat ai n't nothin ' . When I was livin ' in Chicago , I 'd be goin ' to work mornin 's and see ' em layin ' de foundations of a buildin ' and when I 'd be comin ' home at night they 'd be puttin ' folks out for back rent . BERT WILLIAMS I was having some buckwheats with him in the diner the other day . SPRUCE Pass the ' lasses . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ molasses . SPRUCE How come I got to say mo ' , I ai n't had none yit ! BERT WILLIAMS And then the time he went looking for work in Chattanooga , and he no sooner got there when he had a letter from his oldest boy , Zekiel . Said , " Evything is all right , only Ma just had a child , but de doctors say there ai n't no danger if we can keep her from havin ' another one tonight . Do n't worry . " Well , he took the first train home and when he got there he found out that the word " child " should have been " chill . " He came home one night much later than usual which was late enough , and he 'd fixed up what he thought was a real good excuse . But when he got home his wife did n't give him a chance to open his mouth . She lit in on him and she gave him the fits . Well , he stood it patiently , went upstairs , she following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She was still going . He went to bed with her still talking , and when he was almost asleep , she was still at it . She was remembering everything he 'd ever done that was wrong . Finally he dropped off to sleep and in the morning , he woke up and she was saying : p. 27 MRS . SPRUCE I sho ' hopes dat all women do n't have to put up wid dis kind of carryin ' on . SPRUCE Honey , is you talkin ' again , or still talkin ' ? BERT WILLIAMS I hardly ever believe the things Spruce Bigby tells me . We got a town nearby here where people do n't talk much . Not even hello or goodbye . They say , ' " lo , " or " bye . " Well , Spruce had to visit over there the other day and he claims this was the conversation he had : SPRUCE Whose house is dat ? NATIVE Mogs . SPRUCE What 's it built of ? NATIVE Logs . SPRUCE What animals you have roun ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of soil ? NATIVE Bogs . SPRUCE How ' bout you climate ? NATIVE Fogs . SPRUCE An ' what you live on , mainly ? NATIVE Hogs . SPRUCE You got any friends ? NATIVE Dogs . p. 28 BERT WILLIAMS You believe that ? I do n't . BERT WILLIAMS ( continuing ) When Spruce came home the other evening , he said to his wife : SPRUCE I ai n't gon na work for old man Grimes no mo ' . MRS . SPRUCE Why ? What 's a matta ? SPRUCE Well , it 's on account of a remark he made today . MRS . SPRUCE What he say ? SPRUCE He say , " Spruce Bigby , you need n't come back to work tomorra or de nex ' day or none of de rest of de days . " An ' I don ' like none of dat kind a hintin ' aroun ' so I just quit . BERT WILLIAMS Spruce asked me to help Zekiel brush up for his school examination , so I asked him : " What is water ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , oxes gin and hydrant gin . BERT WILLIAMS What is lava ? ZEKIEL Lava is what de barber puts on yo ' face . BERT WILLIAMS And what is a blizzard ? ZEKIEL A blizzard is somethin ' on the inside of de chicken . BERT WILLIAMS Who was Noah 's wife ? p. 29 ZEKIEL Joan of Arc . BERT WILLIAMS And do you know the meaning of the word " unaware ? " ZEKIEL Sho ' . It 's what you puts on first and takes off last . BERT WILLIAMS Lies is like a sort of wooden pegs that keeps the world together like a wooden box . They 're neat little things and they 're set into the box so you ca n't see them , but if you take the pegs out the box will fall all to pieces.Two a.m. the other morning I hear a knocking on my door . Put on my bathrobe , slippers , go down and open the door . There 's Spruce Bigby . He walks in  --  no  --  staggers in , says : SPRUCE Let 's have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water . He takes a sip and goes : SPRUCE Weeoh ! Dis is too strong . Put a little water in it ! BERT WILLIAMS So I put some water in the water and now he wants to talk . Well , we sat there about three hours and finally I fell asleep . When I woke up the sun was streaming in and it was morning . Spruce still there . He looks at me and he says : SPRUCE Listen pal , why de hell don ' you go home and let a man git some sleep ? BERT WILLIAMS ( He begins to walk off ) And I was halfway down the block before I realized who and where I was . ( He walks off . Lights come up full on stage . The Man next to Booker T.

But it turned out that he had n't even , been approached . So I asked the Council if they would welcome Williams into Equity if he came , and they were emphatic in saying that they would of course . So I went over to see him at his home up there in Harlem . One hundred and thirty-fifth street . ( As he says this , he moves to the right proscenium .

When I came out of my dressing room I found the stage deserted and dark . The big auditorium was all empty and the strike was on , but I did n't know anything about it  --  I had n't been told . So I went back to my dressing room  --  washed up , dressed . It all seemed like a nightmare . And I went home . But then here in my own home I felt more an outsider than ever . I came in here to this room , closed the door , but I was n't in the reading mood and I asked myself if I had any views about Equity  --  pro and con . And I had .

When George Walker broke down and after a time had to be confined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medical libraries he could and eventually knew as much about George 's troubles as the doctors did . He went to see George every day in that terrible place . One day he looked into a room and saw a man  --  a gaunt man  --  sitting at a table all by himself , playing cards with nobody , and no cards . One of the doctors told Bert that the poor guy had lost everything gambling  --  including his mind . And out of that afternoon came . ( The lights fade .

I 'm impelled to say something that I believe with all my heart . It 's this : That Bert 's sickness and death resulted from the strain of living day after day after day in a world of injustice and cruelty , humiliation and indignities .

And then the two doctors called in a third one  --  a specialist  --  and they had a consultation . Then they told me not to worry  --  that a few weeks of treatment in the hospital would bring him around just fine . But I was n't fooled  --  you do n't share a bed with a man for fourteen years without coming to know him . And I knew that my man was ending . And then that wonderful gifted young lad he discovered  --  his protege , who wrote some of his best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a transfusion and Dr. Clayton stood by . ( Lights fade on the main stage and come up right . Bert Williams is in bed asleep . The little dog lies beside him . Dr. Clayton is watching him . PROTEAN PLAYER , as a black . Lottie steps in ) LOTTIE ( Quietly ) Still sleeping ? THE DOCTOR ( His eyes on Bert ) Best thing in the world for him . LOTTIE ( Watching carefully ) That 's not his breathing , doctor . p. 38 THE DOCTOR Well , the transfusion , it 's a shock to the system . Is n't he fortunate to have such a strong friend with the right blood type ? LOTTIE ( Closing her eyes ) God bless you , Will . ( Bert stirs ) BERT WILLIAMS ( A sleepy mumble )  --  An ' that old Spruce Bigby says . ( He opens his eyes ) Why , hello there , Miss Bernice . ( He touches the dog . Sees Lottie ) And hello there , Miss Lottie . ( He smiles ) Sorry about that billing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? BERT WILLIAMS That 's the question I pay you to answer , doctor . ( All three laugh ) THE DOCTOR The transfusion  --  I believe was most successful . We 'll do another in a day or two . BERT WILLIAMS ( Shaking his head ) Poor Will . He 'll need a couple of transfusions himself if this goes on . ( Doctor Clayton picks up Bert 's wrist , takes his watch out of his vest pocket and checks Bert 's pulse ) THE DOCTOR ( Seriously ) How do you feel ? p. 39 BERT WILLIAMS Well , sir , I 'm bound to say that since the transfusion  --  I feel  --  eighty-percent better . ( The Doctor and Lottie laugh . Bert 's eyes close . And as he stiffens with a spasm , his hand closes hard on the dog 's paw . The dog yelps . Bert lies still . The Doctor , concerned , leans over and puts his head on Bert 's chest . The lights fade and come up on the main stage . Lottie returns to her position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I feel eighty-percent better . " He went out on a joke . I believe he meant to . I suppose a wife may be excused for thinking that her husband is good-looking . I did think my husband was the best looking man I ever saw and I could n't help telling him so . It never made him conceited . Of course , I hated the fact that he always had to appear in burnt cork makeup ; I would have wanted the whole world to see him as he really looked . I loved his hands ; he had the most beautiful hands I ever saw . They were not perfect only to me , but models of them were made by a sculptor we met in England . ( She smiles ) Sometimes when Bert would come home after a visit to the manicurist he 'd hold up his hands to me and say he knew how to make me forget that he was a little late for dinner . He could always charm mother with his hands . And it seems such a pity that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his face , but he had to wear those grotesque cotton gloves as part of his get-up too . And at the end , well , Bert had passed away , and as I stood beside him after the last , I fixed his hands so that they would be seen  --  they were more beautiful than ever . But then the men from the Mason 's Lodge came and they added their Masonic rites . I saw the Masonic gloves and I said , " Oh , please , do n't put those gloves on him . Just once , this last time let his beautiful hands be seen . " But I did n't know , you see , according to the Mason 's ritual , he just had to wear them . ( She shrugs ) I believe he was the first black member of the Masonic Order . He was invited to join  --  not in America  --  but in Edinburgh , Scotland . Thank you .

WASHINGTON Yassuh , judge , dat is so . THE JUDGE Well , for what reason ? Why did n't you speak to her ? BOOKER T. WASHINGTON Well , yo ' honor , I jus ' did n't want to interrupt her . BERT WILLIAMS And speaking of divorce , a while back in some state out West , the courts decided that snoring was good grounds for a divorce . They claim that now that state is run over with schools that guarantee to teach you how to snore . ( A step . A stop ) If a man wakes up late he 's mad ; if he wakes up too early he 's mad ; and if he wakes up on time he 's mad because he ca n't stay in bed no longer .

THENIA Yass 'm and dere 's a little of de bread stuffin ' left from de pork , shall I make some apple sauce outa dat ? ( He moves . Stops ) There is no pleasure in having nothing to do .

Please , ma'am ca n't I have somethin ' to eat ? I 'm starvin ' , nurse ! NURSE Yes , the doctor said you could start taking solids today , but you must begin slowly .

Stops ) BERT WILLIAMS He was walking in the park and all of a sudden he sees three things  --  ( He demonstrates on his fingers ) His wife sitting on a bench , a man sitting next to her , and the man 's arm around her .

BERT WILLIAMS Same day it was storming and raining and the mud was so deep , and he sees a hat out in the middle of the road . So he waded out to get it and when he picked it up , there was a man under it . So he says : p. 45 JACK Hello dere , can I help you out ? THE MAN No tanks , I reckon I can git along all right . I 'm ridin ' a mule . BERT WILLIAMS ( He steps and stops ) THE ANIMAL THAT CAN GET ALONG WITH THE LEAST AMOUNT OF NOURISHMENT IS THE MOTH . HE DO N'T EAT NOTHING BUT HOLES .

" @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stage ) Well , on his way back , the old preacher man got lost in the dark . ( The spotlight changes to an eerie green ) And the wind came up and then the rain and lightning . ( Lightning flashes in the auditorium . And thunder . A crack ! of thunder is heard ) And he walked and walked and then walked some more . And the wind was howling . ( The wind begins to howl ) And then just as he was getting real scared there in the dark and the wind and the rain , way up ahead there , he saw a light . So he ran as fast as he could , stumbling in the mud , but it did n't make no never mind , he got closer and then he saw it was a house , with all the lights on . Just a big old house , out in a big old field  --  no trees , no barns , no lawns , or backyard  --  just a big old house . Got to the porch  --  knocked . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was shivering cold , so he tried the door . Opened . Went in . Beautiful house . Nobody home , but a big fire burning in the fireplace . ( The light of the fireplace is reflected in the center of the green spotlight ) Well , he sat him down to wait . Got out his Bible and started to read him some Revelations . Next thing he saw was a little cat  --  stepped right out of the fireplace . He looked at the cat  --  cat looked at him . Then the cat started in eating the live coals and spitting out sparks as if they were seeds . ( He spits out the sparks as the lightning flashes ) Ol ' preacher man watched and he went back to his Bible . ( He reads , turning the pages slowly ) After a while , another cat comes out of the fireplace . This one about the size of a St. Bernard dog . ( Thunder ) A tough cat , too . You know , the kind that meows out the side of his mouth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Or her . Two cats look at each other . Big cat starts to eat coals , too . Both cats eating , spitting , looking at the preacher . ( The wind howls ) Little cat says to the big cat : p. 46 LITTLE CAT Well , when are we gon na begin ? ( Preacher blinks ) BIG CAT We ca n't do nothin ' ' till Martin comes . ( Preacher reads . He turns the pages faster . Lightning ) BERT WILLIAMS Now comes cat number three out of the fireplace , but this one is about the size of a Shetland pony . ( Thunder ) Eating , spitting . All three . SHETLAND PONY CAT Well , when are we gon na begin ? OTHER TWO CATS ( Together ) We ca n't do nothin ' ' till Martin comes . ( Wind howls ) BERT WILLIAMS Now with this , the ol ' preacher man jumps up . OL ' PREACHER MAN When Martin gits here you tell ' im dat I was here , but I 'm gone ! ( He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of lightning as it follows him . The sound subsides . Lights come up on the stage . The Man on the left of Mrs. Williams now comes front and center . He wears Western clothes and a pink cowboy kerchief around his neck ) THE MAN My name is Will Rogers . ( Applause ) Well  --  ( He scratches his head ) All I know is what I read in the papers  --  and sometimes I 'd rather not know . That one came out a couple of weeks ago said that my friend Bert Williams was dead . I wish they 'd take that one back ; that one was a mistake . Bert and I had a pact  --  shook hands on it . If I went first he was gon na do a cakewalk at my services . Other way around I 'd do some ropin ' at his . ( He glances up ) Here I go , Bert . ( During the following he performs his familiar lariat routine ) There was never a performance of Bert 's that I missed if I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of him from the wings .

A few years ago he and Ziegfeld had a falling out  --  well , everybody in time had a falling out with Ziegfeld . In fact , I never heard tell of anybody who had a falling in with that rascal . p. 47 WILL ROGERS ( continuing ) Anyhow , Bert was not going to be in the Follies of Nineteen-seventeen . And Ziegfeld got the idea that I should go on and do my imitation of Bert that I used to do sometimes at parties at Ziegfeld 's place in The Ansonia . A number of his I particularly liked : " I May Be Crazy But I Ai n't No Fool . " But I said to Ziegfeld , " Now , listen , Flo , it 's one thing to clown around in a living room , but in front of a thousand people ? " He insisted . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him do it a hundred times . " And I had . ( The lights go down on Will Rogers and a spot hits the left wing . Bert Williams appears .

The washcloth will remain , of course , full of the burnt cork ) WILL ROGERS But it was n't any good , that number , and I 'll tell you why . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his moves and expressions .

( The stained makeup towel becomes a kind of banner that Will Rogers waves . All of the participants stand , turn to the screen and begin to sing a chorus of " Nobody " as a montage of all the photographs and drawings we have seen dissolve one into the other on the screen with the addition of five we have never seen before .
