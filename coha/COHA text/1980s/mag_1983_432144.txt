 | THE GRAY WELSH WIND has howled me down from the Hunting Grounds of the Hounds of the King of Hell . Now I rest in a raking rain beneath the Cliff of Gloomy Caves . Below , the stream called Milk Brook flourishes foam white down a secret gorge , cherishing the legend of a gentle saint who once transformed its waters so that a careless milkmaid could refill her toppled pail . I 'm wet and weary , and well content with a day spent wandering on the stormy eastern ramparts of Snowdonia National Park . Celtic legends live in the swirling mist , and there is poetry in the names of things . Meysydd Hela own Brenin Annwn .. . Ogof Ddu . . . Llaethnant . . . . The Welsh words seem an incantation to the past , pleasantly romantic in a land that has a way of upsetting romantic expectations . Wales . The name summons visions of coal miners singing homeward from the pits ; of Druid-drowsy woods and brooding castles , rivers quaint with coracles , seacoasts fraught with fishermen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last bright jewel of King Arthur 's crown , fiercely guarding the ancient language of Britain , yearning still for freedom from Anglo-Saxon tyranny . Well , yes and no . Coal miners sing a muted song nowadays . Only 33 of 214 collieries are active in the famed industrial valleys of the south , kept alive despite losses of more than 175 million dollars last year to preserve 22,800 jobs . Meanwhile , the giant British Steel Corporation imports cheaper coal from Australia and the United States as part of an economy campaign that has eliminated more than 20,000 steel and tinplate jobs since mid1979 . A worldwide recession has helped push total unemployment to 17 percent . But today a tide of economic aid rolls up the Rhondda and Rhymney Valleys and crests at Ebbw Vale , repaying in part the wealth that once flowed down on a torrent of Welsh sweat . Gone are the monstrous and deadly slag heaps , and in their place rise small modern factories designed to liberate Wales from its chronic dependence on mining and molten metal . Cardiff seethes with bureaucrats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investment in commerce and industry . " We 've only one coal miner left , " says Glynne Jones , director of the Rhondda Valley 's famed Pendyrus Male Choir . " It 's factory hands and office workers now . But they can still sing . We 've not been a wealthy people . For generations the only instrument we could afford was the voice . " The voice of Wales speaks mostly English now . Fewer than 20 percent of the country 's 2.8 million citizens can speak Welsh , that eloquent offspring of the Celtic language spoken at King Arthur 's legendary court . For years , ardent Welsh nationalists have battled to restore its health by fostering its use in schools and government offices . In 1979 , after voters crushed a referendum to establish a Welsh assembly with limited home-rule powers , extremist groups in the country began a widespread campaign of arson against English-owned vacation homes . The nationalists redoubled their efforts to win government support for a Welsh-language television channel . Sabotage of transmission towers added a whiff of fear to what was largely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Britain 's commercial television network , the new channel was inaugurated in 1982 with 22 prime-time hours a week broadcast in Welsh , one-third of its programming . " We have three years to prove that Welsh TV can succeed , " said Gwynfor Evans , a nationalist leader who threatened a hunger strike to the death to win the broadcast facility . " But they would n't dare revoke it now . " Politics aside , English-speaking travelers are forced to learn some basic Welsh , since night-riding activists deface English road signs with that mighty modern instrument ,  | the paint spray can . It helps to know that Caerdydd is Cardiff , Yr Wyddfa is Snowdon massif , and cyfleusterau means public conveniences . English Bastards Out is unequivocal , appearing on signs saying Croeso i Gymru , which means Welcome to Wales . The welcome is real . It 's also big business . Last year an estimated 12 million visitors spent more than 800 million dollars , creating some 80,000 vital jobs . Tourists have also created a sort of instant Wales , strewn with graceless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and spills through touristtawdry towns whose castles ? most of them symbols of English conquest ? seem like sugar lumps of history for visitors who like their lessons short and sweet . There 's another Wales , a patient , riverrunning land , whose lofty silences are better found on foot or in the private seasons of the year . It is a land where patriots and scholars strive to link the future to the past . Wynford Vaughan-Thomas is a better guide than most . A well-known television commentator , he is also an authority on  | Welsh history and poetry and literary executor for Dylan Thomas , his boyhood friend . Not long ago he celebrated his 70th birthday with a 242-mile , nine-day walk from Port Talbot to Penmaenmawr . " The center of Wales is almost unknown , except by old shepherds and farmers . It 's a marvelous wilderness , lonely and wild and boggy , the secret of the Welsh soul if you like , " he says . " Much of our poetry springs from love of nature . Our greatest medieval poet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's time . He wrote in a complex vphic . July 1983 The Lyric Land of Wales  | system called cynghanedd , which requires precise ordering of consonants , alliteration , internal rhyme , assonance at special places . It 's disciplined music . Add thought and emotion , and it can be terrifyingly powerful . Translation loses much of the effect , but even so the feeling comes through , like this : Gracing the tide-warmth , this seagull , The snow-semblanced , moon-matcher , The sun-shard and sea-gauntlet Floating , the immaculate loveliness . " Dafydd was something of a ladies ' man as well . I rather like this one : The gentle girl with the golden hair , Golden is the burden that you carry on your head . White is your body , and slim , And you shine with it . What a gift ! " Some of the world 's greatest poetic utterances are found in Welsh . Our problem is that the average man can only take that on trust . For most people , I suppose , Dylan Thomas has become a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means the wild outpourings of the drink , but was based on what he knew of bardic discipline . He spoke no Welsh , but I think his marvelous gift with language came from growing up in the atmosphere of Welsh eloquence . He wrote for the voice . Listen to his records ? And death shall have no dominion ' ? with the voice rising , rising . That harks back to the imagined chants of the bards , a rhythmic spellbinding called the hwyl . The old Methodist preachers were masters of it and could move whole chapels to ecstasy . " Dylan did n't drink so much at home , you know . He would n't have written anything otherwise . It was in London , in New York , that he did his act ? the wild bohemian boy . They clamored for the legend , and Dylan obliged . " The legend 's creator ? and victim ? lies beneath a simple wooden cross ( page 57 ) on the graveyard hill at Laugharne , where his last home was the Boat House , a cottage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an alcoholic in New York City on November 9 , 1953 , suffering an " insult to the brain . " He was 39 . In Laugharne there 's gossip still about his turbulent marriage , and residents are n't always amused if visitors see resemblances to Llareggub , the fictional setting of Under Milk Wood , his bawdy and brilliant comedy of Welsh manners . The name loses something of its charm when spelled the other way round . The Boat House is a shrine now , admission 75 pence . On the shore below , there lies ( or did when I wandered there ) a rusty tin rocking horse , its rider vanished like the poet who once in childhood saw ... spellbound horses walking warm Out of the whinnying green stable On to the fields of praise . Dylan Thomas was born in Swansea , an " ugly , lovely town " that he immortalized in " A Child 's Christmas in Wales " and other stories as a world of uncles and overcoats , smoky streets and brown pubs , dervish snowstorms and pusillanimous cats , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THE VIEW seems instant- II ly familiar from the steep slope of 1 Cwmdonkin Park . Serried rows of chimney pots breathe a homely coal-smoke haze over a bustling and friendly town . Small freighters still traffic in wanderlust at Swansea Docks , and prosperous suburbs sprawl comfortably along a curving shore toward Mumbles Head . Uglier by far but with a gritty energy of their own , indus-trial suburbs crowd along the lower Swansea Valley , once the largest copper-smelting center in the world . Until a decade ago it was a grim junkyard of dead factories and mountainous slag piles , but now the wreckage is nearly gone , revealing 900 acres of prime industrial and recreational land . " It may not seem impressive now , " says chief executive and town clerk Neil Rees , " but grass is growing there for the first time in a century . We hope to see modern factories growing there as well . " A professional city manager , Mr. Rees is chief strategist of a ten-year plan to restore Swansea 's vigor while preserving its charm . An eight-million-dollar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dance hall , and a swimming pool with artificial surf , stands gleaming on waterfront land that has lain mostly derelict since  | bombs destroyed the city 's heart in World War II . Old docks are being converted into a magnificent new marina , and plans call for an 18-million-dollar hotel and conference center surrounded by restaurants and tourist facilities . " We 're financing most of this work ourselves , hoping it will attract private investment , " says Mr. Rees . " This is a doit-yourself town . We do n't just hold our hands out for government grants . " SPECIAL ENERGIES need special nourishment . The people of Swansea get theirs from cockles and laverbread . Cockles are small orange shellfish , slightly rubbery and nutmeat sweet , which shoppers nibble by the bagful . Laverbread , a sinister-looking preparation of boiled seaweed , is traditionally served with bacon and fried bread . Once it was a health food for women whose sweaty labor in tinplate works depleted their iodine , causing goiter . Now it 's a delicacy . " Not any seaweed will do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steaming caldron at the Whiteford Bay Laverbread Factory in Penclawdd . " Porphyra umbilicalis is not as plentiful as it used to be ? there 's not enough to meet the demand . We import it from Scotland and Ireland now , at ? 400 $700 a ton . " Cockles may become a costly delicacy soon . Only three dozen or so Penclawdd villagers still gather them , where once hundreds lived by the ancient time clock of the moon , racing the tide across the shimmering Llanrhidian Sands to rake the shellfish from shallow beds . " We 'll be the last , I think , " says Haydn Williams , 64 , pausing from his labor in an icy autumn dawn . " Youngsters do n't like the working conditions , or the hours . Perhaps someday we 'll import all our cockles from Holland . " Foreign imports are no novelty in Wales . King Arthur himself may have been of Irish descent , for the Irish occupied parts of Wales in the fifth century . Today 's popular vision of The Once and Future King is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ armor of chivalry as a literary legacy of the Norman Conquest of 1066 . But Welshmen need no legend to confirm their warlike heritage . They repulsed Irish attackers , battled marauding Norsemen , and fought the Anglo-Saxons to a standstill along the line of Offa 's Dyke , which after 1,200 years still roughly marks the modern border . The Normans found England ripe for plucking , but it took more than two centuries to subdue the Welsh , who revolutionized medieval European warfare with their deadly longbows . Later , fighting for National Geographic , July 1983  | Edward III of England , they slaughtered the knighthood of France at the 14th-century Battles of Crecy and Poitiers . And in 1485 a Welshman named Henry Tudor seized the crown from Richard III at Bosworth Field . The Arthurian dream came true . With a son of ancient Britain on the throne , England entered an age of glory . In Carmarthen they still honor Sir Rhys ap Thomas , a Welsh knight who helped make it all possible . He led his troops to Henry 's side and ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crown on Henry 's head , an act of questionable chivalry and unquestionable common sense . CHIVALRY WEARS SHIN PADS in Carmarthen nowadays , and very little else . Freezing wind sweeps the battlefield where 15 stalwart members of the Carmarthen Rugby Football Club wage nonstop unarmed combat with a team from Tumble . Tackles are vicious on the iron-hard ground . Eyes are blackened , noses bloodied . There are no time-outs , except to allow one stunned player to totter cross-eyed off the field , take a whiff of smelling salts from the shopping-bag medical kit , and return to battle . Eighty minutes later , Carmarthen has lost , 12-0 . The winners line up and formally applaud the losers off the field , and both teams adjourn to the clubhouse for a dinner prepared by players ' wives , plus liberal liquid first aid . Rugby is a thing of personal and national honor . More than 180 clubs compete in amateur Welsh Rugby Union play , supported only by membership fees . Players must earn the right to play each week . Injuries are shrugged off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The ultimate honor is winning a Welsh Cap , which means selection for the national team and a chance to crush England . " The Saeson Saxons have n't beaten Wales in Cardiff in 20 years , " says Huw Phillips , a Carmarthen rugby committeeman . " They do n't have the stomach for our kind of game . " Carmarthen has its softer side as the hub of a dairy industry that flourishes on the lush pastures of Dyfed County . To the west lies Little England Beyond Wales , where placenames like Fishguard , Milford Haven , and Haverfordwest betray an early history of Norse trade and English settlement . The western peninsula is dominated by Pembrokeshire Coast National Park , which provides 180 miles of spectacular coastal hiking trails from Amroth in the south to Poppit Sands , near Cardigan , in the north ( map , page 42 ) .

With a sculptor 's touch , he cleaves it into thin blue-gray sheets , trims one square , and presents it with a flourish .

Now , only a few score craftsmen keep alive what once was the major industry of northwestern Wales . " I went underground at 16 , " Mr. Evans recounted . " A candle was our only light . We 'd climb up the slate face , 80 feet sometimes , and hang there by a chain wrapped around one leg while we drilled holes for the blasting powder . I might n't have been so brave if there 'd been enough light to see how high I was . " pc .

The sheer drama of Blaenau Ffestiniog 's industrial ruins is matched by the sheer charm of approaching them via the narrowgauge Ffestiniog Railway , whose small steam engines and plush-seated coaches puff and clatter 13 miles uphill from the coast . The line opened in 1836 to haul slates for Porthmadog 's fleet of sturdy 150-ton sailing ships that once plied Europe 's coasts . Now it hauls tourists ? more than 343,000 in 1982 ? plus Sunday surges of local residents who know the bar car is exempt from Sabbath closing laws . Some trips are livelier than others . On a sunny October Sunday , police halt the train to eject a largely incoherent group of students proclaiming an anti-tourist " drink-in " on behalf of the Welsh Language Society . " Students of bloody booze , they are , " growls one bluecoat , and enters the fray with a fluent Welsh war cry .

And myself , soaked in blood , for my song 's sake . Blood for centuries was the badge of Welsh freedom . In about A.D. 400 , while England slowly crumbled beneath AngloSaxon assaults , a Celtic prince named Cunedda left his stronghold near present-day Edinburgh to rid Wales of Irish invaders . He founded a flourishing dynasty in northern Wales , but his homeland eventually fell to northern Irish attackers , the Scotti , from whom Scotland gets its name . Despite frequent fratricidal struggles between Welsh princes , a true British state was born . Poets enriched the language , and Welshmen enjoyed such an enlightened @#  | code of law that wives possessed property rights and could divorce their husbands for causes ranging from infidelity to bad breath .

Their Welsh lands were held by right of conquest , not by royal grant ? a fact that bedeviled England 's monarchs for generations . Powerful enemies created powerful Welsh leaders such as Rhys ap Gruffydd , Llywelyn the Great , and his grandson , Llywelyn II , who successfully unified quarrelsome Celtic princes to mount major assaults on the Anglo-Norman lords , often coming within a historic hairbreadth of forcing England to recognize their sovereignty . The last dramatic revolt under Owain Glyndwr was savagely put down in 1410 ,  | leaving Wales ruined and wretched . Meanwhile the Norman lords took Welsh wives , and their half-Celtic sons were often more hostile to the crown than to their Welsh cousins . FitzGeralds and FitzStephens , eager for conquest , became involved in Ireland 's internal power struggles , and their growing disdain for England 's rulers brought royal retaliation , beginning centuries of Irish agony . Wales became a cockpit of royal politics . Welshmen achieved titles of English nobility , and the Earl of Richmond , Henry Tudor , had a legitimate claim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @# Field to become Henry VII , Wales rejoiced . Welsh aristocracy swarmed to London , luxuriating in newfound power . In 1536 , under Henry VIII , Parliament drew up the Act of Union , which abolished the Welsh nation . It also decreed that " from henceforth , no person or persons that use the Welsh speech or language shall have or enjoy any manner office or fees within this realm of England .... " As England 's power grew , the decline of the Welsh language began . Today , writes R. S. Thomas , one of the most distinguished of his country 's living poets , ...

We 're drowning it in tourism , the ultimate parade of the acquisitive society . The barbarians burst into this beautiful countryside with their transistors and caravans , and we 're convinced we must defer to them .

Interrupting his study of a long computer @#  | printout , he gravely offers hospitality . " It seems we 'll survive , " he says . " But , without the computer I might n't be so sure .

Mr. Jones owns 1,045 acres , mostly mountainside , and grazes 1,050 ewes , 27 rams , and 24 beef cattle . Winters are harsh ? in 1947 he lost two-thirds of his sheep ? and he has ordered four tons of United States-grown corn for $900 , including a 45 percent Common Market import tax .

If earnings fail to provide the equivalent of full-time employment for two men , the government offers incentives for him to amalgamate his farm with a neighbor 's for greater efficiency . " Amalgamation means elimination of families , " Mr. Jones says . " Once there were 110 people in this valley . Only 50 are left . The Welsh language is dying out . Now the government is making a belated effort to save it ? but they did n't succeed in Ireland , did they ? They could teach it in school , but they could n't make it the language of the home .

My father and I had exactly the same measurements as those of the Beaker folk who lived in Wales thousands of years ago ? long before the Celts arrived . " IT 'S A SHORT , sharp walk from the Jones farm to the Cliff of Gloomy Caves , where I began this story near my journey 's end .
