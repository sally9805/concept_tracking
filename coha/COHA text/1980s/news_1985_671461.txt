Included are the " Posthorn " Serenade ( K. 320 ) , with two marches ( K. 335 ) , performed by the Dresden State Orchestra ( 6. 43063 ) ; the piano concertos No. 23 ( K. 488 ) and 26 ( K. 537 ) , with the Concertgebouw Orchestra of Amsterdam , Friedrich Gulda as soloist ( 6. 42970 ) ; Symphonies No. 39 ( K. 543 ) and 29 ( K. 201 ) , again with the Concertgebouw ( 6. 43107 ) , and , on a two-LP set , ( 6. 48219 ) Symphonies No. 38 " Prague " ( K. 504 ) and 41 " Jupiter " ( K. 550 ) , also with the Concertgebouw. // The Serenade is the most successful , a charming , lighthearted piece , set forth with gusto and a healthy , friendly atmosphere . The two marches are neatly dispatched. // The two piano concertos are large-scale readings , though Mr. Gulda ' s playing , on a modern grand , is rather fastidious . He also plays the piano as a continuo instrument when otherwise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be what Mozart did himself , but it doesn ' t seem to make much difference here . No. 23 is bright and perky , but No. 26 , the " Coronation , " is heavily romantic. // The four symphonies are big-band Mozart with a vengeance . Mr. Harnoncourt observes just about every repeat , and his tempos , especially in the " Jupiter " and " Prague , " are rather broad , not to say sleepy , so that the " Jupiter " lasts 41 minutes , spreading over both sides on one LP , as does the " Prague . " Nos. 29 and 39 are a little closer in speed to what we have come to expect , fitting neatly one symphony to a side. // Those seeking a digital " Jupiter " with all the repeats are better advised to get the James Levine-Chicago Symphony version on RCA . Mr. Levine is more muscular than Mr. Harnoncourt , and you get Mozart ' s Symphony No. 40 , also with every repeat , on the overside . A good budget buy for Nos. 38 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one Philips LP , a bright and lively performance recorded in decent , if early , stereo. // Authenticity in music is a rather vague term , but for those interested in recordings played by period instruments , here are some recent releases . From CBS comes a three-LP , digitally recorded set ( I3M 39040 ) of six " Sturm und Drang " symphonies of Haydn . Derek Solomons leads L ' Estro Armonico , a British chamber ensemble he founded in 1973 to perform Vivaldi on original instruments . L ' Estro Armonico has since branched out to include Vivaldi ' s contemporaries and near-contemporaries. // Included are the Symphonies No. 26 ( " Lamentations " ) , 41 , 43 ( " Mercury " ) , 44 ( " Trauer " ) , 48 ( " Maria Theresa " ) and 52 . The set also includes a first recording of the Overture to the opera " Le Piscatrici. " // " Sturm und Drang " means Storm and Stress , a period when Haydn was undergoing an emotional crisis in his personal and artistic life . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with more experimentation and freedom than ever before. // The performances are done with shape and care . Tempos are moderate to lively , phrasing is full of bite and character , and while the actual sound as heard on these disks takes some getting used to , it eventually makes sense ; it ' s softer , less penetrating , more intimate and much clearer than modern practice . Middle A is pitched at 430 cycles , about half a semitone lower than modern pitch , a bit flat for contemporary ears , but probably closer to what was common in Haydn ' s day. // On balance , this set seems to be more suitable for students and historians of music than the general public . Antal Dorati and the Philharmonia Hungarica on London Treasury provide substantially more impact . Mr. Dorati uses a larger orchestra , and if his readings are occasionally brusque , they are much more dramatic and larger in scale . These recordings are those the average collector will take down from his shelf much more often. // More Haydn played on original instruments comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Salomon String Quartet playing the Quartets in F ( Op. 74 , No. 2 ) and G Minor ( Op. 74 , No. 3 ) . These are lovely performances ; firm , bold , and very musical . Again , the sound of the instruments lacks the weight we expect from a contemporary quartet , with a corresponding gain in sweetness , clarity and purity . Fine digital sound with very quiet surfaces. // From Nimbus Records ( 2151/52 ) , another imported British label , we have a two-LP set with Beethoven ' s Fifth Symphony and Third Piano Concerto , both performed on original instruments by the Hanover Band . Mary Verney is the soloist on a restored 1798 Broadwood fortepiano. // The Hanover Band numbers about 40 players , and they are first-rate , but if this is what Beethoven wanted , then we don ' t know Beethoven . True , we get a clarity that is unknown in the modern concert hall , but where is the strength and thrust we associate with Beethoven ? These are neat , clean , sober , sometimes perfunctory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though Caroline Brown is named as artistic director on the program notes . The Fifth Symphony is a reasonably standard performance , with the third-movement repeat observed , but with a lack of profile or personality . The piano sounds positively tinny in the concerto . Beethoven may have composed on the Broadwood , but his vision was much larger. // Warm digital sound , with pitch set at 438 cycles ; again a set mainly for historians and students . For the record collector who wants a Beethoven Fifth he will listen to over and over again , the choice in this corner is Carlos Kleiber and the Vienna Philharmonic , or Herbert Von Karajan and the Berlin Philharmonic , both on DG . Von Karajan ' s 1962 version has been re-released by DG and is a good budget buy. // Finally , from L ' Oiseau Lyre , distributed in this country by London , we have a two-LP set ( 422822-2 ) with Christopher Hogwood playing the Bach French Suites . This may be the most complete French Suites on record , as Mr. Hogwood includes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suites Bach composed for the set and then discarded . The set is characterized by lovely , unaffected , fluent playing , at once sensitive and assured. //
