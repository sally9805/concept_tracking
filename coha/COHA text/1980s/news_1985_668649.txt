Despite confusion about how the U.S. trade embargo against Nicaragua will be applied , government officials and private businessmen here predict that it will have little impact on the Nicaraguan economy . Those most affected , they indicate , may well be the private entrepreneurs who have been the most vocal opponents of the Sandinistas . Though the U.S. does not account for an overwhelming share of the Nicaraguan trade , it is a desirable market because it is close and can afford the shrimp , beef and bananas that are Nicaragua ' s leading exports . Sources in the public and private sectors agreed that Nicaragua could secure new markets for its exports and find alternate sources for almost all the goods it imported from the U.S. They also agreed that the sanctions would make Nicaragua more dependent on the Soviet Union and East Bloc markets and credit . Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega completed a tour of Eastern Europe late last week in which he received pledges of aid , although he and the potential donors declined to give any details . The embargo probably can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably will diminish and the cost of alternative supplies will be higher . Delays in securing delivery of imports from markets farther from Nicaragua also would lead to economic problems , they said . But businessmen say these effects will be minimal because the Nicaraguan economy already is strained . " Of course it will make things more difficult , " said Jaime Bengoechea , president of Nicaragua ' s Industrial Chamber of Commerce and a director of COSEP , a private-sector umbrella group . " If an embargo was applied to Japan , it would put the Japanese in a very bad position . But with this economy ? " He said that the country was so short of foreign exchange for imports and the economy so tightly controlled by the government that things could not get much worse . The embargo will pose specific marketing and logistical problems , said Alejandro Martinez Cuenca , minister for external commerce . " The problem is not markets , " he said . " The problem is not having a market four days away from Nicaragua by boat . " Experts said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut smaller and greener to allow shipment to farther markets . For example , on the day the sanctions took effect , Nicaragua shipped bananas to Belgium . But a price had not been agreed to before the ship left , and Nicaraguan brokers anxiously tried to close a deal as the perishable shipment approached Europe . Bengoechea was skeptical about the government ' s marketing abilities . " You can always get another buyer if you are willing to sell for less , " he said . " That does not take much imagination . What takes imagination is selling in the best market , " he said , referring to the U.S. " Now it means that my people have to be up in the middle of the night talking to Japan and Sweden instead of talking to the United States during the day , " Martinez said . And there are other problems . " In the United States , you eat shrimp without the heads , " he said . " That is a very nice way to eat them , I think . But in Europe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ geared to cutting the heads off . " He also noted that the value of frozen fish was far less than that of fresh and that the proximity to the U.S. had given Nicaragua an advantage in this regard . Alfredo Montealegre Callejas , the president of an agricultural products company that produces flour and pasta here , said that the low-priced East European imports made it impossible for him to compete , especially with the government-mandated prices for raw materials and wages . He showed a visitor a package of Hungarian spaghetti selling in Managua supermarkets for 16 Cordobas , or 57 cents at the official exchange of 28 Cordobas to 1 dollar . He said that the new government-controlled prices for wheat and newly decreed wages meant that a similar product produced by him sells for $1. 42 . " This is crazy , " he said . " You can ' t do business this way . " Montealegre said the ultimate victim of the sanctions would be the private-sector businessmen . " This embargo is not against the government . It is against the private sector that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said , noting the struggle between the government and the private business community since the 1979 revolution . Although the administration announced the sanctions , it has not spelled out how the restrictions would be applied . " We don ' t know if this is a hard embargo , a soft embargo or something in between , " Bengoechea said . The order issued by President Reagan May 7 barred " all imports into the U.S. of Nicaraguan origin ; all exports from the United States of goods to or destined for Nicaragua except for those relating to the domestic resistance . " Martinez , the external commerce minister , said the effect would be slight in part because the U.S. had reduced its level of trade with Nicaragua in recent years . He offered some statistics . He said that at their peak in 1981 , dealings with the U.S. amounted to 30. 4 percent of Nicaragua ' s total trade , but after diversification they accounted for just 17. 5 percent . " It is still an important level , but it is not as important as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollar value of trade between the U.S. and Nicaragua also has dropped considerably since the Sandinistas came to power . According to the U.S. Department of Commerce , the U.S. imported $58 million worth of goods from Nicaragua in 1984 and exported $110 million . In contrast , in 1980 , the U.S. imported $214 million in goods from Nicaragua and exported $247 million . Despite a trend toward greater trade with Eastern Europe , only 19 percent of Nicaragua ' s trade was with the East Bloc in 1984 , Martinez said . Western diplomats estimate that Nicaragua ' s sales to Soviet bloc countries total $260 million a year . Martinez estimated that 12 percent of the goods Nicaragua bought from the U.S. could not be obtained elsewhere . He refused to say what items these were but economic experts said these would almost certainly be specialized parts for Nicaragua ' s single oil refinery and for aging U.S.-made equipment , especially textile machinery acquired decades ago and agricultural machinery . The Nicaraguan economy , mainly agricultural , does not rely on high technology items that would make it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said the sanctions would not block triangular trade , meaning that U.S. firms could export items to a third party , which could sell them to Nicaragua . Nor , apparently , does the trade embargo bar sales by overseas affiliates of U.S. companies .
