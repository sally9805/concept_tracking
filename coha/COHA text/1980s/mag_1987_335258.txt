What 's fashionable and formfitting on the beach this year ? Answer : the rubber look . Robin Piccone , a California designer , has set off a sizzling fashion wave with bathing suits made of neoprene , the synthetic rubber from which scuba-diving wet suits are made . The material is both cool  --  air circulates freely through the fabric 's myriad pores  --  and cosmetic , since it streamlines imperfections on otherwise delectable forms . <P> Body Glove Swimwear , Piccone 's company , has sold more than 33,000 one- and two-piece suits ( priced from $40 to $130 ) in hot pink , fluorescent green and &; other vibrant colors . Top designers like Norma Kamali and Gianfranco Ferre are turning out similar fashions . Coming soon from Body Glove : a line of neoprene car coats and miniskirts.
