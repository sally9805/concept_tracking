NEW YORK  --  Bond prices wound up little changed in sluggish activity . " It was very , very quiet all day , " said Allan R. Leslie , a vice president at Discount Corp. of New York . Bond prices traded in " a very tight range , " he said . " The market is just waiting for direction . " Investors continued to mark time amid confusion about the outlook for the economy and the Federal Reserve System ' s credit policy . Some analysts say the Fed already may be easing credit conditions slightly in an attempt to rejuvenate the economy . Others , though , contend the economy will pick up steam soon , that the Fed hasn ' t changed policy and that it probably won ' t at least until after next month ' s elections . Government economic reports to be released over the next week or so are likely to paint a mixed picture of the economy and inflation . Today , the government is scheduled to release its producer price index for September . The median estimate of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an increase of 0. 3% , the same as in August . But individual estimates vary widely , from a decline of 0. 4% to an increase of 0. 6% . Wednesday , a government report on retail sales probably will show a sharp increase for September , mainly reflecting a surge in automobile sales . Many forecasters estimate a rise of about 3% , compared with a gain of 0. 8% in August . But after excluding auto sales , retail sales probably registered little or no increase , according to these analysts . In the bond markets yesterday , the Treasury ' s 7 1/4% bonds due 2016 closed on some quotation sheets at 95 25/32 to yield 7. 61% . That compared with Wednesday ' s close of 95 23/32 , where the yield was 7. 62% . The government ' s 7 3/8% notes due 1996 rose slightly to 100 15/32 from 100 11/32 , trimming the yield to 7. 30% from 7. 32% . Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. ' s index of long-term Treasury bonds rose 1. 94 points to 1381. 34 . It ranged between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prices also were mostly flat . Rates on short-term Treasury bills were little changed . The latest 13-week bill closed at 5. 06% bid , compared with 5. 05% Wednesday . The bid on the latest 26-week issue also edged upward to 5. 06% from 5. 05% . Investors paid little attention to money supply figures released by the Fed yesterday afternoon . The Fed estimated that the basic money supply , known as M1 , declined $1. 4 billion in the week ended Sept. 29 . That was in line with what most analysts had expected , but it still left M1 far above the Fed ' s target of 3% to 8% growth this year . The Fed estimated M1 averaged a seasonally adjusted $693. 6 billion in the latest week , compared with a revised $695 billion the previous week . The previous week ' s figure was originally estimated at $695. 1 billion . M1 is the total of checking deposits plus cash held by the public . Fed officials have deemphasized the importance of M1 in setting credit policy because they believe it has become an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Fed by banks and savings institutions averaged $364 million a day in the two weeks ended Wednesday . That compared with an average of $412 million in the preceding two-week period . Analysts watch the borrowings figures for clues to changes in Fed policy . The easier Fed policy is , the less that banks have to turn to the Fed for loans to meet their needs . But special factors often cloud the picture over short periods , making it difficult to interpret the Fed ' s intentions . Some Fed-watchers said the latest figures may indicate the Fed has become slightly more generous in providing reserves to banks . But others insisted that the report didn ' t indicate any changes in Fed policy . Whatever the case , the interest rate on federal funds , which are reserves that banks lend each other overnight , averaged 5. 75% in the week ended Wednesday . That was lower than 6. 08% the previous week and was the lowest since an average of 5. 70% set in the week ended Aug. 10 , 1977 . The funds rate yesterday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ session .
