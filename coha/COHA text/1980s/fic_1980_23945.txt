THE ASSEMBLY A short story by Mavis Gallant two weeks in enough . M. Louis Labarri  --  re , author and historian , wife taking the cure at Vichy , said that during the Middle Ages Paris had celebrated 230 religious holidays a year . M. Alberto Minazzoli , industrialist , wife thought to be living in Rome with an actor , said that in his factories strikes had replaced religious feasts . ( All smiled . ) Dr. Edmond Voile , dental surgeon , married , said he had not taken a day off in seven years . Mme. Voile said she believed a wife should never forsake her husband . As a result , she never had a holiday either . Mlle. de Renard 's aunt said it depended on the husband . Some could be left alone for months on end . Others could not . ( No one knew Mlle. de Renard 's aunt 's name . ) M. Alexandre Caisse said they had all been sorry to hear Mlle. de Renard was not feeling well enough to join them . Mlle. de Renard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sedation , in a shuttered room , with cotton stuffed in her ears . The slightest sound made her jump and scream with fright . General Portoret said he was sure a brave woman like Mlle. de Renard would soon be on her feet again . Mme. Berthe Fourneau said it was probably not easy to forget after one had been intimately molested by a stranger . Mlle. de Renard 's aunt said her niece had been molested , but not raped . There was an unpleasant story going around . M. Labarriere had heard screaming , but had supposed it was someone 's radio . M. Minazzoli had heard the man running down five flights of stairs . He had thought it was a child playing tag . Mme. Voile had been the first to arrive on the scene ; she had found Mlle. de Renard , collapsed , on the fifth-floor landing , her purse lying beside her . The man had not been after money . The stranger , described by his victim as French , fair , and blue-eyed , had obviously crept in from the street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vesper service . General Portoret wondered why Mlle. de Renard had not run away the minute she saw him . Mlle. de Renard 's aunt said her niece had been taken by surprise . The man looked respectable . His expression was sympathetic . She thought he had come to the wrong floor . Mme. Berthe Fourneau said the man must have known his victim 's habits . Dr. Voile said this was simply the cunning of the insane . M. Labarriere reminded them that the assault of Mlle. de Renard had been the third in a series : there had been the pots of ivy pilfered from the courtyard , the tramp found asleep in the basement behind the hot-water boiler , and now this . Mme. Berthe Fourneau said no one was safe . 75 Mme. Volle had a chain-bolt on her door . She kept a can of insect spray conveniently placed for counteraggression . M. Alexandre Caisse had a bronze reproduction of The Dying Gaul on a table behind the door . He never answered the door without first getting a good grip around the statue 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been too trusting , even as a child . M. Minazzoli said his door was fully armored . However , the time had come to do something about the door at the entrance to the building . He hoped they would decide , now , once and for all , about putting in an electronic code-lock system . M. Alexandre Caisse said they were here to discuss , not to decide . The law of July 10 , 1965. regulating the administration of cooperatively owned multiple dwellings , was especially strict on the subject of meetings . This was an assembly . M. Minazzoli said one could arrive at a decision at an assembly as well as at a meeting . M. Alexandre Caisse said anyone could get the full text of the law from the building manager , now enjoying a photo safari in Kenya . ( Having said this , M. Caisse closed his eyes . ) Mlle. de Renard 's aunt said she wanted one matter cleared up , and only one : herniece had been molested . She had not been raped . Mme. Berthe Fourneau @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mlle. de Renard 's aunt said her niece had given a coherent account from the beginning , an account from which she had never wavered . The man had thrown her against the wall and perpetrated something she called " an embrace . " Her handbag had fallen during the struggle . He had run away without stopping to pick it up . Dr. Volle said it proved the building was open to madmen . ALEXANDRE CAISSE asked if anyone would like refreshments . He could offer the ladies a choice of tonic . water or bottled lemon soda . The gentlemen might like something stronger . ( All thanked him , but refused . ) M. Minazzoli supposed everyone knew how the electronic code system worked and what it would cost . Mme. Berthe Fourneau asked if it would keep peddlers out . The place was infested with them . Some offered exotic soaps , others ivory trinkets . The peddlers had one thing in common  --  curly black hair . 76 M. Labarriere said the tide of color was rising in Paris . He wondered if anyone had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ section you could count the white faces on one hand . Mme. Voile said it showed the kind of money being made , and by whom . Black , brown , and yellow , said M. Labarriere . He felt like a stranger in his own country . Dr. Voile said France was now a doormat for the riffraff of five continents . M. Alexandre Caisse said the first thing foreigners did was find out how much they could get for free . Then they sent for their families . General Portoret had been told by a nurse that the hospitals were crammed with Africans and Arabs getting free operations . If you had the bad luck to be white and French you could sit in the waiting room while your appendix burst . M. Minazzoli said he had flown his mother to Paris for a serious operation . He had paid every centime himself . His mother had needed to have all her adrenalin taken out . Mme. Voile said when something like that happened there was no such thing as French or foreign  --  there was just grief and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a relative of M. Minazzoli would burden the taxpaying community . M. Minazzoli probably knew something about paying taxes , when it came to that . ( All laughed gently . ) Mlle. de Renard 's aunt said all foreigners were not alike . General Portoret had commanded a regiment of Montagnards forty years before . They had been spunky little chaps , loyal to France . M. Labarriere could not understand why Mlle. de Renard had said her attacker was blue-eyed and fair . Most molested women spoke of " the Mediterranean type . " General Portoret wondered if his Montagnards had kept up their French culture . They had enjoyed the marching songs , swinging happily along to " Sambre et Meuse . " M. Minazzoli said in case anyone did not understand the code-lock system , it was something like a small oblong keyboard . This keyboard , affixed to the entrance of the building just below the buzzer one pressed in order to release the door catch , contained the house code . Mme. Berthe Fourneau asked how the postman was supposed to get in . M. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought a housephone would be better . It was somehow more dignified than all these codes and keyboards . M. Minazzoli said the code system was cheaper and very safe . The door could not be opened unless the caller knew what the code was , say , J-8264 . Mme. Berthe Fourneau hoped for something easier to remember  --  something like A-1111 . M. Labarriere said the Montagnards had undoubtedly lost all trace of French culture . French culture was dying everywhere . By 2500 it would be extinct . M. Minazzoli said the Lycee Chateaubriand was still flourishing in Rome , attended by sons and daughters of the nobility . Mme. Voile had been told that the Lycee Francais in London accepted just anyone now . Mme. Berthe Fourneau 's daughter had spent an anxious au pair season with an English family in the 1950s . They had the curious habit of taking showers together to save hot water . M. Alexandre Caisse said the hot-water meters in the building needed to be checked . His share of costs last year had been enough to cover all the laundry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just above her living room made a rocking sound . Mme. Voile never ran the machine before nine or after five . Mme. Berthe Fourneau had been prevented at nine o'clock at night from hearing the President of the Republic 's television interview about the domestic fuel shortage . M. Minazzoli said he hoped all understood that the security code was not to be mislaid or left around or shared except with a trusted person . No one knew nowadays who might turn out to be a thief . Not one 's friends , certainly , but one knew so little about their children . Mlle. de Renard 's aunt wondered if anyone recalled the old days , when the concierge stayed in her quarters night and day like a watchdog . It had been better than a code . M. Labarriere could remember how when one came in late at night one would call out one 's name . General Portoret , as a young man  --  a young lieutenant , actually  --  had given his name as " Jack the Ripper . " The concierge had made a droll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then . General Portoret said that the next day the concierge had complained to his mother . Dr. Voile envied General Portoret 's generation . Their pleasures had been of a simple nature . They had not required today 's thrills and animation . 77 M. Labarriere knew he was being old-fashioned , but he did object to the modern inaccurate use of animation . Publications from the mayor 's office spoke of " animating " the city . M. Minazzoli could not help asking himself who was paying for these glossy full-color handouts . Dr. Voile thought the mayor was doing a good job . He particularly enjoyed the fireworks . As he never took a holiday the fireworks were about all he had by way of entertainment . M. Labarriere could recall when the statue of the lion in the middle of Place DenfertRochereau had been painted the wrong shade . Everyone had protested . Mlle. de Renard 's aunt had seen it  --  brilliant iridescent coppery paint . M. Labarriere said no , a dull brown . Dr. Voile said that had been under a different administration . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he had said " Jack the Ripper . " Mlle. de Renard 's aunt did not understand why the cost of the electronic code system was to be shared out equally . Large families were more likely to wear out the buttons than a lady living alone . M ALEXANDRE CAISSE said this was an assembly , not a meeting . They were all waiting for the building ? manager to return from Kenya . The first thing M. Caisse intended to have taken up was the cost of hot water . Mlle. de Renard 's aunt reminded M. Caisse that it was her grandfather , founder of a large Right Bank department store , who had built this house in 1899 . M. Labarriere said there had been a seventeenth-century convent on the site . Tearing it down in 1899 had been an act of vandalism that would not be tolerated today . General Portoret 's parents had been among the first tenants . When he was a boy there had been a great flood of water in the basement . When the waters abated the graves of nuns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often wished she were a nun . Peace was all she wanted . ( She looked around threateningly as she said this . ) General Portoret said the bones had been put in large canvas bags and stored in the concierge 's kitchen until a hallowed resting place could be found . M. Labarriere said it was hard not to yearn for the past they were describing . That was because he had no feeling for the future . The final French catastrophe would be about 2080 . General Portoret said he hoped that the last Frenchman to die would not die in vain . M. Alexandre Caisse looked at his watch and said he imagined no one wanted to miss the film on the Third Channel , an early Fernandel . General Portoret asked if it was the one where Fernandel was a private who kept doing all the wrong things . Mme. Voile wondered if her husband 's patients would let him get away for a few days this year . There was always someone to break a front tooth at the last moment . General Portoret was going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pension for twelve years , ever since his wife died . M. Alexandre Caisse said the film would be starting in six minutes . It was not the one about the army ; it was the one where Fernandel played a ladies ' hairdresser . Mlle. de Renard 's aunt planned to take her niece on a cruise to Egypt when she felt strong enough . Mme. Berthe Fourneau and her daughter were traveling to Poland in the footsteps of the Pope . M. Labarriere knew it was dull and old-fashioned of him , but he loved his country and refused to spend any money outside France . M. Minazzoli was taking a close friend to Greece and Yugoslavia . He believed in Europe . M. Alexandre Caisse said sometimes it was hard to get a clear image on the Third Channel . He hoped there would be no interference with the Fernandel , which must be just about starting . Dr. Voile said he was not likely to see that or any other film . He went to bed every night before ten . He rose every morning before six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be quite safe if they left , now , together , in a group . ( He held the door open . ) Mlle. de Renard 's aunt said she thought the assembly had been useful . Her niece would feel reassured . Mme. Berthe Fourneau said perhaps she would not feel impelled to open and close her bedroom shutters the whole time . Mlle. de Renard 's aunt said her niece slept all day . Mme. Berthe Fourneau said yes , but not all night . General Portoret said , After you . M. Labarriere said , Ladies first . ( All said goodbye. ) ? 78
