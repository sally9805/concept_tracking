Noel Koch , a Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense , recently left his Pentagon office toting an overnight bag and rode to Washington 's National Airport . Koch breezed through three airport metal detectors and into the departure lounge . That was as far as he planned to go . Inside his carry-on bag , Koch had concealed a 9-mm handgun that weighs only 23 oz. and is made partly of superhardened plastic . When disassembled , the Austrian-made weapon , known as the Glock 17 , does not look like a firearm . Only its barrel , slide and springs , which are metal , show up on airport scanners . The polymer handgrip , trigger guard and ammunition clip that complete its profile as a gun do not set off the security devices . <P> High-technology weapons have created a terrifying dilemma for airport officials in their war against terrorists . Already , new guns made entirely of plastic are being developed . Easily concealable handguns like the Glock , along with hard-to-detect components for putty-like explosives that are also readily available , give air pirates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Federal Aviation Administration , which oversees domestic airport security , insists that the Glock 17 , which is legally sold in the U.S. , can be detected on existing airport X-ray machines . The gun 's manufacturer attributes Koch 's success in " smuggling " it to human error , not a system deficiency . Firearms are only one of the tools of terrorism that have become more sophisticated . Security devices at airports are intended to spot weapons that could be used by hijackers . But Brian Jenkins , a terrorism expert with the Rand Corp. , a think tank in Santa Monica , Calif. , warns that the machines can not identify bombs like the one planted aboard the TWA plane last week . Says he : " Explosives are made out of organic material . They wo n't set off a metal detector , nor do they have any distinguishing silhouette . It 's a blob and can be of any shape . " A bomb detonator can be as slim as a pencil , and a timer no more conspicuous than a travel alarm . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chemical formulas and take many forms , ranging from string on a package to sheets of paper . For all the refinements in new bombs , he believes , there is still a tried-and-true defense . Says Jenkins : " The best explosive-detection system has four legs and a cold nose . " <P> Israel 's state airline , El Al , which sets the world standard for security , relies mainly on people , rather than machines , to spot danger . El Al 's thoroughness sometimes infuriates passengers , who must endure a check-in ritual that includes hand searches of carry-on luggage , minute scrutiny of passports and rigorous quizzing of passengers about the contents of their luggage . Result : El Al can boast that none of its planes has been hijacked since 1968 . <P> But such counterterror tactics conflict sharply with what one Italian airport official calls the " commercial philosophy " of Western airlines . Says an Interior Ministry official in Rome : " A commercial airport is asked to give tourists a pleasant , welcoming image . Is this consonant with stripping passengers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inconveniences on the ground may be the price that travelers pay for peace of mind in the air .
