If the Cubans do leave Angola in accord with the two-year timetable , and if the recently implemented cease-fire keeps Cubans and South Africans from firing at each other in southern Angola , then the South Africans will have to think seriously about leaving Namibia. // If they really want the Cubans out , they must also stop supplying the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola ( UNITA ) , which has fought a tough guerrilla war against the Soviet-backed government of Angola since 1975 . The Angolans want the US to cease funneling arms to UNITA , too. // // There is pressure on both sides . South Africa is beginning to encounter serious balance-of-payments problems , and the Angolan war and the occupation of Namibia are both substantial drains on South African finances . South Africa for a decade has funded a massive military buildup in Namibia , and also underwrites the regular and the special development budgets of Namibia . It supplies its rail and air services , water and electricity grids , and nearly all of its technical services. // The Angolans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feed and shelter 55 , 000 Cuban soldiers . Nor do the Soviets wish to continue to help the Angolans provide for so many foreign mercenaries. // Angola wants US diplomatic recognition and technical assistance . It wants to develop and modernize a country with riches currently untappable because of war . Moreover , the cease-fire alone will not end warfare in Angola . Quelling UNITA is critical , and only removing South Africa from neighboring Namibia , with its easy access to southern Angola and UNITA , could ensure ( or nearly ensure ) the cutoff of material for UNITA. // All sides want peace and progress in southwest Africa . The Angolans ( and the Soviets ) are desperate for it . The South Africans , however , want peace only if the Cubans leave completely . When that happens , white South Africa will be unchallenged in the southern African region by any military force comparable to its own. // South Africa has long wanted UNITA to run Angola . South Africa ' s financial perils may be serious enough to persuade it to abandon UNITA for freedom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Namibia. // Certainly Namibia is no longer the source of wealth it was once thought to be . Hardly anyone wants its uranium anymore . Its diamonds are still valuable , and probably contribute about a quarter of all public tax revenues . But copper , tin , zinc , and other metals have lost their importance , and the karakul sheep market in West Germany is cyclical and less valuable than it was in the 1970s . Because of overfishing and other environmental problems , the great pilchard runs of the 1960s and ' 70s off Namibia ' s Atlantic coast are gone. // In any event , Walvis Bay , the territory ' s only significant port , is a South African enclave thanks to treaties negotiated more than a century ago. // Namibia ' s real gross national product per head has declined in recent years . Expenses for the territorial government , a set of regional governments , and various local governments have grown as tax revenues have stagnated . Much of the added costs have come from logistical growth as a result of the internal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ African grants have made up the difference. // At least half of Namibia ' s 1. 2 million people are Ovambo , who live in the comparatively well-watered northern eighth of the country and are largely antagonistic to South African occupation . Whites number about 80 , 000 , and Kavango from the north , Herero from the drier center , Damara , from the dry west center , and Nama , Coloreds , and Basters from the dry south all number fewer than 100 , 000 each and make up the bulk of the rest of the population. // South Africa rules Namibia by decree in defiance of the United Nations . In 1915 , South Africa took German South-West Africa from the Germans and governed it as a League of Nations mandate from 1921 to 1946 . After World War II the UN demanded Namibia back , but South Africa refused to recognize the transition from the league to the UN. // Only in 1978 , after American threats , did South Africa agree to negotiate Namibia ' s future with the Western powers on behalf of the UN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have spanned the decade. // South Africa has consistently bargained over Namibia in bad faith . It has tried to foist a home-grown territorial government dominated by local whites and their indigenous black and brown ( Nama , Coloreds , and Basters ) allies on the UN and the West . It has hardly wanted to recognize either the legitimacy or the inevitability of a Namibia ruled by the South-West Africa People ' s Organization ( SWAPO ) , a Soviet-funded guerrilla group with bases in Angola. // Troubles at home , in South Africa , and a shortage of cash may at last have altered this calculus . That is the West ' s and the UN ' s hope . Or has South Africa finally realized that a SWAPO-ruled Namibia would pose no more of a threat to white South Africa than socialist-leaning Zimbabwe ? // After all , Namibia will not suddenly become wealthy . Nor will the South African-dominated economic realities of the region be altered . A new Namibia will be tied in innumerable infrastructural ways to South Africa. // The rulers of South Africa probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ region , and arguably will not come to the new Namibia ' s permanent assistance . Thus , if the Cubans leave Angola , South Africa need not fear an independent Namibia , even under SWAPO and Ovambo sway. // Even more positively , if the white South Africans really see the end of the Cubans and help usher in a free Namibia , they will have a win-win situation . They will spend less on war and on subsidizing Namibia , they will generate at least some world goodwill , they could trade with Angola and Namibia , and they could still dominate southern Africa as the region ' s strongest economic as well as military force. // As peace breaks out around the Gulf and elsewhere in the world , rationality may even prevail along the southern Atlantic shores of Africa. . // //
