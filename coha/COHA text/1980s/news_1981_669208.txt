They had invested heavily in new facilities to turn out over a million sets a year . But not a single one could be sold at home due to government reluctance to approve color broadcasting. // Exports were the only salvation , and even this lifeline began to look horribly fragile when the United States  --  by far the best market  --  suddenly imposed a severe quota system that left Korean assembly lines running at only one-third to one-quarter of capacity. // Take the example of Samsung Electronics , which in 1976 established an integrated factory to produce most of the key components and assemble color televisions at Suweon , some 25 miles south of Seoul. // Its president , Kang Jin Ku , says without hesitation : " Color television production is vitally important to the health and stability of the entire Korean electronics industry , and we are no exception. " // With the domestic market for monochrome television sets having run its course  --  with over 7 million sets in operation , about 90 percent penetration of local house- holds  --  the industry based its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would permit color broadcasting , and that there would be no major hindrance to exports. // Over the past two nail-biting years , it lookd as though the plan had backfired badly . The government continued to be reluctant to give the go-ahead apparently out of concern that color televisions would become an unfortunate symbol of the difference between rich and poor and would undermine efforts to creat a more " austere , " less consumption-oriented Korean life style. // At the same time , the American market that had been expected to take up to 750 , 000 Korean-made sets annually suddenly shrank to just over 200 , 000 as the Carter administration imposed a stiff import quota. // And with the economy suddenly collapsing around their ears at home , the electronics companies found themselves with a domestic sales decline of somewhere around 40 percent last year. // A faint ray of hope occurred on Aug. 1 when the government finally lifted the ban on domestic color TV sales , but that made little impression when it still gave no hint of approving the start of color broadcasts . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was given for a Dec. 1 launch. // The entire electronics industry went from one extreme to the other . Sales zoomed in December to 120 , 000 , stripping shops and warehouses of every available set. // Recalls Deputy Finance Minister Yoong Jung In : " We made an inventory check one day and could only find four sets available for sale anywhere. " // At Samsung it was chaos . Company president Kang says : " We sold 50 , 000 sets in December . But with firm overseas commitments to meet as well we had to turn out 850 , 000 sets in all . Our assembly lines were running flat out almost around the clock. " // The fever lessened in the early part of 1981  --  always an off sales period as families have heavy financial commitments like school bills  --  but there is still optimism of great things ahead. // Mr. Kang describes the industry ' s expectations this way : " We calculate that domestically we can sell as many color as we did black and white sets . . . in other words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million sets a year  --  and that ' s quite feasible  --  then we can achieve our target in seven years . . . by which time the replacement sales will have begun . We shouldn ' t rush too much , though . . . I ' d like to see output for the local market kept at around 1 million. " // Meanwhile , the United States has also partially relented . The Koreans received a new quota in June 1980 that will average at about 450 , 000 sets this year and next . That will represent about half the total Korean exports. // With the future reasonably secured , therefore , the emphasis at Samsung is now on improving technology and overall quality to challenge Japanese domination of world markets. // At Suweon , long lines of young girls and men carefully insert each tiny part into its wooden chassis moving down the assembly lines . Because of the Korean wage structure , it ' s still cheaper to do it by hand than through automation. // But company president Kang knows that the machines will have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get on par with the Japanese on quality control . In a small room at the Suweon plant , an experiment in automated component insertion is now under way using Japanese machinery . The company plans to begin its investment in full automation next year. // But one problem is that foreign electronics firms jealously guard the advanced technology they have developed , so that Samsung feels it will have no alternative but develop its own automated equipment somehow , no matter how long it takes. // The Korean industry already has come a long way since black and white television production was first established with Japanese help 10 years ago. // The Japanese are fast losing interest in this " primitive sector " of electronics , enabling Korea last year to emerge as the world ' s largest exporter of monochrome sets  --  some 5 , 144 , 000 , about one-fifth of the global total. // Total domestic capacity is now some 6. 5 million sets a year spread over eight manufacturers. // Local content long ago reached 100 percent , and the Koreans are now exporting their technology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinks there is still plenty of life in the old dog yet . " We reckon that for at least the next 10 years there is going to be worldwide demand for at least 20 million black and white sets annually . Remember there are still a number of developing countries who haven ' t got television yet. " // The company currently exports about 2 million sets annually , about half of the United States , where at under $100 each they appear to be bought primarily as second or third sets for children ' s rooms. // With the color television breakthrough achieved , the Korean industry is now moving on to video tape recorders , but officials say that although domestic sales have been brisk since they began 18 months ago , the level of available technology is not sufficient to make exports worth the risk of damaging Korea ' s image. // Samsung is now negotiating with the Japan Victor company ( JVC ) in the hope of obtaining its VTR technology under license. // Having suffered a heavy financial blow due to the delay in domestic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generate the sort of profits that will enable manufacturers to plow back capital into research and development and quality control in other areas. // Beginning to feel healthy again , leading companies are hopeful they can gain a niche in world markets with a whole range of house- hold products , particularly microwave ovens ( now beginning to sell well in the US , Central and South America , and parts of Europe ) , washing machines , and refrigerators. // The companies , however , say they have been damaged by government fixed prices for their main lines which , in the words of Samsung ' s Mr. Kang " were not based on cost realities , but only on benefiting consumers. there simply wasn ' t enough profit for the sound growth of the industry. " // But the controls will be lifted in August 1981 , when a new law will permit the industry to set prices on a competitive basis. // Hence , the smiles in the boardrooms of Samsung et al. // //              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
