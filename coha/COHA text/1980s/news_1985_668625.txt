The New York Mets won another battle Tuesday , but lost another warrior . Starting pitcher Calvin Schiraldi was the latest casualty when he suffered a broken toe . But Roger McDowell came on in relief to combine on a three-hitter , and George Foster ' s double capped a two-run fifth inning to help the Mets down the slumping Braves 3-1 at Atlanta . It was the seventh victory in eight games for the Mets , their 11th in 15 outings . It was Atlanta ' s sixth setback in seven games . The two-run fifth off Rick Mahler gave him a second straight loss after a 7-0 start . McDowell ( 3-1 ) replaced Schiraldi with one out in the fifth after Claudell Washington hit his second homer of the year . He went on to pitch 4 2/ 3 perfect innings . Schiraldi had been struck on the right foot by Washington ' s infield single in the first inning . It wasn ' t learned until after the game that Schiraldi had suffered a broken toe . " I know I ' m in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed , " said McDowell . " This has got to be a very enthusiastic performance for me . " McDowell saw action in only three minor league games last year after undergoing surgery to remove bone spurs from his right elbow . Mets ' manager Dave Johnson said he now planned to use McDowell , who has had two starts , in relief . " That way I can use him twice in five days instead of once , " Johnson said . " His ball doesn ' t sink as much after about five innings . He ' s a very important man . " Astros 10 , Expos 0  --  Rookies Ron Mathis ( 2-1 ) and Mark Ross combined on a seven-hitter at Houston and Jerry Mumphrey led a season-high 17-hit attack with three singles and three runs batted in as the Astros won their fourth straight game . " I didn ' t have my best stuff , so I just worked on my location and throwing my fastball for strikes , " said Mathis , who pitched seven innings , allowing five hits while walking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2  --  At San Diego , Andy Hawkins ( 7-0 ) struggled but won again . " I ' m not as good as that 7-0 record , " said Hawkins , who lasted only the required five innings . " I ' m not making many good pitches . I ' m very hittable , but I ' ve got guys back there who can make the plays . " Mark Thurmond gave up two hits for his first save . Giants 3 , Pirates 1  --  Starter Mike Krukow ( 3-2 ) did it all  --  hit two doubles , drove in two runs and pitched a five-hitter  --  at San Francisco . So much for the designated hitter . " We all think we can swing the bats , " said Krukow . " We work hard on our hitting . That ' s what makes this game great . It feels good to contribute that way , too . " Phillies 7 , Reds 1  --  Charlie Hudson , making his first start of the season , pitched a one-hitter through eight innings at Cincinnati , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Felske pulled him for a pinch-hitter with the bases loaded in the ninth inning and the score 4-0 . " Anytime you ' ve got a shutout going  --  not only me , but any pitcher would be upset , " said Hudson ( 1-2 ) . CAPTION : PHOTO : UPI Photo .
