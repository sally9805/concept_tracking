The growing battle over desktop computer standards has turned into a video game . Today , American Telephone &; Telegraph Co. and Sun Microsystems Inc. will demonstrate Open Look , a product aimed at eventually transforming a forbidding operating system for technical computers into a splashy one that ' s user-friendly to ordinary office workers . The so-called graphical-user-interface , designed by Sun with the help of Xerox Corp. , someday will give computers running AT &; Unix operating system much of the snazzy on-screen images and ease of use of Apple Computer Inc. ' s popular Macintosh computer and International Business Machines ' new PS/2 personal computers . It is AT &; bid to make Unix  --  heretofore an arcane operating system  --  and the computers that rely on it , a powerful team to rival personal computers in the office . Open Look is being launched into turbulent waters , however . Last month , Apple sued Microsoft Corp. and Hewlett-Packard Co. , charging infringement of Apple copyrights covering certain visual features that are similar to ones Sun , Xerox and AT &; will incorporate in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ product of AT &; controversial alliance with Sun to streamline and standardize Unix , a joint-effort that has set off howls of protest among many of AT &; biggest Unix customers . Finally , AT &; choice of letting Sun and Xerox design Open Look amounted to giving the cold shoulder to Microsoft , which is helping IBM design a similar graphical user interface for all of its computers , and badly wanted to provide one for Unix as well . " These are very interesting times , " said Richard Shaffer , an industry consultant and analyst who publishes Technologic Computer Letter . " A year ago it seemed that IBM and Microsoft alone would dictate the standards for desktop computers in the office . Now , after Apple ' s lawsuit challenging Microsoft and Sun coming up with Open Look for Unix , we have the possibility of seeing three very competitive standards . " AT &; and Sun are trying to make the most of the announcement  --  and the confusion and interest spawned by the Apple lawsuit  --  by inviting dozens of software companies , chip makers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new , refined Unix . Lotus Development Corp. , maker of the popular personal computer financial spreadsheet program 1-2-3 , and Ashton-Tate Corp. , maker of the Dbase family of database manager programs for personal computers , both are expected to announce their commitment to developing programs to run under Unix and Open Look . Intel Corp. and Motorola Corp. , two chip makers who supply crucial microprocessor chips for Unix computers , have been asked to attend , although it isn ' t clear whether they will show up . Open Look functions as an on-screen operating environment , much like Microsoft ' s Windows for IBM PCs and Apple ' s Finder for the Macintosh , providing a visual " desktop " on which a computer user can view various icons representing documents , files of documents , applications programs , and places to store information . To look at a document or to use , say , a spreadsheet program , a user points to its icon with a cursor , using a hand-held pointing device called a mouse . It is the culmination of work started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mountain View , Calif. - based Sun was looking for a way to make its technical workstations easier to use in hopes of broadening its markets beyond engineers ' workbenches . Last fall , as part of a larger , technology sharing agreement under which AT &; also would license some of Sun ' s computer designs , Sun agreed to help AT &; work on the new , standard version of Unix , complete with a new graphical-user-interface . ( AT &; cemented that relationship in January when it agreed to buy a 20% stake in Sun . ) Initially , Sun and AT &; debated whether to use Sun ' s previous work for the new interface , or to ask Microsoft , which was in the midst of helping IBM , to design a similar interface for Unix . But last fall , Sun signed a similar technology sharing agreement with Xerox , which at its Palo Alto , Calif. , research center in the 1970s invented many of the visual features that Apple , Microsoft and others have incorporated into user interfaces . With access to such expertise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves . " Microsoft is not a happy camper over this , " asserts Mr. Shaffer , the industry analyst , who says that ' s why Microsoft officials will be conspicuously absent at today ' s public announcement of Open Look . ( Mr. Gates and other Microsoft officials weren ' t available to comment . ) " It ' s especially upsetting now that Apple has sued Microsoft , " in an action that , regardless of its merits , makes Windows " look a little bit like tainted goods . " Sources close to Sun say that Microsoft was turned down because of its close ties to IBM . " Polygamy is hard to pull off , and IBM and Microsoft have to have a relatively monogamous relationship , " said a source . While Open Look will give makers of Unix-based computers a better shot at selling to the fast-growing business market , many analysts believe its success in displacing either IBM-compatible or Apple computers in the office is a long shot . For one thing , Open Look is only a prototype now , and won @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And even then , computer users will have to wait for companies like Lotus and Ashton-Tate to write useful programs tuned to run on Unix and Open Look , something neither has done before . In the meantime , IBM and Microsoft are working furiously to finish up OS/2 , a new operating system for more powerful personal computers that will offer much of the flexibility and functionality that Unix promises . And even though OS/2 faces many of the same uncertainties as Unix , Microsoft and IBM have been holding the hands of independent software developers for several years to help them prepare for it , which should make the transition smoother . Plus , there are millions of personal computers already on desktops that , with a few modifications , will be able to run OS/2 programs , compared with fewer than a million Unix machines , thus creating a real incentive for software developers to get moving on OS/2 programs . And then there is Apple , which started the whole user-interface footrace among its competitors with its playful Macintosh " look and feel . " Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operating system next year to make it as powerful as OS/2 and Unix promise to be . One thing Sun and AT &; don ' t think they ' ll have to worry about is a lawsuit from Apple to confuse the issues . The companies took pains to license similar technology from Xerox that Apple licensed and refined in its distinctive interface for the Macintosh . Microsoft , on the other hand , never licensed any of the graphical-user-interface images or ideas developed at Xerox , but instead relied on two rather vague license accords with Apple . " This whole turn of events just shows that OS/2 isn ' t the end of things " in the personal computer business , says Esther Dyson , a computer industry analyst who likens the personal computer business to a card game . " Just when you think someone ' s won the game , another hand shows up and everything gets rearranged . " Credit : Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal
