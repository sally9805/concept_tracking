U.S. CHRONICLES MYSTERY MONEY IT came to light because of a had left turn . This was in Waco , Texas , on a cold night at the end of January in 1977 . At about ten-thirty , a new blue Thunderbird  --  so new that it still had a temporary paper license plate taped on the back win  --  dow  --  stopped at a red light on Valley Mills Drive , a wide double lane domi  --  nated by strip shopping centers and car dealerships and franchise restaurants . The overhead traffic light turned green , and the Thunderbird turned left onto Bosque Boulevard , the driv  --  er apparently not having noticed that a separate light across the intersec  --  tion governed left turns . That light was red . A police cruiser happened to be coming down Valley Mills Drive from the opposite direction , and its driver , a young Waco policeman named Edwin Byford , saw the bad left turn . By-ford signalled the Thun  --  derbird to the curb . There were two teen-age boys inside . The driver , who gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ driver 's license . He was vague about where he lived . Byford radioed for a backup , on the assump  --  tion that he was going to take the boys into custody . Within a few minutes , there were four policemen at the scene , and both of the boys were in hand  --  cuffs . The police thought that the Thunderbird might have been stolen . According to the temporary license , it had been bought that very day in Dal  --  las , ninety miles to the north . The name listed on the license as the buyer did not match the name on either boy 's identification . An identification card shown by the boy in the passenger 's seat said that his name was Percy Garcia and that he lived in Alice ? a South Texas county seat that is four hundred miles from Dallas . The boys were taken to Police Head  --  quarters . The Thunderbird was searched . There remains some dispute about whether it was searched right there on Bosque Boulevard or back at Waco Police Headquarters . There is no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the trunk . The suitcases held four hundred and eighty-two thousand six hundred and sixty-two dollars in cash . The boys said they had found it . For a time , they did n't really offer any further explanation of how they hap  --  pened to come into possession of al  --  most half a million dollars . Then , for a time , the boy who had been driving  --  a fifteen-year-old whose real name turned out to be James Dean Bridges  --  offered too many explanations . Dean ( as he was called ) started by saying that he and Percy were Mafia runners from Chicago heading for a marijuana pickup in Mexico . The Waco police  --  men who were questioning Dean and Percy were not well-travelled men , but they thought it was safe to assume that people hired as runners by the Chicago Mafia are not ordinarily teen-agers with strong Texas accents . The police were also unimpressed by Dean 's story that he and Percy had found the mon  --  ey in an old man 's hack yard in Chicago . Even Dean did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ robbed a train in Georgia . Finally , Dean said that his father was involved in drug-dealing and had buried the money on his ranch , outside Alice . The police found that one rather believable . Dean 's story about his father , being only one more unproved story , was not made public . The early news accounts described the cash in a phrase that stuck with it in the years that followed  --  Mystery Money . There was some speculation in the press about where the money might have come from , but from the start what appealed to the press and to the public was the won  --  drous tale of two breezy Texas boys who happened to run across half a million dollars in cash . The essential elements of that tale were not in dis  --  pute : the boys had unearthed a red ice chest full of money on Dean 's father 's ranch , they had made their way to Dallas by bus , they had handed out several thousand dollars to people who had rendered them a service or told them a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new Thunderbird , and they were on their way to even more fantastic ad  --  ventures when reality intruded in the person of Officer Edwin Byford . The early headlines used phrases like " MYS  --  TERY MONEY BOYS " and " RICH KIDS " and " ROBIN 1100DLIKE EXPLOITS " and " CASH CAPER . " " We started billing it as an adventure from the beginning , " Charles Bar  --  rera , an amiable young lawyer from Alice , who represented Percy Garcia , said recently . " From the be  --  ginning , people were say  --  ing it was a Huck Finn-Tom Sawyer type of ad  --  venture . " Most lawyers in South Texas county seats do not talk about billing except in the sense that bookkeepers might talk about it , but then most lawyers in South Texas county seats have never negotiated movie deals . Within a few days of the bad left turn in Waco , Chuck Barrera and George Shaffer , a Corpus Christi lawyer , who represented Dean , found themselves talking about options and points and control of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , how the adventure would play as a movie was intertwined with how it would play in court . He and Shaffer were contending that if no  --  body came forward to claim the money it belonged to Dean Bridges and Percy Garcia -- a contention that was bound to be tested before a jury . What the boys had going for them , Barrera fig  --  ured , was their appeal as teen-agers on a lark  --  zany , perhaps a bit irresponsi  --  ble , but basically as charming as Huck and Tom . Within a few weeks of the arrest in Waco , Barrera was working closely in Alice with the buyer of the movie option , a man from California named Antonio Santillan , in the hope that the movie would be out before the boys had to argue their case in court . " I wanted the full impact felt by the American public , " he says . " I wanted a swelling of sympathy for these boys . " Barrera believed that there was a natural sympathy not simply for the boys but also for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was based partly on an appealing folk notion that also happens to be a rule of common law ? finders keepers . One argument against the finders ? ? keepers claim was apparent from that first round of questioning at the Waco police station : Can someone be said to have found something if he already knew it was there ? In the questioning in Waco and in later testimony , Dean offered several stories to explain what had inspired him to begin digging pre  --  cisely where he dug  --  in a quail pen not far from the ranch house . He said that he had once seen a shadowy figure burying something there . lie said that he had once helped his father dig up money from the quail pen during a flood , helped dry it out by spreading it all over the kitchen , and then helped rebury it in the ice chest . He said that some chickens he kept in the quail pen had exposed the top of the ice chest while scratching in the earth one day . Dean 's lawyer , George Shaffer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Huck Finn model was accepted . His exchange with a Waco police officer named D. L. Chambers during the taking of Cham  --  bers ' deposition reflected the difference between what the boys ' attorneys saw as the sort of adventure Mark Twain might have written and what the au  --  thorities insisted on treating as grim , unappealing reality . " When young men such as this are on a frolic , they do n't usually tell the exact straight of a tale that they 're telling , do they ? " asked Shaffer , who tends to talk in a down-home , story  --  telling way . " I always did , " Officer Chambers replied . EVENTUALLY , everyone was satisfied that the boys were telling more or less the straight of the tale about the day they unearthed the money . It had started with a long-distance call from Dean to Percy , a good friend from Alice High School . Dean and his fa  --  ther had gone to the quarter-horse races in another part of the state , there had been an argument over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Dean wanted to come home . He needed someone to pick him up at the bus station in Corpus Christi , forty-five miles east of Alice . Percy recruited John Rose , a classmate who had access to a pickup truck . From the bus sta  --  tion , the boys drove to the ranch , and the three of them dug up the ice chest . After Dean got some clothes and a 9-mm. pistol from inside the house and Percy stopped for a couple of suit  --  cases , they were ready to take off . John Rose had decided not to go along , but he agreed to drive Dean and Percy to the bus station . Dean gave him four thousand dollars for his trouble . " He seemed satisfied , " Dean said later . " I was n't stingy with it . " Percy and Dean took the overnight Trailways to Dallas . They checked into the Baker Hotel  --  a large old downtown hotel that had declined somewhat since the days when it could be compared with the Adolphus , a Dallas institution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they headed for Sears . Bluejeans were on sale , and they bought six pairs . They also bought a Polaroid camera and a cassette re  --  corder . Then they started to wrestle with the problem of how two teen  --  agers without a driver 's license be  --  tween them were going to buy a car . That problem was solved during a stop at the Wild West Saloon , a bar on the edge of downtown Dallas . Al  --  though its name and its elaborate neon sign may have made the Wild West sound like one of those theme bars designed for tourists and college kids , it was in fact a dark and unadorned place with a cement floor and a crowd of afternoon drinkers nobody could mistake for fraternity boys . A few of them told Dean and Percy hard-luck stories . " They said they 're just broke , " Dean recalled later . " They 're drinking all their money . Their wives are mad at them . All that stuff . " Dean and Percy handed out a thousand or so . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black man named Gilbert Bai  --  ley . He spoke in an accent that the boys had never heard from any blackman in South Texas , and they remember him as Brazilian , but he might have been from some place like Jamaica or Barbados . Bailey was asked if he would be willing to buy Dean and Percy a car . Apparently , he thought at first that they were joking . Then Percy displayed a wad of cash he had in his boot . Then Dean displayed the 9-nun. pistol . Then the three of them went off to Gus Shaffar Ford . Dean and Percy de  --  cided on a metallic-blue Thunderbird that was on the showroom floor . It did not quite match their standards of flash , but it seemed to be about the best that Gus Shaffar Ford had to offer . Bailey was giv  --  en the money , and the boys waited just outside the showroom . Bailey came out now and then for consultations or for more cash  --  including a couple of thousand for him to keep . It took less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and drive the Thunder  --  bird out of the show  --  room . Just outside , Percy and Dean hopped in . In the years since , some people have ex  --  pressed amazement that a young man with a foreign accent , in constant con  --  sultation with two teen-agers who were loitering just outside , could peel off hundred-dollar bills for a new Thunderbird and drive it away with  --  out any questions being asked . Dean , for one , saw nothing remarkable about it . " If you got money , they do n't ask nothing , " he said recently . " They just give you the receipt . " During another stop at Sears , the boys ditched Bailey and headed for 1-35 . " We were just going up North , " Dean said not long ago . " I had never been up there . " The specific destination that Dean had in mind was Chicago . " ' That 's as far north as you could go , " he explained later . " There were a lot of places I planned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1-35 interchange was confusing  --  what Dean has described as " a spaghetti bowl . " Dean headed the Thunderbird in the wrong direction  --  not north toward Chicago and its Mafia runners but south toward Waco , a city known in Texas for Baylor University and for a strict interpretation of how Southern Baptists are supposed to behave in or  --  der to stay right with their God . Dean says that they got faulty directions . One lawyer who has worked on the Mystery Money case and treasures it partly for its entertainment value likes to think that the Thunderbird 's route was set by a higher authority . " Ca n't you just see it ? " he said recently . " Retribution ! I like to think that God just took that car and turned it right around . Right around toward of all places  --  Waco . " TN Alice , about the only thing any- . / one found mysterious about the Mystery Money was whose drug haul it was . Alice , the seat of Jim Wells County , is a city of twenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Except for a couple of large , modern bank headquarters , its commercial district consists of a quiet downtown of one-story buildings and a long , franchise-clogged double lane heading east toward Corpus . From the air , it must look like a sleepy beast with a neon tail . Alice was named after the daughter of a founder of the King Ranch , which is nearby , but since the thirties its economy has cen  --  tered on oil and gas rather than cattle . Its chief annual event is not a rodeo but the Southwest Energy Exposition . Alice has sometimes been known as the Hub City of South Texas . It lies squarely on Highway 281 , where traf  --  fic comes straight north from the Mexican border , an hour and a half away , and either continues toward San Antonio or branches off to Corpus Christi . By the time Dean and Percy were stopped for the bad left turn in Waco , some people in Texas had started referring to Highway 281 as Marijuana Alley . Alice never acquired the sort of reputation that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where manifestations of unex  --  plained wealth became practically a tourist attraction several years ago . Still , a resident who has kept his eyes open can point out an impressive house or two that is , as they say in South Texas , " made out of drugs . " Even a resident who had n't been paying much attention would n't have had much doubt about what sort of business pro THE NEW YORKER 43 duced an ice chest full of cash buried on a rather remote ranch a few miles from Highway 281 . Alice is not the easiest place to sell the romance of a teen-age frolic . In South Texas , a. lot of people seem to assume a base and probably corrupt motive for almost any human act , and history has tended to bear them out . Jim Wells County , in fact , has a se  --  cure place in the sort of political lore that makes South Texas long on cyn  --  ics . In the primary election of 1948 ? or , to put it more precisely , somewhat after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  Jim Wells County produced the famous Box 13 , which contained just enough votes to elect Lyndon Johnson a United States senator , and to earn him the name Landslide Lyndon . Only ten miles west of Alice is San Diego , the seat of Duval County  --  once the headquarters of a political boss known as the Duke of Duval , whose exploits included a bitter struggle to add Jim Wells County to his duchy . The Duke 's ma  --  chine is no longer intact  --  the Duke , George Parr , shot himself in 1975 ? but people in Alice still sometimes re  --  fer to San Diego as being " behind the mesquite curtain . " The whole area has a reputation for producing political  --  cians whose rascality and ferocity could drive a Chicago alderman into the arms of the reformers . South Texas is the sort of place where a lawman who did n't arrest a lot of drug dealers might be assumed to be on the take and where a lawman who was particularly zealous about drug arrests might be assumed to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When a woman who has lived in Alice for some years was asked recently why the sheriff who was in office at the time of the Mystery Money made so many arrests of people carting drugs through Jim Wells County on Highway 281 , she said , without hesitation , " He wanted their cars . " It is true that the sheriff and a former district attorney and several others were indicted for giving the confiscated cars to friends and political supporters . The charges were dropped when the sheriff announced his resig  --  nation for reasons of health , though , and it was widely noted in Jim Wells County that the former district attor  --  ney involved had once helped indict the county judge . One citizen summed up the entire incident for a visiting reporter from the Dallas Times Her  --  ald as " just politics . " The Garcias were well known in Alice . Percy 's father had retired as a postman and got work as a security guard . One of Percy 's uncles was a justice of the peace . Although the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " the description must have been inspired more by his name than by his appearance . He has green eyes and brown hair  --  his mother is only half Mexican-American  --  and he un  --  derstands Spanish a lot better than he speaks it . In 1977 , Percy Garcia was a fairly cheerful sixteen-year-old  --  a husky boy whose main interest in school was the prospect of making the baseball team  --  but nobody in Alice ever mistook him for Huck Finn . As Barrera sometimes puts it , " the boys were not model students . " In school , Percy had disciplinary problems . When the Waco police noticed a bulge in Percy 's clothing during question  --  ing , they discovered that he had stuffed into his pants a plastic bag that contained not only seven thousand dollars but an ounce and a half of marijuana . " Why did you have the marijuana ? " George Shaffer later asked Percy in court . " Just a habit , I guess , " Percy said . Dean was not as well known around town . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stepfather . He carried his stepfather 's surname , through adoption . When he was thir  --  teen , though , he had decided that he wanted to live with his natural fa  --  ther , James Hiroms , who was a sheet-metal worker by trade . A year or so later , he and his father moved to the ranch near Alice . Hiroms kept some cattle and had a feed store in Corpus and owned some quarter horses . In South Texas , a sheet-metal worker with enough capital to buy a store or a ranch or some quarter horses may raise some suspicion about the true source of his income . Those who were suspicious of James Hiroms felt their suspicions confirmed when he made no claim for the money found on his ranch and went to jail briefly rather than answer a grand jury 's questions about it . THE City of Waco found that having nearly five hundred thou  --  sand dollars in cash was a burden . The money had to he kept somewhere . It had to he guarded . It represented a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was sued for giving it to the wrong parties . A lot of parties were asking for it . Dean and Percy , of course , said that it belonged to them . THE NEW YORKER The State of Texas said that it would claim the cash under the laws of es  --  cheat , by which property or money that has no legal owner reverts to the state after seven years . McLennan County , of which Waco is the seat , put in a claim under a Texas provision that awards counties any unclaimed property seized by a state or county police officer  --  a provision that lawyers familiar with the case tended to think of as considerably less compelling than the one relied on by the state . Early in the interrogation of Dean and Percy at the Waco police station , the po  --  lice questioners had been joined by two men from the Internal Revenue Service , and within a few days the I.R.S. had notified both Waco and the boys that the federal government con  --  sidered itself entitled to a large chunk of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money  --  a decision that still puzzles some of the lawyers connected with the case . " We could not figure out anything that would give us a right to it , " the city attorney said recently . In an effort to free itself from the prob  --  lems and expense involved in holding the stakes , the city interpleaded the Mystery Money into state court  --  a legal procedure by which a party can simply hand money over to a court and ask the judge to assume the responsi  --  bility of deciding who should have it . The presence of the I.R.S. caused the case to be removed to federal court , and lawyers began the depositions and motions and discoveries leading up to a trial . A lot of people who had read about the Mystery Money did n't think a trial was necessary . Felipe Reyna , who , as McLennan County district attorney , made the decision to claim the money for the county , has said that his decision was unpopular not only because some people considered the county 's legal argument farfetched but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these two chil  --  dren . " That was precisely the sort of thinking that Chuck Barrera hoped to encourage  --  with the help of Antonio Santillan , who had flown from Cali  --  fornia to South Texas as soon as the movie deal was made . In Alice , Santi  --  llan struck everyone as a perfect Holly  --  wood type  --  curly hair , designer jeans , and big plans . He spent hours at the Sheraton Marina , in Corpus Christi , with Dean and Percy , taping their recollections . He scouted locations in Alice . He held a news conference at the Sheraton , announcing that the film , which he intended to call " Find  --  ers , Weepers , " would be a modern Huckleberry Finn story although , he reminded the press , " this is another century and the values are different . " The Alice Echo 's coverage of the news conference ran under the banner headline " HUB CITY HOLLYWOOD . " One place that did not make Sandi-Ian welcome in his search for locations was Alice High School . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the authorities were not looking forward to their return . There had been no serious criminal charges brought against the boys in connection with the Mystery Money . Percy later pleaded guilty to a misde  --  meanor for the marijuana . Dean was acquitted on the charge of carrying a pistol : in Texas , a bona-fide traveller is permitted to carry a weapon  --  even a bona-fide traveller who happens to be travelling in the wrong direction . Still , Alice High School had a mari ? juana problem at the time , and nobody thought that it would be helped by folk heroes who had become famous through suspicious money . As it turned out , there was no need to worry about Dean ; he did n't return to Alice . He went straight from Waco to his mother 's house  --  his experience of liv  --  ing with his natural father at an end . Percy was in and out of school for a few weeks after he got hack from Waco . The school authorities , who had found him enough of a problem before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to Barrera at one point as " a major disruptive element . " Eventually , he went to live with an uncle in California , where he attended school for a few months and then dropped out for good . Dean also had trouble becoming a student again . He tried three or four schools around Corpus ; he says the principals tended to complain that his notoriety was a disturbance . " Finally , " he said recent ly , " I just gave up and went to the oil fields . " Percy did the same . By the time the trial finally came up , in United States District Court , in Waco  --  in March of 1981 , four years after the had left turn on Valley Mills Drive  --  both Dean and Percy were working as roughnecks on rigs drilling for oil and gas in South Texas . By then , it had been clear for some time that the movie was not going to he released before the trial . A screen  --  play had been written , and a copy of it had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ announcement that the movie would be called " Finders , Weepers , " the screenplay told a tale with a happy ending : the boys get the money , Dean decides to go to college , Percy accepts an offer from the New York Yankees for a tryout , and they drive away from the bank in a Rolls-Royce . After a while , though , Santillan was being heard from less and less ; eventually , Barrera could n't find him at all . There had been another development that made Dean and Percy look a hit less like Mark Twain characters , even under the Santillan definition that al  --  lowed for different values in differ  --  ent centuries . A year or so after the Mystery Money turned up in Waco , Dean 's father , James Hiroms , had been arrested for possession of mari  --  juana with intent to distribute . In No  --  vember of 1978 , he had pleaded guilty and had been sentenced to five years in the federal penitentiary . There was no evidence that the Mystery Money was involved , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of money it was . Even after the Hiroms arrest , lawyers for the boys were optimistic . Still , Shaffer and Barrera explored the possibility of making some sort of out  --  of-court settlement that would divide the money among the boys and the state and , of course , the I.R.S. The state was not interested . DAVID BRAGG and Roy Smithers got involved with the Mystery Money through what lawyers in the white-collar-crime di  --  vision of the Texas at  --  torney general 's office referred to as the I.C.B. ? the Interest  --  ing Case Bureau . Bragg , a former Peace Corps volunteer , and Smithers , a former F.B.I . agent , were part of a group of high-spirited young attor  --  neys who had gone to work in Austin for a reformist attorney general named John Hill . They tended to vary the routine of the caseload now and then with a case that involved , say , Gypsy scams or a perpetual-motion machine . " We got involved in a lot of wild stuff in the I.C.B. , " Bragg said recently . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Bragg and Smithers figured that they had two tasks . They had to estab  --  lish that Dean and Percy knew whose money it was the legal principle be ing , roughly , that if you find a ten-dollar bill on the ground it 's finders keepers but if you saw it drop out of somebody 's pocket other rules apply . They also had to rub some of the Huck Finn mystique off Dean Bridges and Percy Garcia . Bragg and Smithers shared Barrera 's belief that the im  --  pression the jurors had of the boys would go a long way toward deciding the verdict . When they thought of the prospective juror they would absolute  --  ly have to challenge , they were think  --  ing of the prospective juror Barrera envisioned as ideal  --  a middle-aged woman who seemed motherly . Bragg and Smithers knew how far behind they were in the public-relations battle when they drove into Waco for the trial . " We stopped at a filling station , " Bragg has said . " And this man said , What in the hell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these poor boys ? ' We were even greater ogres than the I.R.S. " When the trial began , before United States District Judge Fred Shannon , fifteen lawyers were listed as appearing for one side or another . Be  --  fore anything else could be decided , there was considerable colloquy about where all of them would sit . It ended with Shaffer and Barrera and their associates as counsel for the boys being joined at one table by a rather reluc  --  tant ally  --  the attorney for the Inter  --  nal Revenue Service . The I.R.S. man was still making his discomfort known when he delivered his closing remarks to the jury ( " The United States is not a party to this action because we be  --  lieve that Dean Bridges and Percy Garcia are the most deserving children in the world " ) , but there was no way to get around the fact that the I.R.S. could get a share of the money only if it went to taxpayers , and the only po  --  tential taxpayers in sight were Dean Bridges and Percy Garcia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a matter of trying to capture the moral high ground , was delighted by the seating arrangement . " There was a great advantage in having the I.R.S. sitting with them , " he has said . " Wherever the I.R.S. is present , you get this overwhelming sense of greed . " George Shaffer , a portly man with the courtroom style of an old-fash ioned Texas stem-winder , was confi dent from the start that the boys would get the money . Even before the argument ment about seating had ended , he summed up his case : " The money be longs to us unless and until the State can show that it does not belong to us . I think that is foregone . " The way the state hoped to show this was to dem onstrate that the money was not found but stolen : it is a rule of law that title can not be acquired by theft . Judge Shannon ruled that the search-and seizure question  --  the question of whether the police had turned up the money in an illegal search and there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was indeed stolen money  --  would be argued after the jury had been dis missed . What the jury would be asked to decide was whether Dean Bridges had taken the money even though he knew or believed that its owner could be found . " The essential question , " the Judge told the jury , " is whether or not it was found innocently or whether or not the money was stolen . " The case against Dean and Percy was argued mainly by David Bragg . - with Roy Smithers vetting the perfor mance and the McLennan County lawyers coming in with a few ques tions of their own before each witness left the stand . " Our testimony will show that Dean Bridges be lieves that money to be drug money , " Bragg told the jurors . Dean had dug up the mon ey to get back at his fa ther , Bragg said ; the trip north was no teen age frolic but Dean 's attempt to put as many miles as possible between himself and Alice before the hole in the quail pen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attor  --  neys for the boys argued in reply , why had n't the authorities indicted anyone for stealing it ? If it was stolen , whom was it stolen from ? Nobody had come forward to claim the money , the law  --  yers said , and nobody had reported it missing . The boys had found it . Find  --  ers keepers . There was no escaping the fact that Dean 's statements about the or  --  igin of the cash had been , as his lawyers put it , inconsistent . ( The Corpus Christi Caller headlined one day of its trial coverage " YOUTH GIVES FOURTH VERSION OF HOW HE FOUND MYSTERY CASH . " ) According to the lawyers , such inconsistency was understandable in a frightened fifteen-year-old boy who had been questioned relentlessly by police and federal agents . The statement of Dean 's that seemed most damaging to his case , though , had been made sever  --  al months after his interrogation at Waco Police Headquarters  --  volunta  --  rily and upon advice of counsel . It was a document called a petition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States Tax Court . In that document , which was introduced into evidence by the state , Dean and a cer  --  tified public accountant representing him attested that the money had been stolen . Why had Dean been advised to make such a statement ? The answer seemed to astound even the Judge : to get a tax break . An accountant had advised Shaffer that stolen money would be taxed at a lower rate than found money , since it was earned rather than unearned income . At the time the document was filed , Shaffer had been certain that there would be no criminal indictment for theft , since an indictment would have required a victim . He had assumed that a tax document would not be brought into evidence . He had been confident that Dean and Percy were going to keep the money . Why not keep sixty thou  --  sand dollars more of it by declaring it as earned income ? The concept had Judge Shannon shaking his head in wonderment . " Am I to understand , " he said , " that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than a guy who finds the money ? You get a tax hreak for steal  --  ing instead of finding ? Is that the deal ? Is that what the law of this country says ? " " The cases have said if a person is in the business of being a thief that is earned income , " the attorney for the I.R.S. replied . Despite Dean 's inconsistencies , he struck Bragg as an effective witness an obviously unschooled but obviously shrewd young cutup who came across as a rather charming underdog . After the first day of Dean 's testimony , in fact , Bragg was pessimistic about be ing able to change the jury 's natural in clination to favor a couple of teen-age boys over the faceless forces of government . Then Dean made an error . He denied that he had ever been arrested on a drug charge in Duval County . Bragg sent a state plane to pick up the record of a marijuana ar rest , had the court reporter type up Dean 's testimony overnight , and confronted Dean with the dispari @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Judge had to give Dean a warning on the penalties for perjury . Dean changed his testimony . For Bragg , the incident helped crystallize the morality play he was trying to stage . " We tried to show through police testimony and the other people we called to testify that those people we normally associate with right and good are all on this side of the case and those we associate with bad are on the other side , " he has said . " Once he got on the stand and lied , all these little things fell into place . " Dean would presumably disagree with Bragg 's characterization of his testi  --  mony : when he was asked by Bragg if he had lied in the document sent to the Tax Court , Dean said , " I did n't tell no lie . . . I just did n't tell the truth . " By then , even Shaffer must have been feeling less confident . His sum  --  mation to the jury , though , was re  --  strained only in the way that connois @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ define restraint : " He did n't mention the Alamo but once . " Shaffer told the jurors that they were the buffer between the power of the government and a simple citizen . " Your destiny , whether it was prede  --  termined millions of years ago or yes  --  terday , your destiny is to sit in this case and be the buffer , the force be  --  yond which the State or the power must go before these two young men , particularly Dean Bridges , may be called , ridiculed , and stated to he a common thief , " Shaffer said " Now , you do n't really realize the power of the State until you are up against a large tree or until you are in a rowboat in the middle of the gulf or the bay at the time of a great storm , such as Celia . It is almost like the depth of space . Our mind is not quite big enough to comprehend the largeness , the hugeness of it . It is so powerful that one person can not overcome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oars in the storm for these young boys in this particular case . This is a death struggle  --  no more , no less  --  between two young men and the power of the State . They are struggling , and their struggle will probably terminate today just like it did several years ago with the Alamo . " That 's what happened . The jury took an hour and twenty minutes to return with the finding that the Mys  --  tery Money had been stolen . The next day , after hearing more testimony , Judge Shannon ruled that the money could not be returned to the boys on the ground that it had been illegally seized . He asked for briefs on whether the cash should go to the state or to McLennan County or he split between them . Lawyers for Dean and Percy said they would appeal . Barrera had admired Bragg 's courtroom perfor  --  mance , but he thought the authorities had flimflammed the boys out of the money by reaching what amounted to a criminal verdict through a civil case ? without having to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  nal-case rules of evidence . The way George Shaffer put it some time later was this : " They were willing to brand these boys as thieves in order to get their unclean clutches on the money . " ACOUPLE of weeks after the trial , a small caravan proceeded down 1-35 from Waco to Austin . A delegation from McLennan County was going to the capital to talk to state authorities about dividing up the Mys  --  tery Money . Briefs would have to be submitted to the court , of course , but the understanding of the lawyers in the case was that the state and the county could work out some sort of settlement and present it in a legal form that would withstand an appeal . The county judge an administrative as well as a judicial official in Texas  --  was in the McLennan County delega  --  tion , and so were a couple of county commissioners . Two or three people from the McLennan County district attorney 's office were along . The meeting was in a large conference room on the seventh floor of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then , the attor  --  ney general was Mark White , a Bay  --  lor graduate , who was already seen as THE NEW YORKER a candidate for governor . White and a couple of his deputies were present . So were David Bragg and Roy Smithers . Bragg and Smithers knew there was going to be trouble , they recalled re  --  cently , when the county people began by saying , " Mark , we certainly appre  --  ciate the help you gave us in this case . " Bragg and Smithers had been under the impression that they had won the case , and won it for the state . It soon became apparent , though , that the money was going to the county . Bragg and Smithers interpreted the decision as a sort of political pork bar  --  rel . The phrases that stick in their minds when they think back on what the McLennan County people said have to do with how badly the folks in McLennan County needed a new jail and how much the folks in McLennan County would like to see Mark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ county judge interprets the meeting differently . If money is ac  --  quired through the criminal-justice system , he says , it seems perfectly reasonable to use it to support the criminal-justice system , and most of the burden of doing that falls on the county  --  including , as it happened , the necessity around that time of building a new jail to meet a new set of stan  --  dards imposed by the state . According to a spokesman for Mark White , the decision that McLennan County should get the money was based on such considerations as the fact that the arrest had been made by local rather than state law officers and the expecta  --  tion that the county could begin mak  --  ing use of the money without waiting the seven-year period required by the escheat law . Whatever the motive for White 's decision , it was a matter of policy rather than of law . Bragg and Smithers did not feel they could write briefs that did not strongly support the argument they had already pre  --  sented in court , and they asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assigned to write the briefs . A year later , in early 1982 , Judge Shannon awarded all the money to McLennan County . THE lawyers for Dean and Percy thought that their best chance for a reversal by the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals was on the issue of search and seizure . The Fifth Circuit ruled that the constitutional guaran  --  tees against illegal search and seizure were meant to prevent tainted evidence from being used to convict a defendant in a criminal case , and were not relevant in a civil case . The Fifth Cir  --  cuit 's decision was appealed to the Su  --  preme Court , but in February of 1984 the Supreme Court announced that it would not hear the case . Seven years after it began , the legal struggle for the Mystery Money was over . After collecting interest in Waco banks for seven years , the money amounted to eight hundred and sixty-five thousand four hundred and sixty dollars . Percy Garcia 's mother was quoted in the newspaper as saying that she had been praying that Percy would n't be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young and I was afraid that he was going to mess up his life . " She said , " If the county needs it more than Percy does , they can have it . " ( " I saw her praying in the courtroom , " Chuck Barrera said when he heard about that comment , " but I thought she was praying for us to win . " ) George Shaffer was not feeling as magnanimous as Mrs. Garcia . " I am going to try to find out how McLen  --  nan County could steal all that mon  --  ey , " he told a reporter , " because in my judgment that is what they did . " Oddly , a lot of people in McLennan County seemed to agree . Given their reputation for straitlaced Baptist mo  --  rality , residents of Waco might have been expected to approve a decision that a couple of boys who had trouble telling the same story twice could not keep a treasure they had not earned . Given the normal complaints about the taxpayer 's burden , McLennan County @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the news that an extra nine hundred thousand dollars had been thrown into the county 's kitty . But every time the case was prominently mentioned in the Waco Tribune-Herald half a dozen citizens sent in angry letters accusing the county of having stolen the money from the boys . Nobody has ever writ  --  ten a letter to the editor on the other side . Instead of being thanked for hav  --  ing captured the money for the county on a long shot , county officials have been accused of bullying and " the most hideous attitude of petty jealousy . " Af  --  ter the Supreme Court decision , a Tribune-Herald editorial that sup  --  ported the county 's actions as perfect  --  ly proper acknowledged that " the crit  --  ics who have called county officials thieves over the past six years wo n't stop just because the highest court in the land decided that the money was indeed ill-gotten . " The editorialist was correct . In ' Waco , most people still seem to think that if anyone con THE NEW YORKER netted with the Mystery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As it turned out , Chuck Barrera 's strategy of establishing the boys in the public mind as Huck Finn and Tom Sawyer worked even without the movie  --  failing to impress only the jurors who heard the evidence in court . MARK WHITE is now the governor of Texas . David Bragg and Roy Smithers are partners in a private law firm in Austin ; on the wall of Bragg 's office is a framed newspaper clipping with the headline " HUCK FINN TALE ENDS FOR TEENS . " George Shaffer still practices law in Corpus Christi , and Chuck Barrera still prac  --  tices law in Alice . When Barrera was asked not long ago what he got out of the case , he said , " The ice chest . " Somehow , it ended up on his porch . Thinking back on the case , Barrera says that it turned on the arrest of Hiroms ( " It was dirty money then , and they could n't let the boys have it ; they just had to figure out a legal reason " ) and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stolen the money  --  a statement Barrera had not known about until shortly before the trial . " It turned out to be real good tax planning , " one of Barrera 's law partners said recently . " They did n't have to pay a nickel in taxes . " Nobody in Alice writes angry letters to the newspaper complaining that the boys should have been allowed to keep the money . People in Alice are more inclined to say something like " These boys were not the sweet little boys next door . " The surprising fact that Mc  --  Lennan County ended up with the money did cause a few people to won  --  der why Jim Wells County did n't make a claim . The South Texas ap  --  proach to judging motives being what it is , that sort of speculation turns inevitably to trying to figure out who had the most to gain if the county stayed out of the case . Actually , law  --  yers familiar with the legal struggle over the Mystery Money do n't think that a serious argument could have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who is told this may shift to speculating about who owns those banks in Waco that were al  --  lowed to hold all that money for all those years . There is still a chance for Hub City Hollywood . Just after the Supreme Court decision , Barrera got another call from the Coast . The MGM/UAntertainment Company expressed in  --  terest in the movie rights to the boys ' stories . Since Santillan 's option had expired , the rights were available . If the movie is shot , the boys stand to make about twenty-five thousand dol  --  lars each . As of now , counting the Santillan option money and the MGM/UA option money , each has made only a few thousand dollars more than Dean gave his friend John Rose that evening for a ride to the bus station . Rose was not required to hand over four thousand dollars to McLen  --  nan County , but the county was awarded just about everything else . " I did n't know they 'd leave me with nothing , " Dean said recently . " Not even the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been driven from government storage in San Antonio to Waco , where the county will sell it at auction . The boys are supposed to get their Sears bluejeans back , but Percy , who has put on some weight since he was a sixteen-year-old baseball player , says that they would n't fit anyway . Dean and Percy are , of course , no longer boys . Both of them do a man 's work on the oil rigs . Both of them are fathers . Both of them live in the sort of tiny rental bungalows that have Masonite panelling on the walls , and toys on the floor , and a television set turned on as long as anybody is awake . Dean has a mustache now ; Percy has a beard . Right up to the end , they were confident that they would get at least part of the money . Even now , when people in the oil field ask them if they 're going to get it they are not quite willing to say , " No , never . " They talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lawyers . Still , they have begun to talk about the money in the past tense . Percy says he regrets not having noticed a flashy Hilton nearby before he and Dean checked into the slightly frayed Baker . " I ai n't never going to have that kind of money again , " Dean said recently . " I 'd he doing good just to buy me a house . It ai n't going to be early retire  --  ment for me . " Dean says that when he drove that blue Thunderbird onto the interstate he figured he would just travel all his life . " I did n't think I could spend it all , " he says . " I did n't get to spend hardly any of it . " ? CALVIN TRILL IN ? BROTHERHOOD OF MAN DEPT .
