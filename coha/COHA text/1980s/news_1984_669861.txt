In the shadow of the learned professions and the gentrified trades is a vital but slightly undignified body of knowledge . Without it , even skilled practitioners could hardly function . Yet much of it is too imprecise , too little understood , or simply too simple to share with the public . It is Tom Parker ' s service in " Rules of Thumb " ( Houghton Mifflin , 136 pages , $5. 95 ) to have gathered nearly 900 choice examples of educated guesswork from an astonishing variety of informants . He defines a rule of thumb as a mental tool that lets the user size up a situation roughly and quickly . " Murphy says that things will take longer than we think , " Mr. Parker explains . " A rule of thumb says how much longer . . . . While a proverb says that a stitch in time saves nine , a rule of thumb says to allow one inch of yarn for every stitch on a knitting needle . A maxim cautions us not to risk more than we can afford @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to lose more than twenty times the betting limit in a single poker game . " The growth and the real accomplishments of the computer industry seem to have convinced many lay people that there is now , or soon will be , a canned solution to each of life ' s problems , carried out to four decimal places . People in the field , whether medics or gardeners , know otherwise . From their shared experience , and not from any set of first principles or sophisticated mathematics , comes guidelines that will let them deal quickly and efficiently with new situations . What works is not always what is best understood . True to the spirit of his subject , Mr. Parker largely avoided conventional research and academic authorities in writing this book . He contacted as many individuals and publications as he could , soliciting entries . He edited and numbered them , added a helpful index and wrote a three-page introduction appealing for more rules . Yet in spite of or because of his procedures , " Rules of Thumb " is a brilliantly successful sampler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are stars and superstars of business and journalism . David Ogilvy , the advertising man , points out that copy should have sentences of less than 12 words . Jane Brody , the New York Times ' s health and nutrition specialist , says we should " eat breakfast like a king , lunch like a prince , and supper like a pauper . " In fact , a good rule of thumb seems to be that the more obscure the contributor , the better the rule of thumb . ( In fairness , many of the celebrity entries seem drawn from published works . ) A man from Calgary , Canada , listing his profession as " reprobate , " observes that the more graffiti there are on the back of a road sign , the worse the location will be for hitching a ride . The alderman of an unnamed city suggests , in choosing a wood stove , to allow 2. 5 cubic feet of firebox for each 1 , 000 square feet of living space . A Denver woman observes that people giving a party in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to attend , while for those in the city the ratio should be 1. 25 to 1 . If you ' ve always wished you had quit in poker while you were ahead , a rule here will tell you how much ahead  --  and how much is safe to put back in the game if the cards are running with you . There ' s a rule for bluffing , too . Lost ? You can survive three seconds without blood , three minutes without air , three days without water and three weeks without food . Assaulted ? Scream Fire ! For unexplained but evident reasons , it seems to work better than Help ! Many entries deal with such down-to-earth concerns as buying horses , feeding sheep and cattle , planting corn ( " when the oak leaves are the size of squirrel ' s ears " ) , using a paint roller and throwing a pot . But there also are tips from stunt pilots and scuba divers , and odd observations such as the North Vietnamese use of an outstretched arm to gauge the position of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down by groundfire . Doubtful as it is that either insurgents or dairy farmers will actually learn new ideas from this book for their respective metiers , it still deserves an audience of millions , for in its own way it is the first recent book I know of to record humanity ' s responses to the roughness , knottiness and general intractability of reality . Where else can we find one confirmation after another that 20% of inputs ( effort , customers , products , donors ) yields 80% of outputs ( results , sales receipts , contributions ) ? Where else can we find the testimony of our fellows that so many things take twice to three times longer than our best estimates , and cost correspondingly more ? Brightened by crisp design and the author ' s ironic , cerebral and technically superb drawings , " Rules of Thumb " virtually creates a new genre : folkware . Long may it flourish.  --  - Mr. Tenner is science editor at the Princeton University Press.               @ @ @ @ @ @
