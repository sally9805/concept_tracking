Though today she is enthusiastically caught up by the challenges of her job , she admits that in 1980 , when she was administrative director of Reykjavk ' s city theater , she was reluctant to become her country ' s chief of state. // ' ' For some time it was very difficult for me at the theater , ' ' she says , ' ' because phone calls were coming from all over the country to urge me to run . I had the mind to tell them , ' She has left for China and is not coming back . ' You do not see yourself as other people do . I was quite surprised that other people saw something in me that could be representative of Iceland. ' ' // As she points out , she was elected not because she was head of a political party , as are Margaret Thatcher or Indira Gandhi , but because she was perceived to be the best person for the job . ' ' The President of Iceland is not a political person , ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involved in politics or even belonged to any political party. ' ' // Under the circumstances her election in this tiny northern democracy ( approximately the size of Kentucky ) , which has the world ' s oldest parliament , attracted worldwide attention. // Ironically , despite predictions by the opposition , the majority of Icelandic women did not vote for her . ' ' I got 33. 8 percent of the vote , which proves that the ladies of this country didn ' t vote for me , ' ' she says . ' ' On the contrary , I think they were rather reluctant , because otherwise I would have gotten 50 percent at least. // ' ' Many ladies do not have confidence in themselves because in the male society they ' re used to having men run the whole thing , ' ' she continues . ' ' They don ' t have confidence in themselves , so why should they have confidence in another woman ? ' ' // In the forthcoming 18-month cultural exposition in the US , ' ' Scandinavia Today , ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Scandinavian countries. // The changing attitudes of and toward women in Iceland began in 1975 with an event called the Women ' s Day , when women in Iceland went on strike. // ' ' In Reykjavk there were between 20 , 000 and 30 , 000 women in the main square , ' ' she says . ' ' In small villages and towns all over Iceland , women left their homes and said to their husbands , ' Okay , you take over . ' Even television was paralyzed . The gentlemen in television had to organize themselves to bring the children to work . They had to arrange them in rooms and supervise them . Meanwhile , we were having fun . We went down to the square to this tremendous meeting . In the evening , radio reporters called all around the country to ask the men how they managed without their wives , and they described things in the most hilarious ways. // ' ' Then , as often , nothing happened for a long time , ' ' she continues . ' ' There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ladies were thinking , ' Good heavens , why did we organize that for a whole year , and nothing has come of it ? But now it is coming gradually. ' ' // As a high school student , shortly after World War II , Vigdis Finnbogadottir was preparing to enter a university . ' ' I was meditating about what I should do , ' ' she recalls , ' ' whether I should stay at home , study medicine , and become a doctor , or whether I should go out into the world somewhere else to study. // ' ' Both of my parents had studied abroad , and due to the war there was a great deal of discussion about Europe . I remember as a child I hoped they wouldn ' t destroy it all before I could come and see it , and I think that was what finally influenced me to go abroad . I was very enthusiastic about art and literature , so I chose France . I began my studies at Grenoble , where I studied mostly French . Later , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , theater literature , and then later in Copenhagen , theater history . So from the beginning my interests were always oriented toward the theater. // ' ' The funny thing is that with all my theater work , I always said , ' I don ' t want to be on stage . Behind the scenes , that ' s my job . ' . . . ' ' She pauses to reflect and chuckle . ' ' . . . And now I ' m standing on stage all the time. ' ' // Of her private life , President Vigdis says , ' ' It ' s a privilege to be an Icelander , because I can take my car whenever I wish , drive downtown , and visit my friends . Things haven ' t changed that much . Now , I have a little girl , nine years old , and I have protected her as much as possible from the limelight . So she doesn ' t quite realize my position . Sometimes she says , ' I don ' t like to be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her I have to meet an ambassador at 2 o ' clock , she says , ' Well , tell him to come tomorrow . ' Then I have to explain that I ' m in such a position that I can ' t ask the gentleman to come tomorrow. ' ' // As citizens of a small country , Icelanders have the advantage of ready access to their President . Twice a week on Monday mornings and afternoons citizens can come , by appointment , to discuss their problems with her . Some come to introduce their clubs or associations , and others to talk about something more personal , such as a legal problem . ' ' Now , I can ' t do anything about it because I ' m nonpolitical , ' ' she says . ' ' I sign the papers , but I can ' t tell judges what to do . If I did I ' d be a dictator . Psychologically , it is good for someone to talk to the President , and know afterward that the President knows about their problem. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact that Iceland has 100 percent employment , which she calls a luxury , adding , ' ' But that is the vicious circle . When you invest in building new houses , and you have constant work , you have to get the money from somewhere , and that creates inflation . We have had a terrible inflation here , but I think we are among the few nations of the world where inflation is decreasing , not going up. ' ' // About Iceland itself , the President is a confirmed optimist . ' ' We may only be 230 , 000 people in this country , ' ' she says , ' ' but we run this society as if we were 2 million . We have television , radio , a national theater , a municipal theater , a symphony orchestra , and an opera. . . . we have everything . We have been investing , we have been energetic , and we are very independent . That ' s why I ' m optimistic . If you ' re pessimistic it only slows you down. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
