THE TALK . OF THE TOWN Notes and Comment NOT long ago , we took note of the distressing news that great numbers of books are being printed on a kind of paper that is likely to disintegrate within as little as thirty years . Our confidence in the imperishability of literature has now been further shaken by the discovery that in at least one large bookstore in the city small shopping baskets of a kind commonly found in supermarkets are made available to the customers . Since that particular bookstore  --  consisting of two vast , fluorescent-lit display rooms with a checkout counter obstructing your way to the street  --  happens to resemble a supermarket anyway , the inescapable , though perhaps unintended , message is that hooks are consumable items , meant to be devoured and forgotten , like potatoes or frozen pizza . The implied inclusion of hooks among the world 's perishable goods is hardly made more agreeable by the reflection that increasing numbers of books these days do seem to he written with just such consumption in mind , and that most bookstores @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this sort , which are merchandised for a few weeks  --  sometimes only as long as they remain on the bestseller lists  --  and are then retired to discount stores ( those jumbled graveyards of hooks , so saddening to the hearts of authors ) shortly before dropping out of print altogether . Books that are planned for rapid oblivion , often in preparation for new and far more hicrative incarnations as movies , probably make some kind of economic sense to accountants somewhere in the " communications " conglomerates that own so many publishing houses , but as contributions to literature they amount to a contradiction in terms . It used to he part of the very idea of a hook that it would have a chance to speak beyond the lifetime of its author and its first generation of readers . You might even say that hooks were meant to consume us , while living forever themselves . A friend of ours who loves books reports that for him possession of a number of books of the new , calculatedly transient sort  --  acquired , in his case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a vexing burden . His first impulse on receiving , say , the autobiography of some celebrity or fashionable criminal , or a cocksure instruction manual on how to overhaul his personality , psyche , spirit , or investment portfolio , is to send it immediately to the fate that was apparently intended for it eventually anyway by the book industry , and throw it into the nearest wastebasket ; but an inconvenient scruple stays his hand . A book  --  any book  --  in a wastebasket , he finds , is a sight as incongruous and unacceptable to him as a banana peel on a bookshelf . Somehow , the reverence he feels for books in general always overcomes the repugnance he feels for the contents of the hook in question , with the odd result that while the people who presumably read and enjoy such books toss them cheerfully into the day 's garbage , our friend , who abhors them , must keep them until they turn into little heaps of dust on his shelves . ? ? Revisited yd aWARD ALBEE 'S newest play , " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago and closed after twelve performances , reminded us that it was time to have another talk with the author , who had remarked the last time we saw him , in 1974 , that he believed it was the responsibility of a serious playwright " to instruct . " " The Lady from Dubuque " ? and what it had to say instructively about illness , dying , and death ( of an individual and/or of our present society ) and the attempts of the dying to find a way to die while surrounded by those who resist their death  --  was received by most of the critics with what seemed to us to be considerable weariness . We therefore felt reassured last week , when we met Mr. Albee for lunch at the Algonquin , to see him looking energetic and practically ebullient , and also exceedingly trim , in a Harris-tweed jacket over a navy-blue wool sweater over a Marimekko shirt of dark-blue and light-blue pin checks , with gray corduroy trousers and dark-brown ankle-high shoes . He still had the same kind of full , free black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , how 's the instruction business ? " we asked as soon as he had given the waiter his order  --  fresh fruit and cottage cheese . " Very good , " Albee said , firmly and cheerfully . " Excellent . I just got back from a lecture tour . Four days at universities in Tucson and in Portland , Oregon , and then two days in Seattle , one of them resting and one at the Northwest Theatre Conference . The week before , I flew out to Kalamazoo to talk to students . I do between twenty and thirty appearances a year , all around the country . Over the years , I 've become less awkward and less shy . I used to be taciturn . Now you ca n't get me to shut up . " " What , exactly , do you do out there ? " we asked . " And why ? " " I do a lecture or a reading from my plays , with a question-and-answer period , " he said . " I also do two workshops , one with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creative writing . I talk a lot about the relationship between what drama tries to do and what people want you to do . I fly in and rent a car , because I love to drive around and get to know the country . And I love to walk around a town or a campus until it 's time for me to go where I 'm supposed to go . This last time out , I read from ' The Zoo Story , ' A Delicate Balance , ' and Counting the Ways , ' and read one entire short play , ' Box . ' Most of my characters are fond of the sound of their own voices . " He grinned , and dug into his fruit and cottage cheese . " The workshops are limited to fifty students , " he said . " Someone or something worthwhile invariably turns up in those . At the start , I have to get over the three impossible questions , of course : ' How do you write ? ' and ' Why do you write ? ' and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And your answers ? " we asked . " To the first , I say ' It 's something you know if you 're a writer , ' " Albee replied politely . " To the second , ' You write because you 're a writer . ' To the third , I usually say ' Schenectady . ' I 've been going out to the universities for fifteen years . I find it fascinating to see the changes in the students from the activist days to these , the ostrich days . They all want to get a good job and vanish . They do n't believe that political participation males any sense . They feel they ca n't do anything to make democracy work . I like talking to them because  --  in theory , at least  --  people of that age have not completely made up their minds , so maybe I can get at them . I do n't like living in a vacuum . I believe there 's a strong relationship between people 's being aesthetically informed and their being able to govern themselves . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Yes  --  I always learn something , " Albee said . " Somebody asks me a question , and I hear myself giving an answer , and I suddenly find out something I 'd never realized before . For example , one student said to me , ' Your characters never have last names . Why ? ' I said , ' I 'd have given them last names if I knew what they were . ' It was something I had n't realized before . Also , I love travelling . And the MARCH 311980 lectures pay nicely , given the vicissitudes of the theatre . I 'm told W. H. Auden used to go out and do thirty readings in thirty days . That could be a rat race . I never do that . " " What do you do in your workshops ? " we asked . " Discussions . Scenes . How at the age of twenty they figure out how to get into the mind of a fifty-five-year-old person . How to learn to differentiate between characters . Things like that . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're a writer . I read their plays . You end up reading a hundred plays , and if you 're lucky you 'll find someone to encourage . " " What generosity ? " we said . " It 's responsibility , " Albee said . " You 've got to encour-age talent . It 's an ohligati4n . This last tour was wonderful . But I did n't know when I left that it would coincide with the closing of the play . The critics . " He gave a small smile . " The critical re-sponse to the creative act . " He shook his head . " People think the critics are giving facts , not opinions , " he said . " We had ten favorable reviews and ten unfavorable reviews , but the economics of the theatre are such that you ca n't keep plays open with mixed reviews . And it 's becoming harder and harder for a serious play to get produced . in 1962 , it took seventy-five thousand dol-lars to produce ' Who 's Afraid of Vir-ginia Woolf ? ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three hun-dred thousand dollars to produce . I know my plays . I know my chances . Every single play of mine has had mixed reviews . Right down the middle . Walter Kerr said about ' Virginia Woolf ' that it had a ' hole in its head . ' The News said it was ' dirty . ' Back in the old days , what the critics said would hurt . Now I know that you ca n't permit yourself to let it destroy you . Or even hurt you . After having eighteen plays produced , I 've learned a few things . One , never expect anything but disaster . Two , there 's not neces-sarily any relation between what you 've done and what the critics say . Three , the ultimate judgment of your work probably wo n't be made for seventy-five years , and unless you 're exception-ally lucky you 're not going to find out how it comes out . The producers of The Lady from Dubuque ' ? there were seven of them , including Richard Barr , a decent and honorable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but one of my plays in New York  --  refused to make a fight for the play . It would probably have cost forty thousand dollars to mount an advertising campaign , and they refused to do it . I was disgusted that they did n't fight , but that was their business decision . They were shortsighted , though . If they had kept the play going for one more week , they would have been eligible to have a forty-per-cent share in the subsidiary rights  --  and I 've already agreed to productions of it in Zurich , Vienna , and Stockholm . The German critics were at the opening and wrote wonderful reviews , and Stefani Hun-zinger , the German agent who initially arranged for the production in West Berlin of my first play , ' The Zoo Story , ' in 1959 , is arranging to have The Lady from Dubuque ' produced in West Germany . I 've taken beatings from the critics before . My play ' Malcolm ' closed after seven performances . " Albee laughed , and polished off the last of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said . " But I 'd be happiest if the drama critics were poets or novelists . People who know something about the arts are the best critics . We need critics , because there 's always the danger that you 're missing something . Unfortunately , now what they do is tell me what I should expect commercially . But those thirty-second wonders on television are the real critical disgrace . So many in the commercial audience come to see plays because of what television says to them . If I have any nightmare , it is that I wake up and discover that the critics have been right . I could n't do a cheerful , carefree little play about death even if I wanted to . There 's nothing more embarrassing than to watch a serious writer try to do a potboiler  --  unless it 's watching the funny , situation-comedy writer try to get serious . " " Why not go back to Off Broadway ? " we asked . " I disapprove of the idea that a serious play has to be economically punished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easier to do plays in a favorable , protected environment , but people around the country think the nature of the theatre is determined by what is done on Broadway . It 's safer to do a play in a **25;6311;TOOLONG theatre . The economic pressures are less crushing . But it 's unhealthy to give in to them . I keep fighting against it . " " What 's next ? " we asked . " Lolita ' ? an adaptation of Nabokov 's novel which I wrote in part because I was so deeply offended by the movie version  --  will be produced soon , with Donald Sutherland . Also , I 'm on the Artistic Directorate of the Vivian Beaumont Theatre , at Lincoln Center , and I 've started collecting plays for a production this fall of one-act plays from the United States , Canada , and Latin America , in the Mitzi Newhouse Theatre , a lovely little theatre . About three hundred seats . Safe . " Al-bee grinned . " In a few days , I 'm going off for the State Department on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To Venezuela and Colombia this time . I 've been involving myself with Latin-American writers and their problems  --  their repressive governments , the establishment theatre 's lack of enthusiasm for anything new , the way the avant-garde theatre is automatically labelled leftist , the lack of communication between the countries . I 'll he discussing their woes , making new friends , and then , on my own time , going to see those wonderful waterfalls and Indian settlements . " " Staying put for a while after that ? " we asked . " I like to be a moving target , " Al-bee said , with a far from weary grin . Life Downstate SS TANLEY FINK , the Speaker of the Assembly of the State of New York , wants it understood that he is not one of those New York City provincials who regard everything north of Ninety-sixth Street as being vaguely " upstate . " Mr. Fink , who lives in Brooklyn , has gone out of his way to make friends beyond the city limits  --  north of White Plains , north of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Last year , he slept in a few unfamiliar beds while travelling around the state visiting farming communities . He did this travelling partly to learn how agricultural landowners feel about some state-government proposals to change proper ty-ta x-assessm e nt procedures . Also , he did it because he needed a lit- tie vacation . To return the hospitality , he decided to invite about twenty farmers  --  most of them dairy farmers , most of them officers of county farm hureaus  --  to explore the counties in the extreme downstate area , where a great deal of the tax money originates and to which it eventually returns . The junketers came to town for two days recently . Because their time was limited , the itinerary omitted Staten Island , the top of the Empire State Building , and Mamma Leone 's . However , it did include visits to the Transit Authority operations center , in downtown Brooklyn ; the Men 's Shelter , on the Bowery ; Gracie Mansion ; the New York State Theatre , where the City Ballet was performing ; the Hunts Point Terminal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ P.S. 236 and P.S. 312 , in Speaker Fink 's district ; a neighborhood of abandoned tenements in another part of Brooklyn ; and an agricultural high school in Flushing . At six-thirty on the morning of the second day  --  well into the milking hour  --  we boarded the farmers ' tour bus at Fiftieth Street and Tenth Avenue , and rode across town , up First Avenue , over the Harlem River , and along Bruckner Boulevard to the Hunts Point market . Most of the market business had ceased before daybreak , but the loading docks still bore plenty of produce  --  lettuce from California , oranges from Arizona , chili peppers from Texas , a few bushel bags of New York cabbages . Tony Moschitta , the Assistant to the Commissioner of Ports and Terminals , and Jose E. Serrano , an assemblyman , greeted the farmers . The group then crowded into Mr. Moschitta 's office and heard him describe how fruits and vegetables are delivered by rail and truck to the market , where they are bought by middlemen known as receivers , who sell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hotels . " How do they set prices for the growers ? " one dairy farmer asked . " The receiver agrees upon a price with the grower before it 's shipped , " said Mr. Moschitta . " How does he know the fair price ? " " They 've been doing this  --  the receivers have  --  for thirty or forty years . Each year , sales of produce in the metropolitan region run between one and three billion dollars . The receivers guess right about ninety-nine per cent of the time . " " How do the receivers get paid ? " another dairy farmer asked . " In cash , " said Mr. Moschitta . " They do it all in cash ? " " That 's why I said between one and three billion , " said Mr. Moschitta , with a Bronx smile . A man named Monty Stamp , who cultivates fifty-two acres of vineyards in the Finger Lakes region and is the secretary-treasurer of the New York State Wine-Grape Growers Association , remarked that Hunts Point apMARCH 3 , l 9 8 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gathering in the office was breaking up , he approached Mr. Moschitta with an offer to correct the situation . The next stop was a building near the market complex  --  the home of Gourmet Poultry Specialties , Inc. , a company that subjects chicken breasts to a process that converts them into supermarket-packaged Chicken Classics with names like Boneless Chicken Cutlets Alla Milanese and Boneless Chicken Breasts Hawaiian Style . None of the farmers happened to be in the poultry business , but they still had questions for Joe Pisano , the Gourmet Poultry sales manager . " What breeds do you use ? " asked Harry Garry , a dairy farmer from East Berne , near Albany . " What do you mean by breeds ? " said Mr. Pisano . " Well , " Mr. Garry said after a moment 's hesitation , " there are different breeds of chickens . Rhode Island Reds , Plymouth Rocks , Leghorns ... " " I do n't know anything about breeds , " said Mr. Pisano . " These are just chicken breasts . " A quick tour of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later , the farmers reboarded the bus , which beaded for P.S. 236 , in Mill Basin , where Ralph T , Brancle , the superintendent of Community School District 22 , was waiting to explain that it is difficult to run a public-school district but that he is trying to do his best ; where some children were waiting to show the out-of-town visitors a display of " typical Brooklyn sculpture " ( macaroni glued to pretzels and painted silver ) ; where the P.S. 236 Parents Association and several faculty members were waiting with coffee , cookies , bagels , lox , cream cheese , and grape jelly ; and where Stanley Fink was waiting to smile upon the entire occasion . During the bus ride , we sat next to Hugh Riehlman , a dairy farmer and town councilman of Preble , in Cortland County , and Robert Feasley , a dairy farmer from Eden , in Erie County . " I 'll be interested to see what Stanley 's district in Brooklyn looks like , " said Mr. Feasley . " Stanley said yesterday that he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the city and take off the blindfolds and we 'd think we 'd never left the farm . " As we were reflecting on a few sections of the city where that illusion could n't he maintained , a passing car caught Mr. Riehiman 's attention . " Did you see that bumper sticker ? " he asked . " See what it said ? ' Only Love Beats THE NEW YORKER Milk : I did n't know I 'd gone far enough today to be back in dairy country . " He had n't . He was on the Grand Central Parkway . Big Coat TWO eyes were peering out from a large bundle of fake fur and gabardine when we glanced up from the Post on the uptown West Side I.R.T. the other evening . " I am trying to persuade you to move over , so I can share that space , " said a voice from inside the coat . We managed to shift sidewise a few inches , and the coat sat down . It was Janet . " I do n't usually talk to anyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The other day , I turned to a man next to me and said ' I always talk to people on trains . Do you mind ? ' and he said ' Yes . ' Most people are not so sensitive . Yesterday , I looked up and sitting opposite me were two guys wearing gray jackets , no ties , and with the exact same face  --  two Faces exactly the same . I was wondering whether to mention it to them when one of them got up , and I said , ' Quick , look at that other man . You two look exactly alike . ' There was n't any instant recognition He just looked scared . Anyway , he was getting off the train and he did n't have time to do anything about it . My God , I thought , they 'll never know ! If they were long-lost relatives , I mean " What do you think of this coat ? " she asked , struggling to keep her head above the collar . " Nobody believes I bought it . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lady . It happens to have been reduced from three-fifty to ninety-five dollars . Several people can wear it at once . " We nodded . " You 're very shy , are n't you ? " Janet said . " Shy people are the only people who scare me before I scare them . They have this aura of aloofness . If it turns out that they do n't want to be shy , I tell them that 1 have overcome my shyness to a remarkable degree . Just after Christmas , we started some community singing  --  my group that I had picked up on the platform before we got on the train and a few people who came running down the stairs yelling ' HoId the door ! ' We were all crushed together , and I suggested that we sing  --  anything other than ' Down by the Old Mill Stream . ' So we tried ' Old King Wenceslas ' ? is that what it 's called ? ? but we did n't get very far . We were stared down coldly at ' yonder peasant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the coat and emerged with a slip of paper . " I do n't believe this , " she said . " I wrote it down on the way to work the other morning . It says ' I have thoughts . ' There 's a period after it . There are times when my whole life is going before my eyes and I ca n't think of anything . I notice that some people read on the subway , and it 's very difficult to attract their attention . I do n't read anything anymore except envelopes . Al the letters I get lately have a question on the envelope . ' Should you be punished for being born with a high I.Q. ? " What looks like a yellow-green powder , is packed in small pellets , and can destroy the city where you live ? ' Actually , that question was inside an envelope I made the mistake of opening . ' Who killed Karen Silkwood ? ' I have four of those . Where do YOU fit in the class structure of the United States ? FREE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' I 've asked myself that question all my life . What is the free gift , I wonder . I 'm on lists . Luckily , Reagan and Connally have n't been able to reach me yet . " The Jehovah 's Witnesses came to see me again the other day . They always give you a little hook ? ' In God We Trust , ' or something . This one was green , and it was called ' Is the Bible Really the Word of God ? ' Another question . That 's what I was saying to them . They think God wrote it and I think people wrote it . I said to them , ' I want to be resurrected , ' and they said , ' Do you mean reincarnation ? ' They were very upset , because only Jesus does the other thing . They kept telling me the Truth , and I kept saying there was more than one truth . I did n't want to upset them . Nobody budged an inch . " The only reason I 'm interested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I asked myself recently whether I had any fears , and I realized that I did have one  --  fear of death . Then I thought of another one  --  fear of life . So now I say to people that I am only afraid of two things  --  death and life . Being religious means being more prepared to meet someone . Your Maker , I think . Right now , I 'd rather meet someone here . Someone I was going with is about to get married to someone else , I figured out that the best way for someone to get married is to go with me . ' Go ' in the Biblical sense . " I went to a wonderful wedding last Saturday . At least , it was supposed to be a wedding . We all marched out to this place in Riverdale , and when we got there the minister said he could n't marry them , could n't perform the ceremony . It was n't long enough after the blood test .
