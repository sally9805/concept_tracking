Time was when sales of Christmas albums were an on-again , off-again proposition . Perennial favorites like Bing Crosby , Barbra Streisand , and Nat King Cole usually sold well , but , according to Geoff Mayfield , associate director of retail research at Billboard , a trade magazine , ' ' Christmas music would do well every other year or every three years. ' ' // Recently however , that pattern has changed . Christmas music has become big business , selling more albums than ever before . Incredible though it seems , Mr. Mayfield credits two albums for launching the current trend : pianist George Winston ' s ' ' December , ' ' which came out in 1982 , and Mannheim Steamroller ' s ' ' Mannheim Steamroller Christmas , ' ' released in 1984. // // ' ' With George Winston doing some thoughtful solo piano interpretations and Mannheim Steamroller offering a refreshing mixture that combines traditional music elements with some contemporary stylings , those two albums opened a new perspective on what Christmas music could sound like , ' ' said Mayfield in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ George Winston album sells like a new release. ' ' // ' ' Mannheim Steamroller Christmas ' ' is approaching double platinum , having sold almost 2 million copies - all with little publicity . The latest Mannheim Steamroller Christmas album , ' ' A Fresh-Aire Christmas ' ' ( 1988 ) sold 780 , 000 copies to record stores before any were actually shipped , and sales figures are now up to almost 1. 5 million . The albums held the top two spots last December on Billboard ' s Christmas hits chart , and this year they have crept onto the magazine ' s pop chart - an almost unheard-of event for Christmas music. // Mayfield could only explain why the response has been so enthusiastic by saying , ' ' People enjoy celebrating the holidays , and this ( music ) makes it a hipper way of doing that. ' ' // Reached by phone , composer Chip Davis , the force behind the two Mannheim Steamroller albums and founder of the Omaha-based American Gramaphone record label , said the success of the album surprised even him : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down on in the record business . When I did that first album , I did it against a lot of the distributors ' wishes . . . . They were , like - ' You sure you want to do a Christmas album ? ' But I was doing it really for myself. // ' ' A lot of people have asked me why mine sells more than the others , ' ' Mr. Davis continues , ' ' and I don ' t really know the answer to that . But one thing I know I ' ve done differently than a lot of artists is that I ' ve made the music the star , instead of ( a particular artist ) . Sometimes there ' s a magic in something that you can ' t really pinpoint . I always used to say , back when we were dealing with vinyl , there ' s something in the grooves that goes beyond the physical notes : There ' s a feeling that ' s in there. ' ' // The interest in ' ' new age ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of contemporary Christmas albums . New-age music , with its broad mix of styles and easy-listening flavor , lends itself well to old carols and even up-to-date holiday pop songs - everything from ' ' Joy to the World ' ' to ' ' Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer. ' ' // Chip Davis had a corner on the new-age audience before the term was coined . His eclectic instrumental ' ' Fresh Aire ' ' recordings - mixing classical , pop , and rock styles with a healthy dose of synthesizers , had grounded him solidly in the adult alternative market , and the popularity of his Christmas albums are a natural outcome of that earlier success. // Because of the successes of the Manheim Steamroller and George Winston albums , everybody seems to have jumped on the bandwagon , with about 40 new holiday releases last season and about 30 this season . They include everone from pop artists like New Kids on the Block ( ' ' Merry , Merry Christmas ' ' ) to country artists such as Randy Travis ( ' ' An Old Time Christmas ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ' Twisted Christmas ' ' ) . // From the new albums , I ' ve come up with my own selection of the noteworthy : // The Cambridge Singers : ' ' Christmas With the Cambridge Singers , ' ' ( Collegium COLCD 111 ) offers 21 tracks of lovely traditional and modern choral music , accompanied by the City of London Sinfonia and conducted by English choir director and composer John Rutter . It comes with a booklet of lyrics , including ' ' Oh Holy Night , ' ' ' ' Sussex Carol , ' ' ' ' Coventry Carol , ' ' ' ' For unto us a child is born ' ' from Handel ' s ' ' Messiah , ' ' and one of the sweetest pieces of music you ' ll ever hear : John Rutter ' s own ' ' What Sweeter Music.

B 137 , Glastonbury Blvd . , Glastonbury , CT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beautiful , if not best-known , carols , including the charming ' ' Ding ! Dong ! Merrily on High ' ' ( from 16th-century France ) , ' ' In Dulce Jubilo ' ' ( German ) , and ' ' Shepherd ' s Pipe Carol ' ' by John Rutter ( plus five others by him ) . The orchestral backgrounds are grand , and the singing is glorious . This is a perfect companion disc to the Cambridge Singers collection , a great album to play while trimming the tree. // Teja Bell : ' ' The New Spirit of Christmas ' ' ( Music West MWCD-160 ) . Those who prefer a contemporary sound that never loses track of the spirit of Christmas will enjoy Teja Bell ' s guitar and synthesizer renditions of classic carols like ' ' Silent Night , ' ' ' ' O Come , O Come , Emmanuel , ' ' and ' ' O Little Town of Bethlehem ' ' - plus two originals , ' ' New Spirit ' ' and ' ' Tree of Life . ' ' The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effective use of synthesized brass , organ , and shimmering chimes. // Various guitarists : ' ' Christmas Guitars ' ' ( Green Linnet CSIF 1103 ) . Larry Coryell , the Guitar Ensemble , Adrian Belew , Taj Mahal , Yomo Toro , Emily Remler , and others lend their talents to this benefit album for the National Coalition for the Homeless . It ' s an uneven collection , ranging from the quiet simplicity of John Scofield ' s ' ' Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas ' ' to the twangy , country-western version of ' ' White Christmas ' ' played by the guitar ensemble , to Michelle Shocked ' s embarrassingly incorrect version of ' ' The Christmas Song. ' ' // Tom Stacy and Rob Mathes : ' ' A Nu-View Christmas ' ' ( London 425215-2 ) . The warm and soaring sound of an English horn with high-tech , new-age arrangements makes for for an updated , slightly jazzy Christmas sound .
