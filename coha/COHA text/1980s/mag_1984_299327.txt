Last June , Publisher Rupert Murdoch ( New York Post , the Times of London ) startled executives of St. Regis by revealing that he had bought 5.6% of the shares of the big paper and forest-products company for $65 million . A few weeks later Murdoch launched a takeover fight . That sent the St. Regis officers scrambling to find a so-called White Knight who would save them from the publisher by buying their firm . Last week Champion International , a rival forest-products giant , came forward to do precisely that . Champion agreed to pay about $1.8 billion in cash and stock for the company . If approved by federal regulators , the deal will create the largest paper producer ( combined 1983 sales : $7.1 billion ) in the U.S. <P> Many Wall Street analysts welcomed the transaction . Said Mark Rogers of Dean Witter Reynolds : " This deal will make almost everybody happy . " That includes Murdoch , who stands to make a profit of around $37 million by selling his St. Regis stock to Champion .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
