The SALT II treaty has been in legislative limbo since the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan last December , but in the past week its fate has become one of the most heated and important disagreements between Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan . Carter wants to save the treaty , Reagan wants to kill it . As TIME Diplomatic Correspondent Strobe Talbott reports , the issue has grave implications : <P> There is a political and historical irony in the positions of the two candidates on SALT II . Reagan proposes to scrap the present treaty and reopen negotiations with the Kremlin . His goal : a new agreement that would substantially reduce the Soviet arsenal of intercontinental missiles and thus blunt the danger of a surprise attack against the American rockets . Reagan hopes to induce the Soviets to go back to the bargaining table by threatening a new arms race . <P> In its broad outlines , Reagan 's plan is almost identical to Carter 's at the beginning of his presidency in 1977 . Carter had inherited from Gerald Ford a SALT II agreement that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " real arms control " treaty of his own that would roll back , rather than merely slow down , the Soviet weapons program . <P> Carter then , like Reagan now , wanted to protect U.S. missiles against the theoretical possibility of a Soviet pre-emptive strike . Carter then , like Reagan now , told the Kremlin , in effect , either make more concessions or face new and bigger U.S. missiles . <P> The Soviet leadership threw Carter 's " comprehensive " proposal right back in his face ; his ill-considered initial approach to the Soviets was one of Carter 's major foreign policy mistakes . The SALT II treaty he ended up signing with Leonid Brezhnev in 1979 was based largely on the deal that Ford had struck with Brezhnev three years before , although the final agreement did contain some advantages for the U.S. <P> Carter rightly calls Reagan naive for thinking the Soviets can be intimidated into accepting deep cuts in their existing arsenal by the threat of a future U.S. buildup . But were it not for Carter 's own similar naivet four years ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his Administration , long before its passage was " linked " to Soviet behavior in Cuba and Afghanistan . Such linkage was always dubious , since SALT benefits both sides . <P> When Carter made his false step with SALT II early in 1977 , the SALT I interim agreement on offensive weapons still had seven months to run . Since then , the superpowers have been adhering to SALT I even after it expired , and to the main provisions of SALT II even though it remains unratified.
