CENTRAL AMERICA <P> As worries grow about El Salvador , a new U.S. initiative takes shape <P> There are no plans to send American combat troops into action any place in the world . " For what seemed to be the umpteenth time , Ronald Reagan gave that assurance last week about the limits of U.S. involvement in Central America . But even as he once again cleared the air , Reagan further obscured it . The President saw no point in telegraphing any of the other moves that Washington may have in mind to deal with a region that is stubbornly aboil with Marxist-inspired insurrection , and where the Administration feels that vital U.S. interests are at stake . As Reagan put it at his White House press conference : " I just do n't believe that you discuss those options or what you may or may not do in advance of doing any of those things . " <P> That statement also summarized Reagan 's biggest problem with the region : the climate of public uncertainty surrounding U.S. action in tiny , embattled El Salvador . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is being waged alongside the war between El Salvador 's civilian-military government , backed by the U.S. , and 4,000 to 6,000 Marxist-led guerrillas that Washington charges are being supplied with arms from nearby Nicaragua and from Cuba . <P> On the one side , the Reagan Administration has said with deliberate ambiguity that it will do " whatever is necessary " to prevent a guerrilla victory , which the U.S. fears would accelerate Soviet-sponsored subversion throughout Central America . On the other , Administration opponents charge that the U.S. is blundering deeper into an open-ended military commitment to a losing cause . So far , the Administration has done little to back up its most important contention , namely that the real U.S. aim in El Salvador is not a military victory but the political and economic framework needed for democracy to flourish in a strife-torn and bitterly impoverished region . <P> Skepticism over the Administration 's approach reached a new pitch last week after three delegations of U.S. Congressmen descended on El Salvador to take then-own soundings . One of the most vociferous of the skeptics was Vermont Senator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Rhode Island . After a private meeting with El Salvador 's Defense Minister , General Jos Guillermo Garcia , Leahy emerged with Pell and U.S. Ambassador to El Salvador Deane Hinton and complained that he " got along very badly " with the general , who had energetically demanded more U.S. military aid . For his part , Pell told Garcia that " Congress would not continue to authorize unlimited funds for El Salvador if there continued to be gross violations of human rights , gross assassinations and cruel murders . " <P> The same conclusion was reached by another visiting Congressional team , Representatives Tom Harkin of Iowa and James L. Oberstar of Minnesota , both Democrats , and Republican Jim Coyne of Pennsylvania . Criticizing the regime 's " inhumane " military tactics at a news conference , Oberstar said flatly that the Salvadoran government " should not have our military support . "
