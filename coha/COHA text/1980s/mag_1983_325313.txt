An uphill climb to 1985 <P> " All this talk of my going downhill , " insisted India 's Prime Minister Indira Gandhi last week , " is just so much political nonsense . " Translation : she is going downhill all right , but she is fighting back . Her Congress ( I ) Party ( the " I " is , of course , for Indira ) has not won a majority in any of the eight state elections it has fought since Mrs. Gandhi 's return to power in 1980 . It fared particularly badly last month in the southern states of Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka , which had supported the Congress Party since India became independent in 1947 . More elections were scheduled in the Union Territory of Delhi last weekend and in the troubled northeastern state of Assam next week . Whatever the outcome of these contests , Mrs. Gandhi will have to work hard to rebuild her party in time for the 1985 national elections , when she hopes to win an unprecedented fifth term as Prime Minister . <P> She was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grew tired of the repressive manner in which she governed India during the 1975-77 state of emergency that she had proclaimed . This time the issues are more diffuse . Opposition parties charge that the Congress leadership has become corrupt and insensitive to the public welfare . In addition , there are powerful local controversies . In Andhra Pradesh , for instance , the movie star turned politician N.T. Rama Rao won a stunning victory for his new Telugu Desam party , advocating increased powers for the state 's Telugu majority . In Delhi , many Sikhs vowed to boycott last weekend 's elections , thereby showing their support for the movement that is advocating greater autonomy for the rich agricultural state of Punjab , the Sikh homeland . <P> Nowhere is regionalism more explosive than in Assam , where voters are angry about the wave of nearly 4 million refugees who have entered that state illegally from Bangladesh in the past decade . What makes the Assamese especially bitter is that the refugees , who are grateful to have been given sanctuary in India and thus are overwhelmingly pro-Gandhi , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week 's elections . As a result , all the opposition parties in Assam , including the Marxists , are boycotting the elections , thereby assuring a Congress Party victory . To halt a surge of election-related violence , the New Delhi government has sent 40 battalions of paramilitary police to Assam . <P> Trying to strengthen her government , Mrs. Gandhi two weeks ago asked all 60 members of her Council of Ministers to submit resignations . She fired only seven ministers and named a dozen new ones , prompting criticism that she lacked the nerve to undertake a wholesale housecleaning . Luckily for Mrs. Gandhi , the opposition parties are at least as disorganized as her Congress Party ; no candidate has emerged as a serious rival for 1985 , and her personal popularity remains high .
