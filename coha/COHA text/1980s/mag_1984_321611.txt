Last week when Muslim guerrillas of the Shi'ite Amal militia led the attack on Lebanese Army units controlling West Beirut , it signaled the emergence of yet another faction from the wings onto center stage . With that stunning victory , the once obscure Amal , under Leader Nabih Berri , was suddenly poised to play a decisive role in Lebanon 's future . <P> The Amal 's newly won prominence is long overdue . In 1932 the last official census established the Christians as Lebanon 's largest group and justified an agreement guaranteeing them a dominant role in the government . By most estimates , however , the Shi'ites now outnumber all other factions , constituting roughly 40% of Lebanon 's population of 3.5 million to 4 million . Until recently the Shi'ites have remained a silent underclass . Made up of impoverished farmers from the south and also of Beirut 's urban poor , the Shi'ites long adhered to conservative Islamic teachings that called for political obedience to the ruling government , regardless of its injustices . <P> That began to change in the 1975 civil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Lebanese Shi'ite leader Imam Moussa Sadr formed the Amal ( meaning hope in Arabic ) , originally intending it to be a political organization exerting pressure to better the lot of Shi'ites living in poverty in Beirut 's southern suburbs . But in a country constantly at war , it quickly became clear that social and political change would be achieved only through military force . The Amal developed a military wing , fortifying the Shi'ite neighborhoods with sandbags and training youths in street fighting and in the use of Kalashnikovs . <P> Initially weak , the Amal at first kept a low profile . When P.L.O . forces in West Beirut came under attack from the Israelis in the summer of 1982 , however , the Amal supported the Palestinians . That loyalty was rewarded when the P.L.O . finally evacuated the city and the Amal obtained substantial quantities of P.L.O . arms . Thus strengthened , the Amal set up what was effectively a Shi'ite state within a state in the southern suburbs . <P> Despite its increasing military muscle , the Amal has steered a relatively moderate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Iran 's Ayatullah Khomeini . When Moussa Sadr mysteriously disappeared after a falling-out with Muammar Gaddafi during a visit to Libya in 1978 , he was soon succeeded by the forceful Berri , a lawyer by training , who quickly won a reputation for keeping his own counsel . Like other Muslim leaders , Berri has fiercely opposed the Christian Phalangists . But although the Amal gets much of its financial and military support from the Syrians , Berri has refused to align himself completely with Damascus , arguing that the Amal 's interests are best served by remaining independent .
