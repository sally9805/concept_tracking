Digital Equipment Corp. , whose profit margins have been under pressure , effectively raised prices on most of its products by 6% to 9% . The boost was sharply higher than the 3% to 5% increase that industry leader International Business Machines Corp. instituted on many products in July . Some analysts had previously forecast that Digital would match that increase . Digital ' s increase was accomplished by eliminating a highly touted , free one-year warranty program and by starting to charge for the equivalent service . Digital , based in Maynard , Mass. , appeared wary about publicizing the increase . It announced the action late yesterday afternoon , on the Columbus Day holiday . And it carefully avoided terming the action a price increase , characterizing it as a move to let customers " choose the most appropriate level of warranty support . " However , a spokesman conceded that the action amounts to a price increase . Digital said it will advise most customers to buy its " standard warranty " which adds about 6% to 9% to the equipment cost and provides about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service at the customer ' s location . Free service is available only for customers who bring their computers to Digital facilities for repair . John Buckley , Digital ' s manager of U.S. sales administration , said the company considered simply raising prices , but decided on the warranty changes because " it does give the customers some choices . If you have a price increase customers don ' t have any choice except to not buy . " The warranty changes are effective immediately in the U.S. and will be expanded internationally next year . Digital also said it will increase by 2% the price of add-on hardware and software products purchased separately from the computer system . The " standard warranty " on those products adds another 6% to 9% . The increase is likely to meet approval on Wall Street . Last month when Jeff Goverman , an analyst with Soundview Financial Group said he had learned of a planned 3% to 5% increase , Digital ' s stock rose . Yesterday , its shares closed at $88. 125 , down $1. 375 . Digital ' s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the summer of 1987 , has been depressed ever since last fall ' s market crash , and has moved steadily lower over the past year . Although its sales rose 22% to $11. 48 billion in the fiscal year ended June 30 , net income rose only about 15% to $1. 3 billion , and margins shrank in the fourth quarter . Digital boosted spending on sales and marketing by 38% and on research and development by 30% in fiscal 1988 in an effort to expand market share at the expense of IBM . Analysts expect revenue growth this year to slow 16% to 18% , and they are divided on whether Digital can hold down expenses enough to maintain profit margins . However , if most customers accept the premium prices on the warranties , both revenue and margins would be helped . Digital ' s Mr. Buckley , in an interview , said : " We would expect a fair amount of ( the price change ) to come to the bottom line . " He said that he expects that 60% to 70% of Digital ' s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with 10% to 15% taking a free coverage that requires them to bring their computers to Digital facilities if they break . Remaining customers are expected to buy other warranty programs that Digital is adding at different price levels . In the past , Digital , like most computer makers , seldom raised prices because declining parts costs and improved designs made it possible to continually deliver more performance at lower prices . Earlier this year , however , many computer makers raised prices to reflect higher costs of dynamic random access memory or DRAM chips . Digital cited memory costs for a 3. 5% price increase in June . Analysts previously have said that Digital customers who buy large computers would willingly swallow price increases , so the warranty-based pricing isn ' t likely to cut Digital ' s sales . The company ' s workstation business , however , has been less profitable , because of stiff price competition from Sun Microsystems Inc. and others . A Digital spokesman said that other workstation makers haven ' t offered as generous a warranty as Digital , leaving Digital at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considerably more than the underlying costs . Computers have become increasingly reliable in recent years , reducing the need for service . Digital cited its lower costs when it introduced its free warranty 18 months ago .
