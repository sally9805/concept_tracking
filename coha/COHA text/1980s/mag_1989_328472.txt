The life of a Jewish klansman is not chopped liver . Jordan Gollub , who was born of Jewish parents in Philadelphia , managed despite that fact to become Grand Dragon of the Virginia chapter of the Christian Knights of the Ku Klux Klan . In 1985 he was dismissed by Virgil Griffin , the self-proclaimed national leader of the anti-black , anti-Semitic hate group . Gollub contends that it was not his Jewish origins that led to his ouster , but an intra-Klan factional dispute . Undeterred , Gollub moved on to Mississippi and snaked his way back into becoming that state 's Klan leader . Last week Griffin fired him again , this time citing Gollub 's " Jewish background . " Still determined to preach his prejudices , Gollub , 30 , vowed to form his own Klan . He is not likely to find many followers whose hate , like his , extends even to themselves .
