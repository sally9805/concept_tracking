For the moment , musical culture is on hold in Fort Worth , unless , that is , you want to go over to the Cowboy Cantina , off Main Street , behind the courthouse , where the old and fragrant stockyards used to be. // At the Cowboy Cantina , men are men and women are blondes . The summer hats are white and two feet wide . It ' s rude to take them off indoors . They gallop up to the Cowboy Cantina in their pickup trucks , all these shining young cowboys and cowgirls . First , the tequila oozes and then the beer flows ; only Easterners need a glass . Don ' t ask where the nonsmoking section is. // If you ' re hungry , the barbecue next door comes on paper plates - no knives and forks but there ' s Lava soap in the bathroom for when you ' re through . You ' ve got to practice a little to get along at the Cowboy Cantina : lick the salt off the shot glass , drink the tequila @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Repeat as necessary . Let someone else drive. // At the Cowboy Cantina , the dance floor is busy . Above it slowly spins a Texas chandelier - a huge neon-lit plastic spur that twists slowly in the cigarette smoke . Beneath , the ballrooms of old Europe collide with the exuberance of the new West . Cowboys and cowgirls in each other ' s grip turn , whirl and roam in wide arcs. // At the Cowboy Cantina , the musicians in the band have heard of the word " pianissimo " and have been meaning to look it up , but for the moment loud to very loud will do . Aleksei Sultanov , the little Soviet howitzer of a pianist who won this year ' s Cliburn , couldn ' t compete with this kind of volume. // There ' s the sentiment of country-and-western music in all this noise , and I don ' t think anyone who deeply feels his American self can miss being touched by Patsy Cline or Hank Williams . There ' s comfort in this music , a friend said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how you shout them . At the Cowboy Cantina , you ' ll get the loudest lullabies you ever heard. // Mr. Cliburn ' s arty friends and the patrons of the Cowboy Cantina seem to get along just fine . I saw someone at the Kimbell Art Museum - all bow legs , tight jeans and Stetson hat - looking long and hard at a Tintoretto the other day . You could tell he liked it almost as much as he liked Patsy Cline. // That ' s what ' s nice about Texas - a certain freedom from artifice , the genuine curiosity about other people ' s art . There ' s very little of the arrogance that assumes culture to be automatically bestowed by birthright - labor-free and by osmosis . Maybe Texans end up being so smart because at the start they don ' t mind admitting what they don ' t know . They say the Kimbell is the best small art museum in the country . I think Fort Worth deserves it. // Old and new frontier run into each other with a bang down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the jolt of that fantastical skyline . Dallas architecture may scream sophisticated newness , but it ' s frontier newness - it ' s a city that sits bolt upright out of barren flatland , like one of those wooden , one-street towns in a Wild West movie . Think of Shane in his Accura Legend on the way down Route 30 toward a rendezvous with Wilson , the hired gun . Mechanized , the West is the same. // I hear there are a lot of fights around the Cowboy Cantina , though I didn ' t see any . In the newspapers , you read about shootings and robberies , and law and order as practiced around here can sometimes sound peremptory . Indeed , there must be a lot of darkness in these people that a visitor just does not see. // But the Texans I ' ve met also have an optimistic way of seeing problems through . They don ' t complain and they don ' t give up . This is why you couldn ' t export the Cliburn competition - which is extraordinarily well-operated - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go - armies of them. // Are the people who run the Cliburn and those down the street at the Cowboy Cantina really all that different ? The music isn ' t quite the same , but there is a Texas generosity and a Texas energy in both . If Texas has one unsolved problem in this respect , it ' s how to find people who deserve all the nice things Texans want to give. // The Eighth International Van Cliburn Piano Competition is one proof of that ; so , too , was the Dallas Civic Opera last fall when it put on Dominick Argento ' s " Aspern Papers . " Could the people in Dallas have possibly treated a premiere any better ? First-rate singing , playing , producing , staging , documenting and explaining , but for an opera that ended up being hardly worth the trouble. // You hate to think so , but the Cliburn just past may have been one more Texas exercise in frustrated generosity . In any case , with this year ' s winner the Cliburn has given birth to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ musical intelligence . How this 19-year-old is going to ride out from Fort Worth into two years of worldwide concert tours is a good question . It may be like rewarding a child with a successful lemonade stand by asking him to manage a Wall Street portfolio. // All the voting judges this year were from out of town , and half from other countries . Maybe Texans could do a better job . Watching cowboys soak up Tintoretto as they do Patsy Cline gives me a lot of hope in that direction . At any rate , the cowboys and cowgirls down at the Cowboy Cantina would have my vote to vote . What a jury room it would make , and think of all the ways to relieve the pressures in between ballots . If a judge is stubborn , whisk him away for a liberating Texas polka . Tequila might melt the coldest of Cold War hearts. // The ancient Persians , as I remember reading , had a similar way of making policy . They voted on important issues twice - once when they were sober and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reversed the order , but it doesn ' t seem like a bad idea either way. //
