Olympic pins , pennants , T-shirts , mugs and posters adorn windows of shops along Main Street . Flags from the 37 competing nations still flutter high above the speed-skating oval at the Lake Placid High School , where Eric Heiden won five gold medals. // Hotels and motels offer customers complimentary postcards from the games , and residents are at a loss when asked what the central business district - a 10-block strip of hotels , restaurants and boutiques - was called before it became known as the Olympic Village. // Many of the 2 , 700 residents of this mountain resort community cling to the memories of the games , while others are enjoying the good fortune that being host to the 13th Winter Olympiad has brought to the area. // " Business has never been better , " said Serge Lussi , owner of the Holiday Inn here , who was chairman of the Alpine skiing events during the games . " We ' re booked solid through May . Tourism was up last summer . And we ' ve seen an increase in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mountain has brought a lot of people into the area , but the Olympics really put us on the map. " // Local residents , a friendly mix of working-class and professionals of third- and fourth-generation families , are eager to talk to anyone willing to talk about the Olympics . They recall the night thousands poured onto Main Street to celebrate the United States hockey team ' s victory over the Soviet Union . They remember having brushed elbows with a Vice President , a king , a queen , a lord and several governors. // But the memories are not all fond ones : They also recall thousands of spectators stranded in the cold for hours awaiting bus transportation to and from the events as members of the Lake Placid Olympic Organizing Committee struggled to correct the problem . Traffic in the one-stoplight village was snarled as residents and visitors tried to learn the new routes implemented during the games. // Some residents complained of being displaced from their homes or apartments to make room for visitors , who paid almost double the going rate in rent. // Residents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accounts of profiteering during the games . " The transportation problem was cleared up in two days , " said Steve Wilson , who was born in Lake Placid 24 years ago and now attends Albany State College , " but the way it came out in the papers , you would have thought it lasted for the entire duration of the games. " // Nevertheless , nearly everyone here now concedes that the games were " good for the community . " Many talk about the " emotional letdown " that fell over the village when they ended. // " I went home and cried like a baby , " said Sheila Jennings , who worked for ABC-TV during the games and now works as a waitress at Lum ' s restaurant on Main Street . " Imagine having thousands of people from all over the world living in your community . Then all of a sudden , they leave . It takes a while to get used to. " // The Olympics breathed new life into many of the depressed communities of Essex County , where unemployment was once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ created as a result of the Olympics , have been retained , but the unemployment rate - which dropped to 4 percent before the games - has once again showed signs of increasing. // Jack Shea , the supervisor of the Town of North Elba , which includes the village of Lake Placid , noted that when he became supervisor in 1974 , the tax rate was $67 per $1 , 000 in assessed valuation ; it has since decreased to $53. 99 . During the same period the tax base increase from $9 million to $12. 2 million and sales revenues increased by $2 million. // " In 1974 , the town ' s surplus was $600 , " Mr. Shea said in his office in Town Hall , directly opposite the Olympic Arena . " Now we have a surplus of $170 , 000 . Those figures may have something to do with the Olympics , but not everything . It has a lot to do with management of town government. " // Some residents fear that unless the Federal or state government appropriates additional funds to help the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make up its $8. 5 million deficit in increased property or sales taxes . Many of the Olympic facilities , including the speed-skating oval , are on property owned by the village or the town of North Elba. // Since the games ended , the facilities - the 90-meter and 70-meter ski jump complex at Intervale , the new fieldhouse arena in Lake Placid Village , the adjacent speed-skating oval , the bobsled run , the luge run and biathlon trails at Mount Van Hoevenberg and ski trails at Whiteface Mountains - have become tourist attractions. // More than 60 , 000 visitors have paid $1 each for a guided tour of the Olympic facilities . Lift-ticket revenues have increased from $860 , 000 in 1979-80 to an estimated $1. 5 million for the current season , and anticipated revenues from Mount Van Hoevenberg are expected to be some $300 , 000 . More than 3 , 000 persons have been carried down the bobsled run this season at a nominal fee. // Beginning next Sunday , and running through the following Saturday , Lake Placid will play host to the Junior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scheduled for March 13 . The Junior Luge World Championship will be held here in 1982 and the Luge World Cup and the Bobsled World Championship have been scheduled for 1983. // On Main Street , a group of 10 window-shoppers stood silently in the rain , their eyes glancing over an array of Olympic-inspired souvenirs and then settling on a television screen in the Kehoes ' boutique where a videotape of the hockey series was playing. // " Sometimes they ' ll cheer or sing the national anthem at the end of the tape , " said Anne-Marie Kehoe , the owner of the boutique , who has been captivating pedestrians with the videotape . " I ' ve seen some people cry. " // Mrs. Kehoe , a native of Sweden who moved here from Los Angeles a few years ago with her husband , Tyrone , shows a visitor an autographed picture of Jim Craig , the United States goalie , hanging behind the counter . " He was in here and signed that for me , " she said with pride . " Heiden was in here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Queen of Sweden , but it is the picture of Craig , on a wall with autographed photos of other celebrities , that Mrs. Kehoe will point to first. // " My husband took several pictures of the King and Queen , but someone walked off with the camera and the entire roll of film , " she said . " That was the only bad thing that happened during the games . I wish they would have returned the film . They could have kept the camera. " //
