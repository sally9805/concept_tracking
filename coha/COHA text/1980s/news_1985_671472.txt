There is a certain charm in the respect for tradition , civility and 19th century propriety that exists among the British here , yet one wants to shake Wimbledon by its foundation in an effort to awaken it from a century of slumber . That was almost accomplished on Monday , when a lightning bolt struck the corner of a building in the main complex and created an explosion that many people thought was a bomb. // Because of the recent bomb threats involving airliners and a suspected conspiracy by the Irish Republican Army to plant bombs at several British resorts during the summer , vendors , bartenders and volunteers here have been given specific instructions on how to deal with an emergency - a bomb threat , or possibly an attack . Sometimes , the real world does intrude , and Wimbledon would make an inviting target , but no one here really believes the contingency plans will have to be implemented. // Beyond the entrance gates , London looks just like any big city in the United States . People are in a hurry , dashing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motorists . The air often smells of exhaust fumes . Taxi drivers wax philosophical and speed up and down the narrow streets as if they were competing in the 24 hours of London auto race . Because people drive on the left side of the road , an American can become disoriented , and it adds to the excitement of getting from here to there. // The newspapers are filled with stories of continuing economic problems in England , high unemployment and more restlessness among the young than currently exists in the United States . There was concern about the rowdy behavior of fans at soccer matches even before the tragedy that occurred a month ago in Brussels , when fans of the Liverpool club started a riot that resulted in 38 deaths , most of them fans of the Italian team Juventus . Legislation has been introduced to ban alcohol at soccer matches. // Although the British were embarrassed by what happened in Brussels , the soccer clubs here are appealing a three-year suspension handed down by the European Football Union , which bars them from competing in Europe . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a worldwide problem. // B ut when American sports fans are asked to describe the British , their impressions are invariably colored by what they see and hear about Wimbledon . The rain that washed out all but eight matches the first two days was a disappointment for fans , who are not entitled to a refund or raincheck and usually have waited patiently in line for several hours to be admitted . But they did not react with vulgarity or acts of vandalism . Here was an example of the British stiff upper lip. // Oh , some booed when the referee , Alan Mills , agreed to John McEnroe ' s request to suspend play after only 21 minutes on Monday because of the wet courts , but they were protesting their fate more than admonishing the player called " McNasty " and " Megamouth " in the not-so-civil British tabloids. // " I enjoy the atmosphere here , " said Chris Lewis of New Zealand , who lost to McEnroe in the final two years ago . " It ' s a sporting crowd and knowledgeable. " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sporting event . David Miller , a columnist for The Times of London , wrote that Wimbledon has reached a point where it can take place without tennis . During the lengthy delays of the first two days , fans - whether dressed for the elements or for an evening at the theater - sat on benches in the rain , sipping tea or something with more punch . Some walked the grounds , chatting about the players ' chances and exchanging saucy revelations from the books that Chris Evert Lloyd and Martina Navratilova recently published. // " They are the most patient fans anywhere , " Miss Navratilova said . " When I came out to play the people were so excited to see some tennis. " // Wimbledon has one-way walkways for those moving from court to court and a Viewing Lane where fans press against the barriers waiting for a glimpse of the players as they enter or leave the clubhouse . There are boorish types who talk incessantly during matches on the outer courts - already having had their fill of lager - but they are exceptions. // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of British royalty is given a tour of the facilities . The Duke of Kent visited the American press room on Tuesday. // C hange does come slowly and with great reluctance at Wimbledon . In 1982 , the starting time for matches on the 16 outside courts was moved up from 2 o ' clock to 12 : 30 in the afternoon , because of inevitable rain delays . The men ' s final is now played on a Sunday , much to the disapproval of those who live in the village of Wimbledon and relish their days of rest . But in deference to the villagers , there still are no matches on the first Sunday of the fortnight. // And R. E. H. ( Buzzer ) Hadingham , the chairman of the tournament committee , reaffirmed the other day that Wimbledon has no intention of changing its grass courts to clay , hardcourts or the synthetic grass that will be used in Australia , despite the fact that grass court tournaments are now all but part of the past in tennis. // " What would it be like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // " If they want to kill the tournament , it ' s a good idea to change the surface , " said Mats Wilander , despite having been eliminated in the first round this week . " There ' s a special atmosphere here. " // There are players who gripe about tradition standing in the way of progress and the fact that Wimbledon doesn ' t cater to them as most tournaments do . But it is still the most prestigious tournament in the world , the one they are reluctant to miss . It ' s a chance to pass through the gates to visit a place that really doesn ' t exist anymore. //
