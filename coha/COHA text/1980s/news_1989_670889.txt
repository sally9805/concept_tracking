Take the Lannan Foundation , which has just opened its new headquarters in an industrial park near Santa Monica . The foundation was established in 1960 by the Chicago financier J. Patrick Lannan and bequeathed more than $100 million when he died in 1983 , making it the 70th largest foundation in the country. // One of its recent activities was subsidizing the retrospective of photographs by Robert Mapplethorpe , mounted by the Washington Project for the Arts in Washington after the Corcoran Gallery of Art had canceled it in June , fearing Congressional displeasure. // " We reached out to do that , " J. Patrick Lannan Jr. , the financier ' s son and the president of the foundation , said in a recent interview . " We felt it was such a strong issue of free speech that we had to. " // Frederick R. Weisman , whose sizable holdings in post-World War II art go back to the 1950 ' s , established the Frederick R. Weisman Foundation of Los Angeles in 1982 . Among other activities , the foundation exhibits work from its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ workshops on art-related topics . It recently sponsored one on the growing role of art expositions , bringing the directors of leading fairs in the United States and Europe to Los Angeles to coincide with the Los Angeles art fair. // " In doing this , we are getting information to professionals in contemporary art in ways not usual to university and museum programs , " said Henry Hopkins , the director of the Weisman foundation . <> <> Political and Social Issues // The Eli Broad Family Foundation , established in 1984 by a construction magnate and collector , Eli Broad , and his wife , Edythe , to foster " the serious study of the art of the last quarter of a century , " has set up a lending library of art for borrowing by museums in the United States and abroad . Exposing its holdings to art world professionals at its headquarters , a renovated telephone switching station in Santa Monica , the foundation recently unveiled a show of works from its collection by artists who deal with current political and social issues. // " As a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in working with other institutions , I ' ve learned how cumbersome the acquisition process is , " Mr. Broad said . " The foundation provides a way for museums to borrow the works they want quickly and simply. " // The Peter Norton Family Foundation in Santa Monica , established last year by Peter Norton , a computer-software tycoon , says it dedicates itself to searching out " the new and the innovative . " It has begun to acquire art for donations to museums and to give awards to local curators for buying works of their choice for their own institutions. // While there are other tax-exempt art foundations throughout the country , these Los Angeles benefactors are a relatively new phenomenon in a city that seems to be developing a major art scene . All collect art and all except the Norton Foundation , which is still at its beginning stage , exhibit it . And they are becoming an integral part of the nonprofit network of museums , university galleries and alternative spaces developed here over the years. #1 , 200 Contemporary Works The Lannan Foundation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and storage building , contains a 3 , 000-square-foot main gallery . While it is not yet open to the public , it is to present selections beginning in the summer from the more than 1 , 200 contemporary American and European works assembled by Mr. Lannan mainly by emerging artists who have gone on to develop international reputations. // " It ' s now our mission to refine that collection , and build on its strengths , " said Lisa Lyons , the foundation ' s new curator , who had been a curator of contemporary art at the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis. // A show experimentally installed in the gallery by Ms. Lyons includes works from the 1940 ' s and 50 ' s by Robert Motherwell , Clyfford Still , Ad Reinhardt , Kenneth Noland and more contemporary paintings. // The foundation , which moved here two years ago from Lake Worth , Fla. , near Mr. Lannan ' s house in Palm Beach , has a variety of national programs intended to further the careers of promising and relatively unknown artists , to foster serious criticism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offer new , experimental and provocative art to a wider audience throughout the country . It supported a major show of work by the West German artist Anselm Kiefer at three American museums , with a seed grant of $210 , 000 . The Broad Foundation lent two Kiefer paintings for the exhibition. // The Lannan Foundation differs from the others in that it has a literary arm , directed by Meghan Ferrill , which supports writers , programs and projects that range from Poetry magazine to poetry posters on buses to a newly established series of awards for English-language writers whose work " represents exceptional literary achievement . " <> <> Circulating Exhibitions // The Frederick R. Weisman Foundation - so far endowed with $8 million to $10 million - not only acquires the work of well-known artists , from Barnett Newman and Arshile Gorky to David Hockney and Donald Judd , but it also buys pieces from young and emerging artists from different parts of the world. // It has given up its long search for a museum building to concentrate on circulating shows from its collection of some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in communities that lack access to original contemporary art . While lending works throughout the world , it also donates art to museums across the United States. // " It gets the art out of storage , and gets it seen , " said Mr. Hopkins , the foundation ' s director. // The foundation recently mounted a show at the Virginia Beach ( Va . ) Center for the Arts . In town for the opening , Mr. Weisman and the foundation staff followed their usual practice of buying works by a local artist to give to the institution . In this case , since the Virginia Beach Center does not collect art , the foundation bought several works by a folk painter , Geneva Beavers , for the local public library. // While benefiting artists and institutions , these shows also provide publicity for Mr. Weisman , who flies to the openings with foundation staff members and invited artists in a private jet painted outside and inside by the Los Angeles artists Edward Ruscha and Joe Goode . <> <> ' Quicker Than Language ' // " All my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world closer together , " Mr. Weisman once said . " I don ' t think there ' s anything that communicates better than art . It ' s quicker than language and clearer than philosophy . " An entrepreneur in several areas , the 77-year-old collector is the sole shareholder of Mid-Atlantic Toyota Distributors , one of the country ' s largest Toyota centers. // The foundation is considering a plan to give annual awards of $50 , 000 each to five museums to buy contemporary art chosen by their curators . " It will help give some credibility to curators , whose role is being watered down these days , " Mr. Hopkins said. // At the Broad Foundation building in Santa Monica , the current display - installed by the foundation ' s curator , Michele de Angelus - comprises socially and politically conscious works by such artists as Mr. Kiefer , John Baldessari , Jean Michel Basquiat , Leon Golub , Jenny Holzer and Barbara Kruger . Most of the works may be borrowed by museums around the world , provided they pay shipping and insurance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kaufman &; Broad Home Corporation , an international construction concern , and of Broad Inc. , a financial-services holding company , says it is not his intention to set up a museum . Instead , the foundation has spent more than $10 million on its building and on acquiring some 350 works representing more than 100 artists . By buying their work in depth , it seeks to provide a way for other museums to share in a contemporary collection whose individual paintings most could not afford. // " This past year , we reached an audience of two million through loans to 85 museums and university galleries throughout the United States , the Soviet Union , Europe , Asia and Australia , " Mr. Broad said . The foundation also made 37 acquisitions , including works by Keith Haring , Annette Lemieux , David Salle and Julian Schnabel . <> <> About a Commitment // Some critics of the Broad Foundation ' s collection say that it includes work by only the most fashionable and trendy names , that it does not seek out the work of newer artists and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out that when the foundation began to collect in 1984 , many of its acquisitions were the work of very young artists , among them Jon Kessler , Will Mentor , Tracy Grayson , Bill Komoski , Joan Nelson , Ray Smith and Chuck Connelly. // Ms. de Angelus said : " Individuals whose work we are currently very committed to pursuing , like Christopher Wool , Jonathan Lasker and Christian Eckart , still fit this description . And we are making a larger commitment to certain artists who have continued to hold our attention over a period of time , whose work has become richer and deeper. " // Asked why the foundation did not simply give away the art , Mr. Broad said : " Museums have so little space to show their collections as it is that donated objects could languish in storage . This way , they get what they want when they want it. " // Most museum directors welcome the foundations and their largess . A minority of museum officials , however , who declined to be identified because they deal with the foundations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devices. " // And certainly the foundations produce important tax advantages . As operating foundations that do not simply make grants but like publicly supported museums are actively involved in lending or giving works and arranging shows , they generally enable donors to write off the full value of appreciated property given to the foundations against ordinary income over a period of years. // But while the benefactors gain , the foundations have undeniably been helpful to art institutions and to artists . Speaking of the Weisman foundation , Michael J. Marks , the executive director of the Virginia Beach Center for the Arts , said : " I believe it has a genuine concern to get the work of local artists out to the public . And on the other hand , to see works of the quality they ' ve brought here in their show , our local audience would have to travel to New York , Washington or Chicago. "
