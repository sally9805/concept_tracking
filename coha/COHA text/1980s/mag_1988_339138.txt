Love Medicine ( 1984 ) and The Beet Queen ( 1986 ) introduced Louise Erdrich as a writer with a bold talent and exotic demographics . Both novels drew deeply from her background in North Dakota , where her German-born father and Chippewa mother worked for the Bureau of Indian Affairs . Erdrich 's use of history , legend and experience was sophisticated . She is a 1976 graduate of Dartmouth , where her husband Michael Dorris , who is part Modoc , is a professor in the college 's department of Native American studies . She has a master 's degree in creative writing from Johns Hopkins , a pocketful of literary awards and fellowships , and a seat on the executive board of the U.S. branch of PEN , the international writers ' organization . <P> In short , Erdrich , 34 , is not the sort of woolly regionalist who captivates critics with untamed energy and an earthy style . She seems to have a plan for her career ; she obviously has a blueprint for her imagination . Although set in an earlier time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a projected four-novel cycle that began with Love Medicine and The Beet Queen . Characters from the previous novels appear as youngsters in the new one . The narrative is again moved along by different voices carefully boxed in separate chapters . <P> This time , Erdrich goes to the sources of her saga 's bloodlines . Nanapush , a Chippewa elder born in 1862 , begins with a stark account of an epidemic that devastated his people during the winter of 1912 . " Our tribe unraveled like a coarse rope , frayed at either end as the old and new among us were taken , " he laments . Pauline Puyat , born around the turn of the century , picks up the pace with a fanciful tale about one of the survivors , Fleur Pillager , a young girl who grows to inhabit the book as the central symbol of endurance and revenge . Fleur is also an embodiment of a tribal mythology that includes resurrections , encounters with spirits and lake monsters . By contrast , Pauline , a " skinny big-nosed girl with staring eyes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ancestral beliefs . <P> Historically , Erdrich is writing about a time when her maternal forebears were losing what little land they had left . Nanapush sees his clansmen tempted out of their holdings with quick-cash offers . He remains an eloquent holdout . " Land is the only thing that lasts life to life , " he warns . " Money burns like tinder , flows off like water . And as for government promises , the wind is steadier . " <P> The connections of land to culture and psychology are heavily illustrated with dramatic events and strong imagery . To leave no doubt that Fleur is an avenging witch , Erdrich poses her in front of a boiling vat of animal skulls . A tornado lifts a herd of cattle into the air , where they resemble giant birds , " dropping dung , their mouths opened in stunned bellows . " A moose is tracked , killed and butchered in a snowy wood . The warm meat is then molded to the hunter 's body , where it freezes to resemble marbled blue armor . <P> Girded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people : " They could starve and fornicate , expose their young for dogs and crows , worship the bones of animals or the brown liquor in a jar . I would have none of it . " Nanapush survives , largely because it seems he has been charged by the author to be around in 1924 , when a lumber company starts dropping the trees in whose branches his ancestors once stored their dead .
