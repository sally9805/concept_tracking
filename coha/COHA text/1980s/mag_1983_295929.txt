ON YOUR TOES <P> Music by Richard Rodgers <P> Lyrics by Lorenz Hart <P> Book by Rodgers and Hart and <P> George Abbott <P> In 1936 , when it was the hit of the season , On Your Toes was considered daring , the play that introduced serious dance to the Broadway musical . What was startling then is customary now , and there is only one surprise in this splendid revival , which opened on Broadway last week . It is the unexpected pleasure of seeing how well the old girl has aged and hearing once again some of the loveliest songs that ever bounced off a second balcony . <P> But considering the talents that went into the original , how could it be otherwise ? Richard Rodgers and Lorenz Hart were at the peak of their collaboration ; George Abbott directed ; and George Balanchine did the choreography , most notably the 20-minute jazz ballet Slaughter on Tenth Avenue . Rodgers and Hart are gone , and Balanchine is ill . But Abbott , now 95 , has returned to direct one of the liveliest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let it be said immediately , is silly and dated , constructed of material not strong enough to be considered flimsy . Junior Dolan , the son of two vaudeville dancers , leaves the act , goes to school , and eventually becomes a music professor . As the story gets under way , he tries to persuade a famous Russian ballet company to perform a modern dance by one of his students , Slaughter on Tenth Avenue . The inevitable complications ensue . The prima ballerina ( Natalia Makarova ) makes advances . Poor Frankie Frayne , Junior 's true love , despairs . The ballet 's impresario discovers the professor 's terrible secret-that he lives to dance-and talks him into starring in the climactic number himself . <P> Slight as it is , the plot is yet sturdy enough for Rodgers and Hart to hang on it half a dozen of their most charming songs . There 's a Small Hotel is the best known , but there are also the bittersweet Glad to Be Unhappy , the witty Too Good for the Average Man , the wise and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bluesy Quiet Night . <P> Abbott 's new cast is , for the most part , excellent , and in one case it is inspired . The inspiration is Makarova , who turns out to be not only a great ballerina but a gifted comedian . As the tempestuous Vera Baronova , she is both sexy and sly , and her deli very of a line is droll and almost always unpredictable . It is hard to tell whether she is acting or merely enjoying herself , but in the end it scarcely matters . Her zest is infectious and leaps across the footlights . In other major parts , Christine Andreas is a touching , warm-voiced Frankie , George S. Irving is an amusing impresario , Dina Merrill is silkily elegant as the ballet 's rich sponsor , and George de la Pena is convincing as Makarova 's partner and lover . <P> There are a few disappointments . Lara Teeter , who plays Junior Dolan , sings and dances well enough , but he does not have the personality to carry such a large and important part . Slaughter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scratchy , and Balanchine 's hand is clearly missing . Such faults , however , are far from catastrophic and , given the show 's assets , weigh less than they otherwise might . On Your Toes is no longer a pioneer , but it offers something rarely encountered on Broadway these days : guaranteed enjoyment . - By Gerald Clarke
