In ancient days , before the advent of the Sorth of Bragadox , when Fragilis sang and Saxaquine of the Quenelux held sway , Arthur Dent awoke one morning in his modest home west of London to learn from a visiting extraterrestrial that the earth was about to be demolished . It had to make way for a hyperspace bypass . What happened next is too horrible to recount , but several hundred thousand inhabitants of the planet earth are familiar with the tale . That is a conservative estimate of the audience for Douglas Adams ' 1979 luna tic masterpiece , The Hitchhiker 's Guide to the Galaxy , a 1980 sequel , The Restaurant at the End of the Universe , and a 1982 sequel , Life , the Universe and Everything . The Hitchhiker 's Trilogy , which began as a radio serial , has grown to embrace a television series , record albums , several theatrical productions and a computer software game . As a result of all that furious merchandising , Adams , 32 , a 6-ft. 5-in. , former television script editor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at colleges throughout the galaxy . So Long , and Thanks for All the Fish is billed , with impeccable logic , as the trilogy 's fourth volume . It is the looniest of the lot . <P> Fish chronicles the return of the shy , self-effacing Dent to his home planet after a successful demolition-eve escape . He has spent the intervening eight years hitching rides on passing spacecraft , snacking at duty-free shops on distant planets and encountering such diverse creatures as a lost tribe of ballpoint pens mislaid by former owners , and a race of marketing executives who , despite 573 committee meetings , have still not discovered the wheel ( " All right , Mr. Wiseguy . . . you tell us what color it should be " ) . To Dent 's surprise , earth has somehow escaped destruction , but all the dol phins have mysteriously disappeared . The book 's title , in fact , is their farewell message . He sets out to find them , making new friends , notably a lady whose feet do not quite touch the ground , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ correspondent for the Hitchhiker 's Guide , a 6 million- page Baedeker of the cosmos . Prefect is still updating his entries ; for instance , rediscovering a New York City river " so extravagantly polluted that new life forms were emerging from it spontaneously , demanding welfare and voting rights . " <P> This is an uncharacteristically earthbound performance for Adams , who until now has needed the limitless expanses of the universe to let him leap backward and forward through space , time and meaning . Still , Fish is the best evidence yet that Adams is not simply a funny sci-fi writer but a bomb-heaving satirist . Consider the spaceship that lands in central London , demolishing Harrods and disgorging a robot that demands , " Take me to your Lizard . " On its world , Ford Prefect explains , " the people are people . The lizards are lizards . The people hate the lizards and the lizards rule the people . " The system , he says , is called democracy . But why do the people vote for the lizards ? " Because if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lizard might get in. "
