Forget this week 's meager Tony awards in the Broadway musical category . It has actually been a wonderful year for musicals . Indeed , with just a little stretching of the Tony rules , a whole stageful of prizes could have been bestowed . Best new musical : Zip ! Goes a Million . Best actress : Judy Kaye as the Gay Nineties chanteuse in Sweet Adeline . Best supporting actress : Jane Connell as the inebriated Quaker aunt in Oh , Boy ! Best eccentric dance : Mia Dillon for her daft balloon ballet in Music in the Air . Best orchestrations : John McGlinn for Leave It to Jane . Best book and lyrics : Guy Bolton and P.G . Wodehouse for Oh , Lady ! Lady ! Best composer : Jerome Kern , for all of the above . <P> If the names and titles are unfamiliar , it is because the shows were produced a few blocks from the hoopla of Broadway , on the concert stages of Carnegie Recital Hall and Town Hall . Five of the musicals opened originally on Broadway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Goes a Million , closed out of town in 1919 ( and thus could have been eligible in the Tonys ' " new musical " category ) . All have a witty ebullience that would merit revival even if they did not boast some unforgettable songs : I 've Told Every Little Star , Till the Clouds Roll By , Bill , The Song Is You , We Belong Together , dozens more . But the music is precisely the reason these delightful shows have returned to the spotlight . For this is Jerome Kern 's centenary , which has cued a celebration that promises to last all year and spill over national borders . <P> In the U.S. , the party began in January ( Kern 's 100th birthday was the 27th ) when the Postal Service issued a new 22 cents stamp in his honor . It has kept rolling along with concerts , radio and TV tributes , and retrospectives of Kern films from Show Boat to Swing Time . This week marks the premiere of an off- &; Broadway revue , Ladies and Gentlemen . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the turn of the century to his death in 1945 . In Britain , where the composer met his first stage success ( and his only wife ) , three more revues are wending their way toward the West End . In the past two years , half a dozen new Kern LPs have been released ; recent interpreters of his songs include Joanne Woodward , Kiri Te Kanawa and , mewling All the Things You Are , Michael Jackson . Most of the tributes , though , are lovingly appropriate . They serve less to revive Kern 's music than to offer proof of its enduring vitality . <P> Unlike many Broadway composers of Kern 's day who scrambled to success out of tenements on Manhattan 's Lower East Side , he was born in a comfortable midtown apartment , the son of a German-Jewish stabler . Young Jerry would never be the businessman his father hoped for . Sent out to purchase two pianos , the lad returned with 200 . But he must have known his future would have more to do with sitting at pianos than haggling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ community-theater premiere of his own musical , a parody of Uncle Tom 's Cabin . By the time he was 20 he had placed songs in both Broadway and West End shows . From then on , his personal life was happily uneventful ( " I am a first-class stuffed shirt , " he once said ) , while his professional life was one of unbounded energy and originality . In 1917 alone , Kern composed the scores for five musicals .
