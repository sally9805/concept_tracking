 | In these days of big-budget image and bubble-brained glamour , when a lot of rock acts seem like some wild cross between futuristic cabaret and a circus freak show , the Pretenders break the mold . They 're functional and forthright . Their lead singer and songwriter , Chrissie Hynde , has a scruffy wholesomeness that fits like a frayed sneaker : imagine a girlish free spirit , a defiant biker and a naive , sometimes frightened prima donna , somehow rolled into one . The band 's music ? clever , melodic and adroitly executed ? has an old-fashioned , down-to-earth , bluntness . Its power lies not in any originality but in something that , these days , is even rarer : an air of unaffected integrity , a hint that these songs come straight from the heart . Perhaps that 's one reason why today , five years after the Pretenders first rose to prominence , the British band ( Hynde , the leader , is American ) is more popular than ever . On their current coast-tocoast tour , the Pretenders have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Learning to Crawl " ( Sire ) , currently in the Top 10 , may well be their best seller yet . This success has not come cheaply . Just a few years ago the Pretenders all but disintegrated . Two of the band 's original members died of drug-related causes . Hynde met Ray Davies of the Kinks , fell in love and became pregnant ; she is now raising their 14-month-old baby girl , Natalie . Yet Hynde , 32 , has persevered . A year ago she and Martin Chambers , the band 's charter drummer , reconstituted the Pretenders with Robbie McIntosh on guitar and Malcolm Foster on bass . If anything , the new quartet is playing with mofe conviction than before . Hurling : " Learning to Crawl , " which is only the third Pretenders album , nicely showcases Hynde 's talents . Steeped in the openhearted ethos of ' 60s rock , the music ranges from " Time the Avenger , " a knockout riff , to " Show Me , " a gorgeous hymn to love . But the highlight is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chaos patterned on the Rolling Stones ' " Empty Heart . " Hynde claws at the words , hurling them at the listener : " my past behind me , " " bloody third world , " " do n't harass me , " " I got a kid , I 'm 33 , baby . " The singing is vehement , yet the music feels like a homecoming . In its elemental simplicity and joyous passion , it hits like a revelation : this is what rock and roll is all about ' " I 've never felt so positive about music , " says Hynde , who has been understandably chastened by the last two years . " This is what I 've always wanted to do since I was a kid and this is what every kid in the audience wants to do . I lucked out , because I 'm the one onstage tonight . " Despite a storied temper and a tendency to lurch into jeremiads ? she deplores wasted food , polluted air and the conversion of green fields into paved parking lots ? Hynde @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'm your walking advertisement for apple pie , " she says ? and well she might be , were it not for an old tattoo on her left upper arm , partially scrubbed off with salt . " I discovered that technique in Easyriders magazine , " she explains . " Have you ever seen that ? You 've got to get a copy ! ' Entertainment for the Adult Biker ' ? I still buy it sometimes in London . " Born in Akron , Ohio , in 1951 , Hynde became a lifelong rock-and-roll zealot after hearing the Beatles and the British Invasion . " It was like discovering sex , " she says . " I mean sex in the great sense of the word ? the kind of stuff that makes horses neigh . It 's not that I wanted to go to bed with the Beatles or the Rolling Stones , it 's that I wanted to be like them . They were wild and free , with this sense of adventure ? everything that you want when you 're young . " In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where she quickly made a mark , first as a writer for the pop weekly New Musical Express , then as a protegee of punk-Svengali Malcolm McLaren . Journalist Vivien Goldman , who knew Hynde in those struggling days , has described her old London flat as a kind of Zen-beatnik monastery , furnished only with a rolled-up mattress , a few old snapshots , some incense , a copy of the Bhagavad-Gita and of Jack Kerouac 's " The Dharma Bums " ? " nothing else but the guitar she cooed over , polished , stroked , played at a volume to drive her housemates wild . " Punk gave her an opening : " I had no real facility , " says Hynde . " All I had was an attitude . But with punk , anyone could get up and do it ? it was 100 percent nondiscrimination . If a girl was onstage , people did n't say , Oh , yeah , she 's a good guitar player for a chick ' . " Hynde called her group the Pretenders , after the old Platters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ band with finesse and a singer with soul . Hynde has a broad , nicely controlled vibrato and a rapid-fire declamatory style ? she can spit words like bullets . With her subtly shaded sense of dynamics and timing , she is a master at imbuing lyrics with feeling . She is also an appealing songwriter ? smart , laconic , direct . Songs like " Precious " and " Up the Neck " are memorable not only for the skilled way in which Hynde reworks stock riffs , but also for the matter-of-fact , unsentimental manner in which sex is described from the viewpoint of a woman with appetites and a will of her own . Her best lyrics , at once tender and tough , are a bracing change from rock 's stock erotic fare , which often features a macho stud laying waste to the enemy ? these days , the model seems to be Conan the Barbarian . A recent Pretenders show in Austin , Texas , was , as usual , lean and fierce ? no fog banks , laser beams or fussy sets . Hynde @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with leather pants and studded belt ? a typical blend of tomboy flash and British reserve . Sparked by Chambers , one of the great rock drummers , the band played with precision and intensity , particularly in the reggae-tinged " Waste Not Want Not . " In " Precious , " previously treated as a sullen rant , Hynde displayed a new warmth and sexiness , crouching at the lip of the stage , chatting with the audience , even smiling . Hynde likes to protest that she 's not a " rock ' n ' roll goddess . " But she is , as the show revealed , one of the most exciting phenomena in pop today ? a little fire and smoke in an era of dry ice . @#
