After Congress passes a bill , the President has ten working days to veto it , says the Constitution . He can do so in two ways : 1 ) he can return the measure to Congress unsigned ; or 2 ) if Congress has adjourned , he can do nothing , exercising the pocket veto . Unlike the normal veto , the pocket veto can not be overridden by a two-thirds vote . President Reagan tried one last November . The measure in question was a bill declaring that there should be no military aid to El Salvador unless the President could report improvements in that nation 's human rights record . <P> But last week the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia disallowed Reagan 's pocket veto after hearing a suit brought by 33 House Democrats . Their argument : Congress had not adjourned , but was merely off on a break between sessions , and had designated the House clerk and the Senate secretary to receive any presidential missives . Unless the White House successfully appeals to the Supreme Court , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to El Salvador in military aid since Nov. 30 of last year .
