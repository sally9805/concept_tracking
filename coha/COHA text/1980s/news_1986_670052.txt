Your " Special Report  --  The Corporate Woman " ( March 24 ) hit the bull ' s eye . When I was being courted by a major company , I fell for the " growth-position " line and happily moved into my corporate cubby hole , where I churned out the monthly magazine , news releases , video tapes and the annual report . When I was compiling the statistics for the 1984 Annual Report , I was surprised to find only four news releases announcing women ' s promotions and 71 announcing men ' s promotions , though the percentage of males to females was almost equal among the 4 , 700 employees . The vice president of human resources confirmed the figures . At first he saw nothing amiss , but soon hastened to beef up the figures by adding numerous non-professional appointments , where the figures were slightly better . When I objected to the mixing of apples and oranges , the wording was changed to " . . . more than 200 employees moved to more responsible jobs in 1984 . " Further @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hierarchy revealed that several " eligible women " left each year because they simply were not considered beyond the lowest managerial levels . Furthermore , several lawsuits had been filed by women charging discrimination , though generally they came from even further down in the ranks . ( The professionals seemed to quietly leave for greener pastures . ) But ever vigilant , the company found a solution for that , also . My last act was to prepare a news release announcing the appointment of the first female into the male hierarchy : a young woman lawyer who was to represent the company in affirmative-action matters . As you can see by my letterhead , I am now part of the new breed  --  the female entrepreneur . MAURA BROWN Maura Brown &; Associates Medical Public Relations Casselberry , Fla.  --  - Promotion to senior management is not to be predicated upon the candidate ' s sex , and this is not ultimately subject to the preferences or " problems " of a CEO or other senior executive . It is the law . The irony of the slow movement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , once there , they seem to adopt a prevailing notion that , as good team members , they cannot/should not break ranks and challenge a decision made by " their " company . Far from confirming that they belong , their silence perpetuates their exclusion from consideration for advancement . I think it is possible that encouragement to women executives to challenge acts of illegal discrimination will come from , of all places , the male executives . The growing number of age-discrimination lawsuits by male executives challenging corporate actions such as termination , demotion , reassignment or mandatory retirement at age 65 may inspire other challenges at the executive level . Hopefully , it will not be too long before executive women are willing to recognize blatant sex discrimination for what it is , and begin demanding and enjoying the full protection of the law . LYNNE E. DISTASIO New York  --  - For the last 30 years I have spoken to students in most of the leading business schools in the country . When I started , only 1% or 2% of the classes were women , whereas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leading schools such as Harvard and Stanford . It is my feeling that the lack of women CEOs and other top executives in large companies has been due to the lack of educational background in the past . When I now talk to classes , I predict that within the next 20 years , some of the women in the class will be CEOs of publicly owned corporations . I will admit that I do not get tremendous applause from the men when I make this prediction . ROYAL LITTLE Providence , R.I.  --  - Congratulations on your excellent report . It was an interesting and well balanced overview that covered a good deal of ground in a positive manner . I will take the report with me to London to the Triennial Conference of the International Council of Women in April and undoubtedly the women from the national councils of the 75 countries represented there will be interested in the attention paid by the Journal to the changing role of women in the U.S. ELEANOR LEWIS DONNENFELD President , National Council of Women New York  --  - Everything has changed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe romance is only in the female domain . Would you have featured " The Perils of Office Romance " in a special report entitled " The Corporate Man " ? DARLEEN GRAY Pueblo West , Colo.
