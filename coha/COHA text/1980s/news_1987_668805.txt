Chicago Tribune columnist Andrew Leckey , who writes Table about personal finance , is the author of " Make Money with the New Tax Laws , " published by Bonus Books . In the third of five excerpts , he discusses individual retirement accounts . Although dramatic changes have been made in IRAs , money can still be made with them . Next : Homes and Home Equity Loans . The new tax laws prop up the popular notion that owning a home is truly an American dream and the best tax shelter for most Americans . " They took away my IRA . " <> That ' s the battle cry of many Americans these days . Had tax reformers done less in the way of changing tax brackets but simply kept the individual retirement account deduction intact for all workers , they might be considered heroes right now . Americans , you see , got downright proud of their IRAs . I ' ve heard from hundreds of readers the last few years from all income levels who were either seeking advice about their IRAs or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IRAs . Those accounts became as American as apple pie , turning saving into an organized pastime . The beauty of the IRA was that it was so simple . Financial institutions were battling for your business in earnest , with the blessing of Uncle Sam to boot . Not that a few folks didn ' t get a little mixed up even in the old days . Once a fellow worker of mine and several colleagues were talking over financial matters when he mentioned how he ' d been getting his financial house in order . " Those IRAs are great , " he said enthusiastically . " I think so much of them that I ' ve opened one for each of my children . " He was immediately pummeled by his chums , who shouted that he was a " dope " for mistakenly opening those accounts for his pre-teen brood . Because of compromise and the fact that it offered a quick-fix of additional revenues to a nation saddled with a massive federal deficit , the IRA isn ' t so simple anymore . It ' s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which folks won ' t take the time to figure out , and because it won ' t apply equally to everyone . " After the same number of IRA investments as usual for the 1986 tax year , we feel they may pretty much peter out , " predicted one executive of a big New York bank . IRAs have never turned out to be as big money-makers as financial institutions had hoped . Investors were fickle , willing to move accounts for a better interest rate or bonus or promise of big stock gains . But they did bring in plenty of money that institutions hope to retain . The IRA , of course , isn ' t dead . You can still make money with it , considerably more than if the investment money was in a taxable investment . Workers not covered by a retirement plan can still deduct up to $2 , 000 a year in IRA contributions from income on federal returns ( $2 , 250 for one-income couples ) . A worker with a company pension and up to $25 , 000 in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couple , can continue deducting $2 , 000 a year . Then things get complicated . Americans making $25 , 000 to $35 , 000 or couples making $40 , 000 to $50 , 000 receive a lesser deduction . But those at the end of that range will be allowed a minimum deduction of $200 even if the formula would provide less . Taxpayers with incomes above $50 , 000 on a joint return and $35 , 000 on single returns will not be entitled to a deduction , and for married couples it won ' t be possible to get around that even by filing separate returns . They can , however , continue contributing and receive a tax deferral . One mutual fund company sent out more than 1 million mailings to customers about the fact that tax-deferred compounding is still " a good thing . " Assume a $2 , 000 annual contribution over a 25-year period , with a 28 percent tax bracket and a healthy 10 percent investment return , it pointed out . A tax-deferred IRA with no deduction would eventually total $216 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same return would reach only $155 , 782 . Both deductible and nondeductible IRAs will outperform regular savings accounts in the long run . However , the old belief that you were still ahead putting money in an IRA even if you pulled your money out after six years and paid the penalties isn ' t quite the same . In the case of the nondeductible IRA , that time period has now been stretched to about 12 years . Under the new law , stock investments in IRAs may become more popular because the preferential capital gains treatment is eliminated and all stock market profits will be taxed at regular rates ; the IRA will provide one place where taxes on those profits can be deferred for years . So , while the IRA isn ' t what it used to be , it is well worth considering . There is no denying , however , that many people will opt instead for competing products such as tax-exempt municipal bonds , single-premium whole life insurance , tax-deferred annuities and company 401(k) plans . That ' s one reason why many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tie-in to saving on a regular basis for many Americans . Though the IRA has been the " big daddy " of retirement plans , it is important for self-employed workers to keep in mind that they may still set up , in addition to an IRA , a Keogh plan in which they may take an annual deduction of up to $30 , 000 . In the case of a profit-sharing plan , the deduction is limited to the lesser of $30 , 000 or 13 percent of net self- employment income . For a money-purchase pension plan , the limitation is the lesser of $30 , 000 or 20 percent of net self-employment income . A defined- benefit plan may provide a deduction as high as 100 percent of net self- employment income . Since tax law changes haven ' t blunted its features and because there are fewer shelters around now , a Keogh makes sense if you qualify . Besides IRAs , consumer credit is another big change in the new tax laws . Americans have a loaded gun pointed at their credit cards . It ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deductions for interest over five years . Painful as it may be , this is exactly what some folks needed . For example , a budget was being worked out for a client by a financial planner , carefully going over each and every detail of daily living expenses . But after perusing the information supplied , the adviser noticed no allotment for spending on clothing . " You ' ll really have to realistically figure on spending some money on clothes this year , " the planner said . The client shook her head . " No need to , " she said with a shrug . " I charge all my clothes . " A highly paid professional couple that I know pays for virtually everything with credit cards . A $2 drink after work , if the establishment won ' t accept plastic for such a small amount , or a cab fare always mean borrowing a few greenbacks from those around them . As sophisticated as the American consumer has become , many people still don ' t think of credit cards as money . Apart from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system in which one can no longer deduct the interest , there is also the fact that the return on basic investments is low these days , making high-interest debt even more onerous . Savvy credit-watchers are seeking out the best deals . At the very least , this should mean shopping among four or five local financial institutions to compare rates and annual fees . For those who are really serious , it might mean looking for a card from a rate-conscious out-of-state institution . This requires contacting the bank for an application and going through the same credit check you ' d undergo at a local institution . " We ' ve been dealing with a public misconception that all fees and interest rates are alike , plus the mistaken belief that credit cards from smaller or out-of-state banks aren ' t as widely accepted , " said Elgie Holstein , associate director of the nonprofit Bankcard Holders of America in Washington , D.C. " The fact is , the location of the bank where you have your credit card doesn ' t really make a difference anymore . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , has a constitutional provision setting the ceilings at 5 percent above the federal discount rate.
