If he hopes to step out from Brezhnev 's shadow , Yuri Andropov will have to re-make the Communist Party in his own image . A key for the new General Secretary will be to place his own people at the top of the tentacular bureaucracy that carries out the will of the Kremlin leadership . Long excluded from the corridors of power during the Brezhnev era , a generation of party officials in their 40s and 50s will be carefully watching whom Andropov is able to put in important posts in the coming weeks and months . These choices will affect not only Andropov 's future but the stability of the cumbersome system of power he has inherited . <P> The most pressing vacancies are in the Politburo . At the beginning of the year , the ruling body of the Communist Party had 14 voting members , an enshrined gerontocracy whose average age was 70 . The death last January of Party Ideologue Mikhail Suslov , 79 , lowered the count by one , and last week , as the nation 's attention was focused on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Disciplinarian Arvid Pelshe , 83 , had also died . If Party Secretary Andrei Kirilenko , 76 , is on the way out , as the cold reception he was accorded at the Tammany Hall , Soviet-Style <P> Brezhnev rites suggests , Andropov could conceivably fill as many as four seats with his own supporters . He may enlist some " younger " recruits among the nine nonvoting members of the Politburo , including Heavy Industry Specialist Vladimir Dolgikh , 57 , and Cultural Watchdog Pyotr Demichev , 64 . <P> The highest decision-making body in the Soviet Union , the Politburo functions like a super-Cabinet that charts both foreign and domestic policy behind closed doors . Its membership includes representatives of the government like Defense Minister Dmitri Ustinov , 74 , and Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko , 73 , as well as key functionaries in the party bureaucracy such as Konstantin Chernenko , 71 , and a handful of republic and urban party leaders like Moscow Boss Viktor Grishin , 68 . The new General Secretary will have to appoint known loyalists if he hopes to prevail in Politburo debate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the Central Committee Secretariat , the Moscow bureaucracy that manages the day-to-day affairs of the party . Officials who hold jobs in both the Secretariat and the Politburo , like Agriculture Specialist Mikhail Gorbachev , 51 , wield the most clout . Andropov and his colleagues are answerable in theory to the Central Committee , a body made up of 308 voting and 147 nonvoting members who represent a cross section of the nation . In practice , the Politburo and the Central Committee Secretariat exercise limitless power in running the Soviet Union . <P> If he follows the lead of his predecessors , Andropov may also go after a post in the government . Brezhnev assumed the job of President of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet in 1977 , thus becoming titular head of state . Both Stalin and Khrushchev held the post of Premier or Chairman of the Council of Ministers .
