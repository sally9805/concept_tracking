Shultz . At that time , State , Central Intelligence Agency and Defense officials agreed Mr. Marcos had to go , but could not be left in limbo as the Shah of Iran had been. // Mr. Reagan ' s personal message was designed to assure Mr. Marcos that he would not become an international wanderer if he left the Philippines without bloodshed , and was believed by American officials to be a major role in persuading a very reluctant Mr. Marcos to finally leave on Tuesday. // Amplifying and in some cases correcting the record on what happened in the hectic few days leading up to Mr. Marcos ' s departure from the Philippines Tuesday , the officials said Mr. Reagan sent two personal messages to Mr. Marcos on Sunday . The first , disclosed that day by the White House , was sent by Mr. Reagan from Camp David and said " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to remain in power. // // Safe Haven Offered // The second , and more important message , offering Mr. Marcos a safe haven in this country , was drafted after a White House meeting that afternoon with his senior advisers , Administration officials disclosed today. // It was at that session that Mr. Reagan said " I agree " to Secretary of State Shultz ' s conclusion that Mr. Marcos could no longer rule the Philippines and that the time had come to invite him to the United States in a dignified and respectful manner , and not to treat him as poorly as the Carter Administration had treated the Shah of Iran. // A participant in those meetings said today that senior American officials were determined that Mr. Marcos should be given every courtesy as an American ally through five Administrations . " We were all thinking about the Shah ' s miseries and agreed that this would not happen to Marcos. " // But Mr. Marcos , he said , was aware not so much of the Shah ' s fate , but rather that of another former @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of South Vietnam , until he was assassinated during a coup in 1963 . " Marcos had Diem on his mind at all times , " one official said . " He was very concerned about how he would leave his palace . He wanted to make sure he did not leave with a bullet .

Habib , the special representative who had just returned . At that meeting , after a lengthy discussion , officials said , Mr. Shultz won the concurrence of the other participants to these conclusions that would be presented to Mr. Reagan later that day : // * Mr. Marcos ' s ability to govern with the consent of his people had ended. // * If he uses force to try to crush the opposition forces then led by Defense Minister Juan Ponce Enrile and the deputy chief of staff , Lieut . Gen. Fidel V. Ramos , this would sharply reduce the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great importance to the United States that force not be used. // * It would be very damaging to United States standing in the world if Mr. Marcos was treated like the Shah . <> <> Gathered at Shultz ' s House // Those at Mr. Shultz ' s house besides Mr. Habib were Defense Secretary Caspar W.

Kissinger and David Rockefeller criticizing the Carter Administration for treating the old American ally as , in Mr. Kissinger ' s words , " a Flying Dutchman , " a legendary ship that was doomed to sail forever. // Eventually , after staying in the Bahamas and Mexico , the Shah was permitted to enter the United States for medical treatment , a move which led to the seizure of the American Embassy in Teheran , Iran . The Carter Administration then virtually forced the Shah to go to Panama , from where he went to Egypt , before he died in 1980. // Mr. Reagan who was at Camp David last weekend , was told at about noon on Sunday of reports that troops loyal to Mr. Marcos might use force . He then dictated a personal message to Mr. Marcos that was flashed to Ambassador Stephen Bosworth , who read it to Mr. Marcos .

A personal message was drafted that said that Mr. Reagan " looked forward to President Marcos ' s working out a scenario for a transition government . " It said that Mr. Marcos , his family and close associates would be welcome in the United States .
