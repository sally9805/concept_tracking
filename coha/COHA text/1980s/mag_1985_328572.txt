Finally , after three tense days , the barricades came down . Some 70 South Korean students who had shut themselves in the second-floor library of the U.S. Information Service building in downtown Seoul decided to call it quits , partly because of exhaustion and partly because of the quiet mediation of U.S. embassy officials . But as the students left , just after noon Sunday , each wore a white headband with the inscription DOWN WITH MILITARY DICTATORSHIP . <P> The days of siege began last Thursday with students drifting in ones and twos into the library . To the security guards on duty in the four-story former U.S. embassy building , everything seemed normal . A block away , police officers showed no concern when some other well-dressed young people began to collect in a passageway under the City Hall Plaza . Then , without warning , the youths rushed up from the passageway and began racing toward the building , flinging rocks and bottles at startled policemen . Surging inside , they joined the students already in the second-floor library and announced that they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were requested to leave , and the unarmed students barricaded the doors with bookshelves . <P> From their fortified redoubt , they unfurled banners out the window ( U.S. STOP SUPPORT OF THE MILITARY DICTATORSHIP , read one ) . They also scattered leaflets that condemned both the U.S. and the government of President Chun Doo Hwan . As 400 policemen surrounded the building , U.S. embassy officials moved to prevent a violent counterattack by reminding the government that Korean forces could not legally enter a U.S. diplomatic building . Calmly inviting U.S. diplomats inside for face-to-face conversations , the students delivered demands that centered on U.S. withdrawal of support from the Chun regime . Unless their appeals were met , they warned , they would begin a hunger strike to the death . All the while , the students impressed American observers with their composure in executing the well-planned operation . U.S. officials supplied the students with salt , bottled water and , as the protesters ' resolve wore down , with sandwiches , vegetables and milk . <P> Student criticism of Chun , increasingly vocal in recent months , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 1980 uprising at Kwangju , 200 miles south of Seoul , in which thousands of students took over the provincial capital to protest the declaration of martial law . After South Korean troops moved in to put down the Kwangju uprising , 191 people were killed , according to the official count . Other estimates put the toll as high as 1,000 . The U.S. , say Washington officials , approved the sending of only one of the divisions that brutally recaptured the city . Nonetheless , some critics of the Chun government still hold the U.S. partly accountable for the slaughter . To many of Chun 's opponents , Kwangju has become a symbol of the U.S.-supported regime 's determination to rule by force , abolishing political parties and cracking down on enemies in every area . The government has explicitly prohibited newspapers from mentioning the 1980 uprising . Last week 's student protest came just one day after the government refused to consider an inquiry into the episode .                    @
