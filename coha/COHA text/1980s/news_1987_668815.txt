If you believe the hype that perennials are the " in " thing to grow , then you ' ll want to have the most " in " perennial in your garden . Surprise ! " The perennial plant of the ' 80s " ( according to a recent garden symposium in Williamsburg , Va. ) is the hosta , which has been decorating home landscapes since the turn of the century . Hostas are those plants you see lurking in dark recesses under trees , where they look like houseplants that got out of bounds . That image is changing rapidly , however . New introductions of hostas allow the gardener to choose from a tiny accent plant right up to something that would appear to be a small shrub , in foliage colors from yellow to blue-green and with innumerable combinations of leaf shapes and variegations . Flower sizes are larger than earlier types , and fragrance , once confined to just a few species , is now a feature in many hostas . Hostas are perennials  --  those landscape creatures that are supposed to survive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with virtually no work once they ' re planted . The allure of perennials increases every year , as American gardeners are drawn by their supposed effortless growing and by the beauty and range of flowers . The nursery industry has been able to meet the demand by cloning plants in test tubes , which can create 10 , 000 new plants in the time it takes to grow one plant large enough to split into six or eight divisions  --  and far faster than the time it takes to grow plants from seed . Hostas ' place at the top of this heap may be the view of a botany professor in need of a subject for a symposium talk , but others who are not necessarily pushing hostas don ' t scoff at the notion . The new varieties are creating renewed interest in this venerable plant . Hostas have always been a staple at the Planter ' s Palette , a nursery in Winfield run by Dave Tyznik and hosta lover Mark Zilis . Zilis propagates 250 types of plants in his tissue-culture lab , including 100 varieties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ varieties since its formation in 1981 . " Hostas are being used more now because homes that previously had sunny yards are now shady , as the trees and shrubs have grown up and they need plants for shade , " Zilis says . " They were introduced into the Western world in the 1830s from China and Japan , mostly Japan . They were brought to the U.S. in the late 1800s and became popular in the early 1900s . " But there were only the basic six or eight varieties , and they became looked upon as old-fashioned . You could find only two types , green and variegated . " Interest picked up after World War II , and the American Hosta Society was formed in 1968 . Today , there are 1 , 000 members . In the 1960s , there were fewer than 100 types of hostas available in the world , Zilis says , while today 1 , 500 varieties can be obtained . Yet many nurseries carry the common six or eight varieties that have been available for decades , he says . Zilis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s hostas . " The most popular now are the white-margined and blue-green leafed , " he says . " Besides color , I look for substance  --  how thick the leaf is  --  because the No. 1 pest of hostas is slugs . They feed on the thinner-textured leaves , but they don ' t bother the thick leaves . " Leaf shape also varies widely , from thin or lance-shaped to ovate-shaped to almost circular . Some leaves are corrugated or rippled , some flat and smooth , and a few are shiny . Flowers appear on hostas anywhere from early June to October , depending on the type , Zilis says . " Mid-July is the average . The sieboldiana types flower in June ; fragrant ones , in August ; the lancifolias , in September ; and some of the species , in October . " Colors range from a pure white through the lavenders to deep purple . Finding the right site for a hosta is one of the most important aspects of planting . Zilis says the best place is open shade , a place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dappled sunlight . " Most can tolerate one to two hours a day of direct sun without damage . Three to four hours can burn the leaves of most types , " Zilis says . " The ideal environment is a soil heavily amended with organic matter like peat moss . I go heavy on it , using about 8 cubic feet per 100 square feet of bed dug to 8 to 12 inches deep . " Soil compaction and drying out during summer are two major problems that restrict the growth of hostas . The peat moss helps aerate the soil while providing moisture retention for dry spells . " They benefit greatly from heavy fertilization , " Zilis says . " Some members of the hosta society say the best is decomposed horse manure , but I ' ve never used it . I use something like a 5-10-5 or superphosphate . Initially they need a lot of organic matter and fertilizer . After that , fertilize once in the spring . " Once planted , hostas will live for years . They can be moved almost any time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provided . The best times are spring and fall . Their uses in the landscape are varied , from edgings to accents in a rock garden up to singular specimens and  --  the largest ones  --  as backgrounds . " Golden-leafed types are underused , and they have a lot of advantages , " Zilis says . " They can really brighten a shady area , especially in the late afternoon and at dusk . They really stand out then . " Hosta plants are widely available now in either quart or gallon pot sizes , depending on the eventual size of the plant . While most of the hostas at the Planter ' s Palette are priced from $4 to $8 , Sweet Standard , a Zilis introduction , commands $50 per plant . Because most hostas start their growth in April , the plants currently at nurseries should give shoppers a good idea of leaf color and shape . The old standbys that are still found widely are Hosta lancifolia ( " The No. 1 landscape hosta of all time , " Zilis says . " There are miles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Hosta undulata ' Albo-marginata . ' One of the newest and most promising types , Zilis says , is the tardianas , a cross between the sieboldianas and the tardifolias . " It ' s a key one to watch for . If it ' s in the name , you ' re sure it ' s a good hosta , " he says . There are about 35 varieties in various stages of development ; Blue Dimples is the cultivar the Planter ' s Palette carries . Zilis , who is writing a book about hostas , is hard pressed to narrow down his favorites , but he singles out several as the " all-time best " :  --  H.
