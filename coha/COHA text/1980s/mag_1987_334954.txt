The scene at Detroit 's sprawling , gritty Redford High School seemed like a % real-life replay of Blackboard Jungle . Throngs of students , some armed with knives , roamed the graffiti-covered halls , smoking marijuana , playing touch football and frequently fighting . Only about half the mostly black student body of 2,800 showed up for classes on any given day . The school 's administrators had lost control . No wonder a monitoring commission set up by a federal court described Redford as the worst high school in Detroit . <P> That was before Joe Greene arrived three years ago to take over as principal . Greene , a soft-spoken Mississippian with 18 years in the Detroit school system , four of them as principal of another problem high school , had a nickname  --  " Mean Joe Greene , " after the Hall of Fame pro-football star . He showed right away that he was prepared to live up to it . Among the stiff rules he began enforcing : three unexcused absences would mean suspension , each subsequent truancy would mean another suspension @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transferred out of Redford . " I 've heard a lot about Redford , basically all bad , " he told the students . " We 're going to try to change all that , with your help . Now I know some of you wo n't do that . The rules are for you . " <P> Two weeks later Greene and his staff made a surprise sweep of the corridors , rounding up 400 students who were loitering after classes had begun . All of them were suspended and sent home with letters requesting that their parents meet with Greene before the students could be allowed to return . In his first semester , Greene handed out 2,000 suspensions and ordered 100 transfers . Students got the message . By the end of Greene 's first year , classroom attendance had risen from 56% to 85% . With a measure of order and calm restored , Greene went to work on academics . In 1985 he canceled Redford 's football season because 17 of the school 's 26 players had failed to maintain a 2.0 grade average . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , holding periodic honors assemblies to recognize their achievements , with parents invited . <P> Today many students who left Redford for parochial or other schools have transferred back , swelling enrollment to 3,450 . The school 's once moribund parent organization has grown from ten members in 1984 to about 50 . Greene , says English Teacher Janet Bobby , " built a structure around the school so everybody could be free . " Although students have complained incessantly about Greene 's disciplinarian ways , and in February tried unsuccessfully to stage a protest , many take pride in the school 's new image . Says Junior Natalie Bien- Ami , 16 : " We 're not gunmen , we 're smarties . "
