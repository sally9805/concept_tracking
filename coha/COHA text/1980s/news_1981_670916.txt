Members and staff of the President ' s Task Force on Immigration and Refugee Policy said today that the Cabinet-level body would probably advise the President within the next two weeks to pursue a policy combining two or more of these elements : // - Legislation authorizing the Coast Guard to intercept boats carrying Haitians to the United States so that the Haitians could be returned to their homeland or taken to some other country . The boats might be stopped in international waters. // - Legislation to expedite deportation and exclusion proceedings so that claims for asylum could be disposed of more quickly , with fewer levels of appeal and review. // - Detention of any additional Haitians or Cubans who arrive in southern Florida without visas . This would prevent the aliens from disappearing inside the country while awaiting deportation or official action on claims for asylum. // - Legislation to legalize the status of at least some of the Cuban and Haitian " boat people " already here so that they could remain indefinitely. // David D. Hiller , a special assistant to Attorney General @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ study , but he said that nothing had been sent to the President . The Attorney General is chairman of the task force , which includes the secretaries of seven other Cabinet departments. // The panel was to submit its report to the President May 4 , but it may require another week to complete its work . Frank S.M. Hodsoll , a Presidential aide who is also a member of the task force , said today he doubted that the report would be made public. // The panel was established by Mr. Reagan on Feb. 27 to review the proposals of another study group , the Select Commission on Immigration and Refugee Policy , headed by the Rev. Theodore M. Hesburgh . The work of the select commission reflected to some extent the policies of President Carter , who had appointed 8 of its 16 members. // The Hesburgh commission recommended a one-time amnesty for most illegal aliens , an increase in Border Patrol strength along the Mexican border and civil and criminal penalties for employers who hire illegal aliens in the future. // The boldest step being studied by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the high seas , probably in the strait between Haiti and the Bahamas . The Haitians have been arriving in south Florida at a rate of more than 1 , 000 a month since January 1980 . <> <> Boats Would Be Searched // Under this proposal , boats would be stopped and searched for evidence of intent to violate United States immigration laws . Refugee claims would be adjudicated aboard a Coast Guard vessel . Those not eligible to enter the United States would be returned to Haiti , assuming the Haitian Government would accept its citizens , as it has in the past. // In a formal opinion for the Attorney General , the Justice Department ' s Office of Legal Counsel has said that although there was no precedent for such an operation the President had the necessary power , arising in part from his authority in the field of foreign affairs. // However , Justice Department lawyers said the President ' s hand would be strengthened if he had an explicit mandate from Congress . The department has thus prepared a first draft of legislation that would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ territorial limits of the United States , with respect to aliens coming to this country. // Transportation Department officials have privately expressed reservations about such an operation , contending that it might divert Coast Guard resources from drug enforcement , search-and-rescue missions and other activities . The interdiction program would cost at least $10 million to $15 million a year , according to Coast Guard estimates . <> <> A Bad Example for Others // In addition , some officials say that if the United States turned away Haitian " boat people " it would set a bad example for countries in Southeast Asia . The United States has repeatedly urged those nations to live up to their obligations as countries of " first asylum " by accepting Indochinese refugees arriving by boat. // Haitians account for less than 2 percent of all illegal immigration to the United States , according to Justice Department estimates . The President ' s task force has apparently not made firm decisions about how to deal with the other sources of illegal immigration. // The State Department maintains that the vast majority of the Haitian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ island for economic rather than political reasons . Haiti is the poorest country in the hemisphere , with a per capita income of less than $300 a year. // The State Department rejects the contention of most Haitians that they would face persecution if sent home . Under the Refugee Act of 1980 , the legal test for asylum is whether an alien has a " wellfounded fear of persecution " upon return to the homeland . <> <> Old Practice Is Reconsidered // Another step being studied by the task force is detention of illegal aliens who arrive in southern Florida . This would resume a practice discontinued in November 1977 . Since then , boat people arriving without visas have been released into the community and given work permits while awaiting official action on their asylum claims . Federal officials note that the influx of illegal aliens has increased substantially since 1977. // The task force directed the Attorney General to make an inventory of sites available for use as refugee camps or detention facilities . Justice Department officials acknowledged that a large-scale effort to detain and deport Haitians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a Federal judge in July . Judge James Lawrence King of Miami ruled that thousands of Haitians seeking political asylum had been denied due process of law because of a selective , discriminatory policy followed by Federal immigration officials in 1978 and 1979 . He ordered the Government to reprocess all the asylum claims . The Government has appealed his decision . <> <> Judge Tells of Persecution // Judge King said in his 179-page opinion that many of the people expelled from the United States were " imprisoned and persecuted " when they were returned to Haiti. // In a meeting April 15 at the White House , the task force also agreed to recommend legislation giving the Cubans and Haitians legal status as permanent residents after they have lived here for two years. // Task force officials said that such legislation was necessary as a practical matter because most of the Cubans and Haitians had already been resettled . But they expressed concern that it might encourage further illegal migration and could be seen as inequitable to other aliens such as the Mexicans , Nicaraguans and Salvadorans. <> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . , April 27 ( AP ) - Forty-eight Haitian refugees packed into a small sailboat arrived today at the Customs Service dock at the Port of Palm Beach , officials said. //
