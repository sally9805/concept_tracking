G.O.P. dilemma : Why ca n't a woman vote more like a man ? <P> <P> To most Americans , the letters GG are recognizable only as the links on stylish men 's loafers or the imprint on pricey women 's handbags . <P> But to politicians , the initials stand for the most fashionable topic among pollsters today : the " gender gap " between men and women voters . That difference is expected to play a meaningful role in the November balloting . Says Pollster Louis Harris : " Women are as pivotal as any single group in this election . " <P> In the past many women followed the voting lead of fathers and husbands . But by 1980 , politicized by ten years of struggling to ratify the Equal Rights Amendment and ever increasing experience in the work force , women were making up their own minds . Pollsters who interviewed people as they came out of voting booths that fall noticed that significantly more women than men disapproved of Ronald Reagan ; at the time , the disparity was attributed to his opposition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ according to Harris , women supported Democratic candidates over Republicans by 52% to 48% ; men favored Democrats by 54% to 45% . Samplings of voters since then show that the gender gap was not just a response to Reagan or particular issues in the 1980 campaign . Indeed , a Harris survey last month revealed the gender gap had widened considerably , with women ( 53% of all registered voters ) preferring Democratic candidates 53% to 38% and men backing them 46% to 44% . Analysts note that women generally have favored the more social service-oriented Democrats . But now , says Harris , " women are deserting the Republicans in droves . " If the Democrats pick up 15 to 25 House seats ( the average for the party out of power in mid-term elections since World War II is twelve ) , Harris says , " a surge of women toward Democrats may be among the top two or three reasons for that gain . " <P> The disenchantment of women with Republicans now goes beyond Reagan 's stance on the traditional feminist issues . By an average @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men to decry the Reagan Administration 's opposition to a nuclear arms freeze and its attempts to cut social welfare programs . Their foremost concern is the economy , and again they are more critical of Republican policies than are men . Explains Pollster Peter Hart : " Women are more economically sensitive than men . They are new to the job market . "
