In fact , though , he is scraping it . It ' s in the coral that he finds the algae on which he feeds. // So what does that have to do with the beach ? In taking the algae , the parrotfish also takes part of the skeleton of the coral itself ; you ' ll find the scrape marks all over the reef . He digests the algae , but the coral later passes out of his body as a fine sediment . . . sand. // One parrotfish chews on so much coral yearly that he makes some 30 pounds of sand . Multiply that by the number of parrotfish - they are among the most numerous of the species here - and you can pretty well credit them as builders of the beaches. // Still , fine as their handiwork is , it is not the sand , gleaming invitingly in the Tropic of Capricorn sun , that draws most people to this area . It ' s the reef . The reef is one of the seven natural wonders of the world. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 250 miles , not in one long unbroken chain , but in a series of them , interspersed with shoals , cays , and islands , all formed of coral . It buffers the northeast coast of the continent from the thundering waves rolled toward it when the southeast trade winds blow on the Pacific Ocean. // The reef was officially discovered by Capt . James Cook in 1770 , when his ship , Endeavor , foundered on it . ( His isn ' t the only ship to have run aground here . More than 500 have done so since , including , in 1791 , the HMS Pandora , which was bound for England from Tahiti with 14 of the Bounty ' s mutineers aboard. ) // Wavy coral , staghorn coral , brain coral , soft coral - the conditions are just right for their growth : water that ' s 68 degrees F. or warmer and seas shallow enough to allow sunlight to penetrate. // These same conditions make it just right for viewing. // Heron Island is just one of the islands within the Great Barrier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a motel-style resort here , plus some additional lodges ; in all there are accommodations for about 200 people . You can rent diving equipment ( be sure to bring your proficiency certificate ) or you can snorkel . Rides in glass-bottomed boats are available , too. // When you first see it , you will wonder that anyone at all could shelter here . Heron Island is only 40 acres in area - 300 yards across and 11/4 miles in circumference . Even so , it is temporary home not only to tourists but to touring birds by the thousands , including the reef heron , for which it is named ; various terns ; brown boobies ; red-footed boobies ; ospreys ; lesser frigates ; and wedge-tailed shearwaters ( muttonbirds ) . // The latter burrow near the roots of the pisonia trees that shade the island , and they hold nightly concerts of raucous calls . Be careful on any walks that you don ' t stumble into their nests. // You can walk around the island in little more than half an hour if exercise is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ll ramble here , maybe stopping at the marine science research facility that shares the island with the resort or to view the birds in their fishing forays or to admire a beach morning glory. // If you come between October and April and like to do your rambling at night ( bring a flashlight ) , you can watch the green turtles come ashore to lay their eggs . The 500-pound reptiles proceed up the beach with a kind of sand-slowed breast stroke . When they find a spot that suits them , they scoop out a hole with their front flippers , turn around , drop 20 to 50 ping-pong-ball-size eggs in it , cover the eggs with sand propelled by a few swishes of their powerful back flippers , and lumber back into the water. // It ' s hard to believe , watching them on land , that in the water marine turtles are graceful creatures. // On any walk here you ' ll want firm-soled footgear - tennis shoes or rubber boots ; some of the shore is covered with white coral sand , but much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and very sharp coral. // It ' s good to cover your feet in the water , too , since there you will find even more coral. // The coral of the Great Barrier Reef comes in an artist ' s palette of colors - blue , fuschia , purple , pink . And the fishes it harbors look as if they have been painted specially for exhibit : The clown fish is orange with a white face . With the simple addition of a red bulbous nose , it could perform for Ringling Bros. and Barnum &; Bailey . The angelfish has blue and gold bands . The harlequin tuskfish is red striped , and the moorish idol adds splashes of yellow , black , and white to this watery canvas. // The fishes aren ' t interesting only for their color , though . They seem to come in an infinite variety of shapes and characteristics . The trumpet fish , long and lean , vacuums up its prey . The butterfly fish has an ' ' eye ' ' spot near the tail meant to fool predators into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orange spots and a protruding mouth - it ' s obvious how it got its name . The damselfish is tiny but pugnacious . It will come right up and stare into your face mask . If it were any bigger , you ' d have to be scared . You are scared of the porcupine fish - ouch ! No problem figuring out how it got its name , either. // There are more than 1 , 000 varieties of fishes to be seen here , and for most you don ' t have to be a deep diver . A snorkel mask and a gentle patrol of the waters just offshore and the neighboring reefs and islands will be enough . Or there are the glass-bottomed boats ( better than nothing , but not as good as snorkeling or diving ) . // Sometimes the tidepools on the eastern side of the island elicit treasures , as well . The tide recedes with a swirl of foam , leaving behind sea anemones and mollusks and tiny fishes and feathery underwater plant life , all awaiting discovery .

A ride in a four- or six-passenger helicopter will bring you here in about 40 minutes. // Don ' t think of it as 40 wasted minutes , though . One of the best ways to see the Great Barrier Reef is to fly over it , for the water washing the coral here is constantly moving , making a kaleidoscope pattern , rushing away , then rushing back to make another one. // The wave action has a sandpaper effect on the reef , breaking off pieces of coral and pounding them into sand . On second thought , perhaps you don ' t have to thank the parrotfish for the beach you find here .
