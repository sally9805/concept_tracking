The commission has galvanized interest in immigration , but it is not clear what the Reagan Administration ' s reaction to the report will be . Moreover , no consensus has been forged in Congress to support its key proposals : penalities against employers who hire illegal aliens , an amnesty for most illegal aliens already in the United States , a modest increase in legal immigration and stricter enforcement measures , especially along the Mexican border. // The focus of attention shifts now from the commission to Congress . Representative Romano L. Mazzoli , a Kentucky Democrat who serves as chairman of the House Judiciary subcommittee on immigration , said the report , issued yesterday , was " the opening salvo of a very serious re-examination of this nation ' s immigration and refugee policies. " // // Served on Commission // Mr. Mazzoli ' s counterpart in the Senate , Alan K. Simpson , Republican of Wyoming , and the ranking Republican on Mr. Mazzoli ' s subcommittee , Hamilton Fish Jr. of upstate New York , served on the 16-member commission headed by the Rev. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dame . So they are prepared for the task of rewriting the nation ' s immigration laws , which are unmatched in complexity by any Federal statutes except perhaps the tax code. // " There is a very strong disposition in the House among my colleagues for passage of some kind of measure , " Mr. Mazzoli said . " This gives us an outline , a matrix in which we can then find the politically feasible elements. " // The House majority leader , Jim Wright of Texas , and Strom Thurmond , the South Carolina Republican who is president pro tem of the Senate and chairman of the Judiciary Committee , both said that dealing with immigration policy should have a high priority , but the momentum built up by such comments is fragile at best . In the absence of some public response by the Reagan Administration , the commission and its work could disappear into a vacuum . <> <> Cabinet Members to Confer // President Reagan created a Cabinet-level committee today to review the Hesburgh commission proposals . It consists of the Attorney General , William @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Secretaries of State , Labor , and Health and Human Services. // Edwin J. Gray , director of the White House Office of Policy Development , said he was familiar with the main points of the Hesburgh commission report , but he declined to discuss its merits . " This was not a report put together by any of President Reagan ' s appointees , " he said in a brief interview . " It ' s a result of efforts by others . We will take it under advisement. " // Several themes of the report appear to run counter to broad policies already formulated by the Reagan Administration . A statute establishing penalties for employers who hired illegal aliens would increase Federal regulation of the workplace at a time when Mr. Reagan says he has a mandate to reduce Government regulation. // The executive director of the commission , Dr. Lawrence H. Fuchs , said that its proposals for improved enforcement along the Mexican border would cost $43 million . He acknowledged that such an expenditure was " totally out of sync " with the cost-cutting austerity advocated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Long-Term Costs Cited // Commission members said , however , that if such " relatively small " expenditures were not made to curtail illegal immigration , the long-term social and economic costs could be great. // In its thinking on immigration , the Reagan Administration is less subject to the influence of organized labor and more interested in the revival of a guest-worker program than was the Carter Administration . Reagan Administration officials are also acutely sensitive to the needs of the South and West , where most illegal immigrants from Latin America have settled. // The League of United Latin American Citizens , which describes itself as the country ' s largest Hispanic organization , said that the commission had offered " politically expedient solutions " overemphasizing enforcement. // " Immigration is a cultural phenomenon with worldwide patterns and implications , " said Ruben Bonilla Jr. , president of the league . " It ' s much too complex to be resolved by the simple Band-Aid approaches reflected in many sections of the commission ' s report . " <> <> Attention to Causes Urged // Likewise , the Mexican @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States , instead of stressing enforcement at the border , should pay more attention to the economic causes of immigration from Mexico. // In an effort to encourage public debate on immigration , representatives of 18 organizations announced today that they were starting a " national forum " in which to conduct research and share opinions . The list of members , reflecting the diversity of interests concerned about immigration , includes the American Jewish Committee , the American Civil Liberties Union , the Lawyers ' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law , Zero Population Growth , the United States Conference of Mayors and the National Association of Counties. // Dale Frederick Swartz of the Lawyers ' Committee said : " Many of us have strong objections to the commission ' s recommendations and analysis , but we are , in effect , holding our fire . We want to study it very carefully , and where we disagree , we want to offer well reasoned alternatives. " // Some of the commission ' s other proposals , overshadowed by its principal recommendations , may prove just as important in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Federal program of " impact aid " for local governments that resettle refugees ; punitive fines for schools that fail to keep track of their foreign students , and creation of a special court to handle all deportation cases. // The commission also said that there should be somewhat greater supervision of State Department consular officers , who now have almost absolute authority in deciding whether to grant visa applications. //
