The Presidency <P> <P> Each year George Washington gains more luster in our reveries on how we got where we are . Our sophisticated scholarship and painstaking restoration , which so often dismantle heroes , have revealed the human dimensions of the father of the country but have failed to dim the aura of greatness that clings to Washington , whose 251st birthday we mark next week . <P> His contemporaries felt the same awe and wonder . In Washington 's last years , Mount Vernon became a mecca for the great and the grateful , for the curious and the ambitious . So many people arrived at the doorstep that Washington , who would turn none away , finally engaged a social secretary to handle the flow . Sometimes he did not attend the dinners he gave because the company was so numerous and foreign to him . One night when he dined alone with Mrs. Washington , the event was so unusual he made a note of it in his diary . <P> The legend of the man is safely sheltered these days behind high fences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that might not be the case , and therein may lie a lesson . We have in this nation erected standards for our public people that dim anyone 's glow if he or she falls short of perfection . It is reasonable , then , to wonder if people can enter public life and make a difference as they did in the first years of the Republic . Even as our expectations have grown , our respect for and sympathy with Presidents have diminished . <P> By our modern measures , George Washington did not read the right books . He relished how-to-do-it texts , with their new ideas on the use of manure , turning soil and animal husbandry . But he did not delve very far into art , philosophy or science . When John Kennedy was coaxed into supplying a list of his ten favorite books , the collection was heavy with history , biography and geopolitics , the kind of reading that he knew critical journalists would admire . Twenty years ago , we took Presidents at their word . The suspicion now is that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreign languages ( Thomas Jefferson spoke or read five ) . Washington never traveled to Europe , while Benjamin Franklin , John Adams and Jefferson all spent years there . He was not an accomplished public speaker . His military achievements were judged for their perseverance rather than their brilliance . Yet the battle of Trenton might have been as important a battle as this nation ever won . The Trenton victory brought the Revolution back to life . The colonies dared hope again for independence . France began to look with more favor on the American struggle , and Britain began to lose heart . But the battle was technically a shambles . <P> Three columns were to have crossed the Delaware River . Only Washington made it across . The powder of his troops was soaked by a freezing rain , so they could not fire their arms . They had to depend on bayonets several times during the night . Washington 's officers pleaded with him to call off the attack . The story goes that he stood on an old beehive in a muddy New Jersey field @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was won by the determination of one man , but certainly not by his military expertise . Would he have done what he did on that miserable night if the failing campaign had been on the evening news with closeup shots of the ragged men ?
