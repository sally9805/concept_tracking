Soon others besides Russell were after Wittgenstein , starting with Lytton Strachey. s.8.IV.13W. to tea today with Lytton Strachey &; Maynard Keynes . W. very offhand , as if this were nothing . I met Keynes and Strachey December last , in M.'sp181office . Both were so formidable . In their eagerness to talk to M. , they quite passed over me . Could n't very well blame them . M. pushed several questions my way , but I was blocked  --  they were so dashing &; sure . Also , Strachey made me nervous , he leaned so close ; also his laugh  --  extravagant , forced , a bit overbearing . Keynes dark &; glowering &; aloof  --  arrogant , I hear , &; justly so if this be true . M. says he 's fully as clever as Russell . ( Naturally , M. would eliminate himself from the running . ) Later , W. returns from this tea . Says they wish him to come to a meeting of the Apostles , where he is to talk on a subject of his choosing , wch. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ W. would go , tho ' he treats this as nothing  --  a courtesy , nothing more . He deludes himself : it is hardly a courtesyto accept an invitation to meet with the brilliants of Cambridge 's mysterious &; elect club . But here I see I am jealous , &; then am ashamed to be jealous . Still , I am not so shamed as Wittgenstein is of his own ambition . This W. conceals even from himself , like his wealth . Nonetheless , he is wealthy . And ambitious . When Wittgenstein told Russell about this invitation two days later , he took this same offhand attitude . But like Pinsent , Russell saw through it . It rankled Russell to hear of it two days after the fact , but what bothered him even more was that the Apostles had not consulted him before extendingthe invitation . After all , thought Russell , what did Strachey and Keynes  --  or Moore , for that matter  --  know about Wittgenstein ? They saw only the energy and potential ; they knew nothing about his volatile nature . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Society , which had become less a culture of Moore and more one of Strachey , who had brought the homoerotic wing of the Society out of its early period of latency into the more aggressive politics of the Higher Sodomy . This , for Strachey , was the intellectual sublimity and indeed supremacyof male love  --  of Patroclus with his arm around the immortal Achilles  --  and of the glory of the ancient Greek theater , where men , in a dream of androgyny , rendered womankind superfluous , playing the parts of both men and women . This , then , had hastened Russell 's departure . As for Moore , who for years had thought sodomy had died with the ancients , he cast something of a half-blind eye on this . But then of course when the Divine Moore was present among the randys , there weren'tthe droll looks and pats , the brittle jokes and esoterica about tight bums and buggery . Even as Wittgenstein sat there with his legs twisted around , Russell could feel his tension building . Wittgenstein was asking him , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Society  --  if it was not vain and foolish.  |p182Russell  was brusque . Well , go , he said . Go , by all means . At least see if you like it . Wittgenstein 's eyes wandered , then he asked suddenly , You were a member , were you not ? Russell shrugged . Oh , some years ago . It 's been four or five years since I turned in my wings  --  angels , we 're called , the older fellows who have taken degrees and gone on . Strachey and Keynes are angels  --  fallen angels , he added with a snort , wondering if Wittgenstein would catch his drift , or if indeed this might be Wittgenstein 's drift . Probing , Russell added vaguely , Moore 's still active , I believe . Yes . Wittgenstein looked up suddenly . Moore named me . Oh ? Russell turned to light his pipe , the match flaring as he poked it into the bowl . Wittgenstein saw Russell 's sly look but misread it , wondering if Russell was really the one behind it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indeed , no . Russell grimaced with the pipe fixed between his teeth . I had nothing to do with it . Strachey 's the one who runs the show now . Moore 's a mere figurehead . They said nothing to me . But now Wittgenstein got a different feeling , a hint of censure that bled into a hue he was at peril to discriminate . Rising again , Wittgenstein asked edgily , Well , what do you think ? Ought I to join ? If I am asked , I mean ? Well  --  Russell began to speak , then checked himself , saying with dubiousconviction , Go . Wittgenstein turned , circled , turned , sat . His indecision dance . I mean that , repeated Russell . Go  --  But why ? Do you care ? Care ? Why , of course not . Again , a moment 's hesitation , then a cloud of smoke as Russell added , On the other hand , I do n't want anyone to think I told you not to go . But why would anyone think that ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ice . Why ever would you advise me against it ? Cautiously offhand , Russell said , Because I 'm no longer active . I do n't know . They 're a suspicious lot in ways . Suspicious ? In the way of a coterie , suspicious . Nothing very unusual in a group , the cliquishness and little intrigues . And Moore ? What about Moore ? He takes part in this ?  |p183Dear  me , I do n't know . A dry smile . Moore is Moore . But then Wittgenstein felt a different edge to this , causing him to ask , Then you 've quarreled , you two ? No , we have n't quarreled . An indignant look . Another cloud of smoke . Go  --  You 'll see soon enough what you like . See what ? Go ! Wittgenstein was n't the only one who felt Russell 's spurs . By the heavy swing doors , on his way to Hall for breakfast the next morning , Russell finally caught up with Moore . Russell strode straight up to him . I understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moore eyed him up and down . That 's correct . You initiated it ? Come to quarrel with me this morning , have you ? Not to quarrel , to inquire . Well , your manner is fast making me angry . I 'd like to know why I was n't informed . You 're no longer active . Why was I obliged to inform you ? As a courtesy if nothing else . I 'm a member in good standing . Former member . And a former member who , I fear , is a bit off coursethis morning . Am I ? asked Russell , leaning closer so this would n't be heard . I venture you 'd feel the same if it were Pinsent . Pinsent goes his own way , said Moore measuredly . Thanks to Wittgenstein , he 's gone it quite completely , actually . Russell stood there nodding . And this is my fault , is it ? That your game , is it ? To use the Apostles to pry Wittgenstein away from Pinsent ? This was so absurd that Moore hardly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I believe that will be quite enough this morning , thank you . Yes , by all means . Russell dropped his shoulders . By all means . That was all . Separately , they strode down the corridor into Hall , where the hazy sun was streaming through the stained glass , warming the ancient oak of the trenchers , where breakfast was already under way . And there , at opposite ends of High Table , not a pistol shot away , the two dons chopped and swallowed in silence , their stomachs gurgling with early morning acid.  |p184Getting  nowhere with Moore , Russell then did the next worse thing : like Paul Revere , he went to Strachey and Keynes to warn them of the danger of electing Wittgenstein . Normally , Russell was effective in the counselor 's role , but this time he was in a sorry state . Lytton , always able to see the worst , thought Russell was in a shambles  --  old as Methuselah , with his haggard grimace and hair singed white . Such a crashing bore Bertie was , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was practically panting as he ran on with mountingfrustration . You simply do n't know Wittgenstein as I do . I 'm convinced he 'll find the Society an utter waste of time . And really , he added impoliticly , you both must admit the Society is not what it once was . I would n't say that , interjected Keynes , who for five minutes had listenedin silence to this diatribe . Keynes felt the edge of this just as keenly as Strachey did , and he was not one to be toyed with . Keynes 's tapping foot was like the switching tail of a cogitating cat as he continued . To every angel I 'm sure the next generation seems debased  --  less this or that . But I can assure you the Brethren are quite impressive . Especially this latest crop . Very well , then , said Russell , straining to be conciliatory . I stand corrected . But I still tell you  --  Wittgenstein may go along for a meeting or two , but then he will leave . Of that I 'm certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If you do n't mind my asking , Bertie , of what consequence is it to you ? Me ? Why , it 's nothing to me . Russell felt himself inwardly wince at this transparent denial . It 's Wittgenstein I 'm concerned about . There 's quite enough turmoil in him . Keynes 's foot set once more to tapping , and Strachey , taking his cue , asked still more pointedly , Just turmoil in Wittgenstein , is it ? Russell was moved to anger , but looking into Strachey 's raw , bearded face he thought better of it , seeing to his humiliation that he was defenseless . He had no good answer ; even for himself , he had no good answer , let alone one that these two partisans would have accepted . Retreating toward the door , Russell could only repeat his warnings . As a statistician , Keynes had a first-rate logical mind  --  frequently he and Russell conferred on matters of mutual interest . Hanging by the door then , Russell was hoping that Keynes , with his courtier 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change the subject , perhaps even invite him to tea . Instead , the unstintingly correct Keynes ushered him out with that mild solicitousness reserved for dotards and cripples , saying , Well , good day , old man , good day .. .  |p185And  as the door swung closed , Russell had a distinct sense of social slippage , feeling  --  quite correctly , it turned out  --  that he would soon be the butt of half of Cambridge , with Ottoline pulling the strings like Pallas Athene . But Russell did n't stop there . Starved for information , he boldly went up to Pinsent one day and introduced himself . Pinsent wrote : 4-v-13At last I meet Russell . Russell , rather , meets me  --  waylays me . " You 're D.P. , are n't you ?  --  Wittgenstein 's friend ? " Feel cool to him . R. says how much he has wanted to meet me . W. has told him so much . " Has he ? " I ask . " Oh , indeed , " R. assures me . I look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not forthcoming . For someone who has heard so much , he is certainly full of questions . Suddenly he asks , " Well , what do you think about this business with the Apostles ? Do you think W. will join ? But "  --  he shrugs  --  " M. recommended him , after all . I suppose it might be a good thing . " Did R. know what he was saying ? He certainly did ; the fox was craftily watching to see my reaction . I must have looked upset . Feel even M. has duped me . Here M. purports to think so highly of my talent , yet he recommendsW. &; not me ! Pinsent tried to conceal his anger from Moore , but Moore felt the chill . At the same time , Moore saw Pinsent 's work was suffering . A few days later , Pinsent wrote : 9 . V.I3M. takes me aside today . From the start I know it 's about his concerns that I 'm neglecting my studies as a result of W.M. is more donnish than usual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with every well-intentioned parson or prefect who ever sat me down . I want to ask , " Why even speak to me ? If mine is such a weighty talent , why did n't you recommend me ? " M. is so careful in his enquiry . Remarks that I 've been preoccupied . Implies that I 've given up too much of myself for W. 's sake . Nothing new here . I 've merely thrown Mother over for a new patient . Not long after this , Pinsent felt pressure from yet another quarter. 13 . V.13Reply from Mother to my last letter . Concerned about my hints at droppingmathematics for classics , possible problems with stipends . More ex/penses &; no money , yet here W. has invited me to Vienna this summer . Feel guilty at the thought of eating lavishly there , while Mother hardly eats at all . W. tells me I 'm too harsh on her . Am I ? Am tempted to show him her letters but feel he 'd probably find them charming , as w/ his beloved cowboys . Mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grocer , having put in a new garden to replace the overgrown ruin that she planted last summer , w/ its mushy tomatoes . Another litter of cats to overrun the place &; the roof still leaking . Says she paid 3 pounds to have it fixed , but the man got drunk &; put his foot through the thatch &; did not return . Now torrents pour down , but Mother says we have the most glorious swifts in the attic . She predicts that the tufts on the dandelions auger a halcyon summer ; &; such clouds , &; such faces on them ! And when , she asks , shall I bring home this Mr. Wittgenstein ? W. says he would very much like to go . He will pay all expenses , of course . And then we shall leave , &; naturally I shall feel not a whit guilty about Mother eating mushy tomatoes among the swifts &; clouds &; cats , w/ the rain dribbling down in pots .. . And so the trip was arranged : in the third weekend of May , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country outside Birmingham . In the meantime , other forces were in motion . Two days before they were to leave , Wittgenstein finally went before the Apostles and gave his speech on " The Nature of Logic . " Abstract , exalted , fierce , Wittgenstein kept the Brethren enthralled for ten minutes before he summarily sat down . His election the next day was virtually unanimous . As it turned out , Russell was quite correct in his warnings about Wittgensteinand the Society . Moore was visibly displeased when Wittgenstein came to him that day to explain his hesitation about joining , his fears that it was not right for him and that he would eventually disappoint the brothers  --  roughly what Russell had been saying all along . But there was also what Wittgenstein did not say about a certain undercurrent he felt in these ostensibly Olympian discussions . For Wittgenstein , these men were too much at ease , expending too much energy exploring vaguely frivolous topics . He could n't stand the solemn pauses , the deliciousreaching and je ne sais quoi punctuated with tweaking innuendoes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he to let them , they would have adored him , and this also was his fear , that he might succumb to this decorous ease . To remain honest , he felt he must be even harder , more fierce and impervious : he was the potential criminal who must make himself a judge . Still , the atmosphere was dangerously attractive , strumming the stringsp187of a side of him that he had to fight , if not expunge . There was the poet Bekassy , a British-educated Hungarian aristocrat more English than the English , dandified and severe , with slick dark hair and malodorous opinionshe let out like fragrance from a perfume flask . In Bekassy was a fulsome whiff of home , the sirocco of Hungarian politics and the Prater , of the booted equestrian who sojourned into the meadows at sunset , havingbrought his strap and left his horse elsewhere . As for the others , Wittgensteinliked Keynes quite well  --  Keynes struck him as a clear thinker . But Strachey ! To hear him address one of his pets in an urgent whisper as Pussums @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But as he was repelled , so was he faintly drawn . Of course , Wittgenstein did not say this to Moore , who found his evidentagitation difficult to comprehend , if not a bit suspect . Yes , Moore was vexed with him , vexed at these vague complaints expressed as scruples , not to mention the implicit insult that what was good enough for Moore was somehow not good enough for Wittgenstein . Moore wondered what he ought to do . Like Pilate , he had largely tried to remove himself from the proceedings . He had purposely stayed away from the previous night 's meeting  --  a strategic move to sidestep Russell 's probable criticism that he was meddling . But now , having tried to do the decent thing , Moore felt duped . Russell would have the last laugh : Moore could well imagine Russell 's delight  --  if not his hand in this  --  but that was another matter . Moore 's immediate concern was that if Wittgenstein waited too long to accept this honor , he would be burning his bridges . The Brethren would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he thought better of his decision . Wittgenstein 's talk with Moore went poorly , and he did not expect his visit to Russell to go much better . But more than just the Apostles was weighing on Wittgenstein then : there was also Russell 's theory of types . In his work developing a proper logical symbolism , Wittgenstein had recently become convinced that Russell 's theory was not so much wrong as unnecessary . Wittgenstein had not consciously ferreted this out . Rather , the realization seemed to have found him , like a collision . Wittgenstein still felt sick about it . He knew it was his duty to tell Russell , but he was dreading it . Still , he felt it could wait . Certainly , he had no intention of broaching the subject that day as he went to tell Russell about his election . This proved an unnecessary courtesy , Moore having sent Russell a curt note about the election that morning . Russell could well imagine Moore 's triumph , not to mention that of the gossips like Strachey , who would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stealing  --  the fruits of another 's genius . Prompted by Lytton , even Ottoline had entered the fray , asking Russell , much to his mortification , why he had to embarrass himself , and her , with his meddling . The moment Wittgenstein set foot inside Russell 's rooms , he sensed his mentor 's smoldering resentment , and it rankled him . At the same time , Wittgenstein felt that his predicament was far from Russell 's fault . Rather , it stemmed from the ratiocinations of a higher logic , of which his logic and life were somehow the unhappy result . And again with his electionto the Society  --  with that sudden , ineluctable sense of elevation and the threat of pleasure  --  Wittgenstein felt a compensatory desire to veer away from that pole and end his life . But even this desire was not enough . To carry it out , Wittgenstein felt , in a blind way , that he must do somethingdeserving of death , and that afternoon at Russell 's he found it just as surely as if he 'd planned his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shunted aside , and they were suddenly talking ( if indeed they had ever stopped talking ) about logic , of its sublimeblankness . The old logic , said Wittgenstein ( meaning , Russell 's logic ) did not grasp this fundamental truth . The old logic assumed a hierarchy of propositions , building up from axioms , when in fact all the propositionsof logic stand on the same level and say the same thing  --  namely , nothing . This , Wittgenstein told Russell , was his great mistake . For the old logic , logic was fundamentally a cog machine : it supplied certain primitive propositions , it supplied the rules of deduction governing their use , and it then said that what results is a logical proposition  --  one that had been pushed through the sausage grinder and thus made logical . In his urgency then , Wittgenstein was hardly building an airtight argument . He was not piercing or succinct . On the contrary , he was thoroughlyscattered and staccato . But this only made the force of his invectivemore fearsome and bewildering . And then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attacking the theory of types , Russell 's response to the Cretan who called all Cretans liars . Wittgenstein was the confoundingCretan . The essence of Russell 's theory , Wittgenstein was saying , was that a proposition could not make a statement about itself . But this , he declared , was only a chimera imposed by Russell 's mathematics , for which it was necessary that numbers be classes of classes . In mathematics , this might be expedient , Wittgenstein said , but in logic it held no sway and was in fact useless . Our work in the field of logic might help us better display logic , he said , but it could not supply or create logic : how could we presume to supply what is already there ? In logic we dop189not express whatever we wish with the aid of signs ; rather , the nature of the absolutely necessary signs speaks for itself . In his theory , then , Russell was only imposing a form on what was already logical and perfect . Clearly , Wittgenstein said , the laws of logic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ logic  --  it was here , he insisted , that Russell 's theory broke down . It tried to talk about the types it had imposed when one could only talk about the particular symbols . After all , Wittgenstein said , to declare the meanings of signs when establishing rules for them  --  well , this was certainly wrong . In a correct symbolism there would be no need to invent a system of types to avoid contradictions ; the correct sense would be evident in the signs themselves  --  evident in advance , so to speak . Wittgenstein , by then , was not in control of his voice or his hands ; his eyes were gritty slits . There was no question in Russell 's mind that Wittgensteinwas right : to Russell , Wittgenstein was infallible  --  sibylline . Without defense or will , Russell sat listlessly in a chair near the lamp . Funny how his hands looked to him under the light , like gloves , so useless and old . Slowly , the blood was draining from his upturned fingers ; his breath came in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week , would Russelleven begin to assess the extent of the damage , much less the further damage that would result , forcing a slow but inexorable change in his life . The wound , Russell assured himself , was not mortal . Russell told himself that his work was like a ship sectioned into watertight compartments , with other doors  --  sound theories  --  that could contain the flood when a bulkhead had ruptured . His ship was not sinking , he assured himself . This setback was only temporary . Ottoline had been speaking of an Italian holiday that summer . Yes , they would journey south to Italy , that 's where . Ah , he could see them in Venice , so sensual and golden , then on to Naples , the warm Mediterranean . Standing on some sundrenchedterrace with Ottoline , tanned and relaxed , he would be a man transformed . Utterly dashing and charming in his linen suit , he would wend his way through one long party , feeling the admiration of all the ladies as he said , E una notte serena @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . Il piacere , it piacere . . . But while the hemorrhaging Russell retreated into dreams , Wittgensteincould not stay , not after this . In his own eyes , he was no better than Judas , and Russell was too distracted to stop him from leaving . But then as the door closed , it occurred to Russell that Wittgenstein might really kill himself , and he thought , Good , then gave a shudder , as if he had kitten his tongue . 1'insent was asleep when Russell knocked an hour later.  | ... Russell appears at r A.M. in a state . He says W. is " upset " &; he is looking for him . Am tempted to ask why W. is upset but I do not , &; R. does not volunteer . I ask R. if he has checked W. 's room and he says yes . " You just knocked ? " I ask , thinking W. might be inside , hanged . R. knows my fear &; adds uncomfortably , " I checked inside . After knocking , of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delicate &; queasy ; I have the gory feeling of going through some deceased relative 's personal effects . We do n't want to sound the alarm  --  do n't want to embarrass W. if it is nothing . We are only " looking , " &; from time to time R. , faced with my silence , makes ridiculous excuses : " If only he could rest ... If only he took better care of himself . " For two hours we look , then give it up , promising to notify each other if he turns up . R. says officiously , " I really must speak to him tomorrow . " Evidently , R. wants me to agree that this will make everything much better . But all I can bring myself to say is good night . R. is a sad , ruined figure at 3 A.M. ; in him there is love , I think , but I can not warm to him . Still , can not entirely blame him . If so strong a man as R. is not immune to W. , how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubtful that W. can even endure himself , &; I think of him hanging from a pipe , like one with a price on his head . FloWITTGENSTEIN DID TURN UP the next day  --  no better , no worse , so far as Pinsent could tell . Keeping his promise to Russell , Pinsent said nothing about that night , and Wittgenstein said nothing either . Even the following morning as they boarded the westbound train for Birmingham , Wittgenstein said nothing about Russell or the Apostles . Pinsent wrote : I do not count it a good sign that he does not confide in me &; sense I am not to ask . Instead , we talk about Mother &; what we shall do at home , while I worry if she will have anything prepared . Looking out the window of the train , W. remarks , as if he has just now noticed , " We are on a holiday . " In all , it was a pleasant journey , warm May weather . Yet there was still the same discomfort with money , which remained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  second class , quite unostenta/tious  --  sliding quiet notes across the cage , then pocketing his change with lowered eyes and a furtive hike of the trousers , as though he were turning from a urinal . Lunch was another hurdle . In the swaying dining car , huddled behind his wobbling water goblet , Pinsent froze as Wittgensteininvited him to order . In that millrace of the spirit , seeking ever purer air , Wittgenstein was increasingly ascetic in his tastes . He preferred the simple and bland - a near vegetarian  --  but this did not prevent him from suggesting that Pinsent should try the mixed grill or perhaps the York ham and Winchester pudding . Peering up , his red hair fanning across his face , Pinsent asked ascerbically , Why ? So you can watch ? Pinsent kept him honest and of this earth  --  or tried . And actually , Wittgenstein was in somewhat better spirits as they ate their lunch , both staring out at the rolling hills of the midlands . It gave Wittgenstein pleasure to indulge his friend , heir to the life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grill with a bowl of mock turtle soup . Knowing how Pinsent loved sweets , Wittgenstein , on the sly , told the steward to bring his friend a raspberry trifle . Pinsent was man alive . He would not refuse these earthly gifts ; it was the draconian Wittgenstein who ate humblepie , as quick to deny these innocent pleasures as he was to reject the Apostles , where the food was surely too ambrosial . Wittgenstein would remain friendly with the piercing Keynes , but he could not stomach these other young men , so vain of their brilliance , certain of their place and free with their opinions , and much else . No , now that Wittgenstein had been offered an Apostleship , he was quite sure that Pinsent would not want one  --  assuming , of course , that one was even offered . ( Pinsent , it seemed to Wittgenstein , was not the trumped-up , obviously impressive sort of man who got noticed for such things ; nor was he titled , handsome or rich . ) No , in his ill-guided but well-meaning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it seemed to him , did not want philosophy  --  Wittgenstein certainly did not want his friend mucking those stalls . He did not question his own motives ; he had no sense of being selfish , or patronizing or presumptuous . If nothing else , he could at least bequeath Pinsent a life free of pain , failure and want . And soon enough Wittgensteinwould remove from Pinsent 's path the impediment his own life represented . He would not be a Blocker , nor would he be greedy : if he could not eat , procreate or prosper on this earth , then he would shortly cede his place to one who could . And so Wittgenstein was going to meet David'smother , to see that all was properly provided for.  |p192As  they neared Birmingham , meanwhile , Pinsent was worried how Flo would come off to his friend . Pinsent 's irreverence about his mother pained Wittgenstein , but then Pinsent was hardly fooled by the court portrait that Wittgenstein painted of his own family . Even more exasperatingfor Pinsent was how Wittgenstein would paint Flo as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , unjust son . Pinsent said he knew the truth . He told Wittgenstein that he could damned well call her Flo or Bats if he chose  --  it was he , after all , who had pressed a lock of her hair inside the glass of her photograph . And really , Pinsent told Wittgenstein , if life at home was so awfully cozy , where were the photos of his mother and father ? Pinsent was silent and nervous as their motorcab climbed Dalk 's Hill , where Flo lived in a cottage of rust-colored stone . It was open farm country , not far from a village set among bowed fields and pastures bound by hedgerows . In the distance there was a slice of river , milk white in the sun , and below that a long swell of slope , mild and green , with cows and a squat stand of trees . Flo was nowhere to be seen . The gate was gone , and the stones of the walk were slick with brownish-green moss . Last year 's rotting apples lay beneath the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approached the door , scrawny cats bounded like rabbits through the weeds . Mind your step , said Pinsent with embarrassment as they picked over broken crockery and a rusty garden trowel where someone had tried to pot something . Pinsent sighed as the door fell open . She never locks it , he said . Inside , under moss-dark beams , was a murky clutter , a mindscape of half-finished puzzles , hands of solitaire , novels splayed on their spines . Still , it was a feminine disarray , not entirely unattractive . Like giant fungi , blackened oranges spiked with cloves hung from the beams , addinga vinous , spicy scent to the general subterranean odor . And then they heard Flo 's conjugating cry : Dave , Davy , David ! Floating under a mist of reddish-gray hair and dressed in an old gown of silk , lace and tulle , tiny Florence Pinsent barreled down the stairs , then hugged and kissed her son before she abruptly turned to shake Wittgenstein'shand . Oh ! she exclaimed when Wittgenstein made an abbreviated bow . David said you had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought me Sweet William ! Before Wittgenstein could even present them to her , she had thrust her blunt nose into the mottled mass of flowers . Oh ! Oh ! Waving her hands , Flo hardly knew whether to get her eyeglasses or a vase , she was so prickly excited.  |p193There  was no stopping her then . Did you see that rain ? Florence Pinsentsuddenly wanted to know , gaping up at Wittgenstein as if she had just now seen the Annunciation . Now that was the rain , it was . It passed right over ! I prayed it would miss you ! I said so and meant it , and it did and did n't , dear me ! Flo 's mouth widened as if she had just remembered that her son was indeed here . David , my love , let me look at you ! He 's so shy , she said , turning secretively to Wittgenstein , her accomplice in this orgy of affection . And Sweet William you brought me ! Not baby 's breath , she cautionedsuddenly , though no one had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remarked , Is n't that a queer name , baby 's breath ? Do you suppose anyone knew what baby 's breath looked like when they named it ? I 'd call it sneeze plant  --  oh , it makes me sneeze just to look at it ! But you know , she said , wagging her finger , perhaps the person that named it baby 's breath saw a baby 's breath in the winter  --  when it was steaming , I mean . Clasping her downturned bosom , Florence Pinsent grandly sneezed . David , darling , resumed Flo , making a pouty face as hungry cats wove underfoot . The fire must have just gone out ! Just gone out , Mother ? asked the son , looking at the cold coals . Then , rolling her eyes , she said mischievously , I do n't know what happened , dear . Now he 's angry at me , you see , she said , taking refuge behindWittgenstein . But Davy , she continued in a whiny , girlish voice . Just an hour ago I stirred it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make tea with your lovely Mr. Wittgenstein . She was a consummate actress , adept at creating little cul de sacs and enveloping silences between people . Taking her guest by the arm , she led him toward the unkempt kitchen , saying , I 'm so excited that David has finally brought a friend home , Mr. Wittgenstein . David 's so very excited about your work . He says it 's far more important than his . I think therefore I am ! Oh , no , David did n't say that  --  dear me , did you think so ? My , no . Descartes Rene said so . I once tried to read him but I never got very far . I was never am enough to think I was , so I was n't  --  so here I am ! Or was  --  Mrs. Pinsent flounced to the window to tap at a cat by the pane , then pointed out a cloud that she said looked like the king , gross and fat in his Ascot top hat . Had he ever seen the king , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Georgie  --  she meant the fat , dead one . Edward was his name . She had , once . Seen him , that is . Queen Flo then decreed they would have tea and Wittgenstein was sent scrounging beneath the cabinets for the kettle , which they set on the gasp194ring after yet another search for matches . I have the most wonderful biscuits , she said . Mistress of this tea party , Flo giggled with her mouth full and a wondering crinkling of the eyes . They 're hazelnut somethings , I think  --  or filbert . I did n't make them , you know , she said just as proudly as if she had . Shoo ! she said , driving a cat from the table . And again she went to the window , amazed to see the dolloped clouds massing over the western hills . And you must promise , she resumed , looking a little cross , you must remind me to show you David 's numerous awards . Have you any ? David has . Oh , but he 'll be terribly upset @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one ear , you know . Oh , yes . A man pulled his ear when he was a boy . Then argumentatively , I saw him ! His uncle it was .. . So began the pattern in which Flo would breathlessly take her guest aside to tell a seemingly pointless story which had the quality of whistling out of tune . Nevertheless , there was a fractured melody to these stories ; the mother , however queer and charming , was more cunning and manipulativethan she let on . Dimly , through the cloaking sweetness , Flo feared her guest . As the next day began to unfold , Wittgenstein even began to suspect that she was angry at him for usurping her boy . Wittgenstein could hardly blame her  --  if anything , he shared her fears , feeling that with time he would only bring Pinsent to grief as he had Russell . Wittgenstein 's guilt over Russell was weighing on him heavily now . Shortly before leaving for Birmingham , Wittgenstein had seen his mentor . Embroidering on the subject of his theory of types , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shock , Russell had really been asking Wittgenstein to assure him that his theory was salvageable , that , with time , all would be put to right . Wittgenstein could n't do it . All he could offer Russell was silence  --  and not out of spite or anger . There was simply nothing to say : Russell 's theory was wrong . But if Wittgenstein did not grasp Flo 's point initially , he did the second day when she asked , Do you know Mr. Moore ? Well , he 's very fond of David , I gather , but he wrote me saying he was concerned about David 's , um , direction . Well , of course , I did n't know what to make of it , Mr. Wittgenstein . But then I got another letter from his governor , saying Davidhad been neglectful of his studies . They have such high expectations of him . You see , he has a scholarship , and a very grand one , too . So odd how Flo went on , so artlessly , as if she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he were party to a conversation inside her head , or his . She was an artful paradox , was Flo . She knew , for all her apparent artlessness , how to turn the screw . Do you agree with Mr. Moore ? she asked after a long , fitful silence . In Flo 's own interiorp195logic , no reply was necessary or solicited from the visitor . Speaking into him as if into the telephone , Flo added with a hush of dread , I 'm sure you have David 's best interest at heart . I know he must help you  --  he said your work is more important . David 's always helped  --  it 's his natureto help . And expect none in return , mind you . Do you ? Mind ? My , no , help . Help Davy . Then before he could even answer came the reprise . David has certainly helped me . Oh , indeed , he has ! That 's David 's way , you know . Flo would say , It was the rainiest rain , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good  --  because he was her Davy David Descartes Rene , her am , so to speak , since all else was , or was no longer . Flo was herself a tautology . I am David 's mother , she would declare , as if her silent guest might otherwise miss the connection . It was the silliest thing , how ideas came to Wittgenstein , slowly rising like bubbles to the surface . For months now , Wittgenstein had been on the verge of perhaps his most fundamental insight , but not until Flo had it quite struck him in that direct , offkey way of a revelation , with that accompanying shortness of breath and the air suddenly a pale hue . What struck Wittgenstein with such force then was the notion that although a tautology says nothing , it shows its form and hence the undergirding structure of logic . On the tensile water , the wobbling rings were settling themselves ; on the strumming water , above the freestanding depths , hung an apparent transparency of form without content , of form waiting like life to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Was n't life a tautology , singing of itself to itself ? Was n't suicide a contradiction , canceling itself with itself ? With Flo , there was a certain parallel . Beneath the patter , she was really asking the visitor to desist and return her son , saying these words not so much for what they said as for what they might show or conjure , since words were magic . Over the hills swept the clouds , bruised and dark . Hovering like a bird in the wind , suspended in that silence before the remark , Flo gaped as the next cloud swept down . Dark the ground , dark the sun . Whoa , cried Flo , clutching her mortified son . That cloud looks like a Chinaman . And so it was resolved . Out walking the next day , Wittgenstein suddenly thrust a bank draft for ten thousand pounds into Pinsent 's hand , saying , And no talk , please , of debt or gratitude . Nothing you owe me . Not even friendship . Please , and not another word . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I do n't want this ! No !  |p196I  insist  --  Wittgenstein put his hand on Pinsent 's shoulder . You did not ask me for this , I know . It is not charity . You need this . I do not . Why ? Pinsent 's eyes were welling over . Why do n't you need it ? Pinsent wanted to answer his own question , but again he held back . Answer me ! Never having properly understood money , its power to stun , Wittgensteinwas shocked by this reaction . It was as if someone had told him that his potent signature was not backed by gold . Awkwardly , Wittgensteinsaid , I have more money . Too much money . This is not to boast  --  it is just a fact . Please , David . Take it . For the wealthy man , this was something of a revelation . Until then , Wittgenstein never would have dreamed it was as hard to rid oneself of money as to have it . Pinsent wrote : 2.3. to do with it &; how to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peace , I think , then ought n't I sell it ? For now , we forget it  --  try . With money I think I can finally forget money , concentrate instead on beauty &; spirit , as he does . Only I shall do so in new trousers , w/ , I think , a Panama hat &; some beautiful braces . I should like such a hat but then wonder if I dare ; if it would be too vain . Later , I am feeling gay . Wittgenstein is whistling . In the pasture , W. calls to some cows in German . Cows love German , he explains , even our English cattle . These are spotted , smooth-horned Guernseys , clopping down . We are enveloped . They are all over us , jealous ladies , butting &; nudging for scratches behind their ears to relieve them of the incessant flies . Later , we eat below a pale field of new grass . Then , toward dusk , somethingwondrous . Thunder approaching . By the river , the sedge is sweeping up &; down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the grass , &; suddenly W. is terribly excited . On the water mayflies are hatching . Like sparks from a burning log , they pour out from the depths  --  clouds of them , white-white &; warbling soundlessly over the water . Sitting on the bank , W. is as under a tent ; an insect snow is falling all over him &; he is gazing up , overcome . Over the water , the nymphs are a flat white nebula , &; then the rain comes beating down , the water sizzling . Exposed out here , we might be struck by lightning , but he , ordinarily so practical , does not care . He does n't heed me when I call , &; then I see what it is . The flies are falling into the water . By the thousands , they are faltering like a white seltzer . The water is inundated &; all are dead . Looking at me , W. says , " Is n't it beautiful ? For all to rise &; fall for the same beautiful necessity ? Would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &; fall in unison , serving only nature ? " I am appalled . I say , " I think it is jolly good for flies , but not for men . Top197have all the generations fall like that , in unison ? How can you possibly call that idea beautiful ? " Now he is looking at me , not angry , but wistful ; it seems I do not understand , tho ' I think I do . He says , " You can not ever be sad for that , not for necessity . " " Whose necessity ? " I ask . " This is only something in your mind ! A poet might think it a beautiful thought , but he would not serve it . Was it really so poetic for Shelley to sail out in the storm &; drown himself ? That was for Shelley ; that was not for Poetry . " I ca n't stand it . Want to tear up the cheque . He knows  --  he must  --  that I fear he will kill himself . It taxes &; angers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , how he manipulates me . Who does he serve  --  who do I ? These flies obey another rule . That he has genius I acknowledge , but genius does not have to succumb to itself . I refuse to believe it . Wedding and WendingTHREE WEEKS LATER , not long after the end of term , Moore was sitting with Dorothy at the head table at his wedding reception as all present , including Russell , Pinsent and Strachey , rose to toast the new couple . The room was full of mirth and the heat of seventy-five people drinking , waltzing , hobnobbing . In that surfeit of happiness , tongues unfurled . Lytton Strachey , picking up after Moore 's older brother Harry , said a few more words on behalf of the newlyweds . Lytton 's toast was perfect  --  eloquent , touching , amusing . Until then , Russell had not planned to speak , but in the elation of the moment , he , too , stepped forth with raised glass and cleared his throat . What on earth am I doing ? he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on him . What will I say ? he wondered , hoping that this sudden impulse was more than just the rumbling of the grape . He and Moore were still on strained terms , but Russell felt that after today they might turn a new page . A few warm words , that was all he wanted to say . After all , he could hardly hope to top a wit like Strachey  --  or could he ? He did n't start badly . There was even a certain piquance as he , an avowed unbeliever , said what a blessing it was to behold an honest man with a good woman on their wedding day . Yes , he continued , warmingp198to his tongue 's toothsome twang . These two , he said , unleashing his arm , would stand as an example to them all of the outer extent of human hopes . But then with this bibulous reaching , he felt the compensating pull of humor  --  something to balance and subdue the emotion , like cutting wine with seltzer . Yes , for a generation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he added dryly , he did not do badly . Mrs. Moore would make a man  --  he stumbled  --  a better man of him . Here , here ! Moore , meanwhile , felt his bride urgently squeeze his hand , a telegraphicsqueeze emitting potent signals of irritation verging on outrage . Even Russell was kicking himself . Damn ! The way he tripped at the end , this as his eyes hungrily scanned the room for reaction . Oh , God . There was puckish Lytton , busily whispering to Keynes , Leonard Woolf and the attenuated Virginia . For his part , Moore would gladly have forgotten this gaffe had not Dorothy , her dark hair crowned with a diadem of white cyclamen trailing white ribbons , then hissed into his ear , What on earth did Bertie mean ? He 's so perverse . Two hours tied and she was already a wife , thought Moore , who as usual was surprised by how much she saw  --  and how much he missed . But in that swarm of perceptions , this thought , too , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own , still unable to get over the gold ring on his finger . When Moore looked again , Bertie was talking to Pinsent ; and then that image also vanished as his palsied Uncle Peter , a broken widower , came a third time to earnestly clutch their hands , fightingtears as he gasped for breath or words , wishing only to be near so much happiness . And here was Theodore Llewelyn Davies , an Apostle whom Moore had not seen in five  --  God , ten years at least ! And Crump ! Crump Davies , his brother ! Crumpie , look at you ! This is what heaven must be like , thought Moore , a tide where all of what was formerly , returns . God , but it was spooky to have so much come all at once , like those unaccountable presents covering the table , and all these people who eddied toward them like ghosts , grasping their hands in that grateful silence where words fail and fall away . In the face of such rampant joy , it was hard for Moore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and harder still to accept the fact that this joy would someday end . Their joy would be segmented , interspersed with the unhappinessor woes of which they had partaken with that brimming cup of vows . As through a telescope turned wrong end , Moore felt he could see it all , a chain of events linked hand to hand even as they were dancing . Circling dizzily , raising their hands to strain at something grand ,  |p199straining  and reaching before falling back to earth again  --  what more could he wish than that their love might be a chain of good and a gambol of gladness , begetting good , good people , good , plentiful life , and children , too , to carry on the dance . Let Good begin the dance . All that day Moore had prayed for the grace just to be , for the grace not to think , judge or criticize anyone  --  not even poor Bertie and his unfortunate toast . Moore got his wish , pretty much . Later , when he saw Bertie with Pinsent , it hardly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the young man 's ear . Nor would he think of how pleased Russell must be now that events had proved him right : sure enough , Wittgenstein had left the Apostles . Wittgenstein was the last person Moore wanted to think about . Moore especially wanted to forget the scene Wittgenstein had made two weeks ago , a few days before he went to Vienna for the summer . This was the day when North Whitehead ( now off talking to that handsome woman not his wife ) had challenged one of his pupils to a rowing race . The three of them , he , Russell and Pinsent , had been there . Russell was rooting for his old partner . The moment the gun went off , Russell was calling hoarsely through his cupped hands , Pull , North ! Pull ! Whitehead hove strong for the first two hundred yards  --  not bad for a man over fifty . But then he broke and his young opponent surged ahead , lunging to the finish in long , powerful strokes . North was badly beaten ; it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wind . It was then that Wittgenstein erupted . He said they might as well have watched a bullfight ; it was just as brutal and senseless . Russell should have known better than to argue  --  he said the same later  --  but instead he came back , You just do n't understand the virtue of competition . Virtue ! Wittgenstein snarled . Dogs tearing out each other 's entrails  --  that 's what this is ! Suddenly his eyes got small ; his finger was like a cocked pistol at Russell 's nose . Great works ! he railed . Only these have value . This is so vile we do n't deserve to live ! It smells of the slaughterhouse , your races ! Russell was too thunderstruck to respond . Leave him , he ordered Pinsentwhen Pinsent started after him . Now , really , Russell repeated . Do you hear me ? Leave off , said Pinsent with a glare , and with that , he went after him . Later , they all had different views of the incident . Moore thought it was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them being together . Russell , on the other hand , thought it was a hysterical reaction to their latest battle over another one of his theories . Both explanations werep200correct , so far as they went . Only Pinsent knew what else lay behind it : Wittgenstein 's father was dying . Wittgenstein 's sister Gretl had written him a few days before , but he told no one but Pinsent . Even now , at Moore 's wedding , Pinsent was still the only one who knew . One thing was certain : Pinsent was looking quite prosperous on Moore 's wedding day . Moore was n't the only one to have remarked at this new blue worsted wool suit and the silk cravat fastened with a gold pin . Burnished brogues still squeaky from the bootmaker , buffed to a hue by the man in the loo . And crowning it all , a dark fedora tapped to a rakish tilt with the brim snapped down just so . Flo had also gotten some new togs and would soon get a settlement as well . The roof was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was even a girl to cook and tidy . Flo was goose purple with excitement . They were rich ! German money , you know , whole pots of it ! Why , Davy was even taking her on a seaside holiday ! Oh , it made her head spin to think of it , she did so love the sea . England was surrounded with it , you know . Much as Pinsent missed Wittgenstein , he was glad his friend was not there with him now . No , Pinsent was flustered enough as he searched the floor for a dancing partner . Oh , go on , he told himself , giving himself a mental push . If he could wear a vain hat , he thought , he could bloody well ask a girl to dance ! For an hour Pinsent had had his eye on her , one of the bridesmaids , a girl about his height , with dark hair and green eyes . She looked shy , the way she kept adjusting her corsage . The soles of his new shoes creaked as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She did n't refuse ! And pretty , too ! But he was a clumsy oaf , feeling the heat from her perspiring back as he forced conversation , noticing the heavy smell of her corsage . Katherine , her name was , Dorothy 's cousin . Twice they danced before she thanked him , saying , with conspicuous politeness , that she wanted to speak to her uncle . Stiff as he thanked her . About face , his neck flaming . Same old story . The usual rot . And sure enough , he saw her dancing later with someone taller , better looking , more confident . Dratted new hat ! Stupid vanity ! For his penance , Pinsent left it sitting brazenly on the rack , too dwindled and shamed to wear it home . Russell was in a similar state . Pained about his toast and now feeling the sag of drink , he was just noticing how the flowers on the tables were beginning to brown at the edges . He could see Moore up on the dais , rubicund and doting , soaring with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paps from that draining bottle . Ottoline would bloody well be sorry for her neglect , he assured himself . Indignant now , he thoughtp201he might even have himself an affair  --  perhaps this very afternoon ! Who , then ( since all were susceptible to his charm ) ? That woman over there , the one with the pretty mouth and promising-looking bosom ? Or the more matronly one there with the bored look ? A widow would n't dally ; she would know that life was short . He knew it , too , but for his penance he decided that for now , at least , he would remain the wronged , virtuous one . And could n't he smile to himself , thinking of old Moore fumbling through his wedding night . But then Russell 's mirth bit back , reminding him that the groom , unlike himself , would bring home much more tonight than a hangover . Then the bar was closed . The musicians were packing up , and a motorcar was waiting outside to whisk the weary couple to their hotel , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ escape . Ringing his glass with a butter knife , Bertie Moore announced that the groom would first serenade the bride . Sing ! cried the delighted crowd . Mortified , Moore wanted to crown his brother , but then came the clapping chant : The-groom-shall-sing ! **37;14942;TOOLONG ! Very well , said Moore with a wince . I 'll sing , I 'll sing . He looked at Dorothy . Foggy , Foggy Dew ? Perfect ! cried Bertie Moore . The groom will now sing Froggy , Froggy Dew ! There was laughter , clapping and a gay tinkling of glasses as the couple were led to a piano in need of tuning . Arranging her long dress around the bench , Dorothy sounded a few chords while Moore , flushed and nervous , called for a glass of water , then turned to warm up with a sound like gargling . Tie cockeyed , cummerbund sagging , slightly drunk , the groom then turned his girth toward the audience and nodded for his wife to begin . In her nervousness , Dorothy played the opening chords too quickly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rolling ship until at last they merged . Who else Moore 's age could have sung so achingly such a naive , iir ? Several women clasped their breasts as he strained to reach the high , sweet , sharp notes , his eyes closed as he mournfully moaned : Song of my youth , song of my heart . She was a slip of a girl I kissed larking in the heather , But she skipped away singing , In the foggy , foggy dew , In the foggy , foggy dew .. .  |p202MOORE  'S SUMMER was both an idyll and a shock  --  to suddenly find himself a husband and son-in-law shanghaied by meals , chores , budgets . Russell 's summer , by comparison , was one of doubt and drift . He fell heavily after that . For Russell , the feeling was like the outbreak of illness , mounting when he did not expect it , then bursting into fever when it seemed he was at last putting his life and wounded theories back together . The theory of types was n't the only casualty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's newest , and perhaps boldest , construct , the theory of judgment . This , so far as Russell could see , had been the impetus behind Wittgenstein'soutburst at the rowing race . Guilt was the cause of Wittgenstein'sfury . To him , that image of Whitehead sagging over the oars was an all too gruesome reminder of how he had just savaged his own mentor'swork . In his better moments , Russell blamed himself for this . It was he , after all , who felt compelled to show Wittgenstein his judgment theory in those last hurried days before term ended and Wittgenstein left for Vienna . In his anxiety , Russell had invited the attack just as surely as if he had dangled fresh meat before a tiger . Russell was still reeling from that confrontation . And he had had such great hopes for this new theory , which he envisioned as a culmination of logic , physics and psychology . In the most basic sense , Russell meant for the theory to be a model of the act of judgment , of what occurs when we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well knew , this was tricky , because there remained the problem of accounting for how a person might judge as true what is not the case . But there was much more than this behind the theory . In it Russell was still pursuing his great objection to the idealists ' notion that we are never in touch with anything in the world outside our own minds . The task was to determine what we can truly know outside of ourselves , and it required a theory that might , so to speak , open the mind to China trade with the external world . Yet here again the philosopher felt the goad ofp203science , the siren call of the Big Synthesis . Rising to Wittgenstein 's own example , Russell felt once more the desire to do something brave and unifying , to sound a chord that would even merge with the new fugues of physics . For lack of a better name , Russell now called his scientific philosophy logical atomism . And , much as Wittgenstein disliked isms , it was a course that they both were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statements down to molecular and even atomic forms that it seemed must somehow correspond with the atomic facts of our sense perceptions  --  or at least the facts of the world . No , thought Russell , physicists were n't the only ones doing exciting things nowadays . But , oh , it made his head spin to think how he might unravel this tangled skein . How was he to reconcile the concerns of physicswith those of epistemology ? Whereas physics exhibits sensations as functions of physical objects , epistemology demands that physical objects be exhibited as functions of sensations . And look at the sorts of things he would have to harmoniously bring together : perceptions , which are purely mental events ; abstract properties , such as " greenness " and " softness " ; and , externally , quite physical objects such as grass and earth . And even as he had begun plotting out this grand work of unification , he could imagine Wittgenstein cautioning him that names are not the names of things , that we do n't know what names are , except that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tree . It was uphill work , but still the work had been progressing . So why , Russell would think in those confused days that followed Wittgenstein 's attack , why this acute need to show it to him ? Russell knew what he had done the moment he thrust the critical pages in Wittgenstein 's hands and bade him sit down and read . Watching him , Russell saw all the danger signs : the foot tapping and chin rubbing , then the sudden irritability as Wittgenstein jumped up . Facing him then , Wittgenstein was trapped ; Russell knew , just as surely if he had planned the whole thing , what Wittgensteinwould say  --  that his theory was irreparably , impossibly wrong . Wittgenstein could not even say very clearly why it was wrong . He was groping and inarticulate as he explained  --  more or less  --  that the theory still could not account for how the mind might judge as true something that was nonsensical , such as , " This table penholders the book . " But this again was consistent with Wittgenstein 's vision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a thing held aloof from the mind with its carping judgments . Equally damning , Wittgenstein found the theory presumptuous . What need , he asked , had the world , or logic , of a subject mind who judges ? This was nothing but a fiction belonging top204certain primitive notions of psychology . As far as logic was concerned , mind was the proverbial tree that fell unheard in the forest : in the realm of logic , mind had no hegemony  --  none whatsoever . From his side , Wittgenstein was hardly unaware of the irony of Russell'sasking him to judge his theory of judgment within a poisonous atmosphereof compounding judgment . Here once more , Wittgenstein felt the mocking animus of logic mimicking their very conflicts. , Again , it was this lie of fairness and objectivity  --  the deluded and , at bottom , mendaciousnotion that either of them could impartially judge the other 's work without regard for his own vision , values or self-interest . But for Wittgenstein the worst lie was Russell 's apparent blindness to their predicament . Russell was n't asking an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew that he was rendering more than just an objective assessment of the truth as he saw it . Even the " truth " was a lie . Russell 's fledgling theory was crude compared to the web of judgments that were then in progress . Judgments of judgments . Judgments in fear of judgments . Judgments fending off further judgments , one 's own or another 's . Wittgenstein even saw his own grand lie  --  this pretense that he did not know what he was doing as he killed Russell 's theory , like some William Tell who closed his eyes in order to shoot straight . In the confused days that followed , there were times when Russell could hardly remember what Wittgenstein had said ; in his despair , he could but dimly recall why he had even propounded the theory . Secluded in his rooms , Russell felt like a boy conjugating as he thought : Actually , the reason behind the theory was .. . Well , if the theory were true , it would enable us to .. . It was a grand idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become .. . But the most remarkable virtue of the theory , if it could be realized , would be to .. . They managed to patch things up before Wittgenstein left for Vienna . At the station , they both struggled to be cordial , the better to disguise this lie or what perhaps was the finer distinction : the impossibility for either to be honest without injury to the other . Friendly and hale , sad but mostly relieved , they expressed hope for the next year and future endeavors . Lingering there , shaking hands in that second before Wittgensteinboarded , they never dreamed that it would be seven years and a war before they 'd meet again . But matters between them were far from settled , especially on Russell'sp205end . For Russell , there would be the burden of how Wittgenstein 's harsh verdict of his judgment theory would temporarily occlude Russell 's own sense of judgment . Russell never saw this train coming ; it blindsided him . Why , he felt just fine . He was n't Icarus falling . As Einstein had opined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ falling at various speeds . Indeed , for all the moving and falling of one 's time , it was difficult and perhaps pointless to estimate one 's speed or trajectory . Rather , people were like particles in suspension , some floating up , ascendant , while others sank inexorably to the bottom . But , really , it was n't so bad , this topsy-turvydom . Eating one 's way into this Land of Cockaigne , m'lord , the bread is verily like cake , fleshly fresh and white . Behold , uncle , how we burrow through this blighted loaf , through even the air holes and moldy portions , tunneling like weevils to that other , fabled side where one needs bring only his appetite  --  where , ' t is said , juicy roasted fowls and dainties fly right into one 's open mouth ! No , Russell saw no need to despair ; he was n't even near the bottom . And anyhow , there were milestones and diversions along the way  --  Ottolinefor one . Several months before , in deference to Philip 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trysts ( and hers with Lamb ) a little flat in Maida Vale , a middle-class neighborhood located a few miles northwest of Bloomsbury . Their landlady , or jailer , was an older , ill-tempered widow . Mrs. Dood was her name . Russell hated the arrangement and he loathed Mrs. Dood for being a scrounger and busybody and , as he believed , a reformed prostitute . For him , even the down-at-the-heels Nabob was preferable to this . Darling , Russell would grouse . I would prefer filth and black beetles to this . Fine ! Ottoline would reply . You find something reasonably clean and discreet for three guineas per month . Be my guest ! I 've tried . This would shut him up , but it still did n't ease his discontent . Mrs. Dood insisted that they arrive and depart separately , and invariably it was Russell who would be there first . Ottoline was habitually late , sometimesby as much as an hour . Oh , he hated it . No sooner would he enter the reeking hallway than Alf , Mrs. Dood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open the door with his key , he would see the omniscientMrs . Dood peeking through her eyehole while scratching , scrapping Alf stuck his snoot under the door and loudly sneezed , hoping to catch the intruder 's scent . Inside , the flat was stuffy and shut-up smelling , with the drafty acous/tics of a place where nobody lived . The furniture was mismatched , secondhandstuff , the walls bare and the cupboards empty except for a jar of peppermints arid the sassafras tea a doctor had prescribed for Ottoline'sdigestion . A coiled douching apparatus was secreted in the bath , along with a jar of lubricant . Swallowed in a faded green armchair , peeringthrough his arched fingers , Russell would wait and wait , his mood going from expectancy to anger , then to black despair . Ottoline would arrive with profuse apologies and explanations  --  alibisno sooner made than she expected forgiveness , and woe to him if he showed any lingering resentment . Then she 'd climb on her high horse , quick to remind him of what tremendous lengths it took to see him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and apologetic , he was the guilty one then , all the while conscious of the time ticking away . By the time they got down to lovemaking  --  or bickering about lovemaking  --  there was no time , and their efforts foundered . Worse , Ottoline 's migraineswere acting up again , making it hard for her to bear his hobbyhorsing . He always brought wine , the libation no sooner uncorked than he was plying her small , upturned breasts through folds of bottle-green silk , fumblingwith the buttons that Ottoline 's maid , Brindy , had fastened that morning , wrapping her lady up for him like a pricey parcel . A small heap of discarded underthings fell to the floor : the silk slip and purple stockings , the lacy deckle-edged drawers and pointy black shoes shaped like Venetian gondolas . He so wanted to remember everything that he would greedily try to squirrel it all in his memory , so busy looking and remembering that it seemed he missed it even as it was occurring . Like a sweet held in the side of the mouth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sucking on them until at last they dissolved down to nothing . But here she was in the flesh , he would tell himself . Here was his chance and he must make the most of it . Oh ! he 'd gasp . Her lanky shanks ! Oh , her rump ! He was ready in an instant  --  the Burrower , she called him , always trying to jam himself in , ready or not . This was bad enough , but then in late June , not long before Ottoline took her migraines to a Swiss sanitarium , she averted her face from his kiss . What ! he demanded . I hate your squeamishness . What is it ? She was embarrassed to say , but with prodding she came clean , saying that it was n't just squeamishness . It was his breath . He was thunderstruck . My breath ? Why did you never tell me ? Ottoline smoothed his neck . I did n't want to hurt your feelings . Besides , she hedged , it was n't always so bad.  |p207He  chewed up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Smell your breath ? Ottoline recoiled in horror . I 'd rather kiss you ! Then kiss me , damn it ! She kissed him , then drew away , smirking . No better ? Damn ! Must be the pipe , do n't you think ? Well , I shall see the dentist while you 're away  --  I promise . For all her kindnesses , Ottoline was never kinder than when she was leaving . Then she would revert to her Florence Nightingale self , valiantly striving to put him back together . Still , she could not undo the mark of her leaving  --  an extravagant kiss , then the rap of her sharp heels down that narrow hallway reeking of boiled mutton . Through the window , Russell would watch her wide plumed hat undulating as she sailed down Sooty Lane past ragged , scowling children and the shrill row house women who called after her : Will yer look at ' er ! Miss Ta-ta ! ' Ey , yer Majesty ! And later , fuming , Russell would be driven down the same public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cackling . ' Ere we are , Princey . Throw us a kiss , love ! Awwww .. . Standing on the platform later , Russell would close his eyes as the shrieking 6:05 enveloped him in pulverizing darkness , dragging and mashing him before he awoke with a shudder , wreathed in steam , and quietly boarded . Second-class carriage  --  still pinched these days , what with the continuing drain of Alys . Traveling home , he would already be writing his next letter to Ottoline , another relentless analysis of what was wrong between them . And each trip , under the radiant darkness on a hill far out in the country , near Wenden , he would see a ruined stone cottage . Beside the cottage , dark as a shadow , was a fir tree . Standing like an upraised palm , it seemed to beckon or warn him , and with twisted mouth , he would avert his face , feeling , without a clue why , that he would suddenly start weeping . Then Ottoline left for the spa in Lausanne , where , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of whole cow 's milk cut with brewer 's yeast and radium . " I now know why they call it radium , " she wrote . With a draught of this heavenly cocktail , she said , she felt like an icon of the Virgin surrounded by rays of hammered gold , her hidden passion . Open to receive were her aching arms  --  open as if , like the Blessed Vierge , she had dropped the babe . But , oh , so melting she felt as she watched him fall helplessly to earth , poor dear . ( She would pray for him . ) " Dearest Bertie , " she wrote , " if only you could see the world from up here . " ( Ip208was n't invited ! ) " If only you could fling away the world with its dross and foolish cares . " ( I 'm busy and have no money ! ) " If only for once , my love , you could see inside my mind . " ( Idle bitch ! Give me a lamp ! ) Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even more than Ottoline 's usual letters . In them , she was always reproaching herself for being a basically ignorant woman , while yet insisting , as if something had been denied her , that she had a poet 's feel for the voluptuousness of earth . Like a window , she had opened herself to the spirit , she said . Like a radiant window , she prayed that he , too , would open himself to it and quit his atheistic thinking . Really , her letter would continue , it was the most gorgeous summer , such a wonderful age was upon us . And Philip was such a dear , so understanding and undemanding , such a deeply spiritualman , actually . With Philip her mind was free , never weighed like dead fish on a scale . Through the swashing , radiant grass , they would walk down the mountainsides looking for purple gentians , the most intenseof flowers , with deep , dark purple cups that reminded her of Christ 's passion . And looking down , she saw her mind was melting like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pouring down the valleysas a herdsman blew his alpenhorn . The cows were coming home . Then toward the second week , she met a Dr. Vittoz , who changed her life utterly and absolutely . For Dr. Vittoz , she kept a diary in which she was to practice eliminating unnecessary letters from words and unnecessarywords from sentences , and finally whole paragraphs filled with unnecessary fears and habits of mind that for years had plagued her . By her third week , Ottoline was shedding whole books of fear . And such joyful tears she shed  --  as through a cloud spent of all thunder , they sieved clear through her . Really , she advised , he ought to try eliminating , ought to try jettisoning all the weight of intellect that only bogged him down and tortured his soul . Really , she said , he ought to try . It was so very lovely to forget  --  just to gaze out where the snow rested on the mountains and the fat cattle stood knee deep in the grassy meadows . She felt as she did when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an enormous bulb germinating . It was an adventure to change , and she was changing ever so rapidly  --  even Dr. Vittoz said so . There were these young girls who danced for them at night in their dirndls , with their hair newly shorn and eyes so impossibly bright . They made her feel old , but then Ottoline eliminated that as well , writing old , then ol , then , o . . . By the third week she was sure of it : a momentous change was upon the world . There were so many of them up there , Swiss and German , English and French , Italians , Russians , even a Lithuanian . At night theyp209spoke of outbreaks of influenza and said alarming things about money and politics that she did not understand , nor want to . And then one night they made a pact that if ever the world collapsed under a disaster or war , they would come to Lausanne with Dr. Vittoz , where they would work with their eliminating books , washing away dreadnoughts and greed , money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this eternalpeace and blessedness . She met so very many people . Among the guests there was a priest and an industrialist , a physicist and his wife . There was even a Hindu , who had given her the Bhagavad-Gita to read . But the Hindu book was so violent in places , like the Old Testament or mythology  --  why was it , she wrote , that the ancients were so tainted with thoughts of bloodshed and violence , with gods always smiting and breaking into different forms , appearing as burning bushes , swans and such ? That was not her religion . She said she also met an Italian painter  --  a Futurist , he called himself , Vorno was his name . Fearfully beautiful , he was , powerful and dark , with a wolflike face and bad teeth . Every day , recklessly , he would race his bicycle down the mountainside , heedless of sudden turns , animals and drays , people . Vorno said the Futurists gloried in danger , speed and struggle ; they loved brutal locomotives , aeroplanes and powerful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sacred economy of life , forever destroying for the sake of onwardness . Yes , Vorno said , he and his comrades were anarchists and murderers , not toothless lap dogs , like these English painters painting nudes and bottles for the licentious rich . Worse were the French  --  except for Braque , he despised them , too . Sack the museums ! Torch the past ! Vorno said the human body must be painted in motion  --  must be shown streaked with savage force lines , like the hideous , blood-streaked face of an Indian warrior . The other guests thought Vorno would break his neck as he hurtled down the mountain roads , whisk whisk in the turns , his head inclined over the bars like a battering ram . Someone said it was a terminal illness that made him so reckless , but Ottoline thought it was his mind . Vorno took the waters , but he sneered at their eliminating . Throw down these idle worries ! Rise up and murder the old world ! Embrace the evernewnessof high-production machines and factories ! War was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was itself a ferociously beautiful machine , one that would propel mankind into revolutions more beautiful than The Victory at Samothrace ! Vorno chilled them , he did . They were all much relieved when he left after a row . It was a scandal , Ottoline said . Missing billfolds , and onep210guest with both eyes blackened and a fractured skull . Unpaid bills and Vorno 's room a shambles , the walls painted with terrible war engines and dynamos and the legend VICTOIRE . The police were into it now . There were even whispers about the wife of the man with blackened eyes  --  apparently , she was but one of the women he had had , spitting them out , one man said , as a wolf does bloody hen feathers . With Vorno gone , the guests returned , like atoning monks , to their eliminating , a process that Dr. Vittoz likened to untying the knots they spent their whole lives tangling . Still , looking down from her mountaintop , beholding the world with its fragile lights , Ottoline was tormented by the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had spent days unraveling . Dr. Vittoz assured her that this was natural . This mischief would pass , he promised . Nevertheless , Ottoline spent much of the night praying , fearful of this beauty that was upon them . Oh , it made Russell ill , this spirit muck and eliminating . But what Russell most feared was that Ottoline would eliminate him . Alone and adrift , Russell was then writing Our Knowledge of the ExternalWorld , a series of lectures he was to deliver at Harvard the followingsummer . His theory of judgment was central to this unifying effort , but his theory , like his confidence , was broken , and his work took anotherdive . Wittgenstein 's letters did n't help matters . Just prior to Ottoline 's departure , Wittgenstein had finally sent word about his father , saying that he would not survive the summer . Wittgenstein continued : In the afternoon I sit beside his bed , sometimes talking or playing a recordedsymphony , but mostly in silence . It is hard to come to this point , when two humans have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to outlive my father , but now I see that even this will come to pass . It is terrifying , the kinds of mental torment there can be .. . Russell had replied with a sympathetic letter , but still he had n't been able to resist asking Wittgenstein if he might better explain his objections to his theory of judgment . Wittgenstein found this imposition enough ; Russell did not help matters by adding that Wittgenstein 's criticisms had " paralysed " him . Wittgenstein complied with Russell 's request , but his answer was not much help : terse to the point of being telegraphic , he largely repeated his objections , capping them off with what seemed an even more draconian judgment :  |p211I  am very sorry to hear that my objections to your theory of judgment paralyse you . I think it can be resolved only by a correct theory of propositions .. . This was no help . It was an insult . Immediately , Russell sent Wittgensteinanother letter  --  this one distinctly irritable in tone  --  requesting additional details , or at least some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for me to repeat an explanation that I gave the first time only with the greatest possible repugnance . What kind of world we live in , or how we judge it , is not for logic to decide . Evidently , Wittgenstein regretted his harshness . The next day he sent Russell a second letter : I am sorry I was so abrupt in my last letter . I also want to add that your theory of descriptions is quite certainly correct , even though the individual primitive signs in it are not at all the ones you thought . Do not suppose that I take any pleasure in saying this . It is frightful to have destroyed so much and produced so little . Just now I am thinking of my reaction to you , the day Whitehead lost the race . My reaction was shameful ; but the reason , it seems to me , was quite valid and important . Our quarrel was not caused by your sensitiveness or by my haste and inconsiderateness . It came from something much deeper  --  from the fact that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different . You may say that we ourselves are not so very different , but our ideals could not be more so . And that is why we sha n't ever be able to talk about anything involving our value judgments without either becoming hypocriticalor falling out . I think this is incontestable . This can not be cleared up in a conversation , let alone a letter . And this last quarrel was just one of many instances . Now , as I am writing this , I am completely calm . I can readily see that your value judgments are just as valid as mine , and that I have no right to catechise you . At the same time , I can not impede my work by struggling to find a common mould for our concepts . Months ago I realised this , and I found it frightful , because it so tainted our relations ; we seemed to be sitting side by side in a marsh . The fact is we both have weaknesses , but especially I have , and in spite of what you always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But if a relationship is not to be degrading for both sides , it must not be prey to the weaknesses on either side . Now you 'll probably say that things have been worked out , and will continue to be worked out . But you see I 'm sick of the whole sordid compromise  --  on your end and mine . So far my life has been one nasty mess  --  but need that go on forever ?  |p212I  beg you to think this over and to send me an answer only when you can do so without bitterness . Feel assured in any case of my love and loyalty . I only hope you will understand this letter as it is meant to be understood . , Russell was still thinking of how to respond to this letter when another arrived : Dear Russell , My father died yesterday in the afternoon . He had the most beautiful death that I can imagine , without the slightest pain and falling asleep like a child ! I did not feel sad for a single moment during all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most joyful , and I think that his death was worth a whole life . I will be here two or three weeks more . Then I shall leave for Norway . I will not be returning to Cambridge next term , nor in the forseeable future . I doubt you will approve of this course , but please do not say things we will both regret by trying to convince me otherwise . I can say only that it is a course , and that I will follow it insofar as God permits me to see it . Despite our differences , your letters are a great boon to me , and I hope you will continue to write once I settle someplace . Until then , I remainYours ever , L.W.Not long before this time , Russell had finally seen a dentist about his halitosis . Bibbed and reclining in the wooden chair , he closed his eyes as rotund Mr. Geach focused the brilliant dial fixed to his forehead , then probed Russell 's gums with a fat finger . There we are . . . Em  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the air whistling through his hairy nostrils , Geach registered a look of surprise , then disappeared into the other room and returned with a medical book . Russell took a sip of the bile-colored antiseptic on the stand beside him , spat into the steel bowl and quipped , Is it that bad ? He looked up anxiously but only got a finger in the mouth . Geeeth ! he lisped . Whahtth ithh issht ? The dentist exhaled loudly . You 'll want a second opinion . You must understand that I 'm not at all expert in this . Russell sat up in the chair . Expert in what ? I see several lesions on your gum . Geach steeled himself , then said it . It 's possible you have a cancer . Russell lapsed back in disgust.  |p213Remember  , cautioned Geach , I 'm not sure .. . But Russell was n't even listening . I-le thought , If it 's cancer , I 'll throw myself under a train . One specialist said possibly cancer and sent him to a second specialist , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early to tell . The second did remove the lesions , though , then gave his gums a thorough scraping that he thought would end his halitosis . As for the rest , they 'd have to see how his gums healed . Eight weeks would surely tell the story . As a boy , Russell had lost his Uncle Mortimer to mouth and throat cancer . Russell could still see his uncle with a handkerchief , dabbing the ooze that issued like tobacco juice from the red ulcerations on his seared lower lip . Russell promised himself a quick dive under a train before it came to that . Gone in a roaring . In the meantime , he told no one about the news , not even Ottoline , grimly deciding to hug it close to him , for shame , for pleasure . He could not die , not really . For all his fantasies of death , he still did n't believe he could part from this life , or it from him . Death , rather , was an idea he could explore in much the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , rueful and smarting with its presence , like a sweet on a carious tooth . And maybe it was better he quit the field now , Russell thought . He knew what Wittgenstein was saying between the lines . Likely his best work was behind him . Well , if so , he thought , he must make room for the younger generation . Wittgenstein could take his place ; Russell would still have his reputation . As for his darker thoughts , these , too , he stanched with fantasies of grief-stricken Ottoline , the line of mourners and the lengthy obituaries . The happy narcissism of death . For days Russell was in a sort of delirium , half anxious , half rapturous with the presence of this death , which lay against his life like a shadow against a hill . He could indulge himself now . He wrote brave , romantic couplets and read the life of Mozart . For the first time in years , he even allowed himself to routinely do the things that he supposed ordinary people do , dining out , going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One day he even decided he would get pleasantly tight . Bringing three bottles of wine with him , he went down to the Cam and took out a punt . Ah , the tang of dry , tart wine in the hot , hot sun ! The sluggish water was cool . He let his wrist trail in it as he drifted along under the willows fluttering with their tentative green . With each sip , sweat sprang to his skin , flashing cool then hot with the wind 's refrain.  |p214Unused  to drink in any quantity , he first thought himself crafty , but within an hour he was freely grinning as he rammed one punt , then accidentallysplashed a lady with his pole while valiantly fending off a secondcollision . Oh , he was sorry ! he cried to the spattered woman and the irate gentleman with her . Percolating his p 's as he blathered back , P-ppardonme ! . . . Is the laaady all  --  fine ? Get off the water , you drunken idiot ! As he raised his arms to plead forgiveness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man 's face and stumbled back , nearly capsizing as he sat with a splat in the dirty bilge water . The day declined . Bottoming the third bottle , he heard the twang of a guitar , then saw a boating party , young swains in cream whites and their young ladies . He stood and , rocking , waved farewell to that , too . Wan and nostalgic , he then lay back across the seat , noticing his feet spreadeagled before him , pointing as they would point for an eternity , useless and skewed . Looking up then , he saw a girl peering down at him from the arched stone bridge , smiling as the sun fanned through her hair . For a moment , he imagined her flame-red hair spreading in strands across his face , and then he saw himself pulling her open mouth to his . But then this image curdled ; and , inserting his finger under his lip , he probed that rawness , stunned by the thought of a wild , weedlike growth that would clog his head and choke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down his half-insensible length , scratching the shriveled nub between his legs , he felt like Gulliver tied by the threads of Lilliputians , dazzled , as blackbirds twittered overheadin a whir of wings .. . Back at his rooms he fell heavily to sleep , then awoke in stuffy darkness , hung over , thirsty and confused . It took him an hour to wash , eat , shave and settle himself . Shaky , penitent , he then opened Ottoline 's latest letter . More bad news . She was prolonging her stay in Lausanne . Another week eliminating . Enough ! Sitting down , Russell dashed off a letter chiding her for frivolousnessand selfishness and demanding that she come home . For three scathing pages he continued before a milder , more speculative tone crept in  --  a foreign voice , older and wiser than his own . By the fourth page , Russell realized he was n't even writing to Ottoline , he was writing to Wittgenstein . But he was n't really writing , he was speaking , and the person he was addressing was n't quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was an older , haunted man speaking to a brilliant younger man  --  speaking in the manner of a Socratic dialogue.  |p215Russell  hardly dared breathe for fear it would end . But it did n't end ; it only became more urgent . For twenty pages the older man answered the younger man 's questions and objections , all the while growing more confused . With burning eyes , Russell followed the curls of his scratching pen until three A.M. , whereupon he fell heavily to sleep . But again at seven , as if jabbed by a current , he awoke and returned to his desk , watching as the phantom hand picked up the pen and resumed writing , transcribingthis inner voice . His bed maker , Mrs. Phelps , was a motherly sort who fussed over him and the other bachelor dons . He usually chatted with her when she arrived , but that morning he dashed back to his desk , still furiously scribblingas she set to work , beating air into his pillows and sweeping . Why , Mr. Russell ! she gasped the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at work all this time ? Paper littered the floor . Hunted , his eyes . Yes ! he cried . And , by God , it 's good , good , good ! Look at this ! Eighty ... eighty-five . . . ninety-five pages since yesterday ! Well , sir , she allowed , surveying the disarray . That 's all very nice , but you ought to sleep , you should . Truthfully , you do look a bit pale and shaky , sir . ' Ave you eaten ? Have I eaten ? he asked , uprooting his hair . Who can think of food at a time like this ! Just the same , sir , I 'm going to send Mr. Prichert 's boy to fetch you something . Yes , do that , he said distractedly , scrawling another line . And pipe tobacco , please . He pushed some change into her hand . And tea and milk , Mrs. Phelps  --  and crackers . And thank you ! God , look at this , will you ? I 've never had such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it had grown into a full-blown novel called The Perplexitiesof John Forstice . Forstice , the protagonist , had grown younger and handsomer than the old man who began the dialogues . Nearing forty , prematurely gray and unmarried , Forstice was now a famous physicist , an atheist and freethinker known for his cynicism and cool brilliance . But then Forstice takes as his student Thomas Graf , a pure , clear-thinkingGerman who debunks Forstice 's theory of electrogravitation , then runs off to Norway , leaving his teacher on the Jobian dungheap , plagued by doubts about physics , human progress , himself . Yet here Russell wondered : Was the story perhaps too familiar and self-indulgent , too cen/tered on Forstice ? All right , thought Russell , let the outer world mirror Forstice 's feverish state . Forstice must have conflict  --  a war , then , somethingbiblical ! And let 's , while we 're at it , make Forstice more vulnerable and human , not such a fire-breathing atheist . We 'll make him , say , a Quaker and man of peace , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of nature . More ! ordered the Author . The book must have even more conflict , something splendidly mechanicaland Wellsian . That 's it ! thought Russell , who was , as it were , the Author 's secretary . Nature betrays Forstice ! Nature plants a bomb . And not just a bomb but a gravitational bomb developed from the one theory that Graf has n't savaged  --  a bomb that can destroy ships and harbors ! Oh , go on , said the insatiable Author , throwing caution to the wind . Let the bomb destroy whole cities ! Russell could hardly stoop to pick up all the baubles popping from his teeming brain . Serve up one war . And one plague . And let 's put Forstice in a refuge , a mountain sanitarium or something . Right ! He meets a nun , a tall , slender nun named Sister Catherine , who eats peppermints and suffers migraines . And let her also be suffering a spiritual crisis , what with the plague and God being such a beast , letting the world ride to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's taking radium and carrying on with some therapeutic regime called  --  what ? Elimination ? No , no , blot that , old boy , we must protect the innocent . All right , then  --  Subtraction ! But it must be larger , the Author insisted . More characters , then ! One Futurist . And a window-breaking feminist and a deranged misogynist like Strindberg . And a Madame Blavatsky and a Kiplingesque imperialist with a little brown Indian boy who calls him sahib . More ! cried the indefatigableAuthor . Very well , then . A Prussian militarist and a deposed monarch , an anarchist , a plutocrat and a socialist named Shifsky . All right , old boy , Russell cackled to himself . The gluepot is simmering ! Riots outside the sanitarium gates . London in flames . Swarming like ants across blackened plains , armies leave a tide of plagues , starvation and burning heaps of dead . And all the while in their mountain nest the charactersare talking , talking , talking . But wait ! cried the Author . What happened to Graf ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the antigravity secret that can stop the gravity bombs . It was his Ecclesiastes , his Decameron and Masque of the Red Death . Would Russell ever forget the feeling when , twenty-three days later , he penned that last , poignant paragraph ? All his authorial wishes had been fulfilled . There was even a happy ending to ensure snappy sales . Graf had appeared with his antigravity formula , thereby ending the war . Forstice ,  |p217meanwhile  , had undertaken a whole new generation of theories that promised to change the course of physics . As for Sister Catherine , she had gotten off her priedieu and was now Catherine Belusys again . She had stopped her vain subtracting and had begun adding  --  yes , she had torn off her musty habit and become Mrs. John Forstice . Capping off those last pages of Forstice 's internal soliloquy , Russell wrote : Blindly and helplessly , going none know whence , going none know whither , men voyage across this lonely desert . Vainly , they reach for this or that , they snatch the cup of water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drops on the burning sands , but the infinite pain remains . Day after day , night after night , men look out upon the vastness of the world : the sea beats upon the shore , the sun rises and sets , the starlight reaches us only after years of lonely voyaging through space . But human existence , in spite of all its pain and degradation , is redeemed by any portion , short or long , great or small , of knowledge or beauty or love ; and the greatest of these is love . Its sudden rays pierce the astonished darkness of the outer night , and the mirror of sense reveals the undreamed visions of the soul . It was too perfect . Sitting in his drawers , with a ravished look of locusts and honey , Russell closed his eyes as grateful tears streamed down his face . He felt like a cathedral filled with music , balanced , voluminous , ringing . Surely , this was the best he 'd ever written , perhaps even his swan song . Promising himself not to look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the manuscript in a drawer , then went out to walk into the early coolness . Good morning ! he said somewhat impertinently to an old lady , who shot him a dirty look in return . He was not deterred . Buying a paper from the stumpy paperman , normally a three-second transaction , he paused to gab , then smiled at two children , who darted away , staring at their feet . Things ordinarily invisible to him  --  tradesmen , shopkeepers , idlers  --  all were transformed by his heroic act of imagination . Hello ! Fine day ! Splendid in his new spiritual feathers , the strutting author hailed them all , high or low , bent or straight , smiling with such intense beneficence that their first impulse was to flee . Ottoline returned in late August , utterly transformed , to hear her tell it . But over the next weeks , her new life unraveled just as surely as Russell 's own postcompletion euphoria did . Jis philosophical work resumed and foundered , resumed again . Overp218the next months , he finished Our Knowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was a professional  --  that is , because it was expected and not because he thought it was adequate . Harder still , he could not even say how the work might be remedied , except somehow to summon that lapsed sense of conviction . Wittgenstein had such conviction , that was what hurt . Russell could feel it in Wittgenstein 's letters from Norway , where it seemed something incalculable was happening . For the time , Russell pinned his hopes on Forstice . Ottoline was dying to read it , and he did nothing to dampen her expectations when he told her  --  and rather conservatively , he felt  --  that Forstice , if not outstanding , was at least quite solidly good . But still , Russell held to his original decision to let the manuscript breathe for a month before he or anyone else dipped into it . He was so excited . The truth was , he could hardly remember what he had written . Ottoline was even more excited when he said that her Lausanne letters had been the inspiration . Sly dog ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not . As it was , Russell did not see the radiantly eliminatedOttoline until the second week of September  --  two unconscionableweeks after her return , when she finally got around to inviting him down to Studland . This time , as part of her own new spirit , Ottoline was entirely frank . Straightaway , she said they would not be alone . But to her surprise he did not cavil or moan . This , he was at pains to show her , was part of his new spirit , part of the aftermath of Forstice , which he said had given him a more stoical , resigned attitude to life . Expecting little , Russell was gratifiedto see that he rather enjoyed himself during those three days . At bottom , he knew that his feelings for Ottoline had dimmed , but this , he felt , was to be accepted rather than regretted . He was not unhappy or happy ; rather , he told himself , he was provisionally happy  --  content for now to see what life would bring , since life must bring something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ottoline about his possible cancer , though he did say he had seen the dentist . And she had to admit that his breath was better , even if sex was not . For her , the most insurmountable hurdle was still the cold buried mass of his intellect  --  this , like his views on religion , she would never eliminate . For the life of her , she could n't see the spiritual change he said he 'd undergone . Oh , she could see he was changing , all right  --  and rapidly . Only he was not changing in quite the ways he thought . Not long after his return from Studland , Russell was relieved , but not very , to be told that he did not have cancer . He was far more anxious ap219few days later when Forstice returned from the typist and he sat down , with trembling hands , to read what he had wrought . Dwarfs had been set loose in the temple of Art  --  nothing was as he remembered it . Impatientwithin ten pages , he was pained after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to chapter . At last , deeply chastened , he slipped the manuscript into a drawer and went for a walk , this time not saying a word to anyone and indeed wishing to crawl off somewhere and die . Several people , including Ottoline , said they liked Forstice , but he knew , at bottom , that they were just being kind . Still , Russell would outlive Forstice and Wittgenstein ; by growing steeply , hugely famous , he would survive them all . This was part of the transformation in him that Ottoline saw that summer . She saw it most clearly the day before he left Studland , while peering down through the viewing lens of her Kodak Graflex camera . Ottoline liked snapping her famous friends and guests  --  fodder for her photo album and the memoirs to come . She thought it immensely revealing , how a person faced the camera . Whereas some ignored or tolerated the lens , Russell clearly welcomed its intrusion . Canting his head , he would strike a triumphant grimace , his pipe poised like a pin to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way he would draw his chin into his neck ! Like a tortoise sucking into its shell , she thought , as he stared back with those cold , reptilian eyes . Yes , even then Ottoline could see that protective carapace forming . Russell was just becoming generally known , and there , peering down into the milky lens , Ottoline could see how the camera 's snout made him puff out his character . She could see him striving to show his best , most brazen side , and not the tentative one floating in that haze of light , shrinking from time 's judgments . Ottoline relished the power the camera gave her over him . There ! Like that ! she would order , and there he would stand , at full attention , trying to summon forth his posterity . Framing him in the jiggling lens , Ottoline would wait for perhaps a second longer than necessary , just to see him frozen there , waiting for the shutter 's jaws to snap.  |p220DEPARTING  FROM BERGEN on the Sweimfoss , Wittgenstein had sent Russell a short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is too congenial , so I am going up Sognefjord to someplace where I can think . They say that in this constant light birds fly till they fall from the air . May it make ideas germinate ! Believe it or not , I am reasonably happy . Like the reindeer , I gorge myself on the summer for there will be longer nights . Despite my moments of Sorge ( in Goethe 's sense of the word ) , I do not lose courage and go on thinking . Do n't you stop either , and do please write soon . Yours ever , L.W.The Sweimfoss was now about a hundred miles up the fjord , anchored for the night in a basin among a nest of mountains . Since they 'd left Bergen , three days had passed  --  or four ; in that endless daylight , it was easy to lose track of the time . Moored midway between dawn and dusk , the sky was filled with a deep , golden red darkness , a pooling , whorling red like the heartwood of cedar . Peering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sense of time suspended , floating in place , then resuming like those hypnotized birds above who , sinking , would suddenly remember to flap their wings . The Sweimfoss was an old , woodburning hauler eighty feet long and low slung in the middle , with a blunt bow that rose like the toe of a wooden shoe . Red cinders flew out her stacks , and oily rust and beads of pitch ran down her white wooden sides . In her hold was the sour , gamy scent of cheese , sour milk , dried halibut , half-cured reindeer hides and other cargo she carried . From the tall steeringhouse aft , the captain would blow his steam whistle as they made their endless stops at lumber camps , villages and outlying farms , where some dawdling boy would lead down a plow horse pulling a sledge to fetch groceries and mail-order tools from this floating post office and commissary.  |p221Wittgenstein  wanted a slow , cheap boat where they 'd put him to work , and the captain and the mate , who spoke some German , were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the steam engine . Grilling ham and potatoes , salted herrings and easy eggs . It felt so good to be active  --  healthy , unthinking , physical . Coming around a bend in the fjord , he might see ten miles of glassy water , water sometimes five hundred fathoms deep under a faint gloss of mist . Wittgenstein wished now to be as still and deep as these glacier-carved canyons . Slowly , a peaceful vision sense was floating down over him , an empty-headed gazing , like crossing one 's eyes in order to see . Under the four-square light , he would hear the distant thunder of summer avalanches . Looking up , he would see misty flumes pealing down the fjord 's sheer rock walls , the water tearing to rags , then to mist that infused his nostrils with the smell of rain . As through clearest crystal , the light streamed through him , with nothing now to impede it . Like a slow rain , the sky was falling , light to air , air to light ; like the sound of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burned on his closed eyelids . Red sky . Red Wittgenstein . It was midnight , and everyone was below asleep . With him on deck the only living thing was a pale brown cow with little knobbed horns who lay kneeling on her forelegs in a bed of straw . She was a sweet , docile bossy with a broad face , long ears and a heavy , four-fingered udder . Earlier , pressing his head against her soft , gurgling flank , Wittgenstein had milked her , thinking about God as the hot milk squirted in the tin bucket , ploot ploot ploot . Then as now he had felt the aspect of God . It was the imposition of that single struck key , that sense of being in agreement with the world and at last consigned to it . Red sky . Red cow . Red Wittgenstein . He had been in such a strange mood in these weeks since his father had died : excited , then more subdued , with an unaccountable sense of well-being and happiness . His sister Gretl had not been so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calm . In fact , she wondered if his father 's death had even hit him , or if subconsciously he even believed it . Not believe it ? he had asked . In contrast to his feelings at Christmas , Wittgenstein was not angry at his sister for saying this ; if anything , he was faintly intrigued . How could he not believe his father was gone ? he asked . For weeks , he had watched him waste into a long , dangling ash , eaten up with cancer . As it happened , he was the only one present when the old man finally died . All that night the dying man had held on , until his family was wrung out with blear weariness . At last there was only Wittgenstein , sitting on a chair beside his father 's bed . It was he who went downstairs to tell themp222it was over , and it was he who then led his mother to the sickroom to see , as it were , what had formed or transformed in that bed , the residue of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how his mother dreaded what she would find . Why ? he wanted to ask . She had already seen the worst . In the space of three months , she had watched her robust husband age thirty years . Why this dread ? What was to fear ? A few minutes later , when his siblings returned and they all stood mutely by the bed , he found himself wondering what had come over him during those last few minutes . Physically he was standing in the same room as his family , but otherwise he was not part of their world at all . He was forgivenand free , as was his father . Loss there was , but to his surprise there was no longer heat , nor spite , nor anger . What was sorrow ? Where did sorrow go after the last spent fumes of a soul ? Looking down at his father 's wrecked , still warm body , he saw only that a dying man 's sufferingwas over . Was he to be sorry for this ? The morning sun was on the sill . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and finally expelled from his own corrupting body . Sorrow ? Was that the word for this ? No , he thought , the dead do n't need the alms of our sorrow . If he was sorry for anyone now , it was for his mother . Frau Wittgenstein gazed helplessly at her children , and then , seeming to think she must say or do something , she suddenly squealed , I ca n't  --  and covered her mouth with her balled-up handkerchief , ashamed at her outburst . This upset Mining , who clutched her mother and started weeping . The others  --  Gretl , Paul and Kurt  --  were distinctly uncomfortable with this scene , which only made them more uneasy about their own contradictory feelings , caught somewhere between good-bye and good riddance . As through a glass , Wittgenstein could see their grief in all its guises and shades , its manifold traps . Miserable , guilty , ambivalent , Gretl looked at him as if to say , And what are you so pleased about ? How was he to explain happiness coincidental with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How to account for this desire to venture out into the free air to watch the light pour like sand through his fingers ? An hour before , a debt had been forgiven . The golem had been newly charteredinto a whole man . But he could n't rightfully say this  --  it would seem crazy , fishy . And not seem , either . From Gretl 's expression , he could see his behavior did seem crazy , but inwardly he was still beaming and did not care . The preceding two months had not been easy . From the day Wittgenstein had arrived home , there had been a subtlep223competition over the sick man , a competition moreover that was largely the sick man 's doing . Mining had been the one to care for him , but as his condition grew more severe and compromising , Karl Wittgenstein personallyhired two nurses , heavy Slavic women with smooth , dark skin and tightly rolled black hair . Ostensibly , he did this so as not to overburdenhis wife and children , yet it also gave him a heightened sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family as well . He would not be hostage to his family 's good graces . He would remain a sovereign state , with the nurses acting as a buffer between them . This almost immediately created bad feelings , especially as the nurses appropriated the sick man as their patient , dictating , under the broader fiats of his doctors , meals , sleep schedules , visits . It was uncanny how the nurses would joke , wheedle and even boss him about once the door was closed . Karl Wittgenstein seemed to thrive on it . In the midst of his sicknessand his growing helplessness , the two fleshy nurses pampered him in a way he never would have tolerated from Mining or even his wife , who one morning tearfully referred to them as those prostitutes . In dictatingand enforcing visiting hours , the two nurses also fell into friction with the servants , especially with Herr Stolz , Karl Wittgenstein 's personal butler of thirty-four years . The nurses even angered that most unlikely nurse of all , Gretl . Every afternoon , Gretl would bring fresh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would emerge from her car with all the grim vivacity of one on her way to a pressing business appointment . Freud might have lessened Gretl 's anger and anxiety , but he needed to do nothing about her psyche , which floated over life like a fulldraftedship , always managing to displace more pain than it carried . Nevertheless , this impending death was a constant drain on her , and she was absolutely furious when the older nurse told her one day that she would have to leave . Can you imagine ? she told Wittgenstein . Asking his own daughter to leave ! And in that tone ! I looked at Father , but of course he just lay there , letting that idiotic what's-her-name speak for him . And I thought , You 're even managing your own death , are n't you ? Even now you must wrest control , must n't you ? But it was easier for Karl Wittgenstein to let strangers do these things , and like many invalids , he took a secret , crafty pleasure in being willful and unpredictable , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lose him . The old man did not easily surrender to fatality . Painful as it was for him to move , he still insisted , in those first weeks Wittgenstein was home , on sitting at the head of the supper table . Careful ... careful , he would hiss as two young footmen carried him down the stairs , placing hint in his carved chair , then wedging him in with an elaborate assem/blage of pillows . Propped up there , valiantly eating his own bland and pitiful portion , he looked like a pasha , albeit a rapidly thinning one , bundledin his smoking jacket and muffler . With his gray hair oiled and combed and his muttonchops carefully trimmed and scented , the old man looked more fastidious than ever , thanks to these two hirelings , as Miningcalled his nurses . And still , greedily , the sick man licked the delicious dew off those last leaves that life held out to him . After dinner , following a sponge bath and massage , the nurses would help him onto the oval settee where , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hugging it to him like a woman as he coaxed forth those last nocturnal groans . More than ever now , Karl Wittgenstein 's home was a factory in which his children took their shifts . Kurt would sometimes play several rubbers of bridge with the old man , who took great pleasure in beating him . Paul 's job was to play the piano downstairs , letting the music rise like a draught up the grand stairway into his father 's open chambers . At first his father might clap weakly . Later , he would send a footman down to convey his compliments  --  or , just as likely , to present a piece of criticism scrawled on a sheet . As time progressed , though , Paul was asked to play shorter and shorter pieces . Playing along , Paul would see a handkerchief waft past his eyes . And looking upstairs he would see the nurse who had dropped it as a sign to stop : the old man was asleep . As his favorite , Mining took up much of her father 's available day . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corner of his father 's room was a gramophone with a trumpeting brass bell , with stacks of records heavy as plates on the table beside it . In the afternoon , after opening the curtains to let the sun beam across the Oriental carpets , Wittgenstein would often crank up the gramophone and play several records for his father . Caruso singing Puccini , Beethoven performed by the Berlin Philharmonic  --  his father listened and never said a word , careful not to betray the emotion that surely surged within him when he heard great music . Peeping out with those bulgy , watery eyes , the old man rather showed tremendous , cultivated attention , stoical and aloof . Still , Wittgensteinnoticed how , when he thought his son was n't watching , the sick man would tightly shut his eyes , almost shuddering at moments of exceptionalbeauty . Yet if Wittgenstein ventured to praise a passage later , his father would cut him short , saying , Yes , it was excellent . Very nice . Very nice , indeed . But Wittgenstein and his brothers felt another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old man 's solicitors reported to him on the plans he had set in motion to sell all his interests in the Wittgen/stein Gruppe . For Kurt , who was titularly in charge of one factory , this was in effect a vote of no confidence  --  why , his future was n't even a matter of serious question . Certainly Kurt did n't question it , his own confidence having eroded to the point where he grudgingly agreed with his father 's estimation of him . Had Wittgenstein and Paul shown any desire to assume control of their father 's enterprises , it might have been a different story . That developmentshad passed that point  --  not to mention the fact that neither wanted a business career  --  did not make them feel any easier about what Karl Wittgenstein no doubt saw as a repudiation of his life and values . Talking together in the study one afternoon , Wittgenstein and Paul recalled one summer nine years before when their father had attempted to introduce them to the business life . This was the summer following their brother Hans 's suicide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same disturbing signs . Kurt , if unpromising , was at least stable : he was working under the stern eye of Herr Graben , one of his father 's top assistants . With Kurt in tow and Rudi a losing cause , a worried Karl Wittgenstein instead focused his attention on his two youngest sons , Ludwig and Paul . Wittgenstein and Paul were then fifteen and sixteen , respectively  --  old enough , their father said , to learn about the affairs of the world , meaning , of course , the business world . With this in mind , Herr Wittgenstein took them on a tour of his factories in lower Bohemia . From the start , Wittgenstein felt it was hateful , two princes who had never done a day 's work being trotted through plants to watch other men toil . And fearsome toil it was , too , ladling liquid fire and beating red-hot ingots under a burning pall of poisonous yellow smoke . Karl Wittgenstein would question and reward only his very best workers , and he was carefully advised beforehand as to who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to explain his lathing to me , the Direktor himself , Karl Wittgenstein told his sons . And for him to see that I thoroughly understand his problems and cares , as if I wore the same greasy black apron . Or for the soot-faced forge operator to shake the factory owner 's hand  --  why , for him this is as if God visited hell . Wittgenstein best remembered the first plant on their tour , a machine shop in the vast Teplitz works , which made special steel castings for the Imperial-Royal military . At his father 's entrance , with the nervous plant manager hurrying before him , the grinding , banging and shrieking of the iron-girdered shop abruptly ceased . Wittgenstein could still remember the feel ( If the floor , slick with a heavy black coating of grease , carbonizedp226steel and curled lathe filings . Shrouds of yellowy sunlight filtered through the grimy skylights , trickling over the chain hoists and massive geared winches onto the hairy shoulders of the men , all heavily muscled as draft horses as they stood hobbled by their lathes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and charming  --  the two boys saw the awed , admiring looks of the workers as he walked down the line , more than a man , someone actually clean , bespeaking rectitude and prosperity in a suit that his butler , who accompanied him on all his travels , had zealously pressed and brushed that morning . Of the hundred and fifty men in that shop , Karl Wittgenstein personally complimented just four , the shop 's top producers . The chosen men were moved beyond words  --  moved almost to tears , several of them  --  as the Direktor stopped in the stream of his busy life and told the whole shop , in his gruff and barreling voice , how much , and precisely why , he valued this man , whom he called by name as he seized his grimy hand . This done , the Direktor gave a hortatory speech , emphasizing the importance of their work to the empire . And when the speech ended , they were at first unsure , afraid to applaud . But then with a stutter it started , clapping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the grinding , banging and shrieking that continued for two ten-hour shifts , six days a week . They went through one more plant that morning , and another that afternoon . But at one factory Karl Wittgenstein told his sons to wait outside the foreman 's office , saying ruefully , I have to speak to several individuals . From the long bench where they sat , his sons could hear his voice , bunking , guttural . The tempo was all too familiar , and as they sat ashen on that bench , three men and then a fourth hurried through the door with ruined faces . Stripped of their aprons under the gaze of a guard , they were summarily given their pay and their belongings . It was not by accident that the sons witnessed this . Wittgenstein could well remember his father 's charged expression , his active eyes , when he returned to bundle the two novitiates inside . And before it seemed they were even through that door , they could see their father 's aspect change like the sun . Looking back genially , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same story , with variations of course . The sick wife and the children , the sore back , the bottle that calls to them . Believe me , I have heard them all . Look , he said under his breath , with a glance at the workers who were working harder than ever now , with the killing done . Look at these fine men . Do you suppose for a second they are angry at me for this ? Angry ? For sacking the slacker , the drunk who might get them maimed or killed ? I did these men a service . Sad and unpleasant business to be sure ,  |p227but  one can not delegate everything . Sometimes to clear the air , I must see to this personally . Men respect this in a leader . It is not enough to hand out awards . They must see your face . They must see it in both guises . Karl Wittgenstein 's fate was certain . Less certain was his youngest son 's . In those last weeks , Wittgenstein increasingly felt the force of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would feel that questioninglook like a burning handprint on the side of his face . They both knew the question : What will you do with your life ? Karl Wittgenstein made various feints at asking this question . After dozing off during their concert one afternoon , the old man awoke to find his son at his bedside , making those peculiar logical notations in his notebook . Blinking with irritation , the father asked : Tell me , what does all that business mean ? What ? asked Wittgenstein , offering him the scrawled page . These symbols ? His father nodded . Any of it . Do you really want to know ? Yes . Please explain it to me . So against his better judgment Wittgenstein explained . His discussion of logical symbology was basic and down to earth , but his father grew increasingly agitated . Yet whenever Wittgenstein tried to end the lesson , the old man insisted that he continue , apparently in the hope that his son would hear his own foolishness . But finally , looking up , Wittgenstein saw that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'm sorry , gasped his father with a heave of his chest . I did not mean to say this  --  honestly , I did n't  --  but I do not see what relevance this has to anything , or  --  With a sudden wince of pain then , he hissed , Leave me now  --  go ! He pressed his hand over his face , his voice frantic , and there came a sharp smell . Please ! I ca n't continue this now ! Do n't you hear me ? I said , Call the nurse ! Call her , will you  --  The sick man did not have to call the nurse again . A moment later he was covered with comforting flesh , and Wittgenstein was hurrying down the long hallway , mortified at the coddling way the nurse spoke to his proud father , whom he could hear crying . Gretl fared no better . For her there was also this criticism , as powerful as it was unspoken . Even now , and ever so subtly , they were still quarreling . Yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  by outliving him she would win , for all the good that winning would do.  |p228Her  father could see she was winning . She always dressed especially smartly when she came to visit him , the better to remind the sick man of their now vastly differing status . A black dress with bottle-green panels . A veiled hat with a brace of pheasant quills fastened by a diamond signet . With each subsequent visit , Gretl seemed to outdo herself , the better to show herself as one of the secular world of the living , while he , succumbingto his own dark medicine , was fast slipping into that black tarn of his own belatedness , soon to be a face sunk beneath the earth , unheededand forgotten . Yet neither won . With a look , the father could undo months of her work with Freud . Several times Wittgenstein found his sister quietly crying downstairs  --  crying , she said , because she was so appalled at the persistence and virulence of her anger , the way it sunk only deeper without ever emerging into anything else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sister he kept it hidden , even to himself . However buried or transmogrified , though , it sometimes would emerge , as one day when he impulsively told her : I just want to ask him once , What would you have me do with my life ? But why ? she asked . He 'll never tell you . Ca n't you see that ? He 'd only be relinquishing his advantage . Yes , but at least I would have asked . Gretl sat there staring at him . But if he refuses to answer , what 's the point of asking ? I do n't know . His hands were inert . I suppose so I could tell myself that I had asked . Gretl had good reason for advising him to let it go . She had put a big question to her father once . She and Wittgenstein both remembered her question . They also bitterly remembered his answer . Gretl 's question concerned Hans . After his death , four trunks containinghis belongings were shipped home from Cuba . Like the rest of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She also knew that those trunks probably contained the many letters her father had written Hans , especially in the last year before his banishment , when their relationship had degenerated into little more than an abusive exchange of notes thrust under closed bedroom doors late at night . Karl Wittgenstein was n't about to have his family burrowing through Hans 's trunks . He was n't even about to discuss them , or Hans , who for him was a closed book . Without a word to anyone , Karl Wittgenstein took possession of those trunks . Gretl thought he might even have had them burned.  |p229Gretl  found it maddening to have anything withheld from her . But it was more than mere sorrow or curiosity that drove her to ask her father about the trunks . It was revenge . Even at twenty-four , Gretl was exceptionallybold . She told Wittgenstein that she was going to ask her father . She even invited him to hide in the next room and listen . Wittgenstein begged her not to do it , but he was fascinated  --  fascinated and ashamed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to their father . He hated himself for being so meek and obedient . A queasy , silent thirteen , he felt like a bent nail that somebody had pried from a door as he positioned himself  --  quite against his principles  --  in the next room . As he had expected , Gretl 's initial request was quietly and firmly rebuffed . But Gretl would n't be brushed off like a fly . Insolently , she repeatedher request , whereupon Karl Wittgenstein took his first swipe at her , saying , Such concern , my daughter . When your poor brother was alive , you could hardly bear the sight of him . But now you want to pick his bones , do n't you . Gretl knew his strategy : he would infuriate her , then dismiss her as a hysterical woman . Calmly she replied , He was my brother . I 've a right to see his belongings . At this Karl Wittgenstein switched tack , adopting a more fatherly tone . Believe me , he reasoned , you do n't want to see these things . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . Still , I would like to better understand what happened to him . And I 'm telling you , he said , his voice rising a notch , you wo n't understand . Believe me , this business will do you no good . I can be the judge of that , she insisted . No ! he countered , smacking his hand on the end table . I 'll be the judge of that , and I 'll not stand here palavering with you any longer ! You have n't the least concern for your brother . You 're merely doing this to provoke me ! Just as you 've done all your life ! Thus began his tirade , his voice booming through the wall to the room where his son stood cowering . For a minute father and daughter traded accusations , and then there came a crash as Karl Wittgenstein knocked down a china lamp , raging , Get out ! Get out ! Thinking he heard his father coming then , the boy panicked and ran into the closet . Oh , that oozing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Hiding like a moth among these musty old clothes ! Like hammer blows came his father 's threats . And obstinately , insanely , came Gretl 's squealing accusations . Who do you think Hans was  --  your property ? Because you fathered him ? Is that it ? And the boy feeling he wouldp230pass out then , pinching his thigh in compensation because it was so blackly , murderously good . But if he was going to ask , Wittgenstein knew he would have to ask soon . Like a fire the cancer was running through the old man . One day the cello was too much , and then it was too excruciating to be moved to a chair , let alone down the stairs to supper . His weight dropped , his skin loosened , his cheeks caved in and his eyes darkened , taking on that glassy , half-expectant look of death . Then came morphine injections , and then the day Wittgenstein heard his father scream , the cancer having so eroded his bones that he had to be moved an inch at a time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Wittgenstein did ask , but by then it was too late . He knew it was unfair  --  perhaps even cowardly  --  to weigh his father down with such questions , but his anxiety was too strong . He had to know . Please , he asked suddenly one morning , in no apparent context . Just tell me . If it were up to you , what would you have me do with my life ? Gazing up at him , the old man wheezed , What can you possibly mean , asking me this ? I mean with my life . I want to know finally . If it were up to you , what would you have me do with it ? His father looked one hundred . He looked vaguely like a monkey , a ravaged snow monkey . The old man stared up , uncomprehending . Can you just answer me that ? prompted the son in that cheery , overly loud voice with which people address children and convalescents . Obviously , you have some idea . I just wanted to know . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to know . The father still had all his faculties , but this was not sinking in , or not as the son intended . His breath faintly popped and whistled through his clogged nostrils , filling the room with a fetor that clung to one 's clothes . Feeling frantic , Wittgenstein wished then that he had n't asked , realizing his utter stupidity as he croaked : That was all . What would you have me do ? That 's all I 'm asking . Tears sprang up in his father 's eyes and ran down his cheeks . Not kindly tears . Tears of rage . With a pop of phlegm , he erupted into a rasping gargle , a drowning , underwater voice : I . . . do n't ... know !  --  Why do you even ask ?  --  And after ignoring me for years ! What do you expect , you jackass  --  my blessing ? It was all out then . With a jolt of pain , the old man irrationally demanded , What are you doing here ? What ?  |p231I  'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  and he stopped , suppressing a hiccupping breath . Trying again , he said , I only came to ask , to ask ! But then he stopped again , staring at his father before he added with another hiccup , About what I ought to do .. . Do ? His father 's lower lip was jutting out with simian rage . He spat acid , demanding in that gargling voice , But why ask me ? You 're a philooooosopher , are n't you ? Wittgenstein just stood there stupidly . Then one of the nurses burst in , and he whirled around on her . Get out ! But Herr Wittgenstein  --  I said get out ! Something tore loose in him then . Turning back to the bed , he peered down at his father . Is this the best answer you can give ? he said . An insult ? A sincere question , and this is your response ? His father was trembling . No words were left , only squeaks . And then came rage-hot tears as the old man gasped , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is that what you want to hear ? Huu-it is n't e-nough to die  --  I must , I must tell my children what they want to . . . huu-hear . So I can be hug-nored , God !  --  His voice broke off , and Wittgenstein could almost hear the crack of bone as he began again . Huu-I . . . do n't . . . care . Do-you-hearthat , philosopher ? Then came another crack of bone , a squirt of tears . Do n't care . . . and do n't know ! Why ? asked the son , bending down . It was a whiff of a word . Before him then his father 's face crumbled like a fire into ashes . Gone was the imploring boy . Wittgenstein stared clear down into his father 's squirty eyes as he asked again : Why ? And the old man , sucking air , said , Huu-I . . . told . . . you .. . Wittgenstein did not know himself then , as he hung over his father 's smelly bed or bier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clearly his stolen nose , that phantom appendage that had been dangled before his eyes all these years . Nodding , the son said softly , You just now spoke the truth , did n't you ? Not only do n't you know but you never did , did you ? Thank you . In spite of yourself , you have answered my question . And without another word , he left . Karl Wittgenstein died four days later . There were no confessions or tearful good-byes , no parting tales or hortatory advice , no last requests . For Wittgenstein , there was nothingp232more to say . Looking down at his dying father , he was reminded of a scuttled ship glugging down into the oily , smothering darkness , swallowingup its own confounded history . His father 's leviathan of a life was sucking down its own perished past and even taking theirs with it , leavingonly bubbles , empty , evanescent and unreadable . It began as a sloppy , ambiguous death , with no good prospects but an end to suffering . What was the dying man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mining and his wife . Wittgenstein , too , had kissed his fathergood-bye . And later , quite unexpectedly , in his bath , the son found himself crying like a little boy as the warm water gurgled out the tap , sobbing for his cold words to his father , which would stand like the stars . There was nothing to do then but wait . It was wearying and boring , it dragged on and on . In the aftermath of their quarrel , Wittgenstein had given up fighting his anger and was filled with a bitterness sour as hell fumes . His limbs ached with his own poison . Throughout the night , his father hung on obstinately , from spite or habit , refusing to be dislodged . And finally Wittgenstein reached that point just short of sleep in which he was not thinking , judging or wishing . For all he saw now , his dying father might have been a fly on the wall . His father 's face was the very face of Nature , which is always abrading into being , forever unfolding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unfolding , his father 's ashen face slowly began to change . Gradually Wittgenstein began to discern a slow transformation in his father 's expression . It was the grip of pleasure , a fatal , vivid pleasure that the dying man hugged to himself like the amplecurve of his cello . He was not a father anymore . He was released from this life and this family , severed from his frailties and failures , pried loose from the vise of this life and free now to be nothing . There , Wittgenstein told him in his mind . It is enough . It is all right now . It is time . Go . You are forgiven . Please , for God 's sake , go now while it 's all right .. . But the old man only hung on , he hung on and on . Just when the family would think he was gone , he would half open his eyes , asking for a little water as if he had forgotten to take enough for where he was going . Why this delaying ? His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or family . He was ready to take leave of them and they of him , yet he hung on , and grimly they hung on , obstinate in their obligation , not wanting to miss his end . But he would n't quit . Relentlessly , he wore them down , and by five in the morning he had them beaten , as ache and restlessnessset in and heads began to droop . The dying man had his way in the end . Poldy said she must have somep233air , and Mining followed her out . Then Kurt looked at Paul , suggestively tapping his cigarette case . Then they were gone and , with a sigh , Gretl left as well , sneaking out as from a play that had begun to bore her . What possessed him to remain ? Wittgenstein would wonder later . Why did he not tell them of this sense he had that they were going to miss the end ? For perhaps a minute Wittgenstein had been staring at his father when the eyes half opened and gave a squirt . And then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had lingered there in wonder , sorrow and homage . Neither he nor his father moved . For a long moment they looked at each other , both asking and granting forgiveness  --  the simple grace to leave . And then without any sign from his father , Wittgenstein instinctively knew it was time : the old man wanted him to leave the room so he could die . Not a word was spoken , not a word was necessary . Without a look back , Wittgenstein stepped outside and shut the door . He waited only a minute , and he was not wrong . Peering up at the ceiling , he knew precisely when his father died . Up , as through his own head , swept his father 's soul . Up in one hot gust it went , like a flame sucked up a flue . Wittgenstein sometimes thought he must be deluded , to believe that his vile old self had died with his father . He thought he must be doubly deluded to imagine that this condition could be permanent . Yet even now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His old fear of open space ? Over his head hundreds of miles and below perhaps as many fathoms . What need had he of boat or shelter ? Sound body . Watertight soul . Sufficientmind . Red light . Red cow . Red Wittgenstein . And staring down at the red water of Sognefjord , his mind said , Look down into it , into the uncertain depths of the world . He saw the bloodredsurface of the water and upon the water were golden flecks of fire . But look down deeper , he told himself , and to his fear he saw that he could . But to look deeper still , he saw he must jettison fear also . And he told himself then that if he truly had no fear he would take off his clothes , and he did . And he told himself he could dive in and the undersky would not be too wide , nor the red water too deep or cold or salty . And there would be no one to see him naked , and what did he care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this , and this only ? And thinking of his father 's passing , he saw his new life dangling like a shadow in the water , sliding beneath the fire and depths , saying , Come merge with me . You can not walk m the water , man , but you can dive , and dive deep . Andp234then he was standing shivering and naked on the side of the Sweimfoss , smirking because for all the solemnity of this moment , it was so infernallysilly and  --  Whoosh  --  Down he dove with open eyes , down into the cold depths that were red with fire , then black with throbbing pressure . And as his ears popped , he struggled still deeper into the pressure and silence of that aorta , the pulsing heart of the world , hot with the blood of new life and sorrows aching to be dislodged into being . And then the same voice said , Enough , and he floated up , his lungs burning and his legs faintly fluttering , watching his own flattened bubbles wobble up toward the surface , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . With a gasp , he broke the surface . Splashing in the air and red light , he was back again , and it was cold ! And what a holy ass he was as he shinnied up the rope , grasped the raspy wooden sides and bellied over the gunwale . Splattering water and jibbering then , he saw the cow 's broad , inquisitive face . Watching over her nest of hay , she seemed to say , You are daft , Wittgenstein , but in his mind he laughingly replied , But you misunderstand . I am just very , very happy . When Love Was Still GreenA YEAR LATER , in late June of 1914 , Wittgenstein was waiting on the pier in Heyanger , a town on Sognefjord where he had spent the winter , when Moore arrived on the Sweimfoss . Dressed in a checked flannel shirt , heavy hiking boots and a brown Mountie 's hat , Moore looked , after a year of marriage , softer and heavier , as full and plumb as a ripe apple . The brim of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he pushed it back to get a better view of Wittgenstein , who , after a year of semi-solitude , was himself a changed , if not semi-estranged creature , vaguely feral in the eyes . Gone were the shined shoes and tie , the aesthetical reserve . Tanned and smiling , wearing rough moleskin pants , an ill-fitting woolen workshirt and lumberboots , he looked a bit wild , his wiry hair as shaggy as a roan bull who 'd been butting his head against a fence post . Ho ! cried Moore , cupping his hands over his mouth as the thudding boat eased into the slip . Do n't you look fit !  |p235Much  as he tried to appear hearty and cheerful , Moore was sorely relieved to be getting off this rust bucket after four rough days . From the moment he stepped on the dock , Moore was pouring out his woes , beginning with the day he spent seasick in his berth , clutching the swill pail the mate had tucked in beside him . Scratching , Moore was saying : And we had the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thick black sheets of it  --  for two days ! I did n't know you could get seasick on a fjord ; I never dreamt it was possible . As an afterthought , Moore shook Wittgenstein 's hand . But you brought with you so much , said Wittgenstein later , when he saw Moore 's mound of luggage assembled on the dock . Never will we get this all up the mountain . Well , huffed Moore , rocking on his heels . I 've read that you have no idea up north , what with the vicissitudes of weather . I assure you , you will have enough , said Wittgenstein a bit ominously . Some of it we must leave . It is too late to set out today . Tomorrow , yes . Tonight , I have made for us reservations at the Hotel Flaam . Oh , good , said Moore , who frankly was hoping they might spend three or four days more in this pretty town . And then , as they were going to their hotel , Moore dropped a broad hint . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shook his head noncommittally . In a flurry , Moore continued , Yes , it takes a while to settle in . A new country and all . And about mail ? Do you suppose a letter to Dorothy would get back to her in one week 's time ? Impossible . Two weeks , perhaps . Two weeks ! Oh , but she 'll be very worried . Then Moore had another alarming thought : And our mail ? A shrug . They will hold it here for us . You mean we shall get nothing ? Attempting to strike a more hopeful note , Wittgenstein said , If we ride in , we will get it , yes . Oh . Moore looked at him hopefully . It 's not too terribly far , then ? Fifteen kilometers . Wittgenstein 's eyes rolled up into his head . In the mountains it is hard to tell . Oh , well , on horseback , scoffed Moore , without the faintest idea what that meant . So it 's not too far . Over mountains it is far . Wittgenstein @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least . Oh , . said Moore nonchalantly . But inwardly he said , Good heavens !  |p236This  was n't the holiday Moore had planned , not at all . Not that he had n't tried to wriggle out of it ; the wretched truth was , he was trapped . Originally , Moore and Pinsent were to have made the journey together , but then Moore saw he would have to leave earlier than they 'd planned , while Pinsent reluctantly decided to leave later as a concession to his mother , who had come down with a serious case of bronchitis . As it turned out , Moore and Pinsent would pass in Bergen , where they planned to meet one night for a changing of the guard , as Moore put it . But this was a fortnight away , and Moore first had some business to transact . As a favor to Russell  --  now at Harvard delivering his new lecture series , Our Knowledge of the External World  --  Moore had agreed to take down Wittgenstein 's dictated ideas , the culmination of his labors for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own ideas ? Moore had asked when Russellfirst approached him about it . I rather envisioned it as a holiday . Smiling , Russell tried to formulate an answer , then gave up . No , said Russell with a dry smile . Wittgenstein ca n't transcribe his ownideas . That , you see , would be writing . But you said he keeps a notebook . Moore was beginning to color . He ca n't copy it out ? Russell 's smile slithered . Well , clearly he ca n't . Call it anxiety , if you like  --  you know what a perfectionist he is . He is not ready to publish , not even near , but fortunately he finds speech acceptable  --  easier , I suppose , to repudiate . I 've tried letters , but it 's tortuous . No matter what he says , it changes  --  the ground is constantly shifting under your feet . But really , emphasized Russell , he 's quite enthusiastic about the idea of dictating . And obviously you are , shall we say , the perfect medium . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mere stenographer , and you 're  --  well , basically neutral on the subject . Certainly less suspect than I am , anyway . Then Moore started squirming . Oh , I do n't know , he said , thoughtfully touching the tip of his nose . I 'd sooner snatch bait from a trap . After another moment 's loss , Moore recovered enough to say , But I 'm afraid I still do n't understand . Why ca n't you go yourself ? Well , I would very much like to , said Russell , hovering himself for a moment . But you see it will be at least January before I can , what with this American excursion . And by then Wittgenstein may not agree . And besides , he said , brightening  --  and here was the clincher  --  Pinsent will be there with you , wo n't he ? Moore still could not believe he had been stupid enough to agree to it  --  especially without Pinsent there as a buffer . Already , Moore felt weary ,  |p237a|p|pearing  to believe  --  to Wittgenstein 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Finally , after a drab supper that first night , Moore asked Wittgenstein if they might stay a while longer at the Flaam . Three or four days more , perhaps ? Curled around his pipe , with a humbled look , he confessed , I would enjoy a little , em , transitional civilization . I 've got blisters from these new boots . And as for a horse , well , frankly , my piles have been acting up . Moore stuffed his pipe drearily . I suppose you must think I 'm a bit of a duffer . Straining to be conciliatory , Wittgenstein said , A few more days we can wait if you like . Moore brightened . You would n't mind ? Actually , I thought you could do your dictating here . We could , said Wittgenstein dubiously . Several days ? Moore pressed , hopeful . You think your dictating may take that long ? Wittgenstein grew tense . I do not know . I have no idea . I am unhappy with the whole scheme . Moore 's spruce chair gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on it . Anxious to part with my thoughts ? Wittgenstein was stunned . Not anxious , no . And not even very willing , it seemed to Moore : tenacious was the word for it . Over two tense days , with Moore acting as midwife , Wittgenstein grudgingly brought forth a year 's worth of thinking . Wittgenstein said , for one , that so-called logical properties show the logical properties of language and therefore the universe , but they say nothing . He said that in philosophy there are no deductions ; that philosophyis purely descriptive . Distrust of grammar , he said , is the first prerequisitefor philosophizing . But the swipes he took at Russell led Moore to ask slyly if the second prerequisite was n't distrust of Russell . On the contrary , said Wittgenstein acerbically . Distrust of oneself is second . Russell is third . Then comes you , Moore . Such moments of levity were few . Wittgenstein 's prickliness wore on Moore . No sooner would Moore read something back , it seemed , than Wittgenstein would correct him . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ met with impatience ; and if Moore raised an objection , or requiredtoo much clarification , Wittgenstein would jump up , shouting : This is a stupid idea ! Idiotic ! I hate it , I hate it ! Do n't rage at me ! Shaking the stem of his pipe . This was n't my idea . Rot ! Everything I say is rot ! Listen , Moore would say sternly . Sli.dl we proceed with this or not ?  |p238Whatever  do you mean ? A look of shock as Wittgenstein motioned him down with his hand . Now , as I said .. . By the time they finished three days later , they were both sour and exhausted . Moore felt as if somebody had been punching him in the ribs . But still , he was pleased with the results , even if he felt , as he wrote Dorothy , that he had played midwife to a rhinoceros . Wittgenstein was not so pleased , however . The dictator was sick . The next day as they loaded the horses , he was gloomy and silent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thief . With this chore over , Wittgenstein was more anxious than ever to return to the hut he had just built . Manual labor and solitude had been his cure that spring , and it was what he needed now . What he did not need was a guest . Oddly enough , the blessing Wittgenstein had felt after his father 's death had remained with him longer than he 'd expected . But it had crumpled under the supreme test  --  his obligatory visit home to Vienna at Christmas . Like Pinsent , Wittgenstein found himself having to contend with his widowed mother 's loneliness and endless worries about him , her worseninghealth and complaints . True to form , there had been yet another young lady for him to meet  --  another failure . And then from all quarters came the inevitable questions about why he insisted on leading this hermit'sexistence away from his family , in the middle of nowhere . There was also the matter of money  --  not the lack of money but the harrowing abundance of it heaping up , and with it hectoring solicitors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no avoiding it now . It was not his father 's money , or even his family 's money . No , it was his money , mounting , compounding , stock and dividend money with steel jaws to trap him if he was n't careful . From all this he had fled , leaving Vienna in mid-January . Once back in Norway , he was better . It was nice to burrow in under the relentless winter  --  short gasps of daylight followed by endless nights , pulsing with the gaseous whorls of the borealis . Across virgin snows , in applecracking cold , he learned to snowshoe and ski . Several times , he was even seen in church . His was not a hermit 's existence . He was staying in the home of the town postmaster , along with his wife and four children . The postmaster was amazed at the quantity of important-looking mail the boarder received , and it quickly became known that the Austrian was a man ofp239means who struck a bargain without haggling as he went about buying tools and supplies for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with gorgeous graying blond hair , saw all this and more in her boarder . She spoke some German and was in the process of teaching him Norwegian . Sitting across from him in a chair , tutoring him , she was like a mother bird stuffing new phrases down his hungry gullet , saying Det er virkeligsnilt av Dem .. . **28;14981;TOOLONG . . . Leaning closer then , she would clarify the grammar , show him the proper position of the tongue , clucking and squirming with delight as he struggled to improve his pronunciation . Norwegian he acquired with remarkable ease ; it was his tutor 's more subtle tongue that was slow to discern . But then one day , hearing her full skirts swish behind him , he looked down to see her plump hand sluice through the fold between his shirt buttons . When he grasped her hand , she mistook it for passion , emitting a low midwinter moan . How fearful he found her , bristling with an aurora of sticky , staticky sex . His Norwegianwas not bad ; he made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disbelief that he had nothing for her , the postmaster 's wife gave him a real Norwegian lesson then  --  it was a tongue lashing he would be months getting over . What was wrong with him ? she asked . He did not go to the socials that made these winters bearable . He did not talk to the young ladies . Why do you withhold yourself ? she asked . For whom ? For what ? Sunk in his room later , unable to answer any of her questions , he felt only his own shameful incapacity and contradiction . Much as he wanted to leave , he saw he must stay , since to leave in midwinter would only have invited suspicions . For two tense months he remained there . Loomingand unavoidable , smoldering still , the wife made him suffer for havingspurned her . At times , he thought he could almost smell her , musty as a sickroom quilt in need of airing . Spring had saved him . It was a mighty , thunderous spring , which came first with a dripping , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and boughs shook loose their burdens . Then in April , with a squeaking and groaning like a nail being wrenched from a board , the ice-bound lakes broke open , the white-hot ice booming and splitting like the surface of a vast , aboriginal egg . Later that- month , driving a heavily loaded sledge drawn by a bay plow horse named Oskar , Wittgenstein set off for the land he had bought the previous fall . Waterfalls unfroze and crashed down the mountainsides.  |p240Under  that concerted sun , hardy wildflowers popped up through the melting snow , and the lakes broke clear , flashing up with a hard , blue radiance . With a smack of leather and tinkle of harness chains , Oskar swung a head the size of a woodstove , his flanks and shoulders quivering to dislodge the first black flies . Wittgenstein cracked the reins and up the hill they climbed , the wet , dark earth ripping and squirting out under the sledge 's runners with the smell of ripe cheese . With a neighbor named Nordstrom and his two sons , Wittgenstein had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lumber arrived on the fjord a few miles below . For two brutal months he drove himself . It took those weeks of hard physical labor just to break his will 's dark hold , his pride still welted with the wife 's words . But the work redeemed him , his fears melting again in the mountain plenum . In fact , he was quite good until Moore arrived  --  in his mind , it was Moore 's visit that spoiled things . Having surrendered his ideas to Moore , Wittgenstein felt denuded , without an ounce of fat to get him through this next long winter . Wittgenstein knew , at heart , that this was n't Moore 's fault . But still he resented Moore 's intruding presence , and he was sick of Moore 's complaints . As they rode out to the hut , Moore 's piles throbbed so badly that he hardly knew whether to walk or ride , and so the ten-hour trip stretched into twelve . By the time they arrived , Moore was done in . Spottingthe " necessary house , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with that delicate , bowlegged dance step  --  the green apple two-step , some call it . Why ? Moore asked himself as he crouched over that fulsome lime pit , grunting and slapping . Why was he here and not with his young wife ? Why not at the Hurley-Burley , where he and Dorothy had passed an idyllicAugust at the seaside the previous summer ? It was not long after their wedding that Dorothy had insisted on taking him there for a needed rest . This came after Moore had begun to founder on Prolegomena to Any Future Certainty , a paper he had been months struggling with . Ironically , it was Wittgenstein who had suggested the topic that day in Moore 's office when he refused to say there was not a rhinoceros in the room . Moore 's paper sought to respond to such skepticism , but how ? The further Moore progressed , the more stale and unconvincinghe found his arguments . For a month Dorothy watched his mounting frustration , until at supper one night Moore threw up his hands and declared : I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know there are at least two things in the world !  |p241I  see , said Dorothy quietly . I 'll show you a third . You 're exhausted , and I 'm exhausted by you . I insist we take a holiday . Moore did n't protest very hard . Indeed , he was thoroughly relieved three days later when they registered at the Hurley-Burley , a tall , whiteshingledhotel near Harwich , on a cliff overlooking the North Sea . There was a crowd of regulars who convened there every summer , older and middle-aged couples , with many children . Dorothy was among the youngest wives , and when she revealed to Mrs. Noyes that they were only recently married , they were then known as the " young couple "  --  mascots to remind the older people of when their love was green . There 's rather more burley than hurley here , mused old Mr. Colbeck while sitting beside Moore at grogtime , which began promptly at four on the promontory overlooking the sun-greased sea . By the second day , Moore had heard that dictum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Puffins  --  the return guests for whom the sameness of those placid Augusts was clearly the best that life could hold . It was an easy , unmeditated life , a thoroughly common life among ordinarypeople . Yet Moore had to admit that the life here promised much more good , and certainly a good deal less harm , than many more rigorouslyapplied systems . After supper in the dining room , there were the usual round of skits , impromptu musicales and parlor games . Moore played charades and , with Dorothy at the piano , sang the definitive , three-hankie rendition of Foggy , Foggy Dew . Wearing a mop wig and a seaweed beard , he even posed as Poseidon at the Henleys ' fortieth weddinganniversary party . Moore guessed it was partly due to being married and partly due to age that he suddenly found these humble rites so sacred and consoling . Sitting with the men , he could avidly discuss pigeon breeding , garden pests or dog training . There were an endless variety of things to talk about , and once it was learned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authority on virtually every topic . At night , there was always a large gathering out on the promontory . Mr. Glencannon , who only a year ago had lost his lovely wife , Agnes , would play Mother 0 ' Mine and Comin ' thro ' the Rye on his mournful bagpipes ( sounding like a frightful geese gaggle , as old Mrs. Dovecote never failed to remark ) . Wearing heavy Shetland sweaters and bundled under blankets in the varnishedslat chairs , they would sit for three and four hours at a stretch , talking , drinking toddies , playing euchre . The awnings rippled and the waves pounded the black rocks , sending up a mist that kept people wipingtheir glasses . Puffing his pipe and holding hands with Dorothy , Moore would stare out to sea , hardly saying a word , while the others disagreedp242over which constellation was which , or gamely debated whether dogs have souls or God a sex  --  questions , ultimately , that were respectfully remanded to the able Professor Moore for his considered views . Mornings , Moore would be up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ savor the sun as it burned off the fog . At the breakfast bell he would be off , heading down the line of steaming chafing dishes , heaping his plate with rashers of bacon and shirred eggs , toast and stewed prunes . God , but he could pack it away there . He could feel the fragrant heat fanning up from the fiery gardens . He could smell the rank sea air that flapped the stiff white linen as he worked away at that holy mountain of food , conscious of the rising pressures of his body stoked with two normal-sizebreakfasts and four cups of hot coffee . Seven days a week this was Moore 's Sunday morning service . And the body  --  was it not a luxury liner built for pleasure as well as thinking ? Dorotheeee ? he would wheedle as he crept into the room . Dorotheeeeee . Oh , he 'd catch her in bed . And did n't he love the whiteness of her breasts below her sunburned neck ! Working down the whiteness of her thighs to the red flesh of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sniffing and snorting . Jackstamping in the joy seat of that squeaking iron bed . Long clam-sucking thrusts and a clenching kiss . Then came the whistling , the little rinse in the wash basin before changing into his scratchy black bathingcostume . Grinning at her in the mirror . Yes , a black pleasure ship he was , built for stateliness , not for speed . Offering his arm to Dorothy , Moore would cross the shaky planks that led down the cliffs to the beach . With his pipe clenched in his teeth and his skimmer slanted against the glare , he would step off onto the fine white sand so agreeably hot underfoot . A few older couples sitting fully dressed in beach chairs holding parasols ; and then the younger women in flouncy wading gowns and their husbands in banded black . Children running with their pails . Mrs. Marsdon 's sturdy black Labrador , Hero , bounding into the foam . Greetings came like alms . Ah , the young people . Mrs. Moore , do come sit here beside me . Good Mr. Moore ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Oh , very well , thank you ! Taking leave then of the Burleybacks and bumsitters , parting from his wife , Moore would calmly slog out into the cold , black water . And after him the children would shout , Mr. Moore , your hat ! You 're wearing your hat , sir ! Lazily waving his hand . The hat 's old . It floats . The waves will wash it ashore.  |p243Doing  a slow crawl beyond the waves , Moore would spurt and roll over . A sperm whale , he was . From the shore , his black belly resembled a distant island . Timid swimmers found his presence reassuring ; he made the sea look so restful and inviting , the golden straw of his skimmer glowing like a halo over the glassy roll . Moore felt distant and serene as he fluttered along , peering over his belly at the hotel on the little bluff and the folk lying on the sand . From here it seemed he could draw these disparate elements of his life into perspective ; it was a way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife , staring half in disbelief at that fragile green thing waiting for him on the shore . So odd , he would think , this need to see from afar what could best be seen up close . It was a matter of one 's emotional focal length : one was either near- or farsighted , or perhaps not clear at any distance . With his arms waggling at his sides , Moore would daily test the limits of his acuity , drifting out until he felt a kind of pain , like a boy seeing how long he could remain submerged . Sweeping out , he would wait until at last he saw her waving at him , angry that he always ventured out so far , without a care . Then he would bellow back and slog in , feeling secretly grateful that she had called him back . Floating out , he could reforge that bond , venturing forth that he might return , lobbing over the swells to strain the ragged edge of sight . And now , a year later , as Moore emerged from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mountaintop , he asked himself once again why he felt this need to swim out from his wife and new life ? What on earth had driven him here ? he wondered , inwardly cursing himself for being such a fool . For the first time ever in his life , Moore felt homesick  --  wifesick . This loneliness was a curious feeling . All his life he had prized male company , and he was strangely grieved now to see that he could never return to that life . In his youth , he had always thought he would travel  --  oh , not widely or adventurously , but freely , whether alone or in the company of other men , cloaked in his thoughts like a weatherproof . This notion was so bound up in his youth that it pained him to find that he was now a confirmed homebody . The question was how he would endure this isolationand wifesickness , not to mention another week of Wittgenstein . As for Wittgenstein , he was increasingly oppressed by Moore 's normality . Moore was the apotheosis of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world or woman . Inept as he was in the outdoors , Moore held firmly the bosom of life , snatching pleasure where he foundp244it . Yet despite these frictions , they had their pleasant times . There was still much work to do in the hut , and with Moore 's ham-handed help , Wittgenstein finished the bunks and built a shelter over the woodpile . They went for long walks and called over gorges to their cacaphonous echoes . In the sparkling fjord , they sailed a small sailboat Wittgenstein had bought , Moore sprawled in the stern , his boyish face turned up to the sun . But most of all , Moore loved to skinny-dip in gushing mountain streams . At the first sight of a stream or falls , he would be hopping on one foot , yanking off his trousers . Oh , come on , Wittgenstein ! he would taunt , slogging into a gorge filled with mist and sunlight . Here Moore was in his element . Here he was again a ripping pleasure boat , whooping as the icy water pounded his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand it . Gone was the grinning novitiate who had dived naked from the Sweimfoss . Ashamed and intimidated by Moore 's nakedness , Wittgenstein would retreat down the trail and wait until Moore reappeared , half dressed , with his hair awry . In the evenings before the stove , they read and talked . Frequently they argued about philosophy , but this was the least of their conflicts . Slowly , another competition was unfolding . Within a few days , their relationship began to take on a queer domestic quality , Wittgenstein acting the Spartanprovider and Moore the dependent complainer , inept with tools , horses , cooking . Moore resented Wittgenstein 's youth and vigor , his contempt for comfort . How could Wittgenstein silently endure this misery ? he wondered . Awful food ! Lonely nights ! No warm Dorothy to crawl up against ! Lying in his bunk at night , Moore would wait until his bladder was fit to burst . And then he would charge into the half darkness , there to flail and curse at the mosquitoes that flew like birdshot into his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had something over Wittgenstein . Twice he had gone with Wittgenstein to his neighbor Nordstrom 's to buy eggs and cheese and even fresh meat when it was available . Nordstrom had a daughter named Sigrid of perhaps eighteen years , willowy and blond but doorknob plain . Wittgenstein had seen her watching him , but he persistently ignored her . Not Moore . I saw her eyeing you , he joked as they rode back . You may take a wife yet if you do n't watch out . At this Wittgenstein recoiled , snapping , Do n't be silly ! Moore rolled his eyes , happy to get a rise out of him . Oh , you never know.  |p245Please   --  Wincing . Do n't speak foolishness . After the many small humiliations he had suffered , Moore liked getting Wittgenstein flustered . He dubbed Sigrid the Milkmaid , and after that , when they saw her in the meadows minding her cows , Moore would chime : Well , well . . . your Milkmaid has come to see you , Wittgenstein . Moore meant it as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , until one day he snapped : I forbid you to mention her again ! There was another incident that was to leave a lasting impression on Moore . On no account would Wittgenstein dress in front of him , but one morning , coming through the door , Moore caught him with his trousers down , adjusting a thick black belt that girded his groin and stomach . Glaring , Wittgenstein said in a brittle voice : I ruptured myself winter last . I must now wear this belt . Oh , said Moore , turning away . So sorry to hear that . For Moore , the image lingered , changed to a chastity belt  --  a hard , self-imposed privation . And then one night , almost in spite of himself , Moore asked : Do n't you find it awfully lonely up here ? Wittgenstein eyed him uneasily . Again , it was the postmaster 's wife , posing a question for which he had no answer . He replied : I am sorry you miss your wife . I am sure I can not imagine such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can not . Oh , it 's terrible ! volunteered Moore , grateful to hear a note of commiseration . Before I was married , I could n't have imagined missing anybody so much . It 's indescribable . But seeing Wittgenstein 's face , Moore realized that he had struck a barrier : there was no point pursuing it ; it was a thing beyond Wittgenstein'svisible spectrum . Donning a mosquito headnet and coat , Moore then ventured out into the red darkness , into the mild wind where the mosquitoes were singing . For years , Moore saw , intimacy had been his fear ; intimacy with a woman had been his girding belt . But now , standing atop that mountain , Moore saw that his darkest fear was loss of intimacy . Intimacy had given him new spectacles . Through love of a woman , he could see clear across the earth . But now Moore felt the stinging fear that his love might be sick or in need , perhaps dead . Stop it ! he ordered himself . ' Fear of loss was understandable , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fear of happiness was far the stranger . Fear of happiness , in part , was what had possessed him to float out to sea , and it was just as surely what had driven him north . What it was ,  |p246he  saw , was an almost superstitious disbelief in his new life , a fatal feeling that good could not keep begetting good : sooner or later , one 's luck would run out . But this too was curious . After all , why should he , one who so venerated the Good , dread it ? Because it might be undeserved ? Because it might not last ? And then Moore thought , What if Dorothy is pregnant ? Think of it : beyond these forests , across a sea , an effect of which he was the cause might be taking root in the womb of a woman curled on her side , asleep . In all the proofs of his ponderous Prolegomena , he wondered , why had he never considered this ? Amid all that grunting and rooting , in all that sweaty pumping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he failed to see all the priapic Good he might be sparking ? Creeping inside later , Moore found Wittgenstein fast asleep . So odd to watch another person sleeping , to see a man bereft of his waking power and stature  --  just a vulnerable animal craving rest , with his fingers stuffed in his mouth . Up here this man could sleep . Up here a man could lie dead for weeks , with no one the wiser . For a moment as he stood there , Moore had the feeling of them both living in a vacuum , two dimmingcandles , the last two souls on earth . Staring down at Wittgenstein , Moore wondered what , with none to remember this man , kept his heart beating and caused his lungs to expand ? Looking down then , Moore felt the uncanniness with which one life form eyes another , not knowing . what it is or how it makes its way in the world , wherein it has carved its little niche . What would ever become of him ? Moore wondered . How did Wittgenstein @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realized then that he did not know this man . He did not know him at all . Two days later , when Wittgenstein returned from cutting wood , the atmosphere broke . Moore had been reading Chesterton while he aired the bedding , and it got drenched in a downpour . Then , trying to dry it , he had trimmed the stove wrong and filled the hut with smoke . Wittgensteinlost his temper . How can you be such a bloody idiot ! Complain , complain , then this ! Damn you ! yelped Moore . Be quiet ! Please be quiet ! Moore jumped up from the table , throwing down his fists . He felt his head was in a tourniquet . He gulped to say something more , choked ; and then to his surprise , he burst into tears , stumbling as he lunged out the door . Moore was staring down at the fjord when the humbled Wittgenstein approached a few minutes later . Touching Moore 's shoulder , Wittgensteinsaid , I am sorry . I know I have been a beast . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anymore.  |p247Moore  pinched his eyes , then said , It 's not a matter of fault . I want to leave tomorrow , and not because of this . I miss my wife . All day long I 've been thinking of her . Green RecruitsIT WAS FORTUNATE that Pinsent arrived in Bergen a day early  --  otherwisehe would have missed Moore in the cottager 's lather to get back home . Instead , Pinsent and Moore spent a long evening together , over which Moore spun the whole sorry saga of his days trapped in the wilds with Wittgenstein . When Pinsent set off on the Sweimfoss two days later , Moore 's apprehensionswere still with him , but over the next days they steadily diminishedas Pinsent found the trip to be more what Wittgenstein promised and less the bilious , buggy ordeal that Moore had described . But then Pinsent was younger and more resilient than Moore , and he was n't leaving a wife  --  he was fleeing a mother . Wittgenstein knew all about Pinsent 's difficulties . Several weeks before , Flo had even sent him a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the page : My Dear Mr. Wittgenstein , Despite what David says , I am glad he will be visiting you . If I were younger &; if David did n't so mind I would visit you both . I know you would n't mind , would you ? I am very most grateful for the money you have bestowed on us you are a Prince even if you do have pots of it ;  --  but Sir , I still worry David will not return to university , &; it would be a purple shame for such a bright boy to make his way knocking on doors selling Sheffield cutlery . Do n't you agree ? It would be very good , Sir , if you would kindly tell him this . But PLEASE do not say I wrote you , as he wd . be furious . Even as a boy he was always running away from me , such a red-haired gnat , I said ;  --  &; you know how they are . Secondly , Mr. Wittgenstein , you ought to be aware that David is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ careful walking as I 've read a rock or snowball in that part of the world can cause a most unfortunate avalanche ! The fourth I forget.  |p248I  do not expect such a busy young man as yourself wd . write to me with the long winter only months away . But if so , do ;  --  but if you ca n't , do n't . I will certainly understand in either case . Gratefully yours , Florence PinsentPinsent arrived in Hoyanger in the second week of July . In his journal , he wrote : IO.VII.14 ... W. meets me at the dock . Surprised at my moustache ; also at my physique , as I admit to lifting dumbbells to prepare myself for the rigours of mountain life . We keep smiling at each other . He is tanned &; vigorous lookingfrom physical labour &; building his hut . His English has deteriorated a bit , as Moore said , but he is not nearly as " wild , " as Moore joked . No acclimatising for me in hotel as he did for M. We go directly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ W. highly pleased ; he says I have fared much better than M. So far , so good .. . W. 's hut overlooks the fjord , just as he described it . Mosquitoes bad , but not so bad as M. said . We smear ourselves with this evil local tallow &,; donning headnets , venture out into the midnight dawn colours , wch. hang like smoke in the cool air . Slap ! Slap ! Through even thick wool they pierce , these little bloodsuckers . Here one pays for the sublime . Later , sitting inside by the smoking fire , W. has a good laugh at my kit , esp . the Scout manual Mother sent , wch. actually looks somewhat helpful . Knowing that I have just seen M. in Bergen , W. asks if M. is angry . M. was badly hurt  --  hurt more badly than he even let on , I think  --  but I say little . W. knows I am holding back &; adds ominously , " You will tell me if I am being unreasonable . " I promise to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . W. very much annoyed . Grimacing . " Why do you start this ? Such a filthy habit  --  and so unnecessary . " Smiling , I say , " You told me to warn you if you become unreasonable . " " Yes , yes . You are right . " Watching me light &; exhale , he sees I will warn him again too . I I.VII.14Today we are still on our best behaviour ... Supper of eggs &; milk , canned peas &; fish . Make bannock bread over the fire as Mother 's surprisinglyuseful Scout manual sets forth . Wittgenstein 's eyes darken when I say I long for something sweet . " Not from you also . All I heard from Moore was food . We are not here to eat . " " And why not ? " I ask . " We are n't in a monastery . " W. is silent . For him we are , I think.  |p24913  . VII . 14When I ask to take W. 's photograph with my new camera , he grows uncomfortable . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am still too unapparent , like a larva . Once I become a full human being &; man of spirit  --  then you can photograph me . " He smiles . " As it stands , you may develop your film &; find no image whatsoever . " A week later , they were fairly settled , though still there were periodic rumblings . ZI.VII.r4 ... By now , we are getting fairly used to each other , but W. still has quirks wch . I do not understand . For instance , I ask why he has located the latrine such a distance from the hut . " It is more aesthetic , " he replies . " Perhaps so , " I say , " but you do n't venture out at night into the cold &; mosquitoes to relieve yourself ! " " Why do n't you use an empty tin ? " he suggests . " That would not bother you ? " " Why should it ? " he asks . " I do n't know , " I say . " I suppose because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But why must he brush his teeth for five minutes at a time ? Also , his prudishness . Will not dress in front of me . Averts his eyes when I dress . Also his preoccupation with cleanliness . Surgical procedures with dishes . After supper , we haul up buckets of water &; this does n't count all the wood necessary to heat it . " But surely , " I plead , " one bucket will do . " So he sullenly hauls a third &; fourth &; burns a whole pile of wood to boil our plates , laying them in the grass to dry in the to p.m. dawn . Despite these small frictions , they got along exceptionally well . Handy , hardy , and self-sufficient , Pinsent liked the small daily pleasures of mountainlife , the routine of keeping the rough wooden floor swept , the pots scoured , the knives and axes whetted , the woodpile stocked and the tins lined in the larder he built . In reaction to his mother 's chronic sloppiness , Pinsent was meticulously orderly , a quality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Freed from many of these chores , Wittgensteinwas again working steadily . Yet this , in turn , evoked Pinsent 's own ambivalent feelings of competition  --  an evanescent sense of drift . To their mutual discomfort , Pinsent even made several desultory commentsabout being Wittgenstein 's " servant " and " wife . " Then one afternoonPinsent saw something hanging on the clothesline. 2.3 . VII.14 ... W. is on the hillside , reading in the sun , when I see it , black &; flaccid , like ' a corset , with layered webs of rubber . I am still looking when I hearp250Wittgenstein call over harshly , " It 's a rupture belt . " Gratuitously , he adds , " In the spring I ruptured myself  --  since you are so curious . " His voice is daring me  --  I know he wants to hear nothing more of it , but I say , " Is it wise , all the lifting and heavy work you do ? Wo n't this make it worse ? " " I 'll be concerned with that ! " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The sight of it curdles me , rather . It 's like something found in childhood all shut up in a drawer &; best so . Must be torture to wear it , all hot &; pinching . Perhaps that is the appeal  --  his hair shirt .. . But the rupture belt was girding , as it were , another delicate matter : the question of what they each would do . Fall was approaching and with it the beginning of term . Wittgenstein planned to remain the winter , and it was clear to Pinsent that Wittgenstein hoped he would remain there with him . From his side , Wittgenstein felt selfish for this wish , worrying about the effect it would have not only on Pinsent but on Flo as well . Loath as he was to admit it , Wittgenstein saw there was much truth to Flo 's fear that David would shortchange himself for his sake . Pinsent , meanwhile , had an inkling of something else . Wittgenstein had described the experience of his father 's death . The postmaster 's wife and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wittgensteinnow said that he was beginning to recapture it . Implied was his secret wish that Pinsent might share this experience , that together they might undergo this spiritual revaluation . Like a pony feeling the accustomedknees of a rider nudging his flanks , Pinsent sensed Wittgenstein 's direction . And as he had done all his life , he stoutly resisted. 2 .. 5 . VII.14W. has intimated this religious " experience " he had , though he is quick to add that it was not religious in the conventional Christian sense ; it had , in fact , no Christian trappings whatsoever . W. does have an ambiguous relationship with religion from wch. he is , I suspect , a fugitive . I recall how he signed a recent letter : " God bless you  --  if there is such a thing . " It 's not the idea of God , he explains  --  he believes in God ( at least as an a priori )  --  it is this " bless " part he discounts  --  the thought of God going about blessing people strikes him as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than bless us , or not bless us ? " ) And yet , W. says , if God vouchsafes one ease after a time of torment , is this not a blessing ? Yes , this much he understands . I am more earthbound . W. bridles when I suggest this state may have been mere relief over the end of a painful &; difficult death ; contradictory feelingsp251about his father , etc . " Then you do n't understand ! " he retorts . " Psychologicalcrudities can not account for religious experience . " Later I say , " I do not think you could exist within the confines of conventionalreligion . You could not surrender to another authority . I think you have your own inward religion . " " No , " he insists . " That is only arrogance &; self-delusion . You must look out from the locus of your life ; you must look out on the world , not caring who or what you are . That is why I am here . Up here I am nothing , really nothing . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are or if it cares . Ask the animals . They take little notice of me , nor should they . " 30 . VII.14My understanding of people is retrospective . If I am quick &; perhaps clever in some ways , people may truly tell me anything to my face , esp . in the heat of the moment . They tell me the most atrocious lies , wch . I meekly apprehend with almost gaping mouth . Now I 'm thinking of this discussion of W. 's religious sense . Not being religious in the churchly sense , it makes me uncomfortable  --  I feel W. is directing me in the hope that I shall cultivate a similar sense . Into my hands he puts James 's Varieties of Religious Experience , commending James for his profound understanding of conversion and the mystic mind . While regretting my incapacity , I do not feel that I am the least bit susceptible to these mystic states ; at least not as I am at present . I suppose one justly fears conversion  --  the idea that one will feel compelled to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But for me it is mostly this fear that W. shall steal my soul &; make me a different man , in his image . As a result of my fears , I feel I must almost arbitrarily make my life in those nooks where W. is not , like the hardy lichen one sees here clinging to the mountain rocks . Well , at least it is kind to the feet . Reindeer also depend on it , I 'm told . Z.VIII.14I am getting more adept at handling our little sailboat . Today , as is often the case , I handle the boat while W. writes . The wind is blowing colder ; the water scatters with the wind . When we come about , I call out so W. does n't get knocked by the boom , since he is utterly unaware of me or the day ; or - the boat ; or of anything . Often he does not hear me . Or remembers , as if just asked , about something he failed to respond to an hour , or a day , ago . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sun comes out &; I feel a promise ; it goes in , &; I feel a chill . Ever since childhood I have felt such  --  warm sun on my cheek , eyes half shut , feeling the wind &; that half-dazed , pleasantp252sense of foreverness . The sun is out , &; it is summer ; in it goes &; I feel winter gloaming . The farmer 's dogs are getting thicker coats , as are our three shaggy horses . My red hair is much too wispy  --  wrong for this clime . Could I exist the winter here with him ? It would be like overstoking the stove . He would drive me out with the heat . As it turned out , though , Pinsent did not have to decide whether to leave or stay . The decision came when Wittgenstein 's neighbor Nordstrom rode out with a ten-day-old paper , which said there was to be a war . That night , Pinsent wrote : I I.VIII.14 ... Wittgenstein , who until several hours ago was ready to vow himself for sainthood , is roused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Austrian archduke , who even W. admits was an ass . I ask W. , " You mean Austria is willing to risk a general European war to discipline Serbia  --  and all because of two students ? " Suddenly W. is a firebreathing patriot . From the heights a despicable politics emerges . He says these are not students but " revolutionaries , " and these unregenerate frontier peoples must be taught a " lesson . " " Then you will fight ? " I ask in disbelief . " Of course , " he says . " And shoot somebody  --  with a gun ? " I ask again in amazement . Stalwartly , he nods , &; I walk away in disgust . They rode into Hoyanger the next day . In a three-day-old paper , the most recent they could find , they read that fighting had already broken out . Austria-Hungary had declared war on Serbia , causing Russia to begin mobilizing . Germany had then declared war on Russia and her ally France , and then Britain had declared war on Germany after her forces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Reports now said that the German armies in Belgium were taking and inflicting heavy losses amid talk of atrocities against the populace . Austria-Hungary , meanwhile , was mounting a punitive operation against Serbia while sending other forces to halt the dangerous . Russian advance from the East . Wittgenstein wired his family that he would be home within ten days . Pinsent was waiting with the horses when Wittgenstein emerged from posting his wire . They rode back to the hut in silence . Over the next week , Pinsent 's entries became almost telegraphic , the days running down like an old clock . Attempting to strike a hopeful note , I say , " They predict it will be over quickly . " W. frowns : " It will not be over quickly . Not with the Russians . "  |p253I  say , " You just do n't want to miss it . " W. says nothing . He has begun to pack. *Later W. comes to me . " I have money in the bank at Bergen . I want to give it to you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practicality , I retort , " Would n't that be aiding the enemy ? " " Stop it ! " he says . " This changes nothingbetween us . Nor between any of my English friends . " Nodding , I say , " Do you actually believe that ? Do you really ? " *I am sitting outside , feeling ill . It is afternoon &; we have not spoken a word since breakfast . Suddenly he appears &; demands , " Will you take the money ? " Obstinately , I say , " But you have given us money . I ca n't take any more from you . " " For your mother , then ! " he insists . " Do n't be an ass ! " But he sees I wo n't take it &; turns away in frustration . An hour later W. comes to me again , very alarmed with something that clearly has just occurred to him . " You will not enlist , will you ? " " And why not ? " I ask . He says , " Because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Do n't drag Mother into it , " I say . " Mine is n't the only mother with a son . " This time I stalk off &; hear him call , " You are doing this only to defy me ! You said you could not carry a rifle in good conscience . " " Then I will carry a stretcher. " *We are eating when , with a look of sudden relief , he says , " But they will not take you ! Your deaf ear . This will keep you out . " " Only in one ear , " I say . " They 'll never find out . " Then I remember &; say , much relieved myself , " And what about your rupture ? They wo n't have you , either ! " But W. has already considered this . " I will have surgery . My family has also tremendous influence . The army will take me , I assure you . My mother has also two sons and two daughters . And no material cares . But your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " *Nordstrom rides out . W. tells him we are leaving &; says he can take everything , except the horses , wch. he is donating to a church in Hoyanger for charity auction . I am packed . Our belongings sit by the door. *p254Later , I say , " What if we became doctors ? We could go away &; do anything . What are wars or governments up here ? You would deny hippopotamuses or my existence , yet you acknowledge governments &; races of people avengingthemselves . Where is your mystical now ? A year from now you may find yourself bayonetting me in the gut . " At this his voice cracks . " Stop ! You will be fighting Germans , Germans ! And I will be fighting Russians . Never will we even see one another . " Nordstrom comes with his sons to say good-bye &; take away everything . Carrying off our pots &; utensils , he leaves us cooked food to eat until our departure in the morning . I am not hungry . The stove is cold , but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sputters . In six hours not a word between us . Outside in the half dark , W. is transfixed . He is sitting on the stool with a hat &; the mosquito net drawn like a shroud over his face  --  looking like a condemned man , I think . I walk down and sit on the hill . There I feel that the world , so full of promise a week ago , has turned on us . Like a bird of prey , the earth has sunk its beak into its own dark breast. *It 's all up today . On the eaves , I see the wasps sealing up their nests . I have an angry impulse to set their nest &; ours afire  --  let us be off like those dead Norse warriors , pushed out to sea in burning ships . Listen to me  --  already a bitter , destructive impulse has seized me by the throat. *We carve our names above the door : D.P. &; L.W . i8.VIII.i4 . W. is red-eyed &; on the verge ; he can not look at me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the war ; he says life is always ready to be shaken off &; taken up again once you find it . I am not such a mystic or optimist . We will leave the door open for travellers . We will leave the door open so the spirits may depart , but without much hope they will return. *In Bergen , before we part , W. asks me to go with him to a church service . Why must he prolong it ? For days we have been saying good-bye . But for him I go to this church  --  what church , I do n't know or care . What does he expect ? Even if the service were in English , it would be no less foreign to me , dead to song , dead to words . And Wittgenstein thinks I am a naif ; if so , I am not the only one . Sitting beside me , his eyes tightly shut , W. seems as if he is praying for a miracle . He is asking the Almighty to speak to him  --  to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Yes , I think , the Almighty has a plan for us , but not the one he wishes. *I go first . Quick &; sweet is how I want it . We promise to write as long as there are mails ; we promise to meet here after the war  --  fairy tales to me as we embrace &; I board . Then the train is starting , swaying and rattling , &; I am stumbling into the loo ; &; then , suddenly , I am crying in spurts into my hand , a wrenching , spilt feeling , knowing somehow we shall never meet again . Whether from your end or mine , it will not happen again , Luddy , not in this world or the next  --  not ever.  |p259RUSSELL  WAS IN AMERICA , winding up his lecture series , when news of the archduke 's assassination came from Sarajevo . Russell had been a rousing success in America , where he was surprised to find himself famous , far more highly regarded than he was as yet in England . His whereabouts and quips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four and five hundred packed the halls where he spoke about our knowledge of the external world . At Harvard , home of the New Realism , where his Principia Mathematica was already a sort of Bible , he taught several classes and found the faculty and students to be friendly and highly receptive to his ideas , though rather backward by English standards . As for America , he found it barbaric . He wrote Ottolinelong letters railing about the disgusting food and the smells in his hotel room , where windows were never opened , about the spittoons and Boston 's ossified matrons who , along with their stuporous husbands , gorged themselves at tedious banquets given in his honor . Still , he had to admit he liked the adulation  --  especially from the ladies who clamored around him after each lecture , nervously asking gratuitous questions and hanging on his every word as he edged toward the door . They seem to find me irresistibly brilliant and witty , he wrote Ottoline . I find the attention most flattering , and hope I shall not be seduced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russell was seduced soon enough by a young woman who came mooning up to him after his third lecture and introduced herself as Doris Dudley . She hovered there a moment before she added impulsively , You may remember me as D.D .  --  this as she deftly stepped in front of an older woman who had been waiting a good ten minutes for a word with him . Wo met last year at Oxford  --  Professor Norris introduced us , Professor Norris of Princeton ? Russell opened his mouth expectantly , but nothingp260jogged . With a wriggle , D.D . scrunched still closer , pushing her smiling face up to his , as if they were being thrown together on a bus ( the woman behind her cleared her throat indignantly ) , then said with a telling smirk , I 'm the writer you met . At which point he raised his eyes , still without the foggiest idea who she was , and said , Ahh  --  wondering what he should do . But in fact he did n't have to do anything . With that word from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she admired his work and loved England , and how she had come all the way from Chicago just to attend his lectures , all the while blithely blocking the other woman while he signed her copy of that new transatlantic sensation , Problems in Philosophy . D.D . gushed : I 've never read anything that can make  --  profunditiesso , well . . . accessible and , I mean , interesting .. . Oh , she had his attention , all right . She was about twenty-five , rather plain , with thin , catlike lips , a blunt nose , wispy bobbed brown hair and a good , if not excellent , figure , a fact he could not help but notice as D.D . finally stepped aside for the sputtering woman , allowing Russell to better discern the solid rump and frank , uncorseted breasts floating beneath the clingy folds of her white knit dress . There was a certain sweet , beguiling quality about her , careless as a cow and seemingly mindless of the potent and musky heat she exuded . On second glance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unsophisticated  --  so peculiarly American : her wan earthiness reminded him of some lone pioneer woman , a sort of American Ruth , plain as rain , the opposite of Ottoline . But , Professor Russell , said D.D. , sashaying up again . Professor , about your statements on intuition in philosophy .. . Ostensibly , she was asking him a philosophical question , but implicit in her voice and every gesture was her willingness  --  indeed , her eagerness  --  to go to bed with him . He was so thrilled that he abruptly ended the conversation , pleading a prior engagement , then fled to his hotel room and wrote Ottoline two letters , one for that night and one for the next , already remorseful for what was about to happen . At his lecture the following evening , with a red-hot horseshoe in his stomach , he saw D.D . sitting in the first row , diligently taking notes . Afterward she stood tactfully off to one side , beaming like a valedictorian as the gaggle rushed up to greet him . This time he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and put on a bold red tie . He had even crunched up a precautionary mint before he winnowed up his papers and skipped down off the stage . Without a word from him , D.D . cheerfully waited until the last of the crowd had left , then followed him outside ,  |p261ghostly  and remotely histrionic as she told him about the stories she wrote and of her dreams of becoming a great writer . For over an hour they talked . Then , as they passed beneath a tree , he pulled her toward him , kissing her roughly , while within , the subdued and impeccable mathematician watched his growling , heavy-breathing alter ego , aghast . Russell felt himself to be the aggressor , but then he was shocked to feel D.D . ' s nails dig into the small of his back , as she said in a gargling voice , Come with me , darling . I 'm just two blocks away . There 'll be no problem . How odd , he thought , hurrying with her across the deserted square and up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She 's already calling me darling . D.D . was efficient . Within minutes , it seemed , her blouse was hiked up and she was squeezing her breasts into his mouth , whining and smiling as her slick hair whipped softly from side to side . Afterward he was even remotely touched as D.D . poured out her grief and loneliness , the relentless pressures of her art and her need for a mentor . Lonely himself , he thought the girl would provide a pleasant interlude . So the next day , while D.D . looked on , stricken , he read Little Lamb , a highly charged and disjointed story of how Penelope falls for Charlie , a beer truck driver who runs over her white poodle in a rainstorm . All that remained of poor Tuffet was a runover rag of red fur , one bag full . Penelope wailed under the beating , bleating rain while the brawny beer truck driver delicately nudged the canine corpse into an empty beer box with a stick . " Here she is , Miss , " stammered the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I-I do n't know what to sss-say . " Russell did n't quite know what to say either . Resounding silence as he pretended to savor the final paragraph  --  the last jarring alliteration  --  where the repentant Charlie lashes himself to a " tall and terrible tree " in a lightning storm , calling out to God to strike him down as Penelope struggles to free him . Remembering his own misdeeds in his now buried novet , and seeing D.D . ' s hungry and desolate look , Russell heard himself say that he thought her story , while not entirely successful , showed definitepromise . Wringing her hands , D.U . brightened and said , Do you ? Do you really ? I want the truth , the total , terrible truth.  |p262Truly  , he said , feeling trapped . I would not lie about another person 's talent . The story shows genuine . . . potential . But darling , said D.D. , wringing her hands . First you said it has promise , now you say potential . Sucking the chewed end of her pencil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , It 's the ending , is n't it ? I 'm just too subtle . That 's my whole problem . The white poodle , for instance  --  did you get the symbol of the paschal lamb ? And the fact that there were three trees  --  that doomed feeling of Calvary . I thought of having Charlie nail his hand to the tree with an iron spike . Would you have liked that better ? Frowning , Russell said in a hush , I think not . The ending 's best left as it is , I think , though the language might stand a little , ah . . . toning down . Not much , he added gently . But a bit . A bit . D.D . ' s bangs gently slapped her face . You do n't like it ! Oh , God , I knew it , I knew it ! But I do like it , he protested . Thank God , she said , rushing into his arms . I could never love a man who did n't love my work , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the first , but in his heart he knew where the girl 's best talents lay . Nevertheless , she was something new for him  --  someone modern , rather . Unlike Ottoline , D.D . was always open to his advances , even hungry for him , bouncing and panting , with her eyes rolled back into her head . Even after two weeks , her lust for him had n't diminished ; she said he was a better lover than men half his age , a compliment he did n't entirely believe but was nonetheless pleased to entertain . Indeed , his opinion of D.D . and her writing , though certainly qualified , grew in more or less direct proportion to her desire for him . As for his letters to Ottoline , they continued , albeit with increasingly fictionalized accounts of his activities . But then after two weeks , burdenedby conscience , he came clean  --  half clean , anyhow . He told his mistress that he had just met a young American woman named Doris Dudley . And lest Ottoline think this was just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russell said that the young woman was a writer and was actually somewhat talented . Being totally aboveboard , if not provocative , Russell even said he had slept with Miss Dudley and was really quite fond of her . Yet here he was quick to assure his unappreciative and , he hoped , now jealous mistress that the girl would never displace Ottolinein his affections , much less occupy that innermost spiritual sanctum that he reserved strictly for her . He was no less candid with D.D . When she asked if he was seeing anyp263women in England , he said , Just one at present . But she 's married and we are merely very warm friends . I 'd call it a spiritual friendship , actually . They had just finished making love . Looking at him jealously , D.D . said , But that 's what I must have with you ! We must be one flesh ! You must know me , you must ! But I do know you , said Russell evasively . No , you do n't ! No man has ever known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each other completely  --  I mean the way Keats said , with our souls fusing  --  D.D . clapped her hands together dramatically  --  solutionsweet ! Russell groaned . I 've always hated that line . Much too mushy . But , damn it , said D.D. , reaching between her legs and then smearing the goo on his chest . Sex is oozy and mushy ! Russell recoiled as if he 'd been doused with scalding coffee . The towel  --  hand me that towel ! You 're behaving like a savage . D.D . pounced down beside him . And you 're acting like a damned prude . My being bloody and oozy last week did n't stop you from poking it in . And quit staring at me like that . You look like some nasty old lizard . Never in his life had a woman spoken to him in this way . I did not poke it in , he protested . Certainly I did not smear you with it . He thought that was the end of it , but a moment later , as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he glanced up at the mirror and saw her behind him . Hissing , D.D . had her tongue between her teeth and her thumbs plugged in her ears , her fingers wriggling like gills . Doris ! he demanded . What  --  But then , before he could say another word , she had him locked round the neck , panting as she fired her agile tongue into his mouth . And then , just as suddenly , she stopped , gravely serious as she asked : Do you believe God is watching us ? You mean , Do I think God is a voyeur ? Do n't you dare profane him ! D.D . was more than just vehement  --  shelooked as if she would strike him . Covering her breasts , she continued : He is watching , you know . If you were more alive , you would seethat  --  you 'd feel far more than you do . You think I 'm just a whore , do n't you ! You think I was just put here for your amusement ! D.D. , he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to offendyou . But she pushed him away . I wo n't have your blasphemy and condescension . I know what you 're after , and the free lunch is closed.  |p264They  lurched back and forth through good days and bad , with Russell hungrily following her sex , half conscious , like a bird bobbing along a trail of crumbs . He had hardly known her a month when his lectures ended , and she invited him to come with her for a week 's visit to her parents ' home near Chicago . D.D . made it all seem very casual . In view of the short time they had known each other , Russell saw no danger that the Dudleys would feel their daughter was " bringing him home . " Besides , he had a paper to deliver at the University of Chicago , and he was curious about the Middle West . A few days later , after a stopover in Chicago , they arrived by train in Wazooka , Illinois , D.D . ' s hometown , where her father was waiting in his fire-engine-red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ councilman and booster , was a mustached man of massive good health who immediately took charge of his daughter and her foreign guest . Do n't you dare , he said with comic gruffness , poking his cocked finger like a pistol into Russell 's ribs when he attempted to tip the colored porterbringing up their luggage . You just keep your hands out of your pocketswhile you 're here , Mr. Russell . Here go , Jimmy . Dr. Dudley then insisted on giving his guest the " cook 's tour " of Wazooka . Honking and waving to everyone they passed , he pointed out the new school , the meat-packing plant and the town characters , sitting on crates and busted-out chairs by the ice house and garage . Friendly sorts , rather , only Russell noticed that they all seemed to have the most extraordinarilydeformed ears  --  either too big or too small , and all oddly crumpled . With their lips fat with snuff or cheeks bugged out with chaws of tobacco , they waved and called out things he could n't understand over the flat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fish in that little backwater , the Dudleys lived in a lofty , whiteturretedhouse that presided over a quiet street of hedge-bound bungalows . A stone wall bristling with a fence of iron arrows surrounded their property , and every morning Dr. Dudley raised a flag into the boundless Midwestern sky with that absurd and flabby American optimism which , to Russell 's English soul , was like staring into the void . Mrs. Dudley was a handsome woman , far more reserved than her husband , but active nonetheless in their church and various civic organizations . She was alwayson the telephone , one of two that seemed to never stop ringing . Gadabout Dr. Dudley , meanwhile , seemed to always be off to another meeting . Scarcely had they finished supper that first night than Dr. Dudley , Grand Mugwump of the Aragolak Oddfellows , came down attired in an oversnug tuxedo and wearing on his head a whole hollowed-out beaver , complete with teeth , tail and clawed feet.  |p265Try  this on for size , he said , his laughter like air wheezing from a tire as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr. Dudley was showing his guest the Oddfellows ' mystic handshake when D.D . groaned , Daddy .. . Now , daughter , countered Dr. Dudley tolerantly , feigning ebullient surprise . I 'm just trying to show your English friend how we are here in Wazooka . Russell went along with these rites with the hapless bonhomie of an explorer among aborigines , eating corn on the cob and bloody steaks that " still mooed , " rocking on the porch , drinking beer and pitching horseshoes . And without any particular effort on Russell 's part , the indefatigableDr . Dudley took right to him , bringing him downstairs the second night to show him his weapons collection  --  rifles , swords , Indian war clubs and a scalp of fine red hair that Russell politely declined to handle . Oh , dearest darling , said D.D. , waylaying him afterward , Daddy really likes you . He 's never shown that junk to anybody I 've brought home before . Conscious of his age , Russell was rather surprised by this warm reception , but he need n't have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , best of all , titled , having been told by their daughter that he was next in line for an earldom . The third day , Dr. Dudley dressed Russell in cape and goggles and took him for a long and dusty drive . Presumed heir of all creation , supremely confident , even reckless in his driving , Dr. Dudley showed the greenhorn " God 's country "  --  so many flat and snoring miles of corn , swine , rail depots and cattle . Yet this rich land that Russell found so bleak and unpromising spoke eloquently to Dr. Dudley , who in the sonorous tones of an auctioneer gabbed about endless " deals " involving options , liens , deaths , deeds and probate sales . Lurching to a stop in a cloud of dust , he made a grand sweep of his arm , as if to tell the suitor that if he played his cards right all this and more might be his one day . Giving him a conspiratorial little goose on the shoulder the fourth day , I ) r . Dudley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russell . She 's stubborn , our D.D . Gets something in her head and wo n't turn it loose . Guess it 's partly ' me . Wanted a son , got me a tomboy . Well , I raised her to be independent , but , heck , I 'll be frank . Her mother and I were kinda worried about her for a while . She was just a little confused , I guess , but I 'm glad  --  darned glad she 's straightened out and found herself a nice fella like you . Just wanted you to know that . You 're all right in my book . Russell did n't know how to react to the " glad " part and was sorelyp266tempted to ask Dr. Dudley just what he meant by the " confused " part . But before he could get a word in , the jocular doctor , uneasy after this moment of male intimacy , deftly changed the subject . That afternoon , though , Mrs. Dudley piqued Russell 's curiosity again . As they walked in the garden , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how happy she was that Doris had finally brought home someone respectable . I want to get to know her again , ventured Mrs. Dudley cryptically . For a while I 'm afraid we did n't know our daughter . Really ? said Russell diplomatically . When was this ? Stopping to pick a weed their elderly gardener had missed , Mrs. Dudleyconsidered a moment , then said , Oh , after she left the convent , I guess . Or before . But then , seeing this was news to him , Mrs. Dudley got all fluttery , saying , Goodness ! I forgot all about the roast . Grasping , Russell hastily said , You used the word " convent , " Mrs. Dudley . I thought you and Dr. Dudley were Presbyterians ? Oh , said Mrs. Dudley , flinching . Well , of course , this was after Doris converted . Much against our wishes , I might add . To which he , ever the gentleman , replied , Oh , and smiled politely as the mother cheerfully added , But it 's all over , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ check her loin of pork . I refuse to discuss it ! insisted D.D . when he questioned her later . Then , spitefully , she said , I told you that you do n't know me ! But you know what I really hate ? You never even asked ! But hearing this , the suitor did n't want to ask . That night , Friday , Dr. Dudley departed for his Shriners meeting in a tassled maroon fez on which ABDUL was written in rhinestones . Upstairs , D.D . and Mrs. Dudley , who , on second glance , seemed to Russell rather cold toward her only child , had a brief screaming match . Hurried feet and slamming doors . Then , with a transfigured look , D.D . ran down the stairs , saying in a vicious tone , Do n't worry about her . She urgently led him by the hand to the closetlike back stairs , where she bolted the door and lit a candle . I 'll bet you never had a nun before , did you ? she said . That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do you know how hard I prayed not to be tempted ? Do you think for a second it worked ? They shaved my head and screamed at me . I thought I was nuts . D.D . ' s eyes glowed as she pressed closer to him . I 've had visions , you know  --  at night there , under the covers , I was on fire . They were all lesbians . They used to tie me up in wet sheets . In her open palm , he saw a rolled condom . Her knees wobbled as shep267hiked up her dress and guided his trembling hands , saying , Do you love me ? Do you ? A nun does n't come cheaply , you know . For this , you can say ten thousand Hail Marys ! Two hundred thousand Our Fathers .. . In the flickering darkness , her powerful vagina gobbled him in like a Chinese handcuff as a floorboard creaked . And like a loose egg he was cooked  --  two minutes , done . Oddly , they got along better after that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each had a different notion of just where things stood . Russell could afford to be kind now that his stint in the alien corn was over . Two days later , he was off for Boston to tie up some loose ends , then bound for England . In the meantime , he did n't want to upset these nice people by telling them that their bohemian daughter and he had not the slightest intention of getting hitched . D.D . understood him , he thought  --  that was what mattered . And again , the next day , when the Dudleys were outside , D.D . made love to him with impressive speed and ingenuity , reducing him to a gibbering , moaning ninny as she bounced atop him , preening her breasts and lean young stomach before his hot , watery eyes . Russell , in rut , said impulsively , You must come to England sometime ! Bertie , dearest darling ! cried D.D . I 'd follow you anywhere ! War TrophySTEAMING across the Atlantic on the Northumberland a week later , Russellfound himself wondering if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After all , it was one thing for her to visit him in England ( and several weeks together might be rather agreeable , he thought with a grin ) , but surely , even D.D. , in all her wild imagination , could not possiblythink that he meant for her to come and stay  --  certainly not to live or marry . No , he thought , she could n't possibly be that naive  --  they were not even remotely suited to each other . He promised himself that he would write her a long letter when he arrived in England , a warm , appreciative letter that would boost her spirits while gently cutting her loose , leavingp268her a few fond memories and a good deal the wiser . Still , in his anxious moments , he was tempted to send a telegram flatly telling her not to come . But each time he ruled it out as being too cruel  --  cruel and probablyunnecessary , since by now she surely realized that it was only a passingfancy . With this , then , he put D.D . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Austria 's escalating dispute with Serbia , a dispute that increasinglythreatened to involve the other European powers . Russell found the news depressing , but even more depressing was the delight his fellow English passengers took in it . It sickened and amazed him how fierce and irrational , how clannish and thick , they could be , these bland , tweedy salesmen and cottagers and their pale wives  --  how people who would be morally repelled at the thought of blood sports could , in the next breath , declare their high-minded willingness to pack their sons off to slaughter Germans . Once or twice a day some bilious old fool would come huffing back from the wireless room with the latest news , setting the whole ship astir . Afternoons in the ship 's lounge , between darts and quaffs of black and tan , the old poppycocks would prognosticate , matchingthe French army against the German and England 's dreadnoughts against all corners . As for the ship 's fifteen German passengers , they were treated with the disdainful correctitude accorded to people about to be deported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two tables at the far end of the dining room and rarely speaking above urgent whispers . The passage was generally chilly and overcast , with gray girders of light that sheared off into the ocean 's gray-black deeps . Russell generally held his distance from the other passengers , working every morning on an article for the philosophical journal Mind , then walking the decks in the afternoons , when the ship 's lackluster amateur band could be heard practicing The Turkey Trot and Rose in the Bud . He was gloomy about his prospects in England , unsure what he wanted from Ottoline and even more hesitant about his work . America , in that sense , had been a vacationwhere he could coast on brilliance and reputation without doing the brutal work that had made him famous  --  work that , after the blows Wittgenstein had given him , he wondered if he would ever do again . He now had more offers for lectures and books than he could possibly handle , but nothing that seemed to him especially vital or important . Back in Cambridge , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Wittgenstein had dictated to Moore in Norway  --  a Pandora 's box that he was almost afraid to open . And for all Russell knew , Wittgenstein wasp269charging off to enlist . Knowing Wittgenstein 's recklessness , Russell felt almost sure he would never survive a war , and so Russell found himself faced with the equally depressing prospect of holding a box without a key . Often in those days just before the war , Russell felt like a fraud . Becausefor all his expressions of principle and humanity , he saw there was also a nihilistic side of him that was as eager for war as anybody , eager that , for better or worse , life might change . The news , meanwhile , grew worse . Returning to his cabin after breakfast one morning , Russell saw his first iceberg , a glowing , white-hot hull whose heights it seemed he could never scale as he watched it slip by , smoking white against the fog and alive with the cries of birds he could not see . Three days later , on July 21  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russell arrived in London . Ottoline sounded cool when he rang her up but finally agreed to meet him that afternoon at Mrs. Dood 's flat . After D.D . and almost three months apart , neither of them knew what to do once Ottoline finally arrived , late as usual . Wantingto make himself desire her more than he did , Russell kissed her passionately , but she felt limp and bony . Her mouth fell open , loose and pulpy , and as he drew away , he noticed new wrinkles around her lips . You 're angry with me , he said . I 'm not , she insisted , squirming from his grasp . But I have been thinkingthat it would be best  --  Do n't say it  --  It would not be best . She clenched her hands in exasperation . You do n't even know what I 'm about to say ! I do n't want to completely end our relationship , if that 's your fear . But I do think it ought to be platonic . He felt suddenly hot and claustrophobic . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 're just angry with me . Turning away , she said , Please , just leave me a moment . Ottoline lit a cigarette and began walking restlessly around the room , straightening things that did n't need straightening and eluding his expectanteyes until at last she said : I do , I think we should cease any further sexual involvement . You need a wife , and I need my peace . Believe me , I was thinking of this before you left  --  long before you mentioned this girl . Come now , darling , face facts . I can hardly compete with a woman twenty years my junior . Why on earth would I even want to ? Surely you find her physically more desirable . How could you not ?  |p270He  sat down , his head splitting as he squeaked , I do not find her more desirable . Oh , please , scoffed Ottoline . Sensing his comparative inexperience in this new situation , she felt a gathering sense of power and ruthlessness , as she did when she had him pinned in the reflex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tear off the mask and tell him about Lamb , to say that she knew far better than he the pleasures of a young body . Come now , she jabbed . Why not admit it ? You do n't really want me as a lover now . Oh , maybe you think you do . And I tell you , he said on the verge of tears , that 's not true . He was trapped , no more able to admit to her than he could to himself that he did n't want her . To say that was like sentencing himself to a future of privation and loneliness . Embracing her , he crumpled down beside her on the sofa , groping for the small breasts that did n't rebound and fill his hands when squeezed , amazed at the lumps and swags on her thighs that were n't on D.D . ' s . Ottoline was all atwitch . Elbows poking , feet squirming , she clapped her thighs on his digging hands , her hair filling his mouth like dry feathers as her face slid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to remove her clothes just to find her , but all he found was a brittle , middle-aged body like his own . Grazing over . her , searching for a spot to start , he probed her like an ache , but she would n't be roused . In the end he had his way , but she , suffering all the while , proved her point about the hopelessness of it . Dogged as a tortoise mounting a rock , he gave one last spasm , then lapsed back into the gelid sea of his mind , not even moving as Ottoline rose in silence , her joints cracking as she crept off to wash herself . Still , she did n't let him get away with it . After a long silence , as they were dressing , she asked , And you actually think she 's a good writer ? He was tying his tie , but with this he lost his place , eyeing her miserablyas he dropped the loops . Oh , she has talent  --  some , though not much . She has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We frequently quarreled . I know we never fought like that . Ottoline raised her eyes and he reddened , embarrassed to have referred to them in the past tense . Just to be sure , Ottoline said , So you do n't love her ? Grateful she asked , he replied emphatically , Absolutely not . Skeptical but now faintly conciliatory , Ottoline said , Well , you certainlythought you did . Would you care to see your letters ? He knew he would have to swallow this , the ritual abasement . He gavep271her some digs , but then he played his trump , saying , Darling , I do want to break with her , I swear it . The problem is , I 'm afraid she may be coming to England to visit me . You invited her here ? Only once . Very casually . I certainly never expected her to jump at the idea the way she did . We were with her family . I could n't very well cause a scene . Ottoline was agog . Could n't cause a scene ? Think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crossed the Atlantic for nothing ! I did n't purposely mislead her , if that 's what you think . I rather doubt she 'll come , in any case , he added weakly . I sent her a letter yesterday  --  a very kind letter , in fact  --  explaining my feelings and saying it would be best to break it off . Russell affected a heartless look . And if she misses my letter and comes  --  well , I 'll simply tell her how things stand with us . Ottoline parted her hands of this . You 'll not drag me into this ! Do n't you dare ! I 'll not risk scandal because of your stupidity . But then curiosity got the better of Ottoline , who snidely demanded , Now , tell me . Just what does this little writer of yours look like , anyway ? But D.D . was forgotten over the next days as it grew increasingly likely that England would be drawn into a general European war . Feeling in Parliament about England 's entry into war was volatile and divided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neutrality , even going so far as to suggest that he might speak to Russell , who , she said , had done considerable thinking on the subject . Philip , not one to let personal matters interfere with the national weal , readily agreed . He even told her to invite Russell to dinner to discuss the matter . With the war , then , began the gradual unfreezing of relations between Russell , Ottoline and Philip . In fact , there arose between them an odd alliance , as if even Philip sensed that Russell was no longer a true rival for Ottoline 's affections . Yet how sublimely odd it was for Russell , after all these years of being persona non grata at Bedford Square , to hear his name announced in his mistress 's home , then to sit across from the guilty wife and his former nemesis , armed only with an arch look , a glass of sherry and a napkin on his knee . In this competition to see who could be the most natural and charming , Russell regaled them for nearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his amused host , meanwhile , interjected some able quips and anecdotes of his own , all the while corn/paring , as Russell did , the amplitude of Ottoline 's self-conscious laughter . After dinner , they got down to business , with Russell holding forth about the four different kinds of wars : wars of colonization , principle , self-defense and prestige . Of the four , Russell felt that the first two , colonizationand principle , were often justified . As for the third , self-defense , it was only rarely justified , and then only against an opponent of inferior civilization . But wars of the fourth type  --  wars of prestige like this one  --  these , he said , could never be justified , being based on national vanity and offering only the rewards of hubris . Having made these distinctions , Russell told Philip , who was no more a pacifist than he himself was , that he would have to take great care in crafting his speech . To preserve his credibility , he would have to make it clear that he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of prestige like this one . Watching her politic husband take counsel from her lover , Ottoline was appalled at her own folly , feeling that in her amorous conquests , she had likewise been waging a war of prestige  --  or rather staving off a feared loss of prestige through failing desirability . Why had she ever embarked on this dangerous course ? she wondered . Russell , she saw , was neither as handsome as Philip nor even remotely as kind . So why had n't Philip been enough for her ? And why , when she had a husband who adored her and when  --  she had to admit it  --  she was losing her appeal , why did she still feel this urge to squander herself , holding herself up as a kind of Helen , a trophy for the men ? Philip 's speech in the House of Commons aroused much hostility but it also helped rally pockets of beleaguered support  --  enthusiasm that instantlyevaporated the next day , August 4 , when war was declared and many violently opposed to war turned violently in favor of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up all night in various Parliamentarysessions , telephoned , no sooner telling her the news than he burst into tears . She immediately called Russell , who had remained in London , asking him to meet her in Russell Square , across from the British Museum . Russell had been waiting for fifteen minutes when he saw her coming down the path , egretlike in a watery silk dress that snapped about her spindly , purple-stockinged ankles . A brooding black hat shadowed her eyes , which were swollen from crying . To him , her powdered cheeks suggestedthe fuzzy wings of a moth ; her lips seemed ill aligned , flat , the teeth more equine . He did n't even seem especially aware that he wasp273looking , but Ottoline knew very well what it was . She saw , as he did , that she was now crossing a kind of invisible equator , and that her looks were losing their youthful consistency , causing her to look rather attractiveone day , haggard the next . Today was the unappealing , temperamentalOttoline , the Ottoline who expected more , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more remote . Ottoline gave him her usual pecking public kiss , but turned away when he attempted to hold her a moment , saying , I know , darling , but if it 's all the same to you , I 'd like to walk . This galled him  --  the nerve of her , fending him off unprovoked , especially when he felt almost no desire for her . Picking along the path , dubiously dabbing the red gravel with her toe , Ottoline was in a funk , half oblivious to him as she said : Is n't it unearthly ? I feel as if we 're still awaiting the results of some horrible election . Philip was so dashed when he called . He says they 're mad , every one of them . Here they are , up all night debating and drafting resolutions , as if they could actually do anything in the face of this war lunacy . And the amazing thing is no one cares . No one will even listen now . All they want is blood . Stopping then , Ottoline rummaged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nut between her teeth , she furiously crunched it up , drawing out her lips as she continued : I 'm taking Julian away for a few days . I do n't care where  --  the seaside or someplace . Anywhere where she wo n't see these ghoulish mobs celebrating . I ca n't stand it  --  the idea of being bottled up in England for God knows how long with these . . . these horror fanatics ! She looked at him , so self-contained and distant , smug . What I mean , she added , with an exasperated sigh , is that it 's bound to bring down the  --  I do n't know  --  values . And then there 's no beauty left but just ugliness , and us standing up like targets for the mob .. . Then , seeing that he did n't know what she was saying , she said irritably , My point . . . Yet as she struggled , her confidence fell another notch , and she said more grimly , What I mean . . . You see , my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her like a bug , and seeing , to her mortificatiop , that she had lost her point , she collapsed with a groan on the next bench , weeping into her gloved hands . He sat down and patted her hand , but it was no good . All she felt was his cely kindness , so patronizing and automatic . And his mind was elsewhere ; he could n't very well hide it . The day , a Tuesday , felt more like a Sunday , it was so quiet . As yet there were no mobs , no ringing bells orp274parades . The delirious catharsis of relief and national unity that had greeted the declarations of war in Vienna , St. Petersburg , Berlin and Paris would come over the next days . Nevertheless , the war was rolling . For days now on the Continent , the war 's momentum had been steadily gathering , each nation following mobilization schedules that had been drawn up years in advance . Across Europe , endless trains filled with men , field pieces , provisions and pack animals were rolling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were rushing through neutral Belgium on their way to flatten France , while Austria , with all her incompetent bluster , was in the midst of a logistical nightmare , her packed trains hopelessly snarled and delayed in an attempt to make good her threats to punish the Serbs , while rushing to check the feared Russian advance from the east . Exhorted by her ally France to strike quickly , Russia , meanwhile , was struggling to rouse her huge and disorganized forces . While the infantry tried to pull itself together , mounted Cossacks and cavalry reconnaissance units were starting to the front . To avoid the nightmare of the 1904 mobilization , there was also a temporary prohibition on the sale of vodka . Soon enough , though , the vodka would be flowing , and the czar 's forces would be trampling fields huge for harvest , dressed in sweltering woolen uniforms designed for parades and expecting , as most nations did , a short , healthy bloodlettingthat would be over before the leaves fell . Consoling Ottoline that day , Russell felt more rage than sorrow at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imbecility and race hatred . Few generals were as prepared for their war as Russell was for his . His abortive , end-of-the-world Forstice had just been a prelude to this ; if anything , Russell would come to find it oddly prophetic . Sitting beside Ottoline , he felt more resolute and incisive than he had in more than a year . Like a deus ex machina , the war had come to lift him out of the doldrums left in the wake of Wittgenstein 's criticisms . And in a perverseway , it was a philosopher 's dream . Civilization was about to murderitself , and when it did , Russell felt he would throw off the last mooringsand create a better system , one not only more rational but also more just and humane . For all his certainty about his own course , Russell had no such epiphany about Ottoline that first day of the war . Their love just petered away , hastened by world events  --  and by D.D. , who threw her arms around Russell 's neck one night when he opened the door. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war and living in London , having moved the week before from Mrs. Dood 's to a little flat in the South End . Oh , dearest darling , said D.D. , holding him out to look at him . Thank God you 're all right ! I 've been looking for you for weeks ! Why did n't you tell me you were moving ? You 're not in trouble , are you ? Of course not , he said , drawing back . Nothing 's the matter . D.D . was frantic . Well , then , why did n't you leave word where I could find you ? Her eyes watered over . I 've been so furious  --  so betrayed ! I went to Cambridge  --  I even went to your landlady , that Dood woman . She said you 'd disappeared . She told you that ? He smacked his hands together with mock fury . The liar ! The witch hates me . I specifically told her to give you my address . On the verge of a hysterical outburst , D.D . faced him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her eyes were dilated , and her face was contorted in a way he had never seen . She was n't just mean , D.D . hissed . She was downright evil about it . She screamed at me , then threatened to call a constable . But I fixed her ! Boy oh boy , did I fix that bitch but good by the time I left ! Fixed that yappy dog of hers , too . Well , well , he offered anxiously , trying to calm her down . The important thing is , you 've found me . Sit down . When did you arrive , then ? Saturday ? But you did receive my letters  --  I sent three . No ? But of course you know about the overseas mails being disrupted , the submarinesand so forth . D.D . was n't buying this . Fixing him with the same unfocused glare that must have curdled Mrs. Dood , she screamed : LIAR ! You rotten , mealy-mouthed liar ! I did n't get anything . Nothing ? Vainly he kept up his patter , trapped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bags . D.D. , meanwhile , was pacing , sniffing for a rival and staring at the floral walls of this hovel that clearly had been let with no thought of them . Cursed luck . Russell did n't even have a spare quid to pay the cabman . Eyeing him with shame , D.D . pushed some notes into the man 's hand , then slammed the door , bawling , This place is a goddamned dump ! He was all caution and solicitude at first , washing out a cracked cup and lighting the sputtering gas ring to make tea . At first she turned up her nose , but then with a scowl she gulped the tea down . He saw that her hands were trembling , the nails deeply chewed . He thought there wasp276something odd about her looks , too , then realized it was her hair : a still more severe slice of bangs , self-inflicted , nunnery style . And then suddenlyD.D. brightened , flashing a minxing look above the upturned cup that made his bowels churn . Hoping to avert an even more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but she spoke first . Darling , she said , quite as if nothing had happened . We really ca n't stay here , you know . Mom and Dad will be arriving next month . Not that we have to get married right away , of course , but we ca n't very well have them find us here . For some seconds he stared at her , unable to decide whether this was guile or simple lunacy . Then , as gently as he could he said , Doris  --  D.D. , I 'm afraid there 's been a frightful misunderstanding . It 's true I invited you to visit , but I never even remotely suggested that we should get married . Why , as yet I 'm not even legally divorced . The cup whizzed past his ear . Histrionics and tears . Fearing suicide or a lawsuit , he agreed to let her stay the night , then made the fatal mistake of coupling with her , not just once but several times . His second mistake , caused by remorse for the first , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Requiem for Father Flye . Gripping her knees , D.D . watched with relish as he read her story , another of the Penelope Cycle , as she now called ' it . This tale found the young ingenue in a convent , where she is despoiled by a philandering Jesuit , that hypocrite theologian and scholar of the Virgin Birth , Father Flye . But Penelope gets her revenge . After locking the unsuspecting priest in his confessional , she kneels and , in a disguised voice , recounts their sins before naming their penance  --  " Death ! Death ! Death ! "  --  hacking open her wrists , then slashing through the screen while Father Flye howls and beats on the door . Russell did n't even pretend to finish it . Rising up , he said accusingly : How dare you threaten me ! Are you such a hypocrite ? Who seduced whom here ? D.D . reared back as if she 'd been slapped . Then she started crying , deep sucking breaths followed by loud moans of rage that nearly drove him from the room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , gasping to bring up the words : Maybe I 'm just trying to get your lousy attention . God knows , I do n't expect your sympathy  --  you do n't feel sympathy for anybody , Father Flye ! Oh , that 's you , all right . First you steal others blind , then ease your conscience by writing another book or something . At heart you 're nothing but a goddamned weasel !  |p277For  nearly an hour , he blankly endured this abuse , hoping that she would tire of it and leave for good . But she refused to give up . With the least kindness from him , she seemed to think everything was on again , while with the least scowl or ill-chosen word , she acted as if she would kill herself . Two days later , at the end of his wits , he finally called Ottoline , imploringher to talk to the girl . D.D . was only too happy to take her case to Ottoline , who was pained to see that the young American was far more attractive than Russell had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love , D.D . told Ottoline everything , calmly explaining , with the eerie plausibility of fantasy , how only she , D.D. , could " save " poor Bertie . Then came the kicker : You know , D.D . confessed , I was so jealous when Bertie told me about your spiritual friendship . That was all I ever wanted with a man . She gave a windy grin . I 'll bet you 'll think I 'm awfully impertinent for asking this . I mean , it 's absolutely none of my business . But  --  well , did n't you ever think of having a more , uh , physical relationship with Bertie ? Well , no , said Ottoline , trying to pick herself off the floor . No , I suppose I always wanted to keep our little friendship on that high spiritual plane . Oh ! D.D . looked positively transported . You 're so very lucky ! Oh , I know , my dear , I know .. . In the end , it was out of sympathy for D.D . that Ottoline made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  if only temporarily . As for Russell , he was completely unrepentant  --  defiantly so  --  when Ottoline exposed his deceits . A year before , he would have begged her forgiveness , but now he just walked away , furious to be bothered with this nonsense when he was busy with weightier matters . Ottoline found his strength and distance appalling . Within a matter of weeks , the war had completely transformed him . And all the while , their relationship was undergoing a similar transformation , existing on less , then on hardly anything at all . D.D . remained in London , where Russell heard from reliable sources that she had been jailed for prostitution and hospitalized after a suicide attempt . Violent , disheveled , bizarre , she would periodically turn up to plague him at rallies or meetings , once embarrassing him so deeply that he threatened legal action . D.D . was not an entirely isolated case : Russell encountered many confused young women like her at the height of the war . Starved for grand feelings and a cause , working long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they followed him like enervated ghosts . And , just as lost as any of them , Russell had them  --  uncontrollably and indiscriminately , one after another . Then , two years later , in the fall of 1916 , Russell awoke in the middle of the night to what sounded like the squalling of a cat in heat . It was D.D. , sobbing outside his door . He was already a man besieged . German zeppelins were bombing London , and the police had him under surveillance for his activities against the war . Almost the moment he heard her , he jumped out of bed , breathinginto his hand as he listened to the drunken scrabble of her nails on the door . For ten minutes she sobbed and pleaded before agreeing to leave him alone forever if he would just open the door and listen for five minutes . He set his watch on the table , unfastened the latch and gave her those five minutes . Had his flat been the last refuge on earth , he would n't have given her a minute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her off . Thank God your time is up ! And with that he shoved her out the door . The Oracle of Fort MyersAT THIS TIME Russell was in the process of building his Utopia , a world where man 's acquisitive , warlike impulses would be replaced by creative ones and where men and women would rule and love as equals . Yet Russellhimself remained an Old World product , completely unsuited for citizenship in his new order . Columbus only discovered the New World  --  never did he foresee living in his own creation . Russell was then out of step with almost everyone . Even his staunchest supporters did n't know where to pigeonhole him politically . He was n't a Fabian or a socialist , was n't religious , antivivisectionist or vegetarian  --  why , he was n't even a true pacifist , a breed he generally found to be Sunday school types whose grand schemes reminded him of fleas proposingto build a pyramid . His attitude toward the war had evolved slowly . Dead set against the war at first , he then decided that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choice but to fight for an early victory , though not a brutal one . Until then  --  or rather , until England was out of danger  --  he said he would re/frain from directly criticizing the government . Instead , he would hold his fire until hostilities ceased , at which point he wanted a full-scale investigation of the events that had led to war , followed by a public forum on how civilizationmight be reordered to avoid future wars . For the first two years , he largely kept his word about speaking out against the government 's war policy , but this did n't stop him from speakingout about the politics and impulses of war  --  and the need for a just peace once the war was over . Taking leave from Trinity , he joined several political parties , organizing , speaking and writing a stream of articles and pamphlets with titles such as " War , the Offspring of Fear , " " Why Nations Love War " and " Is a Permanent Peace Possible ? " But his position changed dramatically in 1916 , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only as an unlawful infringement of liberty but as a clear indication that the war , after two years of butchery and stalemate , was a moral , human and economic impossibility . He joined the radical No-Conscription Fellowship and began an active campaign against the government 's war policy . The British authoritiesdid n't know what to do with him . As a writer and speaker , he was too effective to ignore , yet he was too prominent to simply be jailed . As for bringing legal injunctions against him , this carried considerable risk , since it would offer him precisely what he wanted : martyrdom and a public forum from which he could mock the government and espouse his views . The government was far from stupid in this regard . Indeed , they went to such lengths to ignore him that they jailed six men for distributing an anticonscription leaflet that he had written . Russell would n't have this . To shame the authorities into action , he sent The Times a letter declaring himself the author of the pamphlet and chiding the government for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no choice but take him to court , and he made them regret it , ridiculing the government 's policies and making the periwigged lord mayor who led the proceeding look like a fool before a delighted throng of reporters . Convicted , he was fined one hundred pounds , which he promptly refused to pay , saying that they would have to jail him . The lord mayor was n't falling into that trap . Instead , he decreed , under Defense Regulations , that the defendant 's hooks and furniture would be seized and auctioned . This was distressing but it was only a slap compared to what happened next : because Russell had been convicted of a crime  --  at that a relatively minor political crime  --  the council of Trinity , led by the militant McTaggart , dismissed him , in spite of a petition in support of him signed by twenty-two dons ,  |p280ranging  from the warlike Whitehead to the anticonscriptionist Moore . Moore even published a scathing letter in Cambridge Magazine , thankingthe rectors for their patriotism , courtesy and liberality of mind , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Love Thine Enemies was plainly subversive . This sacking was a deep wound for Russell , a bitter betrayal of all he held sacred . Smelling blood , the government , meanwhile , grew bolder in its campaign to isolate and discredit him . After he was offered a lectureshipat Harvard , where he thought he might have even greater impact against the war , the authorities revoked his passport , saying that he was liable to make seditious statements . Then , after he made a successful speaking tour of the mines and steel mills in South Wales , they further curbed his freedom , invoking a rule that barred suspected spies from industrialareas . This was a serious blunder : no one , not even Russell 's worst enemies , seriously believed he was disloyal , and overnight he was transformed into an object of sympathy , with editorials appearing in his favor , along with a corresponding swing in public support . And he fought back . In those areas he could not enter , he wrote blistering epistles to the faithful , while in those areas he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condemnation of the war , the government and the generals , who , he said , would gladly butcher sixty thousand men in a morningfor a few blood-soaked yards . No one could have been more warlike in his opposition to war . In his own rising hatred and frustration , in the increasing pitch of his rhetoric , Russell even began to exhibit a certain sadistic streak . Wherever he went now , there would be a police inspector shadowing him , taking notes . Masterfully mugging for the mob , Russell would unfailingly introduce the poor man , then subject him to the most humiliating ridicule , verbally whipping him as a proxy for his enemies as the delighted crowd stamped and jeered . Inspector , he would say , I have for our most benevolent government a modest proposal . In the interest of greater efficiency , let us end the war today and divide our young men into three groups , killing the first group outright , maiming and blinding the second and driving the third mad with noise and fear . Or better yet , let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What do you think , Inspector ? Tut , tut , old boy , do speak up ! Will you clap us all in irons ? What do you think , man ? By God , he knew now how to get their blood up  --  how to jerk them to their feet and cow the heckler . Nothing was more intoxicating than the feeling of standing atop that whirlwind . Why , there were nights when ,  |p281with  but a word from him , the crowds would have wrecked the hall and followed him into the streets for a night 's rampage . This , he thought , was the exaltation Christ must have known during his last days on earth . At long , long last , he was speaking out , and speaking freely . At long last , the opposition movement was growing into a chorus heard throughout England . But most of all he heard his own strident voice , and in his black periods he alternated between feeling utterly deluded or like a vulturous war profiteer  --  a Krupp or a Vickers  --  advancing his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could see was only widening . His followers told him he was in danger but this he found oddly consoling , like his periodic thoughts of suicide . And how easy it would have been , in his excitement and weariness , to martyr himself for this noble cause . Martyrdom was easy ; it was change  --  changing one 's fundamental being  --  this was what was hard . In this respect , Russell saw himself , in the later days of the war , less as a revolutionary than as a sort of regenerative creature , a lobster that gladly tears off an appendage in a predator 's jaws , knowing that it can drag itself off to grow another claw or feeler , howeverstunted . Garsington Manor , Ottoline 's new five-hundred-acre estate outside Oxford , was Russell 's refuge at this time , even if Ottoline herself was not . Philip had bought the estate early in 1913 on the advice of their doctor , who felt country air was essential for both Ottoline 's and Julian 's delicate health . However , it was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been redecorated according to Ottoline 's extravagant taste , that the Morrells finally took up residence . Sequestered there with her jesters and freeloaders , the rapier intellects and vaunted opinions , Ottoline had little reason to pine for London . London was soon flocking to Garsington to escape blackouts , queues , food shortages and other lesser wartime barbarities . Before long , there was a stream of genteel visitors who sometimes stayed for weeks at a stretch , and some , like Lytton Strachey , who never seemed to leave , ridiculingOttoline behind her back while partaking of her eerie , seemingly bottomless generosity . Gone now were a good many of her young men , lost from month to month in places like Virny Ridge and Ypres , the Dardanelles and Somme . Every day they would read the long death rolls in the newspaper , sometimestwo and three full pages listing those who had gone down . Everybodyhad lost someone , and it had its effect on Ottoline , who became more extreme and a little more desperate , crossing that zone from demi/mondaine to grand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Within a matter of months , she had quite transformed herself . Scarved as Isadora , gloriously oversparkling , then flinty , Ottoline would hold court , duly accepting the homage of the young men 's pecking kisses . The shy gawk who , as a girl , had prayed while her brother , the duke , gave his beastly black masques  --  the girl still visible at times only a year ago  --  had been banished . Suddenly , Ottoline had a reputation to protect , and what had been charmingly naive and eccentric about her had hardened into a conscious style . Bitchy , flamboyant , preposterous , she was now a practiced oddity , bristling with vague ideas , impressions , gossip . She smoked Russian cigarettes and sometimes dressed as a Gypsy or a shepherdess , carrying a crook tied with ribbons and leading a pack of pugs . And like all of them , she was deeply afraid , hoarding culture and beauty in the way others did soap or matches . Set behind hedges and rectangular gardens , the house was built of gray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Italian in feeling , with a triptych of tall gables and arched-and-leaded windows . Below the house was a reflecting pool with pink marble piers and brass gorgon spouts , which required some now unobtainable pumping apparatus to purge it of the green scum that choked it and bred mosquitoes . Ottoline installed marble statues of eyeless Greek gods around its edges and set peacocks loose to roam the brick garden paths . And there , under the great ilex tree , her guests would gather  --  mostly young men in Panama hats who sat under lacquered parasols with their knees hiked to their chins , talking a mongrel tongue of Italian , French and English and penningverses oft inspired by the chisled loins of the eyeless divinities by the pool . Garsington was their sanctuary once conscription started . Giving no thought to the enormous expense and complications involved , Ottoline convinced Philip to use his pull to open the manor as a farm where conscientiousobjectors could do alternate farmwork . Her young men were not nearly as grateful as they should have been , what to have been spared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gimpy sergeant just back from the front . The more idealistic ones read Tolstoy and worked , more or less . As for the other Boy Blues , they napped , groused and dawdled , slapping flies and goosing one another in the new-mown hay . At dusk , they could be seen with their rakes and hoes , trudging home for their glass of sherry behind the manor farmworkers who did the real work , keeping their mouths shut for small bribes when the army came hunting for slackers.  |p283Russell  often went to Garsington to recuperate . Now that he was sexuallyout of the picture , he got on quite admirably with Philip , and passingwell with Ottoline . Russell rarely stayed in the main house . Instead , Ottoline put him in a little guest house of clabber-colored stucco where Lamb 's self-portrait now hung above the mantel , a shrine to another of her lost loves ( Lamb , a stretcher-bearer , was bogging bodies through the Somme ) . Russell paid no attention to the portrait . Like a desert hermit in his cell , he remained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tracts aimed at a total revision of society , beginning with love and marriage . Ottoline said the overhaul ought to begin with himself . Sometimes , to goad him , she would eye him wonderingly , as if he were a hopeless case , saying , Poor , poor Bertie . Dear me , where will we find him a good wife ? Retaliating for this , Russell would himself muse aloud : Now , where on Garsington shall we find an able young man for Ottoline ? Obscurely , each thought  --  or fondly hoped  --  the other was sliding into musty celibacy . In their ability to bite and bicker , they were like an unhappy middle-aged couple . One afternoon , as they were sitting in the garden , he looked at her and said , Pity , your hair is going gray . Pierced , she replied , Pity , yours has quite gone . Ottoline did n't succeed in finding Russell a wife , but she did give him a temporary ally in D. H. Lawrence , introducing the two men at Garsingtonearly in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man standing in the garden , Ottoline said , Now , do be patient . Lawrence is a poet , not a logician . He can be opinionated but he really is a dear , lovely man , so gentle and honest , most passionate . Now , her , she continued , nodding toward Lawrence'sbig-boned wife , Frieda , who was playing croquet with several men on the flat green below . She 's your poster Hun . A baroness in case you ca n't tell . Lawrence is absurdly vain about her lineage  --  loves to use her crested stationery . Understandable for a collier 's son , I suppose . Frieda 's voice sounded , at a distance , like the barking of a large , hoarse dog . She soon pegged out , she did . Laughing , brandishing her mallet , she stepped on one red ball and busted the one abutting it , crying out triumphantly to the vanquished , angular men . Ottoline , like a guide , continued : Four years ago , she abandoned her husband and three children to run away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't I ? You do n't know the power he has over people . She took right up with him , abandoned everything . Oh , but then she thought better of it  --  the children , I mean . She was a miserable creature then , a madwoman , completely inconsol/able . Several times she tried to see the children , but her husband was shattered  --  would n't let her near them . She 's the stuff of Greek tragedy , a Clytemnestra , that one . I do n't know how Lawrence bears it . At times , he goes quite mad with her unhappiness . And for all his sex talk , they 've had no children . Ottoline sniffed . She has only him to mother now  --  murder 's more like it . They fight like cats and dogs . Not here , thank God , Philip would n't tolerate it . David Garnett told me he once saw Lawrence haul her back by the hair and strike her full in the face . Dreadful screaming . David thought he would kill her . Frieda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sneered at him . And then  --  Ottoline shrugged and brightened  --  an hour later all was lovey-dovey again ! Is n't that the maddest thing you 've ever heard ? And you think I ought to meet him ? asked Russell dubiously . Oh , absolutely , said Ottoline , walking on . Lawrence has quite changed my life . But he has had a bad time of it lately , what with The Rainbow being banned and no money . You know , no one will publish him now  --  they do n't dare . And because of her , the police have him down as a possibleGerman sympathizer . He hates England now , he 's fearfully bitter . He wants to escape and found a colony in America . Now the alchemist in Ottoline emerged as she said , I do think there 's a similarity in your societal aspirations . For England and the world , I mean . And Lawrence does so very much admire your work and your courage to speak out . He told me so . This pricked Russell 's vanity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reputation . Already , he had read , and much admired , Lawrence'spoetry . He had likewise been impressed with the opening of Sons and Lovers when Ottoline had put the book in his hands that morning . And Russell did want an ally of the visionary kind , as opposed to the rather laborious idealogues he found around him these days . With his hands stuffed in his pockets , Lawrence , meanwhile , was pickingdown the rain-soaked path , intently checking the spring 's progress , the little stubs of green underfoot and the rude red buds protruding from the branches . For a suspected German sympathizer , Lawrence was not exercising much caution . Even his only suit was a provocation : a Rhenish cut , the color and texture of oatmeal , with too many pockets . Ottoline said he was still getting over a respiratory infection , and he looked it . He was a small , stooped , sick-looking man , not much over thirty , with reddishhair and mustache , weary red eyes , a large jaw and bony hands and wrists . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accent , and his eyes quickened when he saw Ottoline with Russell in tow . Thep285matchmaker had left nothing to chance : Ottoline had also given Lawrencea thorough briefing on Russell . Ottoline did not stay long after her introduction . Having lit the fuse , she quickly excused herself , saying that she had to speak to the gardener . There was awkwardness and a sense of electricity then as the two men walked along , probing each other with small talk about the spring and the beauty of Garsington . Lawrence was the first to chafe at this mannered minuet . With a hungry , conspiring look , he suddenly said , Well , now . To the business at hand . Business ? demurred Russell . That 's right , said Lawrence with a nod . I see your face , Bertie Russell . It tells the story . You look tired , man , bone tired , like a fox run across three counties . I 'm another fox  --  aye , a little red fox , panting , with my slack ribs showing . And do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you must beware the pack , man , the pack ! Alone they are nothing , but as a pack  --  good God , they 'll hound you forever ! Russell was as struck by Lawrence 's sudden vehemence as by the image he had chosen : lately , Russell also saw himself as a man pursued . Still , it was somewhat galling to be lectured by a stranger , at that a man some thirteen years his junior . But Russell was even more disturbed to find himself oddly afraid of this frail , clearly frightened man . Lawrence seemed to see clear through him , smiling as if to say , You can fool them , Ih'rtie Russell , but you ca n't fool me with your mental dodges and ringthe-rosies . Russell , making a mental mark , thought , This man is dangerous . But as they walked on , he found himself drawn to this menacing quality , instinctively feeling that if he made peace with the danger around him , the danger might spare him its worst . And soon he felt close to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Lawrence described the humiliation of submitting to an army physical the week before , of being forced to stand stripped in a line of men while a scabby little doctor with a fag end dangling fingered his groin . Lawrence felt he 'd been raped . What right has the state to poke my loins and peer up my arse as if I were a stud bull ? he said . And then to tell me I 'm not fit ! For lovemaking Pin fit , but not for their filthy war . Lawrence spat with disgust . Dead men , all of them . May their brains burst and their black hearts rot . Russell found this chilling . And hard as Lawrence was on soldiers , he was no less damning of ( ; . O.s when they later came upon a field where some of Ottoline 's charges were working . Two digging a drainage ditchp286were standing on their shovels while another tried without much effort to pry up a stone . A fourth was off picking flowers . With a savage look , Lawrence turned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as these ? Better men are already lying fallow in Flanders . These are unclean . God , how I loathe them , these lilied , fagging public school boys , these lying , foolish cynics . Have you ever listened to their prattle ? Blind to truth and the sacredness of life , they are , and they will laugh at me ! These are n't men or even boys  --  these are bloody fetuses . Let the cannon consume them , I say . They 're all done for  --  aye , and England , too . Russell had never heard anyone curse with such cold-blooded malice . With a queasy look , he said to Lawrence , Do n't you think you 're being a trifle harsh ? I care for sodomy no more than'you , but they are still human beings . They deserve to live as much as anyone . Living men deserve to live ! Lawrence shot back . These are dead . Giving him a measured look , Russell said , Well , if these are indeed dead , then we do n't need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his tone accusing as he said , Do n't waste your philosopher 's cleverness on me ! Let these drones be killed off and be done with it . The war , you know , is entirely biological  --  Malthusian . Do you seriously believe that all this evolution business , all these ages of lizards and man-apes and bloodthirsty life , were meant to lead to Christ 's dying on Calvary and our salvation ? I do n't , I do n't for a second ! I believe it has led to this  --  to decay and death and more death . And thank God , I say . Maggots eat only dead tissue  --  it 's a dying world 's way of purging itself of dead matter . You , Bertie Russell , you ought to occupy yourself building the new immanent world rather than saving this dying one . And you must speak the truth  --  I mean the actual truth of blood knowledge  --  and hang the corruption of this mentalizing nerve consciousness . Here , Russell lost his patience . Blood knowledge ? Nerve consciousness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carotids flared up like two little asps . I mean the truth of the blood ! Blood consciousness  --  instinct as opposed to febrile nerve consciousness and useless intellectualizing . Why do you stare at me ? You make me feel fumbling , with your looks . No , I am not being logical , I am being truthful . And if I am not logical , then you as a philosopher must tell me where I do not make myself clear  --  But at this Lawrence 's voice cracked , and he started coughing in deep , gurgling hacks , so that he had to lean against a tree . I 'm all right , he said , smiling almost pleasurably when Russell startedp287to pat him on the back . Shyly , Russell stuffed his hand back in his pocket and slowly backed against the tree opposite . Lawrence was looking at him , just looking with the profound innocence of one human being cominginto focus with another . Lawrence 's eyes were like circles in a pool of water , circles marking the spot where a chaste stone had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pool ; he wanted to look away , yet he could n't break from this gaze , which now shone with an almost unfathomable goodness . And then , just when Russell thought he could stand it no more , Lawrence twisted up his nose and laughed . A big brazen boy 's laugh . A hurdle had been passed . Beneath it , thought Russell , the man has a sense of humor . Yes , at least he could laugh . Points of light stood on the new leaves unfolding . On the hillsides , flossy new grass was rippling in the sun . Suddenly Russell felt quite pleased with his young friend . He brushed off the sodden cuffs of his trousers and retied his wet shoelaces , then stood smiling , indicating that he was ready . Lawrence was still eyeing him playfully , on the verge of another laugh . Picking up a limber stick and flipping it around in his hand , Lawrence said : But you are not dead , Bertie Russell , nor am I. And we should n't be quarreling when we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Come , let us walk some more . Look now , the primroses are out  --  let us he gay a while and each wear one as a sign in our buttonholes . There , now , he said , threading the stem through the hole . Look down into the flower 's throat  --  look as you would smell . Have you seen anything so fine ? You know , said Lawrence , swinging his coat over his arm . You must tell me your philosophy , and I will tell you mine . I know I am foolish , truly I am . But still I love this coming life of ours , and I swear I speak the truth . Truly , I do . Ottoline 's match had caught fire . Later , when she asked Russell what he thought of Lawrence , he said : He 's most wonderfully pure , absolutely passionate and intuitive . I felt as if he saw right through me . Lawrence was no less impressed . Coming round to him later , like a nectaring bee , Ottoline was delighted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you said , and he will be useful in our new world . He will he our Zoroaster . Only I feel he needs seasoning . He is too hidehoundby mind . Yet I feel certain we shall swear Blutsbruderschaft . And I told him we must collaborate on a philosophy to rebuild the world . Ip288shall speak about immortality and he shall teach ethics . The poet 's eyestwinkled . And after we have changed the world , we shall go to America and start a jolly colony in Florida , with you as our queen . With me as queen , asked Ottoline fatuously . But what about Frieda ? Frieda ? Lawrence thought for a moment . Why , Frieda shall be our Oracle at Fort Myers . Yes , he said , nodding , I think Fort Myers will be the eye of our new world . TWICE MORE Lawrence and Russell met at Garsington . Letters were exchanged , and then the two men began to seriously discuss this program in which Russell would lecture on ethics and social reconstruction and Lawrence on immortality and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snags . Lawrence , Russell quickly realized , was not one to be bothered with trifling details or practicalities . Rather , he wanted to change the world by decree . He seemed to feel he had only to snap his fingers , had only to write the words , and the reality would magically appear . Everything was Let there be ! and We must ! Grandly he would say , Let there be an end to this economic thing . We must burst the bonds of this accursed money that enslaves us . Let industryand communications be nationalized , then every man and every woman , well or ill , will have his wages and that will be that . Democracy , on the other hand , was wrong . The collier 's son had no faith whatsoever in the wisdom of the working man . Liberty , equality and fraternity he called the Three-Fanged Serpent . Rather , Lawrence said there must be an elected aristocracy led by a Caesar . Or better yet , a Supreme Man and a Supreme Woman , with man dictating the economic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spiritual marriage , not corrupt state marriage . The key was Woman . Woman must be the cruciblethrough which Man must strive for his essential blood being , strugglingup through her like a drowning man fighting for air . Russell was alternately repelled and fascinated by these ideas , but he nevertheless saw them as an antidote to his own rationalism , which he found increasingly unreliable in the more mystical realms where he now liked to dwell . Not since Wittgenstein had Russell encountered one whop289sent such shivers down his spine . Yet while Russell thought Wittgenstein correct in most cases , he often found Lawrence wrong  --  wrong and faintly terrifying in his sweeping indictments of humanity . There was something savage and paradoxical about Lawrence , this frightened man who inspired fear ; like Wittgenstein , his knack for exposinganxieties and weaknesses in others was preternatural . Lawrence told Russell that he was blind as a newt , that spiritually he did n't know himself in the least . Lawrence told him that he must be entirely cast forth from the fold of society , that , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bursting forth like a babe into the world . Russell hungered for this transformation . Already he longed to cease being such a public creature , cut adrift without wife or children . Russell badly wanted the new Canaan that Lawrence promised , but he balked . Standing at the brink of that frontier , he shrunk into his lobster self , paralyzed by the sheer nullity of too much . And Lawrence , for all his passion , could be stifling . It was always the same litany . London was falling . England was dead . Englishmen were dead . And then , just when Lawrence had pushed Russell to the edge with his hatred and nullity , he would reveal the warmth of sanity , in the way he could sing and be gay , or in the humble devotion with which he could knead bread or fall to his knees to scrub a floor . What Russell found intolerable was Lawrence 's muddled thinking . For God 's sake , Lawrence , he would plead . In almost a single breath , you tell me that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be both republic and kingdom , and that London has fallen yet must be pulled down . For once and for all , which way will you have it ? But rant as he might , Russell could not pin him down . Lawrence meant what he meant , he contradicted what he meant , he stuck by what he meant and revised what he meant . And then , hearing the cock crow , Lawrence said it was time . It was time to write down their program . Or rather , he said that at this stage it most depended on Russell  --  heir to Plato and Heraclitus  --  to lay the foundation of their coming Utopia , which he would call Rananim . Russelldid as directed : he drew up their preamble . Moving relentlessly from one in , stitution to another , Russell tried to show that the very institutions that seem to make society work  --  the state , property , the church andrriage  --  lead instead to world suicide . Russell was bold , even sensationalistic , in his attack , saying that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The symptoms differed but the disease was always the same . He said that states existed only to enforce internal peace andp290wage external wars , that marriage was to enforce fidelity , morality to protect property and God to justify murder in his name . But Lawrence said it was no good . No , no , he scolded . Your approach is much too negative . Negative ? Russell was incredulous . You accuse me of being negative ? I do , Lawrence insisted . You must n't waste precious time saying what is wrong . You must instead say what is and must be . Say what we 've agreed on  --  that acquisitive , murderous impulses myst be replaced with the creative life essence and that instead of acting from self , man must act from an essential sense of truth . You must get in the positive idea that every living community is a living state . That the fundamental passion in man is for wholeness of movement , unanimity of purpose and oneness of construction . That this is the whole principle of construction . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , bandying that word again . And what have you said ? All is one ! Life is a " unity ! Abracadabra ! Russell sat staring at him , trying to soften his tone . Please , put yourself in my position . How am I to make anything out of this ? And how , for that matter , am I to make it intelligible to the broader public ? Lawrence was indomitable . But you do n't understand ! The point is not to make it popular ! Oh , God , do not make it popular . We can not waste our breath on the mob . We need to get to the root , to chop the snake off at the head ! To kill the great falsity of subjectivism . God help us ! scoffed Russell . Now , it 's not just truth but subjectivism ! And everything you 've said  --  it 's all profoundly , impossibly subjective ! You mistake your imagination for truth . Aye , said Lawrence , waving his finger . And you , mon frere , fail to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to frame even the opening bars of this overture . And then one night , not long after a zeppelin 's bombs struck an orphanage , a mob armed with clubs and stones burst in the hall where Russell was lecturing and rushed the stage . Get out ! Russell ordered . Out ! All of you ! Russell was determined to stand his ground , but fortunately three associatesmanaged to drag him off before the mob enveloped him . As it was , Russell barely escaped , with bruises and a throat deeply gashed by someone 's nails . To his shame , he was among the luckiest . Sixteen others were hurt , four seriously , including one man who nearly lost an eye . After meeting with the NCF leaders , Russell decided to go into seclusionand stop speaking for a few weeks . He and Lawrence were walking through the London Zoo when Russell explained his decision . Lawrence ,  |p291ill  for the last month , had grown a scraggly beard that reminded Russell of a swarm of red ants . Nonsense , man , Lawrence insisted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop speaking now . Good God , do n't you see ? The time is ripe , the crowd 's ugliness is a good sign ! They 're ready to revolt . Why , with only a few words from you , they would do so right now ! Russell was incensed . And do what ? Hail you as their Caesar ? Look ! he said , pulling down his collar . Do you see their claws on my neck ? Revolt ? All they 're ripe for is murder . Lawrence nodded . But they would pull down the bloody bunch over us now . Then the war would end and we all could truly begin to live . To live , Bertie . And a word , a word from you is all it would take . Are n't you sick ? Are n't you sick to death of it ? Death would be better . It 's time , I say . You must cast aside all fear and do it  --  do it for freedom 's sake . Russell stopped short and faced him . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you can tell the people . You know the mood better than I. You know the word . You , of all people , have the common touch that I lack . Well , go on , man ! That magical word from you will make it so . Lawrence 's hot eyes bulged . With a look of rage , he admitted , I ca n't speak to crowds  --  you know this . Russell waved him off . Then do n't speak this nonsense to me . Wait ! ordered Lawrence , rushing to catch up . God damn you , wait ! I 'll not wait , remonstrated Russell . I have nothing more to say to youtoday . Russell hoped this would end the matter , but Lawrence kept following , coughing and trying to catch his breath . They passed a clown and a man selling nuts , some children with their nanny . Lawrence was bearing down on him ; Russell even wondered if he might physically attack him . But just as Russell was about to confront him , Lawrence streaked by and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a large male baboon . The ape , bent over with his back turned , whipped around with a hiss . Huh ! cried Lawrence . He spat again , and the ape bounded back , the hair on his spine bristling as Lawrence stared into his hooded eyes , intoniug : Dear , vile monkey . . . Pretty , pretty monkey .. . A screech and a shower of dust and pizzled straw as Lawrence lunged with his umbrella . Whirling around , Lawrence flicked the umbrella up like a pointer , the better to show his fellow Utopian the coiling beast , the venomous red eyes.  |p292Look  at him , Bertie . So much like you , that hideous aggressor , that savage kaiser lurking beneath . Hah ! Lawrence rang his umbrella along the bars , then thrust it at the fanged jaws . This also is you , Bertie , lusting to jab and strike like a man with a bayonet , saying , This is for ultimate peace . Why do n't you own to your nature ? What is the use of you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another ? Give me no more of your lies , moaning about goodness and humanity . You are the enemy of mankind  --  spiteful and murderous , filled with bestial , repressed desires . Hah , monkey ! Would n't you love to sink your teeth into my pretty neck ? Hah ! Hah ! But then the blood flooded Lawrence 's face , and he began to hack and wheeze . Russell made no effort to help him . Hunched and gasping , Lawrenceeyed him with unspeakable loathing , then lurched off , slipping like a shade through the unquiet trees . That night , during still another blackout , Russell decided that Lawrence was right about him , and as he sat there in his tiny flat , listening to bombs crumple in the distance , he wished that one might fall on him . It was his worst depression since that day on a beach near Ramsgate the spring previous , when , as he stood looking out to sea , with the surf lightly rushingin and not a cloud in the sky , he had heard  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't thunder at all but shock waves emanating from the massed siege guns in Artois , nearly a hundred miles away . But Russell survived that night and he survived Lawrence , who a week later sent him a letter apologizing for his outburst , saying that in quarreling with him , he had been quarreling with something deep in himself . They never did swear Blutsbruderschaft . Instead , their friendship struggled along briefly before ending in a bitterness that lasted all the rest of their lives . Before the final break , however , Lawrence wrote Russell a letter saying that he hoped Russell would have the courage to stop being a savant and an ego and would concentrate instead on being just a creature . Lawrence also said once more that Russell would never reach the unknown until he had sustained a deep and abiding union with a woman . Anything less , he said , was mere sensation seeking  --  masturbation . Russell resumed speaking . Later , to Lawrence 's disgust , he even deliveredthe program of lectures he had outlined . The fashionable and humanethinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greeted his ideas with tremendous excitement . But these people , as Russellwell knew , were the elect minority . For the rest of England his ideas hardly existed , or did only as very watered-down slogans . And nothingp293really changed . Not humanity , nor himself , nor even the women who gravitated to him , who seemed alike only in their native unhappiness and eventual dissatisfaction with him . Later that summer , though , his bad spell broke when he met Lady Constance Malleston , a twenty-year-old actress who went by her stage name , Colette . Russell liked her naturalness and diction . Slender , elegant and well educated , she had waved auburn hair and , that rare thing in England , perfect teeth . Russell had seen her at several meetings before asking an acquaintance to introduce them . Colette told him that she had joined the NCF the year before , shortly after her brother was killed in France . Of course , my husband 's a C.O. , too , she added carelessly . Russell must have shown his disappointment , because she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understudy to Miles Keegan . He 's in Scotland now . We 're both quite independent . At dinner later , she insisted on paying for her part of the meal , and he , owing to his pinched circumstances , reluctantly agreed . Afterward , they drifted outside . It was a warm , clear , moonless evening , and London was nervously expecting another zeppelin raid , the third in three nights . Nine people had died the night before in fires and explosions . The tabloids were filled with headlines like FLAMING FIANCEE and HERO HOUND and stories like that of doughty little Arthur , the messenger boy who pulled old Mrs. Birme from her burning house . Dropping as much as four thousandpounds of high explosives and incendiary bombs , and flying at heights that often required their crews to suck pure oxygen from rubber nozzles , the airships were portrayed by the press as infernal Jules Verne machines driven by goggled Teutonic insects clad in black leather . For more than a year , the Germans had been making raids farther and farther inland in preparation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and with deep reluctance , that the kaiser had given his permission to bomb the city , and only with the proviso that they spare historic landmarks and , above all , cousin Georgie 's palace . For a month the Germans had been making successful raids , and now the German navy was in on it , competing with the army zeppelins to see who could tally the most destruction . In London , the mood was ugly and defiant . A primitive defense system had been devised , but the zeppelins were steadily improving their bombing and defensive capabilities and hence their value as a terror weapon . No longer was it a matter of feinting experimental raids by one and two ships . There were nights now when the coastal lookouts spotted flotillas of four or five of the giant airships moving like long , dark cloudsp294across the Channel . As ominous and slow and out of range as the weather , the zeppelins would begin a slow descent at King 's Lynn , every hamlet in their path blacking out as the droning airships swept like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pursuing Colette , but thanks to Lawrence he was being more subtle than usual  --  tepid , in f#ct . Yes , Lawrence had rather spoiled his stride with these accusations about being a sexual predatorand sensation seeker . Russell was being so mild and tentative that Colette had grown wary herself , sensing that the moralist was having second thoughts , no doubt because she was married . No telling how long this impasse would have lasted were it not for the bleat of a police whistle , blown by an old warden wobbling down the street on a bicycle that bore the sign KINDLY TAKE COVER . As the streetlightsdimmed and went dead , Colette said : You should come with me . I 'm only a few blocks away . He was only too happy to agree . Emboldened then , he took the liberty of pressing his hand against the small of her perspiring back as he squired her through darkness suddenly filled with voices , blowing whistles , barkingdogs and slamming doors and windows . Yet while others rushed by to get to shelter , Colette @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stopping to play with a maundering cat , then gazing at the stars , remarking , Oh , you can really see them now , ca n't you ? Quite as if you were out at sea . Watching her , Russell wondered if his anxiety was in anticipation of impending sex or falling bombs . Here , he said , smoothing her shoulder . We ought to be going , do n't you think ? Oh , she said . She sounded surprised . Of course . I 'm just one block over . Passing through a narrow , vine-choked archway , they entered the courtyard of her building , where people were now veering toward the shelter . Should n't we go into the shelter ? he asked , feeling for her arm . There 's time , she said , feeling back . I 'm only on the third floor . Her palm was damp as she took his hand and led him up the narrow stairs , clogged with sweaty bodies hugging bundles , blurting infants , pets . Cyril . . . Cyril , is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shoulder , then quickly retract when he said it was n't . Once at Colette 's door , he burned six matches while she jiggled the lock . I 've only three more , he said impatiently . Ca n't I try ?  |p295But  Colette did n't seem to hear , just kept rattling the lock , all the while chattering about her last role as daughter Winnifred in the drawing room farce Father 's Fond Fairest . It just closed at the Whitehall , she said . Ever hear of it ? Well , I 'm not surprised  --  it was dreadful rubbish , but popular . As usual , I played an ingenue  --  I 'm always playing precious , conniving little ingenues , gigglingto the audience and saying , But Pa-pa ! Oh , Plleee-ease , Pa-pa . You do n't know what a frightful bore it is , wearing patent shoes and some enormous bow in your hair . I 'm dying to age a little . Well , said Russell glumly , striking another match . I hope you wo n't feel you must wear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be silly , she protested , stroking his arm . You 're not at all old . My own father is sixty-something . The latch broke , and they alighted into stuffy darkness . Can you see ? she asked . I hate blacking out the windows , so we ca n't very well switch on a light . Here . Just a sec  --  Before he could object , she handed him a glass of sherry , then gulped hers down , all the while watching him with a faint smile . Bringing his glass to his lips , he found the edge sticky from some previous drinker  --  perhaps Harold , he thought , as he swallowed it , distastefully warm and sweet . Again he said , I think we ought to go . But Colette kissed him lightly , then slipped a cool hand up the back of his coat as he pulled her toward him . Two sallies before he said again , Colette , I 'd love nothing better than to stay but we really must go now . But she only pressed back , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always pack you in absolutely hours before anything happens . And I hate it , being shut up with so many people , really I do . And the chances are one in two million  --  they said so in the papers . Besides , they never come over this end . She gave him no time to object but instead went into the bathroom . Looking around , hearing the familiar running of water , his stomach flutterynow , he wondered if the shoes of absent Husband Harold , the understudy , were in the closet , then dourly figured that this made him the understudy 's understudy  --  Daddy Dearest . And then Colette reappeared , her white skin faintly stippled in the wafer-thin light . She snipped open his shirt buttons with her fingers , then gently laid him down , saying , You know , you really are a dear , lovely man . . . Her sheets were agreeably cool but did not smell quite clean , and he wondered again if it was Harold or some other young admirer he smelled as her mouth opened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she **25;15011;TOOLONG that he would n't do or say anything for which he would come home blaming himself . She was also tired from lack of sleep . And too heavy to find pleasure in all that walking , just to look at things she did n't want or need . It was hard enough just lugging her big body from town to town , following the men . And why examine baskets and jugs and knickknacks they could not carry with them , or use during their brief stay in other people 's homes ? Even the lacy shawls , the embroidered vests and girdles and dresses , the jewelry and perfumes , failed to entice her as they did the other women . They seldom had ; even as a girl she had sense enough to realize such adornments only called attention to her size  --  her overgrown body and plain , big-boned face . Once her father had actually brought her a little scarf . . . . red and gold stripes , like a pretty little snake  --  fascinating ; she had dared to touch it , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Laughter ! How ludicrous she must have looked . His only present , though she found a half shekel once under her pallet . Who else could have hidden it there ? She feared to spend it , and feared to show it to her mother . . . . Always so little money , even after she married Peter . She had learned to be thrifty , even when Peter 's hauls were good ; she had put it away , saving for just such a day as this , and a good thing too . Every penny must count . It troubled Adah that . Magdalene , in her gratefulness , her fervent loyalty and love , wanted to buy things for her and Peter . Magdalene 's money could be better spent . Was better spent , for most of it went into the common purse for food and lodging for all of them . But there was an air of richness and plenitude about Magdalene , a generosity that spilled over on gifts for others . Oddly , it did not bother Adah how the money had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of humor . With a kind of indignant , wry amusement , she remembered the near stoning by those self-righteous men . Had they dreamed , those who squandered money on such favors , that one day it might be used for such a noble purpose ? " Find something , " Magdalene had urged today . " Just something to remember our visit to Caesarea Philippi , for we start home tomorrow . To please her , Adah had fingered a few trinkets  --  beads , spices , dishes  --  and chosen a little bracelet made of shells . It jingled on herp151plump wrist now as she lighted the lamp . The shells were a luminous pink inside , and they glistened in its light . Beyond the wall she could hear the other family shouting and arguing as they got ready for the evening meal . Such rowdy children ; she would be glad to leave . She tried to take comfort in the bracelet , to rejoice in it , a symbol of celebrationand escape . But she was still anxious about Peter . And she knew , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some shatteringexperience . His big ruddy face was pale and shaken ; he looked dazed , groping about for a place to put his wet cloak . Wordlessly , she took it from him and then knelt with the basin she had waiting , to wash his feet . They were swollen and blue ; she massaged them vigorously and dried them for him . When would he speak ? Not until after prayers and supper . Later . How much later ? He was bursting with it , that was plain . It was hard for him to keep a secret ; he suffered . He had to confide in someone . He loved her . He would have to confide in her . Peter only pretended to eat . At last , giving his wife an embarrassed , apologetic look , he pushed his plate away . Adah took it withoutcomment , pausing only to kiss the place where the hair was beginning to thin on his bushy head . Humming as usual , she began to scrape the food into a small bowl . It must not be wasted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They seemed to be quite poor . She could feel Peter staring at her , in torment , biting his thick cracked lips . Her humming stopped . She came to his rescue . " What is it ? " she asked , over her shoulder . " You may as well tell me . " Adah waited . Patiently . The sounds beyond the wall were quieting ; she could hear only the baby crying now , and the bang of a pot . Her heart was beating hard . She wanted to bang a pot herself . " Nothing I can share , even with you , " he finally said . " Do not ask me more . " " Very well . " She went on with her task , began wiping the table . He got up , clumsily , moving out of her way . " I can not tell you , " he insisted . " No , no , I can not speak of it . It is . . . something you could not comprehend . Adah threw down the cloth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stupid that I could not comprehend whatever it is that is troubling my own husband ? "  | " Forgive me ! " Peter passed a trembling hand over his eyes . " I saw a thing today that I dare not speak of , " he cried . " No , no , do not tempt me . We were charged to tell no one , for it is beyond mortal comprehension  --  not just yours , but mine as well , though I saw it with my own eyes ! " He had been charging about the room ; now he sat down again , in misery , his hairy fists clenched , yet there was an expression of wonder on his face . " Oh , Adah , bear with me . . . . " He groped , almost piteously , for her hand . " It was so beautiful  --  terrible and beautiful at the same time . This . . . vision that we saw , James and John and I. One day I will describe it to you . But not until I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Peter choked . A tear darted suddenly down his cheek . Adah was gripping his shoulders from behind . Gently she reached over to wipe it away . " Until what , my beloved ? " " Until ... Jesus has risen , as he promised . For what we witnessed today confirms what I was trying to tell you before . Jesus is the Messiah  --  thisI know , even more surely than in the moment I confessed him . He is the Messiah , who must suffer and die for us . Oh , I have hoped and prayed so desperately that it need not happen , no matter what he said . And today my hopes were raised to heaven . But I was wrong  --  Jesus made that clear . He will have no tabernacle on earth , only a tomb . He will live again ! " Peter whispered passionately . His eyes were wet but shining . " But he has pledged us to silence until that time . As we came down from the mountain , he made this command : We must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until the Son of Man is raised from the dead . "  |p153YESUS  ... my son . Tinoki , tinoki  --  my little one ! " Mary heard herselfcrooning crooning an endearment she had n't used in years . " Wake up . You are home  --  it is all right ! " He sat up , in a cold sweat , a boy again smelling breakfast , afraid he had overslept  --  he would be late for school ! But no , he had been fleeing through a great city , a tangle of dark streets . . . . His pursuers were waving crutches , armed with stones , some brandishing whips , others marching ponderously along consulting their scrolls . . . . The ill and the dying were reaching out to clutch him before he escaped , some of them shouting hosannas , others sneering . . . . There he is ! Take him ! . . . He was about to be caught , dragged before the Sanhedrin ... . " Hush now , my darling . " He felt his mother 's hand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . Go back to sleep now ; you are so tired . " She began to pull the covers about his shoulders , but he restrained her . " No , it 's time I got up and gave a better answer to my brothers . How long have I slept ? " " Around the clock , I 'm afraid . They left for the festival yesterday . " Mary hesitated . " At least Josey and Simon and their families . I 'm not sure about Jude . James is n't going  --  his wife is ill again . " Jesus nodded wretchedly , and plunged his face into his hands . Two of his brothers . had arrived in Capernaum a few days before on , i pretext of business , but actually to persuade him to come home once more . Simon and Josey were waiting for him one night on his stoop . They were here , they admitted , at their mother 's imploring . She wasp154very uneasy about him  --  his health , his rest ; she often had nightmares that he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faintly . " Would I be any safer in Nazareth ? " " You will be as long as we 're there ! " Josey blustered . He flexed his burly arm , and so did Simon . Suddenly they were all laughing and embracing each other , fighting playfully , as they had as boys . This was true , Jesus thought in a rush of grateful affection . They had not hesitated in that time of near disaster . Despite all that had happened  --  the embarrassment and failure of his visit , the outright public rejection  --  his family still missed him , wanted the best for him , stood ready to defend him . " And why waste any more time here ? " Simon glanced around the barren room , finding it hard to hide his distaste . His once cowlicky red hair was now subdued , his beard trimmed and curled in the Persianfashion . He had married a slightly older woman , a widow of refinement and means . At her persuasion he was limiting his carpentry to making cabinets for the better homes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so poorly . " You 've been around Galileelong enough , " he advised flatly . " You 'll never get anywhere out in the provinces . These people already know what you can do , " he condescended . " Besides , they 're not important . " No , wait  --  Jesus had quite a number of important followers here too , Josey had hastily tried to correct . Lawyers , judges , doctors .. . " You were n't with us , so you did n't see them . But Simon 's right , " he assured Jesus . " The really important people are in Judea . You have disciples there too . Why hide yourself out here ? Go to Jerusalem if you want to become well known . " " Come with us , " Simon said  --  it was both an invitation and a challenge . " We 're going to the feast soon . If you can really do these things , show them to the world . " Jesus had turned from the cupboard , where he was crumbling food for Ben @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I went to a feast in Jerusalem ? The Feast of Weeks . Or maybe you did n't hear . I nearly got myself killed . " They regarded him uncomfortably . " Of course we heard , " said Josey . " Everything you do comes back to us . " Simon 's mouth tightened . " And reflects on us . " " And if you did perform this miracle on the Sabbath ? " Josey pro/tested , sounding doubtful . " You know that 's considered against the Law . " " God does not close the pool at Bethesda on the Sabbath , " Jesus said quietly . " Or prevent the sun from shining , or babies from being born . The man was suffering ; he had been ill for years . He 'd been lying by the pool for days . He was on the point of death . " " But did you have to encourage him to take up his bed and carry it though the streets ? " Simon reminded , sounding judicial . " That , too , is an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have had him do with it ? Leave it behind ? He needed it . " " Well , it was foolish . No wonder the authorities were after you . Sometimes it seems you 're deliberately out to provoke them . " It was useless . They did n't understand . And whatever their motives  --  tobait or to encourage  --  they did n't actually believe . More vehementlythan he meant to , Jesus put down the bowl for his dog . " I will call attention to these tyrannies whenever I can . People must be freed from this stupid enslavement to the Sabbath simply because the priests say so . It is not sinning to take care of normal human needs . No , no , that 's a terrible corruption of God 's commandment . The Sabbath was made for man , not man for the Sabbath ! " The other two shook their heads , despairing . They had not meant their mission to go like this . But now that they were into it , there seemed no turning back . Jesus had done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what really upset the Sanhedrin . " The man actually believedyou 'd forgiven his sins  --  or so he told the Jews , " Josey plunged on , incredulous . His color was high . " It 's said you stood on the Temple steps claiming you had this power and authority , straight from the Father . That the Father loves you and wants you to be honored with him  --  that he has shared all knowledge with you because you are  --  you refer to yourself as  --  " Josey choked , unable to say the words . Coolly , almost objectively , Simon took over . " As God 's own son . That you promised eternal life to all those who believe in you . This is preposterous . Personally , I refuse to accept such rumors . You are not mad , and I refuse to think you 're a heretic . Making yourself equal to God ! You would never say such a thing . Forgive us  --  we 're your brothersand we love you , " he insisted . " But you must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Jesus said abruptly . " Go to the feastp156yourselves . " He was very tired and deeply discouraged . It had not been a good time for them to appear . " Frankly , I ca n't see why you would even suggest that I go back again to ' prove what I can do , ' as you say . I would only embarrass you and stir up more trouble before my time has come . You have all the time in the world  --  I do n't . " " Then you 're not coming ? " " To the Feast of Tabernacles  --  no , I do n't think so . But since our mother is worried  --  yes , for her sake , of course I 'll come home for a little while . " Now , with Mary sitting there beside his bed , Jesus was infinitely glad to be home . He had roused up in his concern . He lay back again , eyes closed for a moment , one arm flung over his curly head . When he opened them , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mary said . " It may help to confide in me . Things are not going well ? " Jesus nodded , ran a hand distractedly through his hair . " I 'm tired and disappointed , Mother  --  you did right to send for me . I 'm getting frustrated  --  yes , and angry with the people who refuse to understand . My work is faltering , even in Galilee , where it began . " " But the multitudes that follow you ! We heard  --  we thought .. . we saw them ourselves that night in Capernaum . Though we have worried  --  " " That scene at the house of Zebedee was deceptive . Do n't judgeme by the numbers that have flocked to hear me , but by those whoactually want the kind of kingdom I have come to establish . Peopleare not repenting ; they 're not willing to change their lives and makethe sacrifices I demand . All they want is food and miracles for themselves . It 's what I was afraid of when the power first came upon me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helping people in need : how I looked forward to it , though I sensed the dangereven then  --  that that 's all they would really want of me in the end . " Mary had never seen her son like this ; sad and yet with a newfierceness . " They wo n't believe the kingdom of heaven is within them , it can be enjoyed right now , here on earth , by following what I teachabout doing the will of God . No , no , they want a messiah who willsolve all their problems for them , heal them , feed them . An earthlyking who will overthrow Rome and make them all healthy , happy andrich ! And when this does n't happen , they fall away , many of them.  |p157Many  of my first , most enthusiastic followers are gone . Disillusioned , or scared away by all the false stories and threats . The Sanhedrin has sent agents all over the country warning people to stay away from me . That I 'm an impostor , saying and doing things that could get them in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ darling , you of all people ! " " True , for everyone who 's afraid to come or drops away there are always others , but mainly looking for miracles , what they can get . And even where we have done great good , my apostles and I , we have been rejected . Lately my men have come back from some of their journeys appalled at the treatment they received . Chorazin , Bethsaida , Tyre and Sidon . Even Capernaum ! I fear for those cities , " he said grimly . " I have upbraided them , even cursed them aloud for their unbelief . " Jesus got up suddenly and began to dress . Mary followed him to the chest , where he was impatiently searching . " Let me help . Is this what you are looking for ? " She handed him his tunic , gazed at him a moment , eyes large and questioning . " I can not believe what I am hearing . Not from you . " " I am not perfect , Mother . " " But you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Only the Father is perfect . Yes , the Father and I are one . But I have been sent to earth to live as a man , feel as a man . I am a human being too , " he pleaded , on a note of despair . " You know that . I eat , I sleep , I get tired , I get indignant  --  righteously indignant , I hope  --  when things go wrong . I lose patience with my apostles because they sometimes seem so blind or heedless , either not listening to what I say or unable or unwilling to understand . " Mary continued to gaze at him , bewildered and protesting . Why ? she wondered  --  even as on that tragic day when she had sent for Jesus , sure that he would save his desperately injured father . But he had only knelt by that beautiful broken body and wept . " You have been given special powers , " she whispered , her face intense . " Can you not change all that ? " " No , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to earth with magical powers to change the hearts of people . I can not turn them into instant perfect beings . He gave me only the power to heal their bodies , if they believe in me , and to speak the truth to them . " Hep158paused , gazing out the window . " God could , if he had willed it , have had his perfect kingdom on earth long ago . The multitudes marching ' in step , saying , ' Yes , Father , no , Father , ' at his command . But that 's not how he wants his children to change ! They must first love him  --  enough to believe in the one he has sent . It must be their free will to love and obey the Father , and their own choice to change . If they refuse , they will perish in their own sins . They will never eat the bread of eternal life that I have been sent to offer them . " Jesus was calmer now . He sat down on the couch to put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he continued , " must be with their own knowledge and consent . It is why , as you know , I have not healed your own brother , Uncle Esau . He does not wish it ! We discussed it , I offered ; but after some thought , he is unwilling . He has walked in the darkness too long ; he would have to learn his way all over again in a world of sight . He is afraid . . . . And the wife of James  --  though we have never discussed it , I know that she scoffs at the very thought ; she does not believe . But she also saw her mother die in childbirth , and she is terrified at the prospect . It is why she miscarries so often  --  she is secretly afraid . " Jesus stood up ; he felt better , as if a number of things were resolved . " And when people are healed , physically or mentally , they must do their part . They can not return to their old ways of sinning or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least in part , though there are many exceptions . People must assume responsibility for their own lives . I will help them , the Father will help them , if they sincerely pray and do their best . But neither the Father nor I can walk for them or eat or sleep or love or refrain from sinning for them . This they must do for themselves . " Jesus held out his arms , and his mother went into them . They stood hugging each other there , with the bright morning sun streamingin . Outside , birds were singing ; donkeys brayed and clattered on the cobbles ; they could hear people hurrying by on their way to join a caravan , many of them carrying jugs of wine or oil . The Feast of Tabernacles was a popular one . The Feast , most country people called it , to celebrate the last grape and olive harvest . Most would spend the week in one of the charming forests of booths and tents which sprang up all over Jerusalem and surrounding neighborhoods at this seasonp159reminders of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reached the Promised Land . " Oh , Mother , I remember happier days , when our whole family would go to the Feast . And all the places where we camped . I can still smell those olive boughs . " " And the grapes , " Mary said wistfully . " How your little brothers would throw them at each other ! " She laughed . " And the time Elizabethand John came down from their big house to join us . But it was so crowded I seem to remember they left before morning . " " No , that was John and I , after you thought we were asleep . We slipped out , hoping to find another procession  --  " He could feel his mother trembling , suddenly fighting tears . ' " John . . . " she moaned softly . " Oh , Elizabeth , Elizabeth ! " Jesus held her tighter . " I will go to see her ; I 'll do what I can forher . " Mary drew back , blinking . " But you 're not going ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Simon and Josey are right about some things . I can accomplish little more in Galilee . I 'm living like a fugitive , always one step ahead of a posse of Pharisees . It 's time I faced them . " Mary wiped her eyes , leading the way to the kitchen . " Your brothersare confused about you , " she tried to explain . " They did n't mean to upset you ; they just want to be proud of you . If you can do these works , they reason , you should be doing them in Jerusalem , where it matters  --  but in accordance with the Law . They really hoped to persuadeyou of this , and also to restrain you , if possible , from saying ... well , dangerous things . It actually seemed to them that such an appearance might stop some of the stories that have worried them . " " They do n't know what they 're asking . They do n't really believe . " " No , perhaps not . It 's . . . hard for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but please understand they are sincere . They honestly hoped your behavior this time might result in more success , and help to quiet your critics . " Jesus sighed deeply and shook his head . " They are right about one thing . I must be willing to act where I will be seen . If the world is to see this light , it must be shown in high places . . . . Not that that wo n't cause trouble , " he added . " But you will be careful ? " she pleaded.  | " I 'll try not to embarrass my brothers . I 'll go in private this time . If possible , I 'll keep still . But if I am moved in the Spirit to speak later , I can not promise not to . I can do no less than my cousin . John would n't compromise , no matter how many people he offended . " Mary 's eyes flashed , bright with pain . " And what a price he paid ! " " Yes . " Jesus went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and held her close again . " The price of truth comes high , Mother  --  we both know that . I 'm not afraid for myself ; my only concernis you . Oh , if only I could spare you ! " One afternoon , near the end of the feast , Lazarus heard Jesus for the first time . " Wait , listen , " said his older friend Nicodemus , as they were about to make their way through the usual crowd gathered around the Temple steps . " This is someone I want you to hear . " Lazarus hesitated . His black eyes , always alert , interested , were faintly bemused . " A Galilean ? " He had caught only a few words , enough to notice the accent . " He speaks like a Galilean . " " He is , " said Nicodemus calmly . " But a strange one . Different . Listen to what he is saying . " " But he 's attacking the Pharisees , " Lazarus exclaimed after a moment . " That 's you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standing so calmly by , robed arms folded , a little smile playing on his long lips . " Calling you hypocrites , nothing but whited sepulchers ! " " Well , are n't we ? " The older man 's eyes twinkled  --  keen , kindly , wise . " As a Sadducee , I 'd think you 'd agree . " " Agreed ! " said Lazarus , slapping his shoulder . They both laughed . " There 's hypocrisy and corruption on both sides of the Sanhedrin . But listen " Nicodemus cocked his silver head . " Look at his face and listen : He has lots more to say . " " Do not tremble before the judgment of those in high places , " Jesus was telling the people . " Seek only the approval of the Father , who loves you and wants the best for you . Do not venerate the scribes and Pharisees  --  no , nor the Sadducees ; they are all of one breed , struttingabout the synagogues and streets in their fine clothes , their phylacteriesprominent on their foreheads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be heard , and hide their sins in the darkness , where they will not be seen . They demand the highest seats at the banquet tables , where like the priests they devour the meat of the poor . Do not honor these men , I say , honor only the Father , and the Son who has been sent to you to warn you of the judgment to come . " Lazarus ' black brows had shot up , but he was listening intently , chin propped on his hand . To mingled shouts of " Hosanna ! " and some baiting and heckling , the voice of Jesus continued to ring out : " They impose on you taxes and burdens they refuse to bear themselves . And what do they do in return ? Nothing , save hound and seek to punish anyone who seems to break a single rule about the Sabbath , or what is clean or unclean . You men in the marketplace , I tell you solemnly no food that a farmer brings you to sell is clean or unclean , no matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' meals  --  do n't be afraid of what you can serve or how it is cooked . My Father in heaven has created all food for the nourishment of the body . Nothing that goes in by way of the mouth can corrupt it , but what comes out of the mouth . For what comes out of the mouth proceeds from the heart  --  evil thoughts , murder , adultery , fornication , theft , false witness , slander . These are what defile a man . " Listen to me , hear me , believe what I say , for these are not my words but those of my Father who sent me . " Lazarus gave a little start . Frowning , he looked at Nicodemus . His friend , whom he loved and admired , was taking this in as if transfixed . " Does he speak here often ? " Lazarus asked in low tones . " No , he 's usually out in the provinces . But he 's generally here every day at festival time . " " But where does he get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I ca n't quite place the school where he must have studied . Hillel .. . Gamaliel . . . Eleazar . . . ? " " I do n't know , " said Nicodemus . " One of the academies in Galilee , maybe , but I doubt it  --  his parents were poor ; they had six children . But he 's obviously a scholar ; nobody questions his learning . It does n't matter , " he said with conviction . " Jesus has a higher source . " " Even so , by whose authority is he here ? " " He refuses to say . The priests and elders are always sending somebody to question him , to try to arrest him for supposed lack ofp162credentials , but he 's too smart for them . Last time they almost got him , until I interfered . I 'm surprised you have n't heard . " " I 'm a busy man . I do n't come here often myself . " Nicodemus laughed softly . " You do n't know what you 're missing ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on . " The people wo n't have it , most of them . Especially the poor . Look at them  --  " The two poised , well-dressed men turned to survey the crowd : Jews from all over the known world swarmed through the magnificent Temple gates at festival time . Jews from Babylon , Persia , Greece , Abyssinia , the west , the desert . Rich and poor , in elegance and rags , a riot of multicolored costumes . Wrapped in sheets or sheepskins , even lion skins , they came , or wearing fine linens and woolens and silks , brilliantlydyed . But here on the north portico steps it was sackcloth and the worn , faded garments of the poor that prevailed . Here they gathered  --  grizzledearth people from the country , the wretched who dwelled in the walls and hovels of the lower city , the destitute from all over the land . Their gaunt , life-scarred faces were lifted , some of them mouths open , like starving birds frantic to gulp and savor every crumb of hope and promise from his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying : " Come unto me , all you who labor and are heavy-laden ? . . . Ask and you will receive , knock and the door will be opened . . . . Eat of this bread that I offer you , drink of this water  --  believe in me and you will never be hungry or thirsty again ! " " Yes , yes , hosanna ! " their glad shouts interrupted . Or they noddedand nudged each other , murmuring , " The prophet has come at last . This is the Christ , this is the One , and the authorities must know it . " Though some were more reticent , some impatient for miracles , while a few detractors cupped their mouths to call out the ancient taunt , " Nazarene , Nazarene ! Can anything good come out of Naza-reth ? " " Leave him alone , " demanded not only the poor but others who wanted to hear him . " Ca n't you see he 's a wonderful man ? He may even be the Messiah . " " He ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Jesus motioned toward them , smiling faintly , unperturbed . " Of course you know where I come from , " he sang out proudly . " You know where I was born and raised . But sad to say , you do n't knowp163the One who sent me to you with these truths . I do know him , for I come directly from him . For the sake of your own souls , believe in me as the scripture has said , and live ! " Lazarus was frowning . He had an insatiable curiosity and he never made snap judgments ; he gave every speaker , whatever his station , complete , patient attention . His own response would be crisp , fast , incisive , but even in disagreement , pleasant . " The man is making some powerful claims . But I 'm afraid they 're right  --  he ca n't be the Messiah . Everybody knows the true Messiah is to come out of Beth-lehem . " " He does , " said Nicodemus . " Jesus was born there . " " How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It 's too noisy ; we ca n't talk here . Come  --  there 's a bench over there , beside the wall . " Lazarus glanced uneasily over his shoulder . " Will he be all right ? " His own sense of decorum made him embarrassed for the man . Such brilliance and fervor and beauty , even in outrage . Those haunting eyes . That such a man should expose himself before the crass mob ! Let alone the Temple police , who stood about , arms folded , uneasy , knowing their duty was to find some cause to seize him . " Do n't worry , they wo n't touch him , " said Nicodemus . " His miracles , you know . I think some of them are a little bit afraid of him . " They walked across the grass and sat down on the marble bench . The sun was almost blinding on the Temple 's lavish gates and golden roof , setting everything afire . The bench was cool and it was quieter here , though people continued to stream by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as the feast was almost over . " You sound as if you believe this man , " Lazarus challenged , his alert interested eyes fixed on his friend . " Why ? " For a moment Nicodemus stared down at the grass between his knees . Then he lifted his long thoughtful face . " I have been following his career for years . Ever since he was twelve years old . The first time I ever heard him was in the Temple . He was waiting for his parents  --  they had become separated . He was questioning the men gathered there , and giving them answers as well . " At twelve ? " " Yes . It was so remarkable I stopped to listen . Joseph of Arimatheawas there too  --  you may know him , a scribe , a very learned man.  |p164He  was questioning the boy intensely that day , and we both were astonished at his answers . We both saw great promise in him . We had no idea , of course , of this ! " Nicodemus gestured in the direction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At that time I asked him myself about his birthplace , which he said was Bethlehem  --  which seemed impossible , of course , in view of the slaughter there that year . Later I tracked this down , and found his facts were right . Later , much later , I sought Jesus out , just to be sure . It was right after he started his ministry  --  about three years ago . " Nicodemus turned away suddenly , visibly shaken , his lean throat working . " I went to him in secret one night . Even then he was preachingmuch as he does today , warning of disaster even to the Temple unless we changed our ways , especially there . As a member of the Sanhedrin , I did n't dare to be seen with him in public , I 'm almost ashamed to say . Now I have more courage ; they all know where I stand . Joseph of Arimathea , too , is now bold enough to defend him . But then , with all that first trouble between Herod and John the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or was . Poor John , a radical to the end . A lot of people were being careful about Jesus too  --  at least I thought I had to be . " Anyway , that night . . . Where was I ? Oh , yes , Jesus told me things I 'd never heard before . That a man must be born again , both by water and the Spirit , else he can not enter the kingdom of God . I can hear him yet . His words were so beautiful they burned themselves into my heart : ' The wind blows where it wills , and you hear the sound of it , but you do not know whence it comes or whither it goes ; so it is with everyone who is born of the Spirit . ' When I asked him how this could be , he was surprised at my ignorance , that as a teacher of Israel I did not know this already and understand it . We talked most of the night , I remember . It was the most important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great secret he is only now declaring to the world . Jesus is the promised One . He is God 's only son , sent into the world not to condemn it but to save it . He is the light of the world , and he offers eternal life to all who believe in him . " Nicodemus paused , deeply moved . " I have followed him ever since . He has becomelike a son to me . " Lazarus sprang up suddenly . " Take me to him , " he said briskly . " I , too , would know this man , "  | " Of course . But then I must be on my way . It 's getting late . " Lazarus ' heart was pounding as they went back across the grass . The baiting and cries of praise had stopped . The crowd was dispersing , although a few people still surrounded Jesus , trying to draw him into argument , or hoping for miracles . Three young men who seemed to be his aides had appeared and were attempting to dissuade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tired , anxious to be off but keeping a watchful eye for any disturbance . Jesus looked over their heads , his face brightening at sight of Nicodemus . " This is my friend Lazarus , of Bethany , " Nicodemus said , when they had embraced . " We often do business together . " The eyes of Jesus and Lazarus met . There was instant recognition between them , as there had been between Jesus and Simon Peter . A sudden overwhelming sense of their mutual destiny . " Come home with me , " Lazarus heard himself blurting . His voice , usually so crisp and clear , was thick with excitement . " Come for supper . I have two sisters who will be happy to meet you . Come stay with us ! " Jesus hesitated . " How I 'd love to , " he said , " but I have some men with me . " He indicated Peter , Andrew and Judas , who had sought him out at the festival . " I can not leave my friends . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Bid them come with us , all of them . " He moved toward them on his long quick step , robes billowing , holding out his hands . It had been years since he had felt so happy about anything.  |p166LAZARUS  and his sisters lived in a handsome house set high on a hill in Bethany , a village of mostly small flat-topped dwellings scatteredaround the shoulder of the Mount of Olives . Though only two miles from Jerusalem , it was quiet here and restful . In many ways it reminded Jesus and his men of the villages and countryside of Galilee , for the groves of Lazarus stretched to the horizon ; and within the walls of that gracious house they were to find a second home . Although surprised to see them that first night , the sisters were overjoyed . Lazarus kept too much to himself , they thought . It was exciting to have him troop in with these vigorous strangers . Martha , the elder , was especially thrilled . Cooking was her passion ; she always prepared far more than the three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way , she planned it so : extra portions for the birds , dogs and other creatures that came to her door , and even more left to take to the poor . Her brother indulged her in this ; he was a generous man , with large holdings . And he sensed , sometimes with a twinge of guilt , that such appeased her secret maternal need . The three clung to each other . They had been orphaned while Lazarus was still at his studies in Jerusalem , and his sisters were much younger . He had given up everything to care for them , and for the family properties . Lazarus was of medium height , attractively sharpfeatured , with fine bones . He walked with a rather long step for a man his size , as if in a hurry to get where he was going . Though he was now only forty years old , his thick hair was snow white . Its black had begun to frost at the death of his young wife in childbirth , and whitenedcompletely , almost overnight , when their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Martha had put aside their own dreams to rush to the baby 's mothering  --  it was itself a weak little thing . Lazarus had marriedlate , feeling uncomfortable about it , for he had not yet succeeded in finding anyone quite good enough for his sisters . He felt responsible for them ; he could not give them up to anyone who could not provide well for them  --  and he had come to depend on them . Every suitor who showed interest he discouraged , until the whole parade of young men around Bethany had disappeared . Mary and Martha , at first busy caring for the pleasant but sickly young wife , then for the child , had not resented this too much . Mary , the younger , prettier and more lively , did sometimes weep as she cradled her pillow , fantasizing a husband 's arms around her , his babe in her belly . Martha was more shy and dignified . Though she sometimescomplained to Mary , she was in some ways relieved . They felt safe with Lazarus . He had become both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The shock of that terrible loss only drew the three closer together . They had worshiped the bright little thing . The house , however luxuriant , was empty and silent without her . They were bereft , at first bewildered , realizing that again they had only each other . Now more than ever the sisters began to live for their brother , who had plunged feverishly back into business to assuage his grief . Dispensing with servants , they hurled their energies into keeping the house , like themselves , exquisite , charming , meticulously clean . Everything glistened and shone  --  the cedar walls , the marble floors , the beautiful silver and glass . Sometimes Martha 's hands ached and swelled from the eternal scrubbing and polishing . Then she would slip into Mary 's room and choose a fragrant unguent to rub into them , from the array of bottles on Mary 's dressing table . Mary helped cook and clean too , but mostly at Martha 's direction . Mary had a more ardent , creative nature . She loved to dance and sing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chestnut hair , enjoying the way it flashed and crackled . She delighted in walking barefooton the velvety Persian rugs , with their jewel-bright colors . She had found and bargained for most of them in the bazaars . She had even designed and had a craftsman make some of the furniture , and the lovely alabaster lamps . But she was happiest planting and tending the flowers that were such a glory in the garden ; and bringing arm/loads into the house , which she would spend hours arranging  --  often to Martha 's irritation . At times they argued , as women will , though they had outgrown the subtle rivalry that had troubled them as girls . Martha was a tall , quiet , sweet-faced woman , quite striking with her milk-white skin and her now silvering black hair , always so preciselyparted in the middle . Her big dark gentle eyes were rather wistful . She had a way of keeping her head low , then lifting it suddenly to gaze with a searching intensity into the speaker 's face , as if seeking something she never found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , restrained . She had few friends and little social life , for she was aware of her status as an unmarried woman . But she was very graceful and composed . Even in the marketplace , where other women battered their way , or stood laughing and talking , she dealt quickly and coolly with the seller , then glided on , people making way before her dignity and seeming assurance . Unlike Mary , who enjoyed such forays , she could hardly wait to get home to the place she loved best , her kitchen . Lazarus had humoredher by building on an extra room where she could have her own indoor oven with its shelves for bread and its ever-turning spit . It was her haven . She worked and rested there as with a lover , giving to it her finest creative energies . No one could prepare a joint of kid more delicious , or sweetmeats as delicate . Even her vegetables were tempting , with wines and sauces of her own invention ; her bread , more crisp than that of most women , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a comfort to the cold despair that sometimesracked Martha in secret . She would pull back her skirts and warm her long slim legs before it , admiring them with the dark silken growths of hair . Now into this quiet and private place new inspiration had burst . Life once more began to pour through the spacious house . The women , and in some ways Lazarus too , began to live for the festivals , when Jesus was sure to join them . Though there were days between  --  and this filled them with constant hope and expectation  --  when he might come anyway : sometimes alone , more often bringing several of his apostles . Shy burly fishermen , most of them , but all of them fascinating , for they brought an aura of adventure and travel with them . How many places they had been ! Capernaum , Tyre and Sidon , thep169great northern mountains , Caesarea Philippi , the Sea of Galilee . And with him ! Though Martha lived in the very shadow of a great city , her own world was small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hebron and Jericho , and a few times , the nearby Dead Sea  --  such a desolate place , smelling of salt and sulfur : like her own existence , desolate and barren in the seemingly endless periods between Jesus ' visits . Then  --  ah , then  --  birds sang and the house teemed with life . Martha visualized the multitudes that followed Jesus , praising him , shouting hosannas . She tried to imagine the miracles , and failed . They were simply beyond her comprehension : feeding thousands , raising the dead . Such reports made her uncomfortable , for they removedhim too far from the glorious miracles they had witnessed here . It was enough that Jesus had cast out the demon of grief from her brother , and poured a heady new wine of life and emotion through all of them . The Messiah ? The phrase eluded her ; like his miracles , it was not really important . Martha knew only that she lived fully and sweetly in his presence . That Jesus had enemies , critics who spoke out against him in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destroy him  --  appalled her , filled her with such personal pain and fright she refused to countenance it . No , no , it could not be  --  not that wonderful man who could bring such joy ! Sometimes all twelve of Jesus ' band would be gathered around her long table ( fourteen , counting Lazarus and Jesus ) . Rugged , enthusiasticmen  --  how they ate ! How they laughed and argued sometimes , how their rich male voices rang out in the songs and prayers . The sisters , serving , scarcely could believe their good fortune : to see Lazarusso filled with life and happiness again . Eating heartily once more , involved in fervent discussion of spiritual things . The voices sometimescontinued far into the night , after the sisters had cleared up and Martha spread out the dish towels to dry . Martha would lie awake , smiling to remember the men 's compliments , fulfilled at having pleased them . But growing uneasy , realizing that Mary had not said good night but was probably still with them , sitting on a cushion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drinking in every word . Even participating ! It was a letdown after such a beautifulevening ; Martha felt disappointed and somehow betrayed . Shep170would toss and turn , or lie alert , listening for Mary 's voice mingling with the others , or later her footsteps stealing softly to bed . Martha would stare at the ceiling , one hand over her mouth to stifle her own bewildering storm of emotions : loving and resenting her sister ; torn between admiration , envy , even a kind of pride in Mary , and all the while hurting and disapproving . Martha had tried to reason with her , in vain . " It just is n't  --  seemly , " she groped . " An unmarried girl alone with men . " " Martha , Martha , these are our guests ! " Mary gazed at her , astonished . " And they are men of God . Besides , our brother is there . " Laughing , she flung her arms around Martha and gave her a fond little shake . " Can you imagine Lazarus approving anything that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " No . " Reluctantly Martha laughed too , still troubled but ashamed of her misgivings . " Forgive me . " " You are missing so much , " Mary urged . " Why do n't you join us ? " " I 'm too tired , " Martha protested . " I could n't ! Oh , no , I just  --  could n't . " She wished she had n't said anything . She hated being the scolding sister . If only she could be free and open , like Mary . Not so bound up in herself . If only she could be more relaxed around men , not afraid to show the love that was sometimes bursting like some forbidden joy in her heart . Why did her hands tremble so in the presence of Jesus , her throat get so dry ? She would never forget that first night Lazarus had brought Jesus home . Their first sight of him  --  the sudden assault of his beauty and goodness when he smiled at them , his eyes , his whole being radiating love . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a guest . Obviously a prophet or a prince . Yet Mary had known at once what to do . While Martha was still fumbling around , trying to find enough vessels for the washing , Mary had rushed to her room and brought forth her most precious oil to anoint Jesus ' feet . She had unpinnedher own flowing hair and was drying them with it when Marthareturned . Martha had been stricken to see it , feeling remiss , but also a little shocked . Though this was a not uncommon tribute for some women to pay a very special guest , it seemed to Martha somehow  --  well  --  brazen . It had made her uncomfortable the few times shep171had witnessed it in other homes . Martha shrank before such a fervent display . She could not imagine herself doing such a thing . Nor , for that matter , Mary  --  until that night . Martha never mentioned it , nor did Mary , but both of them often thought of it , examining its significance in their hearts . Toward the end of fall , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Dedication . Together they polished all the lamps and filled them with fragrant oil . For this was also known as the Feast of Lights , to celebrate the victory of Judas Maccabaeus and his reconsecration of the Temple after it was defiled by Antiochus Epiphanes and his pagans . A time when golden candelabra blazed in the Temple and people danced in the brightly lighted streets . Every home must shine . Lazarus carried lamps outside to hang from the trees and bloom up and down the steps . This year , though it was fairly warm  --  a few roses still bloomed in Mary 's garden  --  an early snow was falling , adding to the sparkle . And Jesus was coming ! Again and again that final day , Mary dropped what she was doing to run hopefullyto the doorway and peer out . He had promised  --  stopping as he always did on his way to Jerusalem  --  hewould join them here as soon as the festivities were over . But as the day wore on , waiting became harder to bear , for both of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ falling faster , and the wind blowing harder . Even Lazarus looked worried when he came in , though he tried to keep his fears from his sisters . Had there been trouble again in Jerusalem ? He had n't been in the city all day , but surely , if anything had happened to Jesus , he 'd have heard of it . Despite the controversy Jesus provoked , it was hard to believe he could come to serious harm . Jesus was too clever to be entrapped ; his answers were always not only quick and wise but profound . As a Sadducee , Lazarus himself had debated with Jesus several times ; the man was impossible to refute . Pondering , Lazarus felt better . No , this was truly a man of God , and more . More even than a prophet . Perhaps even the Messiah that had been promised so long ! Surely Jesus was beyond the mere scheming treacheries of men . Surely he had God 's protection . " Now do n't fret , " Lazarus encouraged briskly . His black eyesp172sparkled with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be here soon . " " Jesus ! " " Nicodemus ! " In wonder , the two men stood for a second there on Solomon 's Porch , where each had taken shelter from the unexpected snow . Then with shouts of joy , they embraced , drew back a little and stood gazing at each other , hands still on each other 's shoulders . " I was looking for you , " the older man exclaimed . " But the last place I expected to find you was here in the Temple . Not after what happened this afternoon . " His lean distinguished face was both relievedand dismayed . " Word reached me at my bank ; I left as soon as I could . Oh , Jesus , my son , thank heaven you are all right ! Is it true they were about to stone you ? " " A few . They did n't succeed . Some of the crowd were unruly , not many . " Jesus looked serious but unperturbed . " It was not hard to dissuade them  --  the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " But I do worry , " cried Nicodemus . He wiped his wet brow with his sleeve . Their garments were blowing . The snow that glittered and wheeled on the lighted steps was drifting in here too . They moved with one accord to the deeper shelter of the arcade . " Things seem to be getting worse every time you come to a feast . The Sanhedrin out to get you  --  and now this ! " The Sanhedrin has n't succeeded either , " Jesus reminded him . " Thank you for your help , Nicodemus , " he said , gratefully . " But as a Pharisee in good standing , you ca n't go on defending me . " Nicodemus shook his head . " I have to speak out , just as you do . Yes , Caiaphas is furious  --  and he will do what he pleases , no matter what anybody says . But the high priest is n't the only one , or the Sanhedrin either . For every Jew that loves you there are a hundred who would kill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you keep returning to Jerusalem , " he begged , " knowing the hostility here ? Much as I love you and long to see you , it frightens me , for one day they will succeed . I had hoped you were still safely preaching somewhere in Galilee . " " This is my city too , it is sacred to me . " " Very well , yes , come if you must . " Nicodemus sighed andp173pressed his arm . " But where are your bodyguards ? " He looked anxiouslyaround . " Are they not with you this time ? " " The twelve are not my bodyguards , " Jesus corrected , " but my apostles . They have more important things to do . " " What could be more important than protecting you ? " " Healing , teaching , carrying on my work for me . " " Well , whoever they are , they should be with you ! " " I do n't ask them to go everywhere with me , " Jesus told him . " Especially to Jerusalem right now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use in subjecting them to unnecessary risks  --  some of them have families . " He was shivering , hugging himself in his threadbare cloak , stamping his feet to keep warm  --  they were almost naked , Nicodemusnoticed . But his face was cheerful . Nicodemus winced , hurting for him , and feeling frustrated . This tall , handsome prince of a man was so fair and fascinating he turned heads even when he walked unrecognized in the streets ; yet clad so humbly , usually in simple white homespun , with some kind of nondescriptcloak when needed . Clean , pleasant , yes  --  it became him  --  but scarcely the kind of attire to attract the attention and approbation of people whose opinions counted . The members of the Sanhedrin were the aristocracy ; they dressed well , lived in fine homes . How could Nicodemus expect to convince them they should listen to the remarkable things this young teacher was saying ? That his claims , however incredible they might sound , were true and they should pay him serious heed ? They dismissed the very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , let alone lead them into the kingdom ? Ludicrous . They were men of substance . The last thing most of them wanted was a messiah , upsettingthe system . But if and when the true One ever came , he would surely be at least their equal , not some poor peasant without even a decent pair of boots . Concerned , but with a kind of pitying impatience , Nicodemus glanced again at Jesus ' feet . He had tried to press money on him , urging him to buy a fine wardrobe , but Jesus had only laughed . " No , Nicodemus . Give your money to the poor , as I command . I low can I ask others to sacrifice worldly possessions unless I 'm willing to do so myself ? " Now Nicodemus sighed , but his keen , kindly eyes shone withp174eagerness and affection . " Come home with me , " he invited . " We will celebrate your safety this last night of the feast . Joseph of Arimathea will be there too  --  he 's another defender of yours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I will rest better if I know you are fed and out of the cold . " Jesus smiled , " I will be well fed , " he reassured him , " thanks to you . I 've promised Lazarus and his sisters to spend the night with them . " " Good , that makes me happy . A fine man , Lazarus . I 'm so glad you 're friends . The kind you should be cultivating , " he added . " But it 's cold and still snowing . " Nicodemus indicated the swirling veils that nearly obscured the street . " Let me at least send my servants with a litter to carry you to Bethany . " " No , though I appreciate your offer . I could never ask other men to bear me on their shoulders . " " A carriage , then ? " Nicodemus persisted . " I want to be sure you get there safely . " Jesus shook his head . " That wo n't be necessary . " They embraced in parting , and stood holding each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about me needlessly . Though I love you for it , I would spare you . I must accomplish my mission . No harm can come to me until my work on earth is finished . " Nicodemus drew back , his gentle face working . " And then ? " he whispered . " I can not tell you , " Jesus said gravely . " Only that you must not worry . There is nothing that you or anyone can do to prevent it . " It was dark by the time Jesus reached the house of Lazarus . He could see its lights beckoning brightly from every window , and make out the figure of Mary peering from the doorway as he climbed the final steps . " He 's here , he 's here ! " Mary called out joyfully . " He 's coming up the steps ! " Lazarus appeared behind her , and came leaping down through the snow to meet him , arms outstretched . " You 're late . We 've been worried . Peace be with you ! " The women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covered him , smiling to behold him . He was here , safely here , their friend , their darling , almost a member of the family , and more , ap175famous guest . People talked of Jesus wherever you went ; a thrill ( ) l wonder pierced them that he had chosen their home as his refugeAnd tonight  --  although they also enjoyed his comrades  --  they hrahl him all to themselves . Martha stepped back for a moment , breathing deeply to steady herself . Silently , then , she took his wet cloak and carried it outside that she might shake the snow from it . The night was white and still , with a new moon shining . The wind had quieted suddenly and the snow seemed to be resting ; only a few flakes still coasted down , feeling delicate and cool on her flushed cheeks . Vigorously Martha shook the heavy wrap . Heart pounding , she held its precious weight against her breast a moment before carrying it back inside . Moving in her graceful , gliding way , Martha hung the cloak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The others were already in animated conversation . Jesus had been explaining why he was late , and Lazarus was questioning him further . Evidently there had been some trouble in Jerusalem . Martha was torn ; she was anxious to hear more  --  and would later  --  but supper could not wait . Smiling nervously , she excused herself and hastened to her kitchen . Fragments of conversation trailed her : " But why , why ? When they can see for themselves all the marvelous works you are doing . " " It 's not what I do , but what I say . They accuse me of heresy , even treason . " Martha gasped . How could they ? There seemed to be some mysterious plot to silence him . It could n't succeed , of course , but the very thought was chilling . The awful threat to Jesus  --  and to them . But she must pay attention to what she was doing . Protecting her hands with her apron , Martha lifted the meat on its spit . But it was heavy ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the platter . And it was much too done she despaired  --  falling apart . The vegetables would have to be reheated , their sauces added . Where were the olives and cheeses ? Oh , yes , Mary had attended to them  --  she hoped . Martha checked the long low table , so pretty in the lamplight with its linen cloth . Mary had put flowers in an ornate glass in the center  --  a nice touch , but they crowded things . Martha 's long hands were trembling as she placed them firmly on a chest . Where was Mary ? Still talking with the men , of course . Oh , well , no matter ; really now , be honest  --  you 'd rather do it yourself . Mary gets underfoot . Martha gavep176a fond if exasperated little laugh . And oh , the secret joy of preparing food for Jesus ! Martha worked as fast as she could . The coals were sputtering and smoking from the grease . She was beginning to feel hot and sweaty . Her black hair , parted so precisely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way atop her narrow head , was coming down ; she could feel strands of it on her neck and her perspiring brow . And now look , she had spilled the sauce ! She felt it splash hot on one thigh , and saw to her horror the brown stain on her dress : her best white embroidered dress , worn only on special occasions . No , no , she could not manage alone ; it was all too much . Mary should be out here helping ! Listen to her : Mary 's lilting voice could be heard above those of the men , sweet and fervent , unrestrained . Marthastiffened , taut with listening , the way she lay sometimes at night . Feeling lonely and somehow betrayed . Forgotten , unimportant  --  Marthapushed back her hair and glanced bleakly around her kitchen  --  and yes , suddenly , cruelly old . Resentment rose within her , a devouringpain . No , now stop this , do n't spoil things ! But it hurt , it hurt , became bitterness , a fury of emotions she could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minute , then threw down the wet cloth . This was intolerable . Mouth tight , eyes flashing , Martha glided back into the common room to confront them . The sight of the three so deep in conversation held her speechless for a minute . The room was bathed in the soft glow of lamplight ; there was the sound of coals ticking in the copper brazier , and a sense of the whispering snow outside . Jesus half reclined on a low couch as he spoke ; Lazarus was perched on a nearby chair , leaning forward , claspinghis knees , an expression of intense listening on his keen , sharpfeaturedface . Martha saw with a little stab that someone had removed the bouquet of flowers from the chest where she had just put them ; they were now on a small table beside Jesus . Mary , of course ; for her sister was seated on a silken cushion , her small chin cupped in one hand , the other holding a rose ; while her beautiful hair spilled over her shoulders . In this light it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glittering and flaming . Again that little stab of pain , then deeper , sharper , fiercer . Martha blinked rapidly , for now she realized , with a kind of blind hopeless sense of futility , that while she was toiling in the kitchen Mary had once againp177performed for Jesus that lovely , womanly , but somehow so abandoned rite to honor him . " Forgive me , Lord , " Martha broke in  --  she could restrain herself no longer  --  " but it 's growing late , and the meal not yet served . I really need Mary to help me . " Mary looked up , her radiant eyes contrite . " In a minute , " she pleaded eagerly . " This is so important . I want to hear what Jesus is saying about eternal life . " She turned back to him . " Life is so wonderful , I want to live forever ! But I have always heard from the Sadducees , men like my brother "  --  she smiled at Lazarus  --  " that there is no resurrection , life ends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Father does not want us to perish , He will raise us up if we follow your commandments . You have already toed us many things , tell us more . What can we do to inherit eternal life ? " " Not my commandments , " Jesus reaffirmed quietly , " but God 's . My teaching is not mine , but that of him who sent me . To enjoy eternal life , simply begin with the greatest of all commandments : You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart , and with all your soul and with all your strength , and with all your mind . And the second , which is like unto it : You shall love your neighbor as yourself . " " What about your sister ? " Martha exploded , to her own astonishment . Her voice shook with indignation ; her whole body was trembling . She stiffened herself against it , her fists locked tight at her sides . " If my sister really loved me , she would be in the kitchen helping prepare your supper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left me to do all the work alone ? " There was a moment of shocked silence . A branch scraped against the window ; they were aware of the snow and the rosy clucking of the coals . " Martha . . . Martha ! " Jesus exclaimed in sad surprise , getting to his feet . He stood above her , his dark eyes filled with affection and concern . " Dear Martha , " he remonstrated gently , " you are troubledabout too many things . Men and women do n't live by bread alone , we also must have food for the spirit . " He held both her hands and squeezed them to comfort her , but his voice was positive . " What Mary has chosen is the better thing . " " Better ? " Martha gasped . Her face , flushed from the kitchen , had gone white at his reproof . Her teeth bit fiercely into her lower lip to still its trembling  | " Yes , " Jesus went on , " for it 's not what we eat that is important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mary took the sponge from Lazarus to bathe my feet , and she let down her hair that she might dry them . She went into her garden to pick its last late flowers to place beside me . But the greatest tribute of all she has always paid me , and that has been simply to sit and listen to my words . " Martha burst into tears . They stared at her incredulous as she stood weeping , hugging herself yet trying to hide her head in her arms ; pathetic and terrible with her straggling hair and her racking sobs . They were stricken ; they had never seen her like this  --  not Martha , always so poised and preoccupied , seemingly devoid of emotion save for her bubbling pots and recipes . Suddenly Martha threw back her head and faced Jesus , with the tears still running down her cheeks . " I love you , Master ! " she wailed brokenly . " Take me with you . I will give up everything for you , everything  --  mysister Mary , even my beloved brother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so to me , not when I have worked so hard to please you ! " Jesus was gazing at her , deeply troubled . " Martha , forgive me , " he said kindly . " You know I would never want to hurt you . " He held out his arms to console her , but she wrenched away . " Those flowers ! " Martha accused . Her eyes were blazing with a resentment Mary and Lazarus realized must have been smoldering for years . " Is their fragrance sweeter than the aroma of the meat I have cooked for you ? Is that bouquet more beautiful than the table I have set ? It should be , for Mary spent half the day arranging it while I slaved in the kitchen . Look at these hands , " she demanded , and spread them before him . " See that blister ? It came from a burn as I was trying to make the oven burn hotter . See that scar ? " She panted . " I cut myself while preparing the roast  --  and there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no , my hands are not smooth and white like Mary 's , and you will find no rings upon them . Why ? Because you have urged us to sell whatever we can and give to the poor . See , I do listen to you . Even as I work , I hear more than you think . I have sold my jewelry , what little I had , and given to the poor . For you ! " " Martha , Martha , " Jesus was murmuring over and over as she wailed , beside herself . " Dear , dear friend . . . " He caught one of her frantically gesturing hands , which were indeed touchingly work/scarred , and held it affectionately , but with great firmness , to quiet her . He pressed it against his breast . " My heart is full of love for you - all of you ; full almost to bursting because of the beauty and comfort of this home . It is my refuge , it nourishes my body and my soul . But it grieves me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work , and arouse such conflict and pain within you . " Martha straightened suddenly , went whiter still with fear . What if he did not come again ? What if her outburst should drive him away ? She could not bear it . With a long moaning shudder , she drew back . Still gasping her breath , she accepted a handkerchief from Mary and began to dry her eyes . " Oh , oh , oh , " she whispered , " I am so ashamed ! " " You are very tired , " Jesus said with compassion . " I understand , because I am very tired myself . Come , let us eat the wonderful meal you have prepared , then you must take your rest . " " Yes . " Lazarus spoke up quickly . " It will restore us . We will laugh and sing and pray as always . Then  --  it 's late  --  all of us must get a good night 's rest . " Mary had put her arms around her sister , tender and solicitous , murmuring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will do all the serving , " she insisted . " You are not to do anything ; you must sit down and be served with the men . " " No , no . " Martha finished blowing her nose . " I would n't think of it . The flowers are  --  beautiful , " she choked . " You did right to place them beside him . Now let us put them back on the table . " She realized she might be incoherent , for she was still shaking , poking futilely at the dissarray of her hair : still appalled at her own behavior yet curiouslyat peace , as if she had been delivered from demons that had tormented her far too long . But most of all , delivered of something glorious  --  her love for Jesus . She had carried it in secret , but now she had borne it for him like a child , given it over to him to be received . She did not ask his love in return , only that he accept what she had delivered in such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt so happy and so free . Mary had hurried to the kitchen ; and , to spare Martha , Lazarus too had left the room . She was alone with Jesus . She turned to him now , smiling , composed , direct . " I do love you , " she informed him simply . Her eyesp180glistened with the innocent candor of her feelings . " I would follow you to the ends of the earth if you asked me . " " Dear Martha , " Jesus said , and covered his eyes . His heart bled . For he remembered those same words cried out in such desperation by a peasant girl on the hillside with her sheep . The one woman whom God in his infinite grace and wisdom had given him to love . He remembered that pure bright rapture that was never to be fulfilled ; he remembered the terrible pain of parting . And he thanked God for it : that the Father had created his son to be human  --  man as well as Son of Man , sent to earth to live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and so to experience that most important , beautiful , yet agonizing of all human experiences , human love . Jesus knew what Martha was feeling . He could share her suffering . Martha rushed on bravely . " You have told us there are sometimes women with you in Galilee . Peter 's wife and others . I would be one of them . Take me with you , let me serve you ! " Jesus was shaking his head , though his face shone with gratitude . " Martha , Martha , you are needed here , " he told her warmly . " Your brother and sister need you ; and I need you too , right where you are . This house would not be the same without you . What would I do without your wonderful food that is always waiting for me ? Or the kind thoughtful things you do to make me welcome ? " Smiling , Jesus took both her work-scarred hands and kissed them . " These dear hands are already serving me . They have made this house my home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Martha managed a faint smile too , though her eyes were wet . Nodding , she drew a deep sigh and returned the pressure of his clasp . A part of her was disappointed , but she was also weak with relief . She felt safe , and cleansed , and free . She had told him . Risked everything to make her statement and confirm it ; but now she was safe , she need not leave . She could stay on in her own little world , warm and secure , awaiting his coming . She had made this a house of love for him , he had said so . Whenever she was lonely , she would think of his words and be comforted . Later , when the sisters had gone to bed , Lazarus and Jesus went outdoors to gaze down upon the city , glittering under its rare mantle of snow . The storm had ceased , the air turned warm once more , andp181now only a delicate furring still covered the ground . But on all the square rooftops below them the snow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tablecloths . The bare trees and shrubs that clung to the Mount of Olives were like guests in ermine coming to the banquet ; and when the wind stirred , dancers in gossamer veils drifted up and down the countless tiers of steps . It was very quiet . The slender new moon cradled a star . Lights were bright in all the little houses . In the distance , beyond its great dark walls , they could see the massive towers and domes of Jerusalem , almost all of them aglow . In the center , the golden crown of the Templeshone , its spires now delicate as wands against the soft blue-silver sky . Brushing snow from the wall , Lazarus hoisted himself upon it . He sat there a moment , gazing out over the lovely scene , but his black brows were frowning . " Jesus , I brought you out here to talk , lest Martha hear us , " he said . " I hope her outburst did n't offend you . She meant nothing by it . Martha works very hard to please others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes her happier than preparing for your visits . It would break her heart if you found her words reason not to come again . " " And mine , " Jesus echoed quickly . He pulled himself up beside Lazarus . A few steps down the hill , in their terraced garden , Mary 's last late-blooming roses lifted their bright heads above the snow . " Few men are as dear to me as you are , Lazarus . Even my own brothers . " Lazarus regarded him , still frowning . " Your brothers do n't supportyou , do they ? I have never seen them with you . " " My brothers support me in their own way ; they would fight to the death for me . But they are not yet ready to believe in me . " " Ca n't your mother persuade them ? She knows who you are : she gave you life . I do wish I could know her . I have heard her beautiful story from Nicodemus . " " It 's been very difficult for her . And my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things are simply beyond their comprehension . " " Tell me more about your mother . " " She is ... wonderful , " Jesus said helplessly , with a little laugh . " She saddles up the donkey herself sometimes and comes riding out to find me . Often stays a few days helping the women who attend top182us in the country . Not here , usually , " he added . " Jerusalem is too far for most of them to come , and we do n't need them so much here . " " How many women ? " " Five or six . Sometimes more , sometimes less  --  they come and go . " Jesus named the most dependable , and described some of their adventures . " It 's a hard life on the road . Few women could stand it  --  certainly not Martha , I 'm afraid . I hope she realizes that 's why I brushed aside her offer . I was not rejecting her . " " That 's really what I wanted to discuss , " said Lazarus . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does love you  --  how much I had no idea . I would never have believed she could speak so to any man ! But I assure you she meant only the purest kind of love . " " 1 know that , " Jesus said , " and I am honored . Love is so precious , any declaration of love should be honored and cherished , for it is a precious thing . " " But many women must love you , " Lazarus reasoned , in honest admiration . " How can they help it ? Mary does too . I can see it in her eyes  --  and in the eyes of women everywhere you go . " Lazarus pondered , frowning , chin in hand . " Forgive me , Rabbi , but as a Jew who has always kept the Law , why have n't you taken a wife and had children , as the Law commands ? Do n't you believe in God 's first commandment , to be fruitful and multiply ? " Jesus shivered . It was growing cold . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unleashing a pain and longing he had thought he would never feel again . He wanted to confide in Lazarus , to speak of it at last , for never had he felt closer to any man . But he knew he could not , dared not , for once the name of Tamara crossed his lips he would be undone . He smiled faintly . " Lazarus , your question is natural , especially since a rabbi is supposed to set a good example . I 'll answer with the words from the old rabbinic parable of the unmarried rabbi who was challenged by his students about this very obligation : ' I can only say that my soul is enamored of the Torah , and the world can be populated by others . ' " Jesus paused . " Seriously , there is nothing I would like better , were I just a normal man . But my mission is such that it can not include a home and family . It would not be fair to them  --  or to thep183purpose for which I came . Meanwhile , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or woman , let us rejoice , for it is not to my glory but to his . " They sat silent for a moment , gazing down on the panorama of rooftops and the sparkling city beyond . " Never have I seen Jerusalem more beautiful , " said Lazarus . " Or the Temple so radiant . It seems to shine with a special light . " Jesus nodded . But when he replied , his voice was both ironic and sorrowing . " Let it shine on as long as it can , " he said . " For the time is coming when it will be plunged into darkness with the rest of the city ; when nothing will be left of the Temple , not one stone . See all those buildings ? " he continued , with a broad sweep of his hand , as Lazarus gasped . " The Antonia Fortress , the citadels and towers , Herod'spalace there against the sky  --  that fox , he will no longer have a place for his lechery and murders , for it , too , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But not the Temple ! " Lazarus protested . " Yes , the very Temple . Every corridor and colonnade , every marblestep , every lavish gate , all its rich adornments , its silver and gold and precious gems  --  all , all will be thrown down , destroyed utterly ; nothing will be left standing , not so much as a single stone . " " But why ? " demanded Lazarus . " In the name of the One we worship there , whose own presence dwells in the Holy Sanctum , why would he let such a thing happen ? Why would he not protect it ? " " The Temple must fall , " said Jesus . " The Temple is destroying itself . It will fall by the weight of its own corruption . And the City of David with it . " " But I thought you loved Jerusalem and the Temple ! " " I would lay down my life for them , " said Jesus . " That is why I grieve for them , because they will not listen to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are enjoying now , Lazarus  --  it is doomed . It will vanish , and there is nothing I can do to save it . " Lazarus stared at him , astounded . " When will this be ? " he asked . He was a practical man , a man of action . " If this is true , then I must be ready . I must protect my sisters  --  we must be prepared to flee ! " Jesus was shaking his head ; he made a little gesture of restraint . " I did n't mean to frighten you , or even to warn you . Only to confide in you what I know will be . But when  --  even I do n't know . " " What can we do ? " Lazarus persisted , still alarmed.  | " Do n't worry ; go on living as you have . Enjoy life , love your sisters , keep the commandments , feed the poor , comfort the sick and those in prison , welcome the stranger as you have welcomed me . For in doing all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Live so that when that hour comes , you will have nothing to fear . If you truly believe in me , I promise you will be spared . " The snow was falling again , the wind rising . Brushing at their garments , they went back into the house . Only two lamps burned now , casting shadows . " Where will you be ? " Lazarus asked anxiously . Jesus stood thoughtful , arms folded , gazing into the dying coals . Finally he raised his eyes . " I do n't know that either , " he said . " Only that the time is growing short before I must leave you . " " Well , wherever you go , be careful , " Lazarus pleaded . " Though we will miss you , stay out of Jerusalem until things are quieter . " Their eyes held ; they were bound by a sense of love and foreboding . " Nothingmust happen to you , " he cried softly . " We love you so much , all three of us . We could n't bear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jesus fervently . He reached out to press his friend 's hand . " Take care of yourself , dear Lazarus , for I have loved few people as I love you . "  |p185THE  courier had hoped to find Jesus in Jericho . Jesus would surely be there , the frantic sisters had told him , for that had been their friend 's destination when last they had seen him . True , that was some weeks ago ; he and his men might have moved on , but seek him first in Jericho . " But find him , only find him as fast as you can . Give him this message : Our brother is ill . The one whom he loves so much is gravely ill . He must come ! " The boy was already breathless from climbing the hill to this great house in such urgency at night . The house was warm and enticing , despite its atmosphere of crisis . He sensed the beauty of a bedroom where one light burned , and the charm of a pretty woman sitting by a bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door with the tears streaming down her cheeks . " Tell him we need him ! " The older sister handed him a small parcel , already efficiently prepared , containing a letter of instructions , some money in case he needed it , and a little food . Her pleasant face was still distraught , but now she seemed composed . " You may get hungry , " she said kindly . " Eat when you can . " She mentioned the names of several people in Jericho who might know Jesus ' whereabouts . The boy listened carefully , feeling his responsibility to these graciouswomen in their fine house which he had often admired from a distance . He assured them he would stop for nothing . Yes , it was a rough journey through the mountains , but he knew shortcuts ; he had run it a number of times in just a few hours . He realized he wanted their admiration almost as much as he wanted to reassure them . He was a poor boy , proud of his running , lean and strapping , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cat . He had won every race he entered , beaten even a few Greeks and Romans . Tucking the parcel in his girdle , he set off , his long legs streaking along alleys and through rocky fields until he reached the highway , then pacing himself as he climbed and descended through the starry night . The skies were brilliant , with a strong moon rising ; he had the eyes of a jackal , and no fear of falling . He was pleased and excited . To be entrusted with a message for the famous healer ! He might even be lucky enough to accompany Jesus back . Though it would be nice to linger in Jericho , the luxurious winter capital of Herod and his son , a playground of the wealthy . It was warm there , like summer compared to Jerusalem . He thought of them , sunning themselves under the palm trees or wallowing in the Roman baths while other people froze or starved . . . . The youth , whose name was Caleb , entertained himself with fantasies of such a life , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a poor man himself , people said , who hobnobbed with both the rabble and the rich . By the time Caleb reached the outskirts of Jericho , he realized it had been folly to take off at such an hour and run so fast , whatever the emergency . The city , known for its merriment far into the night , was still sleeping ; only a few scattered lights burned among the hills and in occasional windows . The strange palm-lined streets were dark and silent , though the skies were beginning to gray . Caleb was panting ; his side had begun to hurt . He could accomplish nothing until morning . He walked along slowly , and looked about for a place to rest . To his surprise , he could hear a fountain spilling its frail music from a leafy copse nearby . Exhausted , he flung himself down on the grass . He would eat the food the woman Martha had given him , and cheer himself by listening to the clashing of palm fronds and the sweet liquid sounds of the fountain until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was shaking him , hands were cuffing his bewildered face . " Wake up , give an account of yourself ! " A boot kicked him into consciousness ; he could feel the metal of a Roman breastplate as a soldier yanked him to his feet . " Where am I ? " Caleb muttered stupidly , blinking . To his dismay , the sky was rosy overhead ; light glinted on the solder 's helmet . He could hear roosters crowing and the rattle of carts on a nearby street . " You 're on palace grounds , you idiot ! " the soldier barked . He wasp187a ruddy-faced , thick-lipped youth , not much older than Caleb . " What are you doing here ? " " I 'm a runner from Bethany , with an important message to deliver . I got lost and fell asleep . " " Then your message must be for Herod ? " The tall young soldier was scowling , eyeing him suspiciously . " No . Oh , no , " Caleb corrected hastily . " I 'm seeking a man named @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Jesus ? " The young guard gasped , then threw back his head and howled in disbelief . " Well , you wo n't find him here ! " He looked over his shoulder , and lowering his voice , grinned wryly . " At least I hope not , or he may find his head on a plate for breakfast . " The guard continued to stare at him as Caleb laughed uncomfortably . " Are you one of that rebel 's followers ? If so , you found a strange place to sleep . " " No , I 'm simply a courier , " Caleb pleaded , heart hammering . " Sent to tell him one of his friends is very ill , it 's urgent that he return at once to Bethany . Here , I have a letter to prove it . " Desperately Caleb fumbled in his girdle for the parcel ; to his horror , it was not there . Then he spied it , fallen where he had opened it under the tree . But even as he retrieved it and produced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to anyone associated with the king . Caleb himself had not read it ; he made it a point of honor not to do such things . Yet now it occurred to him  --  what if it contained some word that might offend the monsi:er ? And had or had n't the woman named Martha also given him a list of people he might contact in Jericho ? Cursing himself for a fool , he watched the soldier unroll the scroll and scan it briefly . To his relief , the guard handed it back withoutasking to see anything more . " Sorry I had to be so rough . " He stood , hands on his hips , imposing in his uniform , but no longer sinister . " I had to make sure . " Again that cynical grin as he glanced in the direction of the dazzling complex of buildings on the hill above them . Their eyes met , with an unspoken disgust . They were aware of the palace stirring , servants coming and going , wagons of foodstuffs arriving , the clang of great iron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the winding road that led to the street . Guard and messenger felt , as one , its aura of luxury and licentious/ness . Even some of the Romans who served Herod were shamed by the vileness and cruelty he represented . " Have you any idea where I might look for Jesus ? I was told he might be staying with friends in Jericho . " Caleb felt he could trust the young guard now . He had already lost too much time ; he must have some clues and be on his way . " Perhaps you know where some of them live . " " If I knew I would n't dare tell you , and I do n't advise you to go asking for them . Word travels . It could put them under suspicion , and you too . This Jesus also has a lot of enemies . " The ruddy young guard pushed back his helmet , obviously concerned . " I can tell you this much : He was here , he and his band  --  what 're they called  --  apostles ? 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggest you move on , up north along the Jordan , somewhere in the vicinity where  --  " He halted , hating to say the name . " Where that other one that was preaching and baptizing got into so much trouble , " he said grimly . " John the Baptist ? " Caleb blurted . " Surely they ca n't be baptizing this time of year . The water up there must still be muddy and cold . " This struck the young Roman funny . He suddenly threw back his head and laughed . " But I hear this one 's a miracle worker . If so , maybe he 's warming the water ! " Caleb laughed too . They stood grinning at each other a moment , discussing his mission and wishing each other well , before he dusted himself off and hurried on . At first the brisk morning air revived him , along with a few remainingmouthfuls of Martha 's bread , which he munched as he loped through the waking city . Those nice women , concerned for his comfort even in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible and bring him back in time to help their brother . If only Jesus had been in Jericho ! The sooner the return to Bethany was started the better . It was still some distance to the river . Caleb realized he must pace himself if he was to last the day ; he was very tired , but he dared not pause to rest lest he fall asleep . By asking questions of fellow travelers , he learned that Jesus had been staying in a small town also named Bethany  --  Bethany beyond the Jordan  --  but was holding services on the river to the north . Doggedly the boy trudged on , turning north when he finally reached the river . The water roared by , gray and swollen after the winter rains ;  |p189it  looked uninviting even though it shone silver in the noon sun . These last miles were hardest of all , plowing through thickets and over rocks , along paths that were often spongy , for the river had overflowed its banks in places ; he must detour , circle its serpentine course . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surely within the hour , he would find the famous Jesus ; actually see him and have the honor of deliveringin person a message that , however grave , he must have in order to hasten at once to the aid of his friends . Finally , in midafternoon , Caleb could hear voices above the sound of the water . And clambering over the last rock , pushing aside the branches , he came upon a clearing where many people were gathered . He rested , breathing hard , and awed by the scene : Below them , two men stood in the river . They were baptizing , he realized . Men and women were coming up out of the water , being dried and embraced by others , rejoicing . The crowd was singing and praising God . Some were laughing , some weeping . An air of great joy prevailed . And it came to him that Jesus was somewhere among them , and that many miracles of healing had occurred here today . Even the water ! he realized , with a shock . Here it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blue and sparkling in the sun , sweet and clean . The soldier 's jest , at which both had laughed so heartily , was no longer funny . Shaken , almost overcome with excitement and anticipation , Caleb made his way across the grass . People waylaid him to proclaim their healings . " I can see , I can see ! " an old man shouted . " You , boy  --  you with the torn shirt  --  are you my grandson come to lead me home ? No , no , my grandson would never look so muddy and worn , though it 's a miracle to see anyone after so long . You are beautiful , lad , the whole world is beautiful ! I can find my own way home . " Many were weeping with joy as they pointed to the white-robed man a little way up the hill . Caleb breathed a prayer of thanks . He was almost weeping himself . He did n't think he could have waited much longer to deliver his message ; it was all he could do to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had known . He turned away from Peter , Judas and several others with whom he was conferring and watched the young figure hurrying to him up the slope . He held out his arms to catch the panting boy when hep190stumbled . " He has come a long way , " Jesus told them in a voice of quiet authority . " He is very weary . Give him something to eat . " To Caleb 's amazement , he felt himself cradled against a strong hard breast . The body was warm and tough and real ; he could even hear the great heart beating . And when he looked up , he saw not the face of a god , as he had somehow imagined , but a face that was very human  --  the kindest , most beautiful and tender face he had ever seen . With an effort Caleb pulled away ; it seemed to him , incredibly , that he had slept a long sweet sleep , from which he wished never to waken . " No , Master , " he protested , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have an important message for you , from two sisters in Bethany . Their brother is ill . They have sent me to tell you that the one whom you love is very ill . " Jesus gave a little start ; though this , too , he had known . His eyes filled with tears . But his face remained strangely inscrutable . To Caleb 's surprise , he did not reply . " Here , I bear a letter for you . " Puzzled , Caleb fumbled in his girdle . " Perhaps you will realize , when you read it  --  " To his dismay , Jesus only nodded , took the scroll woodenly and walked slowly away with it , across the hill . The other men crowded anxiously around the courier , asking questions . Lazarus was their friend too  --  how bad was he ? Jesus would want to leave at once ; they would hire donkeys in the village , better yet horses , if they could be found  --  with horses , Jesus could reach him before midnight . One of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foot . . . . Troubled , they looked to where Jesus stood alone with his letter , gazing into the distance . He returned at last , sober and thoughtful . Finally he spoke , and they were astonished at his words . " When you have eaten and rested , " Jesus told Caleb , " go back to Bethany with this message . Tell Martha and Mary that though I long to be with them to comfort them , I can not just yet . I will come later . Meanwhile , they are not to worry about their brother , Lazarus . " There was stunned silence . " But they would n't have sent for you if it were n't serious ! " Peter blurted . " We must go at once . You , Master , at least . Please go , while there is still time to save him ! " The boy was dumbfounded . To have run so far , made such an effort , for this ? He could n't believe it . " Rabbi , forgive me , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speak . The women were distraught ; they 're convincedtheir brother is dying . " His voice broke . " I do n't think I could face them without some hope that you will arrive without delay ! " Jesus listened to him gravely . He turned then and stood for a time with his eyes closed , the scroll pressed against his lips . Finally he drew a deep painful breath ; throwing back his shoulders , he faced them . His words had a ring of conviction they could not comprehend . " Tell Martha and Mary to trust me , " he told the boy . " For this sickness is not unto death , but unto the glory of God . Assure them it has a meaningthat one day will be revealed . " Firmly , to encourage him , Jesus squeezed the boy 's arm . " Tell the women their brother Lazarus , whom we love , will come to no harm because of it . " Caleb backed away , too shocked to reply . In his bewilderment he stared bleakly for an instant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their miracles !  --  and his mouth went bitter with disillusionmentand doubt . Poor ignorant fools , how soon would they find out they , too , had been deluded ? If the man could really perform such wonders , would n't he fly at once to help someone he loved ? So this was the famous healer ! Caleb was too angry and hurt to accept food in this place , or even rest . With a little sob , he fled . And his anger gave him strength . He plunged back to Jericho , where he spent some of the women 's money on wine and a night at the inn . He did not even climb the steps to the home of Lazarus until the following day . And when at last , cringing with guilt , he approached that imposing house set high on the Mount of Olives , and saw the face of the woman at the door , he knew it did n't matter anyway . Lazarus was dead . Jesus moved , those next few days , through such pain as he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Telling his apostles to wait for him in the village , he paced the banks of the river alone , praying about Lazarus , and haunted by memories of John . John 's fierce-bright face beaming upon him that day of his baptism , John 's voice shouting the message : " Behold the Lamb of God , for he is standingamong you even now ! " Despite his anguish , Jesus smiled . There was something faintly comical about John , presenting him to the masses like some prize fish : the Christ , the long-predicted catch ! John ,  |p192the  defiant , his ministry so quickly over . . . and mine , begun on these same banks that spring day , drawing to its close .. . The pain of the young courier 's disappointment hung heavy on his spirit , as well as the dissension among the apostles , who were mystified at this seemingly useless delay . He knew they were debating it among themselves , some of them very upset . Peter had been appalled . " Lazarus , of all people ! " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't understand it . If he refuses Lazarus , what about us ? What if it was me or my wife ? What if it was one of us ? " He had flung himself down on the floor of the inn beside the twins and mumbled about it with them until the rest growled for silence . James was all for action . Jesus himself had sent them on healingmissions ; why could n't they set out ? John was less sure . It would be foolish to go without Jesus ' approval , and what if something happened to them ? That would only make things worse for everyone . In the morning the others joined in , puzzled and torn , but apprehensive . Most of them sided with Judas , who finally took charge ; in his coolly superior way , Judas was able to convince them . " Do n't questionthe Master , " he ordered impatiently . " Jesus knows what 's best for us . It is n't safe for any of us to go back to Jerusalem yet . Remember what happens every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . Not only the Sanhedrin , that 's bad enough , but now even some of the people . They tried to stone him the last time ! He could have been killed , and us too , if we 'd been along . " " But Lazarus is his friend ! " " Lazarus is in no danger , " Judas stated flatly . " Did n't you hear what Jesus told that courier ? No , Jesus was n't abandoning Lazarus ; it hurts him not to go to his aid . But we are his friends too ; he realizes it 's more important right now to protect us . " And it seemed to Jesus poignant that , of them all , only Judas should suspect even faintly what he was enduring . His greatest anguish was for Martha and Mary . The scene of Lazarus ' death was vivid before him . He had longed with every impulse to run forward to meet the boy , take his hand even before he could speak , and rush back to Bethany with him to comfort the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suffering , as he had done for so many others.  |p193Yet  he was powerless to move  --  at that moment , or now . He must not , he could not . There was a reason for this delay , a purpose beyond anything the Father had yet designed for him to accomplish . This , his last , greatest miracle , must await the Father 's bidding . Finally , early on the morning of the third day , Jesus roused his apostles . The time had come . He had been alone by the river the night long , praying . Now he knew what he must do . He stood regarding them , these big rough men sprawled about like logs on the floor of the inn , but also somehow like children . His heart ached for them . " Wake up , little flock , " he said whimsically , and went about shaking them . " Wash , say your prayers , have a bite and let 's be off . For we are going back to Bethany . " They sat up , yawning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was almost daylight ; roosters were crowing . They could smell the bread from the ovens in the courtyard below . To their surprise , Jesus seemed brisk and cheerful , though they knew he had spent another night pacing the river , in meditation . He had bathed and refreshed himself , he told them , by taking a long cold swim . Puzzled , they scrambled to their feet , stretched mightily , and beganshaking out the cloaks that had been rolled under their heads for pillows , or wrapped about their bodies to keep warm . They had been restless ; it was a relief to be in action , but why had the Lord changed his mind ? Mumbling in surprise , groping about for belts and sandals , they exchanged questioning glances , and looked reluctantly to Judas for guidance . He was obviously taken aback , the small white scar on his olive face twitching . " But , Master , can it be safe yet ? " Judas protested , for all of them . In a smooth , swift gesture that somehow bespoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Why should we go back where the Jews might seek our lives again ? " " There are twelve hours in the day to worry about such things , " Jesus said , for all to hear . His smile was reassuring . " But if a man walk in the light he need n't be afraid . I am the light ; you can walk safely with me . " Thomas looked up from lacing his sandals . " But why go now ? " he asked anxiously . " Is Lazarus worse ? " " I am concerned for Lazarus , " Jesus acknowledged after a minute . He beckoned them all to draw nearer , and now his eyes and his voicep194were serious . " If any of you are afraid , then stay , " he told them . " Although I urge you not to . For your own sakes , I want you to be with me . But whatever you do , I must go now to be with our friend and his sisters . " They set off shortly , bypassing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across the barren rocky hills of the wilderness . All day they walked , murmuring among themselves , but mostly in silence , for the road was narrow and winding , snaking up and down , through ravines , along the rim of canyons and above deep wadis . A pall of dread was upon them , and the landscape did little to cheer them ; this was a desolate place , lonely and deserted , with few signs of life except for the coneys that scurried among the jagged rocks , the vultures hovering overhead , and here and there wild goats rambling . Now and then one of the creatures would come to a halt and stare at them curiously from a boulder . Jesus led the way , striding alone some distance ahead , much as he had on the day when Peter , James and John had climbed the mountain with him . They spoke of it privately , marveling and speculating ; feeling that again some very important experience could be impending . Judas looked grim . Twice he marched impatiently forward , determined to catch up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he fell back , his olive face flushed with defeat . With his usual cheerful arrogance , he simply threw up his hands for the benefit of the others . But they could not forget his warnings . Judas was right , they knew from experience . They had been assaulted before , quizzed , threatened . The spies and Temple agents were assigned to watch not only Jesus but anyone associated with him . It would be midafternoon or later before they reached the suburbs of Jerusalem . The streets would be swarming . Pray heaven they would not be recognized and waylaid , by either friends or enemies . If they were recognized , anythingcould happen . Their path had finally merged with the dusty highway . For the past hour they had been plodding up its last steep hill , along with other travelers . Most were on foot or riding donkeys ; some were mounted on camels , or leading the graceful , heavily laden beasts , whose bells chimed accompaniment to the rattle of hooves and wagon wheels , and the voices which were growing more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jerusalem . All were anxious to get where they were going , and paid no attention to them . Halfway to the summit was a crossroads , one road leading directly southwest to Bethany . Jesus had halted and was waiting for the others there . Before joining him , Judas insisted the men take counsel . " Something'swrong , " he said , scowling . " I can feel it  --  something 's going to happen . " He was biting a knuckle , shaking his head . " As you know , I 've caught up to Jesus several times today , but I could get nothing from him ; he simply told me to be patient . " Judas shrugged , in his half-charming , half-cynical way . " Maybe somebody else .. . You , Peter , you 're his favorite  --  why do n't you speak to him , find out what you can before we go further ? " Peter nodded . He , too , had been growing troubled . He did n't want to do this , but somebody had to . Telling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doggedly ahead . Jesus was sitting on a rock , chin in hand , gazing toward Jerusalem . Dimly in the distance , through the haze , a scattering of rooftops could be seen . Peter crouched beside him . " Master , we will soon reach the Mount of Olives , " he said bluntly . " Some of us are getting anxious . Please tell us what we may expect to find there . " Jesus started up out of his reverie , and gazed at him , nodding . The apostles must be told . They had waited long enough ; they must be prepared for what lay ahead . But the words of death were too brutal to hear just yet . How could he make the truth easier for them ? " Bring the men to me , " he said after a moment . " I will try to explain . " Peter trudged back , beckoning to the others to gather around him . Again they conferred earnestly for a few moments . And watching them , Jesus was touched . How dear they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much to follow him , risked everything  --  families , homes , friends ; even their livelihoods . Frightened ? Yes , often . And confused and upset , but no matter  --  in the end he could depend on them : They were obedient and loyal ; they were his children . Now , as the twelve came toward him , heads lifted , he saw the expectancy in their eyes , and sensed a renewal of their absolute and somehow innocentdedication . And for a moment he turned away , he could not face them.  |p196Andrew  spoke first , his long homely countenance solicitous . " Lord , are we in danger , that you look so concerned ? Or is it that you are troubled about Lazarus ? " Before Jesus could answer , Thomas broke in . " Please do n't be concerned for us , " he said fervently . " We have been discussing this among ourselves , and we are agreed  --  should any harm come to you , we are prepared to die for you ! " Jesus straightened and rose , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dear little flock , " he assured them , " we are in no danger . You , all of you whom I love , will reach the Mount of Olives with me safely . " " And Lazarus ? Then your heart is no longer troubled about our friend ? " Jesus drew a long , painful breath . He must tell them before they reached the village ; the whole place would be in mourning . But again the words seemed too cruel ; he would put them off as long as he could . " Lazarus has fallen asleep , " he said gently . " I feel he has slept enough . I am going to waken him . " He spoke out of compassion for them ; he had not anticipated their misunderstanding . " Then Lazarus is recovering ! " Peter exploded . In his joy he flung his arms around Jesus , and began shouting the good news for all to hear . " Jesus says Lazarus will be all right , he 's only sleeping ! " The others , too , were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their relief . " No , " Jesus interrupted sternly . The truth could be postponed no longer . " I was only trying to spare you . Now I must tell you plainly : Lazarus is dead . " The apostles gasped and stared at him , too shocked and disappointedto respond . Finally Peter spoke , and his voice was plaintive . " Master , why did you let this happen ? We thought ... when you did not heed the messenger . . . Why did you mislead us ? " he pleaded . " It was already too late , " Jesus told them . " Lazarus died before the messenger could reach us . And for your sakes I am glad I was not there . " He drew a hand across his stricken face . " Nonetheless , let us go to him . " Martha roused from her stupor and stared at the neighbor in disbelief . She was trembling . Four days of moaning and fasting hadp197left her weak . It was hard to hear above the fresh burst of wails and shrieking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the house still hummed with the voices of people here to console them . For days it had swarmed with friends coming and going , speaking in low tones , crouching beside the sisters , begging them to eat a little something , or drink a little wine . " Martha , did n't you hear me ? He 's on his way ! One of the mournersjust told me . That man Jesus  --  the famous rabbi ! " Martha jolted to awareness . A hot wave of life licked through her as she staggered to her feet . She could feel the plump motherly arms around her  --  a woman named Dinah , who was usually the first at a house of death , and the last to leave . Martha 's heart beat wildly ; never had she felt such blind exultation , heightened by the chill of her very outrage . She stared dazedly into the woman 's fat , kindly , excited face . " Where is he ? " she heard herself mumbling . " How do you know ? " " One of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back road , the one that bypasses the village . He must be coming here ! " Dumbly Martha pushed past her . She would go to him . She must see him first . What she would say to him she did n't know , only it must not be here in her brother 's house , among all these strangers  --  the confusion , the hideous noise , and the helpless , hopeless sound of Mary 's sobbing . Mary had been sobbing in that same soft , incessant way almost from the moment they had known Lazarus would not live .... Where did such tears come from ? Martha marveled abstractedly . She herself , to her dismay and embarrassment , could bring no moisture to her own dry , burning eyes . There was only this searing anguish in her breast and throat , this agony of burning . Martha went groping into her kitchen , once such a pride and place of comfort . Yet it meant nothing anymore ; how could she ever cook here again ? It was as a tomb , this place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Yet here she could dip water from a jar and bathe her lacerated face . Her hands shook ; she spilled the water and had n't the strength to wipe it up . She dropped the comb she was trying to drag through the matted hair straggling about her shoulders , its black now gray with the ashes she had dumped upon it . She brushed at it frantically , then glided swiftly into her chamber to pin it up . Jesus must not see her looking like this , but what more could she do ? She could not bear to look in the mirror.  |p198Even  so , she would go to him ; let her sister stay behind if she wanted . In her chamber , Mary still sobbed , huddled in a corner , while two friends crouched beside her . The three looked up astonished as Martha appeared , hurling her best cloak around her : a brightly colored one , covering her garment of sackcloth . " Jesus is coming , " she announced bitterly . " I 'm going forth to meet him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desolate . " Tell him not to hurry , " she choked , though without recrimination . " Tell him he is too late . " Martha plunged blindly down the hill , past the people who were still arriving  --  would they never stop coming ? All of Bethany had alreadycome to pay their respects to Lazarus , and half of Jerusalem , it seemed . Martha had no idea he 'd had so many friends . They looked at her in amazement in her bright-rose cloak , so incongruous with her mourning , saw the expression of dry , spent misery on her face , and made way for her . Poor Martha ; they recognized the symptoms of grief hysteria . She had always been a strange one , living only for her brother . But why was she leaving her guests ? A few paused to watch uneasily as she swerved and disappeared down the little-used road , wondering if they should follow . It was a beautiful day , Martha noticed absently ; spring seemed to have stolen over the hills during these last black days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glistened in the sun . There was a pink haze over the orchards ; the olive trees were greening . But how could there ever be life or spring for her again ? And it need n't have been taken from her . Her teeth were bared , her fists clenched . She was still weak and giddy from fasting and the few swallows of wine well-meaning visitors had forced upon her . Her head raced with all the things she would say . But when she finally saw Jesus approaching alone under the trees  --  for he had told the others to wait behind a little way  --  the words vanished . Martha halted , trembling . She no longer felt the love-rage burning , only this cold white emptiness . She could not speak at first , she could only stare at him bleakly . " You could have saved him , " she said at last , in a voice of dry despondency . " If you had stayed with us a little longer . . . if you had even come when we sent for you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not have died ! " She flung a hand over her grimacing mouth . And at last , in a releasing flood , the hot tears fell . " He was all we had ! " " I know , I know . " Jesus reached out his arms to her and enfolded her , like a child . He drew her down beside him on a rough oak log that lay beside the path , and held her against him , patting her shoulders , which were shaking so violently in their bright wrap . He stroked her silvering hair , where some of the ashes still clung . " I loved him too , " he told her , the muscles in his throat working . " Do you think I would have let any harm come to him had it been within my power to prevent it ? " " But God himself has given you special powers , " she cried fiercely . " You are a prophet , a healer , some people say the Messiah . Even now , " she pleaded , as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that even now God would give you whatever you ask ! " In her desperationshe had pulled away from him and was searching his face . " Do n't grieve , Martha , " Jesus said . " Please do n't grieve . I promise you that your brother will rise again . " " Yes , yes , I know that , " she moaned . " I know that he will rise again at the last day , in the resurrection . But now . . . what of now ? " Yes , now . What of now ? . . . Jesus stared past her into the distance , sorrowing as he remembered : His grandfather Joachim lying on the threshing floor . His father , Joseph , crushed . And John , poor John ... Father , dear Father , what of now ? At last Jesus turned to Martha , and cupping her face in his hands , looked deep into her eyes . " 1 am the resurrection and the life , " he stated gravely . " Anyone who believes in me shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Martha bit her dry cracked lips . " Yes , Lord , " she cried softly . " I believe you are the Christ , the one sent to save the world . " It was a joy to confess this , as it had been a relief and joy to confess her love . " You are the Son of God ! " " Go , then , and tell Mary . Go as quickly as you can and bring Mary back to me . " Heads turned as Martha rushed into the house . A little huddle of men broke up , relieved . People had been worring about her , trying not to let Mary know . Martha had not looked well , and it was growingp200late . Soon they would have to return to their homes , but how could they leave Mary without being sure her sister was safe ? " Praise heaven ! " exclaimed Absalom , a rugged , gentle bull of a man who had served Lazarus for years . " We were about to send a party out to search for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speak to Mary . " In her gracious but determinedmanner , Martha pushed past them into her sister 's chamber , her face white and fixed . Martha knelt beside the still-weeping figure , and with an effort , Mary stopped crying . She was exhausted , drowned in her own tears . She pressed a fist fiercely against her lips , lifted her swollen face . " What is it ? " " The teacher is here ! " Martha whispered . " I have seen him ; he is asking for you . " Mary got quickly to her feet , wiping her eyes . " Where is he ? Take me to him . " To the surprise of everyone , the sisters reappeared together . Speaking to no one , only clinging to each other , they left the house  --  Mary still bowed with grief , Martha supporting her . And watching them , the heart of Absalom broke afresh . He had known the family since their childhood , taught Lazarus his trade , and prayed that such fine girls would find good husbands . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bier and helped carry her to the cave ; the little daughter too , when she was five . And now his shoulders still ached with the weight of this final burden . Absalom was himself bereft , and he was torn at sight of the sisters . " Each day they go to the tomb to weep , " he muttered . " Later they will have to manage , but today they should not make this sad journey alone . Let us follow .... " Jesus stood waiting for the women . His apostles had arrived , feeling they had lingered long enough at the bottom of the hill , as he had bade them . Now they meandered uncertainly about this small clearing beside the path . Faintly from the hilltop they could hear the sounds of mourning , the musicians ' dirge , the echoes of wailing . They were uneasy , awkward before the situation , filled with dread , but troubled by this further delay . Why did n't Jesus take them at once to be with Mary and Martha , and comfortp201them as best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from them , one foot planted on a rock , his white garments blowing in the soft wind that had risen . He was gazing in the direction of Jerusalem once more , his hands locked together , his face grim . What he was thinking they did n't know , nor what he was confronting . They only knew that he was suffering . At last they saw the sisters coming down the path , trailed by a number of others . It was hard to recognize Mary and Martha without their brother  --  the three had always seemed as one ; hard to believe these were the same charming women who had so often made them welcome  --  these two with their faces cruelly lacerated , their eyes red and swollen . And seeing them too , Jesus straightened , and went to meet them . With a glad little cry , Mary broke free from Martha and came running toward him , hands outstretched . " Lord , dearest Lord ! " she wept , as she fell at his feet and kissed them . " If only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have died . " And her words unmanned him . For though they were the same words Martha had uttered , there was in them no rebuke . Jesus could conceal his own agony no longer . His eyes filled as he drew Mary to her feet . He looked about at those who had followed  --  all these people , all this grief ! They , too , loved Lazarus ; or they had loved others that were torn from their arms , and in comforting Mary and Martha the memory of their own grief overwhelmed them . So that all mankind was one in this endless torture of loving and parting , and it must be comforted . It must be shown that death can be overcome . His spirit groaned ; he was deeply troubled . And looking about at those who had followed , he asked , " Where have you laid him ? " Absalom stepped forward , the family friend . " Come and see . " And covering his face with his hands as they walked to the tomb , Jesus wept . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind a thicket of trees . A tangle of vines spilled over its entrance , though some of them had been torn back to make way for the huge gray disk that blocked its entrance . Each day someone swept the rocky earth before it , but dry leaves and twigs still drifted about . Sparrows dipped and twittered among the trees . The people had fallen silent . In the stillness theyp202could hear the little birds , the rustling branches , and a sound of small animal feet scurrying somewhere . The enormous granite rock glittered in the light that was filtering through the leaves . Jesus lifted his eyes and his arms to heaven , and groaning again in his spirit , he prayed . Then , turning to the big man Absalom and his apostle Peter , who stood closest , he ordered , " Roll away the stone ! " Martha gasped and clutched his arm . Her face had gone white with horror as well as hope . " Lord , by this time my brother 's body will be decaying , " she whispered . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been dead four days . " Jesus looked at her steadily . " Did n't I say to you that if you believed , you would see the glory of God ? " He turned again to the men . Though they had stepped forward , they hesitated , hearts pounding , regarding the great stone . It was a heavy granite wheel , of the kind used for pressing olives . Once more Jesus ordered sternly , " Take away the stone ! " Breathing hard , the men put their shoulders to the wheel , pushing , pushing , feeling its stubborn weight against their bodies , and the grit of it against their sweating palms . When it did not budge , Andrew and Philip leapt forward to help , and little by little the stone began to move , and finally to roll . A bat whipped out of the cold dark opening ; they could hear the chirping of swallows that nested inside this place of death , and the sound of water dripping . And raising his arms and his eyes once more to heaven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have heard me . Forgive me for my purely human fears , for I know that you always hear me , as you will hear me now . All that I have said and done is because of these people , that they may witness your power over death itself , and so believe it is you who sent me . " He strode forth then to the very door of the cave and looked in , stooping , for it was low , bracing himself against the sides . He stood for a long moment , gazing at the shelf where the body of Lazarus lay . Behind him he could feel the shocked and frightened people watching , feel their doubts , their hopes , their awed and terrible anticipation . And summoning all his power , Jesus felt his own body shuddering as he called out in a loud voice : " Lazarus , come forth ! " The words echoed in the chill rock walls of the cave . . . . Thep203people could hear them . . . . Could Lazarus hear them ? . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Waken Lazarus , let him rise up as I have promised , that they may believe . And with a thrill of joy Jesus felt his power rush from him again , pouring through the body of his friend ; he felt the stilled heart stirring . With a sob , Jesus went to him , crouching because the ceiling was so low ; and ripping aside the linen strips , he took the hand of Lazarus , that Lazarus might feel his warmth through the binding of his grave clothes . " You are awake now , Lazarus , " he said gently . " Do n't be afraid , I am here beside you . Come with me . " Then , leading his friend by the hand , and stepping out of the doorway before him , Jesus brought him forth , that the people might see him . Still wrapped in his burial windings but whole , and about him no odor or evidence of decay . Weeping and smiling , Jesus embraced him , and pulled the napkin from his bewildered face . Jesus kissed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who stood frozen , eyes wide , fists pressing back their own cries of wonder and joy , not yet quite daring to believe . " Behold . Your brother , who was dead , lives again ! Unbind him and let him go . "  |p204OW  tell me again , " said the high priest , leaning forward on the ilded chair , and shifting his weight to ease the burning in his rectum . " What is this preposterous thing ? " A cushion would help , but Caiaphas did n't want to make himself look foolish by groping around for one . He was a man of small stature , and very defensive about it : an abrupt , sour-mouthed little man , who felt secretly inadequate for his high office , and suspicious that others looked down on him for the way he had acquired it  --  from his fatherin-law , the powerful , conniving Annas . Part of Caiaphas shrank in self-contempt , another part drank in the honor with a fierce delight : the wealth , the pomp and ceremony . Yes , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for was not the high priest considered the living incarnation of the sacred Law ? But oh , the problems . His head ached after another restless , fretful night . The hot pitchforks in his rear never ceased their tormenting . Such scant sleep as had finally come was peopled with demons . And when he rose he felt bilious  --  probably all that wine he had drunk in his desperation for some relief . His own wry sense of humor did not ignore the irony : that he , head of the priestly class , bound by the rules of ritual cleanliness , anointed with the holy oil , as once the kings had been , should suffer these embarrassing afflictions of the flesh . Nonetheless , it was all he could do to perform the opening ceremonies at the Temple . He had hastened to his couch in his richly appointed quarters off the council chamber , hoping for a little rest . . . . And now this ! " Come , come , " he snapped , " do n't stand there gawking at me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The man 's name was Gideon ; he wasp205a very tall , kindly but imposing doctor of the Law , a member of the Sanhedrin for years . Caiaphas had always felt inferior to him . " I 'm sorry to bring you this message , but I feel I must . Though you 'll hear about it soon enough , I 'm afraid . " Gideon hesitated . " It 's about that man Jesus , " he said , as the high priest groaned . " He has just raised a man from the dead . " " Oh , no ! " Caiaphas groaned again , and made a gesture of contempt and dismissal . " Not another one . Why bother me with these tales ? These rumors  --  people will believe anything ! " " But the others , those we have heard of , were off somewhere in the provinces , " Gideon reminded him soberly , " Capernaum , Nain . This is nearby , right here , not even a Sabbath day 's journey  --  " Caiaphas gave a little start , visibly upset @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town is feasting and celebrating , for they know the man well . He is there now among them , joining the celebration . Yet some of the people tell me they helped place him in the tomb ! Four days he was in the crypt , they claim . " Caiaphas covered his mouth , fearing he might be violently sick . " I do n't believe it . People go mad , no matter where they live . " He sat , small , spare and rigid , scowling at the man , struggling for control . " How do you know this ? " he demanded . " I have just come from Bethany , " Gideon acknowledged uneasily . Something about him made the priest grip the arms of his chair . " I saw Lazarus myself . He was there , alive and well , walking about ! " " Lazarus ! " Caiaphas choked . " Are you trying to tell me this was Lazarus ? " He sat stupefied for a second . " The fool , the fool , " he muttered , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men in the city  --  or so we thought . A fine man , good Sadducee , " he sneered , " until he was taken in by that charlatan ! Tell me , " the priest asked angrily , " do you know what really happened ? Did you witness this so-called miracle ? " " No . Not exactly . I had done business with Lazarus ; his groves furnished most of the olives for my press . Other transactions . I knew him , knew the family . I was simply going to his home to pay my respects . But when I reached the house I found it empty . The mournershad all gone to the burial cave . Then I heard them returning . " He swallowed . " But to my astonishment , they were not weeping , but laughing and singing , rejoicing and praising God , for Lazarus was there among them ! "  |p206Gideon  had maintained his dignity throughout . Now he began to pale , and his voice trembled . He felt suddenly faint . His eyes roved questioningly to another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he might sit down . " Sir , I saw him , " he said , " still in his burial wrappings . His hands and his feet had been freed from their bindings , and the napkin taken from his face , but as he came toward us , walking between his two sisters , there was no doubt  --  at least not then  --  that he had indeed been in the grave . " Caiaphas had sprung up and was stalking about , beating his small jeweled fists together . He , too , felt faint . " Did he stink ? " he heard himself asking crudely . " No . There were no signs of decay . He seemed a little dazed , he looked astonished , but there were no signs of decay . " " A trick ! " the priest spat , outraged . " Obviously a trick . Or Lazarusis demon-possessed . He 's become one of that fraud 's chief supporters . Entertains Jesus in his home , he and his sisters  --  even that band of rabble that travel with him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Jesus ; give them money  --  anything . It 's a trick . " " Yes , perhaps , " Gideon said doubtfully , and wiped his brow . " But the Jews do n't think so . The story is spreading , people are excited , even many who were n't sure before , or were actually against him . Jesus will be more popular than ever , I 'm afraid . " " And you ? " The priest 's sarcastic eyes narrowed , bored into him . " What do you think ? " Gideon pondered , detesting the man but reluctant to offend him . The whole thing seemed more incredible by the minute . He was forced to remember : There had been a few skeptics even among the jubilant crowd ; he had heard their private whisperings : jealousy , envy , doubt , or a desire to curry favor ? Whatever , he knew there were some who would rush to report this to the authorities . " I do n't , know , " he said honestly . " I only know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel it my duty to prepare you before you hear it from someone else . There 's no telling what may happen . " Caiaphas wheeled suddenly , pointing a finger . " Let me tell you what is going to happen , " he exploded , " the next time that pretender shows his face in Jerusalem ! We 're going to put him away for good . There 'll be no more preaching at the Temple , no more chicanery ofp207healings , no more disturbances during the festivals . Even John the Baptist never caused us such trouble as this ! " Breathing hard , careful of the emerods , Caiaphas eased himself back into the chair . A few cushionshad spilled from his couch onto the floor . In desperation he grabbed one and stuffed it under his bottom , never mind how he looked . " We 've been too lenient . It 's a disgrace the soldiers have n't arrested him and dragged him in before ! They 've disobeyed orders ; they 'll be severely punished , along with the impostor . " He paused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pillow , regaining his composure . His receding chin lifted ; he sat drumming the arm of his chair , planning . He spoke crisply now . " I 'll call a meeting of the council for tomorrow . Get word to Nicodemus , " he ordered , " Simon of Cyrene , Joseph of Arimathea , any others you can . I 'll send out messengers , of course , and take care of informing the priests serving here . Oh , yes , and have signal fires lit so nobody will have an excuse that he did n't know . We must have a good turnout  --  this thing has gone far enough ! " It was a relief finally to take action . He was suddenly grateful to Gideon for bringing him this awful news , and said so , curtly . Though he seldom rose in the presence of taller men , and when he did never looked up , Caiaphas not only got to his feet , he embraced his visitor and kissed him . Then , turning his back abruptly , he began summoning servants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to carry him home . It was getting late , he was exhausted , and the itching and burningwere almost intolerable . It was all he could do to keep from clawing himself . . . . He could hardly wait to get home to his wife and her cooling salve . Caiaphas felt better about himself as the litter bearers carried him toward his palace . He sank back , sighing , buoyed up by his performance , and cheered by the prospect of the almost certain triumph to come . It also pleased him to know that eyes lifted in awed fascinationas the conveyance passed along the busy streets . Shopkeepers halted as they took down their awnings and gathered up their wares to bring inside ; mothers with children held them up to watch . Recog- nixing from the liveried guards , the curtains with their golden fringe , the proud insignia set with rubies , that the most important person in Israel was passing  --  the very high priest !  |p208Like  an ark it bore him , a precious vessel , sacred and unseen . Sometimes Caiaphas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people , as an emperor would . Or as Annas often had , for his father-in-law was a vain old peacock who 'd behaved as he pleased : grown fat on the priesthood , sucking the treasuries dry during the seven years he had reigned , then clinging to the post like a leech for himself and his five sons . Yet even after he was deposed by Tiberius for his treacheries , Annas ' power over the people had not waned . They still loved him and acclaimed him , trusted him to make decisions for them as he had so long . Caiaphas could not help a grudging admiration for the sly old villain , who socialized boldly with the Romans , entertained them royally , and worked hand in glove with them to keep the peace . Which meant mainly preserving the good life for the upper classes while appeasing the common herd . For instance , there was the way he 'd handled the uproar when the new prefect Pilate insulted Israel by displaying the Roman eagle , images of Caesar and other emblems on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Temple , that after a showy public confrontation , which included leading an outraged delegationall the way to Caesarea to protest , Annas quietly bribed Pilate to take them down . ( The prefect bought his first big estate in Sicily shortly thereafter , and built a handsome villa on the shores of Pompeii for his wife . ) Well , the old scoundrel could afford it , and his cunning only won him more adulation from his stupid worshipers . Caiaphas stiffened with disdain . He refused to look out . His dignityas well as his common sense forbade it . Why risk the resentment , even contempt , he might see on those faces ? ( Now stop this ! Jews revered the office he represented . Why did he always imagine rejection ? ) No , better to remain hidden ; the last thing , he needed was for them to catch their sanctified high priest grimacing with pain from the jolting and bumping . These idiots on whose shoulders he perched ! Crossing the bridge that led to the upper city , they nearly dropped him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wildly . He could have been killed ! Caiaphas clutched the straps in terror . And why were they taking the long , steep route that led up so many steps , tipping him back even further on his tortured bottom ? Worse , leading him through the massive bronze gates ( he could hear them clanking as they opened )  |p209and  across the vast courtyards of his father-in-law 's palace ! Though the word was a misnomer , for the complex of severe but shining marblebuildings housed not only the priestly family but bodyguards , servants , officers and clerks  --  a domain that rivaled Herod 's . Caiaphas boiled with humiliation . Was there some conspiracy to parade him past like the helpless captive they would always consider him ? Here , though hunching back to hide himself , Caiaphas could not resist parting the swaying curtains slightly and peering out . A gush of moist , sweet air filled his nostrils . There was the musical lilt and splashing of many fountains , sparkling in the light that rained down from the lamps in hundreds of windows , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lay full and glistening . Early roses were already a mass of pink , giving off their perfume , other flowers beginning to bloom . Years ago Annas had arranged to have water piped directly from the Temple to his gardens ; and while he was at it , the blood from the sacrifices was piped in too , to fertilize the soil . The result was a flourishing paradise , not only of native plants and flowers , but of rare oriental shrubs and trees  --  gardens to surpass any in Jerusalem . Yes , the old man had done all right for himself . Again that rush of grudging admiration , half envy , half dismay . And the wily old schemer did n't think he was finished yet . After years of ruling the country himself , then through his sons , he planned to keep right on through his daughter 's husband . . . . Caiaphas bridled , remembering the night he had been summoned to the house they were passing now  --  the biggest one , with the Corinthian columns  --  and informed that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Temple , would henceforth conduct himself with special care , for there were certain matters pending that could very well result in his being appointed high priest ! Caiaphas had been staggered , almost overcome . The sheer effronteryof the man , his skill at manipulation ! Although he should n't have been surprised ; his wife had been hinting at this for years . Each of her brothers had loathed the job , and eventually wanted out . All of them had been educated in Alexandria or Rome , where they were athletes who participated in the games and became friends of the gladiators . All were pagans at heart . Even here in Jerusalem they openly attended the Circus Maximus and the theaters . The complicated rituals of the Temple bored them , and they sickened of the bloody mess of prepar/ing and offering animals for sacrifice . There were offices almost as lucrative and a lot less taxing , which were the exclusive property of the high priest , to be distributed among his family . Each son finally persuaded him : The eldest was now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the breeding and selling of the ritually perfect doves , which every woman must sacrifice for her purification after giving birth to a child . Others raked in rents and generous profits from the money changers , the stock dealers and the merchants who sold a vast array of goods to the worshipers . Theirs , too , the business of providing everything needed for simply running the enormous complex of the Temple : the curtains and linens and priestly vestments , the incense and herbs and oil used for the ceremonies , the food , the furnishings , the wine  --  every item considered holy , since it must first pass through the sacred hands of the high priest or his clan . Eventually running out of sons , Annas had nobody left but a sonin-lawto keep this vast source of wealth in the family , let alone the high honor . But that was all right with the old man . Maybe even better . Caiaphas could picture him rubbing his big hands in anticipation . Annaswas an ebullient , hawk-nosed , curly-bearded lion of a man , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looks , personality , self-assurance . This one , Annas was undoubtedly sneering , would be easy to manage . Resentful , cowering inside , Caiaphas had accepted the offer when it came . His wife , Priscilla , had persuaded him . " You can do it . You must . He ca n't live forever , and remember  --  we , too , have sons to think of . " She was right . Caiaphas adapted quickly to life in his own palace  --  whichwas only a little less splendid than this one  --  in the pomp and prestige of the Temple . It amused him sometimes to see how people deferred to him , bowed down before him when he appeared before them in the grandeur of his huge jeweled turban , the gems on his breastplate flashing . He enjoyed donning that heavy and rather ridiculous headpiece which made him look so much taller , and struttingabout in his costume of scarlet and blue , decorated with pomegranates , his waist girded with a sash of spun gold , the bells on his broad , winglike sleeves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( he had never been challenged before ) , he promptly mastered the intricate ceremonies , which he executed withp211a grace , skill and vague disdain which surpassed the art of even his predecessors . The shadow of Annas still hung over him ; Caiaphas. knew he was being watched , influenced , maneuvered ; yet within him ( almost from the time he first donned that turban ) was born a stubborn determination not only to outlive his father-in-law but to cling to this office even more tenaciously than he had . Meanwhile , he would somehow prove to Annas  --  yes , to all Israel  --  thathe was worthy of such attention , he , too , had the power and authority to lead them . Well , now the opportunity was at hand . He regretted he had n't asserted himself sooner in the matter of Jesus . Three years now of fret and worry . Caiaphas realized he had seemed inept , his attempts to put a stop to the nuisance mere scoldings and hand wringings . His own soldiers , probably sensing his vacillation , would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they only came slinkingback , saying he was doing no harm . A few , Caiaphas learned to his shock and embarrassment , had actually been mesmerized by the impostor , believing him to be the long-promised king and deliverer ! But no , wait now  --  do n't blame yourself . Caiaphas gritted his teeth , threshed about miserably in his curtained cage . Most of this frustrating delay was the old man 's fault . Pooh-poohing the threat , advising patience , caution . Time and again they 'd discussed it  --  althoughyou did n't discuss anything with Annas , you listened to his lengthy , often eloquent , rambling discourses and pronouncements . Stretched like a beautifully groomed , amiable lion on his golden couch , he would roar a welcome  --  half rising to clap you on the shoulder , at the same time shoving you down into a chair while he paid you a false compliment  --  and proceed to belittle the issue . The last time was not much better than the others : " Now , now , calm down , we 're doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observed , investigated . So far he poses no threat , not compared to some of the self-appointed messiahs I 've dealt with . So he comes from Galilee , which seems to breed the Zealots , and yes , sometimesone of them has to be stopped , put to death if he gets out of hand . But only as a last resort . When you 've been around as long as I have , you 'll realize the best thing to do with most of them is to ignore them . Get worked up about every crazy prophet and messiah that comes along and you wo n't have time for your own wife , let alone the Temple ! "  | " But this one  --  " " Yes , this one  --  from what I hear , he 's different , preaches peace , turning the other cheek , forgiving the enemy . Not a bad idea , really . Let the people listen , it wo n't hurt them ; they have to believe in something , do n't they ? They love that dream  --  that old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worst thing you can do is take it away from them ; attack the one who 's promising them the sky and you 're in trouble . No , no , do n't touch their current messiah ; you just make him more of a hero . Leave him alone and they get tired of him , or disgusted with him and turn on him themselves . Did n't I hear that some of the people tried to stone this Jesus the last time he came for a festival ? Too bad they did n't succeed , but that 's not up to us . In time , if there 's evidence he 's really blaspheming , saying things that could disturb the faith , threaten to overthrow the system , get Rome on our backs  --  " " He claims to be the Messiah of God , " Caiaphas managed to break in , tightly . " They all do ; he 's just crazy like the rest of them . Now if  --  " " He also attacks the scribes and Pharisees , " Caiaphas persisted . " Good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well , most of them , pretending to be so righteous while they steal you blind . Actuallybelieving in a God that personally looks after them and when they die will usher them into heaven ! No common sense , none of them , not like us Sadducees  --  we know better . Now if  --  " " He 's said he will tear down the Temple ! " Caiaphas almost yelped in his frustration . Annas reared up slightly , pursing his moist pink lips . For a time he lay contemplating , playing with his carefully brushed and oiled double-pointed beard . " Mad , utterly mad , " he muttered , nodding . Then wearily he sat up , stretched , yawned audibly and got to his feet , signaling with a sly grin that the interview was at an end . " Trust me , I 'll look into this further . Meanwhile , do n't be so serious . You 're workingtoo hard , you look a little peaked . " To Caiaphas ' outrage , the old man stooped slightly , so that the hated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my daughter to give you a potion . You 're nervous as a cat , you 're actually shaking . " A big hand grabbed Caiaphas ' shoulder , steered him amiably but firmly to the door . There , to his own astonishment , Caiaphas halted ,  |p213stared  at Annas a second , and heard himself asking an incredible question : " You do n't believe in the Messiah ? " " What ? " The old man stood open-mouthed . " Which messiah ? ' This one ? " " The Messiah . The prophecies , the . . . predictions , " Caiaphas quavered . He was indeed shaking now . " You know  --  the Anointed One . You spoke of it as a myth to give people something to look forward to  --  " Annas threw back his bushy head and roared with laughter . " My dear son , " he condescended , " every so-called prophecy is a sentence or two plucked from the psalms or uttered a long time ago by a man who frothed at the mouth . Strung together , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on to through every imprisonment and persecution . That someday we 'll have our own king , a magical personagesent down from heaven to free us from whatever ruler we happen to be under  --  right now it 's the Romans  --  solve all our problems , make us not only free but probably happy and rich . " " This rabbi Jesus is telling the poor that very thing right now : The kingdom of heaven is at hand . He 's telling the rich to sell what they have and give it to them , the poor  --  " " Ridiculous , outrageous  --  the very idea ! " " And you do n't believe any of it , " Caiaphas repeated . For some reason , it was important to him to be sure . " It 's all a lie , or just a story . There will never be a deliverer , a true Messiah . " " Now wait , do n't put words in my mouth . I said no such thing . In time , yes , it 's possible , sometime in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , not here in Jerusalem , that 's sure . Why , it would change everything , turn things upside down . Give our money to the poor and let them run things ? A fine mess we 'd be in ! Drive out the Romans ? Most of us have never been better off . Old Herod built our Temple for us , bless his black murdering soul . Look at it  --  even Rome itself does n't have a building so magnificent . And so long as the Herodsand their Roman friends stay out of it , we have no quarrel . No , we 've prospered under the Romans ; barring a few massacres when hotheads drove them too far , they 've treated us well . I 'm not saying the real Messiah wo n't come sometime , if things get worse . But the worst thing that could happen , at least for us , would be for him to appear right now . "  | " Forgive me , Sir , but if  --  if it were possible that this man is  --  could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It is not only impossible , we could not have it ! Possible or impossible , we can not have it . Whoever he is , he must be  --  " Annas caught himself . " If there is any likelihood at all , if there is the slightest possibility  --  well , you 're right , he will have to be stopped . " " Then you agree  --  the man is a threat . " Annas had thrown up his hands , sick of the whole business . " You 've badgered me into it . Have it your own way . But be careful , do n't be in any hurry , leave any final decisions to me . " Caiaphas braced himself , remembering . At least the old man had caved in . But there would be no more waffling or waiting for approval . This business about Lazarus had to be dealt with right now . True or untrue , it was his crisis , a chance to prove what he could do . Unfortunately , they could n't capture the disturberimmediately  --  no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miss the Passover . And maybe a good thing , impatient as Caiaphas was for action . What better time to demonstrate his own authority than to strike when all eyes would be on him ? Caiaphas slept better that night ; his wife had prepared both a soothing salve and a sleeping potion . And when he strutted into the Hall of Hewn Stones the next day , it cheered him to see that despite the late notice , the place was swarming , the huge vaulted chamber echoing to the sounds of many voices . Both parties were generously represented , not only Sadducees and Pharisees , but many priests and scribes and elders . Almost the entire seventy-one members were there already . For the astounding news about Lazarus had indeed reached them . And though all of them were incredulous , and some of them uncertain , most of them were deeply concerned , if not alarmed . They were debating it among themselves even before Caiaphas arrived to mount the marble steps in his robes of office , and reign above them from his gilded throne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hearing them out before he rose to address them . What were they going to do about this Jesus ? Out in the provinces , though many had fallen away , others were still following by the thousands  --  through Galilee and beyond , north , south , east and west , Capernaum , Tyre and Sidon , Caesarea Philippi ,  |p215and  all along the Jordan . That was bad enough , but to have this threat rising up right here on their very doorstep , deep into Judea , the very Temple ! Three years it had been coming on . They 'd been warned  --  why had n't they faced it before ? And now , right here in Jerusalem  --  if he was n't stopped , many more would believe his claims . To have a well-known man like Lazarus openly walking these streets after being in the tomb four days ! True or false , people are so eager to believe . What can we do about a prophet people think can raise the dead ? Kill him ? . . . Wait now , let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a devout Jew , a rabbi preaching regularly in the synagogues as well as in the fields , worshiping at the Temple , seeming to know every letter of the Law . Impossible to trap him ; some of us have tried . He only turns the questionsback on us . Yet he scoffs at many of the laws , eats forbidden food , does n't always wash before meals , heals on the Sabbath ... . Heals . That was the word that aroused and excited them most . Shouting and waving their arms , the members of the council clamored to be heard . What are we gong to do about Jesus ? He 's giving the people miracles . And the people want miracles , no matter what else he says and does . " Heal my leprosy , make my blind child see , feed my family ! " ( Why not , if he really fed the multitudes ? ) " Bring back my father , my wife , open all the graves , raise the dead ! " Where will all this lead ? If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the whole nation could soon believe in him . The people will want to crown him king ! Do you think the Romans would stand by and let this happen ? What about Caesar , Herod , Pilate , Tiberius ? They 'd make short work of us . We would n't be a nation anymore ! What are we going to do about Jesus ? Who attacks everything this body stands for . Calls us hypocrites , liars , whited sepulchres , thieves  --  worse things than even John the Baptist did . Who 's insulted this sacred Temple , claiming it 's too filthy to survive , he himself will tear it down . You priests , do you want the altars empty , the fires to go out ? No more animals to be brought for the sacrifice  --  and your food ? No more meat to be carried home ? What are we going to do about Jesus ? We 'd better think now , all of us . Our very livelihoods could be at stake . How many of us deal with the Temple ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the offerings , invest its funds in properties , are merchants for all the goodsp216it uses  --  getting a fair price , let 's remember , thanks to our revered high priest and his sons . Scarcely a one of us here but would be affected . Why , the economy of the whole country could be overturned ! What if there were no more tithes pouring in from the farmers , a tenth of everything they raised or earned ? No more tithes and offerings even from the laborers and fishermen ? Even those peasants out in the provinceswould be affected . No telling what this man has promised them , along with the kingdom of heaven . A kingdom he 's claimed can be theirs right here on earth ! No wonder they 're following this Nazarene ! Half the day the impassioned arguments continued . Most of the time Caiaphas merely sat listening , although stamping the floor with his gem-studded scepter now and then so that some speaker might be heard . He also squirmed and shifted wretchedly , for the salve 's effect had worn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt as if he were being stung by a swarm of bees . And a wild thought struck him , an idea so incongruous Caiaphas managed a wry grin . This miracle worker they were debating evidently healed far more serious afflictions ; maybe if he arranged to see Jesus privately ... ! Caiaphas finally lifted his jeweled hand . Feeling majestic , even tall , in his turban , he scowled them to silence . " Enough ! The will of this body seems obvious . You consider Jesus of Nazareth a threat to the people of Israel . It is therefore decreed that he be brought to trial before he can do further harm . " " But what is his crime ? " Nicodemus shouted . He had been trying to ask the question for hours . Now he strode determinedly forward to confront the high priest himself . " Is healing a crime ? Is raising a man from the dead ? Lazarus is my friend . If bringing such a man back to life is a crime , then let it be , for the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arimathea had also lumbered to his feet . " True ! " he thundered in his thick breathy voice . " Jesus is a holy man . We condemnhim at our peril . " " He is a blasphemer , " Caiaphas yelled . " Making people believe he is the Christ , inciting the poor to riot . " Furiously he stamped the floor again . " You know nothing at all , " he sneered . " Either of you . You 're both fools for defending him so long , and any who agree with you are fools . Innocent of these charges or not , he must be put to death . Is n't it better that one man should die than that all the nationp217perish ? If Jesus cares so much for the people , let him give his life for the people ! " Caiaphas could bear no more . In his anger he threw his scepter down and stalked from the chamber . He did not realize , departing , that his words , like those of the prophets , would echo down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawing nearer . The weight of his own cross had been constant on his shoulders for months , its shadow hovering , growing darker , dogging his every step . And no matter what direction he took , all roads led back to that inevitable hill . It was not to escape this that he had fled with his apostles after the raising of Lazarus , but only to avoid the frenzied excitement of the crowds . " Go quickly , " Lazarus himself had urged that very night , white and shaken as he was . " Once word of this spreads you will be besieged , you will have no peace . " Jesus nodded . He had already chosen Ephraim , a forested area in the mountains , with a few scattered stone houses . They would rest there and pray . And he must prepare his men ; there was still so much they did n't understand . " Tell no one . " He held his friend almost fiercely in a brief farewell . " We will be back a few days before the Passover . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joined in the celebration . " No , no , we must leave , " he warned . " Hurry , do n't linger , even to say goodbye . " Once again he must deal the blow he dreaded . Again he must face their shock and disappointment . " Why , Master , why ? " He did n't blame them . His heart ached for them . To have arrived here so weary , worried and confused  --  until the relief and jubilation of what happened at the tomb ! Now was the time to rejoice with the others . People were swarming around them , embracing them , bombarding them with questions ; the food and wine would soon be served . They had earned the right to stay , not to flee back into the night like thieves.  | " It 's for your own safety , " he had to tell them . " Scatter , hide your faces lest we be recognized and questioned . Take the back roads to Ephraim . We will meet there tomorrow . " The place was so small and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Here the exhausted apostles slept , or sat trying to listen to what Jesus was teaching . But their minds were still preoccupied with the miracle of Lazarus , jubilant over his return , confident now of coming triumphs . The Passover was coming ; surely some wonderful thing would happen . In spite of  --  even because of  --  what Jesus had done ! Those who had wives would send word by special messenger : Come , come join us ! They had been away from home a long time . Jesus , too , wrote a letter , one night of terrible loneliness , long after the others slept . Concern for his mother was an agony almost equal to the specter of the cross . Spare her , keep her safe , do n't let her have to suffer this with me . Yet he knew she would come , she must come ; that , too , was written ... . And the apostles . There was no way , of course , to spare them . He had already tried to warn them , attempted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not ready . It seemed heartless to trouble them just yet . Let them rejoice a little longer . Soon , very soon , he would make it clear . On the way back to Jerusalem , he would make sure they understood . It would happen at Passover . And they must be strong . They had been chosen for this because they were strong , tough men , used to hardships , and loyal . They must be brave enough to face the ordeal . And they would have to carry on . Lazarus returned from his first day in Jerusalem with the news . " Oh , Lazarus , what is it ? " Martha cried , seeing his ashen face as he walked in . " Are you ill ? " A horrible fear smote her . He looked almost as he had on the night they had lost him . And it flashed through her mind that the excitement of the past few days had been too much for him . People coming day and night . Begging to see him , visiting the tomb , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he ventured out . Touching him  --  Lazarus , who had always been such a private person . People mad with curiosity , asking for the story over and over . Jesus , this remarkable Jesus , when was he returning ? Whenp220could they see him too ? Would he stay with them during the Passover , would he be speaking at the Temple ? And now . . . Lazarus ' sisters had begged him not to go back to his office in the city ; they had worried all day . That could be even worse for him , and they could not stand it . None of them could endure again what they had just been through . Mary , too , rushed in , guided her brother to a chair and quickly poured him a glass of wine . Lazarus downed it and sat for a moment composing himself . " You were right , " he acknowledged crisply , when he could speak . " It was foolish for me to go back so soon . What happened to me is the talk of the city . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then you must never go back . Stay here with us ! " " No , no , do n't worry about me , " Lazarus interrupted impatiently . " That 's not the reason I 'm so shaken . It 's ... Jesus . " Lazarus plunged his face into his hands for a moment . When he looked up , his alert black eyes were stricken . " My sisters , we must realize  --  this marvelous thing he has done for us has not helped his cause . It has only made things worse for him . " They were staring at him , incredulous . " But it proves that he is all he claims , " Mary protested . " This miracle . You are living proof ! Witnesses can attest to it ; I 've heard followers are already multiplying because of it . " " And he is the Messiah , " Martha cried , in soft , indignant wonder . " The authorities would be fools not to recognize that now . The people believe it , the people will demand it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not persecute him further  --  not the Messiah ! " Lazarus smiled cynically . " That 's exactly what they 're afraid of . Not just any messiah  --  the Messiah . It 's the last thing they want , " he tried to explain . Politically and financially it would spell ruin . Lazarus went on to relate all he had heard . " This time the high priest means business . Jesus is in real danger if he returns for the Passover . " " But he would never miss the Passover ! " " Pray God he will this time , " Lazarus said . " Pray heaven he 'll stay on in Ephraim until this blows over . Or go back to Galilee  --  anywhere but Jerusalem . " Lazarus covered his eyes ; he could restrain his tears no longer . His narrow shoulders shook . " I feel so responsible , "  |p221he  said . " If only he had not come back to Bethany . Truly , I would rather have stayed in the tomb ! " " No , Lazarus , no , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knees , they embraced him and tried to comfort him . " Jesus would not have it so . It would only hurt him . " They talked it over more quietly when prayers had been said and they were at their evening meal . " We must do what we can to protect him , " Lazarus said . " As you say , Jesus would never miss the Passover . And he will probably stay here , at least a few days , as he always does . " Lazarus studied the bread he was about to dip , trying to conceal his concern . He did n't want to worry them needlessly . " But after we 've seen him , I think we should go to Jericho for a while . We could rest there , it would be good for all of us . " The women gasped . " But what about the Passover ? " " I think it would be wiser if I did n't appear at the feast myself this year . " His sisters were dumbfounded . The room had grown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fresh coals to the brazier . " Then you 're afraid your life , too , may be in danger ? " " On , no , no , no , " Lazarus protested . " Only that my presence could be "  --  he hesitated  --  " an embarrassment for Jesus , " he said carefully . " I 'm not afraid for myself , only for him . And of course for you , " he added , " in case anything should happen to either of us . You 've both been through enough . " Suddenly Lazarus straightened and began to eat . His tone was once more crisp , decisive , even cheerful . " But come now , what am I saying ? Let 's not borrow trouble . Where is our faith ? " he chided . " I am here , alive and well , your brother who was dead ! Forgive me for worrying you . " His sharp face brightened . " If Jesus can perform such a miracle , he can perform others . Let 's worry no more , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joy we ever did  --  and more . ... Martha  --  " Lazarus turned to her , smiling . " Begin preparing now . We 'll feed Jesus and those hungry men as we never have before . And this time we wo n't let them slip off the way they did the last time . We 'll see that they stay long enough to enjoy the victory with us . " Martha moved silently about the table , serving . Yes , oh , yes , she was thinking  --  to see Jesus again ! There had been only one flaw in that incredibly joyful night of her brother 's resurrection : in the veryp222midst of the mad celebration , Jesus had slipped away without giving her a chance to thank him . Without even saying goodbye . Now once more they waited , with an anticipation that had only grown more intense . Each morning Martha awoke with a sense of excitement and urgency , for this would surely be the day . Before nightfall he would come , he would come , leaping up the steps , arms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light , and even now a loving smile upon his full , sweet lips . Nothing had changed , she told herself , over the chill ghost fears in her breast ; matters had only moved forwardat a swifter , more significant pace . Jesus ' hour would soon be at hand . And he would be tested , severely tested . Yet he would triumph , as he had triumphed at the tomb . She was a very direct person , despite her air of remoteness and dignity . She believed in him . Jesus would be , quite plainly and without foolish reasoning , their king . And she would serve him . Asking nothing more for herself than to love him , she would do his bidding : managehis servants , see that his robes were immaculate , that nothing went amiss in his kitchens  --  she would do the cooking herself . Thus Martha lay dreaming on her pillow long after Mary slept . And at sunrise , careful not to wake her sister , she sprang out of bed . She could hardly wait to begin . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in fact , she was serving him . Whether Mary helped or not did n't matter ; let her do as she wished . This was something Martha was determined to do for him : the fires started early , the bread baked , the roasts turning on the spits by midafternoon , the sweetmeats waiting . Every inch of the house scrubbed and shining , fresh oil in every lamp , fresh flowers in every container . And the food in the cupboards sufficient to feed a court . Never mind that most of it had to be thrown to the dogs or taken to the poor . Tomorrow she would start over . She worked with a calm certainty that neither Lazarus nor Mary could understand . Their eyes followed her with tender concern , and at times they tried to restrain her . Impatiently Martha shooed them away . " Passover is almost here  --  we must be ready ! " Ten days . Nine . . . eight . Next week ! . . . Oh , dear Lord , was it possible he might not come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the whole household was weary and discouraged with waiting , and Martha herself had lain down to rest , he was there . " Martha , Martha , come on , wake up ! " Lazarus was bending over her , his small brisk face radiant . " Jesus is asking for you . They are all just arrived from Ephraim  --  Peter , James and John , Judas  --  the lot of them . They 're swarming all over the garden , hungry as lions . Mary is already attending to the basins and towels . But the meal . . . Come appease them , you 're the only one who knows what to do about the meal . " Martha sprang up , for a moment frantic . To be caught napping ! Her sandals  --  she must scramble around for them under the couch . The robe in which she had dozed was wrinkled ; she must change as fast as she could to the lovely new one that hung waiting . Her hair had slipped from its pins . She must . . . not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bid them welcome for me , " she said , determined to be calm . " I will come as soon as I can . " At last , breathing hard , but smoothly combed and looking graciousand composed in her silken dress , Martha went forth to greet him . Jesus was here at last , and she knew that was all that mattered . " Martha , dear Martha , " Jesus cried softly as he kissed her . " We could smell the fragrance of your roasting lamb all the way up the hill . You must have known we were coming . " There was something different about him ; Martha did n't know quite what . He seemed stronger , graver , and somehow gently and yet tragically wiser , however prosaic his words . " We have prepared for you every day , " she told him proudly , with a tight little smile , though her eyes were wet . " We knew you were coming , and yet we knew it not . We have been afraid for your safety . Lazarus tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all . " " Of course I was coming . Do you think I would actually miss the Passover , or not try to see you once more ? " " But you left so quickly last time  --  without even saying goodbye . You performed a great miracle for us , you gave us back our brother , and we could not even thank you . " " Martha , you have already thanked me beyond any need of words . And this time , although again we ca n't stay long , I assure you we will say goodbye . " Half whimsically , crooking a finger , Jesus wiped a knuckle across each teary eye.  |p224Martha  clung to him a minute , smiling and sniffling a little , like a comforted child . She excused herself then , and glided into the kitchen , her spirits soaring . It had not been in vain , all these days of preparation . Only a rehearsal , all of it a rehearsal for this perfect reunionmeal . Never , it seemed to her , had she chosen so fine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ savory odor filled the house ; it would be done within the hour . The vegetables too , if she got to them right away . The sauces would be even better for having stood since morning . She saw that Mary had not been idle , bless her heart . The best gold-rimmed plates and goblets were already lined up , waiting to be carried to the long table Lazarus had set up , no doubt at Mary 's insistence , in the garden . Despite the extra work it caused , Mary loved to eat outside . And Mary was right . There was more room in the garden . And the sun was setting , the air was cool and sweet . By the time the men had finished washing and praying and were gathered around the table , the first stars would be coming out , the lights beginning to sparkle in Jerusalem and across the Kidron Valley . " And the Paschal moon is rising earlier each night , " Martha added , as she complimented Mary . " We may not even need torches . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She seemed strangely subdued tonight , thoughtful and preoccupied . She dropped things . A handful of linen napkins had to be discarded ; thank goodnessthere were more in the hamper . Then a whole basket of bread slipped from her fingers . " Never mind , we have lots more , " Martha said kindly . ( She still winced to remember the time she had so foolishly exploded before Jesus ; he had been right to reprimand her . ) " But you seem so nervous . Are you tired ? Would you rather go visit with our guests ? If so , you do n't need to serve , I can manage . " " No , no , I will help you . " At last the men were seated . Lazarus had led the prayers and was pouring the wine . From beyond the open kitchen doorway Martha could hear the clinking glasses , the rise and fall of their voices as she dished up the food . " How serious they sound , " she remarked . " Not laughing and talking and arguing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " To her surprise , there was no answer . She turned , expecting to hand a steaming bowl to Mary.  |p225Martha  looked around in vain . . . . After she promised ! A flash of the old impatience smote Martha ; followed by the sting of her own remembered shame . No , no , it was not important . Had she not worked so desperately for just this hour ? Her dream come true . Jesus , the beloved , once more sitting at her table , with Lazarus , her brother . For an instant the miracle was overwhelming ; she was shaken by it , moved as never before . How could she have a single angry thought at such an hour ? Head high , feeling the object of some special privilege , Martha carried the heavy smoking joint of meat into the garden and set it down before her brother to be carved . She was aware of Jesus watching her from the opposite side of the table . Lifting her eyes to acknowledge his presence as guest of honor , she smiled . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and praised her as she moved gracefully among them , serving . There was the smell of moist damp woods and ferns , of mint and hyssop and marjoram from the garden , along with the savory odor of the meal . Night had fallen swiftly . The first stars were shining , like tiny jewels in the fingers of the trees . Lazarus had lighted the torches , which sent out little streamers of flame and drew shadows across the faces at the table . The brief sunset had left one russet banner burning above the valley , and in the distance the lights of the city could be seen . The moon was still hidden behind the mountains but rising , sending its silvery glow before it , casting a soft , almost ethereal light over everything . How beautiful it was ! Martha paused , drinking in the scene . Her only regret was that Mary was missing it . Martha looked toward the house , mystified . She would go look for her as soon as she had a minute . Why in the world ? This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around Jesus and his men ; their very presence seemed to nourish her bright spirits . It was hard to believe that she would disappearnow , of all times . This was the first time all of them could be together , like the family they seemed , to celebrate their miraculous reunion with Lazarus . And certainly Mary , who had grieved so wildly for her brother , ought to be here now , rejoicing . In fact , helping them rejoice more fervently , Martha thought , distressed . . . For again it came to Martha as she hovered , or moved back and forth to the kitchen , that thep226supper table , usually so lively with talk and songs and laughter , was tonight strangely silent . Something was wrong . Not with her food  --  no , they complimented it lavishly ; and certainly not with the setting  --  the moon was visible now , round and beaming , pouring out its brilliance . Yet instead of the happy sounds she had expected , the men were only conversing in low tones . Well , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And yes .. . worried . Martha halted , gripping her tray . For now suddenly it rose up in her and smote her , the thing she had stubbornly refused to think about all week . The awful possibility Lazarus had warned about when he came home that day from Jerusalem . Now she must face it : These men must be very careful of what they did and said . Not only Jesus , but even Lazarus . . . all of them . This Passover would be like no other . All the people would not be proclaiming Jesus , wanting to see and touch him , like those who had sought him here so eagerly ever since the miracle of her brother . There were other people who feared and hated him  --  some enough to kill him . And these men seated with him : Andrew , Peter , Thomas , Judas , the twins . . . In dismay , Martha 's eyes followed them around the table : Philip , Matthew , Bartholomew , Thaddeus , Simon , and the younger James . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dread fate they , too , might well be facing . No wonder Mary had fled . Martha 's heart went out to her sister . Despite Mary 's sparkling manner , she sensed things more quickly , responded more deeply , found pain harder to bear . I must go to her and comfort her as soon as I can , Martha thought . Mary is n't strong . But Martha was strong . She would not give way ; she would do all she could for these poor men . Right now she must not stand here brooding . The sweet was waiting ; she must clear away the crumbs and bones . The apostles made room for her as she moved among them with her tray , gathering up the scraps . They were her friends , her sweethearts , her children , and she rejoiced to serve them even as she grieved . As for Jesus , their leader and her Lord . . . he had moved his cushion back from the table and was leaning on one elbow , half reclining . Martha lingered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Could she bring him anything more ? But even as he liftedp227his face and smiled to thank her , he gave a little start and she sensed his awareness of another . For Jesus had glanced , in pleasant surprise , toward the door . And turning , Martha saw her sister , looking like an angel , standing there in its light . Mary had changed . She no longer wore her simple dress of the kitchen but was clad in softest shimmering white , bound at the waist with cords of gold . Gold flashed between her breasts , where she had pinned a shining crescent ; other golden crescents swayed and glistenedfrom her ears . Her long wavy chestnut hair was swept over one shoulder ; it , too , seemed brushed with gold in the light , and in it bloomed one pure white rose . Cupped carefully in her hands she held the family 's most priceless and cherished object , an alabaster jar . It had been their mother 's and their grandmothers ' before them , brought all the way from Egypt duringthe Exodus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used sparingly on special occasions , was kept the precious perfumed oil , nard . So unexpected was Mary 's appearance , so beautiful and startling , the men caught their breaths and shifted about as one . There was sudden silence ; even the desultory conversations at the table stopped . In the hush they could hear the rhythmic singsong of night things chirping , the hiss of the torches , the rustling of the leaves . All eyes were fixed on Mary . The moonlight pouring down enhanced the gold , and the shimmering whiteness of her dress . She seemed effulgent in the moonlight as she crossed the tiles on golden sandals , the dress seeming to float about her as she moved . She wore an expression both diffident and determined , a look both of rapture and ineffable sorrow , her gaze fixed on the vessel in her hands . She looked like a princess or a priestess about to perform some sacred rite . Oblivious to anyone but Jesus , Mary knelt before him . Removing the stopper from the jar , she poured the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his feet . Gently , adoringly , she massaged them , these tough strong feet that had walked so many miles to comfort and cure others  --  the soles , the heels , the instep , the toes , pausing only to replenish the oil . The apostles watched , respectful and deeply moved , except for Judas , who sat nearest . Judas had stiffened and was averting his eyes.  |p228But  now , when Mary seemed to have finished , Judas leaned forward , frowning slightly , and offered her a napkin with which to dry them . Mary shook her head . Taking her own hair in her hands , she kissed it , and spilling her hair across the feet of Jesus , Mary began to dry them with it . Calmly and slowly then , she rose and poured the rest of the oil onto the head of Jesus . The powerful fragrance of nard filled the garden . . . . Jesus could feel its wetness against his scalp and trickling down his beard ; he felt the warmth and tenderness of her fingers , stroking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart against the pain of leaving them . He loved them so much , and they loved him , they had given up so much for him  --  how they would suffer at his going . Yet he was comforted by these ministrations . Mary knew , as some women always know , how much a man needs the touch of a woman 's hands before he must go off to his agony alone . The vase was empty now , every drop gone . Mary replaced the stopper and lifted the lovely container up a minute , glistening in the light . The men , who had sat in humble wonderment , were stirred . They had seen many things during their travels : People running frenziedlyafter Jesus , beseeching him , pommeling him , pulling at him , trying to touch his garments . People who wept and kissed him after their healings , others who walked away without even thanking him , like those lepers on the road yesterday . On several occasions they had seen women pay the master this same beautiful tribute . But never before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never had they been so moved . Judas , however , sat stiff with disapproval and dismay . Demonstrationslike Mary 's had always made him acutely uncomfortable . He loathed such emotional displays . And the waste ! He gazed around , trying to maintain his cool composure , inwardly seething . It was hard to conceal his disgust  --  grown men acting like this . The fools ! Am I the only one who sees how ridiculous this is ? how inconsistent with everything Jesus teaches about giving to the poor ? Judas ought to know ; he was the treasurer for their travels , a job he shared with Matthew . Judas carried the purse , while Matthew , the experienced tax collector , kept the records . Money was always scarce , and so many beggarsfollowed them , whining and pleading , calling them cruel top229refuse . Holy men were n't supposed to refuse . Judas did n't give a hang about the beggars , or those generally stinking poor who came to be healed . Let them pay for their healings . Yet it irked him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he did n't mind spending it  --  on himself or on other people , for their enjoyment . But he hated waste . And that stuff was expensive . Worth three hundred dinars at least ! Yes , Lazarus could afford it . Lazarus was rich , he could afford to solve all their money problems . And after what Jesus had done for him , there ought to be a handsome reward . But this waste . To see a small fortune dumped like this . . . in a few minutes . When that oil could have been sold and the money given to them ! This was too much . Judas had to vent his indignation on someone . He sprang up and with a jerk of his head beckoned imperiously to Matthew , sure that his astute , hardheaded partner would agree with him . But again Judas was rebuffed . Even Matthew was wiping his eyes like some of the others . And seeing Judas ' expression , Matthew only scowled , shook his head and turned abruptly away . Judas flinched . But his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . Well , then , the sister . Though Mary was the one he usually flirted with and flattered , Judas had always felt a secret affinity with Martha . The quiet one , the practical one who got things done . He doubted seriously if Martha approved of this sentimental scene in the garden . He had not missed her little cry at sight of Mary , or how white and still she looked , standing by with her scraps after serving the meal . Waiting until it was finished , then turning to walk slowly back toward the kitchen . She was almost at the doorway now . " Martha ! " Judas called , and ran up the slope to confide in her , perhaps to console her . " May I speak with you ? " His tone was intimate ; the white scar near his mouth quivered . He would have held the door for her , even taken the tray , but she only stared at him , startled , blocking the way . " It 's about Mary , " he blurted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to know  --  I admire your restraint . You would never do such a thing . . . . And about that expensive ointment  --  " he said , troubled but solicitious . " You must be very upset . " Martha was too astounded to reply . She could only turn on him , appalled . As if she had suddenly seen a snake . Then , head high , she carried her pitiful burden into the house.  |p230Shaken  , Martha stood a moment , trying to find a place to set down the tray . She could hear the dogs whining and yapping outside the window  --  pariahs that had the habit of slinking down from the woods each night , drawn by the food she threw out . She must feed them ; they had come to expect it . But where to put things ? All this clutter ... Nudging a place on the table , she began to scrape the crusts and bones . Distractedly she opened the window and flung them out . Then she turned back , running a cold hand across her brow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had n't worked in such haste ... If only Mary  --  But no , no . Martha caught herself . It was n't Mary , it was that man . Judas ! Martha shuddered , felt almost ill . Contemptible . She had never liked him  --  the only apostle she felt uneasy about . He was too charming , too flattering , trailing Mary about , complimenting her , greedily admiring their furnishings . A handsome sycophant , especially around Lazarus , who did n't trust him , wondered sometimes why Jesus had even chosen him , let alone given him the purse strings . . . . Yet somehow pathetic too . That curiouslittle white scar quivering . He had looked . . . pitiful at the door . Who and what had hurt him to make him so ? Even in her outrage and revulsion , something in Martha ached for the child he must have been . But no  --  the white-hot anger flared again . How dared he criticize Mary ? It was n't his business what she did with the family 's rare perfume @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ halted , trembling , trying to sort out her chaos of emotions . Yes , at first she had been stricken . Mary 's sudden appearance , so unutterably beautiful in the moonlight . . . That old wound ! Martha felt as if it had been torn wide and she was bleeding , shamefully bleeding , though nobody noticed ; she wanted to hide from her own ignominious suffering , become invisible , simply vanish and leave them staring forever at the vision of Mary , like an angel descended from heaven , all white and gold . Then , quite as suddenly , the miracle of love and pride came flooding , so overwhelming she must brace herself , stand frozen , watching in awed amazement , lest she be swept away . And as Mary came toward them on her golden sandals , so carefully carrying the precious oil for Jesus ' anointing , Mary 's rapture became Martha 's too . Jesus was all that mattered  --  to comfort him , thank him , demonstrate to him and to his apostles how much their master was adored.  |p231Never  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admiration . She begrudged her sister nothing . Mary had done something more beautiful than Martha could imagine , let alone perform . ( If only she could ! ) Nothing anyone said could spoil it , certainly not a man like Judas . Martha 's anger at him was subsiding . That poor man , so .. . ignoble and yet somehow so poignant with his quivering scar . Jesus preached forgiveness and compassion . . . . Even so , she must composeherself before returning to the garden with her sweets . Martha managed to smile faintly as she moved about the kitchen . At least she could serve Jesus ' favorite cakes . Flaky triangles stuffed with dates and almonds , dipped in wine and honey before she baked them . She had originated the recipe and used it only for him . A humble tribute , but her own  --  the best she could do . She was aware , as she piled the cakes on a silver platter , that the atmosphere in the garden had changed . The hushed silence was over , the aura @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the men talking now , but to her surprise , they did not sound united . Martha halted , puzzled . The voices were rising , the way they did sometimes in argument . They were having some urgent discussion , and she sensed Jesus ' consternation . It seemed incredible that there would be dissension among them about anything this night . Unless , it flashed through her mind , Judas had stirred them up . Well , perhaps her cakes would calm them . Curious , Martha hastened down the slope . The moon was overheadnow , giving everything a radiance and clarity seldom seen by day . Every twig and leaf and flower was etched in silver ; the shadows of the fig trees traced a lacy pattern on the luminous white cloth , and flickered across the troubled faces of the men . Some of them still sat , heads low , as if embarrassed . Others had gotten to their feet . Peter , John and Andrew were standing closest to Jesus , in obvious support of all that he was saying . " Stop this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ risen and stood towering over everyone , one arm around Mary . " Leave Mary alone . There will be no more talk about selling things to feed the poor . The poor you will always have with you . But you will not always have me . " Jesus paused . Slowly , searchingly , his eyes moved among them , lingering on Judas . Judas stood a little apart , arms folded , head back ,  |p232coolly  defensive if not quite defiant . When Jesus spoke again , his voice was more sad than stern . " Have you forgotten so soon what I have told you ? That we are going up to Jerusalem , where I will be betrayed . I will be given over to the authorities . I will be killed and carried to the tomb . Mary knows this , " he said , gripping her hand , " Even though I have n't told her . Women like Mary know such things , and in their love prepare the living for that hour . What Mary has done tonight is a beautiful thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gospel . In pouring this ointment upon my body , she has prepared me for my burial . " Martha caught her breath , stifled the cry in her throat . Then the thing she had feared most was true ! Before , she could not face it , could not accept it . But now that he had spoken . . . Dazed , Martha went to the table and set down her tray . Nothing else mattered . She was grateful for Mary 's tribute . She could only pray that Jesus would be comforted by her little cakes.  |p233FEW  weeks before Passover that year , Hannah hobbled down the long hill that led into Nazareth . She was shriveled now and bent , for her bones had shrunk . She was tiny and gnarled , like an old tree stunted and broken by many storms , but still fiercely putting forth a few leaves , a little fruit . She had resolved that not another Passover would go by without doing something about the robe . For years she had dreamed about it : ever since that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Jerusalem for his presentationat the Temple . It would haunt her forever , the sight of her grandson , surely the most beautiful and gifted boy to kneel before the priest , not as well dressed as the others . ( Mary had cut down a robe of Joseph 's for him ; it was a little too big for him , and somewhat faded . ) One day she would make or buy him a beautiful robe . She had meant to do so long before this , but there had been other children and grandchildren , many duties , little money , and she had simply kept putting it off . But she had never forgotten . At first she had thought she would make it herself . She would bleach and comb the choicest wool from the finest sheep . She would spin the threads and weave it on her loom . She would shape it and cut it and sew its edges , being careful that it would flow softly about him , a robe without seams . She would embroider it lovingly , as his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fruits and flowers worked themselves out in her head . But the longer she put it off , the harder it was to begin . And as the years passed , Hannah realized she would have to buy it , after all . She was never quite sure of herself anymore as she sat at the loom . Her bony knees ached so ,  |p234her  feet were unsteady on the treadle , the threads tangled . Her daughters-in-lawwould rush to the rescue , not meaning to sound harsh but scolding that it was n't necessary now , there was plenty of cloth about the place , how much did she need  --  and what for ? At last she knew she could wait no longer . She had been having ominous dreams . She could not remember their content , only that a feeling of anxiety and urgency lingered . " Do it now ! " something seemed to be telling her . Her days were numbered ; unexpected things happened . If Jesus was ever to have the garment he deserved , she 'd better get at it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saving for years to Reb Levi , Cleo 's father . His shop was still the best in Nazareth ; he could have it made for her . If she had enough .. . It pleased her to discover the bag was heavier than she thought . She had to rest several times just lugging it into town ; and when she finally hobbled into Levi 's store , she set it down to ease her aching shoulder . " Hannah ! " cried her old friend and adversary . " What a pleasure to see you . How long has it been  --  months , years ? You do n't get into town often enough for me to recognize you anymore . Shame on you ! " Levi wagged a playful finger , but he was eyeing her with sad dismay . She had once been so lively and pert , bouncing around , her voice tart but always clear , never creaking . How Hannah had aged ! But there was still the familiar spunk about her , an amusing spark in her deepseteyes . " What can I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have come to see about a robe , " Hannah said . Bending , careful of one hip , she lifted the bag with both hands and set it smartly on the counter . " For my eldest grandson . The son of Joseph and Mary , " she could not resist adding . " Oh , yes . That one . " Reb Levi said , cooling . Hannah could almost feel him wince . He was a proud man ; would he never get over the fact that his handsome if reckless son had been rejected as not good enough for her daughter ? But that was all so long ago , Hannah fretted . How could it still matter , since Cleophas himself had remained so close to the family ? Held Mary 's children on his knees , become like a father to them , especiallyJesus , after Joseph was gone . . . . Poor Joseph  --  Hannah bit her lips and blinked rapidly  --  who had not lived to see this day . Whilep235Cleophas . . . somehow it seemed to her that Cleo had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never held a grudge . Hannah was impatient with Levi , but sorry she had irked him . Nonetheless , she held her ground . " Yes , that one . Jesus . I would like to see some material . He will be going up for the Passover , preaching at the Temple before many people . I want him to have the best . " Levi bowed courteously and with an air of proud authority led the way past the perfumes , jewelry , rugs and other fine objects , to where the fabrics were displayed . But Hannah was surprised to notice his shuffling gait . His hair and beard , once so black and curly like his son 's , were gray now , and thin , almost scraggly . And he had been such a strong man ; she remembered how he 'd gone storming out of the synagogue the day Mary and Joseph 's banns were read . What a giant ! It hurt her to see him now  --  puffing as he struggled with the heavy bolts of cloth , trying to pull one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rushed up to help him , much as her daughtersin-lawrushed to her aid at the tangled loom . And she thought sadly , How he has aged . Levi impatiently thrust the clerk aside , and began shuffling the fabrics around , slamming one down , holding a length between his arms , discarding it suddenly , almost as Hannah reached out to touch it . A subtle combat seemed to be going on between them , yet he seemed genuinely to be trying to please her . . . . Such a dazzling array : silks , velvets , brocades , linens , purest white woolens , striped fabrics of every kind . Hannah was bewildered , jealous of their beauty , wantingthem all . Her fingers shook as she felt them , stroked them . " Oh , my ! They 're all so beautiful . It 's  --  I 'm not sure . I just want him to have the best . " " Of course , that 's what we will try to find for such a personage as your grandson , " said Levi , kindly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; he is certainly the talk of Galilee . " " And Judea ! People flock to hear him wherever he goes . Jerusalem  --  theysay the crowds in Jerusalem will be greater than ever at Passover this year because he 'll be there . " Hannah caught herself , heart pounding , ashamed of bragging so . She stared at Levi , suddenly concerned . His voice had always been furry , but never harsh , breathy , rasping . Several times he 'd paused to cough , shielding his thick lips with a big yet somehow dainty hand . " Levi , " she asked sharply , " havep236you seen a doctor about that cough ? It does n't sound good to me . Perhaps if I made a poultice  --  " " No , Hannah . " He shook his head . " I wish Jesus was here . He helps people , you know . Heals them , cures the sick  --  lepers , even . Many people can attest to it . " Levi recovered from his fit of coughing , regained his dignity . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is he ? " They went back to the business of the cloth . " Look at this piece , " the merchant said . And oh , but it was beautiful  --  of purest white linen , and delicately embroidered with rose and blue and golden threads . The most elegant thing she had ever seen . She touched it longingly . " Oh  --  oh ! It must be very dear . I want him to have a really fine robe , " she reasoned , troubled . " Then he shall have one ! Choose this , Hannah ; you 'll never regret it . What are his measurements ? " " But the cost . Will I have enough coins ? " she pleaded . " Never mind , " Levi said grandly . " We are old friends . " He threw up his hands in a genial wave , settling it . " You will have enough for both the fabric and the tailor . Only tell me Jesus ' measurements and how you wish this robe to be made . " His very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Hannah did n't know how to thank him . " He 's a tall man , you 've seen him yourself with Cleophas  --  very handsome and broad and strong , " she said , confused . " Just make it a fine robe , all in one piece , a robe without seams . " To Hannah 's pleased surprise , Levi accompanied her to the door . He was limping slightly ; she could hear the rattle in his chest . He had no grandsons , not one , and she had so many . Her heart went out to him . " And it must be done in time for the Passover , " she reminded . " All eyes will be upon him . " " You have come to the right place . It will be finished long before . Someone will take the robe to Jesus ? " asked Levi . " One of your other grandsons , perhaps ? " " Well , I thought maybe Cleo "  --  it occurred to Hannah suddenly  --  " since he , too , will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the story of the Biblical Joseph and his coat of many colors . How his brothers had been so jealous they had actually sold him into Egypt as a slave . No , for shame  --  Mary 's other sons were not like that ; why ,  |p237they  had fought to protect Jesus from the mob outside the synagogue ! Still , Hannah felt uneasy and somewhat embarrassed . " And should you see anyone else in the family , please do n't tell them about this , " she said anxiously . " Let it be our secret . I want it to be a surprise . The secret will be safer with Cleo . " " Whatever you wish , " said Levi , smiling to himself . Evidently , having many sons and grandsons was not an unmixed blessing . Cleophas rode up in time to see Hannah departing . She did not hear his greeting ; she was getting a little deaf . His father still stood in the doorway , faintly smiling . Levi explainedthe encounter , and with a gesture of tender amusement , picked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell Hannah , of course  --  it would hurt her pride  --  but this wo n't even cover the fabric . " Cleophas nodded , looking serious . " Spare no expense , " he said . " Add a sash with a golden buckle . I myself will make up the difference . Whatever it takes , make it the finest robe we have ever made . Jesus is my friend  --  more than a friend , he 's like a son . I want Mary 's son to have the best . " Shortly before the Passover , Mary was on her knees preparing the soil in her flower garden when Ann came hastening down the path . Her plain , usually calm sweet face was excited . " Mother , there is a young man asking for you . A courier , come all the way from Bethel , he says . It must be a letter from Jesus ! " Mary gave a little cry and flung down her trowel . Gathering up her skirts , she ran past her daughter to the house . She is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl who lives for word from the beloved . A pity Jesus ' letters were so rare . The family often discussed it among themselves . Was it not for this , the story went , their mother had learned to read ? The boys joked about it wryly , proud if a bit embarrassed at having a mother who could bring the excitement of a messenger to their door . For Mary 's sake they were pleased whenever a letter arrived , but they were also secretly humiliated and a little hurt . Her other sons had no cause to write to her , living right here underfoot in Nazareth , hewing trees , building houses , making a decent living for their families . They did not journey to far , exciting places , making speeches ,  |p238attracting  crowds , doing wild and dangerous things . They teased her about the letters sometimes , joking to hide their feelings . Mary found the house swarming . Ann and Leah had brought their children ; they wanted to go shopping , Mary was to mind the little ones . Josey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young messenger , who said his name was Caleb . The boy 's eyes drank in the sight of Mary . " Are you Mary , the mother of a man called Jesus ? " he asked eagerly . " Yes , I am his mother , " Mary said with the old fear . " Is he all right ? " " I 'm sure of it , although I did not see him this time . The letter was given to me in Bethel by one of his followers , a man named Andrew . It was written a few days before , I believe , while your son was resting elsewhere  --  Ephraim , his friend told me . " Trembling , Mary accepted the small roll he pulled from a tube around his neck . The children were racing noisily about . She was aware of her family hovering , curious and surprised . She could not bear to open it in front of all of them . " You have had a long journey . " She smiled , trying to regain her composure . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Asking her daughters to prepare the basins and food , Mary hurried back into the garden . She sat for a moment rejoicing , holding the scroll against her breast . A letter from Jesus ! Never mind that in the past three years there had been only four : one written from the house of Peter in Capernaum ; one composed on a rocking boat on the Sea of Galilee ; one written on a hillside beyond Caesarea Philippi ; one from Jerusalem  --  the house of someone named Nicodemus . She knew them by heart , she had read them over and over ; they were her treasures . Now she unrolled the parchment , though her hands were shaking so it was hard to make out the words . Jesus was in Ephraim , he said , a small town near Jerusalem , where he 'd taken his apostles for instructionsbefore returning to the city . He was aware  --  the knowledge had come to him strongly  --  that she planned to come to the Passover Feast . He begged her not to . Though he loved her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unsettled right now . There were rumors of danger . He would spare her what might happen . But if she insisted on coming ( as , knowing her nature , he feared she would ) , she mustp239go to the house of Lazarus in Bethany . " It is a big house , high on the second ridge of the Mount of Olives . Ask in the village . Lazarus is well known  --  anyone can direct you . " Lazarus and his sisters would make her welcome , along with whoever came with her . Either Jesus would be there himself or they would know where he could be found ... . Mary read the words again , torn between joy and distress . Finally she rose and went back up the path into the house . The messenger was preparing to leave . Though they were politely urging him to spend the night , he wanted to start back as soon as possible . " Do you wish to send a message to your son in return ? " he asked . Mary wavered . " There is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quietly , glancing over her shoulder at the family as she led him to the door . She waited until the two of them were alone on the steps . " Tell Jesus that I will heed his words and pray for guidance . If it is the will of the Father that I be with him at this Passover Feast , I will come . " Something in the boy 's eyes clutched her heart . Caleb stood hesitant . His voice was awed as he said , " Not long ago I had the honor of carrying a message to your son . Even though I found him , I 'm afraid  --  I 'm sorry to confess  --  I did not recognize him then . But now that I do , I want you to know  --  I am doubly honored . It is a privilege to meet and carry a message to him from the mother of my Lord ! " Mary 's eyes filled . Smiling , she reached out and pressed his hand . " Thank you , " she whispered . " God go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voices behind her . The room fell quickly silent as Mary returned . They had been talking about her , Mary realized , speculating about the letter . They regarded her now with frank curiosity and concern . Reluctantly , Mary parted with the scroll , handing it to James . They were her family , she loved them , this involved them all . " Read this , if you wish , " she said . Wordlessly , each son studied it and passed it on , even to the girls  --  whom Mary herself had taught to read . James spoke first . " Jesus is right , " he said , his sensitive face troubled . " It would be unthinkable for you to make this journey now . Or for any woman . " He indicated his pregnant wife . " It could be dangerous , with so much unrest . " " Yes , Mother , " Ann protested anxiously . " Why now ? Why wouldp240you even consider it now , when you have n't made the trip since our father died ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know he needs me . I want to be with him . " " Jesus needs you ? " josey burst out sarcastically . " What about us ? Do n't we need you ? What if something should happen to you ? " He snatched the scroll from Leah , who was pondering it , and tapped it with an angry finger . " This unrest our brother speaks of  --  why does n't he mention that he 's known to be the cause of it ? I did n't want to bring this up again  --  I did n't want to worry you , Mother  --  but there have been stories that the Sanhedrin wo n't put up with him much longer . There 's trouble every time ; I shudder to think what might happen if he shows up at the Passover . I do n't think any of us should go . Dangerous for our mother ? It could be dangerous for all of us ! " " But we men at least are obliged to go , " James reminded . " It 's the Law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lives ? " Josey demanded . " Or the life of Jesus himself ? Yes , it could come to that , " he said , as they gasped . " He could be in mortal danger . We 'll have to talk this over with Simon and Jude , but I think they 'll agree . Instead of going ourselves , we should try to find our brother , as we have before , and stop him from going . " Impatiently he scanned the scroll once more . " What is that town he writes from ? " " Ephraim , " Mary said quietly . " Did n't you hear what the courier said ? But he was to be there only a few more days . Jesus may be already on his way to Jerusalem . " The morning after this squabble , Mary carried her letter to the roof . She had scarcely slept all night . She must come up here where the curds were drying and a breeze was blowing from the hills , and try to decide what she must do . Benjy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at her feet . The dog was getting old . It was n't fair to take him on such long journeys anymore . " I 'll feel better if he 's with you , " Jesus had said before he left the last time . " He can protect you , Mother , and he 'll be company for you . " " I 'm quite safe "  --  Mary had laughed  --  " and I have plenty of corn/pany . But you know I love the dog , and he will be a comfort to me , with you so far away . " At first Ben refused to stay behind . Waking to find his master gone , he had run frantically down the road in pursuit . Cleo had ridden after him , caught him and carried him home before him on his saddle . After a few days of the animal 's grieving and refusing to eat , Mary , with the help of Cleophas , managed to get some food into him . Ben clung to both of them now , scorning all others , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now suddenly the dog lifted his head and , barking joyously , bounded down the steps . Cleo ! Mary thought gratefully . Ben always seemed to sense his presence . She went to the parapet and called down to him where he knelt , hugging the dog and playfully roughing his fur . Cleophas looked up and came quickly , Ben at his heels . Despitehis usual bright debonair manner , Mary saw that something was troubling him too  --  though at first he spoke only about the robe . The garment was finished , Cleo told her ; he had personally overseen the project , even ridden up to Capernaum himself to see about a finer silk for the girdle . He was sure Hannah would be very pleased . " As your mother requested , I have said nothing to anyone about it except you . I will take it to her tonight for her approval . " " I 'm sure she 'll love it . It must be beautiful . " " But I want you to see it , too , before it 's delivered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if you both agree , I will take it with me when I leave for Jerusalem tomorrow . " " Tomorrow ? " Mary stared at him , bewildered . " But the caravan does n't leave for the festival for several days . " " I have important business to attend to , " Cleophas claimed . " I do n't want to wait for the caravan . Can you tell me where I might find Jesus ? I understand you had a letter from him yesterday  --  the courier stopped in the shop , asking directions . " " Yes , I was just waiting to show it to you . I need your advice about what I should do . " Gratefully Mary drew the scroll from her bosom . " Oh , Cleo , I 'm so glad you 've come . I 've been beside myself with worry . My sons do n't understand . " She tried to tell him about it as he read the message . " The girls , yes  --  Ann and Leah came and sat with me last night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I feel ; they , too , believe in Jesus and would stand by himp242if they could . Ann even offered to go to Jerusalem with me , if that was my decision . I ca n't let her , of course  --  she has her own family to think of . But the boys are saying terrible things , at least Josey , Jude and Simon . They do n't think any of us should go to the Passover , certainly not me ! " Cleophas rose from the bench , his face grave as he handed her the scroll . It was a moment before he replied . " For once your sons are right , " he said soberly . " No , Mary , you must not go . " He began to pace the roof , the dog padding faithfully beside him . " If I were your husband I would forbid it . But since I 'm not "  --  Cleo gave a little groan and drew a fist across his brow  --  " I can only beg you . Jerusalem is not a safe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " But Jesus needs me ! I know it , I feel it . " Mary was staring blindly into the distance , clutching the letter to her breast . " No matter what anybody says , I want to be there . Something tells me I have to be with him . " Despairing , Cleophas crouched beside her and took the parchmentfrom her , that he might read it again . And his heart sickened , for the words only reinforced the rumors that had been flying , and the news he had heard from a Roman before leaving the shop a few moments ago . The Sanhedrin in Jerusalem had met ; lesser sandhedrins throughout the land were being warned : The presence of Jesus at the Passover was considered a threat ; they feared an uprising . Firm orders had gone out for Jesus ' arrest . Cleophas shuddered ; his blood ran cold . If this succeeded , if they actually brought him in , it was not unlikely he could be put to death . But how could he tell Mary this ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he wants to spare you . And so do I. I pray you will change your mind . " He rose and stood considering , deeply troubled . But if he dissuaded her and this terrible thing happened  --  would she ever forgive him , or herself ? Did anyone have the right to keep a mother away from her son at such a time ? He drew a long , painful breath . " But if you insist , " he said at last , " if you are convinced you must go , then I want to be with you . " Cleo sat down beside her and gripped her small white hand . His voice was not quite steady . " And if anything should happen to Jesus ... heaven forbid , but if anything should happen , " he muttered thickly , " let me take care of you . "  |p243To  his distress , Mary drew quickly back , small , proud , unyielding . " My sons will take care of me , " she informed him . " But you tell me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Cleo protested . " Mary , this is serious . When Josey and James  --  any of them  --  would actually disobey the Law rather than take the chance  --  " " James may go , " Mary claimed hopefully . James would do anything for Jesus , he would go in a minute , but his wife was begging him not to . Not that Mary blamed her ; the girl was so young , and expecting another child . " I remember that terrible week Joseph went up to the Passover without me , because of the babies . I had a dreadful premonition . It was the most agonizing time I 'd ever spent , waiting for him to return . And when I saw him , his face bruised and bloodied . . . ! The Romans had ridden them down where they worshiped , right in the Temple . It was a miracle any of them escaped ! " " I remember , " said Cleophas . " I was there . " Patiently he sat listening , his square jaw set , as she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now lay still on the floor beside him , eyes blissful , half closed . It hurt , it hurt , to hear these frequent reminiscencesof Joseph , yet curiously his heart always quickened . He had developed a strange hunger for them ; though it was another man Mary dwelled on , that man had been his friend , the brother he 'd never had . Mary 's words brought Joseph back . . . . Still , it was he , Cleo , who was near to her now , feeling her warmth , smelling her delicate perfume , seeing the rise and fall of her bosom . Close enough to love , futilely or not . Meanwhile , his mind coped with the problem . " Mary , listen . " Cleophas sprang up suddenly . " Never mind the others . If you are determined to go , I will take you . You can go with me tomorrow . " Mary was startled . " No , No , impossible . I can go with the caravan . I will be quite safe with the caravan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the caravan . And a caravan is too slow  --  all those people and mules and donkeys , all that baggage . I may as well tell you : The quicker we get there the better . " Mary was staring at him , alarmed in a way she had not let herself be before . " Cleophas , what is it ? " she whispered . " Is there something you have n't told me ? " " Yes , " he acknowledged miserably . " It 's one reason I came . I would like to spare you , but you will hear it soon enough . By nowp244your family has probably heard it . The rumors are true  --  the Sanhedrin has put out warrants for Jesus ' arrest . " Mary paled . She gazed at him bleakly for a moment , and a small cry escaped her , a pitiful , almost mute whine , like an animal that has been struck or badly wounded . Cleo could n't stand it . " Mary , do n't , " he begged . " Please do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stop the sounds . But her hands groped blindly about . Cleo reached down and held her until her violent shaking stopped . " Hush now , hush , hush , it 's all right , " he muttered . Yes , she must think , she must not give way to this . She must keep control , she must plan . Mary made a feeble gesture . " Then you 're right  --  we must not lose any time . I will pack tonight . I will . . . Let me think  --  which donkey ? The best one is lame ; the other one  --  I believeJude needs it for hauling some timbers tomorrow . " " Never mind donkeys , " Cleo said . " We do n't need donkeys , I will have horses . " " But I have never ridden a horse , " Mary cried . " Cleo , I 'm afraid . " " It will be a gentle horse , and I will ride beside you . Mary , " he said sternly , seeing that she was pale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as I now believe you should , you must be willing to do as I ask . " " But horses ! " Mary gasped . " Only Romans ride horses , horses are pagan , no decent Jewish woman  --  " " What about a decent Jewish man ? " he broke in . " Yes , " she acknowledged , " some , a few like you . But you have always been a law unto yourself . " " Mary , you are the mother of Jesus , who has already broken many traditions . Would you be unwilling to break one more if it meant reachinghim in time ? Possibly even to help him ? " " All right , yes , anything  --  forgive me . But , Cleophas , another thing , " Mary said nervously , suddenly remembering . " We can not travel alone together . It would not be seemly ! " It was exactly what he needed . That Mary , in her innocence , should consider such a matter now . Cleophas threw back his head and laughed . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite safe . " He wiped his eyes and , bending down to her again , took her hand and kissed her fingertips . " But you are right . I would have no word said against you . Fortunately , this can easily be resolved , I think . Only yesterday in Capernaum I learned that several of the women whop245traveled with the apostles were preparing to leave for Jerusalem . Peter'swife told me . It 's possible we may overtake them . " " Then it is serious , " Mary said , dazed as the truth bore in . " Otherwisethey would not go so far , or start so soon . " " Yes , Mary , there 's no use denying it . But one thing more : The woman called Magdalene  --  I spoke with her at Peter 's house . She is coming to Nazareth tonight . She wanted to see you before going on . She will be riding a donkey , I suppose , but I will have a horse ready for her too . If things work out as I hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They left the next morning , shortly after daybreak . Roosters were crowing , birds beginning to sing . The dove-gray sky was gradually brightening , the air was crisp and cold . Benjy circled the horses , sniffing their strangeness , barking furiously and bounding away when one of them kicked . Ann darted out of the house to hold him back while Cleophas lifted her mother into the saddle . Mary 's face was white with fear . She struggled , groping for the slippery leather reins , which Cleophas placed firmly in her hands . He tucked her skirts about her attentively , like a husband , and accepted the blanket that Leah brought him . This , too , he tucked efficiently about Mary 's legs  --  where she sat sidewise , obviously afraid of falling . He tipped back his head and smiled at her reassuringly . The woman Magdalene was already seated on a big black horse , quite composed . And though the beast stamped its hooves and tossed its magnificent head , she only leaned forward to pat its sleek neck . Obviously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her fulllippedoval face was very beautiful beneath its sheltering hood . Her dark eyes smiled at Mary 's daughters , who stood watching the preparationswith a mixture of anxiety and excitement . They had left their own families to see their mother off . They were determined to stand by her  --  what 's more , to make her guest feel welcome . Mary 's announcement the day before had rocked the family . That she would decide to leave so suddenly , with Cleo ! Her sons , at least , were shocked . Cleophas must be mad to suggest such a thing , or their mother herself must be ill . And to leave on horseback , of all things , with a woman like Magdalene . Bad enough that a woman with such a past had become a prominent follower of Jesus . Whether she wasp246reformed or not , it still did n't look right . It was embarrassing to have her show up in Nazareth right now , like a friend of their mother 's . Mary herself had misgivings at first . Oh , no , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decision to go at all was sure to cause such consternation . And her own feelings about Magdalene troubled her . Several times , when there was no one to go with her , Mary had ridden off , against the wishes of her sons , to find the place where Jesus was preaching . " Mary , Mother Mary ! " Magdalene always cried , running to greet her . Curiously , Mary had not wanted to be called Mother by this beautiful woman who obviously hungered to draw close to her , to love her , and through her learn more about her son . For as they worked together around the house or camp , or walked together along the road , Magdalene begged her to share memories of Jesus , from the beginning : what he had been like as a little boy , his friends and family , his schooling , when the great knowledge of his mission had come upon him ... Mary was torn . Her heart went out to this motherless woman , yet something within her resisted . She did not want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The old unreasonable fears rose up in her , the anxiety even then lest his course be diverted or affected in any way by human love . He had already endured such torment and triumphed over it ; he had enough to contend with , let him be spared anything more . But now nothing mattered except getting to Jesus . If this was the only way , so be it . Let her put aside her own foolish feelings , the family might as well be horrified by one more thing .... And when Mary actually saw Magdalene the night before  --  her sweetness , her beauty , like an angel in her simple dark blue wrap , with her soft hair shining  --  every reservation vanished . They fell into each other 's arms , weeping . And later they went together to Hannah 's house , where Cleophas was waiting to show them the robe . Nor had Hannah withdrawn from Magdalene , as Mary had feared , but only held her close , and wept with them . " If only I could go with you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were undertaking was but a cause for celebration . " Did you ever see a more beautiful robe ? " she gloated , spreading it out before them . Jesus would be so surprised . They must tell her all about it when they returned  --  how itp247fit him , how it became him , how many people admired it , what they said . " If only I could be there " she cried , " see for myself ! " " You will see , " Cleophas said kindly , glancing at Mary . " The next time Jesus comes back to Nazareth , he will model it for you . " " Well , let us hope , but at my age  --  " Only then did Hannah begin to tremble , her sunken eyes dim . " I wish Joachim had lived to see his triumph ! " Thank heaven Hannah had n't heard yet . If only there were some way to keep the truth from her , they agreed , walking back to Mary 's house , where Magdalene would spend the night . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Ann and Leah , those dear girls , had slipped into Jesus ' room to put fresh rushes on the floor , fresh linens on the bed . A small charcoal fire was burning ; there were flowers on the chest . And now this morning , at the last minute , James , Jude and Simon came hurrying up . Partly to inspect the horses , and perhaps to make a final effort to dissuade her . Their opposition had nothing to do with Magdalene , Mary realized ; their only concern was her safety . " Be careful , " they pleaded , though they trusted Cleo ( he had taught all of them to ride ) . . . . " Do n't worry , " he assured them . " She 'll do fine . We 'll avoid Samaria  --  if I were riding alone I 'd chance it , but not with your mother . We 'll take the Jordan mountain route . " It seemed to Mary that her sons were almost envious : they might even change their minds about the festival . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll run to get my things . If there 's still time , I 'll come with you . I could ride behind you ! " Mary shook her head . Curiously , she did not want him ; she had a sense of freedom and escape , to have asserted herself like this and be riding off with outsiders . James gave her a small package containing a present for Jesus . " Tell him I 'm not sure  --  I will come if I can . Tell him I love him . " They set off at last , Mary still stiff and frightened in the saddle . But when she turned gingerly to look back , she was touched by their still-anxious faces as they waved . She had misjudged her children : Whatever they did was because of love . Cleophas rode close beside Mary the first few miles , talking in a cheery , soothing singsong both to her and to the horse . " Easy now ,  |p248steady  , that 's right , gently , gently , there 's a good girl , steady now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to cross a stream , it 's all right , let go , you 're as safe as in your own bed . " At times he reached over to pat her or the white mare , whose head reached forward continually in rhythm with its flowing muscles . At times he threw back his big head and sang , comical songs Mary had never heard before . Magdalene , trotting a little way in front , slowed down , turned her face and smiled . Gradually Mary 's tensions eased . She stopped grasping the saddle horn in terror every time the creature lurched ; she let the reins slacken as Cleophas suggested . Above her misery , the sick and trembling anxietyabout what lay ahead , she could not ignore the beauty and wonder of the world . She dared to look around and try to enjoy the bright morning . From this living , moving perch , how different the world seemed ! She had always been so small , she was seldom eye level with people ; now she could look down on the heads a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be eye level with the flowering trees  --  how sweet the fragrance of almond and persimmon blossoms  --  or to duck under them , with their dew-wet branches across your face .. . They rode across the boggy Plain of Esdraelon , still wet and puddledwith the last of the winter rains , soft and green under the ploddinghooves , surrounded by the mountains . Cleophas told them they would cross the lower slopes of the Gilboas . The view would be beautifulfrom there , and they could bypass the pagan city of Scythopolis , once known as Beth Shean , where most people stayed , and be that much nearer their destination by nightfall . He knew of an inn much farther along the road . The highland forests were bursting with saffron and purple crocuses , the hills a riot of narcissus in a hundred hues . At times they pulled up and rested , gazing out across the green velvet plains and valleys . And Mary 's spirits rose , the terrible fear was quieted . She even managed to laugh a little at some of Cleo 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rich , throaty voice she had , and her laughter rang out at times like birdsong . Mary sensed they were being deliberately cheerful for her sake ; trying to divert her . When they stopped at a well , Magdalene insisted on drawing the water and bringing it to Mary , even sponging its coolness on her face and hands . Cleo went off into the roadside grasses and came back flushed and proud as ap249boy , with his arms full of flowers . Mary plunged her face into their bright colors , drinking in their sweetness , and rode for a time with them tucked in her girdle , one of them in her hair , for the day was now warm enough for them to throw back their hoods . How foolish are most of our fears , Mary told herself . How needlesslywe suffer over things that may not happen . She remembered her terror of the horse , which so quickly became her friend , its powerfulrhythms carrying her swiftly , safely to Jesus . Her apprehensions about Magdalene ; the problems with her sons . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother had n't blinked an eye , at either Magdalene or the journey , and had only been excited about her robe . Mary smiled . Dear Mother , going to all that trouble . It was comforting to think of the lovely garment secure in the saddlebag beside her ... . They would soon see Jesus ! They would find him safe and well , and he would wear the robe proudly there at the Passover , perhaps even in some glorious unspecified triumph , as Hannah so hopefully predicted . Thus Mary mused , to the rhythmic beat of the hooves , while the beautiful countryside seemed to flow about them . By late afternoon , however , anxiety and discouragement began to claim her . They had encountered few people on the shortcut Cleophas had chosen to avoid Scythopolis . It was finally necessary to take the highway , however ; and when they reined up and gazed down upon it , they were astonished to discover it crowded as far as the eye could see . The sound of many hooves came up to them , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the voices . An entire camel caravan was passing , the beasts bulging with goods to be sold at the festival . There seemed to be no women and children among those who followed , for these were merchants getting an early start . Businessmen from Syria , Babylonian dealers clad in heavy silks and turbans , some on foot but most mounted or carried in litters . Slaves were pulling carts , or bent double with the enormous bundles on their backs . There was no choice but to ride down among them and pass as quickly as possible . Before descending , both women hastily donned their veils . The air on the Gilboan slopes had been cool and sweet ; here the heat smote them like a sudden merciless fist . There was the sour-sweet stench of animals and sweaty human bodies , of garlic and dung and a spicy , oaty fragrance that came from the baggage . The dinp250after the silence was defeaning  --  hooves clattering on the pavement , bells ringing , donkeys braying , the shouts and laughter of the men , gesticulating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : two veiled but obviously beautiful women riding horses ! Wives or concubines , no doubt , of the powerful-looking black-haired man who expertly guided them through and around the maelstrom . The heat , the stench , the noise . . . Mary was reminded of those last desperate hours when she and Joseph had first struggled to reach Bethlehem . Her horse shied when a camel bared its teeth and emitted its hideous shriek as she passed . She was so startled she was almost jerked from her perch . Cleophas was instantly beside her , but Mary was frightened . Her flowers had long since wilted . Her back ached from the unaccustomedposition in the saddle ; her hips were sore . She felt hot , dirty and very tired ; and then  --  as they rode on , far ahead of the other travelers , and the sun lowered  --  chilled , stiff with cold . Pulling her cloak about her , Mary huddled deeper , praying that they would reach the inn before dark , as Cleo promised . " Be patient , " he urged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miles . " The two women exchanged commiserating glances . Mary saw that Magdalene , though younger , must be as tired as she was . And when at last they reached the inn , it was little better than a square stone wall , moss-grown and decrepit , with an open enclosure for the animals , and a wooden loggia to shelter the people . A few travelers were already wearily climbing its steps , to hurl down their bundles and unroll their cloaks on the floor . There was , however , a small whitewashed building where the manager lived with his family . Cleophas tied the horses , and bidding them wait , strode confidently to the back of the house , where several ovens were smoking . Watching , Mary was again reminded of that night when Joseph had hurried into the inn , frantically seeking a place for her to bear her child . Magdalenereached over to press her hand . " Do n't worry , " she said . " Cleophas is a good man . He will take care of us . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The family kept several small rooms for people with gold in their pockets . He knew them well ; he had stayed here often . " There will be water brought to us , " he said , lifting the women down . " And food for our supper . " Mary had not realized how weak and trembling her legs werep251until she tried to stand . Cleo had to support her for a minute . Magdalenestumbled too . And later , as they were bathing , Mary noticed that Magdalene 's feet and ankles were badly swollen . " Oh , my poor girl , " she cried , " you must soak them in the basin for a while . Here , let me add more water . And I have some herbs that may help , if I can find them . " Over Magdalene 's protests , Mary searched her bags until she discovered the tiny packet and shook its spicy contents into the water . " Our feet have dangled all day , " she said . " Tomorrow we must remember to dismount and walk about more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Magdalene kept objecting as Mary knelt beside her with towels and oil . She reached out a restraining hand . " I 'm younger , I should be waiting on you . " " Nonsense . You are like my  --  " Mary could not bring herself to say " daughter . " " You are my friend . And my son 's were pleading . There was an instant of awkwardness between them as Mary went on drying her feet and massaging them with oil . " Yes , " Mary said finally , rising . " We both love him . And together  --  surelytogether we can help him . " The room was small and spare , smelling of mice and the rather acrid oil in the lamp that flickered in its niche . They could smell a bonfire burning somewhere ; its wood smoke drifted through the slit of window . The servant girl who brought them their supper suggested they eat outside ; a low table had been set on the stones . They would be warmed by the coals-still glowing in the ovens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gathered around their campfire on the hill . Cleophas was already there , seated on a cushion with his lute . He had washed himself and anointed his hair and beard , and donned clean garments . The women , too , had changed . They all felt refreshed , drinking the fig wine from Jericho which the manager saved for special guests , and devouring the excellent bread and meat . Mary had thought she was too tired to eat ; she had n't realized she was so hungry . The thing that had driven them so hard all day was n't mentioned ; they tried not to think of it . It was almost like a party . And after the finalp252prayers were said , they lingered under the stars , listening to the music of the shepherds , while Cleo softly strummed his lute . But when Mary lay on her pallet next to Magdalene 's , her torment began . Every bone and muscle ached , hooves pounded in her ears and began to stamp across her back and belly . She clutched herself and whimpered , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along beside Joseph on the donkey , fighting their way through the crowds on the highway , desperately trying to reach Bethlehem . In her misery Mary cried out . Startled , Magdalene rose up on her own pallet and reached over to comfort her . " Mary , dear Mary , what is it ? Why , you 're trembling , you 're cold . Here , let me wrap you in my cloak  --  it 's heavier and it 's really very cold in here . " Grateful to serve her , Magdalene tucked the cloak around her , and brought another blanket for her feet . " There now , that 's better . You were dreaming . Now you can sleep again ... . But as she turned away , Mary reached out to grip her hand , still moaning . " Tell me , " Magdalene pleaded , " what is it ? Please tell me , Mother Mary ! " " I 'm  --  in  --  labor ! " Mary gasped . " No , no , I 'm not mad  --  but I feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not bear it . It 's  --  with me  --  as it was the night he was born . That day Joseph and I were trying to get to Bethlehem in time . We were both afraid  --  I was so afraid . I 'd never had a child , my mother was far away , and the stable  --  you know he was born in a stable ? Thank God Joseph found room in that stable , but it was so cold at first  --  and it hurt , it hurts ! " Panting , Mary threshed about , the tears streaming down her face . Gently Magdalene bent to wipe them away . " It was warm by the time he came . There was this terrible pain  --  I nearly went mad , I could n't bear it  --  but then I heard him crying and he was in my arms , my precious baby ! There was ecstasy then : I have never known such joy . But this time , now , I am in agony  --  about to lose my baby ! " " Hush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " We will find him , he will be all right . " She sat for a time holding Mary 's hand , her own throat aching . And finally Mary quieted . " Forgive me , " Mary said at last . " This journey today has brought it all back so vividly . I 'll be all right now . Forgive me for keeping you awake , but it has helped to talk about it . "  | " I am honored that you told me . " " There were shepherds that night too , " Mary went on presently . " They gave us some soup . I will never forget  --  they , too , had built a roaring fire near the door . Hot barley soup , how good it tasted . And there were other shepherds ; we could hear them singing . And before the night was over some of them came to see us , shy and careful , not wanting to wake him but anxious to see him , bearing gifts . Such rude but loving gifts . Let me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as I recall , or no , maybe it was a sack of figs . Some rabbit skins , a sheepskinrug  --  I have it yet . " Mary laughed softly . " One boy carried a newborn lamb . " She was no longer trembling or in pain . Her memories were balm ; she wanted to comfort herself with them , and to comfort Magdalene , for these were the things she had hungered so long to hear . Mary 's last reservations were gone . She told about the strange dark Oriental princes who came riding up one day , resplendent on their camels , bearing richer gifts . She touched on the flight into Egypt , and spoke of Jesus ' boyhood , his first trip to Jerusalem , the time they thought they 'd lost him . Only once or twice did Magdalene ask questions . " And did he know who he was from the beginning , even as a child ? " " Oh , yes , I 'm sure of it . I saw it in his eyes , in many things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  his first day of school . Yes , he had to know , at least in one layer of his being . But you must understand , he was a perfectly normal child  --  very gifted , yes , but otherwise not different from his brothers . His destiny became more clear to him as he grew older . We did n't speak of it in the family , but it was clear to him and to us , his parents . Nothing must be allowed to interfere with it , nothing . Whatever the cost  --  to him or to any of us . God himself would not allow it , I realized that . Yet as his mother , I , too , bore a sacred trust . I felt I must help him , as any woman would help her son : I must strengthen him if he weakened , I must  --  " Mary 's voice broke off . " That is why , if I have seemed at times aloof  --  " An owl hooted . Animals stamped in nearby stalls . There was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never seemed anything but the precious mother of Jesus , " said Magdalene . Her voice was grave and sweet . " And there is something I must tell you , if you are n't too tired to listen . It is whyp254the main reason why I was so anxious to see you before I left for Jerusalem . Your son saved my life . Saved me from almost certain death ... By stoning , " she added as Mary gasped . " I am not a pure woman , Mary  --  at least I was not then . " " I have never judged you , Magdalene . Who am I to judge ? " " You are God 's own chosen one . You are the mother of my Lord . " With a final squeeze of Mary 's hand , Magdalene went back to her own pallet . " I was possessed of demons , many demons , " she said . " Jesus delivered me from them . Once they were out of me  --  once I was free of them , my soul was free . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know . My past  --  my very past , " she whispered desperately , flinging one hand across her brow , " added to my freedom . Only someone who has been bound as I was can know the release from this bondage . " " Are you speaking of bondage to the flesh ? " " Yes . " Magdalene turned suddenly , to prop herself upon one elbow . " You know , you must surely realize , your son is beautiful . Could the very Son of God be less than beautiful ? Many women have loved him  --  how could they help it ? For they see not only the beauty of God that shines from him , but the unutterable beauty of his face and body . And this is natural , is n't it , for did n't God make us so ? But please believe what I tell you , for I share it not out of vanity but only in the hope you will understand  --  " She could n't go on for a minute . Mary waited puzzled , heart pounding . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother , I have no special honor from God . And yet , and yet  --  I feel that I , too , have been chosen to love Jesus in a special way . A way that will protect him . Because I was freed  --  he himself freed me from all bondage to the flesh  --  I can serve and tend him . Yes , I love him , but it is not simply as a man but as the living essence of God . I worship him . I would gladly die for him . " Mary had been lying still , very still . Now she rose up and held out her arms to the woman who sat head high , her profile beautiful in the moonlight , but with tears running down her cheeks . " Dear Magdalene , " she whispered , " we must n't cry . Neither of us must cry anymore . We must trust God to protect him . Sleep now , for it is late . Sleep now . . . my daughter . " " Yes , we are both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a moment , then drew apart , drying their eyes . Magdalene crept back top255her own pallet . " Listen , " she called out then , softly into the darkness . " Cleo has been snoring for some time . " The sounds , so male and steady , were both comical and reassuring . Laughing in relief , and still clasping hands between their beds , the women closed their eyes ... . Mary slept , and dreamed . She was a young mother back in Nazareth again , and Jesus was coming home with something in his arms , a poor battered little pup . She could hear it whining and scratching at the door  --  but no , it was simply whimpering as Joseph and the children tried to set its broken leg . . . except the dog was n't their first one , Jubal , but the cruelly beaten , half-starved bigger one later  --  Benjamin , Benjy , Ben  --  who tagged Jesus to school , helped him herd the sheep , trotted along on his missions , no matter how far . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barking and scratching , demanding entrance ... . Mary awoke with a start . There was a commotion in the courtyard : a sound of barking . Angry voices . " Get away , you pariah dog ! I 'll teach you to come bothering guests ! " More barking , yelping , more voices , one of them familiar . " Wait ! Do n't drag him away ! I know this dog  --  he 's ours , he belongs to us ; he must have followed us here . Here , Ben . . . here , Ben ... " Mary sprang up , incredulous . Huddled in her cloak , she ran to the door in time to see Cleo scoop Ben up bodily , holding and rocking him like an overgrown child , trying to still his trembling . Gently scolding him , Cleo turned and saw Mary . " Go back to sleep , Mary . I 'll take him inside and tend to him . But first , if you have some of your herbs and salves with you  --  his feet are bleeding . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course ! " she cried . ' I 'll help you ! " Magdalene roused too . The three of them worked over him , as Mary 's family had done in her dream . Meanwhile , they pondered what to do . To leave Ben here was unthinkable ; he would only be abused or chased away , and it was plain he could walk no further . " We will simply have to take him along , " Cleophas decreed , stroking the now blissfully sleeping head . " He will have to ride with me , up front on the saddle . " And thus it was that the little party set off the next morning , carrying Jesus ' dog with them to Jerusalem.  |p256THE  highway on the road from Jericho was already alive withtravelers . It was too early for much shouting and singing , and the climb up through this final ridge of limestone mountains was steep . But the people were cheerful , and laughed to see the dog , nose high , riding before Cleophas on the saddle like a king . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horses , in their glisteningplumed helmets . They also smiled to see the dog , and some of them saluted . " They think we 're Romans too . " Cleo grinned , as the crowds made way . Even so , it was slow going . The roads between the soaring honeycoloredcliffs , and above the rocky gorges , were narrow . In places they could move forward only in single file . At this rate , Cleophas feared , it would be late afternoon before they reached Jerusalem . The sun was high in the sky , and they were only halfway to their destination . Finally , at a place where the highway widened , he maneuvered his mount up beside one of the soldiers to consult him . The man listened thoughtfully , nodding , then beckoned them to follow . They trotted along beside the now swarming road a little distance , then , with a rattle of stones , the puffing horses went plowing up to a wooded ridge , where the young soldier pointed toward the south . Even from here they could see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They need n't ride clear into Jerusalem to reach Bethany , he told them . Follow this path ; it was a shortcut that would lead them almost to the very door of the man they sought . " Then you know Lazarus ? " Cleo exclaimed . " Lazarus ? The one people think was raised from the dead ? Everybodyknows him , or claims to . At least , they 've heard of him and arep257trying to see him . Dying to see him , I might say , if you do n't mind the joke . " The soldier laughed doubtfully , pushed back his heavy helmetand mopped his pimpled face . The horses were leaning forward , munching at the welcome grass . Cleo studied him . " Then you do n't believe this miracle ? " The youth shrugged , glancing at the women . " Who knows ? You Jews seem to believe in miracles  --  for I see you are Jews , " he said , with a little nod of respect . " I only know you are n't the first ones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pat the neck of his sweating horse . " But you may not find Lazarus there , " he warned . " He may have fled . " " Why ? " Cleo asked . " It 's rumored your priests would prefer him dead ! " Mary spoke up . " And the one called Jesus ? " she inquired calmly , though her heart pounded sick in her breast . " The one who is said to have performed this miracle ? " " He 's the one they 're really after , of course . We 've been warned this could be the biggest Passover ever . More Jews than ever will be coming just because of him . Although they 're taking bets all over Jerusalemwhether he 'll even show up this year . Anyway , Pilate 's taking no chances . See all those soldiers ? " The youth turned in his saddle to indicate a fresh group that was overtaking the pilgrims ahead of them on the road below . " Contingents have been called up from all over Judah to keep order , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Then it 's that serious ? " " Yes , if the Jews really believe they 've finally gotten their Messiah . " " They have , " Mary heard herself say proudly . Suddenly , to her own astonishment , she was pulling the horse around to bring her face to face with the young man . " He is my son . " The youth flushed scarlet . " Forgive me , " he apologized . " I did n't mean to be rude . But if this be true , then I feel sorry for you , Madam . I will pray to my own gods to protect you . . . and your son ! " Slapping the reins , he rode off without waiting for them to thank him . But below he halted before joining the procession , turned anxiouslyin his saddle and , looking up in wonder , gave them one final salute . The path sloped downward for several miles , then gently upward through groves of olive trees , the first they had seen all morning . It was cooler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Atp258times they had to duck between the branches , all beaded with the tiny budding olives . They dismounted and walked the remaining distance , which was surprisingly short . They soon reached the hilltop and were standing in the dooryard of the handsome white house that could only be the one Jesus had described in his letter . Martha and Mary were carrying bundles across the stone terrace and piling them against the wall . They paused , shielding their eyes in their confusion , surprised at the sight of horses and the dog . Then , with glad little cries , both women came swiftly toward them , calling over their shoulders , " Lazarus , Lazarus , they 're here ! Jesus ' mother is here ! " Their brother appeared from the house and strode eagerly out to greet the visitors , embracing them , joining in the introductions and questionings . He read their anxious faces at a glance . " If only you had gotten here sooner , " he said . " Jesus left only a few hours ago , he and his men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ softly . " We urged them to stay longer , " Martha said . " They arrived only last night , and we had so little time with them . " " I 'm surprised you did n't encounter them on their way to Jerusalem , " Lazarus said . " We came by a back way , " Cleophas explained . " It saved us severalhours . " " Yes , there are a number of shortcuts . They went directly down the mountain toward Bethphage . " " Then if we hurry , perhaps we can overtake them . Were they on foot ? " Cleo asked . Lazarus nodded . " Oh , no , please do n't go just yet , " Martha was pleading . " Rest here , at least a little while . We long to know you . Jesus has told us so much about you ! Please , " she appealed to Mary . " Come inside . We have so much food ; let us serve you . " " And there 's so much to tell you about your son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What he has done for us ! Our brother  --  " she marveled . " Lazarus would n't even be here if it were n't for Jesus . " " You must forgive us . We are very grateful , " Mary said , " but we are so anxious to see him . " Yes , of course , they understood . Though it grieved the family , they agreed there was no time to waste . " But you must at least havep259a drink of cold water , " they insisted , " and some of Martha 's cakes . " Both sisters hastened into the house to get them . The dog must have some too . Half apologetically , his presence had been explained . " Ben followed us ; we had no choice but to bring him . " The dog had sprung down from his perch and was sniffing around the bundles . Cleo whistled him back . Martha knelt to feed him  --  these last of the sweets she had baked for his master . Her hands trembled . The dog 's nose was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling his silken hairs under her fingers , and gazed into the yellow , forever hungry eyes . Any creature so faithful . . . I loved him too , she thought . I , too , would have followed him anywhere . " You must come back , " Lazarus was urging , as they remounted . " To our regret , we wo n't be here . We are going to Jericho for a while , but you are welcome to stay in our home . All of you , " he said cordially , smiling at Magdalene and Cleophas . " It would be an honor . " Mary gazed at him , this attractive , vigorous , keen-eyed man her son had restored to life . Before he could continue , she asked quietly , " Are you leaving because of Jesus ? " Lazarus hesitated . " Yes , " he acknowledged . " Your son and I talked it over . He agrees it would be best , not only for him but for us . You , however , will be quite safe here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near the door . " " You 're very kind , " said Mary , " but we have other arrangements  --  myaunt does n't live far . But about Jesus  --  will he be coming here again ? " " I hope so , but I 'm not sure . " Despite the name Bethphage , which meant " city of unripe figs , " the groves of Bethphage bore richly , and their fruit was very sweet . The place was also known as the village of many donkeys , for on the adjacent farms , hundreds of these gentle beasts of burden were bred . Some families had as many as ten or twenty , kept in the fields or tied to their doors , waiting to be sold or rented for trips into Jerusalem or up through the rugged mountains . Here , too , caravans often paused to feed and rest their own animals , or to trade them for fresh ones before moving on . Unlike the sleepy surrounding villages , there was usually activityp260and sometimes excitement on its streets . And today the air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it the minutethey rode through the ancient stone gates . People were pointing , gesticulating . A little knot had gathered around an old man , who was waving his arms and crying out loudly from the doorway of his shop . " My donkeys , my donkeys ! " he was shouting . " They have taken my donkeys ! " Curious , Cleo rode as close to the huddle as he dared . The man was quite bald , but he had a long white beard , which nearly covered his chest . Lifting his arms to heaven , in his full-sleeved striped cloak , he was beating his breast and crying , " A mare and her colt that I had tied to my doorstep only this morning ! " " Who did ? " Cleo asked , bending down . He was puzzled and somehow concerned . " Two men , who were sent by the holy man . Two strapping young princes , sons of the king ! " " What holy man ? What king ? " " The one called Jesus . The one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Healing the sick , even lepers , they say , even bringing back the dead ! Our own neighbor Lazarus  --  we all know him well , do n't we ? " he asked of the crowd that was pressing nearer , growing , clamoring assent . " I was n't at the burial , worse luck , but my friend here helped carry him to the cave  --  " " It 's true , it 's true ! " the friend shouted . " And now , I tell you , Lazarus is alive ! " The old man began to wail and sway ; he was sobbing  --  whether from ecstasy or anguish was hard to tell . " And now this Jesus , the Messiah , sent two men here to claim my donkeys ! " " The Messiah ? Are you sure ? " Cleophas motioned to the women to ride closer . " Yes , only such a one could have known their perfection ! " The owner 's eyes , still streaming , were also shining . He wiped his nose with the back of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see  --  what were their names ? " He turned to consult his grandson , who was bouncing with eagerness to be of aid . " Oh , yes , Andrew and Philip . They came directly to my beasts , saying the master had sent for them . And oh , what understanding , what compassion ! For he said the colt must come along with its mother , for the little one was not yet weaned. "  |p261Cleo|phas  was frowning . " Then you 're not troubled at the loss of your beasts ? " " Troubled ? " the old man shrieked in amazement . " I am honored ! Never have I known such an honor . That a holy man , let alone the Messiah , should ask that I provide the ass on which he might ride in triumph into Jerusalem ! " " Tell me  --  how long ago did they leave ? " The old man quieted , and looked about at his audience for a moment , confused . " Half an hour , maybe more ; I ca n't be sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " A woman holding a child spoke up excitedly . " I saw them myself , the man and a group of his followers . People are cutting branches and laying them in his path . They are spreading their garments before him , like carpets on which our friend 's donkeys may walk . " " I just came from there too , " said another man , running up . " I 'm going back to join the procession as soon as I can . " " Have they started for Jerusalem yet ? " " No ; there 's a lot of singing and shouting of hosannas , but they seem to be waiting for someone . " Cleo drew a long , grateful breath . " Come , " he said to the women , as he maneuvered his horse about . To his surprise , Mary slid down from her perch . Now that they had found him , it did not seem right to greet Jesus on horseback . Her son was so tall ; she had looked up to him ever since he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him now . " Since it seems to be so close , " she told them , " I will walk . " " Oh , Mary , no ! " Magdalene pleaded . Her own fears for Jesus , her desperate desire to see him again  --  these she had suppressed throughout the journey , for his mother 's sake . She had kept silent , never intruded . But now , when they had come so far and hurried so to find him , she could keep silent no longer . " Please . Let 's get there as quickly as possible , lest we miss him ! " " He will wait , " Mary said confidently , for she knew this in her heart . " Did n't the man say they were looking for someone ? " " Magdalene 's right , Mary , " Cleo reasoned , anxiously . " Why keep them waiting longer ? " " Because I do n't think it fitting , " Mary said . " I would like to leavep262the beast here . These people are to be trusted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'm sure our possessions would be safe . " " But the gifts you are bringing Jesus , " Magdalene reminded . " The robe  --  " She caught her breath in sudden recognition . " Would n't this be the very occasion his grandmother predicted ? " Mary nodded . " Yes , I have thought of that . I will carry the robe . If Cleophas will be so kind as to untie the bundle and hand it down . " Cleo had already leapt from the saddle . He raised his arms to help Magdalene descend . It was hard to control his impatience , but anything to humor Mary . " Then we will all walk . We will leave our two horses , but lead yours with its baggage . But we must hurry to get on our way before it 's too late . " Two dark-skinned youths who had been hovering , frankly listening , sprang forward , quick as monkeys , to catch the reins Cleo tossed them . They were both grandsons of the old man whose donkeys had been chosen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horses would be tied to the very posts . The boys would guard them with their lives until the owners ' return . " Do so and you will be paid well , " Cleophas promised . . . . No , no , no , it would be an honor , for they knew that these people were somehow related to the holy man . Whinnying , with a fine jangling of harness and clopping of hooves , the mounts were led away by the nervous but exuberant boys . They were bursting with pride ; all eyes were upon them , admiring their boldness and the beauty of the steeds . A host of other boys chased after them , dancing around , keeping a safe distance , but a few were begging a turn at holding the reins . Horses were a rare charge in this village of the donkeys . Cleophas pondered the situation as he led Mary 's horse behind him into the countryside . It was nearly midafternoon . The trees , which grew thick and luxuriant beside the dusty road , cast deeper shadows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first bend , they could hear sounds of singing and shouting . Jerusalem was n't far , just across the Kidron Valley , but if this was indeed to be a triumphal procession into the crowded city , it could n't be delayed much longer . If only Mary had n't insisted on walking . Yet she was right , he realized . There was something unnatural about seeing any woman , especially a Jewish woman , on a horse . A horse was a symbol of authority and power . And for them to have come prancing throughp263this crowd on horseback , while Jesus rode an ass  --  ! Cleo shuddered . No , no , it would have been a terrible blunder ... . If only they got there in time . He was growing more agitated by the minute . If only Jesus had n't already ridden off on one of those donkeys he seemed to have commandeered . Cleo was frowning , troubledat the prospect of the coming scene . . . . True , all the prophets had ridden donkeys . And once , long ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were different now . In these modern times , kings were carried on litters , or appeared before their subjects astride a magnificentsteed . . . . Then what about the famous prophecy of Zechariah ? The words came to him suddenly , shaking him : " Behold , your king comes unto you ; he is just and having salvation , lowly and riding upon an ass , and upon a colt , the foal of an ass . " Cleo 's throat was dry ; he did n't know what to think . . . . That frenzied crowd in Bethphage , the ones overtaking them now  --  all were calling Jesus not only king but Messiah ! Even that old man who 'd provided the donkeys . . . Could it be the donkeys  --  the very sight of the donkeys that convinced them ? Was this a visual fulfillment of the prophecy they knew so well , believed in so passionately , and had waited for so long ? . . . Cleo set his teeth against the pride and concern in his breast . He did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only the pain of loving Jesus as his own son . People were appearing on the road from all directions now , ahead and behind them , running or astride their own trotting donkeys . Many were already carrying branches , others paused to scramble up the banks to wrench pine or olive branches from the trees , or boughs of the fragrant white blossoming myrtle . Others feverishly picked flowers growing along the roadside . There was the smell of bruised grass and flowers along with the tang of the new-cut branches and the acrid odor of the dusty road . Some of the people who had seen them in the village looked in surprise at these plodding strangers , who carried no tribute . Two boys raced by on their donkeys , madly waving shaggy palm leaves , and calling , " Do n't you want to see the king ? " A little way ahead , however , they halted , consulted , and trotted back , to try and share them with Mary and Magdalene . " We have plenty , from Jericho , " they explained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should have something to wave . "  | " Thank you , but we have gifts for him behind the saddle , " Mary told them , smiling . " Then you 'd better get there , " the boys advised , gesturing . Ahead of them the people were indeed disappearing ; they were among the last ones , along with a few hastening stragglers . " The robe ! " Mary remembered as the boys galloped off . She appealed to Cleophas . " Right now , before we arrive , should n't we get it down and have it ready for him ? " Cleophas groaned inwardly . Again she was right . There would be no time later ; and on this occasion , if ever , Jesus must have his new robe . He reached up quickly to bring the heavy bundle down . But even as Mary 's trembling fingers undid the straps and , brought the garment forth , Cleo suddenly groaned aloud . The distant barking of a dog reminded him  --  for the first time he missed Ben . " Benjy ! Where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked about . He must have jumped down when they stopped in Bethphage ; in all the commotion they had n't noticed . But they dared not even consider going back for him . " If he found us before , he will find us again , " Cleophas tried to reassure the women . " Or he will wait for us there with the horses . " Mary was shaking out the beautiful garment . Magdalene helped her smooth it and hold it higher , that it might not touch the ground . Both caught their breaths , relieved . Though Mary had taken it out each night and hung it over a chair , they were afraid it might be wrinkled . But the lovely fabric was smooth as cream to their fingers , its delicate filigree of blue and rose and silver glistening in the afternoon sun . Together they folded it carefully for Mary to hold in her arms , against her breast like a child . Cleophas , too , was pleased and proud . But there was no time to waste . " Do you need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of urgency . " If not , I 'll put this back . " He began to fasten the bag , which was heavy with Mary 's things and other gifts . They had proceeded a few paces when Magdalene cried out , " Wait , wait , the girdle  --  we forgot the girdle ! " And he must pull the bag down once more , for the women to rummage through it for the splendid blue satin sash Cleo himself had chosen , with its semipreciousstones . Jesus would never wear real gems , Cleo knew , yet itp265was a stunning adornment , and it thrilled him to see it now . Magdalenewould carry it . The shady road sloped down between the green hills . They hurriedalong , hearts pounding from the pace , but glad to hear the music and shouting still rising , even louder from the hollow below , where a throng of excited people swarmed about , clutching their palms , or boughs from the flowering trees . They were laughing and singing , elated , waving to each other , or throwing down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ music and the psalms . There was the shrill , sweet sound of pipes and flutes , the clashing and flashingof cymbals . On the sunny pasture hillside a circle of girls had clasped hands and were skipping about in a spontaneous little dance ; small boys were turning somersaults or rolling ecstatically on the grass . Other people perched patiently on rocks , or the embankment beside a sparkling stream . On the road , at the center of this welter of color and commotion , they glimpsed two white donkeys , a mother and her colt . Both were draped in scarlet shawls , and as they watched , a woman scurried forth to fasten wild roses to their bridles . Two others , a man and a woman , ran down the road a little way ahead to spread garments in their path . The apostles seemed to be milling about , anxious to start , but the three could n't see Jesus at first , for he was surrounded . Then the crowds parted , and they caught a glimpse of Jesus , kneeling . And they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dog barking , and coming closer , they saw that Jesus was hugging him , while Ben frantically tried to lick his face . Jesus stood up then , laughing and crying as Benjy lunged at him joyfully again and again . The dog spied them then and came galloping to meet them . Jesus followed , tears still wet on his cheeks as he made his way to them through the excited people , who were dazzled anew at sight of the horse Cleo was leading . Murmuring endearments , Jesus kissed and held each one , while the dog waited , tail wagging in triumph . " I knew you were coming , " Jesus said with emotion . " It 's late ; we must go , but I could n't bear to leave without first seeing you . " Several of his followers also hastened up to greet them : Peter , Dunes and John , eager to begin the triumphal procession , but happy to see them , and full of questions . Where would they stay ? Had they encountered Adah or Salome on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from his wife , but he felt sure she and some of the other women were coming . Yes , Magdalene told them , the women might already be in Jerusalem . The conversation was interrupted by Judas , who rushed up on his long , officious stride . " Master , we dare not wait any longer , " he warned . " The people are getting impatient . We must not let their enthusiasm wane . " " That 's right , " said Peter . He mopped his big ruddy face , proud but concerned . " Word has gone on ahead , they say people are lining up for miles . " The din of voices increased even as he spoke . " We must start soon if we are n't to disappoint them . " Mary stood hugging the robe . " Yes , you must n't keep them waiting , " she said to Jesus , eyes shining . " But you ca n't go without this ! It 's a gift from your grandmother , " she explained , unfolding it , with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it from brushing the ground . " Hannah had it made for you  --  the best she could order from Cleo and his father . She says to tell you she would have made it herself , but her fingers are too stiff to sew now . " " On , no ! " Jesus protested , with a little moan . " She ca n't afford it  --  she should n't have done such a thing . " " Thank Cleo , " Mary said , glancing toward him gratefully . " He knows how much such things matter to Hannah . And she 's right ! " Mary thrust the robe upon Jesus , wanting to weep at the one he was wearing . It was not only old and threadbare , but soiled where the dog had jumped on him . " You ca n't ride into Jerusalem looking like that . Put this on , " Mary ordered her son . " Hurry ! Now  --  right now ; never mind the audience . Take off that old thing , " she insisted , " and give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She reached out to help him , and there before his men and his frenzied admirers , who were laughing and shouting with delight , Jesusobeyed . He unfastened his old familiar garment and handed it to her , while swiftly , expertly , Cleophas wrapped the splendid new one around him . Magdalene , watching , caught her breath . The robe became him ; never had she seen him so beautiful  --  his sun-dark cheeks so pink , his eyes so bright , his lips so red . At the last minute she remembered the girdle , and stepped forward to present it to him , and he fastened it around his waist , its gems dazzling in the sun.  | " If only your grandmother could see you , " she said , her rich voice throbbing . " She is so proud of you . We were there , your mother and I , when she first saw the robe . It is a garment fit for a king ! " " Our king , our king , let us follow our king ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to our king ! " Judas , who had witnessed the whole performance , grasped Cleophasby the arm and drew him aside . He had noticed the horse , now tied to a tree by the roadside , cropping grass . He also recognized Cleophas as the wealthy family friend he 'd heard about . " My name is Judas , son of Simon Iscariot , " he introduced himself , and kissed Cleophason both cheeks as an equal . " Forgive my haste , but I must speak to you . Surely you must feel as I do  --  " Lowering his voice , Judas jerked his head toward the sleepily waiting donkeys . " A man like Jesus can scarcely command much respect in Jerusalem if he rides in on the back of a common ass . " " Our king , our king ! " The chant was growing louder . " These people do n't mind , " Judas patronized , rushing on . " They 're common people . But I do , and I 'm sure you do . Jesus needs the attention of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Cleo drew back , trying to conceal his distaste for this presumptuousman . " What are you trying to tell me ? " " Jesus is dressed like a king , he should make his entrance like a king , riding a fine steed like yours . " Cleophas gave a brusque laugh . The sheer effrontery ! " You seem to have forgotten the prophecy every schoolboy knows : When the Messiah comes , he will choose to ride to victory on the back of an ass ! " Judas ' face darkened . The words stung . He could feel his scar twitching in his embarrassment . " I still think I 'm right , " he declared , as coolly as possible . But his anger was evident as he stalked off . Andrew and Philip were already leading the donkeys up to Jesus , who stood in conversation with his mother and Magdalene . " Do n't try to follow , " Jesus was telling them . " I can see you are very tired . ( ; o back to Bethany and rest . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mary told him . " I 'm anxious to he with Elizabeth . " " Yes , go there , she needs you , " Jesus said . " I will come to see you there . " " And you ? "  | " We will stay in Bethany most nights . It 's the best place for my men . Do n't worry ; I will be with you every moment I can . " As he spoke he was stroking the nose of the colt . It was uneasy , for it had never been ridden , and the dog sniffing around added to its nervousness . Hooves rattled the stones as the colt shied , striving to nuzzle its mother . With his hands and his voice Jesus gentled them both . " Hush now , be still ; there is nothing to fear , " he murmured . " You must go now , Ben . " He knelt to hug the hot , quivering body once more . " No , no , you ca n't come with as . Go to Mary . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the collar of the whimpering , straining dog . " You must start , " she told Jesus . " We have already detained you too long . You will ride before the people in glory , as the prophet Zechariah proclaimed . Do n't worry about us . We will wait for you in Ein Karem . " " Hosanna , hosanna ! " The shouts grew louder as the donkeys began to move . For seeing him thus , attired in radiance , with the gems like a rainbow at his waist , the people intensified their fervor . " Hail to the son of David , praise him ! Blessed be the one who comes in the name of the Lord ! " Mothers held up their little ones to behold him . Some ran forward to kiss his sandals or the hem of his sparkling white robe . Frantic to demonstrate their loyalty and love , they waved their branches and pelted him with flowers . For was this not the man said to be the Messiah ? Here on their very roads ! He could multiply fish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a story he had even walked on water . Those who traveled with him , and many who had witnessed this at the Temple , vowed he could heal every manner of sickness , even leprosy and blindness . Above all , just up the hill in Bethany , he had brought a man back from the dead ! Nothing was impossible to him . . . . They were laughing and crying . God had sent him to them at last  --  the one who could drive out the accursed Romans , solve all their problems , become their king ! Ben was panting , frantic to follow , his eyes beseeching . Mary had to kneel down and lock her arms around his neck to hold him . She could smell his hot breath , and the tang of the horse , which was tied again and munching the fragrant grass . Butterflies dipped about , circlinglike dancers . The sky was very blue , with a few white cloudsp269drifting . And as the crowds moved farther away , she could hear the birds singing in the trees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was aware of Cleophas and Magdalene behind her . Cleo put a hand on her shoulder . Magdalene was shielding her eyes , still waving , in case Jesus should turn . Mary freed a hand to wave too . She knew he could n't see them , of course ; there were too many people , still singing and shouting and playing their pipes , the sounds growing fainter . The dog had started to bark again ; he did n't stop barking until the procession was out of sight.  |p270SEE  how they love him ! " Mary cried softly , as the sounds of the cheering died away . " All those people  --  and there must be thousandsmore in Jerusalem . I wish now we 'd followed . " " That would have been difficult , " said Magdalene gently , " with the horses and the dog . " " And you 're so tired , " Cleo said , patting the beast which they insisted Mary ride back to Bethphage . He exchanged concerned glances with Magdalene . They could see Mary was exhausted , fatigued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saddle : the soldier 's warning this morning , the fear of missing Jesus , even the thrill of finding him , there in all the commotion and frenzy of his admirers . Cleo held out his arms to Mary . " Come , let me lift you up . And when we get to the village , perhaps we should try to find rooms for the night . " " On , no , please , " Mary protested . " Ein Karem is n't much farther  --  it'sin the valley only a few miles down the road . I 'm anxious to see Elizabeth . She must be so worried ; I want to put her mind at rest . " Again Magdalene and Cleo regarded each other , troubled . But they said nothing , trudging along beside her , with the hosannas still echoing in their heads . Not until Cleo had reclaimed their horses from the boys ( reluctant to part with their charges , but ecstatic at his reward ) and the two were riding together a little way ahead did he mutter his apprehensions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 's right , but I fear the consequences of all this . I do n't think this ride will accomplish what she dreams . "  |p271Magdalene  nodded . " It ca n't , " she moaned softly . " If only it could . Like his mother , I 'm so proud of Jesus . But the priests wo n't like it . And I know how cruel those priests can be . " " Do you think I should warn Mary ? " " Not just yet . She 's wise and brave . She 'll soon realize . Let her be happy as long as she can . " Mary felt their solicitude . It was in their faces as they waited for her to catch up with them , in their voices asking directions . The road wound down into the beautiful terraced valley that cradled the village of Ein Karem . Its name meant " spring of the vineyard , " Mary remembered , for a spring bubbled at its entrance , and the surrounding hills were rich in grapes and olive groves . " Straight ahead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fixed smile as they drew near . " Then the left fork in the road and halfway up the hill . . . See  --  that beautiful pink stone house with the many steps leading to it . And all those beautiful flowers . My aunt loves flowers ! " She was speaking excitedly , trying to sort out her emotions . For the hope , the desperate hope , had begun to wane . In its place was only this blind frantic joy at the prospect of seeing Elizabeth again . As it had been when she was only a girl , newly and mysteriously pregnant , fleeing to her aunt . . . as it had been when their sons were twelve years old . . . as it had been so many times since  --  at least until the death of Joseph . . . so it was now . Everything would be all right once she was safely with Elizabeth . No harm would come to Jesus  --  not yet , not yet ! And perhaps even , dear God , never . " We will have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spring . There is a cave there , and sometimes a stableboy . " That would n't be necessary , Cleo said ; he would take them with him . " I 'm going on into the city as soon as we know you 're safe . " He had friends to stay with there , and business to attend to . " But you 'll come back ? " " Yes . I 'll keep you both informed . " Magdalene thought it best to go on too . She wanted to join Salomeand the other women . " I know where they 're staying ; they will beexpecting me . And , Mary , you and your aunt will want to be alone . " " Come with me , at least to meet her , " Mary pleaded , catchingMagdalene 's hand . For suddenly she realized she was not prepared to face Elizabeth , after all : Have I forgotten my aunt 's own agony ,  |p272such  a little while ago ? What will I say to her ? How dare I come to her , either to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for him ? How can I expect her to comfort and guide me , after what she has gone through ? Even as Mary hesitated , a woman rose up from the flowers , and shielding her puzzled eyes for a minute , came slowly down to them . " Elizabeth ! " Mary cried out , shocked . For the aunt , whose step had once been so brisk but graceful , came gingerly , feeling her way . Pain had cruelly carved the tall , rich , almost sensuous body , whittling it until it was now almost the size of her sister Hannah 's . The hair , once so black and stunning with its silver stripes , was still abundant but had turned snow-white . There was only a hint of her dimples in the sunken cheeks . Those great expressive eyes sparkled now at sight of Mary , but they , too , were deeply sunken . It was almost like greeting a strange , somewhat prettier Hannah . And when Mary held her aunt 's thin , trembling body , Elizabeth clutched her as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wordlessly for a second , making no sound . Then , with her old composure , Elizabeth drew back , smiled , and stretched out her hands to greet the others . Mary forced a smile as she and Elizabeth walked through the big empty house . Like her aunt , it had changed . There was an unfamiliar spareness about it , Mary realized , startled . Their feet echoed on the cold marble of the once richly carpeted floors . Things seemed to be missing . Where was that beautiful chest that had always stood by the entrance ? The first thing she always noticed and admired  --  that chest with the huge branched golden candlesticks on it . Where were the mirrors , the delicate chairs and silken couches ? Soft draperies still blew at the tall arched windows , and the vases still held flowers , but the sense of opulence was gone . It was as if the winds of grief and terror had assaulted even Elizabeth 's home , wrenching it , peeling away its very flesh as it had hers , stripping it down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her throat arched ; she , too , was trying to smile , but her fingers bit into Mary 's arm , and her voice , which was still rich and sweet , shook . " I promised myself , ' I will not break downp273before Mary , ' " she scolded lightly . " ' I know she will come again , and when she does I will be brave . ' " " That 's just what I was telling myself all the way here ! " Mary cried . " I will not weep , I will not weep , I will not burden my precious aunt  --  " " I knew you would come when you could . Especially now , at this Passover , for you must have heard what is happening here in Jerusalem . " They had reached the rooftop and stood by the rough stone parapet , leaning on it as they so often had , looking toward the city . " But I wondered what I could say or do to help you . " Elizabeth turned to Mary , bewildered . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ! " Mary cried out in anguish , throwing her arms around her . " Forgive me for waiting so long . I wanted to rush to you the minute we heard about John . " For a minute they held each other in a fierce desperation , while tears ran down their cheeks . Then , blinking rapidly , Elizabeth wiped her eyes and drew away . " That would have been a mistake , " she said , in her old pleasantly decisive way . " Come , let us sit down . We must talk . And we must be honest with each other . It would be foolish and false to pretend , I see that now . Only in being honest can we draw courage from each other . " " You were always my source of hope and courage . Today , coming here , though I resolved not to burden you , I was also selfish , I could think of little else . " " It 's good that you did n't come before , " Elizabeth went on . " Your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's what Cleo insisted , " Mary explained anxiously . " And so did Jesus ' brothers . They thought we must try to find him and bring him home . " " They were right . His life , too , was in danger . " Elizabeth halted , one hand pressed to her mouth . Yet she must say it . " As  --  oh , Mary , I do n't mean to frighten you , but . . . it may well be now . " " I have to face that , " Mary said calmly . " It 's why I came . Why I dropped everything to get here , rode day and night , actually rode a horse ! " She managed a wry little laugh . " Me , a decent Jewish woman . And I must tell you , my backside is very sore . " It was good to hear Elizabeth laugh too , softly , throatily , in the old way . And as Mary spoke , her own spirits rose.         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
