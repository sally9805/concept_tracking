" I kept saying , ' Get your tickets for next season , boys , ' " Hedberg recalled . " We play them eight times next season , and it ' s going to be twice as good. " // The Swedish-born Ranger was grasping the possibilities presented by geographical realignment , in which intra-division opponents will meet eight times instead of four . His vision has arrived months ahead of time , however , as the New York rivals will meet at least four more times starting tonight in the semifinals of the Stanley Cup playoffs. // A team from the suburbs against a team from the city . The champions against the challengers . Even though most of the players were born in Canada or Sweden , to the fans this is a New York rivalry , the way it used to be in baseball. // In case you were born yesterday or moved to New York from the nether regions of the Steinberg cartoon ( in which Fifth Avenue is the center of the universe , and New Jersey blurs into California ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three baseball teams. // The Brooklyn Dodgers and the New York Giants staged a holy war via the subway 22 times a season . Once they even staged a three-game National League playoff , and sometimes one of them would play the New York Yankees in the World Series. // It was a time of fierce passion , nothing like the rather bland coexistence of the Yankees and the Mets today . There was no such thing as an ordinary Dodger-Giant game , even in seasons when neither team was going anywhere. // One Brooklyn Dodger fan can still recall being escorted to the Polo Grounds , circa 1948 , by two men who were like his uncles , Jim and Joe McGuinness . For years afterward , he would have to endure their nonetoo-subtle teasing about the chintzy home run that allowed the Giants to beat the Dodgers. // The proximity-bred stereotypes and prejudices : All Giant fans smoked cigars and talked big when their team got lucky . Yankee fans were humorless and demanding of their grim Bombers , who played in a Wagnerian cathedral . Dodger fans were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // Now it is time for Ranger fans and Islander fans to sense each other from close range , as the two teams grapple with hands on each other ' s throats . What are the subjective differences between the two teams ? // To begin with , the Islanders are the reigning champions - a team of great ability and precision , put together by Bill Torrey and Al Arbour . With battling Billy Smith , sensitive Mike Bossy , cool-eyed Bryan Trottier and suave Denis Potvin , the Islanders are second only to the Yankees among New York teams in skill and charisma. // But are the Islanders really a New York team ? The players sometimes talk about not receiving respect around the league , even after their Stanley Cup title last year . They do not feel the tribute in the news media and arenas and streets and hotel lobbies that a championship team should receive , that the Canadiens and the Flyers still receive. // Part of this perceived neglect may stem from the Islanders ' home base , a suburban arena in Uniondale , L.I. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of most New Yorkers. // Long Island is a collection of villages , hamlets , unincorporated areas , school districts , sewer districts , water districts - hundreds of tiny pockets with no center . Most New Yorkers think of Long Island as an interminable stretch of expressway , or as railroads that must be endured to get to Jones Beach or the Hamptons or the Fire Island ferry. // In most important ways , Long Island is a good place for a hockey player or anybody else to live ( although Glenn Resch knew it was time to move back to Minnesota when his 10-year-old daughter came home from school cussing like a drill instructor and saying " everybody does it " ) . // Among the Islanders , only Denis Potvin seems attracted to the big city shimmering west of the subdivisions . He has been known to spend entire days taking photographs of city roofs , sampling restaurants and chatting with strangers who may not even know he plays defense for a living. // Most of the Islanders live in comfortable private homes on the North Shore , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Manitoba or Quebec . They drive to work at a circular arena , with no character , no gathering places , with only a cold northwest wind blowing across the open tundra. // The ambiance at Nassau Coliseum is closer to Moose Jaw than to Manhattan - work boots and jeans and flannel shirts are virtually required for admission . Islander fans drink beer and make noise but do not say funny things . In some subtle way , the Islanders may be deprived of the glamour of a championship by playing in the ' burbs . Or it may not make any difference. // Sonny Werblin thought it made a difference . When he became boss man of the Rangers , he blanched at the idea of New York players ' living and practicing in Long Beach , L.I. A showman who knows the importance of image , Werblin fretted until the team switched its practice site to Rye , N.Y. So now many of the Rangers , both bachelors and family men , live in Westchester County. // Westchester is still the ' burbs . The Rangers are unmistakably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retire somebody important , they do so in the East 50 ' s , with limousines parked outside and gathering crowds asking , " Hey , what ' s going on ? " // Circular and disjointed , the new Madison Square Garden is not nearly so electric as the old Garden , with its central marquee on Eighth Avenue , but at least the fans come to the games with a sense of community. // Just to get to their seats , they have to brave the disintegrating subways and hack their way past the scalpers , the pot sellers , the derelicts , the pretzel salesmen and a few lost souls who haven ' t gone home since the last Grateful Dead concert. // Like their fans , the Rangers are survivors , having gone through the last hazy days of Fred Shero , the phasing out of Phil Esposito and recent serious injuries to Walt Tkaczuk and Dave Maloney , to come alive in the last month under Craig Patrick. // The team from the city has new confidence , the team from the suburbs has a maturity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stanley Cup ; Ranger fans have long memories of failure . While the fans argue , the opening puck is dropped. //
