The corridors of the neoclassical House of Trade Unions building were dark when Boris Yeltsin , 58 , Moscow 's former Communist Party leader , emerged from a conference room to speak to journalists and admirers waiting in the hall . Yeltsin looked weary but triumphant . " Boris Nikolayevich ! How does it feel ? " shouted a foreign reporter . " All of Moscow will vote ! " Yeltsin beamed . " Can you imagine what that means ? " <P> Only minutes earlier , 886 electors had cast ballots approving Yeltsin 's candidacy for city-wide representative to the Congress of People 's Deputies , a recently created legislature that Mikhail Gorbachev is counting on to boost his floundering reform drive . Yeltsin 's success was a signal turnabout . Sixteen months ago , Gorbachev ousted the Moscow party boss after he passionately attacked the slow pace of Soviet reform . Last week Yeltsin overcame that taint as one of two candidates to survive the emotional twelve- hour meeting called to decide how many of ten proposed candidates would appear on the ballot for Moscow 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Union 's first real electoral campaign , in which several candidates will be able to vie for the same seat , entered its final phase . <P> Across the country , lists of candidates were approved after weeks of often stormy preliminary meetings . The sessions became controversial because they included only specially chosen local voters with the power to eliminate candidates before the March 26 vote .

Two weeks ago , Andrei Sakharov withdrew his candidacy by publishing a short announcement in a Moscow newspaper saying he would run only as a representative of the Academy of Sciences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> In the Ukrainian Republic it appeared that at least 40 of 175 districts would have only one candidate on the ballot . Gorbachev made a hasty trip to the region , where he exhorted citizens and party officials to make better use of their democratic rights . Speaking to a group of coal miners in Donetsk , the Soviet leader warned that his reform program needed the Ukraine 's support . Said he : " If every republic does n't make its contribution , then of course perestroika will slip into neutral . " <P> Many Soviet citizens needed no urging to take advantage of their new democratic prerogatives , and some were already champing to go further . Candidate Yeltsin , for one , called for an open discussion of the possibility of introducing a multiparty system before the next Soviet election . Seated in a hall beneath a banner that proclaimed THE ELECTION OF U.S.S.R. PEOPLE 'S DEPUTIES IS A SCHOOL FOR DEMOCRACY , nuclear scientist Yasen Shevelev , 63 , marveled at the change in political climate . Said he : " It 's hard to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
