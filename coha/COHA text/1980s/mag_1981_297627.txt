Three new books tell all about Liz , Dick and Eddie <P> Where would gossip be without Elizabeth Taylor ? Barely breathing , obviously . Probably no one in the past 30 years has provided better copy or set more tongues wagging . Now , by a curious coincidence , three books have just been published that should give her a permanent place in the Gossip Hall of Fame . The first , Kitty Kelley 's Elizabeth Taylor is about the lady herself . The second , Eddie : My Life , My Loves is the autobiography of her fourth husband , Eddie Fisher . The third , Paul Ferris ' Richard Burton , is a biography of her fifth and sixth husband . But all are really , at least in the good parts , about Liz . <P> Kitty Kelley subtitles her book The Last Star , but she might just as well have said The Last Vamp . Taylor probably is the end of a line that stretches back to Clara Bow : flamboyant , outsize and so self-absorbed and utterly beautiful that anyone who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by force of gravity . As Fisher puts it somewhat less kindly , " Elizabeth liked to collect trophies . " <P> Fisher , the teen-age singing crush of the ' 50s , was of course one of her trophies-though it is hard to fathom why she bothered . But bother she did . Half the nation professed to be outraged when Fisher left sweet , unaffected Debbie Reynolds for the widow of his best friend , Mike Todd . Or was that a case of several mistaken identities ? Reynolds , says Fisher , was neither sweet nor unaffected , and he had been unhappy with her almost from the beginning . He soon discovered that life with Liz , however , was an adventure for which he was unprepared : " Children , pets , servants , minor problems transformed into major tragedies , confusion , chaos , everything at fever pitch . . . Living with her was like living with a hurricane ; each storm built in intensity , then subsided into an eerie calm as the eye passed , only to begin all over again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was seeking other trophies , according to Kelley 's complete but rather mean-spirited account ( Simon &; Schuster ; $14.95 ) . Perhaps the oddest head on Taylor 's wall is that of Columnist Max Lerner . A professor of American civilization at Brandeis University and the distinguished author of numerous heavy tomes , Lerner was 57 when they began their romance . He was clearly nattered out of his Ph.D.s by finding that he was attractive to a creature like Taylor- " She said I was her intellectual Mike Todd , " he brags to Kelley-and the most amusing part of all three books is listening to Lerner burble on and on and on about things that civilized men are supposed to keep to themselves . Perhaps the second greatest amusement is Fisher 's apparently straight-faced comment : " The attention of a man like Lerner , a renowned intellectual , was proof that she had a brain .
