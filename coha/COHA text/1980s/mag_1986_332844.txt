It was all there but the heart-pounding , thum-pa , thum-pa music . Last week a Long Island shark fisherman who served as the model for the grizzled Quint in Jaws helped a young charter-boat captain land the largest great white shark ever taken on a sporting rod and reel . Frank Mundus , 60 , and Donnie Braddick , 30 , had spotted a group of great whites feeding on the carcass of a whale about 25 miles south of Montauk , N.Y. , and mobilized for battle . But the monster did not immediately abandon the whale in favor of the crew 's whiting , and butterfish bait . " We were offering him a lollipop when he had the whole candy store , " says Mundus . He turned the task of landing the shark over to Braddick because " I ai n't no spring chicken " ; after a two-hour struggle , the fish gave up . The next day thousands of locals and tourists crowded the Montauk marina to see the shark , which weighed 3,450 lbs. , 800 lbs . heavier than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1959 . Braddick 's brute may not qualify for the record books , however . The 150- lb. test line he used exceeds the allowed strength .
