Turnaround by Don Carpenter ( Simon &; Schuster , 253 pp. , $13.95 ) If Turnaround were a script , it would by now have gone into turnaround ? meaning that the studio which financed it would have given up and declared itself willing to be bought out . For Don Carpenter has written the proverbial great Hollywood novel ? and no one noticed . Simon &; Schuster dumped Turnaround ' on the market early this summer withoverclassification in his careful out efforts to advertise or distribute it , and despite warm words from reviewers and fellow writers , the book could not be found in bookstores by the end of July . The problem with the great Hollywood novel is that it too is a Hollywood clich ? . All these years we 've been waiting to celebrate a book that would really show what bastards the bastards are ; then we get such books and find them flat and predictable . The snotty among us have written that reality is no longer real ; only surreal effects like Nathanael West 's can capture the vulgarly exaggerated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Lout because it has more heart and less slop . And it knows more , it has more to tell us , because it is written with unassuming precision of detail . D ESPITE A FEW errors and improbabilities , one could learn from Turnaround how scripts get written , how movies get started , and the relation between the two . But more than that , Turnaround is written with love , not just of Hollywood , but of life and people as they are found there . If there is no dignity in the perpetual fight against turnaround , at least there is stupendous ingenuity . Show biz itself is a special kind of lie seeking against big odds to become truth and it is in that seeking that Don Carpenter finds the high glee that animates his novel . Carpenter does n't glorify evil , but neither does he inflate thievery and exploitation into the end of Western civilization . We can see , from what he tells us , how bad movies are , and we are free to think what that means about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carpenter 's subject . His subject is the efforts of characters on various rungs of the ladder to hang on , or climb higher , or step on someone else 's hands ? all of which he sees as human and worth recording . The characters and what they do are believable , not merely symptomatic . On every page we can cackle with the author ( as he is shown in his jacket photo cackling ) ? yes , this is just what would happen , just how so-and-so would behave ? and yes , even as the characters transcend our expectations and surprise us , yes , this is just how it has to be . Carpenter 's L.A. is , in its way , like the Paris of Balzac , where the scurrying is so intricate and the scheming so rich and hopeful that it is raised to the level of nobility . And of course it is corrupt . Any second-rater could tell us that ; Hollywood itself can display its corruption like a burlesque dancer revealing her ass . But it takes a novelist to show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our sympathetic attention . Carpenter 's story is told strictly from the viewpoints of its three heroes . The naive hero is a young screenwriter , Jerry Rexford , who lives on the seamy side of town , the " B " Hollywood Carpenter knows so well . Hollywood for Rexford is a donut shop , a row of bookstores , a semicircle of furnished apartments around a pool he is embarrassed to use , and his job at Pet Care Hotline . Rexford gets involved with a woman he meets at an office party who turns out to be witty , kind , and loving . But as he learns his trade and begins to sell his work , he has to write on the sly , For fear of upsetting her . She thinks Jerry 's work is a foolish dream ? and that one conflict ruins everything else between them . For Jerry is a man who is truly devoted to his dubious craft . Among Jerry 's friends is a man who clerks at a porno shop , who tells Jerry he will help him " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because you know rue ! " After Jerry 's failed efforts to send scripts through agents , it is indeed the porno clerk who produces the breakthrough contact , via a chain of odd contacts leading to the young hotshot producer , Rick Heidelberg . When Rick glances at Jerry 's script , he sees at once it is something he can use . And that is just how an unknown would get started ? not through the connections he thinks he has to have , but through dumb luck that can never be anticipated . Rick Heidelberg , the creator of that smash hit , The Endless Unicorn , is all calculation as he sets about the manipulations that will jockey him into his second hit or leave him out in the cold . Yet the quality of Rick 's thinking , as Carpenter shows it , is original and creative ? never mind that it is self-centered and sometimes silly . Carpenter catches the alertness and the appetite for taking chances , the precise skill at social measurement unknown to better men with fixed inner standards . Heidelberg 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ major studio , Alexander Hellstrom , a man of 50 who is preoccupied throughout the novel with a rich and stylish lady who Fools him so badly that he is the last to see she is incorrigibly promiscuous . His chauffeur knew it from the beginning . Carpenter has a way of telling us about it that makes it seem neither cliched nor offensive , but an attribute of a particular woman belonging to a particular wealthy set . There is an interesting moment when Hellstrom discovers his ladylove in bed with Heidelberg and Heidelberg 's girlfriend . Hells trom 's first reaction is rage . He covers himself , however , holds it against no one , and actually helps Heidelberg make his new picture . It is later on that he experiences a crisis : It was something inside himself that really ate away at him ... and made him , for almost the first time in his life , wonder what kind of human being he was . The only words he could find for it were moral rutrage . The three of them lying there wet and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had had a sword he would have put them to death on the spot . Who the hell Al fir think he vas ? The question of course is Hellstrom 's own , and it defines a great deal about the man and the world he lives in , good , bad , and otherwise . Carpenter 's rule is that the novelist never comments . He never has to . CARPENTER ? who had already written Hard Rain Falling and Blade of Light gotinvolved in movies in the late 1960s , when he took his first script and managed to co-produce a fine , tough , little-known film , Payday . After that Carpenter went through 12 years in which he never got another script produced . It 's noteworthy that in Turnaround , after introducing several dubious movie ideas , Carpenter allows Jerry Rexford to come up with two original gems . The fact that Carpenter serves them up in a novel is an indication not only of his allegiance but of the fate his best ideas would meet if they had to survive in the movie-making process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down by egos whose extramovie needs they failed to fulfill , Carpenter began to write L.A. show-biz novels ? Jody McKeegam and A Couple of Comedians ? in which he mixed a geography of power with scenes from the down side of town , the region of the talents and semitalents who mill about the entrances , pushing to get in , yet capable of a touching empathy in their relations with one another . At first Carpenter was less sure of himself dealing with big shots than he was with the downtrodden . Turnaround achieves more completely what he has been trying to do right along : to show the Balzacian comedy of the parts interacting , of the rise from the bottom and the dip from the top .
