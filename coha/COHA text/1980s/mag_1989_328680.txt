For weeks he had been living in the tranquil priory of Saint-Francois in Nice . Then one morning last week , police swooped down and arrested Paul Touvier , 74 , the intelligence chief of the Lyons militia during the Nazi Occupation . Twice after World War II , Touvier was sentenced to death for collaborating with the Nazis and torturing and executing French Resistance members . He escaped and stayed hidden until the statute of limitations expired in 1967 . In 1971 Touvier received a presidential pardon . Two years later Touvier was charged again , this time with crimes against humanity , to which the statute does not apply . Again he escaped . <P> The Touvier case has raised embarrassing questions . Police followed his trail through several Catholic monasteries . Saint-Francois is run by right- wing followers of Monsignor Marcel Lefebvre , the schismatic bishop excommunicated last year . Asked Richard Wertenschlag , Grand Rabbi of Lyons : " How could ecclesiastical institutions give cover to one who committed crimes against humanity ? "           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
