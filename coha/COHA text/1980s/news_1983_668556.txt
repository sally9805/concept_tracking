For 309 consecutive National Hockey League games , Mike O ' Connell had skated through a gauntlet of opponents with mayhem in their hearts . He had emerged unscathed . Before the Bruins ' final exhibition game this season , O ' Connell was doing nothing more dangerous than getting dressed , which is not usually considered a contact sport . He emerged on a stretcher . " I had put my left skate on and I was ready to lace up my right skate , " recalls O ' Connell . " I reached down to get it . All of a sudden , I felt this pain in my back . It felt like there was a hole in it . " The pain was as frightening as it was foreign . While his teammates were busy wrapping up their preseason obligations against the Quebec Nordiques , O ' Connell remained in the locker room , flat on his back but riding a roller- coaster in his head . " I was scared for the whole night , " says O ' Connell . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ didn ' t know what it was . " He was greatly relieved to find out what it wasn ' t . When the Bruins returned from Quebec City after the game , O ' Connell was taken to Massachusetts General Hospital , where X-rays revealed that no severe damage had been done to his back . It turned out that the injury was a sprained ligament , the prescription was rest and the recuperation period was about 10 days . O ' Connell was back at practice three days after suffering the injury , and he is expected to make his belated regular-season debut Thursday night when the Bruins meet the Montreal Canadiens at the Garden . " It feels better every day , " he says . Because he was sidelined for the first three games of the season , O ' Connell reluctantly made history of a sort . He hadn ' t been marked absentfrom a regular-season lineup since Dec. 9 , 1979 . And he had never missed a game as a Bruin - a stretch of 208 official workdays since he was acquiredfrom the Chicago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Connell ' s return will be particularly welcomed because he provides the Boston defense with a lot more than a familiar face . " When he takes the puck and goes with it , " says Bruins coach Gerry Cheevers , " he ' s as good as anyone in the league . " Indeed , the 27-year-old Cohasset native always has been a heady , steady player , with no soft spots either in his style or his approach . Last year , his fifth in the NHL , he blossomed as an assertive force at both ends of the ice . " It ' s experience , " says O ' Connell . " Every year you get more experienced and you feel you can do more things . " Enthusiasm helps , too . Whether it ' s a monotonous workout or a momentous playoff , O ' Connell wants to be there . He thinks the term " optional " applies to auto equipment , not hockey practices . " You can see how much he enjoys the game , " says Cheevers . It seems only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Connell - inactivity . He says of the back injury that ended his streak , " I shouldn ' t be penalized for all those games . "
