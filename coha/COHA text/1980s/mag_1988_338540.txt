With their swept-back wings , forward-mounted canards , or stabilizers , and pusher propellers , they look a little as if they should be moving through the air tailfirst . But the two new designs  --  Beech Aircraft 's Starship and Rinaldo Piaggio 's P. 180 Avanti  --  are very much forward-looking pieces of machinery . Using advanced technology to deliver high performance and good fuel efficiency , they could dictate the shape of small transport aircraft in the coming years . <P> Last week the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration announced that Beech , based in Wichita , had met Government standards for airworthiness with its Starship , and granted " type certification , " clearing the way for deliveries to customers by next spring . Piaggio , which has headquarters in Genoa , Italy , hopes to receive U.S. certification for its Avanti model by the end of the year . Both planes , each seating seven to ten passengers , are expected to be warmly welcomed in the corporate market . Says Henry Ogrodzinski , communications director of the General Aviation Manufacturers Association : " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up with a winner . " <P> Elements of the design are as old as powered flight itself . The original Wright brothers ' 1903 Flyer was of the canard type , with a pair of horizontal stabilizers mounted in front of the pilot . Though the shape had certain advantages in slow-speed flight  --  it was highly resistant to stalls  --  it proved too unstable at high speeds , and was eventually abandoned in favor of aircraft with stabilizers fixed to their tails . Now , with computers available to design planes and with fly-by-wire controls to help steer them , Beech and ) Piaggio have revived the original concept . <P> The result is two aircraft that are every bit as revolutionary as they look . Except for its landing gear , engine mounts and a handful of other components , the Beech Starship is constructed entirely of composite synthetics  --  graphite fabric wrapped around honeycombed Nomex , a nylon-like material used in fireproof clothing . This makes the twin-engine plane lighter and stronger than similar craft constructed , in the conventional manner , of aluminum . <P> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the air . A pair of 7-ft. tip sails , fitted to the end of each wing , serve as vertical stabilizers and help reduce aerodynamic drag . The forward-mounted canards swivel back during high-speed flight to further reduce drag and are equipped with elevators that eliminate the need for a tail . Beech is keeping the Starship 's performance characteristics secret , but early reports suggest it can reach cruising speeds approaching those of business jets at about 40% the fuel cost of a Gates Learjet or a Cessna Citation . The Starship sells for $3.7 million , a little over half the price of a similar-size jet . <P> Piaggio 's Avanti , while sharing such features as rear-facing engines and nose-mounted wings , has a somewhat less radical design . It is equipped with a standard tail and is built mostly of aluminum . But Piaggio claims it will fly faster and more efficiently than its U.S. competitor . Prices will be roughly comparable .
