The Mounties close in <P> Two wealthy U.S. business executives , Jay Van Andel and Richard DeVos , faced indictments last week on criminal charges that they had defrauded the Canadian government of more than $22 million in import duties between 1965 and 1980 . Van Andel , 58 , and DeVos , 56 , are chairman and president of Amway , a large direct-selling organization that claims $1.5 billion in annual sales and at least 1 million distributors , mostly part-timers , who peddle the company 's diverse line of products , from laundry detergents to health food . <P> Van Andel and DeVos founded the company , and they and their families own the whole thing . Forbes calculated in September that together the executives were worth $550 million , which put them well up on the magazine 's list of the 400 richest Americans . Though Amway has its headquarters in tiny Ada , Mich. , Van Andel and DeVos are widely known for their espousal of conservative political and economic ideas . Moreover , Van Andel served in 1979-80 as chairman of the U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's finance chief until he was fired in August by G.O.P. Chairman Richard Richards . <P> The criminal charges , which were also brought against Amway itself and two other top company executives , appeared to take Van Andel and DeVos by surprise . But Amway 's troubles in Canada are nothing new . Two years ago the Canadians brought suit against the company to collect $118 million in back customs taxes and penalties , arguing that Amway had understated the value of the goods it was importing for sale . <P> Amway says that the problem arises because its unusual structure makes figuring the customs taxes difficult . Under Canada 's rules , the amount of duties on American-made items is determined by the wholesale selling price in the U.S. But Amway has no wholesale prices as such , only the much higher prices used by its system of independent distributors , many of them husband-and-wife teams . <P> DeVos and Van Andel say the Canadians approved the company 's system for handling valuations back in 1965 , but the Canadians are arguing that Amway never stuck to that plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bogus invoices to fake a low level of wholesale prices . After the customs people filed civil charges against the company , a criminal investigation leading to the indictments was begun by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police . <P> Van Andel said Amway was " totally innocent of any wrongdoing . " Said DeVos : " The 1965 agreement was made between honorable people at the time . " DeVos also told TIME , " We do n't think they have a case . In no way whatsoever are we crooked . " <P> DeVos blamed Amway 's problems on " false and misleading evidence " given the Canadians by the company 's former financial vice president , Edward Engel , who is now business manager of the Detroit Free Press . In August , the newspaper published a sweeping expose of Amway 's business practices , replete with internal corporate memorandums , but denies that Engel was its main source .
