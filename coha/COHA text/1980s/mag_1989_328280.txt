Not since the energy shocks of the 1970s has a Big Oil company been so vilified . From corner filling stations to the halls of Congress , Exxon came under attack last week for its role in the Alaskan oil spill . In Washington leaders of two consumer groups gathered near an Exxon station to call for a nationwide boycott of the company 's products . On New York 's Long Island , Suffolk County Executive Pat Halpin said the local government would cut its contractual ties with Exxon as a supplier . In California a lawsuit was filed that accused the oil company of boosting gasoline prices to help pay the cost of cleaning up the spill . Across the U.S. average gasoline prices since the spill have risen more than 8 cents per gal. , to a three-year high of more than $1.04 , at least partly because of the interruption of shipments from the Alaskan pipeline . <P> Exxon helped fuel the anger last week , when the company 's Alaska coordinator , Don Cornett , admitted that the oil company would add some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Said he : " If it gets to the consumer , that 's where it gets . It 's just like any other cost of doing business . " Urging Exxon customers to respond by cutting up their charge cards , Ed Rothschild , spokesman for the Washington-based Citizen Energy/Labor Coalition , declared , " Consumers do not have to be added to the list of Exxon 's victims . " <P> Until the grounding of the Exxon Valdez on March 24 , the largest U.S. oil company had been cruising along with a good reputation and 1988 profits of $5.3 billion . But now Exxon faces not only a public outcry but also a financial liability that could dent its earnings and preoccupy its managers for years . Some 20 class-action lawsuits have already been filed on behalf of Alaskan fishermen and businesses . The company is even getting something of a cold shoulder on Wall Street , where last week it ran into unexpected trouble selling a $110 million issue of two-year bonds , a modest offering for a behemoth with annual revenues of $88.6 billion . <P> Exxon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ putting one of its largest tankers in the hands of a known alcoholic , Captain Joseph Hazelwood , who may have been drunk at the time of the accident . Last week Exxon 's failure to keep tabs on Hazelwood was underscored by Bruce Amero , a former employee , who went public with claims that the captain was often drunk on duty . Amero , who worked under Hazelwood as second mate from 1980 through 1982 , is suing Exxon for $2 million in damages in New York State Supreme Court in Manhattan . Charging that Hazelwood 's " abuse and harassment " caused him to suffer a nervous breakdown , Amero has testified that a bad joke had been making the rounds in the Exxon fleet : " Where Joe Hazelwood is captain , Jack Daniel 's is the chief mate . " <P> Some oil-industry experts have alleged that Exxon 's sluggish initial response to the Alaskan accident was partly the result of another corporate lapse : the reduction of its spill-management staff during cost cutting in the mid-1980s . The company lost nine of its top environmental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inventor of Corexit 9527 , a commonly used oil-slick dispersant .
