The wave of collapsing oil prices might not have crested yet , but it is already having profound effects on U.S. consumers and businesses . The most immediate result is dramatic cuts in the prices of gasoline , heating oil and diesel fuel . When it comes to oil-based products , ranging from plastics to pesticides , the effect will be more gradual and unpredictable . And the saving in the energy-cost component of virtually every kind of manufactured goods will be even more subtle . Ultimately , though , the U.S. is headed for a sweeping shift in the way Americans spend their money , as dollars saved on energy are invested or consumed elsewhere . <P> Overall , the price plunge is acting , in the words of Merrill Lynch Analyst Constantine Fliakos , " like a huge tax break " for the U.S.  --  or at least for those Americans who are not in the oil business . February 's dramatic .4% fall in the Consumer Price Index , the biggest decrease since 1953 , was largely the result of dropping oil prices . Says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " The real impact of declining oil prices is what you 're going to do with the extra money in your wallet after you 've visited the gas station . Maybe you 're going to go out and buy a pair of shoes . Maybe you 're going to take a vacation . It 's going to mean a big increase in real disposable income . " Agrees Merrill Lynch Chief Economist Donald Straszheim : " The oil- price decline is like a blood transfusion to a wounded patient . As the victim pulls through , we 'll see one pleasant surprise after another . " <P> The sheer size of the potential petroleum " tax break " is stunning . Last year the U.S. economy consumed some 15.7 million bbl. of crude oil a day , at an average price of $27 per bbl . Total cost : $155 billion . According to the Washington Analysis Corp. , an economics- and market-research firm , a petroleum price of about $10 per bbl. for the rest of 1986 would boost American disposable income by $84 billion this year , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a Department of Energy economist estimates that if the average price of crude stabilizes this year at $15 per bbl. , the saving would be $69 billion . <P> A large part of the windfall will go to motorists . As if to revel in that prospect , radio stations across the country last week offered cash prizes to the service-station operator who " bid " to sell his product at the lowest price . In Milwaukee , the Park Plaza Mobil station sold off 8,000 gal . of regular unleaded at 36.9 cents per gal . In Concord , Calif. , the Sun Valley Auto Wash , a Chevron station , offered gasoline for .1 cents per gal. , while in Diamond Bar , Calif. , George Benitez 's Shell service station went one better by offering for one day up to 30 gal . of regular leaded per customer at .00l cents per gal . Then , overwhelmed by the task of making change , Benitez dropped the charge altogether . In scenes that were ironically reminiscent of the gas- shortage panics of the 1970s , motorists in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fleeting bargains .
