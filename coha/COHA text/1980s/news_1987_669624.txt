Somewhere out there , beyond the runway lights , lurks something that the Russian Slav has feared throughout his history : change . The whole world wants to know how much , how fast , for how long. // I was last here five years and three leaders ago . What clues , what change will I find ? // // At first , it all seems the same . Sheremetyevo Airport is still glass-sided modern on the outside , KGB and bureaucratic on the inside . Heading for the Intourist car to the hotel , the same slush reaches for the ankles , the same pungent low-octane gas fumes stream from exhausts. // The same winter darkness , the same wide thoroughfares , lined by the same endless , uniform , domino-like apartment houses . The minimal lighting is still a shock after the West . There ' s more traffic than before , but still far less than in Western capitals. // The old familiar lack of color : no bright lights in store windows , few neon signs , dark clothes , pedestrians dwarfed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To the Hotel Belgrade . Am assigned a wing no foreigners stayed in until recently . Hotel shortage is the same , exacerbated by a flood of businessmen and journalists wanting to know about Mikhail Gorbachev ' s reforms . Famous old Metropol Hotel near Red Square closed ( being refurbished by the Finns . ) When official guests take precedence at major events ( such as the recent Nov. 7 parade ) , businessmen must stay away , and visiting journalists must sleep on couches of resident colleagues. // My room is about nine feet square . No shower curtain , but water is hot . Manage to avoid ( mostly ) three nails sticking up on threshold of the bathroom . View across Moscow River is dark buildings , dark sky. // Downstairs in coffee bar , two women behind counter smilingly serve me , even though they are about to close . I sense again the warmth of the people , enduring hardships by wrapping themselves in shared experience. // As usual , hotel has no switchboard . Each room has a separate city number . No official @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ numbers , so know I can book an overseas call by dialing 333-4101. // Thursday : More sameness : breakfast in cavernous , dingy hotel restaurant is thin cheese , thin salami , bread , luke-warm tea // The drive to the apartment block in which my family and I lived for almost five years is exactly the same : same underpasses , same slush-spattered traffic , ancient trucks , gray-coated militia-men controlling the traffic , unpainted , monochromatic , concrete world. // Building is reserved for foreigners , so same uniformed guard in same windowed sentry-box checks everyone . Joyful reunion with maid and car-driver employed by this paper for many years . Same clutter of reference books , Tass wire-service rolls in office . Same immersion of foreign correspondents in the mysteries of Moscow and the Kremlin . Only new note : computer screens instead of typewriters. // Evidence of change emerges at dinner with US Ambassador Jack Matlock and wife - both personal ( almost all Soviet staff let go since Marine guard spying episode , so Rebecca cooks meal , and Jack drives himself to the Embassy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Soviet Union to 280 senior officers in the Soviet West Point , the Frunze Military Academy . Change indeed. ) . // Embassy thinks glasnost ( openness ) and perestroika ( restructuring ) are opportunity for West in general and US in particular . Effort to decentralize economy will disperse - to a degree , anyway - decisionmaking . A kind of political process could emerge . Gorbachev said to be distracted from more Angolas or Afghanistans . Soviets seen as less likely to risk confrontations meaning more guns , less butter. // If reforms fail , Soviet Union will be poorer but not necessarily more aggressive abroad , the theory holds . Fact is , no one really knows . It ' s generally agreed , though , that Gorbachev ' s efforts are extremely important , well overdue , and historic in scope and implications. // Russians and Westerners alike ask , what about prices ? // They ' re rising in Eastern Europe , causing panic buying and concern about new rebellion in the streets . As usual , Moscow is the last to move . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self-financing ' ' - planning own production schedules , output , and staffing - Jan. 1 . Yet prices are to stay the same for now , changing only in two or three years . No one knows just how or by how much . Sameness in the midst of change : We just don ' t know . Maybe the Kremlin doesn ' t know yet , either. // The new freedom of expression remains limited , controlled . The recent news about the sacking of Boris Yeltsin was given to foreign correspondents several times before his firing was announced in Pravda . What he actually said to earn dismissal still hasn ' t been revealed . Colleagues say pro-reform Soviet friends were dismayed : Are the changes now slowed , even derailed ? Again , no one knows for sure. // I pick up a copy of Moscow News , a weekly . It interviews a Russian journalist who emigrated in 1979 and was allowed back in for an Ottawa newspaper . ( Once such a return was unthinkable . ) He says he has been better able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glasnost : ' ' Never . . . have I seen such a landslide of hopes. ' ' // Change : US diplomats live in rows of new apartments and town houses on new US Embassy grounds , after a decade of construction . Offices still empty because of US concern about Soviet bugging . Building may never be occupied . Five top stories to be rebuilt . Dine with old friends , journalists . Am shown new cafeteria , new swimming pool , new basketball court. // Sunday : Lunch with BBC-TV ' s Brian Hanrahan at new Mezhdunarodnaya Hotel ( known to foreign community simply as ' ' the Mezh ' ' ) . Unprepossessing concrete exterior . Huge Hyatt-syle open lobby , glass-sided elevators , fountains , trees , crimson carpets , chromium-plated lights : Moscow ' s answer to Western luxury hotel. // After many months here , Hanrahan is still permitted no office . He shares cramped rooms with Jeremy Harris of BBC radio , who broadcasts to 100 million listeners a week in Britain and on shortwave World Service from little more than a shoebox. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strictures against drinking have closed many . Everyone buys same : three small bottles of vodka . Many more people make home brew : sugar consumption shot up 14 percent last year . Fewer drunks on street , but more appearing now. // Monday : More change : walk the length of the Arbat , famous old Moscow street . Now a pedestrian mall . French-style street lights : clear globes on black metal stands . Some new shops . Hard to be fashionable and insouciant in thick overcoats and cheap fur hats . Nice try , though , and must be pleasant in summer. // Walk down hill and turn left on Karl Marx Prospekt . The yellow-painted Manege exhibition hall , formerly Czars ' stables , now closed to store books from the Lenin Library ( also closed , for repairs . ) Main Conservatoire concert hall closed . Famed Bolshoi Opera and Ballet House supposed to be closed for repairs lasting years , but is still open . Repairs said to be scaled back. // And some things never change : catch glimpse of the striped onion domes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Red Square . Spectacular splashes of color against the gray . Will glasnost/perestroika be just that ? Or will the grayness win ? // //
