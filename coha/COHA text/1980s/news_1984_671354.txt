In time , a Florida coroner is expected to establish the precise cause of Mr. Kennedy ' s death Wednesday at the age of 28 on the floor of a hotel room in Palm Beach . Already , one official has said cocaine was found in the room. // But as one friend put it today , that will be but a footnote to Mr. Kennedy ' s anguished life , dominated in the 16 years since the assassination of his father , Robert F. Kennedy , by drugs , alcohol and the seeming inability to handle the pressure of being a member of the most closely watched family in America. // About 40 people - Mr. Kennedy ' s 10 brothers and sisters , a dozen or so cousins and in-laws , some aunts and uncles and half a dozen close friends - began gathering at noon today in the back yard of the family mansion , known as Hickory Hill. // They talked softly in small groups , hugging , often crying , occasionally laughing quietly and apparently consciously avoiding talking about how David Kennedy had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outdoor wake on a beautiful day , " said one man who was there . " There were babies crawling on the lawn , dozens of dogs runnning around and through everything . There was something timeless about the day , something both tragic and exquisite. " // After Mr. Kennedy ' s body was carried inside , his mother , Ethel , accompanied by her children and a priest , spent several moments alone with the coffin . Then the others were let in , permitted to file by the closed coffin one by one . Many knelt and prayed. // Up until 1968 , the year he turned 13 and his father was shot by Sirhan B. Sirhan while campaigning for the Democratic Presidential nomination in California , David Kennedy ' s life seemed little different from that of any other youth in the sprawling Kennedy clan . The fourth of 11 children , he spent his days in private schools , on the waters of Cape Cod , in pick-up games of touch football. // Like his father , he was a middle child , the third son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , knew that middle children could sometimes get lost in the shuffle and competition between older , more independent siblings and the youngest , where parental doting most frequently occurs. // So Robert Kennedy paid a bit of extra attention to young David , took him along to the Senate - " Let ' s go to work , " he would say - made sure the forward pass went to him , gave him a special hug . Once , a family acquaintance remembers , the Senator even comforted David when he collapsed in tears rather than bark out his usual sharp admonition - " Kennedys don ' t cry. " // No one was surprised , then , when the Senator took David along on the campaign swing to California . They went swimming in the Pacific the afternoon of the primary and when a dangerous undertow began to pull the child out to sea , the Senator was there to pull him back . <> <> Father ' Larger Than Life ' // // " That seems to have made Bob even larger than life to David , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ publisher of The Nashville Tennessean , recalled today . " And then 12 hours later , he lost this father in a most horrible way. " // Alone in a hotel room at the time of the shooting , where he was supposed to be sleeping , David was watching election returns on television when the announcer broke in with the news and live coverage from the shooting scene . The boy was still alone several hours later when some of the Senator ' s friends came to check on him . In the judgment of some of them today , he had felt alone ever since. // " People reached out to him for the rest of his life , " one said . " Ted Kennedy was there a lot . His brothers and sisters and cousins all tried . But they could never really touch him . Something had clicked. " // To Michael Curtis , a senior editor who once worked with David Kennedy at the magazine The Atlantic in Boston , " He seemed to be struggling against demons. " // Nobody knows for sure what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s death might have helped create them , or why his life unraveled . But it did unravel , and he eventually fell under the influence of alcohol and druges. // Exactly when he first tried either is not exactly clear . Perhaps it was at school or perhaps it occurred on a vacation break on the Cape or at Hickory Hill. // " We ' ve heard tales both ways , " one member of Senator Edward M. Kennedy ' s staff said today . " Whatever the case , he started when he was pretty young. " // At first , he did not seem to be in any great trouble . He made it through a Massachusetts boarding school , the Middlesex School in Concord , graduating in 1974 , and that summer took a clerk ' s job on Mr. Seigenthaler ' s newspaper. // " I told the staff not to do him any special favors just because I knew the family , " Mr. Seigenthaler recalled . " He didn ' t need them . He was bright as he could be , and before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was hired for and gotten no less than eight stories in the paper . He was pretty good. " // While in Nashville , Mr. Kennedy purchased an old second-hand car and at one point set off on a visit to his family . Somewhere in southwestern Virginia , he was stopped for speeding. // The news services immediately picked up the story and Mr. Seigenthaler got a call from Mr. Kennedy . " He told me that he expected me to live by my ' no special favors ' order and to run the story , " Mr. Seigenthaler said . " I did . That tells you something about David ' s character. " // But other friends , particularly members of his family , were beginning to notice other things about David ' s character by then . He often seemed at loose ends , as though he was not part of the gang . Sometimes he acted as though he wanted to be liked ; at other times he acted as though he did not care whether he was liked or hated. // " He was extremely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never knew what to expect . Yes . There was a demon in him . And , try as he might , he couldn ' t get rid of it . He wanted to so badly . I thought that was obvious. " // There have been reports that around this time Mr. Kennedy began to become estranged not only from his friends and peers but also from his mother , Ethel . Writing at length about the Kennedy family in the current Playboy magazine , Peter Collier and David Horowitz say that the death of Robert Kennedy also left Ethel Kennedy in deep despair , to the point that she began paddling some of her children and once cried out , " I can ' t stand it anymore . You guys have got to get away from here. " // The authors later quote David as saying , " This was the point in my life when everything began to turn against me. " // Robert Shrum , a spokesman for Senator Edward Kennedy , said today that the Playboy article was " absolutely inaccurate , the lowest form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <> <> Stayed at Harvard Two Years // Whatever the case , David Kennedy was beginning to experience more and more serious problems . In the fall of 1974 , he entered Harvard , as had so many Kennedys before him , but he remained only two years. // A former classmate and close friend , who prefers not to be quoted by name , like most of Mr. Kennedy ' s acquaintances , says the drug habit became particularly noticeable at Harvard and eventually forced him out of school. // " I saw him become a tortured version of himself , " the friend recalled . " He was an extraordinarily bright , extraordinarily unhappy guy . There was a grouchiness and contentiousness that was tied to his intellectual strength . He would argue almost any point . It would drive you nuts. " // Some of Mr. Kennedy ' s acquaintances trace his heavy drug use to the aftermath of a 1973 accident in which he seriously injured his back when a Jeep overturned . While in the hospital , he was given strong painkillers and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first true peace he had ever known . <> <> Fixture on the Disco Scene // // In the years immediately after his departure from Harvard , Mr. Kennedy became something of a fixture on the New York disco scene , squiring handsome women , frenetically hopping from one nightspot to the other . It was not necessary to be around him very long in those days to sense that something was amiss , and in September 1979 , what Mr. Kennedy ' s friends knew privately became very public . He reported being mugged and robbed , of $30 , in the lobby of a Manhattan hotel that the police said was frequented by drug dealers and users. // A week later , Mr. Kennedy entered a hospital in Massachusetts for treatment of an infection of the lining of his heart . The infection is known as bacterial endocarditis and doctors say it is often a result of drug abuse. // " He was a very , very sick man , " a close friend of the Kennedy family recalled today . " He almost didn ' t make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drugs he was taking . But they almost got him. " // The Kennedy family determined that something drastic had to be done to help David break his habit . They called in a special therapist , Donald Juhl of Sacramento , Calif. , who began one-on- one therapy at the Kennedys ' Cape Cod compound in Hyannisport , then took Mr. Kennedy out to the West Coast . <> <> Treatment , Then Trouble // // The treatment , in which , among other things , Mr. Juhl seldom let Mr. Kennedy out of his sight , ended in April 1980 , when Mr. Juhl said his patient was cured . But a new problem erupted when Mr. Kennedy was picked up by the police three months later and charged with driving while drunk and driving without a license . His blood alcohol level was reported to be 0. 17 , substantially higher than the level of 0. 10 at which drivers are considered to be intoxicated under California law. // In October 1980 he changed a not guilty plea to one of guilty for drunk driving and was fined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dismissed. // " David ' s problem never has been drinking and it certainly isn ' t his problem now , " Mr. Juhl said after Mr. Kennedy ' s arrest . " It was just less than wise judgment to drive after drinking anything. " // Mr. Kennedy spent more than two years in Sacramento . " He liked Sacramento , feeling more at ease , more relaxed than at home where the press was always around , " recalled one of his new friends , Randy Paragary , an attorney who owned a tavern and restaurant . <> <> ' A Lot Going for Him ' // // " He didn ' t go for the celebrity thing , " Mr. Paragary added . " He didn ' t hide the fact that he was a Kennedy . But he ' d feel uncomfortable if anyone would introduce him as ' David Kennedy , Robert Kennedy ' s son . ' I thought he had a lot going for him , especially since he planned to go back to school and follow a career in law . I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real good sense of humor . He laughed a lot. " // At first , Mr. Kennedy lived in a small apartment in downtown Sacramento . But he left there after a burglary in which he lost an expensive stereo , moving outside the city into an apartment complex where there was a pool and squash court . He worked , for a time , as a laborer for a concrete company. // Despite his wish to stay out of the limelight , Mr. Kennedy did make one public appearance in Sacramento . He caved in to the call of politics - which few , if any , members of the Kennedy clan can resist for long - and , in March 1980 , spoke at a mock Presidential convention of high school students , nominating his uncle , Senator Edward Kennedy , for the Presidency . But President Carter was the choice of the students , getting 171 votes to Senator Kennedy ' s 96 . <> <> Renewed Thoughts of College // // While on the Coast , David Kennedy began to think again about college and he approached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told a former classmate , were supportive but skeptical . He said they advised him , given his past troubles , to do something to prove that he could function well and was clear-headed. // Mr. Kennedy was always interested in journalism , and his family arranged for him to get a job on The Atlantic . He was assigned to read manuscripts . But that did not work out - one Atlantic editor said " he was not good at it " and he told a friend he was bored by the work - so he switched to a clerical job , delivering mail and doing other odd errands. // He was also drinking heavily at that point , friends and co-workers say. // " He would frequently come to work , " one colleague said , " looking as if he ' d been up all night , his shirt untucked , often without a tie . His eyes were often bloodshot . He sometimes had a smell of alcohol on him and at times he would have difficulty focusing or talking . Sometimes he would fall asleep at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not show up for work . " <> <> He Left Harvard Again // // In the fall , he was readmitted by Harvard . John R. Marquand , an assistant dean who was Mr. Kennedy ' s adviser , said he did well as a student and " showed great promise. " // But in December , Mr. Kennedy withdrew from school once more . He remained in Boston , telling friends he might do a little traveling in time . But the only trips of any consequence that he took were to two rehabilitation centers for alcoholics and drug abusers. // The first , according to a friend , was in New Hampshire . " He was kicked out , " the friend said. // The second was in Minnesota . He was there , the friend reported , shortly before leaving for Palm Beach . <> <> Visit to Ailing Grandmother // // Mr. Kennedy arrived in Palm Beach on April 19 , one of several in the family who went for the Easter weekend to visit Rose Kennedy , the family matriarch , who is 94 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had come with a friend from prep school . They stayed in the room across the hall from David , and often had meals with him in the hotel dining room. // The staff at the hotel , clearly intrigued by the Kennedys , watched them closely and said that David Kennedy had visited his grandmother every day he was there . The last time they saw him , they said , was Tuesday afternoon. // Today , the hotel issued a statement saying that Mr. Kennedy ' s behavior had been " calm and quiet " and that he appeared " in good health to the best of our knowledge . " <> <> Secretary Sent to Check // // At 11 : 30 Wednesday morning , someone from his family telephoned to see if he had caught a plane . When his room phone did not answer , the desk secretary was sent to check the room , according to Gerald H. Beebe Jr. , a hotel spokesman . She let herself in with a passkey and found Mr. Kennedy ' s body , fully clothed , face down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // The body was returned to Washington today. // At Hickory Hill this afternoon , there were no speeches , no eulogies , no talk about what might have been . " After all , " said someone who was there , " this had been going on for 10 years or more . We all had little remembrances of David , nice ones , and we talked about them . But there was no one who felt he could have saved David. " // Late this afternoon , dozens of other people began to arrive at Hickory Hill , older people who seemed to be friends of Mrs. Kennedy rather than of her children , and she greeted most of them personally . A bar was opened , and servants passed out finger foods. // //
