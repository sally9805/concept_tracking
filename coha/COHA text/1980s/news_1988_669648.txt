The President is as uncompromising on this question as he is on the Strategic Defense Initiative , these sources say. // ' ' This is not a question of negotiating . We ' re not arguing . This is the President ' s policy , ' ' says one authoritative official. // // A senior Soviet diplomat last week rejected a privately-conveyed United States demand that Moscow end military aid to the pro-Soviet Kabul regime as part of an agreement on Afghanistan . The Soviet official said the US demand could delay beyond the current March 15 deadline the reaching of an agreement on the withdrawal of Soviet forces. // The Monitor has learned , however , that President Reagan has put himself clearly on record demanding a cutoff of Soviet arms to the Afghan regime . His position is set forth in a letter dated March 11 to Senate majority leader Robert Byrd ( D ) of West Virginia . The President was responding to Senate concerns that the US is yielding too much in order to get an Afghan settlement. // The President writes that Soviet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told that any US and Soviet commitments in an Afghanistan settlement must be ' ' symmetrical . ' ' A cessation of US aid to the Afghan resistance , the letter continues , ' ' must be matched by cessation of similar aid ' ' to the pro-Soviet regime in Kabul. // This position reflects the President ' s strong personal commitment not to leave the Afghan resistance stranded and yet to get the great powers out so that the Afghans themselves can solve their problems , officials say. // However , if the Soviets don ' t want to stop their aid , says a senior official , the US and Pakistan will continue helping the resistance and there will be no US support for an accord in the six-year-old Geneva negotiations. // The President has strong support in the Senate . Sen. Richard Lugar ( R ) of Indiana explains : ' ' Everyone active in the Senate on foreign affairs ' ' has told the administration for weeks that ' ' we can ' t stand by while the Soviets continue to arm Kabul. ' ' // Early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whereby all foreign military aid to the Afghan resistance would be cut off when the Soviet troops begin to leave . That commitment , however , was based on the assumption that Soviet troops would be withdrawn over the course of two or three months , rather than the nine-month schedule now on the table . Many US legislators worry that over nine months , the resistance could be put at a disadvantage. // That earlier US agreement ' ' isn ' t going to work out , ' ' says Senator Lugar , because any agreement has to make ' ' common sense ' ' to the American people . ' ' Time is on our side , ' ' he adds , even if a delay complicates preparations for the next US-Soviet summit. // The administration is not asking Moscow to renegotiate the Geneva accords , which have been worked out in United Nations-sponsored indirect talks between Pakistan and Afghanistan . Nor does the administration want to ' ' embarrass ' ' Moscow , say US officials . Mr. Reagan does not agree with legislators who want to continue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left , ' ' they say , but the President does want symmetry in US and Soviet actions. // Washington is seeking a bilateral understanding with Moscow to ' ' fill the gap ' ' between the existing Geneva texts and the President ' s policy . This will assure US support for an agreement in Geneva , say senior officials. // There is a separate Geneva protocol under negotiation regarding the withdrawal of Soviet troops , but it contains nothing explicit about Soviet military aid or advisers to the Kabul government . Washington says , however , that the commitment in the Geneva accords to end outside interference in Afghanistan applies to Soviet aid and advisers . The Soviets say their military aid is legitimate under long existing Soviet-Afghan treaties and thus does not constitute outside interference. // The pro-Soviet regime is ' ' artificial ' ' and ' ' created by bayonet , ' ' says a high ranking US official . ' ' We don ' t see it as legitimate , it is a minority faction . ' ' The resistance represents a large majority of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always recognize it as the legitimate government ' ' to justify US aid as ' ' noninterference ' ' using Moscow ' s current logic . But , he says , the overall goal is to get both superpowers out , so the Afghans can determine their future. // Washington is less concerned about the other issue currently blocking progress in Geneva - an interim Afghan government . Pakistan wants an agreed-upon interim government before a withdrawal accord is finished in order to minimize the chances of chaos and encourage the return of the 3 million Afghan refugees it shelters. // This is desirable , US officials say , but is not a US ' ' precondition. ' ' // The key drawback , says one well-placed official , is that no one can deliver the support of the Afghan players . Pakistan can ' t deliver the political leadership of the resistance alliance , the alliance leadership can ' t deliver the resistance commanders in the field , and Moscow would probably have a tough time delivering its allies in Kabul. // US officials also think that too much focus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The real power is with the commanders in the field , they say. // Even if the leaders of the resistance alliance were installed in Kabul , they would not remain in power unless the field commanders agreed , US specialists say. // Washington is not concerned about a pro-Soviet regime left without military aid . Officials believe it would crumble in a relatively short period. // What if there is no agreement in Geneva ? The Soviets would probably increase military pressure on the resistance . Pakistan would likely face new border attacks and terrorist bombings , officials say , but the greatest pressure would still be on Moscow to get out. // //
