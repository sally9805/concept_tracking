' ' I see all life as a part of God ' s creation , and I think it ' s rather audacious and presumptuous of humankind to consider that it has the right to destroy creation , to destroy all life , ' ' says Mr. Hatfield , a Republican senator and lay minister from Oregon . He leans forward intently , his mild blue eyes lit with the fervor of an Old Testament prophet . ' ' We ' ve developed the ability to destroy the planet , but that doesn ' t give us the right to destroy the planet. ' ' // He is sitting in his high-ceilinged Senate office in a straight-backed Victorian chair drawn up to a Revolutionary War drum doubling as a table . Hatfield has just raised the specter of Libya ' s building a nuclear bomb and warns that 60 other countries will have nuclear weapons by the end of the century . Almost on cue the phone rings , and an aide enters to whisper , ' ' The President wants to see you this morning . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Yes . Yes . . . . I ' ll be there at 11 o ' clock , ' ' in a calm , dispassionate baritone. // Hatfield is jointly sponsoring with Democratic Sen. Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts a resolution calling for a freeze on the testing , production , and deployment of nuclear weapons by the United States and the Soviet Union . He is the militant nuclear dove of his party , a man whose warnings echoed at the huge rallies in New York City last weekend keyed to the UN debate on a disarmament resolution. // At a later interview , he is asked about his sudden summons to the White House . Did it have to do with President Reagan ' s startling proposal three days later that the US and the USSR reduce their strategic missile arsenals by one-third ? Senator Hatfield smiles quietly . The official purpose of the visit was to appear at a presidential announcement on the budget , he says . Pause . ' ' But when I was down there , he ( President Reagan ) told me he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and said he thought I ' d be pleased . ' ' Is Hatfield pleased ? He is semi-pleased . Is it enough of a step ? // ' ' No . No . Not enough of a step . But . . . I ' m delighted , of course . ( It ' s ) a step in the correct direction , yes , indeed it is . I think the President ' s a very sincere man , but I think there ' s a built-in contingency there ( in the President ' s proposal ) that makes it impossible for the Russians to respond to us . I think that they could respond to a freeze . ' ' He will go campaigning for one , he says as slowly and inexorably as a boulder beginning to roll down a mountain. // Sen. Lawton Chiles ( D ) of Florida sees a parallel between Hatfield ' s adamant , initially unpopular stance against the Vietnam war and his present championing of the nuclear freeze : ' ' I suspect even if it ( the freeze resolution ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great influence . Some of the steps the President is taking and the other steps couldn ' t have happened without it . . . . The McGovern-Hatfield amendment was one of the earliest get-out-of-Vietnam propositions . . . . Time after time his propositions did not pass . . . but it was Mark Hatfield ' s perseverance over the years ' ' that set the pattern. // Senator Hatfield views the resolution as part of a national groundswell against the imminent possibility of nuclear war . It ' s one of those instances ' ' where the people are ahead of the politicians , ' ' he says . He ticks off the grass-roots support across the country , from New England town-hall resolutions to initiatives for a California referendum on the freeze . But the big push will not come at any particular rally or march , Hatfield says - the big push will be at the ballot box next fall , when the nuclear freeze issue becomes the litmus test for voters trying to decide which candidates to support. // As chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most powerful Republicans in Congress , but there is none of the traditional politician ' s flash about him . At first encounter he is shy , reserved , formal . It is only as he begins to explain the spiritual impetus for some of his political decisions that the reserve melts away like a Popsicle on an August day . Then the words rush out and he becomes so excited he sometimes has to wrap his arms around his chest to restrain himself. // Mark Odom Hatfield is a quiet man who burns with a fierce inner light . Slender , dapper , handsome in an ascetic way , he has a neat head of carefully brushed gray hair , regular features with just a hint of granite about them , and seers ' blue eyes with long , sandy lashes . Senator Chiles calls him ' ' an elegant fella ' ' ; at one interview Hatfield wears a chalk-brown pin-stripe suit , coordinated striped shirt , patterned brown tie , and brown patent loafers. // In place of the standard senatorial ego appears an idealism focusing beyond himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of old-fashioned goodness as palpable as pine soap. // It doesn ' t bother Hatfield at all that the President and many of the members of his own party do not share his impassioned warnings about nuclear apocalypse now . As Senator Chiles points out , ' ' Mark marches to a different drummer . . . he ' s very true to his own convictions. ' ' // He is , after all , the same Mark Hatfield who rose at the 1973 National Prayer breakfast , at which President Nixon was guest of honor , to stun the room with his words . In a modern version of Lamentations , Hatfield called Vietnam ' ' a sin that scarred the national soul ' ' and ' ' an exile of love from our hearts , ' ' remarks that did not endear him to a fellow Baptist and friend , the Rev. Billy Graham , or to the supporters of the President with whom he shared the podium . In ' ' Between a Rock and a Hard Place , ' ' one of the three books he ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ politics , Hatfield points out that his words were directed not at a president but at what he calls ' ' civil religion . ' ' He saw a ' ' corporate national spirit of self-righteousness ' ' over a war he considered a national sin , and a ' ' lack of penitent response among millions of Americans . ' ' He feels the same way about the arms race. // When he answers critics who call the freeze an aid to the enemy , ' ' junk food for the mind , ' ' or a ' ' hysterical , apocalyptic ban-the-bomb mentality , ' ' his tone is soft but the words tough : ' ' Interestingly , those were many of the same criticisms leveled against those of us who raised the questions about the validity of American interests in Southeast Asia , that brought us the longest war in ( our ) history. . . . ' ' // Hatfield ' s own election to the Senate in 1966 was a referendum on Vietnam ; he had spoken out from the start against the war , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1964 Republican National Convention . He voiced his antiwar protests so early , so vociferously , that the Washington Star called him ' ' the Senate ' s most prominent dove. ' ' // His office reflects his values , with its two well-thumbed Bibles and its Lincoln motif . The grave , sorrowful eyes of Abraham Lincoln gaze down from more than two dozen paintings and sculptures in a spacious room decorated with a gray marble fireplace and a red-velvet Victorian love seat. // Hatfield ' s definition of national security is quite different from that of many presidents . He emphasizes a ' ' spiritual muscle ' ' rather than stacks of lethal hardware . ' ' There is to me a direct ratio between the increase of our arsenals and the diminishing sense of national security. // ' ' In my opinion , the only president in modern history who had any comprehension of national security was Dwight David Eisenhower , who happened to be a five-star general. . . . // He said that there comes a time in a nation ' s life when additional money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ security , will actually weaken national security - when there are people who are hungry and not fed , people who are cold and not clothed . For in the ultimate sense , that expenditure becomes a theft from those people , from those needs of those people . ' ' Hatfield stresses that he is not a pacifist ; he believes we need a strong military , but he also believes we need a strong economy , a strong infrastructure , and ' ' a strong spiritual life in this nation . ' ' Hatfield says flatly that national security in the Eisenhower sense has been greatly weakened today by administration armaments spending that is a theft from the needy. // What he is most proud of in his 16-year career as a US senator is not some major piece of legislation , or that moment at the 1973 prayer breakfast with Nixon . It ' s the individual people he ' s helped which matters the most to him , he says . One example : persuading William P. Clark , when Mr. Clark was undersecretary of state , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jumped ship in Oregon from being granted asylum and citizenship here. // His office handles over 200 constituents ' cases each week . But his concern goes beyond Oregon to a global constituency of the poor . His association with World Vision , Bread for the World , and other private groups is prompted by his almost biblical anguish over poverty anywhere in the world : // ' ' You know , in the Old Testament and New Testament , the most frequent measurement of people ' s righteousness by God ' s measurement , is our relationship to the poor . When we tolerate anyplace on this globe any kind of poverty and starvation , ( we ) are also by the way ( tolerating ) , from a nontheological point of view , the seedbeds of violence and war . . . . When I think of what the world spends on armaments , two weeks of that expense - about $17 billion - could provide enough food , clothing , housing , clean water , for all the poor people in the world . . . I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sometimes asks him , ' ' Why do you want to save a world that doesn ' t want to be saved ? ' ' The Hatfields married after a five-year courtship which began when the campus promotion king at Willamette decided to promote a romance between Hatfield , then dean of students , and the Portland State College dean of women , Antoinette Kuzmanich . When she decided to leave her Roman Catholic faith to join his Baptist church , the couple faced down a campaign of ecclesiastical disapproval from her former church directed at her - and at his political career . ( Hatfield says that wouldn ' t happen now , after the ecumenism of Pope John XXIII . ) They married in 1958 , the year he became the youngest governor in Oregon ' s history. // With flashing brown eyes , black hair , and vivacious prettiness , Antoinette Hatfield manages to be both exotic and motherly-looking at the same time . Mrs. Hatfield , a candid , buxom woman in a Delft blue suit and pearls , runs her own successful real estate business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 22 ; Mark O. Jr. , 21 ; Theresa , 17 ; and Charles ( Visko ) Vincent , 15. // There are those who point to an occasional flaw - or idiosyncrasy . Hatfield is infamous for pouring hot coffee over his ice cream . He has been described as tight - with his own money as well as the taxpayers ' . And he considers Herbert Hoover a political hero . That may spring from the fact that his first political act was distributing handbills at the age of 10 to reelect Hoover , an adoptive Oregon native son , for president. // He grew up in Dallas , Ore. , in a small-town atmosphere straight out of a Norman Rockwell painting , in a childhood with simple pleasures : making tin-can telephones ; carving whistles out of willow sprouts. // His father , C. D. , was a Democrat , a blacksmith in the bridge and building department of the railroad , ' ' a spiritual man ' ' who taught him the 12 tribes of Israel , four verses of ' ' America the Beautiful , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted him to be a minister. // His mother , Dovie Odom Hatfield , was a schoolteacher and a Republican , who urged him to make a name for himself . When he was 5 , she parked him and her husband with her mother and went off to college for four years . After Salem High School , a BA from Willamette University , and service in World War II as a Navy lieutenant junior grade ( Iwo Jima and Hiroshima ) , Hatfield took his master ' s in political science at Stanford , where he became a Republican . With his first job as an educator , at Willamette , he also began his political career as county chairman for the National Citizens Committee for the Hoover Report ( on efficiency in government ) . From there it was a steady climb to state representative , state senator , secretary of state , then governor. // While he has been described as having been personally ambitious early in his political life , his biographers Robert Eells and Bartell Nyberg devote a chapter of their book ' ' Lonely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a spiritual crisis in his life at the age of 31 that changed his focus . Turning to the story of Job in the Bible , Hatfield decided that Job ' s decision of unconditional commitment to serve God would be his . It is that spiritual commitment that has made him a sometimes reluctant candidate ( he ' s not sure whether he ' ll run in 1984 ) when he has felt a clash between politics and his own principles . But his basic view is that church members must ' ' witness ' ' to their faith by becoming involved in politics , not ignoring its evils but helping clean it up . Would he run for president ? Hatfield flatly answers ' ' No. ' ' // ' ' I have not reached the point . . . of selling my soul to Mephistopheles for a political career . I think you have to have a burning feeling in your lower abdomen that you are willing to make compromises with principle . I don ' t say this is true of people who seek the presidency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' // But he has equally strong words for Moral Majoritarians ( such as those who mounted a campaign against him in Oregon ) and who would try to equate a political vote with spiritual worthiness in issues like school busing , abortion , and the Panama Canal . ' ' It is sloppy communication that frequently says if I am correct on this list of political issues , then that will equate to my relationship to God or be evidence of my spirituality or my Christianity . Now that ' s what I call apostasy , ' ' he warns , ' ' that is politicizing the gospel. ' ' // Anyone as outspoken as Hatfield on deep moral issues generally polarizes people . But as Sen. Arlen Specter ( R ) of Pennsylvania points out , ' ' He ' s held in high regard by members on both sides of the aisle for his integrity , good judgment , effectiveness . ' ' Senator Specter says people ' ' may find Mark Hatfield in disagreement with their positions but never disagreeable . . . he does it without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Sam Nunn ( D ) of Georgia all mention the respect with which Hatfield is viewed in the Senate across party and ideological lines . ' ' He ' s not afraid to speak out on an issue even though he may be the single , lone voice , ' ' Senator Nunn says . ' ' He doesn ' t need to get 51 votes before he comes out for something . . . . Of course he does have erroneous views every now and then - he ' s wrong on national security. . . . ' ' // Perhaps the best comment on Hatfield ' s character was made as a parting shot by his wife , after sitting for a rare interview . Mrs. Hatfield does not suffer the press gladly , but as she smiled goodbye , she said , ' ' Whatever story you do , the man will shine through. ' ' // //
