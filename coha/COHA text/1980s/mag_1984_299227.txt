In Los Angeles , the trials that time men 's bodies <P> In the blinking sunshine and swirling breezes of Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum , clean and cheerful if never more than one-third full , the US . Olympic track-and-field team was determined last week in a stirring celebration of more than Carl Lewis , but Lewis most of all . Before a man can win four gold medals , he must qualify in four events , and Lewis did this with a flourish , though without posting any records . Fragile Sprinter Evelyn Ashford 's gold-medal ambitions declined from three to two . Hurdlers Edwin Moses and Greg Foster rejoiced . Mary Decker found out she could run only as far as the law would allow . And a wound-up Methuselah named Ed Burke took a 16-lb. ball by the chain , swung it and flung it , and spun something wonderful . <P> Fortified by Sister Carol 's special chicken curry with rice , chauffeured by his father Bill , cheered by his mother Evelyn ( when she could bear to watch ) , only Lewis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many heats under so much pressure . " I 'm not saying it 's easy , " he announced at the outset , " but it 's attainable . I 'm ready to roll . " He won the 100-meter dash in 10.06 with his familiar finishing crescendo , over Football Players Sam Graddy of Tennessee and Ron Brown , soon of the Los Angeles Rams . So the 4 X 100-meter relay team was set , too , in this likely order : Graddy leading off , Brown the second leg , Calvin Smith the third , Lewis the anchor . <P> Without straining , he won the long jump by about a foot and a half ( 28 ft. 7 in. ) and turned to the 200-meter run . " I 'm still a novice in the 200 , as compared with the 100 , " he said , after burning through the curve in 19.86 and then kissing the track like an explorer . Kirk Baptiste and Thomas Jefferson , who finished second and third , expressed the situation clearly when Baptiste said , " I hope I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advised , " The closer you get to Carl , the better your chances will be . " <P> Tom Tellez , who has coached Lewis for five years , observed , " Carl has taught me that the human body is an amazing machine and that the mind and its awareness are such important things . This is the closest I 've seen him come to being perfect . He 's on the edge of something phenomenal in all of his events . " Said Lewis : " I was always relaxed as a sprinter , but I did n't understand it . Coach Tellez taught me the importance of relaxation in competition . It 's realizing when you hit full speed that you only have to maintain . " <P> The second most compelling figure at the trials was Ashford , 27 , who has dominated sprinting in this country since 1977 but was hamstrung for the 1980 trials and also broke down during the Helsinki World Championships a year ago . Her resolve is stony : " I want to do all the commercials . I want fame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body is made of china . " If you sharpen a pencil point so finely , " says Leslie Kaminoff , Ashford 's physical therapist , " it can break . "
