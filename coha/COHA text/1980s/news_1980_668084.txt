Independent presidential candidate John Anderson today cut short a controversial tour of largely-Arab East Jersualem to visit Prime Minister Menachem Begin at a Jerusalem hospital where he is recuperating from a mild heart attack . Anderson aides had been trying to arrange the meeting with Begin since the candidate arrived here Tuesday on a trip clearly designed to woo Jewish voters . Begin ' s doctors have strictly limited the number of persons visiting the ailing prime minister and Anderson ' s meeting was not announced until early today . Anderson cut short his trip through the rebuilt Jewish Quarter of the walled Old City of Jerusalem in order to make the meeting with Begin . The Old City , with its holy places revered by Christians , Moslems and Jews , is part of the Arab East Jerusalem district that Israel captured from Jordan in the 1967 Mideast war . Israel ' s annexation of the predominantly Arab district has become a focal point of the Arab- Israeli dispute .

In Cairo , the Egyptian newspaper Al Akhbar said in an editorial that Anderson ' s support for Israel ' s claim to Jerusalem as its capital was " immoral " and a sign the independent candidate was fishing for Jewish votes " by any means .

Because of that visit , Bethlehem ' s Arab mayor , Elias Freij , refused to meet with the candidate and said he was " lobbying for the support of Jewish voters in the United States . " " Anderson is being brainwashed by the Israelis , and he is blinding himself to the rights of the Palestinian Arabs , " said Freij , one of the leading moderates in the Palestinian camp . Anderson said he would advise the Israelis against building any new settlements in populated Arab areas for the duration of the Egyptian-Israeli negotiations on Palestinian autonomy .

" I visited two of them personally today , " he told a news conference in response to the question of Israeli settlements , " and had the opportunity to view from the air the so-called Green Lines which separated Jordan from Israel prior to the 1967 war . " You can not see the topography of the Jordan Valley , of the State of Israel and of the Kingdom of Jordan without feeling that there are some settlements that can clearly be related to the security of the State of Israel . " But , he added : " Obviously the controversy arises where the settlements are located in heavily populated Arab areas , such as the one at Hebron . My opinion is that during the period when these delicate negotiations are continuing , it would be helpful to avoid controversies that inevitably arise over the establishment of settlements not related to the security of Israel .
