" The grand jury is an old institution , and it operates in an antiquated way , " says Laurie Robinson , the chief of the American Bar Association 's criminal justice section . For hundreds of years the purpose of grand juries has been the same : to determine whether there is enough evidence to bring an accused person to trial . But the confusing three-month period it took to decide whether Bernhard Goetz should be charged with attempted murder has put the grand jury system in the dock once again : one panel refused to indict Goetz for that crime , a second panel decided the other way , and the secret deliberations and procedures became almost as controversial as the subway shooting itself . <P> The Fifth Amendment requires a grand jury indictment before someone can be prosecuted for a major federal offense , and 19 states have similar rules for felonies . A grand jury , called by the prosecutor and made up of up to 23 randomly selected citizens , decides by a majority vote whether a suspect ought to stand trial . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jury . In most states defense lawyers are not allowed into the deliberations . Grand jury witnesses may be prosecuted for any crime they may mention in testimony unless they are granted immunity , a rule that proved particularly thorny in the Goetz case , since his four victims had cases pending against them at the time of the shooting . The target of a grand jury is not granted immunity for his testimony , since the purpose of the panel is to decide whether or not to indict him , but he of course can not be compelled to testify . <P> Secrecy has long been the most controversial aspect of the proceedings . Grand juries have always met behind closed doors to protect the reputations of the accused and to shield jurors and witnesses from possible retaliation . " There 's one woman who was a witness in the Goetz case who was scared to death , " District Attorney Robert Morgenthau says . " If her name was disclosed , she would n't have testified . " But critics say the secret presentation of evidence allows the prosecutor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The opportunity for abuse is too great and the opportunity for scrutiny too little , " says Ivar Goldart , a New York Legal Aid Society lawyer . <P> Today , 31 states allow charges to be brought without an indictment by a grand jury ; instead , a defendant may be charged either by a prosecutor 's written statement or after a preliminary hearing before a judge . ( Though a state may choose to call a grand jury , the U.S. Supreme Court has not forced states to comply with the grand jury section of the Fifth Amendment . ) Sixteen states now permit a grand jury 's target to bring his or her own counsel into the jury room under some circumstances . In New York , legislators are considering using grand juries only in cases where no one has yet been arrested . Another proposal would allow prosecutors to offer only partial immunity to witnesses in an attempt to solve problems like the one Morgenthau faced with Goetz 's victims . Britain abandoned the grand jury system in 1933 in favor of hearings before a magistrate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire in some states , Morgenthau points out : " I would rather have my fate in the hands of 23 representative citizens of the county than in the hands of a politically appointed judge .
