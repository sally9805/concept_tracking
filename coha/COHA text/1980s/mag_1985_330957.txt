Patrick Ewing will probably make more money , but Lynette Woodard , 26 , is almost certain to have more fun . Calling it " the opportunity of the century , " the 5-ft. 11-in. basketball player last week became the first female member of the Harlem Globetrotters , fulfilling a longtime dream . " The Globetrotters were always special , but they were even more special to me , " explains Woodard , whose cousin is ex-Trotter Hubie ( " Geese " ) Ausbie . The all-time best female college scorer when she graduated in 1981 from the University of Kansas , Woodard was captain of the 1984 Olympic gold medal- winning U.S. women 's basketball team and beat out 22 other women Globetrotter contenders . She will debut when the team begins its 60th- anniversary tour in Australia this week . So far , the new guard reports , breaking the sex barrier has brought no penalties from the men , who have behaved like " gentlemen . " What , those jokers ?             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
