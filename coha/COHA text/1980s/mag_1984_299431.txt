While keeping watch on interest rates , Wall Street is also sensitive to the winds of politics . For the past two decades the financial markets have followed a pattern : stocks rise in a presidential election year . The increases range from 17.9% in 1976 , when Jimmy Carter was elected , to 4.3% in 1968 , when Richard Nixon won his first term . <P> So far at least , this election year has been a different story . Despite rallies last week and in the summer , stocks are down for 1984 . At its close last week , the Dow Jones industrial average was 32.71 points below its 1258.64 level at the end of 1983 . The performance is ironic because Ronald Reagan , Wall Street 's favored candidate , has been way ahead of Walter Mondale , despite some recent gains by the Democrat . Wall Streeters say that if Mondale were in front , the market would be doing much worse . Investors are leery of his plans to reduce the federal deficit by raising taxes , particularly on high-income households . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forward to another lift right after the election , according to Gerald Hobbs and William Riley , professors of statistics and finance at West Virginia University . In a study of election-time stock behavior since 1900 , they found that the market usually rises in the days just after the presidential voting . Their explanation : the uncertainty of the campaign is over . That temporary spurt generally lasts longer if the Republican candidate wins . Should investors want to rely on historical patterns , counsel Hobbs and Riley , they should sell on the 27th day after a Reagan victory , but only three days after a Mondale upset . <P> In the year after an election , the market usually reverses course and does better for Democratic Presidents than Republican ones . No Republican President since Calvin Coolidge in 1925 has enjoyed a stock rise in the year after being elected or reelected . Democratic winners , in contrast , have experienced five up years immediately after elections and only three downers . The apparent reason for the difference is that Republicans have tended to restrain Government spending and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expansionary policies . <P> By that historical precedent , the market will go down next year if Reagan is reelected . But sellers , alas , need to know about another omen : in every year ending in 5 during this century , from 1905 to 1975 , stocks have gone up , no matter which party was in power .
