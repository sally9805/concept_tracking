Oh boy , the Commies are back ! At least I think it ' s the Commies , but maybe it ' s not . The President was not specific and the White House , when queried , was vague also . All we know is that the President of the United States says that the nuclear-freeze movement is not " inspired by . . . sincere , honest people who want peace , but by some who want the weakening of America and so are manipulating many honest and sincere people . " Sounds like Commies to me . The White House would not say just who these people are who are soft on nukes . All it would say is that , " This is just a general statement on his ( the President ' s* part . " Left unsaid , but clearly implied anyway , was the suggestion that this was just another presidential remark and under the rules that apply only to Ronald Reagan it is considered unfair and petty to ask him , politely of course , just what in the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ White House ? For almost two years , the President has shown with impunity that he knows the facts only occasionally . At his most recent press conference , for instance , he said that " for four quarters we have seen a growth in the gross national product . " At best he ' s half right . For only two of the last four quarters did the GNP expand . It contracted in the other two . This sort of thing has gone on for so long that a presidential mistake is hardly treated as significant . The upshot is that the President , like a child , is being patronized , treated , in fact , the way he treated Jimmy Carter : " There he goes again . " The President ' s attitude is that these are nothing but details . He is a Big Picture guy . The trouble is that the big picture is composed of lots of little pictures and , anyway , it is the President who brings up these examples . Here is a man who creates his own data base @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the facts alone do not justify his position - who lives in a world of imaginary programs with imaginary ramifications certified by imaginary numbers . More and more his program is beginning to look like the Yellow Brick Road . The Wizard is blowing a lot of smoke . Up to now , the World According to the Gipper has seemed like an innocent- enough concoction of sloppy homework , whole cloth and a wish or two . But when the President impugned the motives of people in the nuclear-freeze movement , giving them the choice of being either dupes or unpatriotic , and offering no substantiation of the charge , he stepped over the line . The image of a friendly but bumbling Ronald Reagan suddenly blurred into one of a mean and menacing Joe McCarthy . The issue is not whether the President is a nice guy or not - whether he intends to deceive or whether he just stumbles into misstatements . What matters are the results . It seems almost unfair to hold the President accountable for what he says . His mistakes and homespun fictions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excused for thinking that , unlike other politicians , his rhetoric does not have to conform to the facts . But now , emboldened or unchastened , he has slipped into what amounts to demagoguery . When it comes to that , it is neither rude nor disrespectful to ask of the President what should be asked of anyone who questions the loyalty - and not just the arguments - of his political opposition . Mr. President , put up or shut up .
