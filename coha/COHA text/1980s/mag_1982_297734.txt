You are the bows from which your children as living arrows are sent forth . <P> - Kahlil Gibran <P> Palestine twitches on the small white mat , struggles to raise her head , and failing , falls back again ; she cries , then stops . Some slice of light has caught her attention . The nurse in bright pink carries a bird cage to the mat , and for a moment Palestine is pleased by two jumpy canaries-one black , one yellow . Now she rolls back and forth . Her legs , still bowed , kick out spasmodically . You can not tell if she hears the music in the nursery or the murmurs of the other babies , stacked up in their double-decker box cribs . She acknowledges no one . But everyone knows Palestine-if not by her blue " Space Patrol " sleep suit , then by the dark brown bruise on her right heel and , of course , by the circumstance of her birth . <P> For want of a standard term , the doctor on the case called the delivery a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ July in Beirut , during an Israeli air raid on the Fakhani Street P.L.O . offices , when Palestine 's mother , nine months pregnant , rushed from her apartment house in an effort to escape the bombs . No one is certain what happened next , but when the bombing stopped , Mrs. Halaby was found dead in the rubble . Three meters away , still enveloped in the placenta , lay her new little girl . <P> Only a remarkable twist , like the birth of Palestine , distinguishes one explosion from another in Beirut . For the past seven years the city has known the unremitting violence of the Palestinians , Phalangists , Syrians and Israelis ; the high period was a full-scale civil war in 1975-76 , which blotted out up to 60,000 lives , roughly the same number that the U.S. lost during 14 years in Viet Nam . For the past few years destruction has been confined to Israeli reprisals against the P.L.O. ; sporadic clashes of the Syrians , Phalangists and Palestinians ; and the ordinary run of street bombings and assassinations . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beirut is " overflowing with activity and variety . " <P> The odd thing is that either the Lebanese are the most durable people in the world , or they have achieved a nirvana of terror that allows them an unearthly jauntiness . The sight of a new bank in Beirut is as common as a bashed-in Mercedes . You can not tell if a hole in the ground is the work of a bomb or a construction team . The distinguishing sound of Beirut is the car horn-not the Beethoven or Roadrunner horn , but the I-am-going-to-kill-you horn . The most popular Beirut outfits are fatigues and berets , signifying the forces of the Syrians , the Palestinians and occasionally the Lebanese themselves .
