and Jules Witcover n Dec. 21 , 1979 , just a month before the precinct caucuses were to be held in Iowa , Richard Wirthlin wrote a summary of the opinion surveys his firm , Decision Making Information , had just completed for Ronald Reagan . Reagan ' s lead over George Bush nationally was 57 percent to 13 percent , and he was ahead in every state in which a poll had been taken . Bush was still so little known that more than 40 percent of the Republicans who were questioned professed not to know enough about him even to rank him among the contenders for the 1980 presidential nomination . " While this is a liability , " Wirthlin wrote , " it does indicate , however , that should he grab the early headlines by a win in Iowa , he could fast become , through favorable and massive media exposure , a rather and perhaps the only formidable opponent . " What this suggested was that George Bush enjoyed what the politicians call a " clean slate " nationally . What was critical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was what he wrote on that slate . Except among those closest to him , George Bush was believed to be an essentially " moderate " Republican who was competing with Howard Baker for support from the centrist elements of his party who were not prepared to accept the conservatism of Ronald Reagan , John Connally , or Philip Crane . He was a Yalie who still wore the striped ties and half-glasses that were hallmarks of the Eastern liberal establishment , and his father , Prescott Bush , had been a senator from Connecticut and a moderate . Although George Bush had built a career in Texas , he still had a summer home in Maine and sounded like it . Yet the fact was that Bush was every bit as conservative as Reagan on virtually every issue that Republicans use . In short , George Bush was able to build an identification that was based far more on his associations than on his views . That was enough to carry him through the Iowa caucuses , in large measure because of his organizational strength , but it was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their attention on him . There were doubts , too , about Bush ' s ability as a campaigner . His style was so boyishly enthusiastic it had already given rise to private derision that became public later when Garry Trudeau made him the subject of a sequence in his political cartoon strip " Doonesbury . " He was too much a preppy , the kinder critics said . He was a wimp , said the less kind ones . But in politics there is no vindication to compare with winning , and Bush ' s victory in Iowa sent him into new transports of enthusiasm . Now , he announced , he had " the Big Mo " - that mysterious quality labeled momentum , which politicians prize so highly . The first opinion surveys in New Hampshire and across the country seemed to support his argument . Wirthlin ' s polls , for example , found that just prior to Iowa Reagan had been leading Bush by 19 percentage points among Republicans in New Hampshire , but five days after the caucuses Reagan was six points behind . Nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few days later , after having been caught telling an ethnic joke to reporters on a bus , Reagan fell 13 percentage points behind in New Hampshire . ( The joke goes : How do you tell the Polish guy at a cockfight ? He brings a duck . How do you tell the Italian guy ? He bets on the duck . How do you know the Mafia is there ? The duck wins . ) In other states where Reagan had not been so active , both Wirthlin and pollster Robert Teeter found Bush ' s gain even more substantial . Ronald Reagan was no longer the complacent Imperial Candidate . On Jan. 23 , two days after the shock in Iowa , he met with John Sears and other campaign advisers in Chicago and insisted on a new campaign style . They settled on a strategy of intensive campaigning in New Hampshire and a daily effort to " make news . " Now that Bush was isolated as the principal alternative , Sears argued , voters would be taking a more serious look at the candidates than they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make the first cut . It might even be the finals . New Hampshire may not be representative , but it is familiar and comfortable , so the press of 1980 gave it the same kind of attention it had always received although its role was considerably altered . Reagan took advantage of this fact in making his new beginning , and a few days into February he began to gain ground as the glow of Iowa faded . Day by day , campaigning with a vigor that belied his 69 years , he closed the gap on Bush until , a week before the primary , he was essentially even with him . That night , Feb. 20 , all seven Republican candidates - Bush , Reagan , Sen. Howard Baker , John Connally , Rep. Philip Crane , Sen. Robert Dole and Rep. John Anderson - appeared in a televised debate in Manchester sponsored by the League of Women Voters . Bush always approached these debates , his advisers said , with more concern about the damage he could do himself with a mistake than confidence that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the voters .
