Pilgrims honor villagers who gave their lives to save others <P> Gerald Phizackerley , an Anglican archdeacon , stood last week near a rocky outcrop , surrounded by the heathclad hills and moors of the English Midlands , reciting a nursery rhyme : <P> Ring-a-ring of roses , A pocketful of posies , Atishoo ! Atishoo ! We all fall down . <P> There was no laughter from the congregation of 600 gathered in the field outside the village of Eyam . Some worshipers seemed close to tears , for this was a service to commemorate a rare act of heroism at the time of the Great Plague that struck England more than 300 years ago . The rhyme 's four bitter lines refer to the rosy mark on the chest of plague victims , the nosegays that people carried thinking to prevent infection , convulsive sneezing-and then death . <P> The plague , caused by bacteria usually spread by fleas carried on rats , raged through London in the summer of 1665 , killing 68,500 people , a sixth of the city 's population . Two-thirds fled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and remote , Eyam seemed safe . But that September a village tailor received an infested bolt of cloth from London . Within a few days the tailor died . Soon dozens of others were seized by raging fever , vomiting , giddiness and excruciating buboes ( swollen glands ) . But by the end of May the pestilence seemed to have run its course , with only 77 dead . <P> Then in the late spring of 1666 , the plague erupted again in Eyam . By then the few townsfolk rich enough to have homes elsewhere were long gone . Now even the common folk , most with nowhere to go , decided to flee the town . <P> It was then that Village Rector William Mompesson spoke up . Knowing that the departing villagers would spread the disease , he exhorted them to quarantine themselves in Eyam to save the rest of Derbyshire . Such was the authority of the clergy , the power of faith and the eloquence of the 28-year-old rector that the people of Eyam agreed . A circle was marked out with stones around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Devonshire agreed to provide most of the necessary food and other goods , which outsiders left nervously on the perimeter every week . <P> Figuring that indoor meetings were dangerous , Mompesson moved Sunday worship into a nearby field . When pious townspeople gathered to pray for deliverance , they stood at some distance from each other . The rector and a Nonconformist minister were the only visitors to console the sick , grieving and terrified residents . <P> By the time the plague had run its course 259 of the 350 villagers had died . One of the last victims was Mompesson 's wife Catherine . Assuming he was also destined to die , he wrote a farewell letter : " I thank God , I am content to shake hands with all the world , and I have many comfortable assurances that God will accept me . " To avoid contamination , he dictated the letter by shouting on the moor to a visiting clergyman . Mompesson did not die .
