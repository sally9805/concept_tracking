More boycotters join Moscow <P> The meeting of the eight-member executive board of the International Olympic Committee ( I.O.C. ) at Lausanne 's ornate Palace Hotel last week was billed as a last-ditch attempt to persuade the Soviet Union to reconsider its boycott of this summer 's Olympic Games in Los Angeles . But the effort was over before it began . Conferring privately the evening before the meeting , Los Angeles Olympic Organizer Peter Ueberroth and Soviet Sports Chief Marat Gramov found themselves in accord on one point and not much else . Said Ueberroth : " It would be misleading to suggest that we came even an inch closer to a solution . " Agreed Gramov : " The decision is irrevocable . " <P> Even before the meeting , Hungary and Poland joined the list of Soviet satellites stepping into line behind the boycott . That brought the total to ten , including the U.S.S.R. ( the others : Bulgaria , East Germany , Czechoslovakia , Mongolia , Afghanistan , Viet Nam and Laos ) . Warsaw 's decision was especially reluctant-and poignant-because much of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Polish organizations situated abroad , especially in the U.S. Keenly aware of the country 's straitened circumstances in the wake of the 1982 military clampdown , the groups wanted to assure a dignified and well-prepared Olympic showing for Polish athletes . Polish Olympic Committee Chairman Marian Renke , said a friend , was so disappointed that he looked " as if a tractor had run over him . " <P> That left Rumania as Moscow 's only Warsaw Pact ally still wavering . President Nicolae Ceausescu was abroad when the boycott was announced and has yet to voice an opinion on the subject . It was still possible that some other nations economically or politically dominated by the Soviet Union could decide to join the pullout ; Cuba is one such possibility . Even so , it seemed a fair bet that more nations will be sending Olympic teams to Los Angeles than the 81 that participated in Moscow 's 1980 Games , which were boycotted by the U.S. and more than 30 other countries . Said U.S. Olympic Committee Chairman William Simon : " We still expect to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Curiously , Gramov disclosed that some 200 Soviets would still be traveling to the Los Angeles Games , including " judges , officials , journalists and tourists . " That announcement provided one more indication that the Soviet decision to boycott the Olympics was based on political calculations rather than the security concerns Moscow claimed . Hearing of the Soviet attendees , Ueberroth asked sarcastically , " They would be safe , and the Soviet athletes in the protected Olympic Village would not ? "
