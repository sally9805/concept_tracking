A twelve-year-old boy hangs himself after being punished at school . A 16-year- old shoots himself while visiting a friend . Another boy takes his own life with a borrowed .357 Magnum . <P> The series of deaths in the booming suburbs of Cobb County , just north of Atlanta , are part of a " suicide cluster , " an affliction that has inexplicably visited half a dozen U.S. communities in this decade . The Centers for Disease Control began a detailed study of the county last summer after the suicide rate there was found to be 33% higher than the national average . The county ( pop . 400,000 ) has already suffered 51 suicides this year , including six teen deaths , and expects to hit a record 70 suicides by December . Authorities speculate that the root cause may be explosive growth . " Fifteen years ago Cobb County was rural pastureland , " says Dirk Huttenbach , a psychiatrist for adolescents . " Anytime you have greater instability and less tradition , you 're going to have this sort of turmoil . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
