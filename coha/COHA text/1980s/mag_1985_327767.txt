The afternoon was sultry , and along the deserted block of neat brick row houses in the Cobbs Creek section of West Philadelphia , an ominous calm had descended . Suddenly the thwack of rotors broke the silence . A blue-and-white Pennsylvania State Police helicopter arced in low over the roof-line . It made several passes over the street , then hovered 60 ft. above the two-story home at 6221 Osage Avenue . <P> In the helicopter cabin , Lieut . Frank Powell , chief of Philadelphia 's bomb- disposal unit , hefted a canvas satchel holding two 1-lb. tubes filled with a water-based gel explosive . After lighting its 45-sec. fuse , Powell leaned out of the helicopter bay and dropped the device on the roof . His target : a fortified , bunker-like cubicle about 6 ft. square and 8 ft. high . <P> All was quiet for the next half-minute or so . Huddled on rooftops and in the doorways of nearby row houses , flak-jacketed police officers , metal and a cloud of dust flying into the air . Said a resident of adjacent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the windows , it shook our entire house . " <P> From behind police lines , residents of Osage Avenue , who had been evacuated the previous evening , watched in disbelief as a column of thick black smoke rose from the rooftop . Minutes later flames appeared , mere flickers at first , then a mountain of orange . The fire raged unchecked as officials delayed responding so the flames ( they later said ) would burn through the roof and drop the bunker . Then they planned to drop tear gas through the opening . Just so , they hoped to flush out the occupants of the house , a bizarre radical cult known as Move . <P> But the strategic fire soon became a phantasmagoric inferno . Half an hour after the explosion , firemen finally moved to control the blaze . There was a rattle of gunfire in or around the Move compound , and according to some reports , the police returned it . Ordered back out of range , fire fighters watched as the flames spread first to adjacent houses , then down the street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Philadelphia Daily News Staff Writer Tyree Johnson , viewed the blaze from her front porch . " You could see the flames , 20 , 30 feet above the rooftops , reaching over like blazing fingers , igniting houses first on Osage , then adjacent houses on Pine . Soon a solid wave of flame was sweeping down the street . " <P> Suddenly a naked child dashed from the flaming wreckage near the Move headquarters . A team of policemen charged in pursuit . " They grabbed him by the shoulders and just carried him off , " says Johnson . " His feet kept paddling , like he was walking on air . " The terrified child was probably Birdie Africa , 13 , who with Ramona Africa , 30 , was one of the two known survivors from the Move compound .
