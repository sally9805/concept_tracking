The first time I taught my son , Robert , how to fish was in 1982 , when he was 2 . I did it the old-fashioned way : I took him to the K mart with Uncle Joe , our old friend and lawyer , to pick out a Complete Fishing Outfit for $12. 97 . Then we went to a pond , where Robert sat in the weeds and put pond muck in his hair while Uncle Joe and I tried to bait the hook with a living breathing thinking feeling caring earthworm . This is a very difficult thing , emotionally , and not just for the earthworm . It would be different if worms gave you some reason to feel hostile toward them , such as that they had little faces that looked like Geraldo Rivera . That would be no problem . " Let ' s go bait some worms purely for amusement , " you would frequently hear me call out . But the way worms are now , they make it very hard , writhing around and conveying , by means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concept " Please , please , oh , PLEASE , Mr. Human Being , don ' t stick this hook into me . " For my money , worms are far better at this kind of nonverbal communication than those people called " mimes " who paint their faces all white and repeatedly attempt to entertain you at street festivals , although to be absolutely certain , we would have to run an experiment wherein we baited a hook with a live mime . ( All those in favor of doing this , raise your hands . I thought so ! ) I think it would be more humane if we just forgot about bait altogether and shot the fish directly with guns , the way we do with rabbits and deer . I saw Roy Scheider take this approach to angling in the movie " Jaws , " and he got himself a real prize-trophy shark using a rifle for a weapon and Richard Dreyfuss for bait . Unfortunately this turned out to be a violation of our outmoded game laws , so Roy had to THROW THE SHARK BACK @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dozen teenagers and a helicopter in " Jaws II . " This is a totally unnecessary outrage , if you ask me , especially when you consider that it is NOT illegal to catch deer with rod and reel in most states . ( EDITOR ' S NOTE : He ' s raving . Pay no attention . ) Nevertheless , Robert and Uncle Joe and I did manage to land a fish , the kind veteran anglers call a " bluegill . " It was three to four ounces of well- contained fury , and it fought like a frozen bagel . Many times at airport newsstands I have examined sportsperson-oriented magazines with names like Tackle ' n ' Bait , and I have noted that the covers often feature pictures of bold sportspersons struggling to land extremely muscular , violent-looking fish the size of guest bathrooms whose expressions say , " Yes , you had better kill me , Mr. Sportsperson , because otherwise I will evolve legs and lungs and talons and fangs and come to your suburban home and wreck your riding mower and HAVE MY WAY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caught was a cute fish , a fish that would star in a Walt Disney animated cartoon feature called " Billy Bluegill Learns the True Meaning of Christmas . " Robby looked at it , then he looked at Uncle Joe and me with a look of great upsettedness in his 2-year-old eyes , and we realized , being responsible grown-ups , that it was time to lie . " The fish doesn ' t feel it ! " we announced brightly , almost in unison . " You see this sharp barbed metal hook going right though his lip ? ! It doesn ' t hurt a bit ! Ha , ha ! ! " Meanwhile , Billy the Bluegill was , of course , edging out the worm for the Academy Award for Best Performance by a Cold- Blooded Animal Gasping and Writhing Around To Indicate Extreme Pain . And so Uncle Joe , being an attorney , got Billy off the hook ( Get it ? ) , and we put him ( Billy ) back into the pond . After that , Robert and I didn ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when we went up to New York and Uncle Phil  --  who is not our attorney but Robert affectionately calls him " uncle " anyway because he is my brother  --  bought Robert ANOTHER FISHING ROD , meaning I had to teach him AGAIN . Fortunately there were no worms available , as they had all formed up into characteristic " V " - shaped patterns and attempted to migrate South , getting as far as the tollbooths on the New Jersey Turnpike . So Robert and I used " lures , " which are these comical devices that veteran anglers instinctively buy from catalogs . You would think that to be effective , lures would have to look like creatures that a fish might actually eat , but , in fact , they look like what you would expect to see crawling around on the Planet Zork during periods of intense radioactivity . For example , many lures have propellers , which you rarely see in the Animal Kingdom . In my opinion , the way lures actually work is that the fish see one go by , and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of them snags itself on the hooks . Back in the Prepuberty Era I used to spend hundreds of hours lure-fishing with my friend Tom Parker and his faithful dog , Rip , and the only distinct memory I have of us catching anything besides giant submerged logs was the time Tom was using a lure called a " Lazy Ike " and it was attacked with stunning ferocity by his faithful dog , Rip , resulting in a very depressing situation , veterinarianwise . So fortunately Robert and I didn ' t catch anything the second time I taught him how to fish , and I think he ' s now old enough to remember it clearly and thus never ask me to teach him again . That ' s the good news . The bad news is , I am sure that one of these days he ' s going to want to have a " catch .
