"  | Peter stayed for a week , teaching me how to make flapjacks , biscuits , and a few simple things , and I learned from him how to find gold , how to pan , what to look for . When he rode away , I did not know that it would be a long , long time before I saw him again .  | I n the passing of days , I rode often to the mountains or desert with Francisco , and often we accompanied his father and other Cahuillas who went to look at the acorn crop , for the oaks provided much of the living for the Cahuillas . It was important they be gathered at once or they would be eaten by squirrels or other animals and birds . Also , if ' the season was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be gathered . We rode along the watercourses to judge the mesquite and screw-bean crops , or to see when the tuna would be ripe on the cacti . The Indians knew each plant and what it offered in seeds , fruit , or pulp . On one day we came upon a dim , dim trail leading off into the remote distance , but when I pointed it out , they rode on their way . " It is a trail of the Old Ones , " Francisco explained . " You do not follow it ? " " It is their trail . We have our own . " " It might lead to water . " " It is their trail . " Yet only some of the trails were avoided , and I did not know why . Perhaps the water that had once been there was gone now , or the groves from which the Old Ones gathered had disappeared . And who were the " Old Ones " ? Each day I learned something new , and when we went to the desert and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plants were avoided . Having crossed the desert with my father , Mr. Farley , and the others , I had learned much , but I began to see that the area in  | which the Cahuilla lived , partly due to the range of altitude from below sea level to the top of the mountains at more than ten thousand feet , was richer in plants than those held by other Indians whose countries I had passed through . Occasionally we met other Cahuillas , and once a party of Chemehuevi , and all knew me because of my father . He had discovered their starving time and had come to them with beef cattle . Flash floods had swept away some of the mesquite groves upon which they depended , and dampness left by the rains had ruined the acorn crop , but the beef my father brought saved their lives . The days passed into months , and the months into years . In the house , I puzzled over the books , reading slowly , gradually becoming accustomed to the strange words , learning their meanings by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door , warning me of riders , and I slipped away into the dunes to watch . No doubt it was believed that I was dead , but my grandfather was an uneasy man , and perhaps rumors had come to him that somebody lived in this house . Once , when they would have entered the house , they were stopped by Cahuillas who rose like ghosts from the dunes , bows bent and rifles ready . The riders turned their horses and very wisely rode quietly away , expecting at any moment an arrow in the back and perhaps a pitched battle . The Cahuillas had followed them for several miles , making them aware their presence was not wanted . Yet I had not begun to understand the remoteness of the area in which I lived . The pass between the San Jacinto Mountains and Mount San Gorgonio was the best of all passes to the coast but was the last one found by white men . From a distance , approaching from the east , the high peaks loomed against the sky , seemingly an unlikely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Californios rarely visited the desert . Some of them had come by sea , others came over the inland route from Mexico that crossed the river near the home of the Yuma Indians , then the desert and the Anza route over the mountains , which lay south of  | the pass where I lived . There simply was no reason for them to make the long , difficult journey from Los Angeles to the southern desert . Nor was there anything here they wanted , nothing to incline them to make the attempt . The hot springs from which Agua Caliente took its name had long been used by Indians , but the Californios had access to hot springs that were closer , and the existence of these was scarcely known . From time to time a book vanished from my shelf , but always another book took its place , and once during my first months alone a sack of pinon nuts was left on my table . Another time a loaf baked from some strange , nutty flour . Reading became easier , so I welcomed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the exchanges of books to the Cahuillas , who might not have understood . Obviously , somebody was hiding out on the mountain who did not wish to be seen but who did not wish me any harm . If lie did not wish to be seen , it was his affair . When my father died , he left some six hundred dollars in gold coins . When the supplies dwindled away and Peter came no more , I took one of the coins from the iron box my father had hidden away to the small store to replenish the supplies . The storekeeper took my coin ; then , glancing around to be sure he was unheard , he said , " I ai n't askin ' you , boy , but if you got more of these , you 'd best not let folks know . Even the best people will talk , an ' there 's drifters come through who 'd kill a man for less than this . " He hefted the coin . " This here will buy you all you want and then some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are needful of something , just come an ' get it . I 'll tell you when I need more . " He seemed a kindly man , yet I trusted no one . His suggestion was logical , however , and I did as he proposed . Often alone , sometimes with Francisco , I wandered the fringes of the desert and deep into the San Jacinto and Santa Rosa mountains . Often I climbed in the canyons , occasionally staying out for days at a time . One day when alone I heard a horseman coming . The  | door was open to catch the coolness of the evening , so I took down my father 's pistol and stood in the doorway , holding it down by my side , only my shoulder , arm , and one eye showing . All my life I had been familiar with guns . Long ago I 'd been taught that all guns were to be considered as loaded and were to be handled with care , yet any rider might be an enemy . Yet when the rider came within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jacob Finney ! Tucking the pistol behind my belt , I stepped outside . As soon as he saw me he began to smile . " Well , now ! You 've growed some ! Mind if I get down ? " " Please do , and come inside . " Leaving his horse ground-hitched , he came in , putting his hat on the floor beside him as he sat down . He noticed the pistol . " You expectin ' trouble ? " " Yes , sir . They killed my father . " " Heard of it . From what was said , he taken one or two with him . Well , that 's too bad . He was a mighty fine man . " He would have taken more of them , but he tried to push me out of the way before he drew . " " Like him . " " How is Mr. Kelso ? " " Last I heard , he was workin ' a claim in the Mother Lode country . Farley 's got him a ranch down San Diego way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a couple of shades darker from the sun . How old would you be now ? " " I am ten . " " I 'll be damned ! You look four or five years older . You been takin ' care of yourself here ? " " Yes . The Cahuillas are friendly , and I spend a lot of time with them . Sometimes I eat with them , sometimes I cook , but usually I eat what they do . There 's pinon nuts , tuna , and sometimes berries . " " Surely ai n't doin ' you no harm . Seen the horses out yonder , too . You been ridin ' ? "  | So I told him about the wild country , the desert , the ancient sea bottom , and the old shoreline that could be seen along the sides of the mountains . " I 've found lots of shells out there , old seashells from ages ago . The Cahuillas say the sea has been in there several times . Or maybe it was water from the Colorado . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ packin ' my own blanket roll . " " Sure . I 'll put up your horse . " " Leave it to me . Always take care of my own horse , no offense meant . " He got to his feet , turning his hat in his hands . " I come out here a-purpose to see you . Did n't know if you was alive or not , but Miss Nesselrode  --  you remember her ? She 's been mindful of you . Sent me to see if you were alive . Said she told your pa she 'd care for you . " Ile grinned . " Not that you seem to need much care . " He went outside and I started some coffee . It was good to see him . When he came in and dropped his gear in a corner , I asked , " How is Miss Nesselrode ? " He chuckled , giving me a sly , amused look . " Now , that there 's quite a woman , Hannes , she really is . Purty , too . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ends , and went to church , and the first thing you know , she 's been proposed to a couple of times and is cuttin ' quite a figger there around town . She walks around with that lacy parasol of hers , and the first thing you know , she 's bought herself a horse an ' sidesaddle . " Seems she heard of some hard-up trapper who has ketched some sea otter . Saying nothin ' to anybody else , she had me buy those skins from him , at rock-bottom . prices . Then she shipped them off to China . Meanwhile she heard of another man up the coast who had skins for sale , and she bought them , got them off on the same ship . " She 's right canny , that woman is . She hired Kelso an ' me to do the shippin ' for her , an ' she 's just a mighty pretty young woman , visitin ' around . " You know how womenfolks are , always talking of clothes , babies , marriage , an ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listens , she gets acquainted with the families of Abel Stearns , Isaac Williams , Wolfskill , an ' them . " She has me buy about sixty acres of land , and on Wolfskill 's advice she plants it to lemons an ' oranges . Then she has Kelso buy another piece , which she plants to grapes . " Los Angeles is a sleepy little town . A lot of ructions down in Sonora Town , time to time , but the Californios do n't much care what happens as long as they have a fandango now and again , good horses to ride , and money to spend on fancy clothes . " They 're good folks , but there 's never been any pressure on them until now . Times have changed , and most of them ca n't see what 's happenin ' . You 've heard talk of beaver . When folks over in France and such places switched from beaver hats to silk hats , the bottom fell out of the market . There just was n't any money in trappin ' or tradin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think the mountain men were just a bunch of big ignorant trappers . You an ' I know otherwise . They were mighty shrewd men who went to tradin ' an ' trappin ' because if a man kept his hair , that was the fastest way to get rich . " Now that beaver do n't bring no good prices , what do they do ? Keep ridin ' a dyin ' horse ? Not them . Some of them had already been out here with Jed Smith , Ewing Young , and the like , so they come out . They 've got a little money , a lot of savvy , and they commence buyin ' . Some of them married Spanish girls , but whatever they do , they are in business . They open stores , banks , start plantin ' grapes to make wine , oranges , lemons , and such . Land is dirt cheap , so they buy land , most of them become Mexican citizens . " Now Miss Nesselrode arrives in town . She 's a mighty pretty woman and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women and they like to show off how smart they are . She sits in their patios , has that beautiful smile working , and she 's a good listener . " Kelso , he takes off for the Mother Lode country , but I  | stay around . You know something ? One reason I stayed is because I just want to see what happens . " Now , I 'm around her a good bit . I notice things . She 's losin ' weight , gettin ' right thin . When I stop by , she always has coffee for me , but she does n't invite me for dinner anymore . It takes a while to sink in , and then I get it . She 's broke . She 's livin ' on guts and the few dollars she has left . She 's invested what all she had in a gamble , a damn big gamble ! " What I 'm talkin ' about is the first six months she was here . One time I am tyin ' my horse to her gate and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her countin ' her money . It 's mighty little . She counts it an ' recounts it , an ' there ca n't be more than ten , twelve dollars there . She stands there , figurin ' like , chewing on her lip . " I knock on the door , she lets me in , we have coffee , and she is all smiles and she tells me she 's made up her mind . She 's gain ' to open a bookstore . " " But you said she had no money . " He chuckled . " Like I said , that woman 's got nerve . Real , down-to-bedrock nerve ! She 's holdin ' a busted flush and she bets everything on her last card . " The next morning she goes to see Abel Stearns . Now , Abel , he 's a shrewd man an ' he 's got more money than he knows what to do with , an ' he 's made it all himself . " She goes to him and tells him she intends to open a bookstore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is short of cash , but she wants to open the store now . When she walks out of there , she has the credit , and she already has a few books of her own . She gets more . " That store becomes a gatherin ' place for all of that old mountain-man crowd and some others . She meets the stage , buys books and magazines , even newspapers from people . Her place is the best source of what goes on back in the States . " Within a few weeks it is the place where Wolfskill , Workman , Rowland , Wilson , Stearns , and all that crowd come for news and to see each other . And she 's busy , workin ' around , but listening . I tell you , Hannes , within  | the next three months that woman knows more about what 's happenin ' in California than anybody ! " Stearns is n't hurting for money , she 's an attractive woman , so he does n't dun her . When she 's in business for about six months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you understand , then her ship comes in . " I mean that ship comes back from China and she has sold those otter skins to the Chinese for ten times what she paid for them . She pays off Stearns and she 's free an ' clear with money to work with . " So she stocks her bookstore , orders more books , papers , and such , and then goes up and down the coast , me helping , buying otter skins , cowhides , anything she can sell . " She goes out to remote ranches which have a time gettin ' hides down to the shore where they can be sold to the ships . She buys cheap . " She lives like she always did , goes about her business with a friendly smile and a kind of wide-eyed innocence . She owns her bookstore building , she owns another building close by , she owns a small ranch , some horses and cattle , and she operates her bookstore like it was a bank . That woman 's a caution ! " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liked her . " " That 's what brings me here , " Jacob said . " She wants you to come to Los Angeles . She sent me to get you . "  | Los Angeles ? " I do n't know . What of my grandfather ? " Finney tugged at a boot , then stopped . " I asked her that , but she says he believes you 're dead . " He has a place in town , but he spends most of his time out on his hacienda . When he does come in , he rides in like a king , with six or eight vaqueros riding along . " Jacob pulled off the boot and placed it on the floor . " She 'd give it out that you were kinfolk from back East . She has dealings with shipowners , ship captains , and the like . She could say you 'd just come around the Horn with one of them . " Suddenly I wanted very much to see her . She had been kind , and she had known my father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew he had respected her . Also , she was a no-nonsense sort of woman . I remembered the Indian she had shot . Then , for the first time , I was admitting I was lonely . " She 's worried about your education . She says she promised your pa she 'd look after you if anything happened to him . " " I like it here . " " You could always come back . Look here , Hannes , you ai n't an Injun . This here is all right for now , but what will you do when you 're a man ? Your pa had education . He could go anywhere . He could have been anything . " You ai n't an Injun , and no amount of livin ' out here will make you one . You come along to Los Angeles and  | have a talk with Miss Nesselrode . If you want to come back , nobody will stop you . " " I like this house , and some of the things belonged to my father . " " Leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down at the store , and you can tell your Injun friends . " " They do not come here . They are afraid . " " Afraid ? Of what ? " " They say this is the house of Tahquitz . They think because I live here that I have a special power , that my medicine is very strong . " He knew nothing of the story of Tahquitz , so I told him the little I knew . He listened attentively , then said , " I ai n't one to scoff at superstitions . To my thinkin ' there 's always some truth to the stories you hear . " He pulled off the other boot . " Then this place will be safe . We 'll just leave any truck you do n't need . " Lying awake , listening to Jacob Finney snoring lightly in the other room , I wondered about Los Angeles . It had been long since I had visited a town , so long I scarcely remembered anything before Santa Fe except glimpses here and there , little things that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four years ago . When morning came , I would take a hundred dollars in gold and leave the rest hidden . I would have my own horse , my own pistol and rifle . When I wanted to return , I could saddle up and ride . Traveling in the wild country was an old story now . Francisco appeared as I was putting the rifle in its scabbard . " You go ? " he asked . " To Los Angeles , " I said , a little proudly . " It is far , " he said . " Five days , " I said , " perhaps six . I am not sure . " " My papa was there . There are many big houses . " " No doubt . " " You will not come back . " " My home is here , in this house . My father is buried here . I will come back . "  | " You will not come back . " His face was solemn . " You are my friend , Francisco . You will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this house , and I leave my father 's things here . I leave even the books . " " Ah , the books . " He knew how I valued them . " Perhaps you will come back . " So we rode away when the sun was touching the peaks of Mount San Jacinto and Mount San Gorgonio , and the pass we followed led into the darkness that lay between them . As we topped the first rise , I looked back at the scattered palms , the mesquite , and the few huts , even the flat roof of the store . My house was hidden among the dunes , and I wondered about my unknown visitor who borrowed books and left others . Well , he would be pleased , I thought , to find two new books on the shelf . I had found them among my father 's things and I placed them in the place from which he had last borrowed a book . Looking back , I could see the Leaning Rock at the mouth of Chino Canyon . Some named it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one is away the Calling Rock calls you to return . It is also said that if you turn and see it as you leave , you will always come back . I looked long , for I wanted to come back . Francisco was there , and he was my friend . Jacob spoke of Los Angeles . " Is it by the sea ? " I asked , remembering my father had come to it on a ship . " No , it is twenty miles from the sea . At least twenty miles . " " Will we see the sea ? " " There are low hills and mountains from which it can be seen . There are islands far out across the water . You will see them . It is said that long ago the Chumash Indians made plank boats and went to the islands . They painted them red . I do not know why . " " My father told me of them . " " It was a custom , I suppose . Remember , now ! Tell no one you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the desert . You have come by sea , newly arrived from the  | States . Before we arrive in town , you will change into your city clothes . " " But they are small for me now , " I protested . " No matter . We will get others in Los Angeles . You have been months at sea . You would naturally have grown . You must be careful ! There is always talk , and even the gentes de razOn have large ears . If it is discovered you are from the desert , if they know you are your father 's son , you will be in danger . " " I will remember . " After a few steps by the horses I said , " I have no friends in Los Angeles . To whom could I speak ? " " You will make friends . Also , there is Miss Nesselrode , and I , too , am your friend . Most people talk too much , anyway . " We rode on , and my thoughts returned to words my father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and being silent , I heard a great many things which I wondered about later . There was much I did not understand and much I came to understand as I grew older . But there was much to think about when I was alone , and often I lay awake wondering about things that were said . There was a time when a man spoke very impatiently to my father . He had seen a copy of the Iliad lying on the table . " You are reading this ? " he asked . " I have read it many times . Now I read it to my son . " " But he is too young ! " The man protested , almost angry . " Is he ? Who is to say ? How young is too young to begin to discover the power and the beauty of words ? Perhaps he will not understand , but there is a clash of shields and a call of trumpets in those lines . One can not begin too young nor linger too long with learning . " Who knows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the intellect ? In some year yet unborn he may hear those words again , or read them , and find in them something hauntingly familiar , as of something long ago heard and only half-remembered . " Yet perhaps it is only that I like to hear those rolling cadences . People , I think , read too much to themselves ;  | they should read aloud from time to time to hear the language , to feel the sounds . " Homer told his stories accompanied by the lyre , and it was the best way , I think , to tell such stories . Men needed stories to lead them to create , to build , to conquer , even to survive , and without them the human race would have vanished long ago . Men strive for peace , but it is their enemies that give them strength , and I think if man no longer had enemies , he would have to invent them , for his strength only grows from struggle . " My father had waved his hand about at the stark Arizona mountains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sang of his ' wine-dark seas , ' but we , I think , will sing of these . You will find that our Homers will sing of the plains , the deserts , and the mountains . Our Trojans may appear in feathered war bonnets , but none the less noble for them . Our Achilles may be Jim Bowie or some other like him , our Ajax might be Davy Crockett or Daniel Boone . " My father was a tall man , and now he stood up . " My friend , " he said , " I do not know what else I shall leave my son , but if I have left him a love of language , of literature , a taste for Homer , for the poets , the people who have told our story  --  and by ' our ' I mean the story of mankind  --  then he will have legacy enough . " Was this , then , this ride to Los Angeles , was this like a voyage among the Greek islands ? Was this to be part of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! And I was wishing Jacob would decide to rest the horses , because I was tired . Yet , looking over my left shoulder and turning a little , I could see a fine sweep of mountains , and the pines that grew there . Again I remembered those long plains over which we had passed , the great tower and broken battlements of El Morro , the magnificent vistas of plain , mountain , and forest . Whatever else my father had given me , he had given me a chance to see these , to know them , to live with them . I thought of Francisco . Who had been his Homer ? What stories had he heard beside the campfire when the winter  | winds chilled the flesh ? For it was in the winter the Indians told their stories . Over the fire that night , Jacob warned me , " Do n't you be expectin ' too much . It will remind you some'at of Santa Fe , but Miss Nesselrode , she says we should n't be fooled by it . She says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best thing ever happened to it was when those beaver pelts fell in price . She told me one time , she said , Mr. Finney , it will be silk hats that build Los Angeles , because when over in Europe they stopped wearing beaver hats and switched to silk , it started all of those very wise , very bold mountain men looking for new ways to get rich .

Generous to a fault , give you the shirt off their backs , and do it graciously and with an air . " There 's another thing . They 're proud of bein ' Californios .

Back to the east , when a man wants to do you harm , he takes up a shootin ' iron of some kind , but out here it can be a shootin ' iron or it can be a knife or anything handy . You got to remember that folks were killin ' each other with rocks and clubs for a million years before anybody invented a pistol . So be careful . Learn to handle yourself and to handle weapons , but mostly you just learn to guard your tongue . A man out here who speaks careless of others will soon only have a marker in the graveyard . " We had been lying in our blankets , and the last coals were smoldering when suddenly Jacob raised up on his elbow , knowing I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , boy . She ai n't no mountain man , but she 's one of those who will make the wheels turn . I seen that right off . " You just set back an ' watch that woman operate . Ever ' time she flutters her lashes or turns her parasol , she 's figured out some new way to make a dollar ! " But I was not thinking of Miss Nesselrode , nor of my father ; I was just thinking of how wonderful it was to be riding west into a new land , and to be sleeping under the stars . My last thought was not of that warm and sunny place called Los Angeles , it was of my grandfather , the one who had my father killed and who created the fear with which I lived .  | The night was clear and cold , with many stars . The wind off the sea was fresh when we rode down to the water 's edge . Out upon the water we could see lights from a dark hulk beneath bare poles , a ship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We 're ridin ' into town like I met you here as you come off the boat . We 'll stay the night down here at the harbor . " He turned his horse and rode toward a shack that stood hack from the water 's edge near a small dock where two boats were tied up . There was a corral beside the house , with two horses already there . A single light was burning in the shack , and Jacob rapped on the door without dismounting . " Who 's there ? " " Jacob . It 's Jake Finney , Cap . " The door opened and a square-shouldered old man stared from him to me . " Is this the young rascal who sailed around from Bedford with me ? " " Yes , sir , " I said , " and a fine voyage it was , too , except I ( n. that bit of rough weather off the Horn . " The old man stared at me , and then he smiled . " Well ! lie 's got a quick tongue , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go with it . " " I liked stopping at the Galapagos , " I said , enjoying it , " and the turtles we took aboard there . " The captain glared at me . " Who did you say this lad was , Jacob ? " " Zachary Verne 's boy . Grandson of old Adam Verne , if you remember .  | " Remember ? How could I forget him ? My first two voyages to the Pacific were made with him . Adam Verne 's grandson , eh ? Well , I 'll be damned ! " He took his pipe from his mouth . " Where 's your pa , boy ? I knew him well ? " " He 's gone , sir . Passed away . Murdered , actually . " " That 's why the trickery , Cap . The lad 's in danger . They believed they 'd done for him , too . " " Then why risk it , lad ? Come aboard my ship and you can sail to China . I 'll sign you on as cabin boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a ship 's master like your grandpa . " " Thank you , sir , but I am expected in Los Angeles . " " Miss Nesselrode will see to his education , Cap . She promised Zack Verne she 'd do that . " " Nesselrode , eh ? Well , I 'd not say it of another woman I know , but if she intends to see after the lad , it will be done . If there 's ever a woman should wear pants , it 's she . " It would be a pity , sir , lovely as she is . " " Eh ? Oh , yes , of course . She 's a handsome woman . That 's the trouble , Jacob , dealing with a handsome woman is unsettling to a man . When he should have his mind on business , he 's thinkin ' of other things . " He stepped back . " Come in , lad . You an ' me can talk some while Jacob puts up the horses . " It was a long , low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neatly made up . Directly ahead was a table and two benches , and on the left side a fireplace with a small fire going . " The bunks are clean . No bugs , I mean . You pick whichever suits you and dump your gear . " He seated himself at the table and reached down to the hearth for the coffeepot . " You drink coffee , lad ? I do n't think much of it for young folks , but there 's nothing else hot . " " I 'll have a bit , sir . Just a bit . " The captain knocked the ash from his pipe on the edge of the hearth and began to stoke it anew . " Knew your pa , but your grandpa better . They were good men , good men . " He struck a match and sucked on the pipe . " Your  | pa was killed ? Must have taken some doin ' , as I remember him . He was a fightin ' man when need be . " " There were several of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the way . He got at least one of them , wounded another , I think . " " That 's like him . There was no quit to him , but always a thoughtful man . " The captain puffed at his pipe and glanced at me from quizzical blue eyes . " If you an ' Miss Nesselrode do n't hit it off , lad , you just be on the beach next time I come to port . You 'll be welcome aboard . You 've the sea in your blood , and I 'll see you 've a chance . " " Thank you , sir . " " That Miss Nesselrode , now . Jacob tells me you came west on the wagon with her . She get a case on your pa ? " " I do n't think so , sir . I think she liked him , maybe felt sorry for him . He was very sick , you know . " " A takin ' woman . Make some man a fine wife if he was up to it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of himself to cope with her . " She 's a pretty woman , lad , and pretty women sometimes can do things no man would attempt . Mighty few men will say no to a pretty woman , no matter what she 's after . " Talked with her some . She come aboard , maybe two years or more ago , said she wanted to talk . Well , now , that old ship of mine is no lady 's boudoir . She 's a workin ' vessel , shipshape an ' neat , but no comforts , mind you . " No matter . She come aboard , drank coffee with me , and asked if I was Bailin ' to China . " To China ? No such idea entered my head . I was buying cargo , selling what I brought , and contemplating another voyage to Hawaii , maybe . " China , she says , so I ask her why I should go to China . She smiles very nice  --  she 's got a lovely smile , that lady  --  and says to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ otter . " I tell her I do n't have any such skins and she gives me that smile and says , ' But I do , Captain . I have three hundred and forty-two otter skins , some beaver , marten , and two hundred cowhides. '  | " Lad , I was flabbergasted . Here was this handsome young woman who should be settin ' at tea with some other young ladies , tellin ' me she had all those skins for sale " Next thing I know is , I 'm makin ' a deal to sail to China . I warned her there was risk . She said she understood that . ' Nothing is gained without some risk , Captain . ' " We talked a bit and she asked questions , very sharp questions about markets , products , and shipping matters . I tell you , lad , there 's a shrewd woman ! " Jacob came in , chose a bunk , and then came over to the table . " Weather changing , " he commented . " We 're in for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He paused . " Cap , have you heard any talk about war with Mexico ? Nobody out here knows anything , but some men came through from Texas who say there 's a lot of hard feeling . " " I 've heard rumors . What 's the feeling here ? " Jacob chuckled . " These are good people , Cap . Goodnatured . They want no trouble with anybody , but right now they have closer ties with us than with Mexico . They want to be known as Californios and only that . Push ' em , and they 'll fight ... there 's always cuttings and shootings among the rougher crowd in Sonora Town ... but mostly the people here just want to go their own way . If it comes to trouble with Mexico , I believe California would stay out of it unless some hothead starts trouble . If it becomes a matter of honor , the Californios will fight . " " Their trade is mostly with the States , " the captain commented , " and I hear complaints about governors appointed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " They want a California man for governor , " Jacob said , " and you ca n't blame them . It takes too long to get word back and forth from Mexico City , and some of their rulings do n't make sense here . These are good people , . Let them alone and they 'll be all right . " " They wo n't be let alone , Jacob . You know that . It is too rich a country . Jedediah Smith showed the way across the desert and mountains . Ewing Young and his party  | got through also , and there have been others . They were just a beginning . " Far into the night they talked , often of things my father and mother had discussed . Everything about California , that mysterious place of menace , had fascinated me , yet finally I fell asleep , curled in my bunk . When I awakened , Jacob had already saddled the horses . " Sleep well ? There 's a place up on the trail where we 'll breakfast . " He stopped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hot chocolate . Figured you 'd like that for breakfast . " The captain , he went back to his ship last night . " Jacob pointed toward it . " He 's anchored about threequarters of a mile out . When the weather 's right , he can come right in over the bar , as he does n't draw more'n about nine feet . Someday folks will get busy and deepen that channel , and you 'll see ships in here , dozens of ' em . " Miss Nesselrode , she thinks this is going to be a big city . " " San Pedro ? " " Well , that or Los Angeles . Get aboard and we 'll get going . It 'll be nearly a day 's ride as it is , us stoppin ' to rat . We rode our horses up the slanting trail from the shore . When we reached the top of the rise , we could see another ship beating in toward the bay . " Now , do n't you be talkin ' about Miss Nesselrode an ' all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were storyin ' , because she kind of keeps it quiet . Womenfolks are n't supposed to be into what she is . " " Do n't people know ? " " Here an ' there . Don Abel Stearns knows . He 's maybe the richest man around . Owns a lot of land . There 's a kw others . . . men . " She 's canny . Nobody ever really sees her talkin ' business . Womenfolks would n't approve ; neither would most ul the men . I do some of it , but mostly it is just a word or two on social occasions . " The captain , he 's been out to China and Japan twice now . lie carries other goods , of course , but he does better  | with the furs he carries for Miss Nesselrode . Otter hides are much in demand there , for they are beautiful furs . " It was a canny thing , to begin with them , but a frightful risk , too . She could have lost it all , had the ship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trees ahead , and off to the left a much larger bunch , a sort of a wild forest of scrub oak and sycamore mingled with what they called chaparral , which was a kind of mixed growth of brush and small trees , all entangled . The trail skirted wide around it . " Bears , " Jacob said . " California 's grizzly country , an ' a grizzly ai n't afraid of nothing . Tackle a man soon 's he would a rabbit , but they eat mostly roots , berries , leaves , and suchlike . They 'll feed off dead animals , sometimes make their own kills  --  it depends on the bear . Grizzlies is notional . " We rode over a slightly rolling plain covered with sparse brown grass and patches of brush or trees . Ahead of us there was a low adobe building , some corrals , and a lean-to shed . The roof of the adobe was of red tile . " See that tile ? Injuns made it . Taught by the folks at the missions . The missions are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have gone back to the hills , most of them . There 's no tile to be had nowadays . " " How big is Los Angeles ? " " Oh , maybe fifteen hundred to two thousand . Varies some . A few years back , 1836 , I believe it was , they taken a census . Came to two thousand two hundred and twentyeight in the whole county , and more'n five hundred of them were tame Injuns . They figured there were forty-six foreigners , twenty-one of them considered to be Americans . " He turned his horse in through the gate and drew up at the hitching rail . " I do n't pay much mind to such things , but Miss Nesselrode , she wants to know everything . " Jacob dismounted . " Come along , Hannes . Out here folks eat breakfast at ten o'clock , usually , and what they call dinner at about three . Sometimes they eat supper , mostly they do n't . " I know these folks . Pablo wo n't be here , most likely .  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ irrigation ditch that runs through town . Isabel . . . that 's his wife .. . she 's a Mexican girl . Pablo 's Californio . " Let 's go in . Isabel feeds folks who come along and prob'ly makes as much as Pablo does . Maybe more . " It was cool and still in the stone-flagged room . There were three tables with benches beside them , and as we entered , a young woman came in . She was plump and quite pretty , with very large dark eyes . " Senor ! It is not often you come this way ! Would you be seated ? I have not much , but ... " She left the room , returning in a moment with hot chocolate and some tortillas . " Wait ! You like the quesadilla , senor , and you shall have it . " She paused , looking at me . " And you ? What would you like ? " " The same , " I said , embarrassed . It was not often that I talked to a woman . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I had drunk chocolate but once before this and liked it very much . When she returned with the quesadillas , she said , " You come from the sea ? " " He does " ? Jacob gestured to me . " I have just met him at the ship . He will live in Los Angeles and go to school there . " " Ah ? You have family ? " I shook my head . " Miss Nesselrode was a friend of his family . She asked me to meet him and bring him to her . " " She is very pretty , Miss Nesselrode , " Isabel said . " I wonder that she is unmarried . " Among the Californios , who often married at fourteen , an unmarried woman of thirty was a puzzle . Yet I had not read romances for nothing . Between bites of quesadilla I said , " He died . . . or was killed . I do not know . " Immediately she was all sympathy . Who understands a broken heart better than those of Spanish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was very young ?  | " She was in love , " I said solemnly . " He was very handsome . She thinks only of him . " When Isabel had gone to the kitchen , Jacob glanced at me from the corners of his eyes and said very softly , " Now , I never knew that before . " " Neither did I , but she will tell the story and they will have an answer that pleases them . Now they will understand and ask no more questions . " He grunted . " For a youngster no older than you are ? " " It is in many of the stories , and the Spanish are a romantic people . My father knew many of their songs , and so did my mother . They all seem to be of broken hearts and lost loves . I just said what is in the songs . " He chuckled . " Boy , you 're a caution ! You surely are ! " It was sundown when we came within sight of the town . It lay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ north there was a line of low hills ; on the east there were mountains . There was a river flowing near the town , and there were vineyards and many trees . Within the town itself the streets seemed to have no plan or system . The houses were mostly of adobe , flat-roofed and low , yet here and there was a larger frame house or an adobe of two stories . There was a government house and a church . Jacob Finney led the way through back streets to a pleasant house surrounded by a hedge of willows . The zanja ran close by . The house was of adobe with red tile on the roof . It seemed better built than many of the others . There was a corral behind the house , with several horses . " You go knock on the door , Hannes . Miss Nesselrode will be anxious to see you . I 'll put up the horses . " Hesitant , I stood in the yard , trying to straighten my clothes and brushing them with my hands . There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a rocking chair beside it . Slowly I walked up , and just as I lifted my hand to knock , the door opened and a young Mexican girl was standing there . She stepped back , showing me in , and Miss Nesselrode came to greet me , both hands outstretched . " Johannes ! After all this time ! Please come in ! "  | She stepped back and looked at me . " My ! You 've grown ! And what a handsome boy ! " I blushed , shifting from one foot to the other . " How do you do , ma'am ? " I asked . " Sit down , Johannes . I can see we 're going to have to get acquainted all over again . " She smiled suddenly , beautifully , and I found myself grinning at her . " Tell me , now , what have you been doing ? What is it like , this place where you 've been living ? " So I told her , slowly at first , then with increased confidence , about Agua @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of palms in the canyons , and the house itself . " A hot spring ? Tell me about it . " She had the girl bring us chocolate , and she asked many questions about the climate , the soil , what grew there , and who lived there . Later , I told her about my father 's murder and how I had been left in the desert . " I heard of that , " she said . " Johannes , we must be very , very careful ! Your grandfather is a very influential man . He is also very wealthy . He does not mix with people here , and particularly not with the Anglos , but there is little he would not know if he wished . The advantage we have is that usually he does not wish . " He must not see you . You look very much like your father , only you are darker . The Spanish blood , I expect . " She stood up suddenly . " It is late , and you must rest . Tomorrow we must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see what I can do . In the meanwhile , Hannes , is there anything you want ? " " Something to read ? " I asked , and then added , " And when someone goes back to my house , I 'd like to send some books back there . " " But why , when you are living here ? " So I told her about the house of Tahquitz and the unseen visitor who exchanged books with me . She sat down , hands clasped before her , elbows on her knees . " What a strange story ! Just think of it ! A monster who reads Scott and Bulwer-Lytton ! " " I do not know that he is a monster . I do not know who  | built the house , or who comes to get the books , or even if it is the same . . . person . " " How long ago was the house built ? " " Only five or six years ago , I think , but there was another house there , or some sort of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My father said very , very old . " " The Indians know nothing ? " " Who knows how much an Indian knows ? No Indian feels it necessary to tell what he knows about anything . They are good people , most of them , but they think differently than we do . " " You 've learned a lot , Johannes . " " No , ma'am . I 've learned a little , but I know there is so much more . My father always said that was the wonderful thing about learning , that there was no end to it . " The Mexican girl came in from the kitchen . " Senorita ? " " Yes ? " " There 's a man over there , hiding in the willows across the street . He watches the house . " " Thank you . " She glanced at me . " You are not afraid , are you ? " " No , ma'am . " She smiled at me . " You want to know something , Johannes ? I am not afraid , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I never knew her to raise her voice or make a violent movement . Her dresses were simple , of gray or brown , in the lighter tones . Invariably , when she left the house , she carried a parasol . She smiled often , but her smiles were of several kinds , and I learned to know them . Of who she was or what she had been , she never said , nor did she ever speak of her plans or what she expected of life . When she came to California she had a little money . Far less money than most believed , although how much that was , I never knew , and I believe I knew more than anyone . It was very little . She met people easily , and they liked her . In the times of trouble , she was always ready to help , and seemingly always knew what to do . Invariably she took charge , quietly , efficiently , and without seeming to be in charge . She had what my father would have called a wellordered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed to have an ability to isolate a problem and examine it without anything else intruding , and above all , she could make decisions . She would have been a highly successful gambler . Indeed , that is probably what she was : at first she must always have gambled ; later , only on occasion . She seemed tall . Even when I grew to my full height , she seemed tall . Men always looked at her , at first with hardly concealed excitement , then with respect . I believe that in the first year she was proposed to two dozen times , and often by men of wealth and power , but of that  | I only heard through gossip or the talk of the girl who worked for her . She had at once hired a girl . Wages in California were very low , but she looked carefully at a number of girls before she asked one to work for her . In the meantime , she hired Jacob Finney . I believe she had spoken to him before the wagon arrived in Los @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she stayed for the first few days . Jacob liked California and had commented once that he thought of settling there . Somebody asked him how he would make a living , and he said he was not sure , but he would find something . She hired him for twenty-five dollars a month . It was as much as he would have earned as a cowhand in Texas , probably more than he expected . " What am I to do ? " he had asked . " Do as you please , but be there when I need you , and I will need you often . Above all , " she had added , " I want a man who does not talk . I want you to say nothing of what we are doing , but not to seem mysterious in any way . " First , she had him buy horses for herself and for him . Then she had him buy two cows for milking and some chickens for eggs . He planted some trees , tended some flowers , and he listened . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he told her what was happening in the City of the Angels and what people were talking about . She wanted the talk from the cantinas , from the saloon in the Bella Union , and from the corrals . She wanted most of all to know who was doing what when it came to buying , selling , or investing . She listened , and she visited . She attended fandangos , but rarely danced . She drank coffee with the women , listened to them talk . She watched the handsome young Californios ride into town in their magnificent suits , some of which cost several thousand dollars , and often astride saddles worth as much or more . After her early moves buying up sea otter skins from trappers she continued to buy more . She bought bearskins  | and other furs . She bought hides . In none of this did she appear or seem to have a hand . It was always Jacob , although often she sat a horse nearby and listened . They had signals by which they communicated , and when she felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time I came from the desert , she had bought an old adobe to use as a warehouse . She had also managed to buy several acres of land on the edge of the town . These she had planted to orange trees and grapes . On the second day I was there she had me read to her . When I had read for a time , we talked about the story . She had many questions , but it was mostly fun talk , about the people , their clothes , their horses . And for the next few days we talked a lot , about Ivanhoe , Robinson Crusoe , Robin Hood , things of which I had read or which I had learned from my father . She was , I know now , trying to judge my education , if it could be so called . " Do you remember Thomas Fraser ? " she said one day . " Yes , ma'am . He was the man who took notes when we came west . " " That 's the one . He is here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he has started a small school . I thought we might send you there . Although he knows your true identity I believe it would be worth taking that risk since I think he would be a good teacher for you . " " Yes , ma'am . " A thought came to me . " What happened to Mr. Fletcher ? " Her expression changed ever so slightly . " He is here . I see him occasionally on the street , but he goes to San Francisco quite often . " " I did n't like him . " " Nor did I. And I like him no better now . He is a gambler at least part of the time . Avoid him , Hannes . " Later , when we were alone , I asked Jacob about him . " Yeah , he 's around . He 's a bad one , boy , a real bad one . Ik 's become a sort of leader for a small group of thugs , but so far he 's done nothing anybody could catch him at . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment ,  | both hands resting on the horse . " Your grandpa does n't come to town too often . Only time he 's seen much is ridin ' to his house in town . Always has six to eight vaqueros with him ... tough men . " Rides a black stallion , big , fine-lookin ' horse , and the old man can ride . Has to , if he handles that animal , and he does . Believe you me , he does . " Keep out of his sight . You look like your pa , but something like your mother , too , or so the Indians say . Ai n't likely he 'll see you . He pays no attention to anyone , seems like , but you never know . " Miss Nesselrode was interested in the desert , and she asked many questions about my life there and how I had lived . " You must remember not to speak of it , " she warned again . " Although the chances are the subject will never come up . To Angelenos the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing of it at all . Nor are they interested . " That is part of the trouble , " she added . " This is their world and sometimes they seem to think there is no other . Unhappily for them , there is another world and it is filled with acquisitive people . " When a Californio wants money , he wants it now , and he will pay for it . They do not seem to grasp the workings of compound interest , and they have always bartered for things and there has always been plenty of land , plenty of cattle . They are nice people , but they can not seem to understand there may come a time when it is all gone . " " Do you lend them money ? " " Yes , and I have warned them . They smile and thank me very pleasantly , but I am a woman and they are merely tolerating me . " They borrow money and the interest is compounded monthly . When the notes fall due , no effort is made to collect because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Finally the borrowers have to give up thousands of acres of land , to pay for comparatively small loans . " She paused . " Thomas Fraser will be your teacher . You read very well , better than most adults whom I know ,  | and you write well . Now you must learn to cipher , and you must learn something of geography . Our world today is growing small . At any time some faraway country may become important to you , to your country , and to your business . Above all , you must learn to be a good citizen , and that means you must learn how your government works and how to go about getting things done , either in government or business . " The one thing we know , Hannes , is that nothing remains the same . Things are forever changing , and one must understand the changes and change with them , or be lost by the way . " You have come into this world with good health and a good mind . The rest is up to you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not get up at once , but lay abed thinking . My enemy was here , close by . A man had been watching our house .... Why ? Had it something to do with me ? Or with Miss Nesselrode ? When it came to that , who was she ? Why was she willing to take me in , send me to school , have me in her home ? Was it kindness ? Respect for my father , and pity for him and for me ? Or was it loneliness ? Or was there some other reason of which I did not know ? The reading of stories causes one to wonder about motives , but I could think of no reason why a small boy would be useful , but many ways in which he might be a trouble or at least an inconvenience . While dressing , I thought of school . I wanted to go to school , yet I did n't . I had known very few children of my own age , and none very long . Francisco had been the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved often , and my few ventures into schoolrooms had not been pleasant . Other children taunted me . Said I spoke like an old man . Teachers were sometimes flattering , more often irritable , usually wary . My father and mother had taught true many things , had read to me from books usually read only by older people . In some ways I knew much more than my teachers ; in others I knew less than any of the children . My teachers often realized how widely I had  | read and were nervous because of it . I did not want it so . I wished only to learn , and to be friendly . " Today , " Miss Nesselrode said at breakfast , " we will buy some clothing for you . " " I have money , " I said . " How much ? " " One hundred and seven dollars . My father left it for me . " " Keep it , Johannes , and say nothing about it to anyone . There are men in this town who would rob @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed to be considering , and then she said , " Perhaps we will invest a little of it for you , along with something of mine . It is never too soon to learn how to handle money . " Many people know how to get money , but few know how to keep it . Wise investments are always based on information , Johannes , so the more you know , the better . The women know much more of what is going on than their men realize , although most women are simply not interested . Sometimes when we are among ourselves , they talk of such things , and I can learn who is buying , who is selling , and what the city officials are about to do . " Often men talk to me , wishing to impress me with how much they are doing and how important their activities are . I listen , Johannes , and I remember . " When you are a man , remember to tell no one of what you are doing unless you wish it to be known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relating it all to another man . She looked at me suddenly . " Johannes ? What do you wish to be ? What would you like to become ? " I did not know , and I told her so , but the question worried me . Should I know ? " There is time , " she said , " but the sooner you know , the sooner you can plan . To have a goal is the important thing , and to work toward it . Then , if you decide you wish to do something different , you will at least have been moving , you have been going somewhere , you will have been learning .  | " What did your father do ? I mean , how did he make a living ? " I did not know . He had taught school for a while . I know for a time he had worked for a newspaper . We had moved often , for even in the East there had been attempts to kill him . Or he thought there were . Yet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done , but there were other times when he had traded in horses , when he bought and sold things . " With what , I wonder ? Johannes , your father worked at things that paid but little money , yet you seem to have lived well , and you traveled . He paid for your trip west . Three hundred dollars for him , one hundred for you . It is quite a lot . Can you remember nothing else ? " She seemed to have an idea . " Was there no one he went to ? Or some place to which he returned from time to time ? " I could remember none . Of course , I had been very young , and of those years there were only memories of places and people here and there . From the years , I could recall only brief moments , none of which seemed important . Although Miss Nesselrode had said we were to buy clothing for me , yet we went to no stores . She always took a walk each day , and on this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be coming to take my measurements . " You are tall , " she said , " and we must leave no clues , so we will lie a bit about your age . You will tell people you are twelve . It is a small lie and will turn away speculation if your grandfather should hear of you . " In any case , " she added , " there is no connection between your father and me . " " Except the wagon , " I said . " Yes . . . " She paused , considering . " There is that . "  | The room was long and low , with two windows that looked across the zanja into an orchard . On the other side there was one window which looked toward an empty corral . Inside the room there were two tables and four benches . There was a smaller table at the far end , and a chair where Thomas Fraser sat . He arose when we entered the room . " Miss Nesselrode ? How good to see you again ! And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Johannes Vickery . I hope you will find him a good student . " " The classes are for four hours only . You understand , ma'am ? I have my own work , and can afford no more time . " " That is understood . I believe you will find him eager to learn . You have how many students now ? " " Only five at the moment . Three young ladies and two young men . Johannes will be the sixth . " " Very well . Tomorrow , then ? " " Eight o'clock . . . here . " He followed us into the yard . He had always been thin . He was thinner now . " It has been good to see you , ma'am . It was an adventure we shared , one that can not be forgotten . I would never have believed ? " She smiled beautifully . " It is all very well , Mr. Fraser , but a time that is past . Teach Johannes what you can . None of us might be here were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see Mr. Farley , he assures me that is true . He says he never saw a man shoot so unerringly , so coolly . " " He is a good man , " she told me later , " and no doubt he will write well , but if he is to make a living , he must do more than write . His book must sell , also . " " But surely the stores will do that ! " " No doubt they will carry a few copies of his book , as my store will do , but why should they be bought ? What is to make somebody come to that store and buy his book , of all that are available ? He must give them a reason . He must somehow excite their interest , and then the book must hold that interest . " We walked along the street , sometimes on walks made of boards but more often of hard-packed earth or even of sand . Here and there flat rocks had been placed to make the walking easier when there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a general store and a saddle shop , and the books on the shelves were few . There were newspapers and magazines , and she always had coffee on the stove . " We will be having more books at any moment now . They were ordered long since . " She removed her hat and placed it beside her parasol . " You can help me here , Johannes . Look about and see what we have . " " You sell books ? " " Of course , but this is also a reading room . Men come to read the newspapers , to talk business and politics . One can learn a great deal that is useful just by listening . " It is also a place where people can meet me , although , as you will see , Mr. Finney does most of my business for Inc . " She smiled suddenly , her eyes filled with mischief . " After all , what would a mere woman know about business and politics ? A wise woman in these days will listen in wide-eyed innocence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refrain from comment . " You should n't tell me this , " I protested , grinning at her . " I shall someday be a man , and I will know what you do . " And by then it will have been done , Johannes . In the meantime , listen , learn , and say nothing . Remember , no  | matter what you do or what you become , you will also have to do business . It is the way of the world , Johannes , so learn what you can now . " Later she commented , " In the course of a week , every man of importance will come in . At first it was the Anglos and Europeans , now the Californios come as well . " " And my grandfather ? " " He does not read . He can , but he does not . There are many who assume that once they have become men there is nothing to be learned from books . " Standing by the door , I could watch people passing in the street : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vaquero in a buckskin suit and broad sombrero , riding a dun-colored horse ; a Mexican woman selling panocha , the dark Mexican sugar candy of which I had heard from Francisco . A passing carreta was pulled by a burro who seemed too small for the task . At sundown we closed the shop and walked home through streets rapidly growing empty as people went to their homes . One man paused , removed his sombrero with a broad silver band , and told Miss Nesselrode of a fandango that was being arranged , and would she come ? When we had gone on , she said , " That was Senor Lugo . He is of an old family here , with much land . He knows your grandfather . " " They are friends ? " " No , I do not believe so . Your grandfather does not seem to make friends , nor care to . He is known , respected , and sometimes feared , but he does not make friends . " " He came from Spain . " " So it is said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " My mother said he came from Spain long ago , when she was a very small girl . He was given land by the king . He was a very important man in Spain , and very rich . " " I wonder why he chose to come to California ? He does not seem the type for adventure , and if he had a strong position in Spain , why would he give it all up to come here , to this outpost ? " My father and mother had talked of this , and they had also been puzzled .  | " Was your mother the only child ? " " I do not know . Sometimes I think ... No , I do not remember . " Yet I did remember something . . . something . . . What ? Now that the question had arisen , I tried to discover a reason why a man of wealth and position would abandon it all and come here . California was delightful , but far from the centers of power . Where had I heard that ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much of her family , and I could see in her much of the fierce pride the old hidalgos had , pride of family , pride of name , and of person . Yet too often , it seemed to me , such pride was founded upon events of long ago , or just upon the family 's continued existence . Once , seated in the wagon , I asked my father how such families came to be . What had they done ? " Very often , " he said , " he who founded the family would not be received in any of their homes now . The founder was often a peasant , a poor soldier or sailor , an adventurer with a strong arm and a sword who carved his way to wealth and position . " Usually he was a man of strength , courage , and acquisitive instincts who rode in the entourage of a king or great lord and was given estates as a reward for services in the field or court . " There were few cities then , and everything centered around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expected to furnish so many fighting men . Shoes , clothing , everything necessary was made by craftsmen at the castle . The only way for a young man to escape from being a serf was with a sword . By courage in battle you might win a name for yourself . There were no shops then , or craftsmen outside the castle , and if you did not own land , your only chance of success was that sword I spoke of . " II ' you did not belong to a castle , you were a landless ratan , which meant you belonged nowhere , were fair game lot ' anyone , and almost an outlaw . Some such men became wandering traders . Later some settled down to practice their trade or craft , and towns  | came into being . That 's roughly the way it began , in Europe , at least . " Another day , when the newspaper readers had gone , we closed the shop and I walked home beside Miss Nesselrode . " It is a very small town , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ driving goats pass before us , " but it will not remain small . " " How can you be sure ? " " It has the sea close by , it has many thousands of cattle , almost anything will grow , and the climate is perfect . It will surely become a great city . " Above all , " she said as we crossed the street , " it has men like Don Benito Wilson , William Wolfskill , the Workmans , and others . They are forward-looking men . " Do not forget , Johannes . It is men who make a town , and bigger men who make a city . " " I have known one , " I said , " and you met him , too . Peg-Leg Smith . " She smiled . " You know , Johannes , he was an old scoundrel , I think , but I did like him . " " He liked you , too , " I said , and told her about his finding me in the desert . " During the next few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future . What do you want to be ? What do you want to become ? " To succeed as a human being is not always the same as succeeding in your life 's work , although they can go hand in hand . " You are alone , or almost alone , but that can make you stronger , for you will not be inclined to lean on anyone . You have enemies , but that can be an advantage . Enemies can be an incentive to survive and become someone in spite of them . Enemies can keep you alert and aware . " We ate a small supper , quite late . " You read a great deal , Johannes , so you can be a help to me in the store . " " I 'd like to help . " " Good ! We will think about that . In the meanwhile , tomorrow you begin school . " The room in which I slept was small , with a narrow bed and two windows . There was a chest in which to  | keep clothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with water . On the floor were two rag rugs . The walls were bare , of plastered and whitewashed adobe . Lying in bed that night , I worried . At no time had school been pleasant for me , although I had an abiding interest in learning . Wherever I 'd gone to school , I 'd come in after all the others were settled in and knew each other . I 'd come along late and would know nobody and frequently I was one of the youngest in the school . They knew about the same things and the same people . They could talk about them . I did n't know any of those things , and none of the people , and I 'd lived in different places and mostly I 'd talked with older folks or been talked to by them . Usually a strange boy in school was teased . Often he had to fight , and twice I got licked . Once we fought until we were both tired out and it was kind of even up , although I had a bloody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my clothes and I had n't any others . Each time a day was over , I was glad to go home . I said nothing to my parents , and except the time when I was bloody , they did not know about the fights . That time Papa took me out back and tried to show me something about fighting . He did n't show me much , but it helped . " Most boys in schools , " Papa said , " hit for the face . Keep your hands up , and when you can , hit ' em in the belly . " Later he said , " These are rough boys . If they push or shove you , do n't talk , do n't call names , do n't argue . Hit them first , and hard . " I did , and it worked . It worked on that same boy who gave me the bloody nose . He shoved me and I swung a backhanded blow and hit him in the belly , knocking his wind out . Before he could fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had the bloody nose . Now I had it to do again . There were two boys , and I cou i Id he sure one of them would think he was something blr . Miss Nesselrode , I was afraid , would not look kindly upon fist fighting .  | Nowhere in Los Angeles was far from anywhere else in those days . The school was only about three or four minutes ' walk from Miss Nesselrode 's , and it was a little before eight o'clock when I showed up . Two boys and two girls were sitting on benches outside , but not together . They all looked up when I came into the yard , but nobody said anything . One of the boys was bigger than me , both taller and heavier , and he was older , too , 1 thought . " What do you want here ? " he demanded aggressively . " I am going to school . " " Supposin ' I said I would n't let you ? " This was the beginning of trouble which I did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away from it , not in all cases . I walked toward him . He had not expected that , and it bothered him a little . " Mr. Fraser knows me . He expects me this morning . " " 01 ' Fraser does n't run things out here . He runs things in the schoolroom . I run ' em in the yard . " I said nothing , I simply waited . My heart was pounding heavily . Big as he was , I did not think he was any stronger than some of the Indian boys with whom I had wrestled . " Who are you , anyway ? I never saw you before . " " I have just come from the sea . I came around the Horn in a Boston ship . " The other boy was fascinated . " Around the Horn ? Gee ! " " My name , " I said , " is Johannes Vickery . " " That ai n't so much , " the big boy said . " Anybody can come around the Horn . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was lying . I had not come around the Horn , but there was need to establish my story . Miss Nesselrode had told me that , and so had Jacob Finney . At that moment Thomas Fraser turned into the yard from the street . " Good morning , Johannes . I see you have met Rad Huber . And this " ? he indicated the smaller boy ? " is Philo Burns . " The young ladies , " he said , " are Della Court and Kelda O'Brien . " He glanced around . " Where is Meghan ? "  | " She 's coming . " It was the girl called Della who answered . " She was expecting her father to come in . " Fraser glanced at me . " Her father is Captain Laurel , of the Queen Bess , " he explained . We went inside and took seats at the table . The others had seats occupied before I arrived , and I waited until they were seated , then sat down . " That 's where Meghan sits , " Rad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , and moved over one space . " You go sit at the other table , " Rad ordered . " Where he 's sitting will be quite all right , " Fraser said , and Rad shifted irritably , started as if to speak , then subsided , muttering . " This morning , " Fraser said , " we will continue with the study of inflection and emphasis in the spoken language . " That was how my school days began .  | For three days I attended school , and each day the seat beside me was empty . On the fourth day , Rad Huber stopped me in the yard as I approached the school . He stood squarely in front of me , feet spread apart . Philo Burns stood at one side , but the girls had not yet come to school . Or I did not see them . " Meghan 's coming back to school today , " Rad said . " You move to that other table . " " Mr. Fraser told me where to sit . I shall stay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move or I 'll move you ! " " I do not know Meghan , " I said , " but I shall stay where I am . He struck me . I was not expecting it , and he knocked me down . Dazed , I sat on the ground , and when I put my hand to my mouth , there was blood on it . Angry , I started up , and he hit me again before I got to my feet , knocking me down again . Rolling over , I tried to get up , and he kicked me in the ribs . Time and time again I tried to rise ; each time , he kicked me or knocked me down . Stunned , bleeding , and hurt , I kept trying . I did not know why I kept trying , but something inside me drove me to it . One of the girls was crying . " Rad ! You leave him alone ! " " Come on , Rad ! Leave him be ! " Philo demanded . " Shut up ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smart ! I 'll show him ! " Again I started up , and when I was on my hands and  | knees , he kicked me in the ribs . I gasped painfully , but struggled to get up . " See ? " Rad sneered . " He ai n't so much ! Just a big baby ! " He backed off and turned away , and I struggled up , then rushed at him , swinging both fists . Somebody yelled , and Rad turned . One of my flailing fists caught him in the mouth , cutting his lip , but then he pushed me away and rushed at me , swinging both fists . He was larger , and had longer arms . He hit me again and again . Suddenly Mr. Fraser was there . " Here , here ! What 's going on ? Rad , stop that ! Leave him alone ! " " Hah ! He had it coming ! " He walked away . Slowly , painfully , I got up and tried to brush off my clothes . Thomas Fraser @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he asked . " No , " I lied . " Wash your face , then , and come to school . " There was a washbasin on a shelf around the corner from the schoolroom door . I washed the blood and dust from my face and dried it on the towel . I felt sore and stiff . Limping , I went into the school . Rad turned , sneering at me . Walking over , I sat down in my usual place . Rad started up , but Mr. Fraser said , " Rad ! Sit down ! " " You tell him to move , or I 'll move him ! " " I shall do no such thing . If there is any more of this , I 'll dismiss you from school . " " Flab ! " Rad said . " You 'll do no such thing . Pa paid for the term , and you try dismissing me . Pa would be down here to see you . He 'd be down mighty quick ! " Meanwhile , I opened my books @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me but said nothing . His face was pale and he was angry . Perhaps he was frightened , too . His existence depended on the school , and I suspected he had n't the money to return to Rad 's father if he dismissed him . Rad glared at me , but subsided . He opened his books ;  | then he whispered , " You wait until school 's out ! You just wait ! " Something fell from my lips to the slate . It was a drop of blood . I wiped it off , staring bitterly at the place where it had fallen . What was I to do ? He would beat ' me and kick me again when school was out . Nobody would stop him . Still dazed , I hung my head over my slate and felt like crying , but I did not cry . I would not give him the satisfaction . Somehow , I would .. . He could hit very hard . He would hit me again and again . He would kick me . " Hit them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but Rad 's arms were too long . I knew so little about fistfighting , but I had wrestled with the Indian boys . I could throw them all , except Francisco , and once in a while I could throw him . When Mr. Fraser called on me to read from the story of William Tell , I almost did not hear him . Then I stood up and read . Slowly , because of my swollen lips , but I read well . " Very good , Johannes , " Mr. Fraser said . " Hah ! " Rad sneered . Seated again , I scarcely listened to what was happening . I was thinking , thinking hard , and I was scared . I did n't want to be hit again . I did not want to take a beating and have them all seeing me lying in the dust . I had to do something . One thing I knew . I was not going to move . I did not know Meghan . I did not care to know Meghan , but I was not going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would stay right where I was . Yet , what could I do ? Something ... My father used to say there was always a way . There was an answer to everything . If I could only .. . Maybe .. . Soon the class would break up and I must go outside again . Thomas Fraser might protect me here , but away from the school he could do nothing . There was movement at the door , and I looked up .  | She stood just inside , the sunlight touching her hair . It was red-gold . She was slender , graceful as a willow , and beautiful . This was Meghan . . . and I was in love .  | She paused for a moment in the doorway , the sunlight on her red-gold hair . Then she crossed the room and sat down beside me . Automatically I arose , stepping back for her . She gave me a quick smile and I trembled . She seated herself and I sat down beside her . The edge of her dress brushed my trouser leg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our new student , Mr. Vickery , has just read a part of William Tell . You might read the conclusion , up as far as the shooting of the apple . " She read easily , beautifully , in a low , well-modulated tone , but I did not look up . My eyes remained riveted to the lines , although scarcely seeing them . I was conscious of a faint perfume , fresh , flowerlike . When I did look up , Rad was glaring at me , and I felt myself go sick and empty . He would attack me again , as he had threatened . He would beat me , and I would go down in the dust again , as before . Only now it would be different . She would be there . She would see it . She would think me contemptible . In fear and agony I waited for the class to be over . Jacob Finney was coming by for me with my horse . We were riding out to the tar pits along the old Indian trail . As I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gasped . " Oh , your poor face ! What happened ? " " It was a fight . I think there will be another now . " " Rad ! It was Rad , was n't it ? "  | " Yes . " " He should be ashamed of himself ! Picking on someone smaller than himself ! " " He 's not so big . " We had started toward the door , but as I stepped back to allow her to go through the door ahead of me , a hand grasped my shoulder and I was shoved aside . Rad stepped into my place and moved up beside her . Now I was angry . Out in the yard he started walking away beside her . He had brushed me aside as if I were nothing . Inside me there was cold fury . I fought it down . " What 's the matter ? " I called after him . " Are you scared ? " He stopped abruptly and turned around . They all did , even Mr. Fraser , who stopped in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scared of you ? " He put down his books and started toward me . Now you 're in for it , I told myself . Do n't let him hit you . Wrestle ! He was larger in every way , and much heavier , but how much did he know ? He had his fists up ready to strike , and mine were up too ; then suddenly I dove , grasping his ankle with both hands and throwing my weight against his knee as I jerked up on the ankle . He toppled over on his back . Instantly , holding his ankle in my right armpit , I stepped across his body , half-turning him toward the ground . Then I dropped to a sitting position on his buttocks , lacing the opposite way . The Indians had taught me this , and I knew I had only to put more pressure on his ankle and his hip would be dislocated . I leaned back a little , and he cried out . Fraser had alined and was coming toward us . Out on the street Jacob @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He sat his saddle , watching . Meghan stood with the other girls , their faces showing excitement and shock . " Let him up ! " Mr. Fraser ordered .  | " Ask him first if he will let me alone . I want no more trouble . " " Will you let him alone , Rad ? " Fraser asked . " I 'll kill him ! " I leaned back again , and this time he screamed . Then he said , " No ! No ! Get off me ! I wo n't do nothin ' ! " Letting go , I got up . Rad lay still for a moment , then got up painfully . Wary , I backed off . " Now , that 's quite enough ! " Fraser spoke sharply . " We 'll have no more of this ! Any more trouble between you , and I shall dismiss you both , do you understand ? " " 1 never wanted trouble , " I said . Rad glowered but said nothing . Meghan glanced at me , then turned her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Kelda . Turning to Mr. Fraser , I said , " I am sorry , sir . I wanted no trouble . " When I reached my horse , Jacob looked at my face . " Looks like you taken a few , " he said . " That was earlier . His arms are too long . " " You done all right , seemed to me . Where 'd you learn that fancy stuff ? " " From the Indian boys . They wrestle all the time . " " Feller downtown . Man I know . He 's pretty good with his mitts . He 's boxed in New Orleans , New York , an ' London . We got to get you with him . You fight that boy again an ' he may n't let you get hold of him . Not if he 's smart . He 'll just stand off an ' punch your lights out . " We rode in silence for a few minutes and then he said , " This place we 're goin ' . They call it the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The water has oil in it , too , seems like . An ' gas . It bubbles right up through the water , the bubble floats a minute or two , then busts . Animals get stuck in it . Other animals an ' buzzards come there to feed on the ones that get trapped . " Folks hereabout , Injuns , Californios an ' such , they use the tar on their roofs . Use it to watertight their boats , too . The Chumash Injuns who live along the coast , they used it first .  | " The Chumash make mighty fine boats . Some carry eight to ten people , maybe more . They use tar along the seams to make the boats watertight . " They used to go out to the islands off the coast , to Catalina , Santa Barbara , an ' the like . The Chumash were right handy with boats , but they 're gettin ' fewer and fewer all the time . " He pointed off to his left . " Off down there 's a big cienaga @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down there and just spread out . Then about fifteen years ago she broke through to the sea an ' drained most of that . Still mighty good grazing land . Green grass and some water down there most of the time . The Californios have some of their roundups down thataway . " This trail runs all the way to the sea . There 's a bay along there , Santa Monica Bay . Not much protection , though , in bad weather . She 's too open . " Miss Nesselrode , she wants you to know the country around , and the folks . " " What 's off there ? " I pointed toward the mountains . " There 's the mountains , and over beyond , a wide valley . The pass they call the Little Door . The Injun name is Cahuenga . " There 's trails through most of the canyons . Just horse trails , mostly , but there are bears back in there , lots of them , and more than likely they wo n't get out of the way , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of there , ' less you want to fight . " " I heard there were bandits . " " Oh , sure ! Plenty of those . Some just steal horses , some raid lonely stations , murder travelers and the like . You got to be careful . " The day was warm and pleasant . All around us was u wide sweep of grassland dotted with clumps of oak gtrdd other brush , with here and there a small grove or a patch where someone was planting . Scattered cvervwhere , although not in great numbers , there were cattle . " Once in a while a man has to fight , " Jacob said , " but  | you avoid it if you can . Fightin ' attracts attention , and that 's the last thing you need . " This is a small town with not much to talk about . Fortunately the Californios do n't pay a lot of attention to us Anglos . There 's a few of us here , and although Stearns and a few others are doing well , they go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The old don keeps to himself , mostly . They say he thinks himself better than the others because he is of pure Castilian blood . Your grandmother has been dead for a good many years , so the old don 's house is run by his younger sister , the Dona Elena . " She runs a mighty fine house , or so they say . Stoneflagged floors ' n everything . I suspect there are n't more'n a half-dozen houses in town with anything but dirt floors . Out here folks make do with mighty little . Nothin ' fancy to be had . " Back t ' home my ma never had much to do with , but we lived better than these folks who have thousands of acres . The government does n't permit trade with anybody but themselves , although there 's a good deal of business done with the Boston ships . " " You mean , they 're not supposed to ? " " They got laws against it , but what 're these folks to do ? They are needful of things , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supposed to enforce the laws look the other way . " Jacob Finney drew up . " Back yonder , that 's Rancho Las Cienagas . I told you about the swampland . Francisco Avila owns that , and off to the northwest where those low hills are , that ranch is called Rodeo de las Aguas . Means ' the gathering of the waters , ' likely because of the springs . A widow woman owns that . Her husband was a soldier named Valdez . " La Brea , where we 're headed , that 's owned by a Portugee named Rocha . Good man . I helped his folks catch up some horses here a while back . Injuns had started to run them off an ' we had a bit of a set-to . " One of these times , you an ' me , we 'll take ourselves an  | outfit and ride off up the San Joaquin Valley . That 's over yonder . A long , long valley with herds of wild horses everywhere , two , three hundred in a bunch . Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no one ? " " That 's right . Wild as antelope or elk . Comes to that , I 've seen herds of over a thousand elk . Boy , that 's one you 've got to see ! Somethin ' to remember . " Tame , too . The Californios do n't hunt much . They have all the beef they want and they make do with that . Me , I like elk meat . It 's right tasty . " We rode on , lazy in the sunshine . Cattle moved out of our way or turned their heads to look at us with a total lack of interest . We were not chasing them , and they knew it . " There ! " Finney pointed . " See ? The trees yonder ? That dark pool ? That 's it . You got to ride careful , there 's several smaller patches of tar here an ' there . " He waved a hand . " Most anyplace here you can push a stick into the ground and it will come up black with tar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get tar to calk their boats . " See ? The bones yonder ? Something trapped there , buzzards fed off it , and maybe one of them trapped , too . If you set still and watch , you can see the gas bubble up . There ! See , yonder ? It bubbles up , the bubbles break , and after a bit , another one comes . " Water is n't fit to drink . Too much oil an ' stuff , but this here 's somethin ' to see . A few years ago a ship 's captain from down to San Pedro , he come out here to get tar and he found a tusk . Elephant 's tusk . " Anybody 'd told me , I 'd not have believed it , but there it was . " The Indians have stories about hunting them , " I said . " Not the Cahuillas , the Plains Indians . " " You do n't say ? That 's one I never heard . " " It was the Osage , I think , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ killed . " We left our horses cropping the grass and walked over to the pools , but not going too close . The trees Jacob had  | mentioned were actually some distance away , but grass grew right to the edge of the water in some places . The larger pool was at least an acre in extent . " It was larger when we were here the first time , " Jacob said , " but this has been a dry year . " He pointed out two more pools , each no larger than a washtub , and several places where grayish bulges of tar or asphalt had pushed up through the grass . " There are several oil springs around , " Jacob said . " Miss Nesselrode wanted to see them , so we rode over to take a look . Injuns and some of the Californios come there to get oil for some treatments they give themselves . " " It is a strange place , " I said . " I 'd like to come back again . " Reckon you can do about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk about that with Miss Nesselrode . I do n't know what she has in mind , but you can bet she 's figurin ' on something . That woman 's mind never sets still , believe me . " I like her . " " So do I , " Jacob agreed , " but let me warn you , although you are n't likely to need it . Do n't cross her . She 's almighty pleasant . She 's a fine-looking young woman with a lovely smile and all that , but there 's cuttin ' steel under it , and do n't you be forgettin ' it . " We mounted up and started back , and Jacob said , " She wants you to ride around over this valley and get acquainted with the locality . Do n't ask me why . Maybe she just wants to be sure you do n't get lost sometime . Knowin ' her , I 'd lay a good bit she 's got something else in mind . " We were unsaddling our horses when he spoke again . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I mean , could you make them understand ? " " Most of them spoke some Spanish . Francisco and his father know both Spanish and English . They know enough to get along , anyway . " " How about the Chumash ? " " It is a different language , I think . "  | " She wants you to learn it , Johannes . She 's got something in mind . " We started for the house , and Miss Nesselrode was standing in the door , waiting for me . I knew right away that something had happened . Something was wrong .  | Miss Nesselrode rested a hand upon my shoulder , but she spoke to Jacob . " Will you come in , Mr. Finney ? This is something you should know . " Her hand caressed the back of my head . " Johannes ? You have a visitor . A guest . " It was dusk and the candles had been lighted . Something in her tone seemed to warn me . In my right hand I held my rifle and pistol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without them . " You will not need those , Johannes . Come in , now . " She stepped aside to permit me to pass , then closed the door behind us . It was a moment not to be forgotten . The quiet room , the soft glow from the two candelabra , the old carved chest against the wall , the table , the chairs , the rag rugs upon the floor , and that tall , straight woman standing there , looking at me . Her hair was black , but white at the temples . She had allowed her rebozo to fall back to her shoulders . Her features were thin and what people called aristocratic . She was a beautiful and stately woman , no longer young , but a woman with presence , to whom years had brought added beauty . She had distinction , more than anyone I had known , perhaps more than anyone I would ever know . " Yes " ? her voice was low , very pleasant ? " of course ! How like them you are ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Johannes , I am your great-aunt , Elena . I have looked forward to this moment . "  | Great-aunt ? My mother spoke fondly of her Aunt Elena , but if she was my grandfather 's sister , she must be an enemy . Yet she did not seem like an enemy . Her smile made me want to draw closer . " I am Johannes . . . " I hesitated , then added , " Johannes Verne . " " I know . " She seated herself , yet even in that simple movement there was something regal . " May we talk a little , Johannes ? " She glanced at Miss Nesselrode . " You have been most kind . I have but little time . If he should call for me . . . at night I am almost never away . " " Of course . " Jacob came in quietly and took a seat on the far side of the room . " Please , Johannes , tell me of your mother . " My mother ? What could I say ? What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " I loved her very much , Johannes . She was like my own daughter . And I liked your father . Had it been up to me ... " She was beautiful , " I said , " like you . We were only three , and we were always together . She was very happy , I believe , except when she thought about home . She told me many stories of Spain , and stories of the sea voyage to California , and of the landing . " My father offered to take her back to California , but she was afraid for him . " " He was always a bold one . I think he feared nothing . Tell me . . . where did you live ? How did you live ? I want to know everything . " " We moved often . My father had gone to sea with his hither , who was a ship 's captain , as you would know , and ht had planned to become one himself . Yet he could not return to the sea without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " For a time he managed a livery stable in Philadelphia , anti later he trained horses and managed a big farm in Kentucky . Ile was a marshal in a Missouri river town before that . I do not know its name . I was only a baby Ihen , I guess .  | " Often he said he would like to find a permanent job so he could write . Mr. Longfellow , the poet , was also a professor , and Oliver Wendell Holmes was a physician . Mr. Emerson , I think , was a minister . Each had some way of living so he could write with freedom . " Many of the people who came to our house in Philadelphia were writers , like Mr. Lippard , who had long straggly hair and wore strange clothes . He lived in a big old ramshackle house of many rooms where all sorts of people lived . The house had been abandoned , I think , and they just moved in . " There was a Mr. Hirst , whom I saw only once or twice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think he was a writer , too . " Yes , I know he was because I remember Papa wondering what he might have written had everyone not wanted stories of ghosts , haunted houses , and tombs . Mr. Poe wrote what was wanted , like all of them . " Papa read me the stories of ' Rip Van Winkle , ' and about the ' Headless Horseman , ' and sometimes when Papa 's friends came around , Mama made coffee or tea for them . Mr. Poe liked to hear Papa talk about his years at sea when he was a boy , and he asked many questions . On one voyage Papa 's ship was blown far to the south when rounding Cape Horn , and they found themselves among icebergs and had a terrible time before they escaped . " Mama told stories , too , and one of them was about Boabdil , the Moor , who was sleeping in an enchanted cave with all his knights , awaiting the moment when he would awaken them to reconquer Spain . " " She sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It is not the custom . But they all insisted she be with them , for she knew so many stories . Some of them , I think , were stories you told her , for I remember she spoke of you sometimes . " Sometimes it became very late and they forgot I was not in bed , or maybe Mama just made believe she forgot , for she would say suddenly , ' Oh , how awful ! You should be in bed , young man ! ' But if the stories were very good , she would make believe to forget again .  | " There was one story that made her sad . It was a story about a monster ? " " A monster ? " " A woman named Mary Shelley wrote the story . Her husband was a poet , I think . It was a story about a student named Frankenstein who made a man out of pieces of dead people . People thought the creature a monster , but he was n't really . Mama always felt sorry for the monster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " For a moment there was silence in the room , and then Aunt Elena changed the subject . " You lived in Kentucky , you said ? " " A man who met Papa at the livery stable gave him the job of training horses for racing . He liked the way Papa cared for the horses , and he said all the trainers he wanted were already employed and if Papa could produce a winning horse he would give him a share of the winnings . " " Did he never talk of going to sea again ? " " Oh , no ! By that time Mama was sick and Papa wanted to get out of the city where the air was better . Once when we were alone he said we must be very good to Mama because she was more ill than she believed . Papa would not take any kind of work where he could not look in upon Mama often . " Once I heard him talk to Mr. Poe about it , for his wife was ill also . Both of them had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illness , whatever that is . People became pale and frail and all the doctors did was prescribe fine wines and special foods . " Papa said to Mama that he had no right to keep her where she was . He said , ' In California you would soon be well . We must go back . ' But Mama would not go . She said Papa would be killed . " He said , ' Do you think I would die so easily ? ' " ' No , ' she said , ' but you might kill him , and that would be just as bad . ' " Sometimes at night when they thought I was asleep they talked of me , worrying about what would become of me when they were gone , because by that time Papa was sick , too , and Mama knew it . After Mama died ? "  | " How long ago ? " " I was five , I think . I do not remember too well , but we lived in Kentucky then . " For several minutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , long , lovely days when we could look out over the green pastures with their white fences and the beautiful horses running and playing there . Mama talked to me an awful lot then . I think she wanted to tell me everything , before .. . Aunt Elena had sat very still , reaching for every word I spoke . Sometimes her eyes filled with tears , sometimes her lips trembled , but she said nothing , and did not interrupt . " Mr. Poe 's wife died , too , someone said . I do not know , only that after Mama died two of the horses Papa had trained won their races and the owner gave Papa a share , as he had promised . " It was a very damp , rainy year and Papa was worse , so he quit his job and we came west . " " I see . " Aunt Elena sat very still ; then she looked over at me . " Thank you , Johannes , for telling me . At least she was happy during those years . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She got to her feet . " I must go . Johannes , if you ever need me , please have Miss Nesselrode or Senor Finney come to me . In the meantime , you must be careful ! About him there is nothing I can do . We have had words about this . " As yet , he knows nothing . I would know if he did . Ile believes you dead . He even talks of returning to Spain . " You must keep out of trouble ! It was because of talk among the women about a fight at school that I heard of a boy named Johannes who was living at the home of Miss Nesselrode . I knew she had come west in the wagon with your father , and that Senor Finney had worked for Senor Farley on the same trip . " She started for the door , but Jacob got up suddenly . " Wait , ma'am . I 'll just take a look around outside first . " He was gone only a minute . " It 's all right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . "  | At the door Aunt Elena stooped suddenly and kissed me on the forehead ; then , embarrassed , she slipped out and disappeared in the darkness . Miss Nesselrode came up behind me and rested a hand on my shoulder . " I believe she loves you very much , Johannes , just as she loved your mother . " " She does not know me . " " She sees your mother in you . Tia Elena has no children , and your mother was like a daughter to her . Now it is you of whom she thinks . " " She is a nice lady . " " Yes , she is . I am afraid she took a great risk in coming here tonight . If your grandfather should discover you are alive and that she came to see you , he would be furious . He might lock her up . " " He could do that ? " " He could and he would . " That night I did not sleep , but thought of Tia Elena . In some ways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she spoke English amazingly well , although with an accent . I found I liked thinking of her , for she was a relative , of my own blood , and I knew of no others to whom I could speak . Yet there was a restlessness in me , a longing for the desert and the mountains . Where was Francisco ? Had he forgotten me ? A longing for the wild places was in me , and there was womcthing else , too , some strange yearning , something that whispered to me on the wind , whispered words I could not hear , calling me back to where the lonely coytes spoke to the moon and the great cacti would stretch agonized arms toward the sky . I could not go back . Not yet . My father would have Wished me to go to school , and Miss Nesselrode had asked me what I wished to become . I suspected it was not only that she wished to know but that she wished to start me thinking of it . She wished me to be making up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the bookstore with Miss Nesselrode , where I was to help her . Two handsome Californios rode past , splendid on their fine horses with silver-mounted saddles . They doffed their sombreros , bowing gracefully to Miss Nesselrode , and I watched them with envy . Their fine horses almost danced as the riders went down the dusty street in their fine clothes and largeroweled spurs . Surely no one in the world could ride like the Californios ! " It is a pity , " she said . " What ? " I was startled . " Their world is going , going very fast , Johannes . They inherited large ranchos , they live well , they have no worries , they work a little at the roundups , they go to fandangos or balks , they flirt with the girls , and they give no thought to tomorrow . It is enough that today the sun shines , that they have a splendid new suit trimmed in gold or silver , that they have handsome horses . They do 4 , not realize their world is gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , Johannes , change was sure to occur , and now it has . The Boston men have come . "  | do not understand , " I said . " It is very simple . The Californios are wonderful people . They are gracious , hospitable , and to those of their kind they are considerate . Yet in many ways they are like children . Most of them have never dealt with money . They have bartered for what they needed , with each other , with the Indians , and with the few traders . " The Boston men , as they call them , are shrewd , hardworking Yankees , and they are going to change all this . I will not like it so well , although I am a part of it , but the change is inevitable . There is no malice in it . The Yankees are simply businessmen . When a Californio wants something , a silver-mounted saddle , a fine suit of clothes worked with gold and silver , he does not question the cost . If he does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are at compound interest , compounded by the month . " Those young men who passed us ? The suits they wear would cost two thousand dollars each . The young man who saluted so gracefully ? He used to have a rancho of forty thousand acres . " " Used to ? " " Yes , Johannes . He has not realized it yet , but twenty thousand acres of his rancho are mine . He has borrowed several times , and although he has been reminded that the interest is due , he just smiles . Most of those who loan the Californios money do not remind them when their notes fall due , and their land is lost to them . " We came to the store and I unlocked the door . Inside ,  | Miss Nesselrode removed her hat and the mantilla that had covered her shoulders . " Their world has changed , Johannes . The time for playing in the sun is over . If they wish to survive in this new world , they must work . They must plant orange or lemon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grain . Two big boxes of books were dropped off at the door by a freighter , hauled from the harbor . My first job that morning was to unpack , list , and place them on the shelves where they could be seen . As I placed the books on the shelves , I called off the titles to her so she could list them . Suddenly I came upon a copy of The Narrative of A. Gordon Pym , published by Wiley &; Putnam , in England . It had been previously published in this country but my father had not been able to find a copy . With some pride I showed the book to Miss Nesselrode . " He was a friend of my father 's , " I explained . " He often talked with my father about the polar regions because of my father 's experiences with icebergs . " " Maybe something of what he told Edgar Poe got into the story . " " I believe their talk was later , after the book was written , but I am not sure . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was just two years old then . " I held it in my hands . " May I read it ? " " Of course . " There were still a few books to unpack , but as I worked , I wondered about Miss Nesselrode . Who was she ? Where did she come from ? On the way west when others talked of who they were and what they had done , she listened in silence . There had been rumors she had been a schoolteacher , but that was probably only a guess . The truth was that nobody knew , and the impression persisted that she had come west to find a husband . It was a natural supposition , but I did not believe it . She liked men and enjoyed their conversation but seemed to avoid the younger , more attractive men . Sometimes when I looked up I  | would see her staring out the window , her lips tight , her face like marble . Of what she was thinking , I had no idea . Yet I sensed some purpose , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something I could feel arising within myself . One day when I had come from school to help in the shop , she voiced it herself . " Thomas Fraser tells me you are doing well in school , Johannes . I like that . " She paused a moment , and suddenly her voice was hard , almost angry . " I want you to show them , Johannes ! They cast your father out , and your mother because she married him , and you because you are their son . " Show them , Johannes ! Become somebody ! Do something ! Make something of yourself ! " Listen to the men who come here . Listen well . Education is by no means confined to schools . Listen to such men talk , hear their philosophy , their ideas about the country , about business , trade , shipping , politics . Listen and learn . " Some people only learn by reading , others by doing or seeing , some by hearing . Learn however you can , but learn ! " Mr. Wilson , Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the men who will make this town into a city . They have ideas , but they do not merely have ideas , they put the ideas to work . " You can become bigger , stronger , better than your enemies . You can defeat them by outreaching them , by becoming a more important man , but also by becoming a better one . " All life is based on decisions . Decide now on what yu 'd like to become and what you would like to do . The two are not necessarily the same , although sometimes they can be . " As the months passed at school Rad kept his distance but he did not like me and I knew trouble between us Wass not finished . Meghan Laurel continued to sit beside mr , but I was shy . I had little experience talking to girls .  | We read better than the others , but Meghan was better at numbers than I. Rad was smart enough , but disdainful of lessons . Because he was as large and perhaps stronger than Mr. Fraser @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did well enough in school to get along . For my part , I avoided him . I wanted no more trouble , and although I had beaten him once , it would not be so easy another time , for he would be ready for me . Miss Nesselrode , or perhaps Jacob Finney , must have spoken to him in private , for never did Thomas Fraser make any comment on having known me before and having known my father , nor did he speak of the trip across the mountains and desert from Santa Fe . Often , when we had settled in our seats , he would talk to us very generally on some topic that he considered important or that occupied his mind at the moment . " Actually , " he said one morning , " all education is selfeducation . A teacher is only a guide , to point out the way , and no school , no matter how excellent , can give you an education . " What you receive is like the outlines in a child 's coloring book . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in these classes , to give you an idea of where you came from , how you got here , and what has been said about it . " When we started to leave the room , I found Meghan beside me . She looked around at me and said , " What do you think of him ? Of Mr. Fraser ? " " I like him . I think he wants to be a writer . " " I wonder where he went to school ? " " In Scotland , I believe . He is Scottish , " I said . Then , fearful of seeming to know too much about him , I added , " Fraser is a Scottish name . " This was one of the first times Meghan had struck up a conversation with me yet I was worried . I did not want to be talking about him because if I seemed to know too much it might start somebody thinking and wondering how I knew . " Your father is a captain of a ship ? " I said .  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He does not use the word captain . ' He sails to China , " she added . " And he has been around the Horn several times . " I said nothing to that . She glanced at me . " You are from the East ? " " Most of us are . I mean , unless we are Spanish . " " My father thinks you are an interesting boy . " Startled , I said , " Your father ? He does not know me ! " " He has seen you . And I have told him about how well you read . He says you remind him of someone . " Suddenly I was scared . I wanted to talk to her but I was afraid of what she might ask , and I did not want to lie " I have to read well , " I explained . " I work at the book shop for Miss Nesselrode . " " Papa said he would like to meet you someday . He said I must bring you home sometime . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had come to a corner . " I 've got to go to the shop now , " I said . " I promised to help . " We parted there , but as I turned away I saw Rad standing across the street , glaring at me . Once , when I looked back , he was still standing there , but Meghan had gone on home . Miss Nesselrode was donning her hat when I came in . " I have to go out for a few minutes , Johannes . Will you mind the shop ? " She left and I gathered up some scattered newspapers and rearranged them , straightened books on the shelves , and had just taken down Pym when the door opened . I t was Fletcher . I le was better dressed than he had been in the wagon , and his beard was trimmed carefully now and he had a sense of confidence about him , and seemed less surly . " How are you , boy ? Long time since we come west together . " " Is there something you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pleasant smile . " Your pa got killed , " he said . " I guess he was n't so handy after all . "  | " There were a lot of them ! " I said . " There were too many of them . " " Maybe ... maybe there was . " He grinned at me . " You got a nerve , boy , stayin ' here in town with those about who 'd like you dead . " My heart began to beat heavily . I was frightened . Yet I tried not to let him know . " I been watchin ' , boy . Do n't you think I 've forgotten . " Suddenly he leaned his hands on the desk . " I never liked you , boy , nor your pa either . He thought himself too good . " Well , he 's gone , but I got you . I got you right where I want you , and when it 's worth my while , I 'll do something about it . " That Nesselrode woman , now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was comin ' west to catch herself a husband , but now I ai n't so sure . Not if what I hear is true . " I said nothing , but I was hoping she would not come back , not now . There was a pistol in the desk drawer . I wondered if I could get to it quick enough . " I hear she 's been dealin ' . Makin ' herself some money . Makes me wonder what she 'd pay to keep me quiet about you . " Me ? " I tried to speak very casually , carelessly . " Why would she pay for me ? I was an orphan and she took me in . Gave me a home . " I looked up at him . " I work for her . " Taking up some books , I returned them to the shelves . " You must be crazy , " I said . " She took me in because I did n't have a home . If you asked her for money , she would just laugh and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was too much trouble . " When I returned from the shelves , I walked right to the desk . He was close to me but I was also close to the gull . He was scowling now and I think what I said had made him doubt . " Nobody cares about me . " I tried to sound bitter . " She 's the only one who 's treated me decent . " " Maybe . " He took out a cigar and lighted it . " That house , now , the one down in the desert ? That belong to your pa ? "  | " We stayed in it . That 's all . " " I been wonderin ' about that . Comin ' by there a while back , I saw a light in the window . Thought at first it was you , but it was n't . I could n't get close enough to see , but there was somebody in there , somebody big . " He scowled as if puzzled . " Real big . " My heart was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Some of the Indians stay there sometimes when they are in from the desert , " I said . Suddenly his manner changed . He smiled in what he probably believed was a friendly manner . " Aw , forget it , kid ! I was just funnin ' with you ! Matter of fact , I thought your pa was quite a man . Quite a man . " He glanced around . " Now , a boy like you , in a place like this , he could make himself a bit of money now and again . " II , He took his cigar from his mouth and leaned closer . " You an ' me , we come over the trail t'gether . We 're friends . If you was to hear some talk , somethin ' about business deals , somethin ' like that , and if you was to tell me . . . ? " Ile knocked the ash from his cigar and put it back in his teeth . " More'n that , there 's talk of rebellion . Talk of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 'd know about that . Or Stearns . He 's supposed to be a Mexican citizen , but ... You hear anything , boy , you come to me . You tell me what you 've heard , an ' I 'll pay . " I lc grinned at me from around his cigar ; then he winked . " Pards , that 's what we are ! Pards ! You an ' me ! " " Miss Nesselrode will be coming back in a minute , " I said . Ile went to the door . " All right , I 'm goin ' , but you 1 ( member ! " I le went out and the door closed behind him .  | Often at night we heard gunshots . Usually they were from Sonora Town , but that did not mean the antagonists were always Mexican or Californio . Just as often , in proportion to their numbers , they were Anglos . Killings were frequent ; knifings and cuttings of varying degrees took place almost every day . Occasionally groups of vaqueros from one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down at the nearest cantina and troop inside , spurs jingling and jangling . Women did not walk on the streets after sundown unless going to or from a fandango or baffle , and then they were usually accompanied by someone of the family . Yet one night , awakening suddenly when it was almost midnight , I heard voices from the outer room . Surprised , and a little anxious , I listened . But the voices were those of women . " I have come to you for help . There is no one else . " " Of course , Dona Elena . How may I help you ? " " I do not know of business . Of things with money . My people do not think of money . We . . . we exchange . One thing for another , you see ? You have the shop . The place of the libros , the books . " I know nothing , but it has been said that sometimes you do business . I do not know of this . There is a woman with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wit h admiration . " " What is it you wish ? "  | " I wish to use money . I wish to do business . I wish to be rich from my money . " Miss Nesselrode was hesitating , but finally she said , " Always there is risk . If one would make money , one must be prepared to lose , also . " " This I understand . It is like gambling , I think . It is like the cards . Sometimes they fall one way , sometimes another . I know nothing of business , but I think you do . " " What of your brother ? " " He knows nothing . He thinks of nothing . He would despise me if he knew . He would not allow it . He borrows money , but has contempt for those who lend . He is hidalgo . He will pay when he wish . Nobody will ask that he pay " " The Yankees will ask . They will insist . " " This I hear . " Miss Nesselrode was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Do you have money ? Will not your brother know ? " " I have money , but he does not know . It is from our mother . " Dona Elena looked down at her hands . " My mother knows I have no husband . My father and my brother think no one is good enough , so I have no one , but my mother understands and in secret she has given inc money , gold money , and jewels . " The woman from the cantina . She says money can work for money . I have thought you could tell me what to do . You see , I could not appear . I am Dona Elena . " " Of course . You wish me to help . How ? " " Make my money work . I will pay . " Miss Nesselrode changed the subject . " Your rancho ? It is large ? " " Very large . " " Your brother borrows money ? Has he borrowed much ? " " Very much , I think . He needs much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring much . He waves a hand , says all will be different soon , and he borrows . " " Do you know who he has borrowed from ? " " This one and that . A little here , a little there . "  | " This work you want your money to do ? Is it that you need money now ? " ' ' Oh , no ! It is for tomorrow , for a long time off . " I saw her lift her eyes to Miss Nesselrode 's . " It is for when I am dead . " " If you will risk losing it , I will help . " She paused . " Is there any particular thing you wish ? " " One thing , first . I wish some to work , to bring more money . I wish some to buy the old debts of my brother . " " I see . " He must not know . He must never know . He would be furious .

" She placed the bag on the table and reached a hand into it , trickling gold coins to the table . Then from the bag she took a smaller bag , and opening the drawstrings , tilted something to the table that gleamed in the dim light . " I have these , also . " " It is quite a lot . You trust me with these ? " " You are a good woman . I feel this . And you have been good to the nino . " If there was more , I did not hear , for I fell asleep and when I awakened again the room was dark and there was no sound but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for which we all had waited . I lay awake thinking of Tia Elena . Women of her class were kept in the background , often knowing nothing of the financial circumstances of their husbands or fathers , having nothing to do with business . What led Aunt Elena to make such a move ? I did not know unless she wished some independence , some security . And how had she known of Miss Nesselrode 's knowlOr did she know ? Did she only come to the one  | friend she had outside her own circle ? The one who would not talk ? Lying there awake with the rain falling softly , my thoughts returned to the house of Tahquitz , far off in the desert . Fletcher had seen the shadow of someone in the house , a very large someone . Of course , it could have been a passerby stopping for the night , as the Indians would not go near the place at night . It might have been the mysterious exchanger of books . Suddenly I felt guilty . There had been no new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Somehow I must arrange for new books to be taken to the house . So much time had gone by ! Going to school , working at the shop , riding around the country , exploring ... The months simply vanished . When I opened my eyes again it was morning and I could hear Jacob talking . Dressing quickly , I went out to see him . He was drinking coffee and talking to Miss Nesselrode . " It would take some doin ' , " he was saying , " but there 's thousands of wild horses in the San Joaquin , and some mighty good stock , too . Nobody 's bothered them for years . With a trap at a water hole , a body could round up a kw . " How many men would it take ? " " Four or five , maybe . " She turned to me . " Johannes , would your Indian friends help ? I would pay them . " " They might . I could talk to them . " " Kelso 's in town . I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good hand with stock and he 's steady . " " All right . You and Johannes plan it , then . I believe that soon Johannes will have learned about all Fraser can teach him , and an adventure like this would do him good . " " flow many horses you figurin ' on ? A couple of dozen ? " She smiled . " I was thinking of four or five hundred . Or us many as you can handle with ease . " " Four or five hundred ? Ma'am , you must he ? "  | " I am perfectly serious , Mr. Finney . I want several hundred horses and I want them broken to ride . If you find any mules among them , and I 've heard escaped mules do run with the wild herds , I 'd want them , too . " " Breakin ' that many horses might take a year . Months , anyway . I mean including catchin ' time . " " Were you going someplace , Mr. Finney ? We have the time . There is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a market soon . The best stock , I 'd like selected for breeding purposes , and we will keep that lot in close to town . " " If you say so , ma'am . " She gathered the papers she had been discussing with Jacob . " I would like Mr. Kelso to work for me here , to fill in for you , Mr. Finney . People are beginning to realize that we work together , and I 'd like to use somebody else for a time . You and Johannes can handle the horses . " She stood up , holding her papers ; then she looked at me . " Neither age nor size makes a man , Johannes . It is willingness to accept responsibility . Besides , I want you out of town for a while . " She turned to glance at Finney . " Mr. Finney ? Have you heard any talk of war with Mexico ? " " War ? No , ma'am . I heard talk of some Anglos up north . Seems there 's some trappers , maybe soldiers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's always rumors , though . " " It is more than a rumor , Mr. Finney . There is a war , and I am afraid there will be trouble here . If we Americans are wise , there need be no fighting . " " How do you mean ? " " Mr. Finney , most of the leaders among the Californios are intelligent men . California is far from Mexico City , and trade is forbidden except with Mexico . The people are denied many of the things they could enjoy , and they lose the profits from foreign trade . " If the American government is intelligent , all can be accomplished through diplomatic channels . Yet if the Californios are challenged , they will fight . It would be a matter of honor . " " Have you talked to Abel Stearns about this ? "  | " Not really . Mr. Stearns is a Mexican citizen and will take no part in whatever is done . I believe he feels it is inevitable , but he is loyal and will take no part in activities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am not a citizen here . Actually , I have no legal right to conduct a business . I am overlooked partly because I am a woman and partly because the local officials like what I am doing . " " You think there will be fighting ? " " I am afraid so . The leader of one of the groups is Fremont . He is said to be ambitious . " Finney smiled slyly . " Are n't we all ? " Her eyes showed her amusement . " Of course , Mr. Finney , but there are ways of using ambition . One must not be rash . " Jedediah Smith showed the way here , others followed , and they have prospered , but change can take place quietly and should be handled with discretion . Have you ever talked to General Vallejo , Mr. Finney ? " " Seen him a time or two . Talked to him ? No . " " I have . Several times , in fact . General Vallejo is very intelligent , above all he is a realist . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think our Mr. Fremont or whoever is to handle the situation should sit down and talk to the general . Above all , Mr. Fremont should listen . " Or he should come south , alone , and talk to Pio Pico . Alter talking to Pio he should get a few of the gente de razOn together over a good meal , a bottle of wine , and their cigars . Above all , he should not attempt to dictate , but he guided by what the gente de razon advise . I believe everything could be arranged as something between gentlenien , do you understand ? " " I do , ma'am , and you may be right . I 'm afraid the Atglos are expecting a fight . " When he had gone , I asked , " Miss Nesselrode , what is happening ? " She worked at her papers for a moment , then said . " A Ic% vears ago Texas fought a war for her independence . l he I united States recognized her independence and Mexho %k.i , unhappy about it .  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ applied for admission to the Union and we have admitted Texas as a state . Mexico said that if we did so they would consider it an act of war . Not long ago a Mexican force crossed the Rio Grande and wiped out an American patrol . " Before coming west , I had talked with some gentlemen from Mexico , who assured me Mexico would go to war if Texas was admitted to the Union . They were quite confident , and with reason , as their standing army is several times the size of ours . " As a matter of fact , the United States is in no condition for war . We have less than twenty-five thousand men under arms and they are scattered across the frontier protecting settlers . " " Will we be beaten ? " " I doubt it , Johannes . Our Constitution provides that no law shall forbid us from keeping and bearing arms because of the necessity for a militia . We have a militia of a sort , but our greatest strength lies in the fact that so many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their use , and above all they are prepared to defend themselves against any sudden attack by an enemy . " You will remember that we won our freedom because we were armed . We were not a simple peasantry unused to weapons . The men who wrote our Constitution knew our people would be safe as long as they were armed . " She gathered her papers and placed them in a leather case . " I was a woman alone , Johannes . I weighed the circumstances and decided to come west , believing California would become a part of our country . " I told myself I would do nothing against a people who have been friendly to me , nor have I betrayed that promise . " On the other hand , if such a change took place , I wished to be on hand to accept the opportunity . No matter who wins , California will no longer be isolated . There will be trade , and there will be a need for horses and cattle . Prices here are three or four times what they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and trade will become important . "  | She paused . " We are two people alone , Johannes . Whatever happens , we must be prepared to move with the tide . We shall be ready . We must be ready . " You were left alone , as I was . I have learned to be strong , and you have also . Whatever is to come , Johannes , each can help the other . We will stand together , you and I. "  | ou are history , " Thomas Fraser told us . " Do not think of history as something remote that concerns only kings , queens , and generals . It concerns you . " Each of you has a history that is part of the history of Los Angeles , a part of the history of California , part of the history of the United States and the world . " You and your families march across the pages of history , and often he who plows a furrow is of more importance than he who leads an army . The army can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became a town on September 4 of 1781 . The founders were eleven adult males and their families . Their names were Camero , Lara , Navarro , Rosas , Moreno , Mesa , Banegras , Villavicencia , Rodriguez , Quintero , and Rodriguez again . These men were or had been soldiers at the Mission of San Gabriel . " In all there were forty-six people ; twenty were children under twelve years of age . Of the men , two were from Spain , one from China , and the rest from Baja California , Sonora , or Sinaloa . " Twelve house lots faced the plaza on three sides , the remaining space was given over to public buildings . This was your town . " On the lowlands near the river , thirty fields were laid out , separated from each other by narrow access roads , these fields to be cultivated by the townspeople . Each was provided with two each of oxen , mules , sheep , goats , and cows . The government at first was largely a military  | government , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discipline . " He paused . " Each of you is a part of what is happening here . Do not think you can sit idly by while it grows to a great city , as it assuredly will . A city is made up of citizens , and citizens are so called because they inhabit a city , and if they will , can direct its destiny . " Is it to be a place where only business is done ? Simply a marketplace , or is it to be a place of beauty ? The great cities , the remembered cities , are the cities known for their beauty . " Our studies slowly became harder and we were given much outside reading and occasional bits of writing to do . In going to and from school we walked only certain streets , staying away from Sonora Town , even though many of the people who lived there were fine people . It was also a hangout for toughs of all kinds . In spite of that , we could see the restlessness in the town , as though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been earlier in San Diego and then had gone north . Often I thought of what Miss Nesselrode had said , that each of us had been left alone . Was that why she had tlfcred me a home ? Because she saw in me what she had been ? Or was there some other reason ? At another time she had said , " Do not be afraid . A little fear can make one cautious . Too much fear can rob you of Initiative . Respect fear , but use it for an incentive , do not t it hind you or tie you down . " Coming and going from school , I had begun to vary my route , taking one for a day or two , then another . The choices were few , but often I cut through orchards or walked paths where no horseman would go , and the l , . Iilornios were all riders . They disdained walking . Much time passed before I saw the don . Miss Nesselrode had told me he rarely came to town , staying on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then there Was a day when , about to emerge from an orchard , I and the clatter of hooves and looked out to see him ride  | There was no mistaking him . He was a handsome man with a white goatee and mustache , riding a magnificent horse and a saddle loaded with silver . There were six men with him on that day , and one of them I remembered . He of the flat nose and the scarred face , the one who had wanted to kill me . They rode swiftly past , but it was not until the dust settled that I emerged on the street and crossed it , leaping over the zanja and climbing the pole fence that divided Miss Nesselrode 's yard from the one behind hers . Sitting on the top rail I fed a stolen carrot to my horse and thought about my grandfather . Such hatred was unreasonable . As Miss Nesselrode said , such pride was foolish , yet it was present and must be dealt with . On that day I did not go to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hatred was unreasonable , and yet ... I had an uneasy sympathy for my grandfather . Was it because of that relationship ? Or was it something more ? His pride was in his family and his name . From what I had heard both from my parents and from others , it was all he had . His family , the name , and his wealth . To him his daughter 's marriage to a common seaman was a disgrace , a blot on the family name not to be tolerated . Having read some of the stories of Sir Walter Scott and similar romances , I could understand what this might mean to a proud man . Our world was different in some respects . It was based on accomplishment , on doing . His seemed to be based on simply being . Supposing that was all one had , and suddenly it was threatened ? Grudgingly I began to see his side of i t , although I had little sympathy for that view . Later , I explained to Miss Nesselrode what I had thought , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then she said , " Johannes , you are growing up . You are becoming a man , and a good man , too . " So much was happening . Thomas Fraser explained some  | of it in school , very carefully , so as not to seem to take sides . The Californios had never liked the idea of their governors being political appointees from Mexico . Some of the governors had been liked or at least tolerated ; many had come only to get rich and get out . One of those they had not liked was Micheltorena , who , after a bloodless battle lought in the San Fernando Valley , had been driven from California , and Don Pio Pico of Los Angeles had become governor . Often I saw him near the plaza , a portly , kindly man with rather heavy features , whose genial manner only partly concealed a native shrewdness and skill in handling people and situations . Suddenly , things were happening . On the seventh of August 1846 , Commodore R. F. Stockton , with a small Ilutilla of ships @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men and some small artillery , marched swiftly and entered Los Angeles . Governor Pico and General Castro evaded capture and escaped to Sonora . Later , after Fremont and Stockton had left for San Francisco , the Californios retook the city from Lieutenant Gillespie . People hurried along the streets or gathered in knots , talking . Miss Nesselrode was irritated . " It need not have happened ! Had they been tactful . . . ! " They had not been . Least of all , Lieutenant Gillespie , nd he had suffered for it . Much was happening of which I knew nothing at all . 3ucoh Finney had ridden in and was staying around our house , in the event of trouble . " Your grandpa 's gone back to the rancho , " he told me . " Rode out last night . You wo n't need to worry about him for a few days . " Have you seen Mr. Fletcher ? " Finney glanced at me . " He 's around . You seen him ? " " Ile came by the bookstore . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I. " He glanced at me again . " Fletcher ? dl , now . " Jacob was plaiting a rawhide riata as he talked . " ' there 's a bad one . We 'll have trouble with him pew day . I feel it in my bones . "  | " He threatened me . " Then I explained what had happened in the store , and Finney listened without comment until the end . " Say , boy ? You 're growin ' ! Had n't realized . If he comes back in , you do n't know anything , have n't heard anything , and if he wants more , you tell him to see me . He put down the rawhide and went to the window , peering out . " Kelso should be in tonight . " Something was worrying him . He returned to his plaiting , then got up and walked to the back of the house to check the corrals . When he came back , he asked , " Have you still got your rifle and pistol ? " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ai n't worried about the Californios or the Americans . I mean , I 'm not worried about the soldiers . It 's that riffraff down in Sonora Town . If they think nobody is around to keep ' em in line , they might start looting . Mostly I worry about the Chinese . They 're good folks , but some of them have money . Quite a lot of money . Jacob Finney spread a bed near the front door and put his pistol alongside his bed . It was almost midnight when I awakened to hear a scratching at the door . Then a low mumble of voices and a new , familiar one . It was Kelso . " Jacob ! It is good to see you , man ! How has it been with you ? " " I 'm working . You can see that . You would do well to join us . " Well ... join you for what ? I am too old to wander around , Jacob . These last months . . . I 've been like a leaf in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were coming west . We were alive , Jacob . There was need for us then , and Farley ... he was a fine man , Jacob , and Zachary Verne . I ca n't get him out of my mind . There was something about him ? " " Of course . We all felt it , I think . He was special . " " But why ? I 've met a lot of men , but none like him . I 've thought about him a lot , coming west when he knew he  | was going to die , thinking only of his son , even willing to be killed if he could find a home for him . " " He was special . So is the boy . " " Is he here ? I ran into Peg-Leg Smith up north , and he was asking about the boy . Said he 'd found him in the desert . He 'd come upon his tracks and followed them . " " The old devil brought him in . Picked the kid up . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too . Somebody was following him . " " Peg-Leg ? " " No , the boy . Somebody was following the boy . " Following me ? No ... I had looked back , again and again . I had looked back to be sure I was holding my direction . There had been nobody out there . Yet , there were heat waves and it was hard to see very far . " What are you talkin ' about , Kelso ? " " There 's something about that boy . Remember the Indian he saw at Indian Wells ? The old man with the turquoise ? He told his pa about it ? " " So ? " " I was back there , happened to mention it . Folks there said the boy was dreaming , there were no Indians at the Wells that night , and there had n't been any for days . ; There was something going on up in the Santa Rosas , up above Deep Canyon somewhere . " " What are you saying ? " " Just telling you , Jacob @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's things out in that desert ... things happen out there . " Look , you 've been around Injuns enough . There 's things they know that we do n't . About the desert , I mean , and the mountains . " " Maybe . I 've heard stories . . . Hell , Kelso , a man ca n't believe half what he hears ! Who knows what an Indian is thinking but another Indian ? Who knows what they believe ? I 've known men who claimed they knew Indians ... they Were talking through their hats . Nobody does . " Jacob paused . " Kelso ? You said Peg-Leg said somebuudv was following Johannes ? Who was it ? "  | " Peg saw the tracks . Moccasin tracks of somebody with a long stride ... mighty long , according to Peg . " " Who was it ? " " Maybe you should ask what it was . I do n't know anything but what Peg told me . " Kelso paused . " Thing was , he did n't see anybody , only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I lay wide-awake , straining my ears for every word . What were they talking about ? What did they mean ? " Look at it this way , Jacob . You 've heard the stories about how Verne and his woman lived in the desert , how the old man tried to find them , had dozens of men out hunting , rewards offered . . . everything . " Did they find them ? No . And why not ? " " Hell , Verne knew the desert ! He 'd roamed out there a lot , and the Indians were friendly . " " I know . Maybe that 's all it was , and maybe I 'm having pipe dreams . " Kelso paused . " Jacob ? Is there any grub around ? Maybe I 'm just hungry . Maybe I just ca n't think straight anymore . " " Sit tight . I 'll roust something up from the kitchen . There 'd be some cold frijoles and some tortillas . " " I 'd eat a cold horse collar right now . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a faint rattle of dishes , then a sound of something being put on the table . " What are you suggesting , Kelso ? What 's biting you ? " " Verne took food to those Injuns when they were starving , so they 'd want to help him . I run into a Mex up to Santa Barbara and he told me they saw no Injuns . Saw no tracks except the two of them they chased . Only sometimes dust storms wiped ' em out . " The more I think about it , I 've been wondering . Maybe Verne was in touch with something out there ? Maybe the boy was ? " Who knows about the desert ? Remember the boy being interested in old trails ? And why did n't the Mohaves follow us ? " " They 'd had enough , that 's all . We shot too straight . "  | " Maybe ... or maybe they were gettin ' into country where their medicine was weak . Maybe they were scared to follow . " Kelso paused again . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear of the Old Ones ? "  | There was a long silence in the room , and my ears strained to hear what would be said . The Old Ones ? Who were they ? And where had I heard the expression before ? " Oh , sure ! Stories told over a campfire . Spooky stuff , like ghosts an ' ha'nts an ' such . We 've all heard them . " " There 's trails out yonder that seem just to wander off an ' go nowhere . Sometimes they just fade out into nothing , lose themselves in the heat waves . Sometimes they go into the mountains . " He paused . " Ever hear of the House of the Ravens ? " " One time . . . down Yuma way , is n't it ? " " West of Yuma , up in some rocky hills down there . These Injuns around now , they do n't know from nothing about it , but they know it 's there , like that Tehachapi country . " Verne was around out there a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own , as much as they will accept any white man . If anybody knew anything , he would . " I 've wondered some about those trails out yonder . The ones that seem to just disappear ? I 've been wondering what would happen if a body just kept riding . I mean , why do those trails go somewhere and then suddenly stop ? " " You want my advice , Kelso ? Stay away from them . There are some things no man should pry into . Leave ' cm to the Injuns , or the Old Ones , whoever . " " One thing I 'm sure of . There were people here before 1RA  | the Injuns the Spanish found , and there were quite a lot of them . If they built from adobe , nothing would be left . You know how quick it melts away if it is n't plastered or roofed over . " As far as that goes , look at our own towns . What would be left after even two hundred years if nobody cared for them ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be all . " Iron rusts away . Hell , you let two , three hundred wars pass and nobody would ever know we 'd even been here . That goes for our cities back east , too . You just notice any old abandoned building and see how fast it kills apart ! " I 've heard stories about a city that used to be out in the desert , in the Mohave . It was destroyed by an earthquake and some great rains that followed it . Some of the I n i j uns or whoever they were took refuge in the Tehachapi Mountains , lived around there for years until the last of them died off . " You ever been in the Tehachapis or up Caliente Creek ? Ever wonder why there 's no Injuns there ? Well , I 've thought about it , but I 've got no answers . " Kelso ate in silence , then asked for more coffee . Tired as I was , I was wide-awake . " Maybe I 've spent too much time in the desert and mountains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you in to wondering . You hear things , little things , you think you see things sometimes , and maybe you do . " Some of the Injuns have stories about what they call e Thunder-Bird , some great bird or flying thing that tikes a noise like thunder . There was a Mexican who said something like that used to land in a lake , Lake IW , abeth , they called it . Used to kill his sheep sometimes . Then later there was a story about two cowboys who killed a flying reptile or something down in the desert in Arizona . " " You been listening to too many stories , Kel . I think h'p time you came in out of the hills and settled down With folks . " " Maybe .... Again , it may be that I 've been closer to  | some of those Injuns . After all , they 've been here a long time , Jacob . " When morning came I went outside and looked for Mr. Kelso , but he was gone into the town . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Something or somebody had followed me in the desert . There were trails that seemed to lead nowhere . A city in the desert that had vanished , and the Thunder-Bird ... the House of Ravens . . . and my own house of Tahquitz . I wished Francisco was here . I had been in Los Angeles a long time when one day , our girl Rosa told me she had seen someone lurking under the willows near the house . When I entered the kitchen that morning , Rosa was making tortillas . She went to the door and pointed . " It was over there ! " she said . " He was standing back under the leaves . I could not see him very well . " Walking over to the willows , I prowled around among them , looking for tracks . Suddenly I found them , and not only tracks but cigarette butts , many of them . Some were old , some were new . Some were there from before the last shower ; some were fresh . Somebody was watching our house . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to come to the place of watching . I followed them back to a narrow lane that led along behind some farm yards to a street . Whoever was watching us had come up that lane from the street several times , perhaps many times , and he had watched our house while hidden in the willows . Had he seen Aunt Elena ? Who was it , and why was he watching our house ? Was he watching me ? Or Miss Nesselrode ? When school was over that day I went to the book shop , and when there were no customers , I told Jacob , who was there , and Miss Nesselrode about my discovery . " Look into this , will you , Jacob ? " she asked .  | " The boy 's good , ma'am . I 'll take a look , but I doubt I 'll find anything he did n't . " " I believe , " she added , " it is time you took that trip we spoke of once to see the Indians . " She stood up suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start tomorrow morning . " " We 'll be gone quite a while , ma'am . Do n't you think ? " " Mr. Kelso will be here . I want Johannes out of here , and be sure nobody sees you leave . Change horses as often as you wish , but get away from this area very quickly . " She turned to me . " You wished to take some books ? Pick five or six and list the titles , if you will . Leave the list on my desk . " Jacob took up his hat . " All right , ma'am , just so you will be in good hands . " " I can handle it . " Miss Nesselrode smiled a little . " I believe you will remember that when need be I do not esitate to shoot . " Jacob smiled . " No , ma'am , you surely do n't . " He turned is hat in his hands . " Do you want us to check out that wild-horse hunt while we 're gone ? Might be a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a chance to ride up through the edge of the mountains and desert , maybe get A line on where we 'd best look . " " All right . " She looked over at me . " Pack what you need , Johannes , nd only what you need . I shall miss you very much , but m will have a great adventure , I am sure . " " Yes , ma'am . Will you see Aunt Elena , ma'am ? " Miss Nesselrode considered that , her fingertips resting Vr t he table . " I shall try . She is a very interesting woman , mi Aunt Elena . " Wt. rode away before the sun was up , when the last tlrrs lingered in the sky , reluctant to yield their light to e sun . We rode rapidly , and as before , we held to the t k roads and trails . As we rode , Jacob pointed out places he knew or had  | heard of . We covered a lot of ground , moving at a shambling trot except where we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept to routes that were parallel to the trail , wishing to be seen by no one . " How you gettin ' along in that school ? " Jacob asked suddenly . " Had any more trouble with that Huber boy ? " " No , sir . It is a good school . Mr. Fraser is a good teacher , the best I ever had . " " Do n't see how he makes it pay with no more students than he has , but if he can hold on , there will be more . " " There are six now , " I said . " I saw Cap'n Laurel 's daughter there , did n't I ? The pretty one with the gold hair ? " " Red-gold , " I corrected . " Yes , she sits beside me . " " Oh ? No wonder you had trouble with that Huber boy . " He glanced at me with sly amusement . " Wait until you meet her pa. 01 ' Cap'n Laurel  --  now , there 's a character ! " There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Meghan had said he had asked about me . " Laurel 's a canny man . In some ways an uncanny one . Some of his crew were ashore here a time or two , and it seems the old man is either mighty knowing or he 's tuned into something . They say he goes places where no cargo could be expected and there is always cargo for him . " He knows the coast of China and Japan like he owned it . Siberia , too . Sometimes he sails up the rivers , they say . Always something doing with him . Uncanny ' is the word . " You know these fellows who go around tuning pianos ? They have an ear for the sound , the exact sound ? Well , Laurel seems to be that way . He 's been known to change course of a sudden , no warning , just a sudden change of course that will take him out of trouble or where there 's cargo . " " You mentioned Japan . I did n't think they allowed foreign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't . Only Laurel , he knows somebody or some-  | thing and he goes . If you get to know him , I 'd surely like to hear what you think . So would Miss Nesselrode . " Riding in silence as we usually did gave me time to think , and there was so much to think about . So many puzzling things had come up . My mother had said my lather had premonitions . Was that what Captain Laurel had ? Or were they what is called hunches ? Or was it merely knowledge ? My father had talked to me of his voyages and of my grandfather 's , and I knew that sometimes a sea captain kept certain ports of call or anchorages to himself , knowing that at intervals valuable cargo might be picked up there . " I always listened carefully when your father talked about the sea , " Jacob said . " Your father would tell me we will never know how much of the world was explored . The sea was often difficult to cross , but it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again by craft of every size and material . The Phoenicians , who Were among the greatest of the early navigators , never flowed anyone to know where they went , and only a few tories have come down to us . " They knew , as did the Carthaginians who developed m a Phoenician colony , sources of raw materials they ivulged to no one . For many years they permitted no titer ships in the western Mediterranean , or to sail through he straits into the Atlantic . Then a Greek captain named olcus sometime around 600 B.C. managed to slip by cm and went to Tartessus , a port near Gades , which we II Cadiz . He returned with a ship loaded with silver , hich left him a rich , rich man . " Nobody will ever know what voyages were made in the long ago . Hanno , a Phoenician , is reported to have balled around Africa on orders from Necho , a pharaoh of E ivpt . " I  --  udoxus was on a ship off the mouth of the Red Sea in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the figurehead of a ship he had last seen in Qaides , and that was over one hundred years before Christ . " You 'll like Cap'n Laurel , I think , and he will like you .  | Get him to talkin ' about the sea , if you can . He 's made friends with some priests in Japan an ' China and they 've told him things . " Before sundown we would ride off the trail and camp in a secluded spot , preparing our meal while it was light and with wood that gave off no smoke . By darkness the fire was put out and we slept until morning , trusting our horses to warn us of danger . We stopped to buy a few supplies at El Campo , a place of one store and a few adobes . " Stay with the horses , " Jacob told me , " and keep out of sight . Folks remember travelers when there 's so few . " It was hot and still . The horses stood in the shade of some trees and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Flies buzzed lazily . The horses dipped their noses in the water and drank ; bees also came for water . I looked off toward the store , several hundred yards away , and wished Jacob would hurry . The warm sun made me sleepy . I tugged my hat lower over my eyes . The horses flicked their tails to drive away the flies . I dozed . There were footsteps in the dust . A boot crunched in the sand . I put my hand under my coat where the gun was , for the step was not Jacob 's . Boots and legs . From under my hat 's brim without lifting my head I saw them . Narrow Spanish boots , largeroweled California spurs , pants split from the knee down . " Most folks , " a voice said , " would think you was asleep , but not Monte McCalla . I 've played ' possum a time or two m'self . " Tilting my head back , I looked up at him . He was slim and wiry , not a tall man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man of the saddle . " How are you ? " I said . " You can take your hand off that gun , boy . I 'm friendly . " " As long as I have my hand on this gun , you better be , " I said . He chuckled . " Now , I like that ! That 's a proper answer .

" Sort of curious , " he said . " Is n't often a man leaves his horses and walks away to a store when there 's a hitchin ' rail right out front . " " There 's shade here .

" " I 'm sleepy , " I said .  | The two-story adobe was shaded by massive oaks whose branches hung above the porch on the second story . In the patio a fountain bubbled . The night was cool and pleasant , and in the main room on the first floor Don Isidro sat with his cigar , a glass of wine on the table close by . He was a thin man with high cheekbones and hollow cheeks . His hair was gray and his mustache and beard were streaked with it . He was dressed with quiet elegance , and when he heard the sound of booted feet on the patio pavement , he frowned slightly . What ? At this hour ? A man appeared in the open door , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holding his hat in his hand . The man wore a white shirt , a red sash , and fringed leggings . A big pistol in a holster , and a knife . He was a man , Don Isidro recalled , who preferred the knife . " You wished to see me ? " The man turned his hat in his hand ; then he said , very softly , " He lives . " An icy chill seemed to touch the back of Don Isidro 's neck . He leaned forward and dusted the ash from his cigar . " Bah ! " There was contempt and impatience in his tone . " I have seen him . I have seen him alive . " " You are mistaken . You have seen another . FIe could not survive . " " The father survived . "  | Blue veins showed on Don Isidro 's brow . " Nonsense ! " Then he asked , " Where did you see this . . . this child ? " " In the pueblo . On the street . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Elena had appeared , almost ghostlike , at his elbow . There was irritation in his tone . " It can not be . It is not possible . " " There is a woman , an Anglo . It is Senorita Nesselrode . He lives at her house . " Without turning his head , he said to Elena , " What do you know of this ? " " I know the woman . She has many friends . " Then gently she added , " She is a friend to Don Abel Stearns and Don Benito Wilson . " " Bah ! Who are they ? Anglos ! " " You have forgotten , my brother . It is not we who are in power , but the Anglos . " Then she added , " Pio Pico is also her friend , and General Vallejo . " " Do you know her ? " " She knows everyone , my brother . She has many friends . " " So you have said . And we have not , is that what you imply ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you say . So you often say . This woman ? This Senorita Nesselrode ? I wish to visit her home . I wish to visit it now . . . tonight ! " " Tonight ? But it is far . It would be after midnight ? " " So much the better . I wish to arrive without warning . " He got to his feet . " You ! Get five men and come with me . Five armed men , do you understand ? " " You can not do this ! Go to a woman 's house in the middle of the night ? " " I shall do as I please . If the boy is there , he is mine , acid I shall take him away . What right has this woman to have my grandson ? " " So you can kill him ? Kill him as you have tried before ? " She paused . " You do not know the Anglos , my brother . They do not care for you or your name . You would hang. , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " He turned sharply around , glaring at a serving woman . " You ! My boots ! Quickly now ! " He tugged on the boots , then stamped into them . He turned to his sister . " You are a woman , so I can expect no more , but you are a fool , also ! This child 's existence is an insult ! My daughter and that . . . that peon ! " " He was a fine man , and he would soon have been a ship 's captain . " " Bah ! A ship 's captain ! Of some miserable little coastal vessel ? Married to my daughter ? " He strode to the door , turning there . " Do not worry yourself . The child is dead . I go but to make sure . " Dona Elena listened to his footsteps as they retreated across the patio . For an instant she thought of getting her own horse and trying by back trails to reach the town before him . Yet it was no use . She did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost . She remembered the cool beauty of Miss Nesselrode . She was a woman , that one . She would not be easily defeated . Yet , Dona Elena was frightened . What of the boy ? Isidro would see him , recognize him , know he was alive , and he would kill him . Even the courts , even the law , would return a grandson to a grandfather . Miss Nesselrode awakened suddenly as a rider rode past her window . She sat up . Had Johannes and Jacob come back ? What was wrong ? No , of course not ! Nobody in her employ would ride past on that side of the house . Outlaws ? Thieves ? Quickly she got to her feet and slipped into her robe . Where was Kelso ? Taking up her pistol and holding it at her side , concealed in the folds of her gown , she went into the living room just as the door burst open and several men charged in . The first one through the door was Don Isidro.  | " You have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I do not know what you are talking about , senor , but you have broken into my home . You have broken into a lady 's home in the middle of the night , a despicable act , something no gentleman would do . Now I must ask you to leave . " " Search the house ! " Don Isidro ordered . Miss Nesselrode lifted her pistol . " Senor ! I am a dead shot ! If you or one of your men takes a single step , I shall shoot you through the ear , senor , and tomorrow morning it shall be told all over the pueblo that the noble Don Isidro was shot through the ear by a woman ! " A voice from her right said quietly , " They ai n't goin ' nowhere , ma'am . I got me a scatter-gun . " Kelso turned up the wick on the lamp , shedding more light into the room , holding the shotgun ready , elbow braced against his right hip . " You ! " She pointed suddenly at a vaquero @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embarrassed young man . " Will you do me the honor of walking through those rooms ? If you see a boy , please call out . " He hesitated a moment , then came forward . It required only a minute , for the doors of the rooms stood open . He emerged from the kitchen at the last . " Senor ? There is no boy . There are only these , and the cook . No more . " Furious , Don Isidro glared at the man with the flat nose . " You ! " He turned back to Miss Nesselrode . " Senorita , I a m ? " " Sir , you are a fool . You are also a coward and a disgrace to the name of grandfather . You are proud of a name which you disgrace with every day you live . " Your story is well known . You drove your daughter from the country , you had her husband murdered , and you have attempted to murder your grandson .

" The son-in-law whom you had killed was a dozen  | times the man you think you are . You are nothing , sir ! Nothing ! " Don Isidro 's face was a haggard mask , gray and ugly . " If you were a man , I would kill you ! " His voice was hoarse with emotion . " I would ? " " No you would not , Don Isidro . You would not face a gun in the hands of any man , or a blade . You would have me killed by one of those ! " She pointed at the men at his back . " When did you ever kill a man ? Or defend yourself ? When did you ever do anything but live on what your ancestors created for you , shielding yourself behind an honorable name ? " Your ancestors , senor , and your countrymen were proud men , they were explorers , fighting men , but what are you ? What have you ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had searched the house had turned and slipped quietly away . The others , shamed , were backing toward the door . Don Isidro struggled to speak , but before he could find words , she said , " Get out ! Get out and stay out and do n't ever come to my door again or I shall shoot you myself . Better still , I shall simply set the dogs on you . It is what you deserve ! " He turned ; his men were gone . Blindly he went to the door and stepped out into the night . Kelso lowered the shotgun . " Lord a'mighty ! Ma'am , I never saw the like ! You whipped him like a mangy dog ! " " I am sorry , Mr. Kelso . I did not mean to lose my temper , but that fine boy , and his mother and father .. . It was evil , Mr. Kelso ! Evil ! " " Yes , ma'am . " He hesitated . " Ma'am ? D ' you have any idea what you 've done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done what no dozen guns could have done . You 've destroyed him . " Those men with him ? They 're gone , ma'am . They wo n't serve a man like you showed him to be . When you foller a man , you take on his color . Well , you showed him up , made him to be a coward and a weakling . When he gets back to that ranch , he will be alone . And you know something ? I 'd lay a bet he 's never been alone in his life !  | He had only to lift a hand to get whatever he wanted . Now he will lift a hand and nobody will come . " " Will it be that bad ? " " Yes , ma'am . Those men who work for him . They may not have much , but they have their pride , too . Much of their pride is often in the man they follow , the brand they ride for . Take that away from them and they have mighty little , so they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " For a moment , when he reached his horse , Don Isidro leaned against the stallion . His mind was numbed with shock . Nobody had ever spoken to him like that . No one had dared . How dare she say such things ? Hiding behind the fact that she was a woman and could not be challenged . He reached for the pommel and pulled himself into the saddle , then looked around for his men . They were gone . He was alone . Why , the fools ! Did they think he would allow such conduct ? He called out . " Andres ! Pedro ! Come , we are going ! " There was no reply . Ile looked around again , puzzled . They were gone . Gone into town for a drink , perhaps . Yet there was a sinking within him , a heavy lump in his stomach as of something dead . He started the horse toward home . " ' That woman ! " he said aloud . How dare she ! Remembering her , he shuddered . A witch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How terrible she had been ! Ile looked around . He was alone on a dark road . Nobody followed , no sound of hoofbeats from his riders . The patio was dark and still when he reached it . He disnwunted , looking around for a man to take his horse . There was no one . Ile turned , staring all around . The only light showed Ilona the house itself ; all else was dark and still . " Joaquin ! " he shouted . Ile tied the stallion to an iron ring . Somebody would  | come soon . He crossed the patio , his steps echoing in the stillness . It was very late . No wonder there was no one around . He had not realized . It had been late when he left for that woman 's house . He felt an emptiness within him . What had he been thinking of ? She was a respected and respectable woman , well known and liked not only by the Anglos but also by his own people . His people ? Since when had he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or Mexicans . He was from Castile ! He was .. . He now felt sick inside . What was all that nonsense , anyway ? He had left Castile to escape the sneers , the things they would say about what had happened . He had run away from a disgrace he could not bear . He had come here , and then Consuelo .. . That American fellow . That common sailor ! He had dared to approach her ! Dared to speak to her ! His daughter ! Leaving the stallion , he went into the house . A light burned from the table . He crossed to the sideboard and poured a drink of aguardiente , then another . Taking a third glass , he went to the big horsehide chair and dropped into it . He was tired . Exhausted . It was very late and he was not as young as he had been . He tried to turn his mind away from that woman , but her flashing eyes , her voice , so scathing .. . There was a soft movement behind him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is very late . You had better go to bed . " " My horse ? " " I will care for him . Go to bed now . " " You know ? You heard ? " " I heard . When they came back for their things ? " " Their what ? " " They are gone , Isidro . They have left us . " She paused . " Their pride was in us . We have failed them . "  | His mouth tasted bitter . He glared to right and left ; he started to rise , then sat back . The fools ! The contemptible fools ! Let them go ! He would find better ! He had the money . He could pay . Bed . . . yes , he should get some sleep . Tomorrow would be soon enough . He never had been able to think well when he was tired . He should leave here , anyway . He should go back to Spain . His men were gone . All of them .  | When we rode @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Monte McCalla rode with us . Jacob seemed to accept him easily enough , but I was suspicious . I did n't know who he was or what he wanted . When we started drawing close to the Springs , I kept standing in the stirrups , looking . " There it is , " I said suddenly , pointing . " The Calling Rock . " McCalla made it out . He studied it . " What about it ? " " They say if you turn to look back when you 're leaving , you will always return . Some just call it the Leaning Rock . " " I like the first name better . Say , that 's a good story . How about it ? Did you look back ? " " I looked back a-purpose . I wanted to come back . " When we came closer , I pointed up Chino Canyon . " There 's a cave up there with a pool in it . The Cahuillas used to go there to drink the water before they went hunting . Said it gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Have to try it sometime . " He noticed me looking down my back trail , and that Jacob turned in the saddle from time to time . " You boys are riding kind of edgy , " McCalla said at last . " You expectin ' trouble ? " " You can cut out and ride alone if you 're worried , " Jacob said . " As a matter of fact , we think we left trouble behind , but we do n't depend on it . " " We 're ridin ' together , " McCalla said , " so your trouble  | is my trouble . You see them coming , and I 'll ride back and see if they can chew it . " " This is n't your fight , " Jacob said . " I 'm ridin ' with you . You do n't size up like thieves , and in a fight three is better than two . When I rode up to your camp I taken a hand in your game . " He was a strange man . Half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much of a voice , but not bad , either . Yet he liked to sing , and he seemed to know more songs than anybody I 'd ever met . When he discovered our plan to catch wild horses , he wanted to come along . " I 'm handy with a rope , " he said , " and I can ride ' em as good as any man . " Later , when we were alone , Jacob looked over the fire at me . " What d ' you think , Johannes ? Shall we take him on ? " I think he 's a good man , " I said , " and we 'll need help . " " My idea exactly . " The next morning we rode through the sandhills to the store at the Springs . When we walked into the store the storekeeper knew me at once , yet now I could look him right in the eye . ' h o w d y , son ! You 've grown some inches . " " Yes , sir . Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with arranging some items on the counter . " Well , I reckon . Sometimes it is an ' sometimes it is n't , although I got an idea it will be empty when you show up . " " And Francisco ? Is he about ? " " Comes an ' goes . If he wants to see you , he will . Indians are notional . " Jacob bought various items from the shelves  --  flour , salt , coffee , a ham , and a couple of slabs of bacon . Walking to the door , I glanced toward the sandhills where the house lay . Did I detect a faint suspicion of smoke ? My heart began to pound . I hesitated a moment ; then , turning to Jacob , I spoke as casually as I could . " I think I 'll ride over while you 're picking up supplies . Do n't he in a hurry . "  | He glanced at me , and Monte McCalla looked over his shoulder at me . " Want me to come along ? " " Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offset any comments , I added , " It was where my father was killed . I 'd like to ride over there alone . " " Oh ? Sure , " Monte said . " We 'll come along later . " Jacob was not fooled . He knew about the exchanging of books , and he was no doubt as curious as I. First I unlashed the sack of books and put them on the saddle before me ; then I turned my horse and walked it slowly along the trail . When I turned into the winding lane through the dunes , I began to sing some lines learned from my father from an old sea song , " The Golden Vanity . " In the middle of the yard , I stepped down from the saddle and shouldered the sack of books . When I came to the step , I put the sack down and drew the drawstring , opening it . Taking out one book , I looked at it , turning a few pages , then put it down atop the sack , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room was as I remembered it . The floor was freshly swept , there were no cobwebs in the corners . The books were still neatly arranged on their shelves , yet the air was not stuffy as in a long-closed house . It was fresh , clean , with a faint smell of pines . The beds were neatly made , only now there were sheets instead of simply the blankets I remembered . I opened the cupboards . They were well-stocked . Jacob need not have worried . The coffeepot was on the coals in the fireplace and the coffee was hot . Taking down a cup , I filled it and sat down , my back to the door . I was home again . This was the desert , this was my desert . My parents , captured by their love for each other , had fled across it , had hidden within it , had survived upon it . And I , too , had survived . And now I was back to the desert , back to the soaring mountains behind nay house , back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stillness that held silent voices that spoke only to me . Slowly , taking my time , I drank my coffee , looking out  | the window at the dark waves of the rock , pushed high by monstrous tides within the earth itself , waves long stilled that had given birth to pines , and exposed raw edges to the wind , the rain , and the ice . Enormous tides had built these mountains , but now they were being plucked at , teased , annoyed by wind and rain , by snow that fell and changed to ice , expanding to crack the rock and drop the fragments at the mountain 's base . This was as it had been and as it would ever be . Men would come and go , leaving their tiny scars for the wind to hide with sand , men who in their ego thought the world belonged to them , forgetting the dinosaurs who had ruled the earth for many more millions of years than man , and were gone now , leaving only bones . Some thought them dragons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some only shrugged and walked their way , seeking traces of gold and ignoring the mystery of the bones . Finishing my coffee , I stood up , hearing the coming of horses and the voices of Jacob and Monte , talking . I stepped outside to pick up my sack of books and saw that the one I had left atop the sack was gone . Deliberately I kept my mind from wonder . If something or someone was here who so desired privacy , I would not invade it by so much as a thought . We shared something , whoever it was and I. We shared a community of books , the companionship of gathered t houghts , and for the time it was enough . It did not want more , so I would not ask for more . Knowledge is awareness , and to it there are many paths , not all of them paved with logic . But sometimes one is guided through the maze by intuition . One is led by something felt on the wind , something seen in the stars , something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ receive the message , the mental pores must be open , and we white men in striving for our success , in seeking to build a new world from what lies about us , sometimes lot get there are other ways , sometimes forget the Lonemime Gods of the far places , the gods who live on the rmpty ' sea , who dance with the dust devils and who wait  | quietly in the shadows under the cliffs where ancient men have marked their passing with hands . Once my father had told me of finding a cliff dwelling built high in the rocks , the bricks plastered with mortar from clay , and in the clay were the marks of fingers . Who left those prints in the clay ? Who pressed his hand here and then stepped back to view it ? Why did he leave his signature here ? To show that he , too , had a hand ? To tell others that a man had gone before , had passed some brief time in this place , and then gone on ? My father had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possessor of the hand ? Or were they the bones of another , following long after ? Why did he impress his hand upon the clay ? Did he hope to send across the centuries a thought ? A dream , perhaps ? Or just to say that " I , too , was here ? This was my place . This I built with my hands . " I knew the image of that hand would be with me forever , for we who pass do not own this land , we but use it , we hold it briefly in trust for those yet to come . We must not reap without seeding , we must not take from the earth without replacing . My father told me of a Navajo once who found an arrowhead on the sand and took it up , but then he took from his pocket a small buckskin sack and from it a pinch of dust to replace what he had taken . Jacob Finney rode into the yard with Monte McCalla , and they swung down , leading their horses around to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , holding up a hand . There , in the dust , was a footprint , the print of a gigantic moccasin ! " Lord a'mighty ! " Jacob said in an awed whisper . " Look at the size ! " " Make two of mine , " Monte said , placing his boot beside it . " Hell , it would make three of mine ! " I looked , then looked away . That footprint , I told myself , was no accident . Like the hand in the clay , it was a signature . It was a hint , a warning , the opening of a story .  | Never before had there been a footprint , never before an indication , only the missing books . This was a statement . This was saying to me , " This manner of man am I. If you would go no further , you may leave the trail here . " Within me there was a pang , a sharp pain of sympathy . Where would such a one find a companion ? Who could bridge the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this being , this creature ? Could I ? How lonely he must be ! How cut off by strangeness , by difference ! Yes , I thought , the footprint had been deliberately left . Yet I , in my own way , had been a stranger , had been cut off from others of my age by the circumstances of my parents . Wherever I had gone , people had thought me strange , except in the desert , except , so far as I knew , the Indians . Yet no doubt the Indians thought all white men strange , for our ways were different from theirs and each people is apt to consider their own ways as " human nature , " not realizing they were merely a pattern imposed upon them by rearing , by education , by the behavior of those with whom they associated . " Got a nice place here , " Monte commented thoughtfully . " Somebody taken a deal of trouble . Clean , too . " Monte glanced over at Jacob . " You know these Indians ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He takes over where Indians are concerned . They know him , and his pa was a big man among them . You 'll see . " As dusk came , we lighted the lamps , and I took the other books from the sack and arranged them on the shelf . I removed some of those that had long been there , planning to take them to the book shop for those who might not have read them . Reading material was too highly valued and scarce not to be shared . " Your pa was killed ? " Monte asked . " Right out in front , " I said . " He got one of them , might have taken more , but he took time to shove me out of the way . Ile was a good man with a gun . " " Zachary Verne ? I 've heard of him . " Monte glanced at  | me . " How about you ? With enemies like you 've got , you should learn to use guns . " " I do all right . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the best . Then you do n't have to worry . " " All right . " They spread their beds on the floor near the fireplace and I went into my old bedroom and closed the door . When I was in bed I looked up at the ceiling , which was lost in darkness , and remembered Meghan . When we had rounded up the horses , we would go back , and maybe then I would see her , and would meet her father . In the night , the wind came up , blowing softly in from the desert to the east , that strange , empty desert where the old trails were and where the sea had once been . Soon I would be out there , far out on the sands , wandering . And in the night , when the winds whispered around the eaves , I lay awake in the house of Tahquitz and wondered where he was , and how he fared . Where was Francisco , who had drawn the smiling face ? And when we met again , would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend ? We were older now , and it had been long since we talked . By Indian standards he would now be a man , but was I not a man also ? The swift-paced years had gone by and left no footprints on the sand that had not blown away . I could only hope there would be some traces , some memory in his mind . Tomorrow , I hoped , I would . see Francisco . My eyes opened suddenly from near-sleep . What of the old man with the turquoise ? Would I see him also ? Or was he only a ghost figure in my imagination ? Why had he come to me that one time ? If I had stayed , would he have spoken ? Would he come again ?  | My father had prepared me for marvels . He was a cool , logical man , but life upon the sea and the desert had left him with the realization that man thus far has but scratched the surface of knowledge and of his possibilities . " Keep an open mind , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say what can or can not be , nor can he say what does or does not exist . " Landlubbers make much of what Columbus did , but many longer voyages had been made under more difficult circumstances . Landlubbers might believe the world was flat ; any seaman knew otherwise , for he had seen ships disappear over the curvature of the earth . " Landlubbers would have you believe that ancient seafarers hugged the coast , when any fool knows that is by far the most dangerous place . For thousands of years men have known the stars and how to travel using them as guides . The open sea had no dangers that compared with the reefs , offshore or onshore winds , baffling currents or floating objects , which were much more common close to shore . " The farmer , the hunter , or the deep-sea fisherman always had his eyes upon the heavens . He lived with their vagaries as much as with the trails he followed or the furrows he plowed . He could read the weather in the clouds , locate distant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flight of birds and which lived upon land and which upon the sea . Long before there was a compass , he understood how to locate the sun on an  | overcast day . He who sits at a desk and tries to understand by logic often loses touch with the realities . " Remember this , my son : our world is one where the impossible occurs every day , and what we often call supernatural is simply the misunderstood . " When you go into the wilderness or out upon the sea , keep your mind open . Much can be learned from books , but much remains about which no book has been written . Remember this : the poor peasant , the hunter , or the fisherman may have knowledge that scholars are struggling to learn . " All this was in my mind when I pulled on my boots that morning . Jacob was already stirring about , and Monte had been outside . He came back in while Jacob was frying some ham . " That track , " he said . " I found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Another track ? " Jacob inquired . " Not exactly . He stepped on a rock in a place where the ground was soft . Pressed it deep . I took it up and could see , it was freshly done . Judging by the stride , that thing must be seven or eight feet tall ! " " Jumped , maybe ? " " Ai n't likely , " Monte replied . " That rock would have been tipped a mite when he landed . No , that man or whatever it is is big . I checked that track again . It must weigh twice what I do . Maybe more . " " Do n't worry about it , " I said . " Whoever or whatever i t is has n't bothered us . Let 's return the compliment . " Monte started to speak , but Jacob interrupted . " I 'd say that 's good advice . Let 's just forget it , shall we ? " Ile glanced around at Monte . " And do n't ask any questions or even mention it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it make ? I 've already forgotten it . " We switched over to talking about wild horses and how they could be trapped , how canny they were , and the necessity for picking out the good ones . " If they 're too old , " Monte said , " even if they 're in fine  | shape , we 'd be fools to bother . The old ones are tough to break . Some of them will die before they 'll give in . " " There may be some horses that have escaped from ranches , " Jacob suggested , " and that will almost surely be true of any mules we find . " " There are wild , unbranded cattle out there , too , " I said . " My father told me that some of the cattle he rounded up for the Indians had been running wild . " " How are we going to find those Injuns ? " Monte asked . " We wo n't , " I said . " They will find us . " " You mean we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let them choose the time , " I said . " They have their own ideas about things . And do n't judge these Indians by others you 've known . They 're different . " They 're changing , and some of the old ways are being forgotten , and some of the wise old men have not passed on their knowledge , partly because they found no one worthy of it . " " What 's it mean ? Their name ? " " Cahuilla ? It 's an open question . Some say it means ' power ' or the people of power ' or ' the power way , ' and by that they do not mean physical strength , but wisdom and something more , the power from the mind . " Monte shrugged . " Maybe . I never knew any Injuns who were much on the mind . Smart ... yes . Mighty smart when it comes to that . Of course , it depends on what you mean by mind . " " You just may not have known them well enough , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that just about the time you decided you knew all about Indians , you would discover you 'd only begun to learn , and then after you 'd learned an awful lot more , you would realize you really did not know anything yet . " " Maybe . . . maybe . " Jacob was like the Californios in that he preferred to work with a rawhide riata , so he was busy plaiting the rawhide . He was a skillful man who worked fast . All of us had much to do to be ready for the wild-horse hunt . We must wait for the Indians to appear , but I had no doubt  | they knew of our presence and Francisco or one of the others would meet us " accidentally " at the store . Yet there was something in me that I did not quite understand . Mentally I was more content than I had been at any time since leaving the desert , yet at the same time restless to be out there in the really wild country . Was there an affinity between myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believed , that men had lived other lives ? And that one of mine had been lived in the desert ? Or ? and the thought left me uneasy  --  had I left something there that now I must find ? Of these thoughts I said nothing to my companions . Yet Jacob was puzzling to me . He seemed a simple man , yet on occasion he brought forth ideas that were far from simple . I knew that many men of the wilderness have much time to think , and their thoughts may wander down strange byways . My own father was an example . More and more I was wondering about him , and why he had done certain things , why he had often spoken to me as he had , suggesting ideas rarely shared with someone so young as I. Still , he had known , at the end at least , that his time was short . He had no doubt been trying to pass on as much of what he had learned as possible . No individual completely acquires the experience of another , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the next generation , much time can be saved . In technical ways , methods of working and such , knowledge has been passed on , but too few have learned from experience . I remembered my father once saying that perhaps in the future some device might be constructed into which all historical knowledge could be fed , particularly all knowledge of government , of diplomacy , of statecraft , and then this device might tell us what mistakes have been continually made and what situations to avoid . Men have passed on the knowledge of how to mix cement , lay brick , splice a line , navigate a ship , make steel , and dozens of other crafts , yet in politics , statecraft , and social relationships we continue to repeat old mistakes . Wandering outside , I gazed up at the looming moun-  | tains , at the distant haunts of Tahquitz . Up there , somewhere , was Tahquitz . Both the fabled creature of whom the Cahuilla spoke and the creature who sometimes inhabits this house where now we lived . When the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known , he or it would make itself known . Until then its privacy would be respected . Seven feet tall ? It seemed impossible . Yet I myself was almost six feet now , and still growing . Who could say ? I had never seen a man so large , although occasionally stories were heard of huge men . Walking around to where the track was , I studied it with care . I must remember , for sometime it might be i mportant . Then with my boot I brushed out the track . I could not escape the feeling that it had been deliberately left , for there had been no others . Only that one , as if it were a hint , a warning , or even a signature . Our waiting was not in idleness . Jacob taught me how to plait a rope , and Monte already knew , although he favored a hair rope , as many from Texas did . We would need a number of them , for some would surely be broken , no matter how well done . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about wild horses and their capture . That night when Monte returned from the store he said , " We got company . Neighbors , I mean . " We looked at him , waiting . " Paulino Weaver , he 's moved In over yonder . Been here for some time . " " Mountain man , " Jacob said . " I mind meeting him Some while back . He 's a good man . " " A man named Sexton with him . They 've made friends with old Juan Antonio . They 're trading , cutting timber wnd what-all . " Monte looked around at me . " Paulino knew your pa back when your pa was on the dodge from the old don . " They were good men , yet in a mild way I resented them . I was jealous of my Indians , jealous of my canyons tlnd desert , yet even as I thought that , I was amused by It . People would come , and my deserts would not remain ? tnpty , yet that thought made me irritable , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stars were out , and the wind off the mountain was cool . If more men came , crowding the desert , what would happen to the Lonesome Gods ? Where would the spirits of the ancient ones go ? Would they fade into the old trees ? Into the rocks ? Or , being worshiped no longer , would they fade gradually away ? When I went back inside , I said , " It 's bound to be , I suppose , but I do n't like the country getting crowded up . It seems to me we 're losing something . " Jacob nodded . " I know how you feel . I 'm gettin ' so if I see another rider on the trail , I 'm jealous , but we ca n't be that way . It 's here for all of us . " " There 's something out there , Jacob . Something I 've got to find before it is too late . There 's something out there for me . " He said nothing for a while , and then he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They were on the run , but no matter . Your pa told me . They found happiness out there , happiness with each other . Maybe they did n't have it long , but they had it good . Do n't you ever forget that . " Thinking of them led me to think of Meghan . Where was she now ? Did she ever think of me ? I smiled into the darkness beyond the door , thinking how foolish that was . Why should she think of me ? I was just a boy who had sat close to her in school , a boy too shy to talk , too awed by her presence to do anything but grow red and embarrassed if she so much as looked at me , which she rarely did . How did my father meet my mother ? Had he been shy , too ? I doubted it . He seemed the essence of confidence , of assurance . Months had gone by with Meghan , and I had said nothing , yet ... there had been communication of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Thomas Fraser had often had us read aloud , first one , and then the other . It was not much , I realized .  | Restless because Francisco had not appeared , I saddled my horse the next morning and rode down to the store . As I walked up the steps , a man came from the store . It was Fletcher . His smile was not pleasant , and there was a kind of a taunting in his expression that irritated me . " Been keepin ' an eye out for you , " he said , " wonderin ' when you 'd head for the desert . " " Does it concern you ? " His smile was there , but the amusement was gone from it . " Maybe , " he said . " Maybe it does . Your pa , now , he spent a lot of time in the desert . Him and those Injun friends of his . I been wonderin ' why , and there 's some who figured that was where he got his money . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Him an ' your ma . They lived it up back east there , an ' your pa had money to pay your way west . Now , you take what your pa paid for you an ' him on the wagon . That 's a good year 's income for many a well-off man these days . " Where 'd your pa come by that kind of money ? I figure he had it when he went east . I figure he got it out of that desert . " I simply stared at him . My father had had a difficult time during those years back east , barely having enough to keep us alive at times . There were periods when he had , briefly , done quite well , and then at the end the windfall from the races the horses had won , and the generosity of his employer . " You are mistaken , sir , " I said . " My father had nothing when he went east beyond a little he had saved from t ; -t t le sales @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pocket and bit off the encl . " Maybe , an ' maybe not . Why 'd he stop here instead of ridin ' right into Los Angeles with the rest of us ? " He waved a hand . " Why stop in this godforsaken spot ? I say he had reason . I say he 'd found gold , or those Injuns *bowed him where it was . " I say your Miss Nesselrode knows about that gold . Why else has she been keepin ' you ? Why are you goin ' Into the desert with that there Finney ?  | He put the cigar in his mouth and struck a match on his pants , bringing up his knee to draw the material tight over his thigh . " You go ahead . I 'll foller . Maybe there 's enough for all of us . " " Fletcher , " I said , " you 're a fool . " For a moment I thought he would strike me , and I said , " Do n't try it , Fletcher . " Something in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he suddenly looked at me again . " Hell , you 're a man now . ' Least you 've growed up . Now I can kill you . " What happened within me , I do not know , but I was suddenly lighthearted . I smiled at him . " Whenever you 're ready , Fletcher . Whenever you 're ready ! "  | What I thought of as the store was really nothing of the kind . It was merely a sort of dwelling where the owner kept a few supplies which he sold to the Cahuillas or to passersby . Under the counter he kept a jug from which he dispensed occasional drinks . When Fletcher walked away , I turned to see him go . Already I had learned that one does not become careless around such men . There was murder in the man ; I accepted the realization and was careful . Yet when I turned , I was surprised . Francisco was there . For a moment we looked at each other , and then I drew a quick round face in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ added the smile . Then we looked at each other , nd slowly he held out his hand . His was not a muscular handshake . For that matter , w Indians whom I had known more than touched palms . he strong handshake that many think is an indication of haracter is not so at all . Many very strong men merely lasp one 's hand . Theirs are not limp handshakes , nor the firm grip one hears of in fiction . We walked over and stood in the shade of some mesquite . " ; We 're going up-country , " I said , " to catch wild horses . lie squatted on his heels , and I did likewise . " We hope 10 catch many horses , " I said , " and we will need help . " ith a twig I dug in the soil for a pebble , turning it *vv .. " We would like to find five or six Cahuillas to help  | Francisco pushed his hat back and squinted at the pebble I had dug from the hard-packed earth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " We are thinking of three or four hundred horses . We would build a long fence of brush to guide them into a corral . There would be much work , but we would pay or share the horses . " " We do not need horses , " he said . After a silence he said , " You catch cows , too ? " " Maybe . " " Catch cows , we take some cows . " " All right . " We sat silent , watching a raven plucking at something in a palm tree . There had been times when I was a boy that I had gone with them to the oak groves to gather acorns , or to the mesquite for their beans . I had worked beside them and learned to know them , a little . There were old men I remembered who sometimes talked to us as they worked . I remembered the stories of the coyote who had planted mesquite beans after the sea disappeared from the basin and left it dry . The fish and the seabirds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there were forests of mesquite soon . Yet , until the mesquite grew , times must have been hard . They did not speak of that , only the story of the coyote planting the mesquite . Later , talking to Monte , I mentioned the story . " A legend , " he said . " The Plains Injuns , too . They have many stories of the coyote . " " But in all the legends there is some truth . As for the coyote planting the mesquite , it could be true . " He took the cigarette from his mouth . " You mean you believe that ? " " Why not ? The coyote eats the mesquite beans . He goes into the desert to hunt rabbits . Where he stops to do his business , he leaves some undigested beans , perhaps ? They grow . Why not ? That 's the way plants arc often scattered , through bird and animal droppings. "  | " Did n't think of that , " Monte admitted . " Runoff water would bring down some seeds , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . " You think those Injuns will come ? " " You can depend on it , " I said . " They will come and they will be ready . " " You 've been in their villages ? " " Time and again . Lived with them when I was a boy . I stayed in this house but often went hunting with them , gathering nuts and seeds , listening to the old men tell of when the water disappeared , little by little . " It came and went several times . Sometimes it came slowly , and at least once it came with a great rush , carrying great logs on a vast wave that swept up the valley . Many Indians were lost . The only ones saved were those hunting in the mountains or close enough to the mountains to escape . " Gesturing toward the mountains , I said , " They have villages up there . In the Santa Rosas , too . " There are old trails in the mountains and on the desert . A few of them I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Why ? " . Why , indeed ? Turning that over in my mind , I shrugged . " How do I know ? It is my destiny , I think . All I know is that I shall never rest easy until I have gone into the desert alone . Until I have followed some of those trails to wherever they go . " " I know , " Monte said wistfully . " It 's something around the bend in the trail or over the next ridge . I feel it , too . We would need extra ropes , so we bought hides from the Indians or the Mexicans and we made ropes . We worked , waiting for the day . Our horses were in good shape , as we knew they must be for the work ahead . The next morning , when we went outside , Francisco was there , and five Cahuillas were with him ; with them were their horses . " Come on in , " Jacob invited . " We 're fixin ' some grub . " Nobody moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simply looked across the desert toward the mountains . Francisco looked at me and shrugged . " It is the house of Tahquitz , " he said . Jacob walked over and looked at their horses . They were good stock , mustangs all , and built for the work they must do . " Tomorrow we go , " he said . He glanced at Francisco . " All right with you ? " " Bueno . " There were still a few supplies to get , a little work to do . When my part was done , I sat down with The Last Days of Pompeii , by Bulwer-Lytton . It was one of the books I was leaving for my unseen visitor , but I wished to read it first . However , I was scarcely reading , for my thoughts were of him . Who was he ? What was he ? A giant ? A monster ? An evil spirit , as some presumed ? Had my father known him ? Had the Indians seen him ? If he was so large a being , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he live ? How did he move back and forth without being seen ? At night . . . of course , he did travel at night , at least until he returned to the mountains . That he came from the mountains , I was sure , for there was the smell of pines about him . Where had he come from ? Where had he learned to read ? Or to lay mosaics as he had here ? Or to build so beautifully ? How did he pass his days ? The only thing I actually knew about him was that he was or had been a builder , a worker in tile and timber . Also , that he liked to read , and read good books . Presumably he was a thoughtful man , but I did not know . Nobody knew . Suppose he was mad ? Suppose on some occasion he should suddenly go berserk ? Or decide that I was spying upon him ? What then ? He could  --  he had  --  come into this house in the night . Suppose he did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over my shoulder . What did I know of him ? Nothing ... .  | By the time I closed the book , all were asleep . I extinguished the candle and went outside . The Cahuillas had chosen to sleep in the shed , so I walked along the path that led into the sandhills . It was very still , the stars bright as only desert stars can be . Alone , I stood , feeling the stillness , the softness of the night . Far off I heard a faint music . Straining my ears , only half-believing . . . . It sounded like a flute , like one of those I had often made as a child . I listened , but the sound faded , vanished . The night was empty again . An Indian ? Some of them played flutes , but the music had a sound . . . It must have been European or American music . At last I walked back to the house and went to bed . Tomorrow the desert , and after that the northern valley ? the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been there , probably the first one . Others had followed , but very few . The northern desert was the haunt of the Mohaves , at least at times . In the mountains a few Piutes remained , although from what Francisco had told me , they were leaving , going away . There was something about that Tehachapi country they no longer liked . " I do not know it , " Francisco said . " Ramon does . " " Ramon ? " " He will meet us . I do not know where , but he will . " He glanced at me . " He comes when he will . Of you I have spoken , and he will come . He will know where the horses are . Ramon is of the desert , " he added , " and the mountains . He comes alone to join us . " He is Cahuilla ? " " No Cahuilla , no Chemehuevi , no Piute . I do not know . " " There are wild horses there ? " " Muchos . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ north and in the mountains there are horses . There are also cattle . " " We will touch no branded cattle . " " Of course . It is understood . "  | I thought over the situation , and what lay ahead . It was good to be with Francisco again , and I must come to know the others . And in the morning before we left , I must sweep the floors , leave all as we had found it . At daybreak I was up and dressed , going outside to saddle my horse before Jacob had started breakfast . Monte joined me , and the Indians were already trooping into the yard , bringing their packhorses to tie to the corral bars . As they rode , I followed , trailing behind . Glancing toward the store , I saw four saddled horses at the water trough . Whose horses ? Why ? It was unusual at this hour , and the sight of them disturbed me . The Indians , too , were noticing them and talking among themselves . As the last of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I glanced back again . A man had walked out from the store and was shading his eyes after us . It looked like Fletcher . My thoughts returned to Los Angeles , and I wondered where Miss Nesselrode was , and Aunt Elena . Aunt Elena , who had never been married , a strange , lonely , yet lovely woman , so tall , so remote , so very quiet . What did she think to herself when she was alone ? What did she think of that brother who had kept her so ? And Miss Nesselrode . Who was she ? Had she ever been married ? Was the story of a lost love and a broken heart true ? What was it that drove her ? And was it her loneliness that caused her to reach out to me ? Whatever the reason , I was grateful . She had given me a home when I had none , had given me something of stability , of understanding , of sympathy , and of assuiirance , too . Just to see her standing alone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smiling gently . One would never suspect the iron that was in her soul , the cool efficiency of her mind . She had guided me a little , suggested a little , and had  | helped me to bridge that gap from being a boy to becoming a young man . What of her ? What did she really want ? Security , yes . No doubt of that . She had spoken to me of our being alike , of each being left alone , and there had been a hint of sadness , a hint of rejection , a hint that somewhere behind her there had been those who rejected her because of lack of money , of position , of whatever . This was supposition , but it was a possibility and might account for much . Whatever the reason , she had gambled her little money on a fast trip west , had come to California believing in it , determined to make a place for herself there . Was it because she had been known in the East ? Had she come west to escape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a finger or demean her because of what she was or had been ? Whatever else she was , she was certainly a woman of fine courage and of no uncommon ability . Riding along a desert trail gave one time to think , to consider . Talking became difficult because most of the trails were for riding single file , and talk also created thirst . So one rode and dreamed or thought or simply dozed . Overhead flew an optimistic buzzard . In the distance was a curious coyote , and far behind , barely visible against the sun-glaring sky , lay a dust trail . A very thin trail , hanging like a mute question mark against the sky . Francisco was leading now , and Jacob fell back , waiting for me to come up to him . I turned in my saddle and nodded toward the rear . " Lots of travel these days , " I commented . " Ilunters , " he agreed . " I wonder what they expect to find ? " The sun grew hotter , dust devils pirouetted across the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost themselves as we drew nearer . Sweat trickled down my face . I mopped my cheeks with a bandanna and wiped the sweatband of my hat .  | Far ahead , unbelievably tall in the blue water of a mirage , was a man on horseback . Francisco turned in his saddle and pointed toward the still black figure , so far off , yet so visible . " Ramon , " he said . " You will see . "  | hat do you know of this Ramon ? " I asked . " He is Ramon . " Francisco added no comment for several steps and then he said , " He is a shaman , a man of magic . " He paused again . " He is also a fine horseman . " We drew closer . Ramon did not move , simply sat his horse , waiting . Was he young or old ? I could not guess at a distance , but he sat very erect , and his sombrero was hanging from his saddle horn . " He will know where are the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mirage of blue lake retreated but RamOn remained where he was . " He knows you , " Francisco said at last . RamOn ? I knew no RamOn . Ile was slim and he looked tall . It was not until he dismounted that I saw he was not tall , but of less than medium height . He wore a shirt open at the neck and something suspended from a rawhide cord that was behind his shirt . He wore buckskin breeches and a wide leather belt . He had a knife in a scabbard at his hip , but no pistol . A rifle was in the scabbard made of fringed buckskin and beaded . " I am Ramon , " he said . " And I am Johannes Verne , " I replied . " This " ? I turned in my saddle to indicate them ? " is Jacob Finney and Monte McCalla . The others you know . " " I do not . " Surprised , I added , " This is Francisco . The others are Alejandro , Martin , Diego , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one to the other as I mentioned their names . His hair was nearly white , his eyes intensely black , his skin a smoky brown , more like East Indians my father had pointed out than our own Indians . It had become a custom for Indians to take Spanish names , although they had their own , often known only to their families . The custom had no doubt begun at the missions , when the fathers , for their own convenience , had given the Indians Spanish names . Ramon turned his horse about and rode away , leading us . Francisco came up beside me . " He does not look like a Cahuilla , " I said . " He no Cahuilla . I said it . He is RamOn , and that is all . " " I do not know him . " Francisco eased himself in the saddle . " I did not say you know him . I said he knows you . " It was a difference , of course , but how did he know me , and from where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , riding a line-back dun with black mane and tail as well as black hairs around the hooves . The horse had a thicker neck than most horses I 'd seen , and looked strong . Throughout the long afternoon we rode , and RamOn did not stop until suddenly he turned from the trail and led the way into some tumbled boulders . There , in a small cove almost surrounded by giant rocks , was a small pool of water , and water trickling into it from among the rocks . He stepped down , drank from the spring , and watched us do likewise . When I got up and wiped the drops from my mouth , he was looking at me . " Johannes of the desert , " he said . " Perhaps , . " I acknowledged , and then added dryly , " Let the desert say . " We made camp , each tending to his own horse , Sel'no preparing a meal . " The horses , " Ramon said , " will be here . " He drew a quick map @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | the horses would be , and the trail between . " Here " ? he put a finger on a spot ? " are mountains , and there is a pass , very narrow . A trail leads to the sea . " He glanced at me . " To Los Angeles . " All this " ? he gestured to the north ? " is the valley of San Joaquin . " He gestured to his right and east . " There is desert " ? he glanced at me again ? " the desert you crossed . " He looked at me again . " How many horses ? " " Four hundred , if possible . Four hundred of the best . " " It is many . " " We will need many . People will be coming , and they will need horses . " " No doubt . " He looked over at me . " You can read ? You can read books ? " " I can . " " I have never seen a book , " he said , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a book , " I said . " It has many pages . " " Yes , " he agreed , " but the pages are never quite the same . " You live near here ? " " Wherever , " he said . " My home is where I lay my head . " " But your family ? Your people ? " " All gone . I am alone . " After a moment , when the fire was crackling and a bit of smoke rising , he said , waving a hand toward the desert , " Out there was a city . When I was small , it was my home . There was a shaking of the earth . A small shake , then a very strong shake , and much came crashing down . There were other shocks . For days the earth shook . Some of us ran away to the mountains , my father among them , taking us . " The rains came , and the winds . The winter came , and the hitter cold . With my father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , weapons . Others would not go , for they were afraid . " We had grain stored for the future . We took it . We returned to the mountains , and my father was killed for  | the food we had . My brother , my sister , and two others ran away and hid . " It was very cold . We found a small hollow among the hills where there were two springs . Below the hollow was a stream . We hid there and were not found . The winter was very cold , but we dug into the hill and built a shelter before it . " Sometimes when hunting for food we would see others , but we did not trust them , so we hid and watched them . They did not fare as well as we , for some of them had never hunted . " " Indians ? " I said . " Who did not hunt ? " " They lived in the town , " he said . " Do your people hunt who live in towns ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ canyon among the trees , and there was the second spring . We did not go there , keeping it in reserve . There were nine of us . " In the spring , one was killed by a spotted cat , what you call a jaguar . There were many around here in those years . Now it has been years since I have seen even one . " Three of us went back to the town . The walls were of mud brick and they had fallen . Now they had returned to earth . Only a few were left . We picked around , but there was little to find . " The fields were gone , some washed away , others buried in dust . " When we came back , two more were dead and somebody had been there to kill them . The others had retreated to our other place and had hidden there . " Food was passed around , and we ate . He ate sparingly , and spoke no more of those bygone years . How long ago ? I did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the older I believed him to be . On the second day after that first camp with Ram6n we came to where the horses were . We saw them out on the grassy plain , thousands of them , and for a time we sat our horses in the shade of trees along the mountainside and watched them . Our eyes picked out this one and that , judging , by the way they moved , their grace and speed .  | In droves of one hundred or even as many as two hundred they fled across the plain , wheeled , and turned back , manes and tails flowing . They would come charging across the plain and come within a hundred yards or less of us before pausing , heads up , studying us to see what we were , then wheeling and rushing away like the wind . It was a magnificent sight , and nothing I had seen equaled it . They seemed to flow across the plain like a varicolored wave , with often as many as a thousand horses within sight at one time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them stood out . One , a splendid black stallion with one white stocking , must have weighed a thousand pounds or more , whereas most of the horses were somewhat smaller . One particular herd , numbering well over a hundred , wheeled and darted about us several times , as though challenging us to a race , but we made no effort to accept the challenge or to draw near , wanting them to become accustomed to our presence . They showed no evidence of ever having been chased , although Selmo suddenly pointed at a fine-looking bay who wore a brand on his hip . The area through which we now rode , walking our horses and studying the land , was covered with grasses . Once , nearing the mountains , we saw a herd of elk that must have numbered nearly a thousand , and as they moved , it was a veritable sea of horns . Some of these seemed as large as the horses themselves . Toward nightfall , coming up to the place where we would camp , Monte killed one that would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw several wolves , not at all afraid , for they had not seen our like before . They seemed to be following the elk to pull down any calves they could find straying from the herd or lagging behind . They were big gray wolves , moving like ghosts along the flanks of the elk herd . Ramon led us again to our camp , this time beside a small but swift-running stream , several acres of grass and near the stream a spot of less than an acre sur-  | rounded by tall pines and a few scattered oak , although we were almost too high for the latter . We staked our horses on the grass after watering them , and went about preparing our own camp . With Ramon and Francisco I walked out to look over the area . After a minute , Jacob walked out to join us . " This is their watering place . " Ramon pointed to a bunch of tules further along the stream . " The water spreads out and sinks into the ground over there . " Jacob studied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the brush . " We could build our corral to straddle the stream so they 'd have water , filling in with brush between the trees , and some poles to fence them in . " We walked along , studying the lay of the ground . Our plan was to build a wide-mouthed funnel down which they would go to water , a funnel that would narrow at the corral itself and which we could close off once enough horses were gathered . " Take us a while , " Jacob said finally , " but we can pull back to camp each night and let them come down to water if they like . And if they get thirsty enough , they will come . " They 'll leave when they wish , and they will get over being scared . Finally , we 'll just close them in . We should be able to get two , three hundred horses in there all to once . " It was not all that easy , but we did n't expect it to be . Going out there with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trees . Here and there it needed poles . We took our time , working steadily , pausing for coffee now and again or simply to tell stories . We could see the horses from time to time , and when evening began to come , we 'd stop work so our movements and the ring of the axes would n't frighten the game . We were not thinking only of the horses , for in dry country water belongs to all living things , and we moved off from the creek to our own place , farther up . Then the horses would come in , moving along slowly but warily , alert for any movement . Along with them were a few elk and a deer or two .  | Sometimes , while it was still light , we 'd lie up on a rock and watch them come . Wolves would come , too , and in the morning sometimes there would be bear tracks . Occasionally we killed an elk or a deer , but never close by . One of the boys , often it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do our shooting there so as not to scare the game . It was hard work , but the air was clear , the sky blue , and the days went by like the drifting clouds , so we scarcely noticed they were gone . Finally our corral was ready , and the drift fence , too . We 'd made a swinging gate of poles and brush that we swung wide to one side , and then we rode away up the valley . We wanted not only the horses that had been coming there , but a good many more . We started from ten miles up , the lot of us , spread out across the valley , and after we 'd fixed ourselves a spot of grub and drunk some coffee we rode out across the country , turned and began to drift , walking our horses down toward our corral . This was wild stock , but we 'd been moving around and not bothering them , so they had n't , after the first day or so , paid us much mind . Now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and they moved ahead of us . After all , this was their country , and most of them had lived their lives here . Wild horses are , more than you 'd believe , inclined to be homebodies . They did n't like to get too far from where they were born . They knew that country , and if driven away , would come back . Gradually the valley narrowed , and gradually we cowboys moved in closer together . Not so much as they 'd notice at first , but by the end of the first hour we were only a hundred yards or so apart . Ahead of us the horses were bunching a little , and here and there some wild old %t a I I ion was beginning to be bothered by it . Once in a while one would stop , stand head-up looking around , but the way ahead was clear and we were coming along behind . We did n't seem to be anything to worry about , but they just did n't want us getting too close . til  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the water , that black stallion decided he did n't like that crowd of horses up ahead and wheeled . He made a dash for the opening , but Alejandro and Martin were already swinging the gate closed . It had been easy , just too easy . Later , when they had become wary of men , it would prove much harder , but we had them . We did n't know how many , but we guessed around three hundred horses . There was grass enough for a few days , and there was water .  | t will never be that easy again , " Monte commented . " They just are n't used to people . Nobody 's tried to catch them before . " " And they always drink from that stream , " Jacob agreed . We sat our horses , studying them . We would have to cull them , turn the rejects back to their freedom , and then start breaking the others . Watching them from where we were , we could see a few that could be turned out , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well-built bunch of horses . " Give ' em a few years , " Monte said , " and you 'll look a long time to find any horses you want to keep . We 'll cut this bunch for culls , and the next bunch , too . Then along will come some other wild-horse hunters , and they 'll cut for the best stock , too . It wo n't be no time at all until all you find out there will be culls . " " Do you suppose Miss Nesselrode was thinking of that ? " I wondered . Jacob shrugged . " Maybe , maybe not . I 've given up trying to second-guess that woman . I just know that seven times out of ten she 's right , and when she makes a mistake , she swallows it and never tries to blame anybody else . " The quicker we could get rid of the culls , the better off we 'd be , as there would be that much more grass for what remained . We stayed away , watching from a distance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about wild horses . Folks think it 's the stallion who keeps them together . It 's true that he herds ' twin around , fights off varmints and any other stallions I22  | who want to take over , but there 's something more going for them . Take away the stallion , and the others will fight to get back together . " They 've become a family . Good neighbors , at least , and they want to stay with their friends . Watch ' em , you 'll see . " Jacob indicated the black stallion . " That one 's a troublemaker . He 's too smart . I think we should get rid of him . " I want him , " I said . " Look , " Jacob warned , " that stallion is anyway six years old . He 's been runnin ' wild all that time . He 's tough and he 's smart , and he looks to me like a fighter . He 'll make you no end of trouble . " " He 's right , Johannes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I insisted . " Leave him to me . " " Your funeral , " Jacob said , " and it could be just that . " The weather held . It was bright and clear , day and night , and we took our time . Nobody was in a hurry , nobody was waiting for us . Nobody had a watch and nobody had a calendar . We just forgot all about time except for dawn and sunset . When we quit work , we 'd eat , and then I 'd stroll down to the corral . I 'd already learned that singing will quiet a herd , mostly because it knows where that sound is coming from and that you 're not some varmint sneaking up on them . I 'd lean on the gate and keep my voice low . I wanted them to get to know me , and especially that black , who seemed to know that gate was the way out . He watched it like a hawk , never far away , always watching his chance . We started weeding them out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the corral and just easing the culls out , with a man on the gate ready to open and close it . Some of the culls ran away ; others hung around looking for their friends , like Jacob had said . We tried not to make any fuss . We wanted them to get used to our moving around and to the feeling that we did n't represent trouble . We spotted a couple wearing  | brands , and there were three mules in the lot which showed signs of having been worked . Even in the pasture we 'd created , they separated into bunches . The black stallion kept his lot to one side , but never far from the gate . " Horses may seem stupid , " Jacob said , " but they know what they have to know to get along , and you can teach them a lot if you take time . Wild horses have learned a lot by just surviving out there , so be careful . " By the fourth day , taking our time and raising no dust , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sitting by the fire considering our next step when Ramon came in and squatted near us . He accepted a cup of coffee , sipped a little , and then said , " Somebody is out there . " Jacob looked over at him . " Injuns ? " " White men . Six , maybe seven . They watch us . " " Could be Fletcher , " I said . " I never liked that man , " Jacob agreed . Monte reached for the coffeepot . " Why do n't we take turns standing by with rifles ? Maybe two at a time ? " Fletcher it could be , but there was also my grandfather . His holdings were vast and he had many riders , few of whom I knew by sight . There were other dangers , too , the Mohaves , who raided deep into the settlements at times , and the few lingering Piutes who came down from the Tehachapis . There was also , somewhere around , old Peg-Leg Smith . Supposedly he had left the country , but one could never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and if I judged him right , he would wait until we had our horses broken to ride , and then steal them . They would bring more money . I said as much , but Jacob doubted his presence . " Heard he was up Frisco way . You know , that little town on the buy ? " " Monterey ? " Monte suggested . " North of there . Yerba Buena , they called it . I heard the name was changed . " here was good talk around the campfire , and occaxionalIv the Indians joined in , but usually it was Alejandro  | who did the talking . He had left the Cahuilla country as a young boy and worked on the west side of the mountains ; then for a time he had gone north and worked for a doctor up there , often riding with him when he made calls on the sick . We moved our camp closer to our horses , both to protect them and to let them become familiar with us . Jacob decided after studying the horses that aside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showed signs of having been ridden . Separating them from the others , we brought them outside , and Monte offered to ride them . Ramon was quiet , speaking rarely . He had an easy way with horses and occasionally led one out of the corral , walked it around , let it graze where the grass was green and fresh while he held the picket rope himself . His way of gentling horses took time , but when he called them , they came to him . For three weeks we worked hard , breaking horses to lead and to ride . The Cahuillas we had were all riders , but Francisco was the best of the lot . Even Ramon avoided the black stallion . " He is a devil , " he warned . " I 'd say turn him loose or shoot him , " Monte advised . " He 's been wild too long and has been leading that herd too long . Look at the teeth scars and hoof scars . He 's a fighter . " Nobody needed to tell me that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was wary , watching his chance to escape and take his bunch with him . Sometimes I 'd gather some green grass from near the water and drop it over the fence , and his mares would eat it , but not him . At night when I was on watch I 'd move over close to the corral where I could keep an eye on the horses . Thev would know if trouble was coming before I would , and it was a lot easier to watch them than to stare into the shadows under the trees . Sometimes I 'd talk to them , low-voiced . Mostly I was talking to him , and I had an idea he knew it .  | I 've known men who thought horses stupid , but it 's been my impression that horses are only as stupid as their masters . A riding man in wild country becomes very close to his horse , and most talk to them as to another person . The horse listens , and although he may not understand , there is communication and he senses the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was wild and might have been wild all his years , yet sometimes I wondered about that . Sometimes I had a feeling he had belonged to somebody somet i me , maybe when he was very young . Each morning we roped a few head and took them out of ' the corral , where any fighting they did would n't get the others wrought up . Monte McCalla was a first-class hand , more experienced with breaking horses than any of us . Alejandro was good , too , as he 'd broken horses for the doctor up north . We were settling down to eat when we heard a horse walking . Jacob stayed where he was by the fire , but Monte an ' me , we faded back into the dark . The Cahuillas were already there . We waited , and then somebody called out , " Hello , the camp ! How 's for some coffee ? " " Ride in , " Jacob Finney said , " but ride easy , with your hands in sight . " Ile was a tall , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quick , ferretlike eyes and he rode a dapple-gray gelding , it fine animal . There was no blanket roll behind his saddle . " Get down and come up to the fire , " Jacob said . " Coffee 's on , and we 've got some grub , such as it is . " " Thankee , thankee much ! I 've been ridin ' all day and I 'm mighty tired an ' almighty hungry ! " Monte , his rifle in his left hand and his pistol in its holster near his right , came in from the dark , flanking the stranger . Then Francisco and Alejandro came in . The rest staved out , away from the fire . Diego was with the horses , and I suspected Jaime was , too . Ile came on up to the fire , taking a look around as he did so . Seeing those men coming in from the dark seemed  | to make him a mite nervous , and you could almost see him counting . " Come from Los Angeles , " he said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Colorado . " " Well , that 's different , anyhow , " Monte commented . " Since that gold strike up north , everybody is headin ' that way . " " Gold is where you find it , " the stranger said easily . " I figure they 've got to eat , so I 'm thinkin ' of drivin ' cattle north . No matter whether they find gold , they 've all got to eat . " Nobody had much to say to that . He drank coffee , seemed about to speak , then changed his mind . Finally he said , " Seen a corral yonder . You catchin ' wild stuff ? " " Here an ' there , " Jacob said , " catchin ' an ' breakin ' . " " Must be gold down here , too , feller knew where to find it . " " Like you said , " Jacob said mildly , " gold is where you find it . We figure folks will have to ride to get anywhere , so we 're breakin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I asked innocently . " I mean Mohaves ? Or Piutes ? This is nervous country , so many of them around . Although , " I added , " they do n't often come this side of Tehachapi Pass . " He looked around as if seeing me for the first time . " No ? Why not ? " " Superstitious , " I said , " or what we 'd call it . They do n't like the spirits up yonder . " I indicated the Tehachapis . " There 's a spell on this country . " " You do n't seem much skeered , " he said contemptuously . " We are n't , " I said . " We 've got our own medicine man . He 's out there now , " I added , " casting spells on our enemies , whoever they may be . " " I do n't put no stock in such things , " he said . " I did n't either , " I replied . That this man was a spy , I had no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supposed to be traveling for days . His horse had n't even worked up a sweat , yet he implied he had come far , and he did not eat like a man who had missed even one meal .  | " I did n't either , " I repeated . " Until that man " ? I was lying cheerfully now ? " stole our medicine man 's horse . " This fellow just rode up and threw down on him with a pistol and took his horse . Our medicine man just stood there and said , Did you ever have a broken back ? Somehow I see you with a broken back . ' " The horse thief , he laughed sarcastic-like and said he 'd had no broken back . At that moment the medicine man lifted a hand , and that horse started to buck . Next thing you know , that horse thief was on the ground . " He started to get up and he cried out and sweat broke out all over him . Our medicine man , he went and mounted his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' there , he said , ' You said you did n't have a broken back . Well , you 've got one now . ' And then he just rode off an ' left him lyin ' t here . " " What happened ? " I shrugged . " What could happen ? It was August . It was the Mohave Desert . If he was unlucky , he 'd have lasted two , three days . If he was lucky , he 'd have died the first night . " He glanced from one to the other of us , but nobody was smiling . Monte said ; " Aw , he 's a good feller , long as you do n't cross him . " My eyes dropped to the stranger 's gun . The thong was slipped off the hammer . Now , a riding man would want that thong in place unless he expected trouble . Alejandro had moved slightly . He was now seated right behind the stranger . He spoke softly . " You did n't tell us your name . " Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We need something for the marker . " " What ? " He started to get up , then sank back . " What marker ? " " Suppose horse thieves rode in and attacked us now ? " I said . " We might be suspicious of you , or the thieves night think you were one of us . At least you 'd be one less to share things with . We 'd have to have a name for the marker on your grave . Shame to bury a man without Irav'ing something to show where he passed . "  | He put down his cup . " Maybe I should be ridin ' on , " he said , " ride while it 's cool , y ' know ? " He got to his feet very carefully . He started to brush off his pants , which would put his hand near his gun , and then thought the better of it . " Mount up , " I said , " and ride . When you see Fletcher , tell him to come anytime he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walked down from our breakfast fire carrying a piece of bread , and when I reached the corral gate , I held it out to the black stallion . He shied away , tossing his head and rolling his eyes , but I talked quietly and held the bread out to him . One of the mares came up and reached for it , and I broke off a bit and let her have it . This mare was one that had been handled quite a bit , I thought . Anyway , she took the bread from my hand . The stallion seemed interested , but he was wary . I talked to him a little , but he held off , and finally I left the bread on the top rail of the gate and went away . I suspect the mare got it , but did not know . Jacob was getting up from the fire , holding his cup in his hand . " I figure we should move ' em , " he said . " I do n't like that crowd . " " Me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had something in mind last night . I think they were out there , ready to come in . I think he was going to start it . " " Martin saw something moving out there , and the horses were restless . " Jacob sipped his coffee , his eyes on the scattered oaks along the mountainside . " Maybe it 's the Injun stories , but I do n't like this place . Or maybe it is just that I want to go back . I 'd never have believed it , but that woman 's got me thinkin ' of business , wheelin ' an ' deal in ' like she does . It 's like poker , only it takes longer to rake in the pot . " IIr looked at me , a faint twinkle of humor in his eyes . 11I  | " Anybody told me I was becoming a city man , I 'd of been ready to shoot him , but there it is . " My thoughts were on Meghan , and I agreed . " Why not ? " But when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There was a place back there where a creek came down a canyon , with oaks on the mountainsides . I wanted to ride up that canyon alone sometime and drink out of that stream . Ramon came up to the fire , leading a line-back dun from the herd . It was a horse to which he had given special attention . He dropped the reins , and getting his cup , poured coffee from the blackened pot . The others had gone , wandering off to catch up their horses . Most of them had already rolled their beds . " We go now ? " " Jacob does not like it here . " " And you ? " " I like it . " Nodding toward the hills , I said , " There is something up there for me . And in the desert there is something . " " You come back ? " " When I can . " I threw the rest of my coffee on the ground . " It is an old place . I can feel that . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I look at those mountains , I see the centuries pass like seasons . " My father often said that men talk of what they call the Old World . ' It is no older than this , if as old . Men had the Bible and they had the Greeks . They knew of the Egyptians and Babylon , so when the scholars began to dig , it was to find familiar things , things of which they had read . Whatever they found tied into something , and when they found something strange , they shied from it because it would have no place , no connection . " Who knows when men first came here ? Who knows how many people were here before you whom we call Indians ? So much decays . So much disappears in the passage of years . " " You must come back . " The coals had burned down to nothing , only a few faint .  | fingers of smoke rising . I looked at the dying red of the coals and thought of Meghan . Did she ever think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a boy who had sat beside her . I looked around . What would she think of my desert ? Of these , my mountains ? Was it vain to think of them as mine ? Yet they were mine in a secret place in my mind . They were mine because I belonged to them and them to lire . Or was this simply a romantic idea I had because my lather and mother had sought a refuge in the desert ? Taking up my saddle , I kicked sand over the coals . " You are one of us . " " I am Johannes Verne . Beyond that I know nothing . What I am to be is something I must become . I must create myself from this that I have . " I glanced around at him . " We are nothing until we make ourselves something . " " No doubt . " " I do not know what I shall be except that I wish to be something , to be someone . " " Before the world ? Before other men ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wish Is to be complete in myself . " Ramon took up his saddle . " Not too complete  --  to be tin ) complete is often to be lonely . A man needs a woman , and a woman a man . It is the way of things . " We walked down to the corral and caught up our horses . ancisco was there , and he walked over to me . " You Will take the stallion ? He is trouble , I think . " " Let him be my trouble . If he escapes , let him go . " Monte walked over to me . Jacob was already in the saddle . " We 're going to let out a few of the tame ones ' first , and I think the others will go to them with a mite of urging . We 'll head them toward Tejon Pass . " " ' They 'll be watching , " I said . " They may try to stampt'dc the horses . " " Maybe , but I think they will try to steal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wo n't have men enough to handle a herd of this size . Or the horses . " We let a few of the horses out , and Francisco and Niue tin headed them off and held them ; then we let a few  | more out and they fled at once to join them . After a few minutes we let out some more , and then some more , and Jacob led off , leading the herd down the old Indian trail . Francisco and Martin flanked them , and we let out more and then more . By the time we let the stallion out , the herd was trailing along in good shape , with Jaime and Diego falling in beside them . His mares were already with the herd , so the black stallion went after them and we closed in . Selmo started from habit to close the gate . " Leave it , " I said . " Other animals will want to get to the water . " " Of course , " he agreed . Monte McCalla was waiting . He had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " We 'll sort of bring up the rear , " Monte said , " just in case we have visitors . " Ramon had mounted up and disappeared , and when I looked around for Alejandro , I did not see him . " Scoutin ' , " Monte said . " He thought he 'd have a look around , but he 'll be along . " A dapple-gray mare had taken the lead . She was older , and had been saddled and ridden in some bygone time . There was a strange brand on her shoulder that we could not make out . When she shed some more of her winter hair , we would see it better . " You going to ride that stallion ? " Monte asked . " Sooner or later , " I admitted . " When the time seems right . " " Give it plenty of time , " Monte advised . " He 's a fighter . " We kept them moving at a good gait . " Get them tired , " Jacob had said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest . " The trail we followed was old , leading through low hills crested with boulders . Larger rocks were scattered across the low ground among the hills . There were only scattered oaks , but the grass was good . Selmo was bringing up the rear , close behind the last of the horses . Monte and I fell back . " You ever been in a fight , kid ? " he asked me.  | " I lived through a couple , loading guns for my pa . Miss NJesselrode was there , too . " " Her ? In a fight ? " I told him about the Indian she had killed trying to crawl into the wagon . " And that was n't the only one , " I told him . " She can shoot . " " I 'll be damned . You 'd think she 'd faint at the sight of blood . " " Not her , " I said . Late in the afternoon we slowed the pace and let the horses scatter out a bit . There was good grass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ate and they drank a l i t t le , and we moved them on . Alejandro came up to us just as we were going into camp . There was an old horse corral , half of natural boulders and pieced out with poles . We let them graze a little more and then bunched them into the corral . There was room enough for all of them , but not much more . Each of us roped another horse and picketed them outside for easy access in case of trouble . I chose a dark apple-gray that I had been watching . Martin put together a small fire and Francisco squatd on his heels nearby . " They come , " Francisco said . " You 've seen them ? " " ' They come . Maybe tonight , maybe tomorrow . " Well , we had understood that . We had known they ould come , and we were ready , as ready as anyone can When it was not quite dark , I took my rifle and went wn to the corral with a couple of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with the black stallion looking on . I held l a piece to him and he took a step forward , then shied way . The mare wanted it , but I would not give it to her . Francisco came over to me . " There are Mohaves out Vt Surprised , I said , " Mohaves ? Indians ? " " Si . Maybe ten , maybe twelve . " Mohaves , too ? I thought about that . Were they workMg with Fletcher ? Or were they on their own ? More
