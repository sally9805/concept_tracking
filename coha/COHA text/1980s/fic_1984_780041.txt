 | any further ; he 's on the bench and could n't back it up ; his own conduct would be suspect . My employer is completely ignorant  --  angry as hell and confused  --  but I 've calmed him down . It 's a closed issue ; the less it 's explored , the better for us all . " Joel opened the door for Leifhelm . " Till tomorrow ? " He paused for a brief moment , loathing the man standing in front of him but showing only respect in his eyes . " Field Marshal , " he added . " Gute Nacht , " said Erich Leifhelm , nodding his head sharply once in military acknowledgment . Converse persuaded the switchboard operator to send someone into the dining room for the American , Commander Fitzpatrick . The task of finding the naval officer was not easy , for he was not in the dining room or the bar but outside on the Spanische Terrasse having a drink with friends , watching the Rhine at twilight .

" asked Converse , his lawyer 's antenna struck by a signal . " Maybe  --  thirty , forty years younger , " replied Connal with less elaboration . " Get up here , sailor ! " Fitzpatrick leaned forward on the couch , his elbows on his knees , his expression a mixture of concern and astonishment as he looked over at Joel , who was smoking a cigarette in front of the open balcony doors . " Let me run this again , " he said warily . " You want me to stop someone from getting your service record ? " " Not all of it , just part of it . " " Who the hell do you think I am ? " " You did it for Avery  --  for Press . You can do it for me . You have to ! " " That 's backwards . I opened those files for him , I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's control . You 've got access ; you 've got a key . " " I 'm here , not there . I ca n't scissor something out you do n't like ten thousand miles away . Be reasonable ! " " Somebody can , somebody has to ! It 's only a short segment , and it 's got to be at the end . The final interview . " " An inten'ic'u ' . ' " said Connal , startled , getting to his feet . " In a service record ' You mean some kind of operational report ? Because if you do , it would n't be - "  | " Not a report , " interrupted Converse , shaking his head . " The discharge  --  my discharge interview . That stuff Press Halliday quoted to me . " " Wait a minute , wait a minute ! " Fitzpatrick held up his hands . " Are you referring to the remarks made at your discharge hearing ? " " Yes , that 's it . The hearing ! " " Well , relax . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyone else 's . " " Halliday had them Avery had them ! I just told you , he quoted my words verbatim ! " Joel walked to a table where there was an ashtray ; he crushed out his cigarette . " If they 're not part of the record , how did he get them ? How did you get them for him ? " " That 's different , " said Connal , obviously remembering as he spoke . " You were a POW , and a lot of those hearings were put under a debriefing classification , and I do mean classified . Even after all these years , many of those sessions are still touchy . A lot of things were talked about that no one to this day wants made public  --  for everyone 's good , not just the military 's . " " But you got them ! I heard my own words , goddamn it ! " " Yes , I got them , " admitted the Navy lawyer without enthusiasm . " I got the transcript , and I 'd be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You see , I believed Press . He swore to me he needed it , needed everything . He could n't make any mistakes . " " How did you do it ? You were n't even in San Diego at the time , that 's what you said ! " " By calling the vaults and using my legal-release number to have a photostat made . I said it was a Four Zero emergency and I 'd take responsibility . The next morning when the authorization came in by pouch for countersignature , I had the chief legal officer at the base sign it with a lot of other things . It simply got buried in the paper work . " " But how did you know about it in the first place ? " " Selected POW records have flags on their discharge sheets . " " Clarification , please ? " " Just what I said , flags . Small blue seals that denote additional information still held under tight security . No flags , everything 's clean ; but if there is one , that means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said he had to have whatever it was , so I went after it . " " Then anyone else could , too . " " No , not , anyone . You need an officer with a legal-release number , and there are n't that many of us . Also there 's a minimum forty-eight-hour delay so the material can be vetted . That 's almost always in the area of weapons and technology data that still might be classified . " " Forty-eight ? " Converse swallowed as he tried to count the hours since  | Paris , since the first moment his name had surfaced . " There 's still time ! " he said , his voice taut , his words clipped . " If you can do it there 's still time . And if you can , I 'll tell you everything I know because you 'll deserve it . No one will deserve it more . " " Spell it out . " Joel turned aimlessly , shaking his head . " That 's funny . I said the same thing to Avery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . Sorry , his name was Press . " Converse turned back to the Navy lawyer , a military lawyer with a mystifying military privilege called a legal-release number . " Listen to me and hear me clearly . A few minutes ago something happened that I was n't sure would or could happen  --  something your brother-in-law was killed to prevent . Tomorrow at four o'clock in the afternoon I 'm going to walk into the midst of that group of men who 've come together to promote a kind of violence that 'll stun this world , toppling governments , allowing these same men to step in and fill the voids . They 'll run things their way , shape the laws their way . One big Supreme Court , each chair owned by a fanatic with specific convictions as to who and what has value and who and what does n't , and those who do n't can go to hell , no appeals on the agenda . ... I 'm going to meet them face-to-face ! I 'm going to talk with them , hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fox you 've ever heard of in a chicken coop  --  only , in this case it 's a vultures ' nest , and I mean the type that swoops down and tears the flesh off your back with one pass . But I 've got something going for me : I 'm one hell of a good lawyer , and I 'll learn things they wo n't know I 've learned . Maybe enough to piece together a couple of cases that will blow it all apart  --  blow them apart . I told you before that I rejected your deadline . I still reject it , but now it does n't seem so out of the question . Certainly not two days , but perhaps not ten ! You see , I thought I was going to have to fly to Tel Aviv , then Johannesburg . Prime everyone , frighten them . Now I do n't have to ! We 've already done it ! They 're coming to me because they 're the ones who are frightened now ! They do n't know what to think , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sweat forming on his hairline ; then he added , " I do n't have to tell you what a good lawyer can do with panicked hostile witnesses . The materials he can collect for evidence . " " Your plea 's accepted , counselor , " said Fitzpatrick , not without awe . " You 're convincing . Now , tell me why my intercession can help ? What does it accomplish ? " " I want those men to think I 'm one of then- ! I can live with everything they can put together about me Pin not proud of it all ; I 've made my compromises  --  hut I can ' t live wit lc that transcript of my discharge ! I ) o n't you see 1 It 's what Avery - Press unclerstcxrd ! I understand now 1 le  | knew me nearly twenty-five years ago , and when I think back we were actually pretty damned good friends . And no matter what happened to us individually , he was banking on the fact that I had n't really changed that much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we reach the voting age we 're pretty well set , all of us . The real changes come later , much later , dictated by such things as acceptance or rejection and the state of our wallets  --  the prices we pay for our convictions , or to support our talents , defending success or explaining failure . That transcript confirmed what Halliday believed , at least enough to make him want to meet me , talk with me , and finally to recruit me . Only , he did it  --  finally  --  by dying as I held his head . I could n't walk away after that . " Connal Fitzpatrick was silent as he walked out on the balcony . He leaned over and gripped the railing as Converse watched him . Then he stood up , raised both his hands , and pulled back the sleeve of his left wrist . " It 's twelve-fifteen in San Diego . No one in legal goes to lunch before one o'clock ; the Coronado 's bar does n't begin to jump until then . " " Can you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said the naval officer , crossing through the French doors toward the telephone . " No , damn it , if you 've got your times straight , I can do better than try , I can issue an order . That 's what rank 's all about . " The first five minutes were excruciating for Joel . There were delays on all overseas calls , but somehow the bi- , tri- , or quadri-lingual Fitzpatrick , speaking urgently , unctuously , in German , managed to get through , the word dringend repeated frequently . " Lieutenant Senior Grade Remington , David . Legal Division , SAND I'AC . This is an emergency , sailor , Commander Fitzpatrick calling . Break iii if the lines are occupied . " Connal covered the mouthpiece and turned to Converse . " If you 'll open my suitcase , there 's a bottle of bourbon in the middle . " " I 'll open your suitcase , Commander . " " Remington ? ... Hello , David , it 's Connal . . . . Yes , thanks very much , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ San Francisco , do n't call me there . But something 's come up I want you to handle , something on my calendar that I did n't get to . For openers , it 's a Four Zero emergency . I 'll fill you in when I get back , but until I do you have to take care of it . Got a pencil ? .. There 's a POW service record under the name of Converse , Joel , I . icutenant , qne and a half stripes , Air Arm , pilot  --  carrier-based , Vietnam duty . He was discharged in the sixties " ? Fitzpatrick looked down at Converse , who held up his right hand and three fingers of his left ? " nineteen sixty-eight , to be exact . " Joel stepped forward , his spread right kind still raised , his kit now showing only the index finger . " June of ' 68 , "  | added the Navy lawyer , nodding . " Point of separation our old hometown , San Diego . Have you got all that ? Read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Connal nodded sporadically , as he listened . " C-O-N-V-E-R-S-E , that 's right . . . . June , ' 68 , Air Arm , pilot , Vietnam , POW section , San Diego separation ; that 's it , you 've got it . Now here 's the wicket , David . This Converse 's SR is flag status ; the flag pertains to his discharge hearing , no weapons or high tech involved . . . . Listen carefully , David . It 's my understanding that there may be a request pending accompanied by a legal-release code for the discharge transcript . Under no circumstances is that transcript to be released . The flag stays fixed and ca n't be removed by anyone without my authorization . And if the release has been processed it 'll still be within the forty-eight-hour vet-delay . Kill it . Under-stood ? " Again Fitzpatrick listened , but instead of nodding , he shook his head . " No , not under any circumstances . I do n't care if the secretaries of State , Defense , and the Navy all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answer is no . If anyone questions the decision , tell him I 'm exercising my authority as Chief Legal Officer of SAND PAC . There 's some goddamned article in the shoals ' that says a station CLO can impound materials on the basis of conceivably privileged information relative to the security of the sector , et cetera , et cetera . I do n't recall the time element ? seventy-two hours or five days or something like that  --  but find that statute . You may need it . " Connal listened further , his brows creasing , his eyes straying to Joel . Ile spoke slowly as Converse felt the sickening ache again in his chest " Where can you reach me . . . ? " said the naval officer , perplexed . Then suddenly he was no longer bewildered . " I take back what I said before , call Meagen in San Francisco . If I 'm not with her and the kids , she 'll know where to reach me . . . . Thanks again , David . Sweep your decks and get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll tell Meg . " Fitzpatrick hung up the phone and exhaled audibly . " There , " he said , slouched in relief , pushing his hand through his loose light-brown hair . " I 'll phone Meagen and give her this number , tell her to say I 've gone up to the Sonoma hills , if Remington calls  --  Press had some property there . " " Give her the telephone number , " said Joel , " but do n't tell her any thing else . " " Do n't worry , she 's got enough on her mind . " The naval officer looked at Converse , frowning . " If your hourly count is right , you 've got your time now . " " My count 's all right . Is Lieutenant Remington ? I mean that only in the sense that he would n't let anyone override your order , would he ? "  | " Do n't mistake my officiousness where he 's concerned , " replied Connal . " David is n't easily pushed around . The reason I chose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the department is that he 's got a reputation for being a stickler prick . He 'll find that statute and nail it to the forehead of any four-striper who tries to countermand that order . I like Remington ; he 's very useful . He scares the hell out of people . " " We all have case partners like that . It 's called the good guy  --  bad guy routine . " " David fits . He 's got an eye that keeps straying to the right . " Fitzpatrick suddenly stood erect , his bearing military . " I thought you were going to get the bourbon , Lieutenant ? " " Yes , sir , Commander ! " shot back Joel , heading for Fitzpatrick 's suitcase . " And if I remember correctly , after you pour us a drink , you 're going to tell me a story I want very much to hear . " " Aye , aye , sir ! " said Converse , lifting the suitcase off the floor and putting it on the couch . " And if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " a room-service dinner might be in order . I 'm sure the Commander needs nourishment after his trying day at the wheel . " " Good thinking , Lieutenant . I 'll phone down to the Empfang . " " Before calling your bookie , may I also suggest that you first call your sister ? " " Oh , Christ , I forgot ! " Chaim Abrahms walked down the dark street in Tel Aviv , his stocky frame draped in his usual safari jacket , boots beneath his khaki trousers , and a beret covering his nearly bald head . The beret was the only concession he made to the night 's purpose ; normally he enjoyed being recognized , accepting the adulation with well-reheatsed humility . In daylight , his head uncovered and held erect , and wearing his familiar jacket , he would acknowledge the homage with a nod , his eyes boring in on his followers . " First a Jew ! " was the phrase with which he was always greeted , whether in Tel Aviv or Jerusalem , in sections of Paris and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years ago when as a young terrorist for the Irgun he had been condemned to death in absentia by the British for the slaughter of . a Palestinian village , with the Arab corpses put on display for Nakama ! He had then issued a cry heard around the world : " I am first a dew , a son of Abraham ! All else follows , and rivers of blood will follow if the children of Abraham are denied ! " The British , in 1948 , not caring to create another martyr , commuted  | his sentence and gave him a large moshay . Yet the acreage of the settlement could not confine the militant sabra . Three wars had broken his agricultural shackles as well as unleashing his ferocity  --  and his brilliance in the field . It was a brilliance developed and refined through the early years of racing with a fugitive , fragmented army , for which the tactics of surprise , shock , hit and melt away were constant , when being outmanned and outgunned were the accepted odds but only victory was the acceptable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of those years to the ever-expanding war machine that became the Army , Navy , and Air Force of a mighty Israel . Mars was in the heavens of Chaim Abrahm 's vision and , the prophets aside , the god of war was his strength , his reason for being . From Ramat Aviv to Har Hazeytim , from Rehovot to Masada of the Negev , Nakama ! was the cry . Retribution to the enemies of Abraham 's children ! If only the Poles and the Czechs , the Hungarians and the Romanies , as well as the haughty Germans and the impossible Russians , had not immigrated to his country by such tens of thousands . They arrived and the complications came with them . Faction against faction , culture against culture , each group trying to prove it was more entitled to the name Jew than the others . It was all nonsense ! They were there because they had to be ; they had succumbed to Abraham 's enemies , permitted ? yes , permitted  --  the slaughter of millions rather than rising as millions and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their civilized ways could bring them , and how much their Talmudic convolutions could earn them . So they came to the Holy Land  --  their Holy Land , so they proclaimed . Well , it was n't theirs . Where were they when it was being clawed out of rock and arid desert by strong hands with primitive tools ? Biblical tools ? Where were they when the hated Arab and the despised English first felt the wrath of the tribal Jew ? They were in the capitals of Europe , in their banks and their fancy drawing rooms , making money and drinking expensive brandy out of crystal goblets . No , they came here because they had to ; they came to the Holy Land of the sabra . They brought with them money and dandy ways and elegant words and confusing arguments and influence and the guilt of the world . But it was the sabra who taught them how to fight . And it was a sabra who would bring all Israel into the orbit of a mighty new alliance . Abrahms reached the intersection of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , their light hazy . It was just as well ; he should not he seen Ile had another block to go , to an address on Jabotinsky , an ** apartment house where there was an undistinguished flat Icuurd by a man who appeared to he no more than an unimportant  | bureaucrat . What few realized , however , was that this man , this specialist who operated sophisticated computer equipment with communications throughout most of the world , was intrinsic to the global operations of the Mossad , Israel 's intelligence service , which many considered the finest on earth . He , too , was a sabra . He was one of them . Abrahms spoke his name quietly into the mouthpiece above the mail slot in the outer lobby ; he heard the click in the lock of the heavy door and walked inside . He began the climb up the three flights of steps that would take him to the flat . " Some wine , Chaim ? " " Whisky , " was the curt reply . " Always the same question and always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I say Some wine , Chaim ? ' and you say one word . Whisky , ' you say . You would drink whisky at the Seder , if you could get away with it . " " I can and I do . " Abrahms sat in a cracked leather chair , looking around the plain , disheveled room with books everywhere , wondering , as he always did , why a man with such influence lived this way . It was rumored that the Mossad officer did not like company , and larger , more attractive quarters might invite it . " I gathered from your grunts and coughs over the telephone that you have what I need . " " Yes , I have it , " said the specialist , bringing a glass of very good Scotch to his guest . " I have it , but I do n't think you 're going to like it . " " Why not ? " asked Abrahms , drinking , his eyes alert over the rim of the glass and fixed on his host as the latter sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and what 's confusing in this business is to be approached delicately . You are not a delicate man , Chaim Abrahms , forgive the indelicacy of my saying it . You tell me this Converse is your enemy , a would-be infiltrator , and I tell you I find nothing to support the conclusion . Before anything else , there must be a deep personal motive for a nonprofessional to engage in this kind of deception , this kind of behavior , if you will . There has to be a driving compulsion to strike out at an image of a cause he loathes . Well , there is a motive , and there is an enemy for which he must have great hatred , but neither is compatible with what you suggest . The information , incidentally , is completely reliable . It comes from the Quang Dinh ? " " What in hell is that ? " interrupted the general . " A specialized branch of North Vietnamese  --  now , of course , Vietnamese  --  intelligence . " " You have sources there ? "  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but sufficient to gain a few ears , and voices . There were things we had to know , weapons we had to understand ; they could be turned against us . " " This Converse was in North Vietnam ? " " For several years as a prisoner of war ; there 's an extensive file on him . At first , his captors thought he could be used for propaganda , radio broadcasts , television  --  imploring his brutal government to withdraw and stop the bombing , all the usual garbage . He spoke well , presented a good picture , and was obviously very American . Initially they televised him as a murderer from the skies , saved from the angry mobs by humane troops , then later while eating and exercising ; you see , they were programming him for a violently sudden reversal . They thought he was a soft , privileged young man who could be broken rather easily to do their bidding in exchange for more comfortable treatment  --  after having experienced a period of harsh deprivation . What they learned , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inner lining was made of hard metal , and the odd thing was that as the months went by it grew harder , until they realized they had created  --  created was their word  --  a hellhound of sorts , somehow forged in steel . " " Hellhound ? Was that their word , too ? " " No , they called him an ugly troublemaker , which , considering the source , is not without irony . The point is , they recognized the fact that they had created him . The harsher the treatment , the more volatile he became , the more resilient . " " Why not ? " said Abrahms sharply . " He was angry . Prod a desert snake and watch him strike . " " I can assure you , Chaim , it is not the normal human response under such conditions . A man can go mad and strike in crazed fury , or he can become reclusive to the point of catatonia , or fall apart weeping , willing to compromise anything and everything for the smallest kindness . He did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inventive series of responses drawing on his own inner resources to survive . He led two escapes  --  the first lasting three days and the second five  --  before the groups were recaptured . As the leader , he was placed in a cage in the Mekong River , but he devised a way to kill the water rats by grabbing them from beneath the surface like a shark . He was then thrown into solitary confinement , a pit ilt the ground twelve feet deep with barbed wire anchored across the top It was from there , during a heavy rainstorm at night , that he clawed his wa tip , bent the wire back and escaped alone . I le made his way south 111101101 the jungles and in the ? river streams for over a hundred miles until hr reached the ? American hues It was no easy feat . They created a savagely 1 1 . , . u , u. lua 4%Wit to rtnttal ' Alt  | " Why did n't they simply kill him before that ? " " I wondered myself , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hanoi , the one who provided the information . He said a strange thing , something quite profound in its way . He said he was n't there , of course , but he thought it was probably respect . " " For an ugly troublemaker ? " " Captivity in war does odd things , Chaim , to both the captured and the captors . There are so many factors at work in a vicious game . Aggression , resistance , bravery , fear , and  --  not the least  --  curiosity , especially when the players come from such diverse cultures as the Occident and the Orient . An abnormal bond is often formed , as much from the weariness of the testing game as from anything else , perhaps . It does n't lessen the national animosities , but a subtle recognition sets in that tells these men , these players , that they are not really in the game by their own choosing . In-depth analyses further show us that it is the captors , not the captured , who first perceive this commonality . The latter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begin to question their absolute authority over the lives and conditions of other men . They start to wonder what it would be like to be in the other player 's shoes . It 's all part of what the psychiatrists call the Stockholm syndrome . " " What in the name of God are you trying to say ? You sound like one of those bores in the Knesset reading a position paper . A little of this , a little of that and a lot of wind ! " " You are definitely not delicate , Chaim . I 'm trying to explain to you that while this Converse nurtured his hatreds and his obsessions , his captors wearied of the game , and as our source in Hanoi suggests , they grudgingly spared his life out of respect , before he made his final and successful escape . " To Abrahm 's bewilderment the specialist had apparently finished . " And ? " said the sabra . " Well , there it is . There is the motive and the enemy , but they are also your motive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course . Ultimately , you wish to smash insurgence wherever it erupts , curb the spread of Third World revolutions , especially Islamic , because you know they 're being fostered by the Marxists  --  read Soviets  --  and are a direct threat to Israel . One way or another it 's the global threat that 's brought you all together , and in my judgment rightfully so . There is a time and a place for a military-industrial complex , and it is now . It must run the governments of the free world before that world is buried by its enemies . " Chaim Abralrnls squinted and tried not to shout . " And ? " " Ca n't you sec ? This Converse is one of you . Everything supports it .  | a highly regarded attorney who makes a great deal of money with a very conservative firm , and his clients are among the wealthiest corporations and conglomerates . Everything he 's been and everything he stands for can only benefit from your efforts . The confusion lies in his unorthodox methods , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not unorthodox in the specialized work he does . Markets can plummet on rumors ; concealment and diversion are surely respected . Regardless , he does n't want to destroy you , he wants to join you . " The sabra put his glass down on the floor and struggled out of the chair . With his chin tucked into his breastbone and his hands clasped behind his back , Abrahms paced back and forth in silence . He stopped and looked down at the specialist . " Suppose , just suppose , " he said , " the almighty Mossad has made a mistake , that there 's something you did n't find . " " I would find that hard to accept . " " But it 's a possibility ! " " In light of the information we 've gathered , I doubt it . Why ? " " Because I have a sense of smell , that 's why ! " The man from the Mossad kept his eyes on Abrahms , as if studying the soldier 's face  --  or thinking from a different viewpoint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If this Converse is not who and what I 've described , which would be contrary to all the data we 've compiled , then he is an agent of his government . " " That 's  --  what I smell , " said the sabra softly . It was the specialist 's turn to be silent . He breathed deeply , then responded . " I respect your nostrils , old friend . Not always your conduct but certainly your sense of smell . What do the others think ? " " Only that he 's lying , that he 's covering for others he may or may not know , who are using him as a scout  --  an infantry point ' was the term used by Palo Alto . " The Mossad officer continued to stare at the sabra , but his eyes were no longer focused ; he was seeing abstract , twisted patterns , convolutions few men would comprehend . They came from a lifetime of analyzing seen and unseen , legitimate and racial enemies , parrying dagger thrusts with countcrthrusts in the blackest darkness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if replying to an unspoken question heard only by himself . " Almost inconceivable , but possible . " " What is ? That Washington is behind hint ? " " Yes " " W Ilv ' " " As ail outrageous alternative I do not subscribe to , but the only one  | left that has the slightest plausibility . Simply put , he has too much information . " " And ? " " Not Washington in the usual sense , not the government in the broader sense , but within a branch of the government a section that has heard whispers about an organization but can not be sure . They believe that if there is such an organization , they must invade it to expose it . So they choose a man with the right history , the right memories , even the right profession to do the job . He might even believe everything he says . " The sabra was transfixed but impatient . " That has too many complications for me , " he said bluntly . " Try it my way first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He 'll have to give you something concrete ; you can force that . Then again he may not because he can not . " " And ? " " And if he ca n't , you 'll know you 're right . Then put as much distance between him and his sponsors as is humanly and brutally possible . He must become a pariah , a man hunted for crimes so insane his madness is unquestioned . " " Why not just kill him ? " " By all means , but not before he 's been labeled so mad that no one will step forward to claim him . It will buy you the time you need . The final phase of Aquitaine is when ? Three , four weeks away ? " " That 's when it begins , yes . " The specialist got up from the chair and stood pensively in front of the soldier . " I repeat , first try to accept him , see if what I said before is true . But if that sense of smell of yours is provoked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been willingly or unwillingly , wittingly or unwittingly , made a provocateur by men in Washington , then build your case against him and throw him to the wolves . Create that pariah as the North Vietnamese created a hellhound . Then kill him quickly , before anyone else reaches him . " " A sabra of the Mossad speaks ? " " As clearly as I can . " ' Flie young Army captain and the older civilian came out of the Pentagon from adjacent glass doors and glanced briefly at each other with no recognition . They walked separately down the short bank of steps and turned left on the cement path that led to the enormous parking lot ; the Army officer was perhaps ten feet ahead of the civilian . Upon reaching the huge asphalt area , each veered in a different direction toward his car .  | If these two men had been the subjects of photographic surveillance during the past fifty seconds , there was no indication whatsoever that they knew each other . The green Buick coupe turned right in the middle of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entrance to the hotel 's underground parking lot . At the bottom of the ramp the driver showed his room key to the attendant , who raised the yellow barrier and waved him along . There was an empty space in the third column of stationary automobiles . The Buick eased into it and the Army captain got out . He circled through the revolving door and walked to a bank of elevators in the hotel 's lower lobby . The panels of the second elevator opened , revealing two couples who had not intended to reach the underground level ; they laughed as one of the men repeatedly pressed the lobby button . The officer , in turn , touched the button for the fourteenth floor . Sixty seconds later he walked out into the corridor toward the exit staircase . He was heading for the eleventh floor . The blue Toyota station wagon came down the ramp , the driver 's hand extended , a room key held out , the number visible . Inside the parking area the driver found an empty space and carefully steered the small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked at his watch . Satisfied , he started toward the revolving door and the elevators . The second elevator was empty , and the civilian was tempted to press the button for the eleventh floor ; he was tired and did not relish the thought of the additional walk . However , there would be other occupants on the way up , so he held to the rules and placed his index finger over the button beside the number 9 . Standing in front of the hotel-room door , the civilian raised his hand , rapped once , waited several beats , then rapped twice more . Seconds later the door was opened by the Army captain . Beyond him was a third mail , also in uniform , the color and the insignia denoting a lieutenant , junior grade , in the Navy . He stood by a desk with a telephone on it . " Glad you got here on time , " said the Army officer . " The traffic was rotten . Our call should be coming through in a few minutes . " The civilian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " What did you find out ahoiit Fitzpatrick ? " he asked . " lies where he should n't he " replied the lieutenant . " Can you bring him back ? "  | " I 'm working on it , but I do n't know where to begin . I 'm a very low man on a very big totem pole . " " Are n't we all ? " said the captain . " Who 'd have thought Halliday would have gone to him ? " asked the naval officer , frustration in his voice . " Or if he was going to bring him in , why did n't he go to him first ? Or tell him about us ? " " I can answer the last two questions , " said the Army man . " He was protecting him from a Pentagon backlash . If we go down , his brother-inlaw stays clean . " " And I can answer the first question , " said the civilian . " Halliday went to Fitzpatrick because in the final analysis , he did n't trust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How ? " asked the captain defensively , but without apology . " We could n't have prevented it . " " No , we could n't , " agreed the civilian . " But we could n't do anything about it afterwards , either . That was part of the trust , and there was no way we could live up to it . We could n't afford to . " The telephone rang . The lieutenant picked it up and listened . " It 's Mykonos , " he said .  | Connal Fitzpatrick sat opposite Joel at the room-service table drinking the last of his coffee . The dinner was finished , the story completed , and all the questions the Navy lawyer could raise had been answered by Converse because he had given his word ; he needed a complete ally . " Except for a few identities and some dossier material , " said Connal , " I do n't know an awful lot more than I did before . Maybe I will when I see those Pentagon names . You say you do n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they 're just there . Beale said a number of them are probably mistakes , but others are n't ; they have to be linked to Delavane . " " They had to be supplied by someone too . There had to be reasons why they were listed . " " Beale called them decision makers ' in military procurements . " " Then I have to see them . I 've dealt with those people . " " You ? " " Yes . Not very often , but enough to know my way around . " " Why you ? " " Basically translating legal nuances from language to language where Navy tech was involved . I think I mentioned that I speak ? " " You did , " Joel broke in . " Goddamn it ! " cried Fitzpatrick , crushing his napkin in a fist . " What 's the matter ? "  | " Press knew I had dealings with those committees , with the technology and armaments boys ! He even asked me about them . Who I saw , who I liked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he come to me ? Of all the people he knew , I was the logical one ! I 'm down the pike and his closest friend . " " That 's why he did n't come to you , " said Converse . " Stupid bastard ! " Connal raised his eyes . " And I hope you hear that , Press . You might still be around to see Connal Two win the Bay Regatta . " " I think you really believe he might hear you . " Fitzpatrick looked across the table at Joel . " Yes , I do . You see , I believe , counselor . I know all the reasons why I should n't  --  Press enumerated them to a fare-thee-well when we were in our cups  --  but I believe . I answered him once with a quote from one of his laid-back Protestant forebears . " " What was that ? " asked Joel , smiling kindly . " There 's more faith in honest doubt than is held by all the archangels in the mind of God . ' " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it before . " " Maybe I did n't get it right . . . . Joel , I 've got to see those names ! " " And I have to get my attache case , but I ca n't go myself . " " Then I 'm elected , " said the Navy man . " Do you think Leifhelm 's right ? You think he can really call off Interpol ? " " I 'm of two thoughts about it . For my immediate maneuverability I hope he can . But if he does , it 'll scare the hell out of me . " " I 'm on your side about that , " agreed Connal , getting out of the chair . " I 'll call the desk and get a taxi . Give me the key to the locker . " Converse reached into his pocket and pulled out the small , rounded key . " Leifhelm 's seen you . He could have you followed ; he did before . " " I 'll be ten times more careful . If I see the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Bierkeller . I know a few here . " Joel looked at his watch . " It 's twenty minutes to ten . Do you think you could swing around to the university first ? " " Dowling ? " " He said he had someone he wanted me to meet . Just walk by him ? or them  --  and say everything 's under control , nothing else . I owe him that much . " " Suppose he tries to stop me ? " " ' I'hcn pull out your II ) and say it 's high priority , or ultrasecret , or whatever bullshit security phrases that come to that very inventive mind of yours "  | " Do I sense a touch of legal envy ? " " No , just recognition . I know where you 're coming from . I 've been there . " Fitzpatrick walked slowly along the wide path on the south facade of the immense university building , once the great palace of the all-powerful archbishops of Cologne . The unimpeded moonlight swelled over the area , reflecting off the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the light stone walls of the majestic structure . Beyond the path the winding gardens of August possessed an eerie elegance ? circles of sleeping flowers , their beauty heightened by the moonlight . Connal was so struck by the tranquil loveliness of the nocturnal setting that he nearly forgot why he was there . The reason was brought sharply back into focus when he saw a slender figure slouched alone on a bench . The man 's legs were extended and crossed at the ankles , his head covered by a soft cloth hat , but not sufficiently to hide the flowing gray-blond hair that protruded slightly over his temples and the back of his neck . So this Caleb Dowling was an actor , thought the Navy lawyer , amused by the fact that Dowling had feigned shock when he realized Connal did not recognize him . But then , neither had Converse ; they were obviously a minority in a world of television addicts . A college professor who had fulfilled the fantasies of youth , a risk-taker , according to Joel , who had won a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think about ; the only sad note was the haunted life of his wife , whom he loved dearly . Also , a marine who had fought in the bloody mess that was Kwajalein was a man to be reckoned with . Fitzpatrick walked over to the bench and sat down several feet away from Dowling . The actor glanced at him , then did a perfectly natural double take , his head snapping . " You ? " " I 'm sorry about last night , " said Connal . " I gather I was n't very convincing . " " You lacked a certain finish , young fella . Where the hell is Converse ? " " Sorry again . He could n't make it , but not to worry . Everything 's A-okay and under control . " " Whose okay and whose control ? " countered the actor , annoyed . " I told Joel to come here , not a cub-scout interlocutor . " " I resent that . I 'm a lieutenant commander in the United States Navy and the chief legal officer at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us which has an element of personal risk for him and the highest priority of classification for us . Back off , Mr. Dowling . We appreciate  --  and 1 speak for Converse as well as myself  --  your interest and  | your generosity , but it 's time for you to recede . For your own benefit , incidentally . " " What about Interpol ? He killed a man . " " Who tried to kill him , " added Fitzpatrick quickly , a lawyer rejoining a negative statement by a witness on the stand . " That will be clarified internally and the charges dropped . " " You 're pretty smooth , Commander , " said Dowling , sitting up . " Better than you were last night  --  this morning , actually . " " I was upset . I 'd lost him and I had to find him . I had to deliver vital information . " The actor now crossed his legs at the knees and leaned back , his arm slung casually over the slatted rim of the bench . " So this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hush-hush operation ? " " It 's highly classified , yes . " " And you and he being lawyers , it 's got something to do with legal irregularities over here that somehow reach into the military , is that right ? " " In the broadest sense , again yes . I 'm afraid I ca n't be any more specific . Converse mentioned that there was someone you wanted him to meet . " " Yes , there is . I said a couple of harsh things about him , but I take them back ; he was doing his thing . He did n't know who the hell I was any more than you did . He 's one smart man , tough but fair . " " I hope you understand that under the circumstances Converse ca n't comply with your request . " " You 'll do , " said Dowling calmly , removing his arm from the back of the bench . Connal was suddenly alarmed . There was movement behind him in the shadowed moonlight ; he whipped his head around , peering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the building from within the pitch-black cover of a doorway the figure of a man began walking across the dark green lawn . An arm thrown casually over the rim of the bench , then just as casually removed . Both movements had been signals ! Identity confirmed ; move in . " What the hell have you done ? " asked the Navy lawyer harshly . " Bringing you two bucks to your senses , " replied Dowling . " If my celebrated instincts are valid , I did the right thing . If they 're wrong , I still did the right thing . " " IT ' hat ' " I ' he man crossing the lawn entered the spill of clear moonlight . He was he.a%vset and wore a dark suit and tic , his scowling , late-middle-aged face  | and straight gray hair gave him the air of a prosperous businessman . It was clear that at the moment he was intensely angry . Dowling spoke as he got up from the bench . " Commander , may I introduce the Honorable Walter Peregrine , United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lieutenant David Remington wiped his steel-rimmed glasses with a silicone-treated tissue , then threw the tissue into a wastebasket and got up from his desk . Returning the glasses to his face , he walked to a mirror secured to the back of his office door and checked his appearance . He smoothed his hair , shoved the knot of his tie in place , and looked down at the failing crease of his trousers . All things considered  --  it was 1730 hours and he had been harassed at his desk since o800 in the morning , including that crazy Four Zero emergency from Fitzpatrick  --  he looked quite presentable . And anyway , Rear Admiral Hickman was not a stickler for spit and polish where the desk corps was concerned . He knew damn well that most of the legal execs would bolt in a minute for much higher paying jobs in the civilian sector if the dress and other disposable codes were taken too seriously . Well , David Remington would n't . Where the hell else could a man travel all over the world , housing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imaginable , with all the medical and dental bills paid for , and not have the terrible pressures of rising in private or corporate practice . His father had been an attorney for one of the biggest insurance companies in Hartford , . Connecticut , and his father had had ulcers at forty-three , a nervous breakdown at forty-eight , his first stroke at fifty-one , and a final , massive coronary at fifty-six ; everyone had said he was so terrific at his job he might even be in line for the presidency . But then , people always said things like that when a man died in the line of corporate duty  --  which men did too goddamned frequently . None of that for David Remington , no sir ! He was simply going to be one of the best lawyers in the U.S. Navy , serve his thirty years , get out at fifty-five with a generous pension , and become a well-paid legal-military consultant at fifty-six . At the precise age when his father died , he would start living very nicely , indeed . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who knew more about naval and maritime law  --  and who stuck to it  --  than any other lawyer in the Navy . If he stepped on toes in his performance , so be it ; it could only enhance that reputation . He did n't give a damn about being popular ; he cared only about being right . And he never made a decision until he was certain of its correct legal position . Consultants like that were prized commodities in civilian practice .  | Remington wondered why Admiral Hickman wanted to see him , especially at this hour when most of the desk corps had gone for the day . There was a court-martial pending that could become a sensitive issue . A black officer , an Annapolis graduate , had been caught selling cocaine off a destroyer berthed in the Philippines ; that was probably it . Remington had pre-prepared the case for the judge advocate , who frankly did not care to prosecute ; the amount was not that large , and others were certainly selling far more , and they were probably white . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there were others , they had not been caught ; if there was evidence , it had not been found . The law was color-blind . He would say the same thing to Hickman . The " stickler prick , " a derisive nickname Remington knew was used behind his back , would stand firm . Well , at fifty-six  --  the age at which his father had been killed by company policy  --  a stickler prick would have all the comforts of an exclusive country club without paying the corporate price . Lieutenant Remington opened the door , walked out into the gray hallway , and started for the elevator that would take him to the office of the highest ranking man at the San Diego naval base . " Sit down , Remington , " said Rear Admiral Brian Hickman , shaking the lieutenant 's hand and indicating a chair in front of the large desk . " I do n't know about you , but this has been what I used to call at your age one fucked-up day . Sometimes I wish Congress would n't appropriate so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a high you 'd think they 'd smoked everything in Tijuana . They forget they 're supposed to have architects before they start bribing the contractors . " " Yes , sir , I know what you mean , sir , " said Remington , sitting down with proper deference as Hickman stood several feet to his left . The mere reference to Tijuana and drugs confirmed his suspicions ; the admiral was about to launch into the everybody-does-it routine , which would lead to " Why should the Navy stir up a racial controversy with something that took place in the Philippines ? " Well , he was prepared . The law  --  naval law  --  was color-blind . " I 'm going to have a well-deserved drink , Lieutenant , " said Hickman , heading for a copper dry bar against the wall . " Can I get you something ? " " No , thank you , sir . " " Hey , look , Remington , I appreciate your staying late for this  --  conference , I guess you 'd call it , but I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd feel foolish drinking by myself , and what we 've got to talk about is n't so almighty important . I just want to ask you a couple of questions . " " Corporate behavior , sir ? I 'll have some white wine , if you have it , sir . "  | " I always have it , " said the admiral with resignation . " It 's usually for personnel who are about to get divorced . " " I 'm happily married , sir . " " Glad to hear it . I 'm on my third wife  --  should have stuck with the first . " The drinks poured , the seating arrangements in order , Hickman spoke from behind the desk , his tie loosened , his voice casual . But what he said evoked anything but casualness in David Remington . " Who the hell is Joel Converse ? " asked the admiral . " I beg your pardon , sir ? " The admiral sighed , the sound indicating that he would begin again . " At twelve hundred hours , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all inquiries regarding a flag on one Lieutenant Joel Converse 's service record . He was a pilot in the Vietnam action . " " I know what he was , sir , " said Remington . " And at fifteen hundred hours , two minutes , " continued Hickman , looking at a note on his desk . " I get a teletype from the Fifth Naval District requesting that the flag be removed in their favor and the material released immediately . The basis for their request was  --  as it always is ? national security . " The admiral paused to sip his drink ; he appeared to he in no hurry , simply weary . " I ordered my adjutant to call you and ask why you did it . " " And I answered him completely , sir , " Remington broke in . " It was at the instructions of the chief legal officer of SAND PAC , and I cited the specific regulation that states clearly that the CLO of a naval base can withhold files on the basis that his own inquiries can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's standard in civil law , sir . The Federal Bureau of Investigation rarely gives a local or metropolitan police force the information it 's collected in an investigation for the simple reason that the investigation could be compromised by leaks or corrupt practices . " " And our chief legal officer , Lieutenant Commander Fitzpatrick , is currently carrying out an investigation of an officer who left the service eighteen years ago ? " " I do n't know , sir , " said Remington , his eyes noncommittal . " I only know those were his orders . They 're in force for seventy-two hours . After that , you , of course , can sign the order of release . And the President , naturally , can do so anytime in a national emergency . " " I thought it was forty-eight hours , " said Hickman . " No , sir . The forty-eight hours is standard with the release of every flag regardless of who asks for it  --  except , of course , the President . It 's called the vet delay . Naval @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | G-Two to make sure there 's no material being released that 's still considered classified . That procedure has nothing to do with the prerogatives of a chief legal officer . " " You know your law , do n't you ? " " I believe as well as any attorney in the United States Navy , sir . " " I see . " The admiral leaned back in his upholstered swivel chair and placed his legs on the corner of the desk . " Commander Fitzpatrick 's off the base , is n't he ? Emergency leave , if I recall . " " Yes , sir . He 's in San Francisco with his sister and her children . Her husband was killed in a robbery in Geneva ; the funeral 's tomorrow morning , I believe . " " Yes , I read about it . Goddamned lousy . . . . But you know where to reach him . " " I have the telephone number , yes , sir . Do you want me to call him , Admiral ? Apprise him of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Hickman , shaking his head . " Not at a time like this . They can dry their mops at least until tomorrow afternoon . I 've got to assume they also know the regulations ; if security 's so damned jeopardized , they know where the Pentagon is  --  and the latest rumor out of Arlington is that they found out where the White House is . " The Admiral stopped , frowned , and looked over at the lieutenant . " Suppose you did n't know where to reach Fitzpatrick ? " " But I do , sir . " " Yes , but suppose you did n't ? And a legitimate request was received ? below presidential involvement , but still pretty damned urgent you could release that flag , could n't you ? " " Theoretically , as next in authority , yes I could . As long as I accepted the legal responsibility for my judgment . " " The what ? " " That I believed the request was sufficiently urgent to override the chief legal officer 's prior order , which granted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was adamant , sir . Frankly , short of presidential intervention , I 'm legally bound to uphold the CLO 's privilege . " " I 'd say morally , too , " agreed Hickman . " Morality has nothing to do with it , sir . It 's a clear legal position . Now , skill I make that call , Admiral ? " No , the hell with it . " Hickman removed his feet from the desk . " I was just curious and , frankly , you 've convinced me . Fitz would n't have given you the order unless he had a reason . The Fifth D can wait three days , unlrar those boys want to run up telephone bills to Washington . "  | " May I ask , sir , who specifically made the request ? " The admiral looked pointedly at Remington . " I 'll tell you in three days . You see , I 've got a man 's privilege to uphold too . You 'll know then anyway , because in Fitz 's absence you 'll have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lieutenant understood . The conference was over . Remington got up and returned the half-filled wineglass to the copper bar ; he stood at attention and spoke . " Will that be all , sir ? " " Yes , that 's it , " said the admiral , his gaze straying to the window and the ocean beyond . The lieutenant saluted sharply as Hickman brought a casual hand to his forehead . The lawyer then did an about-face and started for the door . " Remington ? " " Yes , sir ? " replied the lieutenant , turning . " Who the hell is this Converse ? " " I do n't know , sir . But Commander Fitzpatrick said the status of the flag was a Four Zero emergency . " " Jesus ... " I Iickman picked up his phone and touched a combination of buttons on the console . Moments later he was speaking to a fellow ranking officer in the Fifth Naval District . " I 'm afraid you 'll have to wait three days , Scanlon . " " Why is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CLO negative holds on the Converse flag as far as SAND PAC is concerned . If you want to go the D.C. route , be my guest . We 'll cooperate . " " I told you , Brian , my people do n't want to go through Washington . You 've had these things happen before . D.C. makes waves , acid we do n't want waves . " Well then , why do n't you tell me why you want the Converse flag ? Who is he ? " " I 'd tell you if I could , you know that . Frankly , I 'm not all that clear on it myself , and what I do know I 've sworn to keep secure . " " Then go to Washington , I 'm standing behind my Chief Legal , who , incidentally , is n't even here . " " I le is n't ? But you talked to him . " " No , to his next in line , a lieutenant named Remington . He took the direct order from the CLO . Believe me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chance and he covered himself with legalities . Around here he 's known as a stickler prick. "  | " Did he say why the negative was put out ? " " He did n't have any idea . Why do n't you call him yourself ? He 's probably still downstairs and maybe you can ? " " You did n't use my name , did you ? " interrupted Scanlon , apparently agitated . " No , you asked me not to , but he 'll know it in three days . He 'll have to sign the release and I 'll have to tell him who requested it . " Hickman paused , then without warning exploded . " What the hell is this all about , Admiral ? Some pilot who was discharged over eighteen years ago is suddenly on everybody 's most-wanted list . I get a departmental priority teletype from the big Fifth D and you follow it up with a personal call , playing the old Annapolis memory game , but you wo n't tell me anything . Then I find out my own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on this Converse flag and labeled it a Four Zero emergency status ! Now , I know he 's got personal problems and I wo n't bother him until tomorrow , and I realize you 've given your word to stay secure , but goddamn it , somebody had better start telling me something ! " There was no response from the other end of the line . But there was the sound of breathing ; and it was tremulous . " Scanlon ! " " What did you just say ? " said the voice of the admiral thirty-six hundred miles away . " I 'm going to find out anyway ? " " No , the status . The status of the flag . " Scanlon could barely be heard . " Four-Zero emergency , that 's what I said ! " The interruption was abrupt ; there was only an echoing click . Admiral Scanlon had hung up the phone . Walter Peregrine , United States ambassador to the Federal Republic of Germany , confronted Fitzpatrick . " What 's your name , Commander ? " " Fowler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ briefly but hard at Dowling . " Lieutenant Commander Avery Fowler , United States Navy . " Again Connal looked at the actor , who stared at him through the moonlight . " I understand there 's some question about that , " said Peregrine , his glare as hostile as Dowling 's . " May I see your identification , please ? " " I 'm not carrying identification , sir . It 's the nature of my assignment not to do so , sir . " Fitzpatrick 's words were rapid , precise , his posture squared and erect . " I want verification of your name , your rank , and your branch of service ! Now ! "  | " The name I 've given you is the name I was instructed to give should anyone beyond the scope of the assignment inquire . " " Whose instructions ? " barked the diplomat . " My superior officers , sir . " " Am I to infer that Fowler is not your correct name ? " " With respect , Mr. Ambassador . My name is Fowler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the service is the United States Navy . " Where the hell do you think you are ? Behind the lines , captured by the enemy ? Name , rank , and serial number  --  that 's all I 'm required to say under the rules of the Geneva Convention ' ! " " It 's all I 'm permitted to say , sir . " " We 'll damn well find out about that , Commander  --  if you are a commander . Also about this Converse , who appears to be a very odd liar  --  one minute the soul of propriety , the next a very strange man on the run . " " Please try to understand , Mr. Ambassador , our assignment is classified . In no way does it involve diplomacy , nor will it impair your efforts as the chief American representative of our government . But it is classified . I will report this conversation to my superiors and you will undoubtedly hear from them . Now , if you gentlemen will forgive me , I 'll be on my way . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are . But if you are who you say , nothing 's compromised . I 'm not a damn fool . Nothing will be said to anyone on the embassy staff . Mr. Dowling insisted on that and I accepted the condition . You and I will be locked in a communications room with a phone on a scrambler and you 're going to place a call to Washington . I did n't take this job at a loss of three-quarters of a million a year to find shoe clerks running an investigation of my own company without my knowing about it . If I want an outside audit , I 'll damn well order it myself ! " " I wish I could comply , sir ; it sounds like a reasonable request . But I 'm afraid I ca n't . " " I 'm afraid you will ! " " Sorry . " " Do as he says , Commander , " interjected Dowling . " As he told you , nothing 's been said to anyone , and nothing will be . But Converse needs protection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he does n't even speak the language . Take Ambassador Peregrine 's offer . He 'll keep his word . " " With respect , sirs , the answer is negative . " Connal turned away and started up the wide path .  | " Major ! " shouted the ambassador , his voice furious . " Stop him ! Stop that man ! " Fitzpatrick looked behind him ; for reasons he could not explain to himself he saw what he never expected to see , and the instant he did , he knew he should have expected it . From out of the distant shadows of the immense , majestic building a man rushed forward , a man who was obviously a military aide to the ambassador  --  a member of the embassy staff ! Connal froze , Joel 's words coming back to him . Those men you saw at the airport , the ones from the embassy ... they 're on the other side . Under almost any other circumstances , Fitzpatrick would have remained where he was and weathered it out . He had n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no laws broken of which he was cognizant , and no one could force him to discuss personal matters where no law had been violated . Then he realized how wrong he was ! The generals of George Marcus Delavane would force him , could force him ! He spun around and ran . Suddenly gunfire erupted . Two earsplitting shots above him ! He dove to the ground and rolled into the shadows of the bushes as a man 's voice roared over the stillness of the night and the sleeping gardens . " You goddamned son of a bitch ! What do you think you 're doing ! " There were further shouts , a further barrage of obscenities , and the sounds of struggle filled the quiet enclave of the university . " You do n't kill a man ! Besides , you bastard , there could be other people ! Do n't say a word , Mr. Ambassador ! " Connal scrambled across the graveled path and spread apart the bordering foliage . In the clear moonlight of the distant bench , the actor Caleb Dowling  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the major who had run out of the shadow , his boot on the supine man 's throat , his hand grasping the man 's extended arm to wrench the weapon free . " You are one dumb son of a bitch , Major ! Or , goddamn you , maybe you 're something else ! " Fitzpatrick got to his knees , then to his feet , and , crouching , raced into the receding darkness of the wide path toward the exit .  | " I did n't have any choice ! " said Connal . He had dropped the attache case on the couch and was sitting in an adjacent chair , leaning forward , still shaking . " Calm down ; try to relax . " Converse walked to the elegant antique hunt table against the wall where there was a large silver tray with whisky , ice and glasses . Joel had learned to make use of room service in English . " You need a drink , " he said , pouring Fitzpatrick 's bourbon . " Do I ever ! I 've never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that what it 's like ? " " That 's what it 's like . You ca n't believe it . It 's unreal , just mindblowing sounds that ca n't really have anything to do with you , until  --  until you see the evidence for yourself . It 's real , it 's meant for you , and you 're sick . There 's no swelling music , no brass horns , just vomit . " Converse brought the naval officer his drink . " You 're omitting something , " said Connal , taking the glass and looking up at Joel . " No , I 'm not . Let 's think about tonight . If you heard Dowling right , the ambassador wo n't say anything around the embassy ? " " I remember , " interrupted Fitzpatrick , taking several swallows of the bourbon , his eyes still on Converse . " It was in one of the other flags . During your second escape a man got killed ; it was sundown . You reached  | him when it happened , and the flag said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , according to this guy  --  a sergeant , I think  --  you circled around in the jungle , caught the North Vietnamese , killed him with his own knife and got his repeating rifle . Then you blew away three other Viets in the area . " Joel held his place in front of the Navy lawyer . He answered the younger man , his voice quiet , his look angry . " I hate descriptions like that , " he said flatly . " It raises all the images I loathe . . . . Let me tell you the way it was  --  like it was , counselor . A kid , no more than nineteen , had to relieve himself , and although we stuck together he had the dignity to go ten or fifteen feet away to take care of his private functions , using leaves because squeezable toilet paper was n't available . The maniac  --  I wo n't use the word ' soldier ' ? who killed him waited for the precise moment , then fired off a burst that cut that kid 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that face in my hands , I heard the cackle , the obscene laughter of an obscene man who personified for me everything I found despicable ? whether North Vietnamese or American . If you want to know the truth , whatever I did I did against both  --  because both were guilty , all of us turned into animals , myself included . Those other three men , those enemies , those uniformed robots , probably with wives and children back in villages somewhere up north , had no idea I got behind them . I shot them in the back , counselor . What would Johnny Ringo say about that ? Or John Wayne ? " Connal was silent as Joel walked over to the hunt table to pour himself a whisky . The Navy lawyer drank , then spoke . " A few hours ago you said you knew where I was coming from because you 'd been there . Well , I have n't been where you were , but I 'm beginning to see where you 're coming from . You really hate everything that Aquitaine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . " Converse turned . " With everything that 's in me , " he said . " That 's why we 've got to talk about tonight . " " I told you , I had no choice . You said the embassy people I saw at the airport were with Delavane . I could n't take the chance . " " I know . Now we 're both running , hunted by our own people and protected by the men we want to trap . We 've got to think , Commander . " The telephone rang twice abrasively . Fitzpatrick leaped from the chair , his initial reaction one of shock . Joel watched him , calming him with his look " Sorry , " said Connal. " 1 ' 111 still edgy . I 'll get it ; I 'll be all right . " The Navy lawyer crossed to the phone and picked it up . la ? " He listened for several seconds , covered the nioutlipiccc and looked at Converse . " It 's the overseas operator . San Francisco Its lcagen. ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his throat suddenly dry , his pulse accelerating . " Meagen ? Yes , I 'm here . What is it ? " Fitzpatrick stared straight ahead as his sister talked ; he nodded frequently , the muscles of his jaw working as he concentrated . " Oh , Christ ! . . . No , it 's all right . I mean it , everything 's okay . Do you have the number ? " Connal looked down at the small telephone table ; there was a message pad but no pencil . He glanced over at Joel , who had already started for the desk and a hotel pen . Fitzpatrick held out his hand , took the pen and wrote out a series of numbers . Converse stood aside , conscious that he was barely breathing , his fingers gripping the glass . " Thanks , Meagen . I know it 's a hell of a time for you ; you do n't need this , but if you have to call again , make it station-tostation , okay ? . . . I will , Meg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Navy lawyer hung up , his hand for a moment remaining on the telephone . " Remington called , did n't he ? " said Joel . " Yes . " " What happened ? " " Someone tried to get the flag on your service record released , " said ( Fitzpatrick , turning , looking at Converse . " lt 's okay . Remington stopped it . " Who was it ? " " I do n't know , I 'll have to reach David . Meagen does n't have any idea what a flag is , much less who you are . The message was only that a release was sought for the flag , ' but he stopped it . " " Then everything 's all right . " " That 's what I said , but it 's not . " " Clarification , goddamn it ! " " There 's a time limit on how long my order stands . It 's only a day or two after the vetting process ? " " Which is forty-eight hours , " interrupted Joel . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after that . You see , you thought this would happen , but frankly I did n't . Whoever 's asking for that flag is n't small potatoes . You could walk out of that meeting and a few hours later your new associates could have that stuff in their hands . Converse the Delavane-hater . Is he now the Delavane-hunter ? " " Call Remington . " Joel went to the French doors , opened them , and walked out on the srnall balcony . Drifting wisps of clouds filtered the mcxmlight , and far to the east there were flashes of heat lightning reminding Converse of the silent artillery fire he and the other escaping prisoners would see in the hills , knowing it was sanctuary but unreachable . He could hear Fitzpatrick inside ; from the sound of his voice he was getting a line  | through to San Diego . Joel reached into a pocket for his cigarettes ; he lighted one . Whether it was the bright glow of the flame that illuminated the movement he did not know , but he looked in the direction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet to his right , a man stood watching him . The figure was a silhouette in the dim light ; he nodded and went back inside . Was the man simply another guest who had coincidentally gone outside for a breath of air ? Or had Aquitaine posted a guard ? Converse could hear the Navy lawyer talking conversationally ; he turned and walked back into the room . Connal was seated in the chair on the other side of the table . He held the phone to his ear with his left hand ; his right held the pen above the message pad . He made a note , then said quickly . " Wait a minute . You say Hickman told you to let it ride but he would n't tell you who specifically made the request ? . . . I see . All right , David , thanks very much . Are you going out tonight ? . . . So if I need you I can reach you at this number . ... Yes , I know , it 's these damn phones up in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're lucky to get a line , forget a clear one . Thanks again , David . Good-bye . " Fitzpatrick hung up the phone and looked strangely , almost guiltily , at Joel . Instead of speaking , he shook his head , breathing out and frowning . " What is it ? What 's the matter ? " " You 'd better get everything you can at that meeting tomorrow . Or is it today ? " " It 's past midnight . It 's today . Why ? " " Because twenty-four hours later that flag will be released to a section in the Fifth Naval District  --  that 's Norfolk , and it 's powerful . They 'll know everything you do n't want them to know about you . The time limit is seventy-two hours . " " Get an extension ! " Connal stood up , helplessness in his expression . " On what basis ? " " What else ? National security . " " I 'd have to spell out the reasons , you know that . " " I do n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cies . You need more time to prepare . A source or a witness has been postponed  --  illness or an injury . Or personal matters  --  goddamn it , your brother-in-law 's funeral , your sister 's grief  --  they 've delayed your prog-ress ! " " I ' ' orgct it , Joel . If I tried that , they 'd tie you in with Press and good-bye Charlie . They killed him , remember ? " " No , " said Converse firmly . " It 's the other way around . It separates its further . "  | " What are you talking about ? " " I 've thought about this , tried to put myself in Avery 's shoes . He knew his every move was being watched , his telephone probably tapped . He said the geography , the Comm Tech  --  Bern merger , the breakfast , Geneva itself , everything had to be logical ; it could n't be any other way . At the end of that breakfast he said if I agreed we 'd talk later . " " So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  it was unavoidable  --  and I think he was going to give me the words to say if someone in Aquitaine asked me about him . He was going to turn everything around and give me the push I needed to reach these men . " " What the hell are you talking about ? " " Avery was going to stamp me with the label I had to wear to get inside Delavane 's network . We 'll never know , but I have an idea he was going to tell me to say that he , A. Preston Halliday , suspected me of being one of them , that he had inserted himself in the Comm Tech  --  Bern merger to threaten me with exposure , to stop me . " " Wait a minute . " Connal shook his head . " Press did n't know what you were going to do or how you were going to do it . " " There was only one way to do it , he knew that ! He also knew I 'd reach the same conclusion once I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his field marshals is to infiltrate Aquitaine . Why do you think all that money was put up front ? I do n't need it and he knew he could n't buy me . But he knew it could be used  --  would have to be used to get inside and start talking , start gathering evidence . . . . Call Remington again . Tell him to prepare an extension . " " It 's not Remington , it 's the commander of SAND PAC , an admiral named Hickman . David said I could expect a call from him tomorrow . I 'll have to figure that one out and phone Meagen back . Hickman 's uptight ; he wants to know who you are and why all the interest . " " How well do you know this Hickman ? " " Fairly well . I was with him in New London and Galveston . He requested me as his CLO in San Diego ; that 's what gave me the stripe . " Converse studied Fitzpatrick 's face , then without saying anything he turned and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interrupt ; he understood . He had seen too many attorneys , himself included , struck by a thought they had to define for themselves , an idea upon which a case might hinge . Joel turned around slowly , haltingly , the dim , abstract shadows of a possibility coming into focus . " Do it , " he began . " Do what I think your brother-in-law might have done . Finish what he might have said but never got a chance to say it .  | Assume he and I had that meeting after the merger conference . Give me the springboard I need . " " As you would say , clarification , please , counselor . " " Present Hickman with a scenario as it might have been written by A. Preston Halliday . Tell him that flag 's got to remain in place because you have reason to believe I was connected with your brother-in-law 's murder . Explain that before Halliday flew to Geneva he came to see you  --  as he did  --  and told you he was meeting me , an opposing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a legal front for some boardroom profiteers . Say he said he was going to confront me . Preston Halliday had a history of causes . " " Not for the past ten or twelve years , he did n't , " corrected Fitzpatrick . " He joined the establishment with a vengeance and with a healthy respect for the dollar . " " It 's the history that counts . He knew that ; it was one of the reasons he came to me . Say you 're convinced he did confront me , and since millions are made out of that business , you think I methodically had him removed , covering myself by being there when he died . I have a certain reputation for being methodical . " Connal lowered his head and ran his hand through his hair , then walked in thought toward the hunt table . He stopped , raised his gaze to one of the racehorse prints and turned back to Converse . " Do you know what you 're asking me to do ? " " Yes . Give me the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those would-be Genghis Khans . To do it you 'll have to go further with Hickman . Because you 're so personally involved and so goddamned angry ? which again is the truth  --  tell him to explain your position to whoever wants the flag released . It 's a nonmilitary matter , so you 're taking what you know to the civilian authorities . " " I understand all that , " said Fitzpatrick . " Everything I say is the truth , as I saw it when I flew over here to find you . Except that I reverse the targets . Instead of being the one who can help me , you 're now the one I want nailed . " " Right on , counselor . And I 'm met by a welcoming committee at L , eifhelm 's estate . " - " Then I guess you do n't see . " ? What ? ? " You 're asking inc to go on record implicating you in first-degree murder . I 'll he branding you as a killer . Once I say it , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know that . 1 ) o it . "  | George Marcus Delavane twisted his torso in his chair behind the desk in front of the strangely colored fragmented map on the wall . It was not a controlled movement ; it was an action in search of control . Delavane did not care for obstructions and one was being explained to him now by an admiral in the Fifth Naval District . " The status of the flag is Four Zero , " said Scanlon . " To get it released we 'd have to go through Pentagon procedures , and I do n't have to tell you what that means . Two senior officers , one from naval intelligence , plus a supporting signature from the National Security Agency ; all would have to appear on the request sheet , the level of the inquiry stated , thus escalating the request to a sector demand . Now , General , we can do all this , but we run the risk ? " " I know the risk , " interrupted Delavane . " The signatures are the risk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Who placed it and why ? " " The chief legal officer of SAND PAC . I Checked him out . He 's a lieutenant commander named Fitzpatrick , and there 's nothing in his record to give us any indication as to why he did it . " " I 'll tell you why , " said the warlord of Saigon . " He 's hiding something . I Ic 's protecting this Converse . " " Why would a chief legal officer in the Navy protect a civilian under these circumstances ? There 's no connection . Furthermore , why would he exercise a Four Zero condition ? It only calls attention to his action . " " It also clamps a lid down on that flag . " Delavane paused , then continued before the admiral could interrupt . " This Fitzpatrick , " he said . " You 've checked the master list ? " " I ie 's not one of us . " " I las he ever been considered ? Or approached ? " " I have n't had time to find out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not part of the line over which the two men spoke . Scanlon could be heard punching a button , his voice clear , officious . " Yes ? " Silence followed , and wconds later the admiral returned to Palo Alto . " It 's Hickman again . " " Maybe he has something for us . Call me back . " " 1 lickman would n't give us anything if he had the slightest idea we existed , " said Scanlon . " In a few weeks , he 'll be one of the first to go . If it were up to me he 'd be shot . " " Call me back , " said George Marcus Delavane , looking at the map of the new Aquitaine on the wall . Chaim Abrahms sat at the kitchen table in his small stone Mediterranean villa in Tzahala , a suburb of Tel Aviv favored by the retired military and  | those with sufficient income or influence to live there . The windows were open and the breezes from the garden stirred the oppressive summer 's night air . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fans in three more , but Chaim liked the kitchen . In the old days he and his men would sit in primitive kitchens and plan raids ; in the Negev , ammunition was often passed about while desert chicken boiled on a wood stove . The kitchen was the soul of the house . It gave warmth and sustenance to the body , clearing the mind for tactics  --  as long as the women left after performing their chores and did not interrupt the men with their incessant trivialities . His wife was asleep upstairs ; so be it . He had little to say to her anymore , or she to him ; she could not help him now . And if she could , she would not . They had lost a son in Lebanon , her son she said , a teacher , a scholar , not a soldier , not a killer by choice . Too many sons were lost on both sides , she said . Old men , she said , old men infected the young with their hatreds and used Biblical legends to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Death , she cried . Death before talk that might avert it ! She had forgotten the early days ; too many forgot too quickly . Chaim Abrahms did not forget , nor would be ever . And his sense of smell was as acute as ever . This lawyer , this Converse , this talk ! It was all too clever ; it had the stench of cold , analytical minds , not the heat of believers . The Mossad specialist was the best , but even the Mossad made mistakes . The specialist looked for a motive , as if one could dissect the human brain and say this action caused that reaction ; this punishment that commitment to vengeance . Too damned clever ! A believer was fueled by the heat of his convictions . They were his only motive , and they did not call for clever manipulations . Chaim knew he was a plainspoken man , a direct man , but it was not because he was unintelligent or lacked subtle perceptions ; his prowess on the battlefield proved otherwise . He was direct because he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of time to pretend and be clever . In all the years he had lived with his convictions he had never met a fellow believer who allowed himself to waste time . This Converse knew enough to reach Bertholdier in Paris . He showed how much more he knew when he mentioned Leifhelm in Bonn and specifically named the cities of Tel Aviv and Johannesburg . What more did he have to prove ? Why should he prove it if his belief was there ? Whey did he not plead his case with his first connection and not waste time ? ... No , this lawyer , this Converse , was from somewhere else . The Mossad specialist said the motive was there for affiliation . He was wrong . The red hot heat of the believer was not there . Only cleverness , only talk . And the specialist had not dismissed Chaim 's sense of smell : As well  | lie should not , as the two sabras had fought together for years , as often as not against the Europeans and their conniving ways  --  those immigrants who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , calling the true inhabitants of Israel uneducated ruffians or clowns . The Mossad specialist respected his sabra brother ; it was in his look , that respect . No one could dismiss the instincts of Chaim Abrahms , son of Abraham , archangel of darkness to the enemies of Abraham 's children . Thank God his wife was asleep . It was time to call Palo Alto . " My general , my friend . " " Shalom , Chaim , " said the warlord of Saigon . " Are you on your way to Bonn ? " " I 'm leaving in the morning  --  we 're leaving . Van Headmer is in the air now . He 'll arrive at Ben Gurion at eight-thirty , and together we 'll take the ten o'clock flight to Frankfurt , where Leifhelm 's pilot will meet us with the Cessna . " " Good . You can talk . " " We must talk now , " said the Israeli . " What more have you learned about this Converse ? " " He becomes more of an enigma , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " So do I , but perhaps not the fraud I thought . You know what my assessment was . I thought he was no more than an infantry point , someone being used by more knowledgeable men  --  Lucas Anstett among them ? to learn far more than they knew or heard rumors about . I do n't discount a degree of minor leaks ; they 're to be anticipated and managed , scoffed at as paranoia . " " Get to the point , Marcus , " said the impatient Abrahms , who always called Delavane by his middle name . He considered it a Hebrew name , in spite of the fact that Delavane 's father had insisted on it for his first son in honor of the Roman Caesar  --  the philosopher Marcus Aurelius , a proselytizer of moderation . " Three things happened today , " continued the former general in Palo Alto . " The first infuriated me because I could not understand it , and frankly disturbed me because it portended a far greater penetration than I thought possible from a sector I thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Israeli broke in . " A firm prohibition was placed on getting part of Converse 's service rec'ord . " " Yes ! " cried Abrahms , in his voice the sound of triumph . " What ? "  | " Go on , Marcus ! I 'll tell you when you 're finished . What was the second calamity ? " " Not a calamity , Chaim . An explanation so blatantly offered it ca n't be turned aside . Leifhelm called me and said Converse himself brought up Anstett 's death , claiming to be relieved , but saying little else except that Anstett was his enemy  --  that was the word he used . " " So instructed ! " Abrahm 's voice reverberated around the kitchen . " What was the third gift , my general ? " " The most bewildering as well as enlightening  --  and , Chaim , do not shout into the phone . You are not at one of your stadium rallies or provoking the Knesset . " " I am in the field , Marcus . Right now ! Please continue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lid down on Converse 's military record is a naval officer who was the brother-in-law of Preston Halliday . " " Geneva ! Yes ! " " Stop that ! " " My apologies , my dear friend . It 's just all so perfect ! " " Whatever you have in mind , " said Delavane " may be negated by the man 's reason . This naval officer , this brother-in-law , believes Converse engineered Halliday 's murder . " " Of course ! Perfect ! " " You will keep your voice down ! " The cry of the cat on a frozen lake was heard . " Again my deepest and most sincere apologies , my general . Was that all this naval officer said ? " " No , he made it clear to the commander of his base in San Diego that Halliday had come to him and told him he was meeting a man in Geneva he believed was involved with illegal exports to illegal destinations . An attorney for profiteers in armaments . He intended to confront this man , this international @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What do we have ? " " A fraud ! " " But on whose side , sabra ? The volume of your voice does n't convince me . " Be convinced ! I 'm right . This Converse is the desert scorpion ! " " What does that mean ? " " Do n't you see ? The Mossad sees ! " " ' fhc Mossad ? " " Yes ! I talked with our specialist and he senses what I smell  --  he admits the possibility ! I grant you , my general , my honored warrior , that he has information that led him to think this Converse might be genuine , that  | he wanted truly to be with us , but when I said I smelled bad meat , he granted one other , exceptional possibility . Converse may or may not be programmed , but he could be an agent for his government ! " " A provocateur ? " " Who knows , Marcus ? But the pattern is so perfect . First , a prohibition is placed on his military record  --  it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he responds in the negative about the death of an enemy  --  not his , but ours , and claims he was his enemy too  --  so simple , so instructable . Finally , it is insinuated that this Converse was the killer in Geneva  --  so orderly , so precisely to his advantage . We are dealing with very analytical minds that watch every move in the chess game , and match every pawn with a king . " " Yet everything you say can be reversed . He could be ? " " He ca n't be ! " cried Abrahms . " Why , Chaim ? Tell me why ? " " There is no heat , no fire in him ! It is not the way of a believer ! We are not clever , we are adamant ! " George Marcus Delavane said nothing for several moments , and the Israeli knew better than to speak . He waited until the quiet cold voice came back on the line . " Have your meeting tomorrow , General . Listen to him and be courteous ; play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that house until I give the order . He may never leave it . " " Shalom , my friend . " " Shalom , Chaim. "  | Valerie approached the glass doors of her studio  --  identical with the doors of her balcony upstairs  --  and looked out at the calm , sun-washed waters of Cape Ann . She thought briefly of the boat that had dropped anchor so frighteningly in front of her house several nights ago . It had not been back ; whatever had happened was past , leaving questions but no answers . If she closed her eyes she could still see the figure of a man crawling up out of the cabin light , and the glow of the cigarette , and she still wondered what that man was doing , what he was thinking . Then she remembered the sight of the two men in the early light , framed by the dark rims of her binoculars  --  staring back at her with far more powerful lenses . Were they novices finding a safe harbor ? Amateurs navigating the dark waters of a coastline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was past . A brief , disturbing interlude that gave rise to black imaginings  --  demons in search of logic , as Joel would say . She tossed her long , dark hair aside and returned to her easel , picking up a brush and putting the final dabs of burnt umber beneath the shadowed sand dunes of wild grass . She stepped back , studied her work , and swore to herself for the fifth time that the oil painting was finished . It was another seascape ; she never tired of them , and fortunately she was beginning to get a fair share of the market . Of course there were those painters in the Roston-Roothbay axis who claimed she had virtually cornered the  | market , but that was rubbish . Indeed her prices had risen satisfactorily as a result of the critical approval accorded her two showings at the Copley Galleries , but the truth was that she could hardly afford to live where she lived and the way she lived without at least a part of Joel 's check every month . Then again , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with an attached twenty-by-thirty-foot studio enclosed by full-length glass doors and with a ceiling that was literally one entire skylight . The rest of the house , the original house , on the northern border of Cape Ann was more rambling-quaint than functional . The initial architecture was early-coastconfusion , with lots of heavy bleached wood and curliques , a balustraded second-story balcony , and outsized bay windows in the front room that were charming to look at and look out but leaked fiercely when the winter winds came off the ocean . No amount of putty or cashing compound seemed to work ; nature was extracting a price for observing her beauty . Still , it was Val 's dream house , the one she had promised herself years ago she would someday be able to afford . She had come back from the Ecole des Beaux Arts in Paris prepared to assault New York 's art world via the Greenwich Village  --  Woodstock route only to have stark reality alter her plans . The family circumstances had always been sufficiently healthy for her to live comfortably , albeit not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Paris . Her father was a passably good if excessively enthusiastic amateur painter who always complained that he had not taken the risks and gone totally into the fine arts rather than architecture . As a result , he supported his only child both morally and financially , in a very real sense living through her progress and devoted to her determination . And her mother  --  slightly mad , always loving , always supportive in anything and everything  --  would take terrible photographs of Val 's crudest work and send the pictures back to her sister and cousins in Germany , writing outrageous lies that spoke of museums and galleries and insane commissions . " The crazy Berlinerin , " her father would say fondly in his heavy Gallic accent . " You should have seen her during the war . She frightened us all to death ! We half expected she would return to headquarters some night with a drunken Goebbels or a doped-up Goring in tow , then tell us if we wanted Hitler to give her the word ! " Her father had been the Free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Berlin . A rather stiff Parisian autocrat who happened to speak ( : crnnan had been assigned to the cell in the Charlottcnhurg , which coordinated all the activities of Berlin 's underground . He frequently said that he had more trouble with the wild Fraulein with the  | impetuous ideas than he had avoiding the Nazis . Nevertheless they married each other two months after the armistice . In Berlin . Where neither his family would talk to hers , nor hers to his . " We had two small orchestras , " her mother would say . " One played pure , beautiful Viennese Schnitzel , the other some white cream sauce with deer droppings . " Whether family animosities had anything to do with it neither ever said , but the Parisian and the Berlinerin immigrated to St. Louis , Missouri , in the United States of America , where the Berlinerin had distant relations . The stark reality . Nine years ago , after she had settled in New York from Paris , a frightened , tearful father had flown in to see her and had told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been ill for years ; it was cancer and it was about to kill her . In desperation , he had spent nearly all the money he had , including unpaid second and third mortgages on the rambling house in Bellefontaine , to stem the disease . Among the profiteers were clinics in Mexico ; there was nothing else he could say . He could only weep , and his losses had nothing to do with his tears . And she could only hold her father and ask him why he had not told her before . " It was not your battle , ma cherie . It was ours . Since Berlin , it was always we two . We fought then together ; we fight now as always  --  as one . Her mother died six days later , and six months after that her father lit a Gauloise on the screened-in porch and mercifully fell asleep , not to wake up . Valerie could not cry . It was a shock but not a tragedy . Wherever he was he wanted to be there . So Valerie Charpentier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not rely on the sales of an unknown artist . What astonished her was not that employment was so easy to find , but that it had very little to do with the thick portfolio of sketches and line drawings she presented . The second advertising agency she applied to seemed more interested in the fact that she spoke both German and French fluently . It was the time of corporate takeovers , of multinational alliances where profits could be made on both sides of the Atlantic by the same single entities . Valerie Charpentier , artist-in-residence inside , became a company hack on the outside . Someone who could draw and sketch rapidly and make presentations and speak the languages and she hated it . Still , it was a remarkable living for a wonaau who had anticipated a period of years before her name on a canvas would mean something . Then a man carne into her life who made whatever affairs she had had totally forgettable A nice man , a decent Haan-even an exciting man ?  | who had his own problems but did not talk about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should have given her a clue . Joel , her Joel , effusive one moment , withdrawn the next , but always with that shield , that facade of quick humor which was often as biting as it was amusing . For a while they had been good for each other . Both were ambitious for entirely different reasons  --  she for the independence that came with recognition , he for the wasted years he could never reclaim  --  and each acted as a buffer when the other faced disappointment or delay . But it all began to fall apart . The reasons were painfully clear to her but not to him . He became mesmerized by his own progress , by his own determination , to the exclusion of everything else , starting with her . He never raised his voice or made demands , but the words were ice and the demands were increasingly there . If there was a specific point when she recognized the downhill slide , it was a Friday night in November . The agency had wanted her to fly to West Berlin ; a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elected to calm the churning waters . She had been packing when Joel came home from work . He had walked into the bedroom of their apartment and asked her what she was doing , where she was going . When she told him , he had said , " You ca n't . We 're expected at Brooks ' house in Larchmont tomorrow night . Talbot and Simon 'll be there too . I 'm sure they 'll talk international . You 've got to be there . " She had looked at him , at the quiet desperation in his eyes . She did not go to Germany . It was the turning point ; the downhill race had begun , and within a brief few months she knew it was quickening to its finish . She quit the agency , giving up authority for the dog days of free-lancing , hoping the extra time she had to devote to him might help . It did not ; he seemed to resent any overt act of sacrifice , no matter how hard she tried to conceal it . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt sorry for him . His furies were driving him and it was obvious that he disliked what was happening ; he disliked what he was but could not help himself . He was on his way to a burnout and she could not help him , either . If there had been another woman , she could have fought , staking out her claim and fiercely insisting on the right to compete , but there was no one else , only himself and his compulsions . Finally , she realized she could not penetrate his shield ; he had nothing left for anyone else emotionally . That was what she had hurled at him : " Emotional burn-out ! " He had agreed in that quiet , kind voice and the next day he was gone . So she took him . Four years , she demanded , the exact amount of time he had taken from her . Those four years of heady generosity were about to come to an end , Val reflected , as she cleaned her brushes and scraped  | the palette . In January they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ posted by the fifteenth . Five weeks ago , during lunch at the Ritz in Boston , Joel had offered to continue the payments . He claimed he was used to them and was making more in salary and bonuses than he could spend soberly . The money was no hardship , and besides it gave him a certain stature among his peers and was a marvelous ploy to avoid prolonged entanglements . She had declined , borrowing words from her father or more likely her mother , saying that things were far better than they were . He had smiled that half-sad yet still infectious smile and said , " If they turn out otherwise , I 'm here . " Goddamn him ! Poor Joel . Sad Joel . He was a good man caught in the vortex of his own conflicts . And Val had gone as far as she could go  --  to go further was to deny her own identity . She would not do that ; she had not done it . She placed her brushes in the tray and walked to the glass doors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was out there , far away , still somewhere in Europe . Valerie wondered if he had given a thought to the day . It was the anniversary of their marriage . To summarize , Chaim Abrahms was molded in the stress and chaos of fighting for daily survival . They were years of neverending violent skirmishes , of outthinking and outliving enemies bent on killing not only whole sabra settlements but the desert Jews ' aspirations for a homeland as well as political freedom and religious expression . It is not difficult to understand where Abrahms came from and why he is what he is , but it is frightening to think about where he is going . He is a fanatic with no sense of balance or compromise where other peoples with identical aspirations are concerned . If a man has a different stripe , whether of the same species or not , he is the enemy . Armed force takes precedence over negotiations in all matters , and even those in Israel who plead for more moderate stands based on totally secure borders are branded as traitors . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ruling kingdom of the entire Middle East . An appropriate ending to this report is a comment he made after the well-known statement issued by the Prime Minister during the Lebanon invasion : " We covet not one inch of Lebanon . " Abrahms ' reply in the field to his troops  --  the majority by no means sympathetic  --  was the following . " Certainly not an inch ! The whole damned country ! Then Gaza , the Golan , and the West Bank ! And why not Jordan , then Syria , and Iraq ! We have the means and we have the will ! We are the mighty children of Abraham ! " He is Delavane 's key in the volatile Middle East .  | It was nearly noon , the overhead sun beating down on the small balcony beyond the French doors . The late-breakfast remnants had been cleared away by room service ; only a silver pot remained on the hunt table . They had been reading for hours since the first coffee was brought to the suite at six-thirty . Converse put down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the armchair . It is not difficult to understand where Abrahms came from . . . but it is frightening to think about where he is going . Joel looked over at Connal Fitzpatrick , who was seated on the couch , leaning forward over the coffee table and reading a single page while making notes on the telephone message pad ; the Bertholdier and I.eifhelm dossiers were in two neat piles on his left . The Navy lawyer had said practically the same words to him , thought Converse , lighting a cigarette . I 'm beginning to see where you ' re coming from .... The inherent question put to Joel 's legal mind was simple : Where was he himself going ? f le hoped to hell he knew . Was he n inept gladiator marching into a Roman arena facing far stronger , better-armed and superior talent ? Or were the demons from his own past turning him into his own sacrifice , leading him into the arena 's hot sand where angry , half-starved cats waited , ready to pounce and tear him apart ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of addressing . He only knew he could not turn hack . Fitzpatrick looked up . " What 's the matter ? " he asked , obviously aware t hat Converse was staring in his direction . " You worried about the admi-ral ? " " Who ? " " Hickman , San Diego . " " Among other things . In the clear light of day , you 're sure he bought the extension ? " " No guarantees , but I told you he said he 'll call me if any emergency heat came down . I 'm damn sure he wo n't do anything before consulting iiie . If he tries to reach me , Meagen knows what to do and I 'll lean harder . I f need be , I 'll claim point of personal privilege and demand a meeting with those unnamed people in the Fifth District , maybe go so far as to imply they could be part of Geneva . That 'd be a full circle . We could end up with a standoff  --  the release of that flag only with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " You wo n't have a standoff if he 's with them . He 'll override you . " " If he was with them , he would n't have told Remington he was going ( o call me . I le would n't have said anything ; he 'd have waited the extra day and let it go . I know him . Ile was n't just nonplussed , he was mad . I lc stands by his people and he does n't like outside pressures , especially Navy pressures . Wc'rc on hold , and as long as it 's hold , the flag 's in place .  | I told you , he 's a lot angrier with Norfolk than with me . They wo n't even give him a reason ; they claim they ca n't . " Converse nodded . " All right , " he said . " Call it a case of nerves on my part . I just finished the Abrahms dossier . That maniac could blow up the whole Middle East all by himself and drag the rest of us in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Bertholdier ? " " As far as the information goes , they 're everything you said and then some . They 're more than just influential ex-generals with fistfuls of money , they 're powerful rallying symbols for what a lot of people think are justifiable extremes . That 's as far as the information goes  --  but the operative word for me is the information itself . Where did it come from ? " " That 's a step back . It 's there . " " It sure is , but how ? You say Beale gave it to you , that Press used the phrase ' we ' ? ' the ones we 're after , ' the tools we can give you , ' the connections as we think they are . ' " " And we went over this , " insisted Joel . " The man in San Francisco , the one he went to who provided the five hundred thousand and told him to build cases against these people legally , and together they 'd turn them into plain and simple profiteers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound reasoning , counselor , and that 's the we . " " Press and this unknown man in San Francisco ? " " Yes . " " And they could pick up a phone and hire someone to put together these ? " Fitzpatrick gestured at the two dossiers on his left . " Why not ? This is in the age of the computer . Nobody today lives on an unmapped island or in an undiscovered cave . " " These , " said Connal , " are not computer printouts . They 're wellresearched , detailed , in-depth dossiers that take in the importance of political nuances and personal idiosyncrasies . " " You have a way with words , sailor . Yes , they are . A man who can forward half a million dollars to the right bank on an Aegean island can hire just about anyone he likes . " " He ca n't hire these . " " What does that mean ? " " Let me take a real step back , " said the Navy lawyer , getting to his feet and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I wo n't reiterate the details of my relationship with Press because right now it hurts a little to think about it " Fitzpatrick paused , seeing the look in Converse 's eyes that rejected this kind of sentimentality in their discussion " Do n't mistake he continued . " It 's not his death ; not the  | funeral ; it 's the other way around . It 's not the Press Halliday I knew . You see , I do n't think he told us the truth , either you or me . " " Then you know something I do n't know , " said Converse quietly . " I know there 's no man in San Francisco that even vaguely fits the description of the image he gave you . I 've lived there all my life , including Berkeley and Stanford , just like Press . I knew everyone he knew , especially the wealthiest and the more exotic ones ; we never held back on those with each other . I was legal worlds away , and he always filled me in if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fun for him . " " That 's tenuous , counselor . I 'm sure he kept certain associations to himself . " " Not those kinds , " said Connal . " It would n't be like him . Not with me . " Well , I ? " " Now let me step forward , " interrupted Fitzpatrick . " These dossiers ? I have n't seen them before , but I 've seen hundreds like them , maybe a couple of thousand on their way to becoming full-fledged versions of t hem . " Joel sat up . " Please explain that , Commander . " " You just hit it , Lieutenant . The rank says it . " " Says what ? " " Those dossiers are the reworked , finished products of intelligence probes utilizing heavy shots of military data . They 've been bounced around the community , each branch contributing its input  --  from straight biographical data to past surveillances to psychiatric evaluation  --  and put together by teams of specialists . Those were taken from way down in the government vaults and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appear as the work of an outside , nongovernment authority . But they 're not . They 've got Classified , Top Secret , and Eyes Only written all over them . " Converse leaned forward . " That could be a subjective judgment based on limited familiarity . I 've seen some very detailed , very in-depth reports put together by high-priced firms specializing in that sort of thing . " " Describing precise military incidents during the time of war ? Pinpointing bombing raids and specifying regiments and battalions and the current strategies employed ? Detailing through interviews the internal conflicts of ranking enemy officers and the tactical reasons for shifting military personnel into civilian positions after the cessation of hostilities ? No firm would have access to those materials . " ' They could be researched , " said Joel , suddenly not convinced himself . " Well , these could n't , " Connal broke in , holding up the page of type-  | written names , his thumb on the lower two columns listing the " decision makers " from the Pentagon and the State Department @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side at maximum  --  but not the rest . These are people above the ones I 've dealt with , men who do their jobs under a variety of titles so they ca n't be reached  --  bribed , blackmailed , or threatened . When you said you had names , I assumed I 'd recognize most of them , or at least half of them . I do n't . I only know the departmental execs , upper-echelon personnel who have to go even higher , who obviously report to these people . Press could n't have gotten these names himself or through others on the outside . He would n't know where to look and they would n't know where to look ? I would n't know . " Converse rose . " Are you sure you know what you 're talking about ? " " Yes . Someone  --  probably more than one  --  deep in the Washington cellars provided these names just as he or they provided the material for those dossiers . " " Do you know what you 're saying ? " Connal stood still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say , " he began grimly . " Press lied to us . He lied to you by what he said , and to me by what he did n't say . You 're tied to a string and it goes right back to Washington . And I was n't to know anything about it . " " The puppet 's in place . . . . " Joel spoke so softly he could barely be heard as he walked aimlessly across the room toward the bright sunlight streaming through the balcony doors . " What ? " asked Fitzpatrick . " Nothing , just a phrase that kept running through my head when I heard about Anstett . " Converse turned . " But if there 's a string , why have they hidden it ? Why did Avery hide it ? For what purpose ? " The Navy lawyer remained motionless , his face without expression . " I do n't think I have to answer that . You answered it yourself yesterday afternoon when we were talking about me  --  and do n't kid yourself , Lieutenant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll give you a name now and then that may open a door . . . but that 's all . ' Those were your words . Freely translated , you were telling yourself that the sailor you took on board might stumble on to something , but in case he was taken by the wrong people , they could n't beat out of him what he did n't know . " Joel accepted the rebuke , not merely because it was justified , but because it made clear a larger truth , one he had not understood on Mykonos . Beale had told him that among those raising questions in Washington were military men who for one reason or another had not pursued their inquiries ; they had kept silent . They had kept silent where they might be  | overheard , perhaps , but they had not totally kept their silence . They had talked in quiet voices until another quiet voice from San Francisco  --  a man who knew whom to reach courtesy of a brother-in-law in San Diego ? made contact . They had talked together , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They needed an infiltrator , a man with the expertise who had a loathing they could fuel and , once fired , send out into the labyrinth . The realization was a shock , but'oddly enough , Joel could not fault the strategy . He did not even fault the silence that remained after Preston I lalliday 's murder ; loud accusing voices would have rendered that death meaningless . Instead , they had stayed quiet , knowing that their puppet had the tools to make his way through the maze of illegalities and do the job they could not do themselves . He understood that , too . But there was one thing Converse could not accept , and that was his own expendability as the puppet . He had tolerated being left unprotected under the conditions outlined by Avery Fowler  --  Preston Halliday , not under these . If he was on a string , he wanted the puppeteers to know he knew it . He also wanted the name of someone in Bonn he could call , someone who was a part of them . The old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been added . In four hours he would be driven through the iron gates of Erich I , eifhelm 's estate ; he wanted someone on the outside , a man Fitzpatrick could reach if he did not come out by midnight . The demons were pressing hard , thought Joel . Still , he could not turn back . He was so close to trapping the warlord of Saigon , so close to making up for so much that had warped his life in ways no one would ever understand . . . . No , not no one , ' he reflected . One person did , and she had said she could not help him any longer . Nor had it been fair any longer to seek her help . " What 's your decision ? " said Connal . " Decision ? " asked Joel , startled . " You do n't have to go this afternoon . Throw it all back ! This belongs Stateside with the FBI in conjunction with the Central Intelligence Agency overseas . I 'm appalled they did n't take that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then stopped . It had to be clear , not only to Fitzpatrick but to himself . He thought he understood . He had seen the look of profound panic in Avery Fowler 's eyes  --  Preston Halliday 's eyes  --  and he had heard the cry in his voice . The lies were his strategy , but the look and the cry were his innermost feelings . " 1 las it occurred to you , Commander , that they ca n't take that route ? That , perhaps , we 're not talking about men who can pick up a phone ? as you said before  --  and put those wheels in motion ? Or if they tried ,  | they 'd have their heads cut off , perhaps literally , with an official rebuke and a bullet in the back of their skulls ? Let me add that I do n't think they 're afraid for themselves any more than I believe they chose the best man for the job , but I do think they came to a persuasive conclusion . They could n't work from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Christ , you 're a cold son of a bitch . " " Ice , Commander . We 're dealing with a paranoid fantasy called Aquitaine , and it 's controlled by proven , committed , highly intelligent and resourceful men , who if they achieve what they 've set out to do will appear as the voices of strength and reason in a world gone mad . They 'll control that world  --  our world  --  because all other options will pale beside their stability . Stability , counselor , as opposed to chaos . What would you choose if you were an everyday nine-to-fiver with a wife and kids , and you could never be sure when you went home at night whether or not your house had been broken into , your wife raped , your kids strangled ? You 'd opt for tanks in the street . " " With justification , " said the Navy lawyer , the two words spiraling quietly off into the air of the sunlit room . " Believe that , sailor . They 're banking on it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on an international scale . It 's only a few days or a few weeks away  --  whatever it is , wherever it is . If I can just get an inkling ... " Converse turned and started for the door of his bedroom . " Where are you going ? " asked Connal . " Beale 's telephone number on Mykonos ; it 's in my briefcase . He 's my only contact and I want to talk to him . I want him to know the puppet has just been granted some unexpected free will . " Three minutes later Joel stood at the table , the phone to his ear as the Greek operator in Athens routed his call to the island of Mykonos . Fitzpatrick sat on the couch , Chaim Abrahms ' dossier in front of him on the coffee table , his eyes on Converse . " Are you getting through all right ? " asked the Navy lawyer . " It 's ringing now . " The erratic , stabbing signals kept repeating  --  four , five , six times . On the seventh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Herete ? " " Dr. Beale , please . Dr. Edward Beale . " " Tee tha thelete ? " " Beale . The owner of the house . Get him for me , please ! " Joel turned to Fitzpatrick . " Do you speak Greek ? " " No , but I 've been thinking about taking it up . "  | " You do that . " Converse listened again to the male voice in Mykonos . Greek phrases were spoken rapidly , none comprehensible . " Thank you ! Good-bye . " Joel tapped the telephone bar several times , hoping the overseas line was still open and the English-speaking Greek operator was still there . " Operator ? Is this the operator in Athens ? . . . Good ! I want to call another number on Mykonos , the same billing in Bonn . " Converse reached down on the table for the instructions Preston Halliday had given him in Geneva . " It 's the Bank of Rhodes . The number is ... " Moments later the waterfront banker , Kostas Laskaris , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Laskaris , this is Joel Converse . Do you remember me ? " Of course .... Mr. Converse ? " The banker sounded distant , somehow strange , as if wary or bewildered . " I 've been trying to call Dr. Beale at the number you gave me , but all I get is a man who ca n't speak English . I wondered if you could tell me where Beale is . " A quiet expulsion of breath could be heard over the phone . " I wondered , " said Laskaris quietly . " The man you reached was a police officer , Mr. Converse . I had him placed there myself . A scholar has many valuable things . " " Why ? What do you mean ? " " Shortly after sunrise this morning Dr. Beale took his boat out of the harbor , accompanied by another man . Several fishermen saw them . Two hours ago Dr. Beale 's boat was found crashed on the rocks beyond the Stephanos . There was no one on board . " I killed him . With a scaling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond the shoals of the Stephanos . Joel hung up the phone . Halliday , Anstett , Beale , all of them gone ? all his contacts dead . He was a puppet on the loose , his strings gone haywire , leading only to shadows .  | Erich Leifhelm 's waxlike skin paled further as his eyes narrowed and his starched white lips parted . Then blood rushed to his head as he sat forward at the desk in his library and spoke into the telephone . " What was that name again , London ? " " Admiral Hickman . He 's the ? " " No , " interrupted the German sharply . " The other one ! The officer who has refused to release the information . " " Fitzpatrick , an Irish name . He 's the ranking legal officer at the naval base in San Diego . " " A Lieutenant Commander Fitzpatrick ? " " Yes , how did you know ? " " Unglaublich ! Diese Stumper ! " " Warum ? " asked the Englishman . " In what sense ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ San Diego , Englander , but he is not in San Diego ! He 's here in Bonn ! " " Are you mad ? No , of course , you 're not . Are you certain ? " " He 's with Converse ! I spoke to him myself . The two are registered in his name at Das Rektorat ! He is how we found Converse ! " ' " I'hcre was no attempt to conceal the name ? " " On the contrary , he used his papers to gain entrance ! " " I tow blcxxly third-rate , " said I An Rion , bewildered . " Or how downright  | sure of himself , " added the Britisher , his tone changing . " A signal ? No one dares touch him ? " " Unsinn ! It 's not so . " " Why not ? " " He spoke to Peregrine , the ambassador . Our man was there . Peregrine wanted to take him , wanted him brought forcibly to the embassy . There were complications ; he got away . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " An obstruction . Some Sehauspieler  --  an actor . Peregrine will not discuss the incident . He says nothing . " " Which means no one will touch his naval officer from California , " concluded London . " There 's a very good reason . " " What is it ? " " He 's the brother-in-law of Preston Halliday . " " Geneva ! Mein Gott , they are into us ! " " Someone is , but not anyone with a great deal of information . I agreed with Palo Alto , who also agrees with our specialist in the Mossad  --  with Abrahms , as well . " " The Jew ? What does the Jew say ? What does he say ? " " He claims this Converse is an agent flying blind out of Washington . " " What more do you need ? " " He is not to leave your house . Instructions will follow . " Stunned , Undersecretary of State Brewster Tolland hung up the phone , sank back in his chair , then shot forward and pressed the appropriate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the female voice . " Code , please ? " " Six thousand , " said Tolland . " May I speak with Consular Operations , Station Eight , please ? " " Station Eight requires ? " " Plantagenet , " interrupted the Undersecretary . " Right away , sir . " " What is it , Six thousand ? " " Cut the horseshit , Harry , this is Brew . What have you got running in Bonn we do n't know about ? " " Off the top of my head , nothing . " " How far off the top is that ? " " No , it 's straight . You 're current on everything we 're doing . There was an I+'RC review yesterday morning , and I 'd remember if there was anything that excluded you . " " You might remember , but if I 'm excluded I 'm out . "  | " That 's right , and I 'd tell you as much if only to keep you out , you know that . What 's your problem ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ambassador , who may just call a very old friend at Sixteen Hundred . " " Peregrine ? What 's his problem ? " " If it 's not you , then someone 's playing Cons Op . It 's supposedly a covert investigation of the embassy  --  his embassy  --  somehow connected with the Navy Department . " " The Navy ? That 's crazy  --  I mean dumb crazy ! Bonn 's a port ? " " Actually , I suppose it is . " " I never heard of the Bismarck or the Graf Spee steaming around the Rhine . No way , Brew . We do n't have anything like that and we would n't have . Do you have any names ? " " Yes , one , " replied Tolland , looking down at a pad with hastily scribbled notes on it . " An attorney named Joel Converse . Who is he , Harry ? " " For Christ 's sake , I never heard of him . What 's the naval angle ? " " Someone who claims to be the chief legal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lieutenant commander . " " Claims to be ? " " Well , before that he passed himself off as a military attache working at the embassy . " " Somewhere the inmates broke out of a home . " " This is n't funny , Harry . Peregrine 's no fool . He may be a vanity appointment , but he 's damned good and he 's damned smart . He says these people are n't only real but may know something he does n't . " " What does he base that on ? " " First , the opinion of a man who 's met this Converse ? " " Who ? " interrupted Harry of Station Eight . " He wo n't say , just that he trusts him , trusts his judgment . This person with no name says Converse is a highly qualified , very troubled man , not a black hat . " " A what ? " " That was the term Peregrine used . Obviously someone who 's okay . " " What else ? " " What Peregrine calls isolated odd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; he says he 'll discuss it with the Secretary or Sixteen I kindred if I ca n't satisfy him . He wants answers fast , and we do n't want to rock the boat over there . " " I 'll try to help , " said I tarry . " Maybe it 's something from Langley or A-lington  --  the bastards ! I can run a check on the Navy 's chief legals ill : ul hour , .111 ( 1 I 'm sure the ABA can tell us who Converse is  --  if he is . At  | " Get back to me . I have n't got much time and we do n't want the White House raising its voice . " " The last thing ever , " agreed the director of Consular Operations , the State Department 's branch of foreign clandestine activities . " Try that on for legal size ! " shouted Rear Admiral Hickman , standing by the window , angrily addressing a rigid , pale-faced David Remington . " And tell me with as few goddamned details as possible how it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sir . I spoke with him yesterday  --  at noon ? and then again last evening . He was in Sonoma ! " " So did I , Lieutenant . And whenever there was a scratching or an echo , what were the words ? All that rain in the hills screwed up the telephone lines ! " " Those were the words , sir . " " He passed through Dusseldorf immigration two days ago ! He 's now in Bonn , Germany , with a man he swore to me had something to do with his brother-in-law 's death . The same man he 's protecting by putting a clamp on that flag . This Converse ! " " I do n't know what to say , sir . " " Well , the State Department does and so do I. They 're pushing through that vet-delay or whatever the hell you called it in your legalese . " " It 's vetted material , sir . It simply means ? " " I do n't want to hear , Lieutenant , " said Hickman , heading back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do you know how much you bastards cost me for the two divorces ? " " I beg your pardon , sir ? " " Never mind . I want that flag released . I brought Fitz on board here . I gave him his striper and the son of a bitch lied to me . He not only lied , he did it ten thousand miles away  --  lying about where he was when he knew he should n't be there without my authorization ! He knew it ! .. Do you have any objections , Lieutenant ? Something you can put into a sentence or two that wo n't require my bringing in three other legals to translate ? " I , icutenant Remington , one of the finest lawyers in the United States Navy , knew when to put the engines in reverse . Legal ethics had been violated by misinformation ; the course was clear . Aggressive retreat with Bill boilers  --  or nuclear power , he supposed , although he did not really know . " I 'll personally accelerate the vet-delay , Admiral .

No such order can .... 1 1. i r .. ini ... rlw .. nw nuM-inn .. hii. i . ter c-n .... 1 nrrnlw  | " That will be all , Lieutenant , " said the Admiral , cutting off his subordinate and sitting down . " Yes , sir . " " No , that is n't all ! " continued Hickman , abruptly leaning forward . " How 's that transcript released , and how soon can you expect it ? " " With State 's input it 'll only be a matter of hours , sir , noon or shortly afterwards , I 'd guess . A classified teletype will be sent to those requesting the flag . However , since SAND PAC has only placed a restriction and not a request ? " " Request it , Lieutenant . Bring it up to me the minute it gets here and do n't leave the base until it does . " " Aye , aye , sir ! " The deep-red Mercedes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Erich Leifhelm 's estate . The late-afternoon orange sun filtered diagonally through the tall trees , which not only bordered the road but were everywhere beyond on both sides . The drive might have been restful had it not been for a sight that made the whole scene grotesque : racing alongside the car were at least a half-dozen giant Dobermans , not one of them making a sound . There was something unearthly about their running furiously in silence , black eyes flashing up at the windows , their jaws wide with rapid , erratic breathing , teeth bared , but no sound emerging from their throats . Somehow Converse knew that if he stepped out of the car without the proper commands being issued , the powerful dogs would tear him to pieces . The limousine pulled into a long circular drive that fronted wide brown marble steps leading to an arched doorway , the heavy panels covered with dark bas-relief  --  a remnant of some ancient pillaged cathedral . Standing on the lower step was a man with a silver whistle raised to his lips . Again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suddenly the animals abandoned the car and ran to him , flanking him , facing forward on their haunches , jaws slack , bodies pulsating . " Please wait , sir , " said the chauffeur as he climbed out and ran around to Joel 's door . " If you will step out , please , and take two paces away from the car . Only two paces , sir . " The chauffeur now held in his hand a black object with a rounded metal tube extending from the front of the instru ment , not unlike a miniaturized electric charcoal starter . " What 's that ? " asked Converse . " Protection , sir . For you , sir . ' I'hc clogs , sir . They arc trained to sense heavv metal . " jux  --  I stood there as the German moved the electronic detector over his  | clothes , including his shoes , his inner thighs and the back of his waist . " Do you people really think I 'd come out here with a gun ? " " I do not think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " How original , " mumbled Converse as he watched the man on the marble step raise the silver whistle again to his lips . As one , the phalanx of Dobermans suddenly leaped forward . In panic , Joel grabbed the chauffeur , spinning the German in front of him . There was no resistance ; the man simply turned his head and grinned as the dogs veered to the right and raced around the circular drive into the approach road cut out of the forest . " Do n't apologize , mein Herr , " said the chauffeur . " It happens often . " " I was n't going to apologize , " said Converse flatly as he released the man . " I was going to break your neck . " The German moved away , and Joel remained motionless , stunned by his own words . He had not spoken words like that in over eighteen years . " This way , sir , " said the man on the steps , his accent oddly yet distinctly British . Inside , the great hall was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The hall led into an immense sitting room , the motif again medieval , made comfortable by soft leather chairs and couches , gaily fringed lamps and silver services everywhere on thin polished tables . The room was also made ugly by the profusion of protruding animals ' heads on the upper walls ; large cats , elephants and boar looked down in defiant anger . It was a field marshal 's lair . It was not , however , the furnishings that absorbed Converse 's attention but the sight of the four men who stood beside four separate chairs facing him . I le knew Bertholdier and Leifhelm ; they stood beside each other on the right . It was the two on the left he stared at . The medium-sized , stocky man with the fringe of close-cropped hair on a balding head and wearing a rumpled safari jacket , the ever-present boots below his khaki trousers , could be no one but Chaim Abrahms . His pouched , angry face with its slits of glaring eyes was the face of an avenger . The very tall man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair was General Jan van Headmer , the Slayer of Soweto . Joel had read the Van ' I leadmer dossier quickly ; fortunately it was the briefest , the final summary saying it all . In essence , Van Headmer is a Cape Town aristocrat , an Afrikaner who has never really accepted the British , to say nothing Of the tribal blacks . His convictions are rooted in a reality  | that for him is unshakable . His forebears carved out a savage land under savage conditions and at a great loss of life brutally taken by savages . His thinking is unalterably that of the late-nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries . He will not accept the sociological and political inroads made by the more educated Bantus because he will never consider them anything more than bush primitives . When he orders austere deprivations and mass executions , he thinks he is dealing only with subhuman animals . It is this thinking that led him to be jailed along with Prime Minister Verwoerd and the racist Vorster during World War II . He concurred wholeheartedly with the Nazi concept of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the single difference between him and the Nazis , and not a contradiction for him . The sabras carved a land out of a primitive Palestine ; their history parallels his country 's , and both men take pride in their strength and respective accomplishments . Van Headmer , incidentally , is one of the most charming men one could meet . On the surface , he is cultured , extremely courteous and always willing to listen . Underneath , he is an unfeeling killer , and he is Delavane 's key figure in South Africa with its vast resources . " Mein Haus ist dein Haus , " said Leifhelm , walking toward Joel , his hand outstretched . Converse stepped forward to accept the German 's hand . Their hands clasped . " That was an odd greeting outside for such a warm sentiment , " said Joel , abruptly releasing Leifhelm'F hand and turning to Bertholdier . " Good to see you again , General . My apologies for the unfortunate incident in Paris the other night . I do n't mean to speak lightly of a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't think he had much regard for mine . " Joel 's boldness had the desired effect . Bertholdier stared at him , mu mentarily unsure of what to say . And Converse was aware that the other three men were watching him intently , without question struck by his audacity , in both manners and words . " To be sure , monsieur , " said the Frenchman , pointlessly but with composure . " As you know , the man disregarded his orders . " " Really ? I was told he misunderstood them . " " It is the same ! " The sharp , heavily accented voice came from behind Joel turned around . " Is it ? " he asked coldly . " In the field , yes , " said Chaim Abrahms . " Either one is an error , and errors are paid for with lives . The man paid with his . " May I introduce General Abrahms ? " Leifhehn broke in , touching Converse 's elbow and leading hinm to the Israeli .  | " General Abrahms , it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they shook hands . " Like everyone here , I 've admired you tremendously , although perhaps your rhetoric has been excessive at times . " The Israeli 's face reddened as soft laughter filled the large room . Suddenly Van Headmer stepped forward , and Converse 's eyes were drawn to the strong face , the brows frowning , muscles taut . " You are addressing one of my closest associates , sir , " he said ; the rebuke was unmistakable . Then a thin smile creased his gaunt , chiseled face . " And I could not have said it better myself . A pleasure to know you , young man . " The Afrikaner 's hand was stretched toward Joel , who accepted it amid the subdued laughter . " I am insulted ! " cried Abrahms , his thick eyebrows raised , his head bobbing in mock despair . " By talkers I 'm insulted ! Frankly , Mr. Converse , they agree with you because none of them has had a woman in a quarter of a century . They may tell you otherwise  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hire whores to play cards with them or read stories into their old gray ears just to fool their friends ! " The laughter grew louder , and the Israeli , now playing to an audience , went on , leaning forward and pretending to speak sotto voce to Joel . " But you see , I hire t he whores to tell me the truth while I shtup them ! They tell me these fancy talkers nod off by nine o'clock , whining for warm milk . With the Ovaltine , if it 's possible ! " " My dear sabra , " said Leifhelm , talking through his laughter , " you read your own roman fiction too assiduously . " " You see what I mean , Converse ? " asked Abrahms , shrugging , palms extended . " You hear that ? Assiduously . ' Now you know why the Germans lost the war . They forever spoke so dramatically of the Blitzkrieg and the Angri f f e , but actually they were talking  --  assiduously  --  about what to do next ! " " They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Bertholdier , enjoying himself . " You could have changed your name , called Rommel and Von Runstedt Jews and taken over both fronts . " " The High Command could have done worse , " agreed the Israeli . " I wonder , though , " continued the Frenchman , " if you would have stopped there ? Hitler was a fine orator , as you are a fine orator . Perhaps you would have claimed that he , too , was a Jew and moved into the chancellery . " " Oh , I have it on good authority that he was a Jew . But from a very bad family . Even we have them ; of course , they 're all from Europe . " The laughter grew again and then rapidly began to subside . Joel took the cue . " Sometimes I speak too frankly , General , " he said . " I should  | learn better , but , believe me , no insult was intended . I have nothing but admiration for your stated positions , your policies . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Erich Leifhelm , drawing everyone 's attention . " Positions , policies , overall philosophy , if you will . We will stay as far away from specifics as we can , although a few will undoubtedly intrude . However , it is our approach to the larger abstractions that count . Come , Mr. Converse , have a chair . Let us begin our conference , the first of many , I trust . " Rear Admiral Hickman slowly put down the transcript on his desk , and looked aimlessly  --  past his propped-up feet  --  out the window at the ocean under a gray sky . He crossed his arms , lowered his head and frowned . He was as bewildered now as he had been when he first read the transcript , as convinced now as he was then that Remington 's conclusions  --  conclusion , really  --  was off the mark . But then the legal officer was too young to have any real knowledge of the events as they had actually happened ; no one who had not been there could really understand . Too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flag , but it made no sense to apply that reasoning to this Converse eighteen years later . It was exhuming a corpse that had died from a fever , whether the shell of a man lived on or not . It had to be something else . Hickman looked at his watch , unfolded his arms and removed his feet from the edge of the table . It was three-ten in Norfolk ; he reached for the telephone . " Hello , Brian , " said Rear Admiral Scanlon of the Fifth Naval District . " I want you to know how much we appreciate SAND PAC 's help in this thing . " " SAND PAC 's ? " asked Hickman , bemused that no credit was given to the State Department . " All right , Admiral , your help . I owe you one , old Hicky . " " Start paying by dropping that name . " " Hey , come on , do n't you remember the hockey games ? You 'd come racing up the ice and the whole cadet corps would shout : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " May I unblock my ears now ? " " I 'm just trying to thank you , pal . " " That 's just it , I 'm not sure for what ? Have you read the transcript ? " " Naturally . " " What the hell 's there ? " " NA'cll , " answered Scanlon tentatively . " I read it pretty quickly . It 's bccn an awful day and , frankly , I just passed it on . What do you think  | is there ? Between you and me , I 'd like to know , because I barely had time to skim through it . " " What do I think is there ? Absolutely nothing . Oh , sure , we kept flags on stuff like that back then because the White House passed the order to put a lid on officially recorded criticism and we all went along . Also we were pretty sick and tired of it ourselves . But there 's nothing in that transcript that has n't been heard before , or that has any value for anyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very small footnote . " " Well , " said Scanlon , even more tentatively , " this Converse had some pretty harsh things to say about Command-Saigon . " " About Mad Marcus ? Christ , I said worse during the Force-Tonkin conferences and my CO did me ten times better . We ferried in those kids up and down the coast when all they were ready for was a day at the beach with hot dogs and Ferris wheels . . . . I do n't get it . You and my legal zero in on the same thing , and I think it 's old hat and discredited . Mad Marcus is a relic . " " Your who ? " " My legal exec . I told you about him , Remington . " " Oh , yes . The stickler prick . " " He picked up on the Saigon thing too . That 's it , ' he said . It 's in those remarks . It 's Delavane . ' He was n't around to know Delavane was fair game for every antiwar group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name Mad Marcus . No , it 's not Delavane , it 's something else . Perhaps it 's in those escapes , specifically Converse 's last escape . Maybe there 's some MIA input we do n't know about . " " Well , " repeated the admiral in Norfolk for the third time , but now far less tentatively . " You may have something there , but it does n't concern us . Look , I 'll be honest with you . I did n't want to say anything because I did n't want you to think you went to a lot of trouble for nothing , but the word I get is that the whole thing is a bust-negative . " " Oh ? " said Hickman , suddenly listening very carefully . " How so ? " " It 's the wrong man . Apparently an overenthusiastic JG was doing some digging in the same time period , the same general circumstances . I Ic saw the flag and drew six wrong conclusions . I hope he enjoys taking five A.M. muster . " " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , controlling his astonishment . " That 's the feedback we get here . Whatever your CLO had in mind has n't anything to clo with our people . " I Iickman could not believe what he was hearing . Of course Scanlon had not mentioned the State Department 's efforts . He knew nothing about  | them ! He was quickly putting as much distance between himself and the Converse flag as he could , lying because he had not been told . State was working quietly  --  probably through Cons Op  --  and Scanlon had no reason to think " old Hicky " knew a damn thing about Bonn or Converse or Connal Fitzpatrick 's whereabouts . Or about a man named Preston Halliday who had been murdered in Geneva . What was happening ? He would not find out from Scanlon . Nor did he care to . " To hell with it , then . My CLO will be back in three or four days and maybe I 'll learn something . " " Whatever it is , it 's back in your sandbox , Admiral . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't navigate a row boat in the D.C. Reflecting Pool . " " Ca n't blame you for that , Hicky . " Hickman hung up the phone and resumed his standard position when in thought , gazing beyond his propped-up shoes at the ocean . The sun was trying to break through the overcast without much success . He had never liked Scanlon for reasons too petty to examine . Except one ; he knew Scanlon was a bar . What he had not known was that he was such a stupid liar . Lieutenant David Remington was flattered by the call . The well-known four-striper had invited him to lunch  --  not only invited him but had apologized for the lateness of the invitation and told him that it was perfectly understandable if it was inconvenient . Further , the captain wanted him to know that the call was of a personal nature , having nothing to do with naval business . The high-ranking officer , although a resident of La Jolla , was in port for only a few days and needed legal advice . He had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lawyer in the United States Navy . Would the lieutenant accept ? Of course Remington had made it perfectly clear that whatever advice he might offer would be offered on the basis of amicus-amicae ; no remuneration could possibly be considered , as that would be a violation of Statute .. . " May I buy you lunch , Lieutenant , or do we have to split the check ? " the four-striper had asked  --  somewhat impatiently , thought Remington . The restaurant was high in the hills above La Jolla , an out-of-the-way roadside inn that apparently catered to diners of the area and those from San Diego and University City who did not care to be seen together in the usual places . Remington had not been too pleased ; he would have preferred being seen at the Coronado with the captain than traveling ten  | lilies north so as not to be seen in the hills of La Jolla . Nevertheless , the four-striper had been politely adamant ; it was where he wanted to meet . David had checked him out . The much decorated captain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a potential candidate for the Joint Chiefs of Staff . Remington would have ridden a bicycle on the exposed Alaskan pipeline to keep the appointment . Which was exactly what he thought he was doing , as he spun the steering wheel right , then left , then right and right again as he made his way up the steep narrow roads . It was important to keep in mind , he thought , as he whipped the car to the left , that personal advice was nevertheless professional advice , and without payment of any sort whatsoever , it constituted a debt that would one day be acknowledged . And if a man was elevated to the Joint Chiefs ... Remington could not help it : in a glow of self-importance he had let drop to a fellow legal officer  --  the one who had coined the name " stickler prick " ? that he was lunching with NI ! a highly regarded four-striper in La Jolla and might be late returning to the office . Then to drive his point home , he had asked his associate for directions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What was it ? Oh , my God ! At the apex of the hairpin curve was an enormous black rig , thirty feet in length , and out of control . It weaved right and left on the narrow incline , its speed gathering with every foot , measured in racing yards , a II . black behemoth swerving , crashing down on everything in front of it , a wild beast gone mad ! Remington whipped his head to his right as he spun the wheel to avoid impact . There were only thin trunks of young trees and saplings in latesummer bloom ; below was a floral abyss . These were the last images he saw as the car careened on its side and began the plunge . l " ar above on another hill a man kneeled , binoculars raised to his face as the explosion below confirmed the kill . His expression was one of neither joy nor sadness , merely acceptance . A mission had been accomplished . After all , it was war . And Lieutenant David Remington , whose life was so ordered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and how in this world , who knew above all that he would never be trapped by the forces that had killed his father in the name of corporate policy , was put to death by the policy of a company he had never heard of . An enterprise called Aquitaine . He had seen the name Delavane . ! Their view is that it ? s the proper evolution of current history , all other ideologies having failed .... The words spoken by Preston Halliday in  | Geneva kept repeating themselves in Converse 's inner ear as he listened to the four voices of Aquitaine . The frightening thing was that they believed what they said without equivocation , morally and intellectually , their convictions rooted in observations going back decades , their arguments persuasive as they illuminated past global mistakes of judgment that resulted in horrible suffering and unnecessary loss of life . The simple objective of their coming together  --  allies and former enemies alike  --  was to bring benevolent order to a world in chaos , to permit the industrial states to flourish for the good of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trade to the impoverished , uncommitted Third World and , by so doing , secure its commitment . Only in this way , in this coming together , could Communism be stopped ? stopped and reversed until it collapsed under the sheer force of superior armed might and financial resources . To bring all this about required a shift in values and priorities . Industrial decisions everywhere must be coordinated to bring about the total strength of the free states . Government treasuries , multinational corporations and giant conglomerates must look to a stratum of interlocking committees , agree to be directed by these committees , to accept their decisions  --  which would in effect be their respective governments ' decisions  --  each keeping the others apprised of its current agenda . What was this ultimate stratum of negotiators ? Who would be the members of these committees that would in effect speak for the free nations and set their policies ? Throughout history only one class of people remained constant in its excellence , who when called upon in times of crisis performed far beyond human expectations  --  even in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in war  --  and even in peace , though to a lesser degree ? were historically clear : these men were selfless . They belonged to a class trained to serve without thought of reward except for the recognition of excellence . Wealth was irrelevant because their needs were furnished and perquisites granted only through the outstanding performance of duty . In the new order this class of people would not be subject to the corruptions of the marketplace . In reality it was unusually well equipped to deal with such corruptions , for it could not be touched by them . The mere presence of any illegally gained wealth within its ranks would instantly be recognized and condemned , resulting in courts-martial . This class of society , this novel brand ) of the lniinaii race , was not only incor ri ) ptiblc at the highest levels , it would he the ultimate savior of mankind as we know It tixlay It was the military The world over , even encompassing one 's enemies .  | Together  --  even as enemies  --  they best understood the catastrophic results of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perforce have to be withheld from the body politic , but these were small sacrifices for survival . Who could argue ? None of the four spokesmen for Aquitaine raised his voice . They were the quiet prophets of reason , each with his own history , his own identity ? allies and enemies together in a world gone mad . Converse responded in the affirmative to everything that was said  --  this was not difficult to do  --  and asked abstract questions of philosophy , as he was expected to do . Even the court jester , Chaim Abrahms , became deeply serious and answered Converse 's questions quietly . At one point Abrahms said , " You think we Jews are the only ones in the Diaspora , my friend ? You are wrong . The whole human race is dispersed everywhere , all of us locking rams ' horns and not knowing where to go . Certain rabbis claim we Jews shall not see salvation until the Messianic era , the time of divine redemption when a god will appear to show us the way to our own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we could not wait for Him any longer . We created Israel . Do you see the lesson ? We  --  we here  --  are now the divine intervention on earth . And I ? even I , a man of accomplishment and ego  --  will give up my life in silence so we may succeed . " Jacques-Louis Bertholdier : " You must understand , Mr. Converse , that Voltaire said it best in his Discours sur 1'homme . Essentially he wrote that man attained his highest freedom only when he understood the parameters of his behavior . We will establish those parameters . Is anything more logical ? " Erich Leifhelm : " Goethe said it perhaps better when he insisted that the romance of politics was best used to numb and quell the fears of the uninformed . In his definitive Aus meinem Leben he states clearly that all governing classes must be imbued above all with discipline . Where is it more prevalent ? " Jan van Headmer : " My own country , sir , is the living embodiment of the lesson . We took the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ productive nation . The beast returns and my nation is in turmoil . " And so it went for several hours . Quiet dissertations delivered thoughtfully , reflectively , passions apparent only in the deep sincerity of their convictions . Twice Joel was pressed to reveal the name of his client and twice lie demurred , stating the legal position of confidentiality  --  which could change in ; I matter of days , perhaps less . " I 'd have to offer my client umicthing concrete . An approach , a strat-  | egy that would warrant his immediate involvement , his commitment , if you will . " " Why is that necessary at this juncture ? " asked Bertholdier . " You 've heard our reasoning . Certainly an approach can be discerned . " " All right , scratch approach . A strategy , then . Not the why but the how . " " You ask for a plan ? " said Abrahms . " On what basis ? " " Because you 'll be asking for an investment surpassing anything in your experience . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He has extraordinary resources , " replied Converse . " Very well , " said Leifhelm , glancing at each of his associates before he continued . Joel understood ; permission was being sought based on prior discussions . It was granted . " What would you say to the compromising of certain powerful individuals in specific governments ? " " Blackmail ? " asked Joel . " Extortion ? It would n't work . There are too many checks and balances . A man 's threatened , the threat 's discovered and he 's out anyway . Then the purification rites set in , and where there was once weakness , suddenly there 's a great deal of strength . " " That 's an extremely narrow interpretation , " said Bertholdier . " You do not take into consideration the time element ! " cried Abrahiiis defiantly , for the first time raising his voice . " Accumulation , Converse ! Rapid acceleration ! " Suddenly Joel was aware that the three other men were looking at the Israeli , but not simply watching him . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It 's merely a point . " " Well taken , " said Converse , without emphasis . " I 'm not even sure it applies , " added the Israeli , compounding his error " Well , I 'm sure it 's time for dinner , " said Leifhelm , removing leis hand from the side of his chair . " I 've boasted so much about my table to our guest that I admit to a shortness of breath  --  concern , of course I trust the chef has upheld my honor . " As if answering a signal  --  which Joel knew was the case  --  the British manservant appeared beneath an archway at the far end of the room . " I am clairvoyant ! " Leifhelm rose " Come , come , my friends . Saddle of lamb a citron , a dish created by the gods for themselves and stolen by the irrepressible thief who rules my kitchen . " The dinner was indeed superb , each dish the result of an isolated eflcnt to achieve perfection in both taste and presentation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been forced on him iii expensive restaurant% where his mind was oicly mildly distracted by the food , but hr  | nstinctively knew when a dish was the best in its class . There was nothing cond-rate about Leifhelm 's table , including the table itself , an enormous lid mass of mahogany supported by two huge but delicately carved ipods resting on the intricate parquet floor . The deep-red velour walls the high-ceilinged room were hung with oils of hunting scenes . The low ndelabra in front of the silver-mirrored place mats did not obstruct a est 's view of the person opposite , a feat Joel wished could be mastered ISIII most of the hostesses in New York , London and Geneva . The talk veered away from the serious topics explored in the sitting nn . It was as if a recess had been called , a diversion to ease the burdens statesmanship . If that was the aim , it was eminently successful , and it s the Afrikaner , Van Headmer , who led the way . In his soft-spoken , harming way ( the dossier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harming ) he described a safari he had taken Chaim Abrahms on in the ckl . " I ) o you realize , gentlemen , that I bought this poor Hebrew his first ckct at Safarics ' in Johannesburg and there 's never been a day when I vc n't regretted it . Ifsbecome our great general 's trademark ! Of course , u know why he wears it . It absorbs perspiration and requires very little asking , simply large applications of bay rum . This is a different jacket , n't it , great general ? " " Bleach , bleach , I tell my wife ! " replied the sabra , grimacing . " It takes It the smell of the godless slave traders ! " " ' Talking of slaves , let me tell you , " said the Afrikaner , warming to his ory with a glass of wine , changed with each new course . The story of Chaim Abrahms ' first and only safari was worthy of good vaudeville . Apparently the Israeli had been stalking a male lion for hours it h his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realizing the black understood and spoke English as well as he . Abrahms had zeroed in each l ' of his four rifles prior to the hunt , but whenever he had the lion in his rights , he missed . This supposedly superb marksman , this celebrated gennul with the rifle-eye of a hawk , could not hit eight feet of flesh a hundred tools away . At the end of the day an exhausted Chaim Abrahms , using token English and a multiplicity of hand gestures , bribed the gun bearer lot to tell the rest of the safari of his misses . The hunter and the Bantu returned to camp , the hunter lamenting the nonexistence of cats and the stupidity of gun bearers . The native went to Van Headmer 's tent , and as c Afrikaner told it in perfectly-mimicked Anglicized Bantu , said the limirlg : " I liked the lion more than the Jew , sir . I altered his sights , sir , but apparently I will he forgiven my indiscretion , sir . Among other enticepleats , lie has offered to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Abrahms , to his credit , loudest of all . Obviously , he had heard the story before and relished the telling . It occurred to Joel that only the most secure could listen to such telling tales about themselves and respond with genuine laughter . The Israeli was a rock in the firmament of his convictions and could easily tolerate a laugh on himself . That , too , was frightening . The British servant intruded , walking silently on the hard wood floor and spoke into Erich Leifhelm 's ear . " Forgive me , please , " said the German , rising to take the call . " A nervous broker in Munich who consistently picks up rumors from Riyadh . A sheik goes to the toilet and he hears thunder from the east . " The ebullient conversation went on without a break in the flow , the three men of Aquitaine behaving like old comrades sincerely trying to make a stranger feel welcome . This , too , was frightening . Where were the fanatics who wanted to destroy governments , ruthlessly grabbing control and shackling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the military state ? These were men of intellect . They spoke of Voltaire and Goethe , and had compassion for suffering and pain and unnecessary loss of life . They had humor and could even laugh at themselves while speaking calmly of sacrificing their own lives for the betterment of a world gone mad . But Joel understood their true nature . These were interlopers assuming the mantels of statesmen . What had Leifhelm said , quoting Goethe ? " The romance of politics was best used to numb and quell the fears of the uninformed . " Frightening . Leifhelm returned , followed by the British servant carrying two open bottles of wine . If the call from Munich had brought unfavorable news , the German gave no indication of it . His spirits were as before , his waxen smile at the ready and his enthusiasm for the next course unbridled . " And now , my friends , the lamb a citron  --  medallions of ambrosia and , hyperbole aside , actually rather good . Also , in honor of our guest we have a bonus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Siegburg the other day and ran across several bottles of Beerenauslese , ' 7 1 . What could be a more fitting tribute ? " The men of Aquitaine glanced at one another , then Bertholdier spoke . " Certainly a find , Erich . It 's one of the more acceptable German varieties . " " ' Hie ' 82 Klausherg Riesling in Johannesburg promises to be among the finest in years , " said Vail Headiner . " I doubt it will rival the Richon-le-'Lion Carmel , " added the Israeli . You are all impossible "  | A behatted chef rolled in a silver service cart , uncovered the saddle of Limb and , under appreciative looks , proceeded to carve and serve . The Englishman presented the various side dishes to each diner , then poured the wine . Erich Leifhelm raised his glass , the flickering light of the candles reflecting off the carved crystal and the edges of the silver-mirrored place ats . " To our guest and his unknown client , both of whom we trust will 1 ' ! IIF n be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drank . He took the glass from his lips , and was suddenly aware that the four en of Aquitaine were staring at him , their own glasses still on the table . one had drunk the wine . Leifhelm spoke again , his voice nasal , cold , a fury held in check by an tellect in control . " General Delavane was the enemy , our enemy ! Men ke that ca n't be allowed anymore , ca n't you understand ! ' Those were the rds , were they not , Mr. Converse ? " " What ? " Joel heard his voice but was not sure it was his . The flames f the candles suddenly erupted ; fire filled his eyes and the burning in his hroat became an unbearable pain . He grabbed his neck as he struggled ut of the chair , hurling it back ; he heard the crash , but only as a cccssion of echoes . He was falling . The pain surged into his stomach ; was intolerable ; he clutched his groin , frantically trying to suppress the in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and somehow knew he was writhing wildly on the floor while being held in check by powerful arms . ? Me gun . Step back . Hold him . " The voice , too , was a series of echoes , tough sharply enunciated in a searing British accent . " Now . Fire ! "  | The telephone rang , jolting Connal Fitzpatrick out of a deep sleep . Ile had fallen back on the couch , the Van Headmer dossier in his hand , both feet still planted on the floor . Shaking his head and rapidly blinking and widening his eyes , he tried to orient himself . Where was he ? What time was it ? The phone rang again , now a prolonged , shattering sound . Ile lurched off the couch , his breathing erratic , his exhaustion too complete to shake off in a few seconds . He had not really slept since California ; his body and mind could barely function . He grabbed the phone , nearly dropping it as he momentarily lost his balance . " Yes . . . hello @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said a male voice in a clipped British accent . " This is he . " " Philip Dunstone here , Commander . I 'm calling for Mr. Converse . I le wanted me to tell you that the conference is going extremely well , far better than he thought possible . " " You 're who ? " " Iunstone . Major Philip Dunstone . I 'm senior aide to General Berke . Icy-Greene. " " 13crkcicy-Grccnc ? " " Yrs . Commander . Mr Converse said to tell you that along with th  | others he 's decided to accept General Leifhelm 's hospitality for the night . I fell be in touch with you first thing in the morning . " " Let me talk to him . Now . " " I 'm afraid that 's not possible . They 've all gone out on the motor launch for a spin downriver . Frankly , they 're a secretive lot , are n't they ? Actually , I 'm not permitted to attend their discussions any more than you arc . " " I 'm not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Commander , I 'm simply relaying a message . . . . Oh yes , Mr. Converse did mention that if you were concerned I should also tell you that if the admiral called , you were to thank him and give him his regards . " Fitzpatrick stared at the wall . Converse would not bring up the Hickman business unless he was sending a message . The request made no sense to anyone but the two of then . Everything was all right . Also there could be several reasons why Joel did not care to talk directly on the phone . Among them , thought Connal resentfully , was probably the fact that he did n't trust his " aide " to say the proper words in the event their conversation was being overheard . " All right , Major . . . what was the name again ? Dunstone ? " " That 's right , Philip Dunstone . Senior aide to General BerkeleyGreene . " " Leave word for Mr. Converse that I 'll expect to hear from him by right o'clock . " " Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's nearly two A.M. now . The breakfast buffet usually starts about nine-thirty out here . " " Nine o'clock , then , " said Fitzpatrick firmly . " I 'll tell him myself , Commander . Oh , one final thing . Mr. Converse asked me to apologize for his not having reached you by midnight . They 've really been at it hammer and tongs in there . " That was it , thought Connal . Everything was under control . Joel certainly would not have made that remark otherwise . " Thanks , Major , and by the way , I 'm sorry I was rude . I was asleep and tried to get it together too fast . " " Lucky chap . You can head back to the pillows while I stand watch . Next time you can take my place . " " If the food 's good , you 're on . " " It 's not , really . A lot of pansy cooking , to tell you the truth . Good light , Commander . " " G(x)d night , Major . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked over at the couch ,  | thinking briefly of going back to the dossiers but decided against it . He felt hollow all over , hollow legs , hollow chest , a hollow ache in his head . He needed sleep badly . He gathered up the papers and took them into Converse 's room . He placed them in the attache case , locked it and turned the combination tumblers . Carrying the case , he went back into the sitting room , checked the door , turned off the lights and headed for his own bedroom . He threw the case on the bed and removed his shoes , then his trousers , but that was as far as he got . He collapsed on the pillows , somehow managing to wrap part of the bedspread around him . The darkness was welcome . " That was hardly necessary , " said Erich Leifhelm to the Englishman , as the latter replaced the phone . " Pansy cooking ' is not the way I would describe my table . " " He undoubtedly would , " said the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's check the patient . " The two walked out of the library and down the hall to a bedroom . Inside were the three other men of Aquitaine along with a fourth , his black bag and the exposed hypodermic needles denoting a physician . On the bed was Joel Converse , his eyes wide and glasslike , saliva oozing from the sides of his mouth , his head moving back and forth as if in a trance , unintelligible sounds emerging from his lips . The doctor glanced up and spoke . " There 's nothing more he can give us because there is nothing more , " said the physician . " The chemicals do n't lie . Quite simply , he 's a blind sent out by men in Washington , but he has no idea who they are . He did n't even know they existed until this naval officer convinced him they had to exist . His only referrals were Anstett and Beale . " " Both dead , " interrupted Van Headmer . " Anstett is public , and I can vouch for Beale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kill . There can be no trace , incidentally . The Greek is back on the chalk cliffs selling laces and inflated whisky in his taverna . " " Prepare him for his odyssey , " said Chaim Abrahms , looking down at Converse . " As our specialist in the Mossad put it so clearly , distance is now the necessary requirement . A vast separation between this American and those who would send him out . " Fitzpatrick stirred as the bright morning sunlight from the windows Ine re e ? ( I the darkness and expanding shades of white forced his eyelids open I he stre tched , his shoulder digging into a hard corner of the attache case . the rest of Imn conxtru led hV the bedspread , which was- tangled . t r t ... Iru. 111 Lu kr.t it ot ! .111 ( 1 tlnne ' his arms on both sides of the  | bed , breathing deeply , feeling the relaxed swelling of his chest . He swung his left hand above his head , twisted his wrist and looked at his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seven and a half hours , but the uninterrupted sleep seemed much longer . He got out of bed and took several steps ; his balance was steady , his mind clearing . He looked at his watch again , remembering . The major named Dunstone had said breakfast at Leifhelm 's estate was served from nine-thirty on , and if the conference had moved to a boat on  --  the river at 2:00 A.M. Converse probably would not call before ten o'clock . Connal walked into the bathroom ; there was a phone on the wall by the toilet if he was wrong about the call . A shave followed by a hot and cold shower and he would be fully himself again . Eighteen minutes later Fitzpatrick walked back into the bedroom , a towel around his waist , his skin still smarting from the harsh sprays of water . He crossed to his open suitcase on a luggage rack and took out his miniaturized radio , placed it on the bureau and , deciding against the Armed Forces band , dialed in what was left of a German @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the industrial south , as well as charges and countercharges hurled around the Bundestag , but nothing earthshaking . He selected comfortable clothes  --  lightweight slacks , a blue oxford shirt and his cord jacket . He got dressed and walked out into the sitting room toward the phone ; he would call room service for a small breakfast and a great deal of coffee . He stopped . Something was wrong . What was it ? The pillows on the couch were still rumpled , a glass half filled with stale whisky still on the coffee table , as were pencils and a blank telephone message pad . The balcony doors were closed , the curtains drawn , and across the room the silver ice bucket remained in the center of the silver tray on the antique hunt table . Everything was as he had last seen it , yet there was something . ... The door ! The door to Converse 's bedroom was shut . Had he closed it ? No , he had not ! He walked rapidly over and opened the door . He studied the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breathing . It was immaculate ? cleaned and smoothed to a fare-thee-well . The suitcase was gone ; the few articles Converse had left on the bureau were no longer there . Connal rushed to the closet and yanked it open . It was empty . He went into the bathroom ; it was spotless , new soap in the receptacles , the glasses wrapped in clinging paper ready for incoming guests . He walked out of the bathroom stunned . There was not the slightest sign that anyone except a maid had been iii t hat bedroom for days . He ran out to the sitting room and the telephone . Seconds later the  | yesterday . " Yes , indeed , your businessman was even more eccentric than you described , Commander . He checked out at three-thirty this morning , paying all the bills , incidentally . " " He was here ? " " Of course . " " You saw him ? " " Not personally . I do n't come on duty until eight o'clock . He spoke with the night manager and settled your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could your man know it was him ? He never saw him before ! " " Really , Commander , he identified himself as your associate and paid the bill . He also had his key ; he left it at the desk . " Fitzpatrick paused , astonished , then spoke harshly . " The room was cleaned ! Was that also done at three-thirty this morning ? " " No , mein Herr , at seven o'clock . By the first housekeeping shift . " " But not the outer room ? " " The commotion might have disturbed you . Frankly , Commander , that suite must be prepared for an early-afternoon arrival . I 'm sure the staff felt it would not bother you if they got a head start on the task . Obviously , it did not . " " Early afternoon ? I 'm here ! " " And welcome to stay until twelve noon ; the bill has been paid . Your friend has departed and the suite has been reserved . " " And I do n't suppose you have another room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Commander . " Connal slammed down the phone . Really , Commander ... Those same words had been spoken by another over the same telephone at two o'clock in the morning . There were three directories in a wicker rack by the table ; he pulled out the one for Bonn and found the number . " Guten Morgen . Hier bei General Lei ( helm . " " Herrn Major Dunstone , bitte . " " Wer ? " " Dunstone , " he said , then continued in German , " He 's a guest . Philip Dunstone . He 's the senior aide to  --  to a General Berkeley-Greene . They 're English . " " English ? There are no Englishmen here , sir . There 's no one here ? that is to say , there are no guests . " " I lc was there last night ' They both were . I spoke with Major Dunstone " " The general had a small ( limner party for a few friends , but no English pmplr , sir . "  | " Look , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Oh , yes , Mr. Converse . He was here , sir . " " Was ? " " I believe he left . " " Where 's Leifhelm ? " shouted Connal . There was a pause before the German replied coldly , " Who should I say is calling General Leifhelm ? " " Fitzpatrick . Lieutenant Commander Fitzpatrick ! " " I believe he 's in the dining room . If you 'll stay on the telephone . " The line was put on hold ; the suspended silence was unnerving . Finally there was a click and Leifhelm 's voice reverberated over the phone . " Good morning , Commander . Bonn has provided a lovely day , no ? The Seven Mountains are as clear as in a picture postcard . I believe you can see them ? " " Where 's Converse ? " interrupted the Navy lawyer . " I would assume at Das Rektorat . " " He was supposed to be staying at your place . " " No such arrangements were made . They were neither requested nor offered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Commander . My car drove him back . " " That 's not what I was told ! A Major Dunstone called me around two this morning ? " " I believe Mr. Converse left shortly before then .... Who did you say called ? " " Dunstone . A Major Philip Dunstone . He 's English . He said he was the senior aide to General Berkeley-Greene . " " I do n't know this Major Dunstone ; there was no such person here . ! iowever , I 'm familiar with just about every general officer in the British Army and I 've never heard of anyone named Berkeley-Greene . " " Stow it , Leifhelm ! " " I beg your pardon . " " I spoke to Dunstone ! He  --  he said the right words . He said Converse was staying at your place  --  with the others ! " " I think you should have spoken directly with Herr Converse , because there was no Major Dunstone or General Berkeley-Greene at my home last night . Perhaps you should check with the British embassy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bonn . Perhaps you heard the words Incorrectly ; perhaps they met later at a cafe . " " I could n't speak to hint ! Dunstone said you were out on the river in a boat . " Fitzpatrick 's breath was now coming in short gasps . " Now , that 's ridiculous , Conunander . It 's true I keep a small launch  | for guests , but it 's a well-known fact that I am not partial to the water . " The general paused , adding with a short laugh . " The great field marshal gets seasick in a flatboat six feet from shore . " " You 're lying ! " " I resent that , sir . Especially about the water . I never feared the Russian front , only the Black Sea . And if we had invaded England , I assure you I would have crossed the Channel in a plane . " The German was toying with him ; he was enjoying himself . " You know exactly what I mean ! " Connal shouted again . " They said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I say he never came back ! " " And I say this conversation is pointless . If you are truly alarmed , call me back when you can be civil . I have friends in the Staatspolizei . " Again a click ; the German had hung up . As Fitzpatrick replaced the phone another thought suddenly struck him . Frightened , he walked quickly into the bedroom , his eyes instantly zeroing in on the attache case . It was partly under the pillow ; oh God , he had been in such a sound sleep ! He yanked the case out and examined it . Breathing again , he saw that it was the same case , the combination locks secure ; no amount of pressure on the small brass buttons would release the plates . He lifted the case and shook it ; the weight and the sounds were proof that the papers were inside and intact , proof also that Converse had not returned to the inn and checked out . All other considerations aside and regardless of whatever emergencies that might have arisen , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of names . Connal carried the case back into the sitting room trying to collect his thoughts , putting them in alphabetical sequence so as to impose some kind of order . A : He had to assume that the flag on Joel 's service record had been lifted or the damaging information unearthed in some other way and that Converse was now being held by Leifhelm and the contingent from Aquitaine that had flown in from Paris , Tel Aviv and Johannesburg . B : They would not kill him until they had used every means possible to find out what he knew  --  which was far less than they imagined and could take several days . C : The Leifhelm estate , according to his dossier , was a fortress ; thus the chances of going in and bringing Converse out were nil . D : Fitzpatrick knew he could not appeal to the American embassy . To begin with , Walter Peregrine would place him under territory arrest and those doing the arresting alight tut a bullet in his head . One had trial / " IIc ccmld @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which ruler different circumstances might he a logical course of action . Everything nl the atnu-.II 's makeup ruled out any connection with Aqul ? ?  | taine ; he was a fiercely independent officer whose conversations were laced with barbed remarks about the Pentagon 's policies and mentality . But if that flag had been officially released  --  whether with his consent or over his objections  --  Hickman would have no choice but to call him back to the base for a full inquiry . Any contact at all could result in the immediate cancellation of his leave , but if there was no contact and no way to reach him , the order , obviously , could not be given . Connal sat down on the couch , the attache case at his feet , and picked up a pencil ; he wrote out two words on the telephone message pad : Call 1leagen . He would tell his sister to say that after Press 's funeral he had left for parts unknown without explanation . It was consistent with what the had said to the admiral , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investigating Preston Halliday 's death . F : He could go to the Bonn police and tell them the truth . He had every reason to believe that an American colleague was being held against his will inside the gates of General Erich Leifhelm 's estate . Then , of course , the inevitable question would arise : Why did n't the Lieutenant ( ; ommander contact the American embassy ? The unspoken would be just below the surface : General Leifhelm was a prominent figure , and such a serious charge should have diplomatic support . The embassy again . Strike out . Then again , if Leifhelm said he had " friends " in the Staatspolizei , he probably owned key men in the Bonn Police . If he was alarmed , Converse could be moved . Or killed . G : ... was insane , thought the Navy lawyer as a legal phrase crept slowly into his consciousness , suddenly taking on a blurred viability . Trade-off . It was a daily occurrence in pretrial examinations , both civilian and military . We 'll drop this if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this area if you stay out of that one . Standard practice . Trade-off . Was it possible ? Could it even be considered ? It was crazy and it was desperate , but then nothing was sane , nothing held much hope . Since force was out of the question , could an exchange be made ? Leifhelm for Converse . A general for a lieutenant . Connal did not dare analyze ; there were too many negatives . He had to act on instinct because there was nothing else left , nowhere he could turn that did not lead to a blank wall or a bullet . He got up from the couch , went to the table with the telephone and and reached for the directory on the floor . What he had in mind was insane , but he could not think about that . He found the name . Fishbein , use . The illegitimate daughter of 1 lermann Goring . The rendezvous was set : a back table at the Hansa-Keller cafe on the Kaiserplatz , the reservation in the name of Parnell . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pack a conservative civilian suit ; he wore it now as the American attorney , Mr. Parnell , who was fluent in German and sent by his firm in Milwaukee , Wisconsin , to make contact with one use Fishbein in Bonn , West Germany . He also had the presence of mind in Bonn , West Germany , to have managed a single room at the Schlosspark on the Venusbergweg and placed Converse 's attache case where it would be safe for a considerable length of time , a trail left for Converse should everything blow apart . A trail he would recognize  --  if Joel was alive and able to hunt . Connal arrived ten minutes early , not merely to secure the table but to familiarize himself with the surroundings and silently practice his approach . He had done the same thing many times before , walking into military courtrooms before a trial , testing the chairs , the height of the tables , the scan of vision of the tribunal on the dais . It all helped . He knew it was she when the woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lectern . She was tall and heavy , not obese but fleshy in a statuesque way , conscious of her mature sensuality but smart enough not to parade it . She was dressed in a light-gray summer suit , the jacket buttoned above her generous breasts , a wide white collar demurely angled over the fabric . Her face , too , was full but not soft , the high cheekbones lending an appearance of character that might not otherwise have been there ; her hair was dark and shoulder-length , with slight streaks of premature gray . She was escorted to the table by the dining room 's captain . Fitzpatrick rose as she approached . " Guten Tag , Frau Fishbein , " he said , extending his hand . Bitte , setzen Sie Bich . " " It 's not necessary for you to speak German , Herr Parnell , " said the woman , releasing his hand and sliding into the chair under the guidance of the captain , who bowed and left . " I make my living as a translator . " " Whatever you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think under the circumstances I should prefer English , and spoken softly , if you please . Now , what is this incredible thing you alluded to over the telephone , Mr. Parnell ? " " Quite simply an inheritance , Mrs. Fishbein , " replied Fitzpatrick , his expression sincere , his eyes steady . " If a few technical questions can he settled , and I 'm sure they can be , as a rightful legatee you will receive a substantial sum of money . " " From someone in America I never knew ? " " If ( ' knew viuii frith ( ' , " " I did nut , " and Hsu I , ishheiti quickly , her eyes darting about at thr ; ult. , tilt tables " ho ? the ni.ui ' ?  | " He was a member of your father 's staff during the war , " answered Connal , lowering his voice still further . " With your father 's help  --  certain contacts in Holland  --  he got out of Germany before the Nuremberg trials with a great deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way of London , his funds intact , and started a business in the Midwest . It became enormously successful . He died recently , leaving sealed instructions with my firm , his attorneys . " " But why me ? " " A debt . Without your father 's influence and assistance our client would probably have withered for years in jail instead of flourishing as he did in America . As far as anyone was concerned , he was a Dutch immigrant from the Netherlands whose family business was destroyed in the war and who sought his future in America . That future included considerable real estate holdings and a very successful meat-packing plant  --  all in the process of being sold . Your inheritance is in excess of two million American dollars . Would you care for an aperitif , Mrs. Fishbein ? " The woman could not at first reply . Her eyes had grown wide , her full jaw slackened , her stare was trancelike . " I believe I will , Herr Parnell , " she said in a monotone , finding her voice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fitzpatrick signaled the waiter , ordered drinks and tried several times to make idle conversation , commenting on the beautiful weather and asking what sites he should see while in Bonn . It was no use . Ilse Fishbein was as close to being in a catatonic state as Connal could imagine . She had gripped his wrist , clutching it in silence with extremely strong fingers , her lips parted , her eyes two blank glass orbs . The drinks came , the waiter left , and still she would not let go of him . Instead , she drank somewhat awkwardly , lifting the glass with her left hand . " What are these questions to be settled ? Ask anything , demand anything . Do you have a place to stay ? Things are so crowded in Bonn . " " You 're very kind ; yes , I do . Try to understand , Mrs. Fishbein , this is an extremely sensitive matter for my firm . As you can well imagine , it 's not the sort of legal work American attorneys are too happy with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain provisos connecting the successful completion of this aspect of his last will and testament to the full execution of other aspects , we might have ? " " The questions ! What are the questions ? " Fitzpatrick paused before answering , the thoughtful lawyer permitting the interruption but still intent on making his point . " Everything will be handled confidentially , the probate court operating in camera ? " " With photographs ? " " In private , Mrs. Fishbein . For the good of the community , in ex-  | change for specific state and local taxes that might not be paid in the event of confiscation . You see , the higher courts might decide the entire estate is open to question . " " Yes , the questions ! What are they ? " " Really quite simple . I 've prepared certain statements , which you will sign and to which I can swear to your signature . They establish your bloodline . Then there is a short deposition required substantiating the claim . We need only one , but it must be given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preferably a man whose name is recognizable , whom the recent history books or war accounts establish as a working colleague of your natural father . Of course , it would be advantageous to have someone known to the American military in the event the judge decides to call the Pentagon and ask Who is this fellow ? ' " " I know the man ! " whispered Ilse Fishbein . " He was a field marshal , a brilliant General ! " " Who is he ? " asked the Navy lawyer , then instantly shrugging , dispensing with the question of identity as irrelevant . " Never mind . Just tell me why you think he 's the right man , this field marshal . " " He is greatly respected , although not everyone agrees with him . He was one of the grossmdchtigen young commanders , once decorated by my father himself for his brilliance ! " " But would anyone in the American military establishment know him ? " " Mein Gott ! He worked for the Allies in Berlin and Vienna after the war ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Brussels ! " Yes , thought Connal , we 're talking about the same man . " Fine , " said Fitzpatrick casually but seriously . " Do n't bother giving me his name . 1 t does n't matter , and I probably would n't know it anyway . Can you reach him quickly ? " " In minutes ! He 's here in Bonn . " " Splendid . I should catch the plane back to Milwaukee by tomorrow noon . " You will come to his house and he will dictate what you need to his secretary . " " I 'm sorry I ca n't do that The deposition must be countersigned by a notary . I uncicr.stand von have the same rules over here  --  and why not , you invented them and the Schlosspark I Intel has both typing and notary sewn es Say this evening , or perhaps early irr the morning ? I should be more than Happy to vend a taxi for your friend . I do n't want this to  | cost him a pfennig . Any expenses he incurs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giggled  --  a slightly hysterical giggle . " You do not know my friend , mein Herr . " " I 'm sure we 'll get along . Now , how about lunch ? " " I have to go to the toilet , " said the German woman , her eyes glass orbs again . As she rose , Connal rising with her , she whispered , " Mein Gott ! Zwei Millionen Dollar ! " ' He does not even care to know your name ! " cried Ilse Fishbein into the hone . " He 's from a place called Milwaukee , Wisconsin , and is offering me two million dollars American ! " " He did not ask who I was ? " " He said it did n't matter ! He probably would n't know you , in any event . Can you imagine ? He offered to send a taxi for you ! He said you hould not spend a penny ! " " It 's true Goring was excessively generous during the last weeks , " mused Leifhelm . " Of course , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supplied him with narcotics , which were difficult to obtain , were rewarded with the whereabouts of priceless art treasures . The one who later smuggled him the poisoned suppositories still lives like a Roman emperor in Luxembourg . " " So you see , it 's true ! Goring did these things ! " " Rarely knowing what he was doing , however , " agreed the general reluctantly . " This is really most unusual and very inconvenient , Ilse . Did this man show you any documents , any proof of his assignment ? " " Naturally ! " lied Fishbein , close to panic , picking remembered words out of the air . " There was a formal page of legal statements and a .. . deposition  --  all to be handled by the courts confidentially ! In private ! You see , there is a question of taxes , which would not be paid if the estate was con fiscated ? " " I 've heard it all before , Ilse , " Leifhelm broke in wearily . " There are no statutes for so-called war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their hypocritical rules the instant they cost money , and abandon them . " You are always so perceptive , my general , and I have always been so loyal . I 've never refused you a single request whether it was professional to nature or far more intimate . Please . Two million American ! It will take but ten or fifteen minutes ! " " Ycni 've been like a gcxxl niece , I ca n't deny it , Ilse . And there is no way ainyoiie could know about you in other matters .... Very well , this  | evening then . I 'm dining at the Steigenberger at nine o'clock . I 'll stop at the Schlosspark at eight-fifteen or thereabouts . You can buy me a gift with your  --  shall we say  --  ill-conceived new riches . " " I 'll meet you in the lobby . " " My driver will accompany me . " " Ach , bring twenty men ! " " He 's worth twenty-five , " Leifhelm said . Fitzpatrick sat in the chair in the small conference room on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the manual of instructions on his lap . He tried to match what the clerk had told him to the diagrams and instructions , and was satisfied that he knew enough . There were basic similarities to the standard Navy issue Colt .45 , the only handgun he was familiar with , and the technical information was extraneous to his needs . The weapon he had purchased was a Heckler &; Koch PGS auto pistol , about six inches long , its caliber nine millimeters , and with a nine-shell magazine clip . The instructions emphasized such points as " polygonal rifling " and " sliding roller lock functions " ; he let the manual slip to the floor , and practiced removing the clip and slapping it back into place . He could load the weapon , aim it and fire it ; those were all that was necessary and he trusted the last would not be necessary . He glanced at his watch ; it was almost eight o'clock . He shoved the automatic into his belt , reached down for the instructions and stood up , looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the locations he had designated for himself . As he had expected , the Fishbein woman had told him Leifhelm would be accompanied by someone , a " driver " in this case , and it could be assumed the man had other functions . If so , he would have no chance to perform them . The room  --  one of twenty-odd conference rooms in the hotel  --  that he had reserved under the name of a fictitious company was not large , but there were structural arrangements that could be put to advantage . The usual rectangular table was in the center , three chairs on each side and two at the ends , one with a telephone . There were additional chairs against the walls for stenographers and observers  --  all this was normal . However , in the center of the left wall was a doorway that led to a very small room apparently used for private conversations . Inside was another telephone , which when off the hook caused a button on the first telephone on the conference table to light up ; confidentiality had its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small foyer , thus prohibiting those entering from sc , iuning the mom while standing in the corridor . ( ; Donal folded the I let kler &; KiKc1 instructions , put them in his jacket  | pocket , and walked over to the table to survey his set pieces . He had gone to an office-supply store and purchased the appropriate items . On the far end of the table by the telephone  --  which was placed perpendicular to the edge , the buttons in clear view  --  were several file folders next to an open briefcase ( from a distance its dark plastic looked like expensive leather ) . Scattered about were papers , pencils and a yellow legal pad , the top pages looped over . The setting was familiar to anyone who had ever had an appointment with an attorney , said learned counsel having put his astute observations down on paper prior to the conference . Fitzpatrick retraced his steps to the chair , moved it forward several feet , and crossed to the door of the small side room . He had turned on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he went to the one above the telephone and turned it off . He then walked back to the open door and stood between it and the wall , peering through the narrow vertical space broken up by upper and lower hinges . He had a clear view of the foyer 's entrance ; three people would pass into the conference room and he would come out . There was a knock on the hallway door  --  the rapid , impatient tapping of an heiress unable to control herself . He had told the Fishbein woman the location of the room , but nothing else . No name or number , and in her anxiety she had not asked about either . Fitzpatrick went to the telephone table in the small room , lifted the phone out of its cradle and placed it on its side . He returned to his position behind the door , angling himself so as to look through the crack , his body in the shadows . He took the pistol from his belt , held it in front of him and shouted in a friendly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hotel corridor . " Bitte , kommen Sie herein ! Die Ture ist often . Ich telefoniere gerade ! " The sound of the door as it opened preceded use Fishbein as she walked rapidly into the room , her eyes directed at the conference table . She was followed by Erich Leifhelm , who glanced about and then turned slightly , nodding his head . A third man in the uniform of a chauffeur came into view , his hand in the pocket of his black jacket . Connal then heard the second sound he needed to hear . The hallway door was slammed shut . Ile yanked back the small door and quickly stepped around it , the gun extended , aimed directly at the chauffeur . " You ! " he cried in German . " Take your hand out of your pocket ! Slowly ! " The woman gasped , then opened her mouth to scream . Fitzpatrick interrupted harshly . " Be quiet ! As your friend will tell you , I have n't anything to lose . I can kill the three of you and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the police to look for a Mr. Parnell who does n't exist . " The chauffeur , the muscles of his jaw rippling , removed his hand from  | his pocket , his fingers rigid . Leifhelm stared in anger and fear at Connal 's gun , his face no longer ashen but flushed . " You dare ? " " I dare , Field Marshal , " said Fitzpatrick . " Just as you dared forty years ago to rape a young kid and make damned sure that she and her whole family never walked out of the camps . You bet your ass I dare , and if I were you , I would n't give me the slightest cause to be any angrier than I am . " Connal spoke to the woman . " You . Inside that briefcase on the table are eight strands of rope . Start with the driver . Bind his hands and feet ; I 'll tell you how . Now ! Quickly ! " Four minutes later the chauffeur and Leifhelm sat in two conference chairs , their ankles and wrists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Connal checked the ropes , the knots having been tied under his instructions . Everything was secure ; the more one writhed , the tighter the knots would become . He ordered the panicked Fishbein woman into a third chair ; he lashed her hands to the arms and her feet to the legs . Rising , Connal picked up the automatic from the table and approached Leifhelm , who was sitting in the chair next to the lighted telephone . " Now , " he said , the gun pointed at the German 's head . " As soon as I hang up the phone in the other room we 're going to make a call from here . " He walked quickly into the small side room , hung up the telephone , and returned . He sat down next to the bound Leifhelm and took a scrap of paper out of the open briefcase . On it was written the phone number of the general 's estate on the Rhine beyond Bad Godesberg . " What do you think you 'll accomplish ? " asked Leifhelm . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gun pressed against the German 's temple . " You for Converse . " " Mein Gott ! " whispered Ilse Fishbein as the chauffeur writhed , his hands straining against the ropes , which were now biting into his wrists . " You believe anyone will listen to you , much less carry out your orders ? " " They will if they want to see you alive again . You know I 'm right , General . This gun is n't so loud  --  I made sure of that . I can turn on the radio and kill you and be on a plane out of Germany before you 're found This room is reserved for the night with instructions that we 're not to be disturbed for any reason whatsoever . " Connal shifted the weapon to his left hand , picked up the telephone , and dialed the number written on tile scrap of paper . " Gillen lag . llier hei General leifhelm. " " flit someone in authority on this phone , " said the Navy lawyer in Ix rfect German " 1 have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rifhrlw 's head and I 'll kill him right now unless you do as I say . "  | There were muffled shouts over the line as a hand was held against the mouthpiece . In seconds a crisp British accent was speaking slowly , deliberately in English . " Who is this and what do you want ? " " Well , what do you know ? This sounds like Major Philip Dunstonethat was the name , was n't it ? You do n't sound half so friendly as you did last night . " " Do n't do anything rash , Commander . You 'll regret it . " " And do n't you do anything stupid , or Leifhelm will regret it sooner ? that is , until he ca n't regret anything any longer . You 've got one hour to get Converse to the airport and inside the Lufthansa security gate . He has a reservation on the ten o'clock flight to Washington , D.C. , by way of Frankfurt . I 've made arrangements . I 'll be calling a number in a room where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with him . After I do , I 'll leave here and call you on another phone , telling you where your employer is . Just get Converse to that security gate . One hour , Major ! " Fitzpatrick shoved the phone in front of Leifhelm 's face , and pressed the barrel of the gun into the German 's temple . " Do as he says , " said the General , choking on the words . The minutes went by slowly , stretching into a quarter of an hour , then thirty , the silence finally broken by Leifhelm . " So you found her , " he said , gesturing his head at Ilse Fishbein , who trembled as tears streaked down her full cheeks . " Just as we found out about Munich forty years ago , and a hell of a lot of other things . You 're all on your way to that great big war room in the sky , Field Marshal , so do n't worry about whether I 'll go back on my word to your English butler . I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what you really are . People like you give the military everywhere a goddamned rotten name . " There was a slight commotion from the hallway beyond the door . Connal looked up , raising the gun and holding it directly at Leifhelm 's head . " Was ist ? " said the German , shrugging . " Koine Bewegung ! " From the hotel corridor came the strains of a melody sung by several male voices more off key than on . Another conference in one of the other rooms had broken up , obviously as much from the excessive intake of alcohol as from the completion of a business agenda . Raucous laughter pierced a refrain as harmony was unsuccessfully attempted . Fitzpatrick relaxed , lowering the automatic ; no one on the outside knew the name or number of the room .  | " You say men like me give your profession  --  which is my profession as well  --  a seriously bad name , " said Leifhelm . " Has it occurred to you , Commander , that we might elevate that profession to one of indispensable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Needs us ? " asked Connal . " We need the world first and not your kind of world . You tried it once and blew it , do n't you remember ? " " That was one nation led by a madman trying to impose his imprimatur over the globe . This is many nations with one class of self-abnegating professionals coming together for the good of all . " " Whose definition ? Yours ? You 're a funny fellow , General . Somehow I question your benevolent tendencies . " " Indiscretions of a deprived youth whose name and rightful opportunities were stolen from him should not be held against the man a halfcentury later . " " Deprived or depraved ? I think you made up for lost time pretty quickly and as brutally as you could . I do n't like your remedies . " " You have no vision . " " Thanks be to Jesus , Mary , and Joseph it 's not yours . " The singing out in the corridor faded briefly , then swelled again , more discordant and louder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old Dachau playboys having a beer bust . " Leifhelm shrugged . Suddenly the door burst open , crashing into the wall as three men raced in , spits filling the air as silenced guns fired , hands jerking back and forth , the surface of the table chewed up , splinters of wood flying everywhere . Fitzpatrick felt the repeated stabs of intense pain in his arm as the automatic was blown out of his grip . He looked down and saw the blood drenching the fabric of his right sleeve . Though in shock he glanced about him . Ilse Fishbein was dead , her bleeding skull shattered by a fusillade of bullets ; the chauffeur was smiling obscenely . The door was closed as if nothing had happened . " Stumpier , " Leifhelm said as one of the invaders cut the ropes around his wrists . " I used that term only yesterday , Commander , but I did not know how right I was . Did you think a single telephone call could not he traced to a single room ? It was all too coincidentally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whore comes into immense riches American riches . I grant you it was entirely possible  --  such bequests air made frequently by sausage-soaked idiots who do n't realize the harm they qwq  | " Why , Commander , " said the general , getting out of the chair , " do I sense the bravado of fear ? Do you think I 'm going to have you killed ? " " You sense it . I wo n't give you any more than that . " " You 're quite wrong . Considering the nature of your military leave , you can be of minor but unique service to us . One more statistic to disrupt a pattern . You 'll be our guest , Commander , but not in Germany proper . You are going on a trip . "  | Converse slowly opened his eyes , a dead , iron weight on his lids and nausea in his throat  --  blurred darkness everywhere  --  and a terrible stinging at his side , on his arm , flesh separated from flesh , stretched and inflamed . Blindly he tried to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i r pain . Somewhere light was creeping around the dark space above him , picking its way through moving obstructions , peering into the shadows Objects slowly came into focus  --  the metal rim of the cot next to his face , two wooden chairs opposite each other at a small table in the distance , a door also in the distance , but farther away and shut . . . then another door , this one open , a white sink with a pair of dull-metal faucets on the left in a far-away cubicle . The light ? It was still moving , now dancing , flickering . Where was it ? He found it : high in the wall on either side of the closed door were two rectangular windows , the short curtains billowing in the breeze . ' 1'lie windows were open , but oddly not open , not clear , the spaces interrupted Joel raised his head , supporting himself on his forearm and squinted , trying to see more clearly . Ile focused on the interruptions behind the swelling curtains thin black metal shafts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I lc was in a cell . Ile fell h.0 k the cot , sw.dlowing repeatedly to lessen the burning in his throat , and moved his arm irr circles trying to lessen the pain of !  | the . . . wound ? Yes , a wound , a gunshot ! The realization jarred his memory ; a dinner party had turned into a battleground filled with hysteria . Blinding lights and sudden jolts of pain had been accompanied by strident voices bombarding him , incessant echoes pounding in his ears as he tried desperately to repel the piercing assaults . Then there had been moments of calm , the drone of a single voice in the mists . Converse closed his eyes , pressing his lids tightly together with all his strength as another realization struck him and disturbed him deeply . That voice in the swirling mists was his voice ; he had been drugged , and he knew he had given up secrets . He had been drugged before , a number of times in the North Vietnamese camps , and as always there was the sickening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and violated , his voice made to perform obscenities against the last vestiges of his will . And , again as always , there was the empty hole in his stomach , a vacuum that ran deep and produced only weakness . He felt starved and probably was . The chemicals usually induced vomiting as the intestines rejected the unnatural substance . It was strange , he reflected , opening his eyes and following the moving shafts of light , but those memories from years ago evoked the same self-protective instincts that had helped him then  --  so many years ago . He could not waste energy ; he had to conserve what strength he had . Regain new strength . Otherwise there was nothing but the numbed outrage and neither his mind nor his body could do anything about it . There was a sound across the room ! Then another and another after that ! The grating sound of sliding metal told him that a bolt was being released ; the sharp sound of a key followed by the twisting of a knob meant that the door in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was , and a blinding burst of sunlight filled the cell . Converse shielded his eyes , peering between his fingers . The blurred , frazzled silhouette of a man stood in the doorframe carrying a flat object . The figure walked in and noel , blinking , saw it was the chauffeur who had electronically searched Inns in the driveway . The uniformed driver crossed to the table and deftly lowered the flat object ; it was a tray , its contents covered by a cloth . It was only then that Converse 's attention was drawn back to the sunlit doorway . Outside , milling about in anxious contempt was the pack of Dobermans , their shining black eyes continually shifting toward the door , their lips curled , teeth bared in unending quiet snarls. " ( : uteri Morgen , nwin //err , " said Leifhelm 's chauffeur , then shifting to English , " Another beautiful day on the northern Rhine , no ? "  | " It 's bright out there , if that 's what you mean , " replied Joel , his hand still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grateful to be able to notice after last night . " " Last night ? " The German paused , then added quietly , " It was two nights ago , Amerikaner . You 've been here for the past thirty-three hours . " " Thirty ? " Converse pushed himself up and swung his legs over the side of the cot . Instantly he was overcome by dizziness  --  too much strength had been drained . Oh Christ ! Don ' t waste movement . They 'll be back . The bastards ! " You bastards , " he said out loud but without any real emotion . Then for the first time he realized he was shirtless , and noticed the bandage on his left arm between his elbow and his shoulder . It covered the gunshot wound . " Did somebody miss my head ? " he asked . " I 'm told you inflicted the injury yourself . You tried to kill General Leifhelm but shot yourself when the others were taking your gun away . " " I tried to kill ? With my nonexistent gun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " You were too clever for me , mein Herr . " " What happens now ? " " Now ? Now you eat . I have instructions from the doctor . You begin with the Hafergrutze  --  how do you say ? ? the porridge . " " Hot mush or cereal , " said Joel . " With skimmed or powdered milk Then some kind of soft-boiled eggs taken with pills . And if it all goes down , a little ground meat , and if that stays down , a few spoonfuls of crushed turnips or potatoes or squash . Whatever 's available . " " How do you know this ? " asked the uniformed man , genuinely surprised . " It 's a basic diet , " said Converse cynically . " Variations with the tern . tory and the supplies . I once had some comparatively good meals . . You 're planning to put me under again . " The German shrugged . " I do what I 'm told . I bring you food . I ! ere , let me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approached the cot . " Under other circumstances I 'd spit in your goddamned face . But if I did I would n't have that slight , slight possibility of spitting in it some other time . You may help me . Be careful of my arm . " " You are a very strange man , mein Herr . " " And you 're all perfectly normal citizens catching the early train to I.archInont so you can put down ten martinis before going to the Ii meeting . " " War rat ? I know of no such meeting . " " They 're keeping it secret ; they do n't want you to know . If I were  | " Mich ? President. ? " " Just help me to the chair , like a good ole Aryan boy , will you ? " " Hah , you are being amusing , ja ? " " Probably not , " said Converse , easing into the wooden chair . " It 's a terrible habit I wish I could break . " He looked up at the bewildered German @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said in utter seriousness . Three more days passed , his only visitor the chauffeur accompanied by the sullen , high-strung pack of Dobermans . His well-searched suitcase was given to him , scissors and a nail file removed from the traveling kit  --  his electric razor intact . It was their way of telling him that his presence had been removed from Bonn , leaving him to painfully speculate about the life or death of Connal Fitzpatrick . Yet there was an inconsistency and , as such , the basis for hope . No allusions were made to his attache case , either with visual evidence  --  the page of a dossier , perhaps  --  or through his brief exchanges with Leifhelm 's driver . The generals of Aquitaine were men of immense egos ; if they had those materials in their possession , they would have let him know it . As to his conversations with the chauffeur , they were limited to questicros on his part and disciplined pleasantries on the German 's part , no answers at all  --  at least , none that made any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on ? When am I going to see someone other than you ? " " There is no one here , sir , except the staff . General Leifhelm is away ? in Essen , I believe . Our instructions are to feed you well and restore your health . " Incommunicado . He was in solitary . But the food was not like that given to prisoners anywhere else . Roasts of beef and lamb , chops , poultry and fresh fish ; vegetables that unquestionably had come directly from a nearby garden . And wine  --  which at first Joel was reluctant to drink , but when he did , even he knew it was superior . On the second day , as much to keep from thinking as from anything else , he had begun to perform mild exercises  --  as he had done so many years ago . By the third day he had actually worked up a sweat during a running-in-place session , a healthy sweat , telling him the drugs had left his body . The wound on his arm was still there , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was not serious . On the fourth day questions and reflections were no longer good enough . Confinement and the maddening frustration of having no answers forced him to turn elsewhere , to the practical , to the most necessary  | had to be made . Whatever plans Delavane and his disciples in Aquitaine had for him , they obviously included parading a drugless man  --  more than likely a dead man with no narcotics in his system . Otherwise they would have killed him at once , disposing of his body in any number of untraceable ways . He had done it before . Could he do it again ? He was not rotting in a rat-infested cell and there was no terrible gunfire in the distant darkness , but it was far more important that he succeed now than it ever was eighteen years ago . And there was an extraordinary irony : eighteen years ago he had wanted to break out and tell whoever would listen to him about a madman in Saigon who sent countless children to their deaths  --  or worse , who left those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest of their lives . Now he had to tell the world about that same madman . He had to get out . He had to tell the world what he knew . Converse stood on the wooden chair , the short curtain pulled back , and peered between the black metal bars outside . His cabin , or cottage , or jailhouse , whatever it was , seemed to have been lowered from above onto a clearing in the forest . There was a wall of tall trees and thick foliage as far as he could see in either direction , a dirt path angling to the right beneath the window . The clearing itself extended no more than twenty feet in front of the structure before the dense greenery began ; he presumed it was the same on all sides  --  as it was from the other window to the left of the door , except that there was no path below , only a short , coarse stubble of brown grass . The two front windows were the only views he had . The rest of this isolated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the bathroom but no other openings . All he could be certain of , since the chauffeur and the dogs and the warm meals were proof he was still within the grounds of Leifhehii 's estate , was that the river could not be far away . He could not see it , but it was there and it gave him hope  --  more than hope , a sense of morbid exhilaration rooted in his memory . Once before , the waters of a river had been his friend , his guide , ultimately the lifeline that had taken him through the worst of his journey . A tributary of the Huong Khe south ( it Duc Tho had rushed him silently at night under bridges and past patrols and the encampments of three battalions . The waters of the Rhine , like the currents of the Huong Khe years ago , would be his way out . The multiple sounds of animal feet pounding the earth preceded the streaking dark coats of the I ) obermans as they raced below the window , instantly stopping and crowding angrily in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way with a breakfast no prisoner in isolation should expect .  | Joel climbed off the chair and quickly carried it back to the table , setting it in place and going to his cot . He sat down , kicked off his shoes , and lay back on the pillow , his legs stretched out over the rumpled blanket . The bolt was slid back , the key inserted and the heavy knob turned ; the oor opened . As he did every time he entered , the German pushed the center of the door with his right hand as he supported the tray with his left . However , this morning he was gripping a bulging object in his right and , the blinding sunlight obscuring it for Converse . The man walked n and , more awkwardly than usual , placed the tray on the table . " I have a pleasant surprise for you , mein Herr . I spoke with General Leifhelm on the telephone last night and he asked about you . I told him u were recovering splendidly and that I had changed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him that you had nothing o read and he was very upset . So an hour ago I drove into Bonn and urchased three days of the International Herald Tribune . " The driver laced the rolled-up newspapers next to the tray on the table . But it was not the issues of the Herald Tribune that Joel stared at . It as the German 's neck and the upper outside pocket of his uniform locket . For looped around that neck and angled over to that pocket was a thin silver chain , with the protruding top of a tubular silver whistle clearly visible against the dark fabric . Converse shifted his eyes to the ) r ; the Dobermans were sitting on their haunches , each breathing noisily and salivating , but , to all intents and purposes , immobile . Converse remembered his arrival at the general 's monumental lair and the strange Englishman who had controlled the dogs with a silver whistle . " ' fell Leifhelm I appreciate the reading material , but I 'd be even more grateful if I could get out of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a plane ticket to the beaches in the south of France , nein ? " " For Christ 's sake , just to take a walk and stretch my legs ! What 's the matter ? Ca n't you and that drooling band of mastiffs handle one unarmed mall getting a little air ? . . . No , you 're probably too frightened to try . " Joel paused , then added in an insulting mock-German accent . " I do vot I am tolt . ' The driver 's smile faded . " The other evening you said you would not apologize but instead break my neck . That was a joke . Do you understand ? A joke I find so amusing I can laugh at it . " " I ley , come on , " said Converse , changing his tone as he swung his legs off the cot and sat up . " You 're ten years younger than I am and twenty times stronger . I felt insulted and reacted stupidly , but if you think I 'd raise a hand against you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sorry . You 've been decent to me and I was stupid again . " u  | " Ja , you were stupid , " said the German without rancor . " But also you were right . I do as I am told . And why not ? It is a privilege to take orders from General Leifhelm . He has been gut to me . " Have you been with him long ? " " Since Brussels . I was a sergeant in the Federal Republic 's border patrols . He heard about my problem and took an interest in my case . I was transferred to the Brabant garrison and made his chauffeur . " " What was your problem ? I 'm a lawyer , you know . " " The charge was that I strangled a man . With my arm . " " Did you ? " " Ja . He was trying to put a knife in my stomach  --  and lower . He said I took advantage of his daughter . I took no advantage ; it was not necessary . She was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the way she walked ? es ist klar ! The father was a pig ! " Joel looked at the man , at the clouded malevolence in his eyes . " I can understand General Leifhelm 's sympathies , " he said . " Now you know why I do as I am told . " " Clearly . " " He is calling for his messages at noon . I shall ask him about your walking . You understand that one word from me and the Dobermans will rip your body from its bones . " " Nice puppies , " said Converse , addressing the pack of dogs outside . Noon came and the privilege was granted- The walk was to take place after lunch when the driver returned to remove the tray . He returned , and after several severe warnings Joel ventured outside , the Dobermans crowd mg around him , black nostrils flared , white teeth glistening , bluish-red tongues flattened out in anticipation . Converse looked around ; for the first time he saw that the small house was made of thick , solid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ path , Joel growing bolder as the dogs lost a degree of interest in him under the harsh admonitions of the German 's commands . They began racing ahead and regrouping in circles , snapping at one another but always whipping their heads hack or across at their master and his prisoner . Converse walked faster . " I used to jog a lot back home , " he lied . " Was ist ? Jog ' ? " " Run . It 's good for the circulation . " " You run now , mein Herr , you will have no circulation . The Doher ? mans will sec to it . " " I 've heard of people getting coronaries from jogging too , " said JOd1 slowing down , hut not reducing the speed with which his eyes darted in all directions . The sun was directly overhead ; it was no help in determine .  | The dirt path was like a marked single line in an intricate network of hidden trails . It was bordered by thick foliage , more often than not roofed y low-hanging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ N ass that might or might not lead to other paths . They reached a fork , e leg to the right curving sharply into a tunnel of greenery . The dogs stinctively raced into it but were stopped by the chauffeur , who shouted Inmands in German . The Dobermans spun around , bouncing off each 1I lk her , and returned to the fork , then raced into the wider path on the left . jlI was an incline and they started up a steep hill , the trees shorter and s full , the bramble bush wilder , coarser , lower to the ground . Wind , ought Converse . A valley wind ; a wind whipping up from a trough , a ng narrow slice in the earth , the kind of wind a pilot of a small plane voided at the first sign of weather . A river . It was there . To his left ; they were traveling east . The Rhine was below , rhaps a mile beyond the lower line of tall trees . He had seen enough . e began breathing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uld have walked for miles . He was back on the banks of the Huong Khe , he dark watery lifeline that would take him away from the Mekong cages rid the cells and the chemicals . He had done it before ; he was going to it again ! 1 " Okay , Field Marshal , " he said to Leifhelm 's driver , looking at the silver whistle in the German 's pocket . " I 'm not in as good shape as I thought I was . This is a mountain ! Do n't you have any flat pastures or ' razing fields ? " " I do as I am told , mein Herr , " replied the man , grinning . " Those are hearer the main house . This is where you must walk . " " ' Phis is where I say thank you and no. thank you . Take me back to my bilk grass shack and I 'll play you a simple tune . " II " I do not understand . " " I 'm bushed and I have n't finished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I really needed the air . " " Sehr gut . You are a pleasant fellow . " " You have no idea , good ole Aryan boy . " Ach , so amusing . Die Aden sind in Israel , nein ? Better than in Cennany . " " Nate Simon would love you . He 'd take your case for nothing just to blow it ? No , he would n't . He 'd probably give you the best defense you ever had . " Converse stood on the wooden chair tinder the window to the left of the door All he had to hear and see was the sound and the sight of the dogs ; 1 , ? , f .1 1 .1 '  | were turned on , the door open ; there was sufficient time to run across the room , flush the toilet , close the door and return to the chair . But he would not be standing on it . Instead , it would be gripped in his hands , laterally . The sun was descending rapidly ; in an hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before as the waters of a river had been his friend . They had to be his friends again . They had to be ! The sounds came first  --  racing paws and nasal explosions  --  then the sight of gleaming dark coats of animal fur rushing in circles in front of the jailhouse . Joel ran to the bathroom , concentrating on the seconds as he waited for the sliding of the bolt . It came ; he flushed the toilet , then closed the bathroom door and raced back to the chair . He raised it and stood in place , his legs and feet locked to the floor . The door was opened several inches  --  only seconds now  --  then the German 's right hand pushed it back . " Herr Converse ? Wo sind . . . ? Ach , die Toilette . " The chauffeur walked in with the tray , and Joel swung the chair with all his strength into the German 's head . The driver arched back off his feet , tray and dishes crashing to the floor . He was stunned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought the heavy chair repeatedly down on the chauffeur 's skull until the man went limp , blood and saliva pouring down his eyes and face . The phalanx of dogs had lurched as one at the suddenly closed door and began to bark maniacally while clawing at the wood . Joel grabbed the silver chain , slipped it over the unconscious German 's head and pulled the silver whistle out of the pocket . There were four tiny holes on the tube ; each meant something . He pulled the remaining chair to the window at the right of the door , climbed up and put the whistle to his lips . He covered the first hole and blew into the mouthpiece . There was no sound , but it had an effect . The Dobermans went mad ! They began to attack the door in suicidal assaults . He removed his finger , placed it over the second hole and blew . The dogs were confused ; they circled around each other , snapping , yelping , snarling , but still they would not take their concentration off the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the whistle with all the breath he had . Suddenly , the dogs stopped all movement , their tapered , close-cropped ears upright , shifting  --  they were waiting for a second signal . He blew again , again with all the breath that was in him . It was the sound they were waiting for , and again , as one , the pack raced to the right beneath the window , txr ( nuliug to some ( ether place where they were meant to be by command . Converse leaned down from the ( hair and knelt by the unconscious  | slid the bolt in place . He ran up the dirt path estimating the distance to II the fork where the right leg was verboten and the left led to the steep hill and the sight of the Rhine below . It was actually no more than two hundred yards away , but the winding curves and the thick bordering foliage made it seem longer . If he remembered accurately  --  and on the F walk back he was like a pilot without instruments relying on sightings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ below the fork . Ile reached it , the same flat area , the same diverging paths up ahead . Ile ran faster . Voices ! Angry , questioning ? Not far away and coming nearer ! He dove into the brush to his right , rolling over the needle-like bushes until he could barely see through the foliage . Two men walked rapidly into his limited view , talking loudly , as if arguing but somehow not with each of her . " Was haben die Hunde ? " H " Die sollten bei Heinrich sein ! " Joel had no idea what they were saying ; he only knew as they passed him that they were heading for the isolated cabin . He also knew that they would not spend much time trying to raise anyone inside before they took more direct methods . And once they did , all the alarms in Leifhelm 's fortress would be activated . Time was measured for him in minutes and he had a great deal of ground to cover . He crept cautiously out of the brush on his hands and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sounding curve . He got up and raced for the fork and the steep hill to the kit . The three guards at the immense iron gate that was the entrance to I , rifhelm 's estate were bewildered . The pack of Dobermans were circling mound impatiently in the out grass , obviously confused . " Why are they here ? " asked one man . " It makes no sense ! " replied a second . " I Icinrich has let them loose , but why ? " said the third . " Nobody tells us anything , " muttered the first guard , shrugging . " If we do n't hear something the next few minutes , we should call . " " I do n't like this ! " shouted the second guard . " I 'm calling right now ! " The first guard walked into the gatehouse and picked up the tole-uhrnrc German . He went rapidly through the driver 's pockets , taking his billfold and all the money he had , as well as his wristwatch  --  and his gun . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ memories it evoked . He tiNl shoved it under his belt and went to the door . Outside , he pulled the heavy door shut , heard the click of the lock and  | Converse ran up the steep hill , his breath short , his lips dry , his heartbeat thundering in his chest . There it was ! The river ! He started running down , gathering speed , the wind whipping his face , stinging him . It was exhilarating . He was back ! He was racing through the sudden , open clearings of another jungle , no fellow prisoners to worry about , only the outrage within himself to prod him , to make him break through the barriers and somehow , somewhere , strike back at those who had stripped him naked and raped an innocence and goddamn it  --  turned him into an animal ! A reasonably pleasant human being had been turned into a half-man with more hatreds than a person should live with . He would get back at them all , all enemies , all animals ! He reached the bottom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trees and intertwining underbrush once more a wall to be penetrated . But he had his bearings ; no matter how dense the woods , he simply had to keep the last rays of the sun on his left , heading due north , and he would reach the river . Rapid explosions made him spin around . Five gunshots followed one upon the other in the distance . It was easy to imagine the target : a circle of wood around the cylinder of a lock in the door of an isolated cabin iii the forest . His jailhouse was being assaulted , entrance gained . The minutes were growing shorter . And then two distinctly different sounds pierced the twilight , interwoven in dissonance . The first was a series of short , staccato bursts of a high-pitched siren . The second , between and under the repeated blasts , was the hysterical yelping of running dogs . The alarms had been set off ; scraps of discarded clothing and slept-on sheets would be pressed onto inflamed nostrils and the Dobermans would come after him , no quarter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human flesh a satisfactory reward . Converse plunged into the wall of green and ran as fast as he could , dodging , crouching , lurching from one side to the other , his arms out stretched , his hands working furiously against the strong , supple impedi ment of the woods . His face and body were repeatedly whipped by slashing branches and obstinate limbs , his feet continually tripped by fallen debris and exposed roots . He stumbled more times than he could count , each time bringing an instant of silence that emphasized the sound of the dogs somewhere between the fork and the hill and the lower forest They were no farther away , perhaps nearer . They were nearer , they had entered the wooxls , All around him were the echoes of their hysteria , punctuated by howling yelps of frustration as one or another or several  | were caught in the tangled ground cover , straining and roaring to be free to join the pursuit . The water ! He could see the water through the trees . Sweat was now rolling down his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scrapes on his neck and chin . His hands were bleeding from the sharp nettles and the coarse bark everywhere . Ile fell , his foot plunging into a hole burrowed by some riverbank animal , his ankle twisted and in pain . He got up , pulling at his leg , freeing his foot , and , limping badly , tried to resume running . The Dobermans were gaining , the yelping and the harsh barking louder and more furious ; they had picked up his direct cut , the trail of undried sweat maddening them , preparing them for the ill . The riverbank ! It was filled with soft mud and floating debris , a webbing of nature 's garbage caught in a cavity , whirling slowly , waiting for a strong current to pull it all away . Joel grabbed the handle of the chauffeur 's gun , not to pull it out but to secure it as he limped down the bank to look for the quickest way into the water . I lc heard nothing until the instant when a massive roar came out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the air over the riverbank directly at him . The monstrous face of the dog was contorted with fury , the eyes on fire , the enormous jaw wide  --  all teeth and a gaping , shining black mouth . Converse fell to his knees as the Doberman whipped past his right shoulder , ripping his shirt with its upper eye teeth and flipping over on its back in the mud . The momentary defeat was more th.m the animal could stand . It writhed furiously , rolling over , snarling , Ilrcir rising on its hind legs , lunged up from the mud for Joel 's groin . The gun was in his hand . Converse fired , blowing off the top of the attack dog 's head ; blood and tissue sprayed the shadows , and the slack , Shilling jaws fell into his crotch . The rest of the pack was now racing toward the bank , accompanied by ear shattering crescendos of animal cries . Joel threw himself into the water and swain as rapidly as he could away from the shoreline ; the weapon was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go . Years ago  --  centuries ago  --  he had desperately needed a weapon , knowing it could be the difference between survival and death , and for five days Now could be had . But on that fifth day he had found one on the banks o/ the /Thong Khe . Ile had floated half underwater past a squad on patrol , , and found the point ten minutes later downriver  --  too far from the scout 's unit to be logical  --  a man perhaps thinking angry thoughts that made him walk faster , or bored with his job and wanting a few moments to be by p 300 himself and out of it all . Whichever , it made no difference to that soldier . Converse had killed him with a rock from the river and had taken his gun . He had fired that gun twice , twice saving his life before he reached an advance unit south of Phu Loc . As he pushed against the shoreline currents of the Rhine , Joel suddenly remembered . This was the fifth day of his imprisonment in Leifhelm 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but no less a prison camp . He had done it ! And on the fifth day a weapon was his ! There were omens wherever one wished to find them ; he did not believe in omens , but for the moment he accepted the possibility . He was in the shadows of the river now , the surrounding mountains blocking the dying sun . He paddled in place and turned . Back on shore , at the cavity in the bank that had been his plank to the water , the dogs were circling in confused anger , snarling , yelping , as several ventured down to sniff their slain leader , each urinating as it did so  --  territory and status were being established . The beams of powerful flashlights suddenly broke through the trees . Converse swam farther out ; he had survived searchlights in the Mekong . He had no fear of them now ; he had been there  --  here  --  and he knew when he had won . He let the outer currents carry him east along the river . Somewhere there would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a telephone . He had to get everything in place and build his brief quickly , but he could do it . Yet the attorney in him told him that a man with a bandaged gunshot wound in soaked clothing and speaking a foreign language in the streets was no match for the disciples of George Marcus Delavane ; they would find him . So it would have to be done another way ? with whatever artifices he could muster . He had to get to a telephone . He had to place an overseas call . He could do it ; he would do it ! The Huong Khe faded ; the Rhine was now his lifeline . Swimming breaststroke , the gun still gripped in his hand , his arm smarting in the water , he saw the lights of a village in the distance .  | Valerie frowned as she listened on the phone in her studio , the spiraling cord outstretched as she reached over and placed a brush in the track of her easel . Her eyes scanned the sunlit dunes outside the glass doors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hearing , words that implied things without saying them . " Larry , what 's wrong with you ? " she interrupted , unable to hold herself in check any longer . " Joel 's not just an employee or a junior partner , he 's your friend ! You sound like you 're trying to build a case against him . What 's that term you all use ? . . . Circumstantial , that 's ft. l le was here , he was there ; someone said this and somebody else said that . " " I 'm trying to understand , Val , " protested Talbot , who had called from his office in New York . " You 've got to try to understand too . There 's a swat deal I ca n't tell you because I 've been instructed by people whose offices I have to respect to say very little or preferably nothing at all . I 'm betiding those instructions because Joel is my friend and I want to help . " " All right , let 's go back , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " I know it 's none of my damned business and I would n't ask it if I did n't think I had to ? " " I 'll accept that , " agreed Val . " Now , what is it ? " " Well , I know you and Joel had your problems , " continued the senior  | partner of Talbot , Brooks and Simon , as though he were referring to an inconsequential spat between children . " But there are problems and there are problems . " " Larry , " interrupted Val again . " There were problems . We 're divorced . That means the problems were serious . " " Was physical abuse one of them ? " asked Talbot quickly in a low voice , the words obviously repugnant to him . Valerie was stunned ; it was a question she would never have expected . " What ? " " You know what I mean . In fits of anger did he strike you ? Cause you bodily harm ? " " You 're not in a courtroom , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I might have welcomed it  --  at least the anger . " " I beg your pardon ? " " Nothing , " said Valerie , recovering from her astonishment . " I do n't know what prompted you to ask , but it could n't be further from the truth . Joel had far more effective ways to deflate my ego than hitting me . Among them , dear Larry , was his dedication to the career of one Joel Converse in Talbot , Brooks and Simon . " " I 'm aware of that , my dear , and I 'm sorry . Those complaints are perennial in the divorce courts and I 'm not sure there 's anything we can do about them  --  not in this day and age , perhaps not ever . But that 's different . I 'm talking about his black moods  --  we knew he had them . " " Do you know any rational person who does n't ? " asked the former Mrs. Converse . " This is n't really the best of all possible worlds , is it ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joel lived through a period of time in a far worse world than most of us will ever know or could imagine . I ca n't believe he emerged from it without a scar or two . " Valerie paused , touched by the older man 's unadorned directness ; it had its basis in concern . " You 're sweet , Larry , and I suspect you 're right ? in fact , I know it . So I think you should tell me more than you have The term ' physical abuse ' is what you lawyers call a leading something orother . It 's not fair because it could also be misleading . Come on , Larry , be fair . He 's not my husband anymore , but we did n't break apart because he chased girls or bashed my head in . I may not want to be married to- . him but I respect him . He 's got his problems and I 've got mine , and now you 're implying his are a lot bigger . What 's happened ? " Talbot was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , again quickly , quiet IV ; once more they were obviously repugnant to him . -1 ' 110 , say he assaulted a mean in Paris without provocation . The man died " " No , that 's impossible I le did n't , Ile coiddn ' I ! " ' That 's what he told tue , but he lied lie told use Ile was in Amsterdam ,  | but he was n't . He said he was going back to Paris to clear things up , but he did n't go . He was in Germany  --  he 's still somewhere in Germany . He as n't left the country and Interpol has a warrant for him ; they 're searchng everywhere . Word reached him to turn himself into the American embassy but he refused . He 's disappeared . " " Oh , my God , you 're all so wrong ! " exploded Valerie . " You do n't know him ! If what you say happened , he was attacked first  --  physically attacked and had no choice but to hit back ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know either man . " " Then he 's not impartial , he 's lying ! Listen to me . I lived with that man r four years and , except for a few trips , all of them in New York City . vc seen him accosted by drunks and street garbage  --  punks he could have ushed through the pavements , and perhaps some of them he should have but I never saw him so much as take a step forward . He 'd simply raise he palms of his hands and walk away . A few times some damn fools would 11 him names and he 'd just stand there and look at them . And let me ell you , Larry , that look was enough to make you feel cold all over . But hat 's all he 'd do , never anything more . " " Val , I want to believe you . I want to believe it was self-defense , but c ran away , he 's disappeared . The embassy can help him , protect him , ut he wo n't come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can happen , but it was always for only a w minutes , usually at night when he 'd wake up . He 'd bolt up , his eyes shut so tight his whole face was a mass of wrinkles . It never lasted long , slid he said it was perfectly natural and not to worry about it  --  he did n't , he said . And I do n't think he really did ; he wanted all that in the past , none of it was ever mentioned . " " Perhaps it should have been , " said Talbot softly . Valerie replied with equal softness , " Touche , Larry . Do n't think I avc n't thought about that these last couple of years . But whatever 's appened he 's acting this way only because he 's afraid  --  or you know it 's quite possible he 's been hurt . Or , oh my God ? " " All the hospitals and registered doctors have been checked , " Talbot broke in . " Well , damn it , there 's got to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now it ! " ' That 's just it , Val . Nothing he 's done is like the man I know . " The ex-Mrs . Converse stiffened . " To use one of Joel 's favorite expressions , " she said apprehensively , " clarification , please ? " " Why not ? " answered " Talbot , the question was directed as much at himself as at her . " Perhaps you can shed some light ; nobody else can . " " What about this man in Paris , the one who died ? " iJ  | " There 's not much to tell ; apparently he was a chauffeur for one of those limousine services . According to the witness , a basement guard in the hotel , Joel approached him , yelled something at him and pushed him out the door . There were sounds of a scuffle and a few minutes later the man was found severely beaten in an alley . " " It 's ridiculous ! What did Joel say ? " " That he walked out the door , saw two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way to his taxi . " " That 's what he 'd have done , " said Val firmly . " The doorman at the George Cinq says it did n't happen . The police say follicles of hair found on the beaten man matched those in Joel 's shower . " " Utterly unbelievable ! " " Let 's say there was provocation we do n't know about , " Talbot went on rapidly . " It does n't explain what happened later , but before I tell you , I want to ask you another question . You 'll understand . " " I do n't understand a single thing ! What is it ? " " During those periods of depression , his dark moods , did Joel ever fantasize ? I mean , did he indulge in what psychiatrists call role-playing ? " " You mean did he assume other personalities , other kinds of behavior ? " " Exactly . " " Absolutely not . " " Oh . " " Oh , what ? Let 's have it , Larry . " " Talking about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in for a jolt , my dear . According to those people who do n't want me to say very much ? . and you 'll have to take my word they know  --  Joel flew into Germany claiming he was involved in an undercover investigation of the embassy in Bonn . " " Perhaps he was ! He was on a leave of absence from T. , B. and S. , was n't he ? " " On an unrelated matter in the private sector , that much we know . There is no investigation  --  undercover or otherwise  --  of the embassy in Bonn . Frankly , the people who reached me were from the State Depart ? ment . " " Oh , my God .. . " Valerie fell silent , but before the lawyer could speak , she whispered , " Geneva . That horrible business in Geneva ! " " If there 's a connection  --  and both Nathan and I considered it first  - -  it 's so buried it ca n't he followed " " It 's there It 's where it .111 started " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's not my husband and he is rational ! " " The scars , Val . There had to be scars . You agreed with me . " " Not the kind you 're talking about . Not killing , and lying and running sway ! That 's not Joel ! That is n't  --  was n't  --  my husband ! " " The mind is a highly complex and delicate instrument . The stresses of the past can leap forward from years ago ? " " Get off it , Larry ! " shouted Valerie . " Save it for a jury , but do n't pin that nonsense on Converse ! " " You 're upset . " " You 're damned right I am ! Because you 're looking for explanations that do n't fit the man ! They fit what you 've been told . By those people u say you have to respect . " " Only in the sense that they 're knowledgeable  --  they have access to t-forrnation we do n't have . Then there 's the overriding fact that they had n't the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Association gave them the address and telephone number of Talbot , " $rooks and Simon . " " And you believed them ? With everything you know about Washingtoes you simply accepted their word ? How many times did Joel come back from a trip to Washington and say the same thing to me ? Larry says they 're lying . They do n't know what to do , so they 're lying . ' " " Valerie , " said the attorney sternly . " This is n't a case of bureaucratic clearance , and after all these years I think I can tell the difference between poineone playing games and a man who 's genuinely angry  --  angry and frightened , I should add . The man who reached me was an Undersecrery of State , Brewster Tolland  --  I had a call-back confirmation  --  and he as n't putting on an act . He was appalled , furious , and , as I say , a very worried man . " " What did you tell him ? " " The truth , of course . Not only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would n't help Joel to do anything else . If he 's ill he needs help , not t'oniplicity . " " Aod you deal with Washington every week . " " Several times a week , and of course it was a consideration . " " I'ue sorry , Larry , that was unfair . " " But realistic , and I meant what I said . It would n't help Joel to lie for hnu You see , I really believe something 's happened . He 's not himself . " ? Vait a minute , " cried Valerie , the obvious striking her . " Maybe it 's not Joel ! " " It 's himn , said Talbot simply . " Why ? Just because people you do n't know in Washington say it is ? "  | " No , Val , " replied the lawyer . " Because I spoke with Rene in Paris before Washington entered the picture . " " Mattilon ? " " Joel went to Paris to ask for Rene 's help . He lied to him just as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lies  --  Mattilon and I agreed on that . 1 t was something he saw in Joel 's eyes , something I heard in his voice . An unhinging , a form of desperation ; Rene saw it and I heard it . He tried to conceal it from both of us but he couldn t . When I last spoke to him , he hung up before we 'd finished talking , in the middle of the sentence , his voice echoing like a zombie 's . " Valerie stared at the harsh , dancing reflections of sunlight off the waters of Cape Ann . " Rene agreed with you ? " she asked , barely above a whisper . " Everything I 've just told you we said to each other . " " Larry , I 'm frightened . " Chaim Abrahms walked into the room , his heavy boots pounding th e floor . " So he did it ! " shouted the Israeli . " The Mossad was right , he 's a hellhound ! " Erich Leifhelm sat behind his desk , the only other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , dogs ! cried the German , slamming his frail hand on the red blotter . " Hoy did he do it ? " I repeat  --  a hellhound  --  that 's what our specialist called him . Th e longer he 's restricted , the angrier he gets . It goes back a long time . So our provocateur starts his odyssey before we planned . Have you been in tout li with the others ? " " I 've called London , " said Leifhelm , breathing deeply . " He 'll rear li Paris , and Bertholdier will have the units flown up from Marseilles , one to Brussels , the other here to Bonn . we ca n't waste an hour . " " You 're looking for him now , of course . " Naturlich ! Every inch of the shoreline for miles in both directions . Every back road and path that leads up from the river and into the city . " " He can elude you ; he 's proven it . " " Where can he go , sabra ? To his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To the Bonn police or the Staatspolizei ? He 'll be put in an armored van and brought back here . He goes nowhere . " I heard that when he left Paris , and I heard it again when he flew into Bonn . Errors were made in both places , both costing a great many hours . I tell you I'ni Inure concerned now than at any moment in three wars and a lifetime of skirmishes . " ' Be reasonable . Chaim , and try to be calm : I lc has no clothes hut wha he wean in the river and the loud , he possesses no identification ,  | " I le has money ! " yelled Abrahms , suddenly remembering . " When he as under the needle , he spoke of a large sum of money promised in ctieva and delivered on Mykonos . " " And where is it ? " asked Leifhelm . " In this desk , that 's where it is. early seventy thousand American dollars . He has n't got a deutsche mark his pocket , or a watch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , soaked ) thing , with no identification , no money , no coherent use of the Ianage , and telling an outlandish tale of imprisonment involving der GenI Leifhelm , would undoubtedly be put in jail as a vagrant or a f chopath or both . In which case , we shall be informed instantly and our ple will bring him to us . And bear in mind , sabra , by ten o'clock - orrow morning it wo n't make any difference . That was your contribu-n , the Mossad 's ingenuity . We simply had the resources to make it me to pass  --  as is said in the Old Testament . " ' . Abrahms stood in front of the enormous desk , arms akimbo above the 9i. - ckets of his safari jacket . " So the Jew and the field marshal set it all motion . Ironical , is n't it , Nazi ? " " Not as much as you think , Jude . Impurity , as with beauty , is in the e of the frightened beholder . You are not my enemy ; you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days had your commitment , your audacity , we q ever would have lost the war . " " I know that , " said the sabra . " I watched and listened when you reached the English Channel . You lost it then . You were weak . " IJ " 1 t was not us ! It was the frightened Debutanten in Berlin ! " " Then keep them away when we create a truly new order , German . We n't afford weakness . " " You do try me , Chaim . " " I mean to . " -e chauffeur felt the bandages on his face , the swelling around his eyes id his lips painful to the touch . He was in his own room , where the w tor had turned on the television  --  probably as an insult , as he could barely see it . i Ic was disgraced . The prisoner had escaped in spite of his own formidable talents and the supposedly impassable pack of Dobermans . The American had used the silver whistle , that much the other guards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been removed from his neck was a further embarrassment . I lc would not add to his disgrace . With blurred vision he had gone fhu+nugli his pockets- which no one in the panic of the chase had thought to do and found that ins billfold , his expensive Swiss watch , and all his  | embarrassed enough , and any such revelations might be cause for dismissal  --  or conceivably his death . Joel headed for the shoreline as fast as he could , submerging his head underwater whenever the beam of the searchlight swept toward him . The boat was a large motor launch , its bass-toned engines signifying power , its sudden turns and circles evidence of rapid maneuverability . It hugged the overgrown banks , then would sweep out toward the open water at the slightest sign of an object in the river . Converse felt the soft mud below ; he half swam , half trudged toward the darkest spot on the shore , the chauffeur 's gun securely in his belt- . The boat approached , its penetrating beam studying every foot , every moving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took a deep breath and slowly lowered himself under the water , his face angled up toward the surface , his eyes open , his vision a muddy dark blur . The searchlight grew brighter and seemed to hover above him for an eternity ; he inched his way to the left and the beam moved away . He rose to the surface , his lungs bursting , but suddenly realized he could make no sound , he could not fill his chest with gasps of air . For directly above him , less than five feet away loomed the broad stern of the motor launch , bobbing in the water as if idling . The dark figure of a man was peering through very large binoculars at the riverbank . Converse was bewildered ; it was too dark now to see anything even with magnification . Then he remembered , and the memory accounted for the size of the binoculars . The man was focusing through infrared lenses ; they had been used by patrols in Southeast Asia and were often the difference , he had been told , between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , soldiers in the darkness . The boat moved forward , but the idle increased only slightly , entering the slowest of trawling speeds . Again Joel was confused . What had brought Leifhelm 's searching party to this particular spot on the riverfront ? There were several other boats behind and out in the distance , their searchlights sweeping the water , but they kept moving , circling . Why did the huge motor launch concentrate on this stretch of the shore ? Could they have spotted him through infrared binoculars ? If they had , they were proceeding very strangely ; the North Vietnamese had been far swifter ? more aggressive , more effective . Silently , Converse lowered himself beneath the surface and breaststu ) ked nut beyond the boat Seconds later he raised his head above the water , Ills clear , and lie began to understand the odd maneuverings of I.cifhehn 's pattol Beyond the darkest part of the riverbank into which  | he had lurched for concealment were the lights he had seen eight or nine minutes ago , before the launch and its searchlight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lights of a small village , but he was in the wrong part of the world . Instead they were the inside lights of four or five small houses , a river colony with a common dock , summer homes perhaps of those fortunate enough to own waterfront property . If there were houses and a dock , there had to be a drive  --  an open passage up to the road or roads leading into Bonn and the surrounding towns . Leifhelm 's men were combing every inch of the riverbank , cautiously , quietly , the searchlights angled down so as not to alarm the inhabitants or forewarn the fugitive if he had reached the cluster of cottages and was on his way up to the unseen road or roads . A ship 's radio would be activated , its frequency aligned to those in cars roaming above , ready to spring the trap . In some ways it was the Huong Khe again for Joel , the obstacles far less primitive but no less lethal . And then as now there was a time to wait , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make their moves . They made them quickly . The launch slid into the dock , the powerful twin screws quietly churning in reverse , as a man jumped off the bow with a heavy line and looped it around a piling . Three others followed , instantly racing off the short pier up onto the sloping lawn , one heading diagonally to the right , the other two toward the first house . What they were doing was obvious : one man would position himself in the bordering woods of the downhill entrance drive while his colleagues checked the houses , looking for signs of entry . Converse 's arms and legs began to feel like weights , each an anvil he could barely support , much less keep moving , but there was no choice . The beam of the searchlight kept moving up and down the base of the riverbank , its spill illuminating everything in its vicinity . A head surfacing at the wrong moment would be blown out of the water . Huong Khe . Tread water in the reeds . Do it ! Do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thirty minutes , but it seemed more like thirty hours or thirty days suspended in a floating torture rack . I lis arms and legs were now in agony ; sharp pains shot through his body everywhere ; muscles formed cramps that he dispersed by holding his breath and floating in a fetal position , his thumbs pressing relentlessly into t he cores of the knotted muscles . Twice while gasping for air he swallowed water , coughing it out below the surface , his nostrils drowning , and twice found the air again . There were moments when it crossed his inner consciousness that it would he so simple just to drift away . Huong Khe . Do n't do it ! Do n't die !  | Finally through waterlogged eyes he saw the men returning . One , two ... three ? . . . They ran down to the dock , to the man with the rope . No ! The man with the rope had rushed forward ! His eyes were playing tricks ! Only two men had run onto the dock , the first man joining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the piling and released the rope ; the other two jumped on board . The first man once again joined his companions , now on the bow of the launch  --  leaving another on shore , a lone observer somewhere unseen between the riverbank and the road above . Huong Khe . An infantry scout separated from his patrol . The motor launch swung away from the dock and sped within a few feet past Joel , who was buffeted underwater by its wake . Once more the boat veered toward the shoreline and slowed down , its searchlight peering into the dense foliage of the bank , heading west , back toward Leifhelm 's estate . Converse held his head above the surface , his mouth wide open , swallowing all the air he could as he made his way slowly  --  very slowly ? into the mud . He pulled himself up through the wet reeds and branches until he felt dry ground . Huong Khe . He pulled the underbrush over him as best he could , finally covering his upturned face . He would rest until he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , until the muscles of his neck lost their tension  --  it was always the neck ; the neck was the warning signal  --  and then he would consider the man on the dark hill above him . He dozed , until a slapping wave below woke him . He pushed the branches and the leaves away from his face and looked at the chauffeur 's watch on his wrist , squinting at the weak radium dial . He had slept for nearly an hour  --  fitfully , to be sure , the slightest sounds forcing his eyelids briefly open , but he had rested . He rolled his neck back and forth , that moved his arms and legs . Everything still hurt , but the excruciating pairs was gone . And now he faced a man on a hill above him . He tried to examine his thoughts . He was frightened , of course , but his anger would control that terrible fear ; it had done so before , it would do so now . The objective was all that mattered  --  some kind of sanctuary , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and somehow make the most important telephone call in his life . To Larry Talbot and Nathan Simon in New York . Unless he could do these things he was dead  --  as Connal Fitzpatrick was undoubtedly dead . Jesus ! What had they done to him ? A nian with the purity of vengeance purely sought caught in a diseased web called Aquitaine ! It was an unfair world . . . . But he could not think abentt it ; lie had to concentrate on a man on the hill . 1 lc crept on his hands ; 111 ( 1 knees St retch by stretch he crawled through the wtx xis hordcring the dirt wad that wound up the hill from the lawn  | and the riverbank . Whenever a twig crunched or a rock was displaced he stopped , waiting for the moment to dissolve back into the sounds of the forest . He kept telling himself he had the advantage ; he was the unexpected . It helped counteract the fear of the darkness and the knowledge that a physical confrontation was before him . Like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that man above him now had things he needed . The combat could not be avoided , so it was best not to think about it but to simply force himself into a mind-set empty of any feeling , and do it . But do it well , his mind had to understand that , too . There could be no hesitation , no intrusions of conscience  --  and no sound of a gun , only the use of the steel . He saw him , oddly enough , silhouetted in the distant glare of a single streetlamp far above on a road . The man was leaning against the trunk of a tree and facing down , his sweep of vision taking in everything below . As Joel crept up the slope the space between his hands and knees became inches , the stops more frequent , silence more vital . He made his way in an arc above the tree and the man and then started down , like a large cat descending on its prey . He was the predator he had once been long ago , everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was within six feet ; he could hear the man 's breathing . There was a snap beneath him . A branch ! The scout turned , his eyes alive in the glare of light . Converse lunged , the barrel of the gun gripped in his hand . He crashed the steel handle into the German 's temple and then into his throat . The man fell backward , dazed but not unconscious ; he started to scream . Joel sprang for his enemy 's neck and half choked him before bringing the steel handle down with all his strength on the German 's forehead ; instantly there was an eruption of blood and crushed tissue . Silence . No movement . Another scout separated from his patrol had been taken out . And as he had years ago , Converse permitted himself no feeling . It was done , and he had to go on . The man 's dry clothes , including the dark leather jacket , fit reasonably well . Like most small or medium-sized commanders , Leifhelm surrounded himself with tall men , as much to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compatriots . There was also another gun ; Joel struggled with the clip , removed it , and threw it along with the weapon into the woods . The bonus came with the German 's billfold ; it contained a sizable sum of money as well as a frayed , much stamped passport . Apparently , this trusted employee of Leifhelm traveled widely for Aquitaine  --  probably knowing nothing and being very expendable , but always available at the moment of decision . The man 's shoes did not fit ; they were too small . So Converse used his  | drenched clothing to wipe his own , and the German 's dry socks helped to absorb some of the moisture of the leather inside . He covered the man with branches and walked up the hill to the road . He stayed out of sight between the trees as five cars passed by , all sedans , all possibly belonging to Erich Leifhelm . Then he saw a brightyellow Volkswagen come into view , weaving slightly . He stepped out and held up his hands , the gesture of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blond girl in the passenger seat , the driver no more than eighteen or twenty , another young man in back , also blond , who looked as though he might be the girl 's brother . " Was ist los , Opa ? " asked the driver . " I 'm afraid I do n't speak German . Can you speak any English ? " " I speak some English , " said the boy in back , slurring his words . " Better than these two ! All they want to do is get to our place and make love . See ! I do speak English ? " " You certainly do , and very well , indeed . Would you explain to them , please ? Frankly , I 've had a fight with my wife at a party down there ? you know , at those cottages  --  and I want to get back to Bonn . I 'll pay you , of course . " " Ein Streit mit seiner Frau ! Er will nach Bonn . Er wird uns bezahlen . " " Warum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gekostet , " said the driver . " Nicht fuer was du kriegst , du Drecksack ! " cried the girl , laughing . " Get in , mein Herr ! We are your chauffeurs . Just pray he stays on the road , ja ! What hotel are you staying at ? " " Actually , I 'd rather not go back there . I 'm really very angry . I 'd like to teach her a lesson by staying away tonight . Do you think you could find me a room ? I 'll pay you even more , of course . Frankly , I 've been drinking a bit myself . " " Ein betrunkener Tourist ! Er will ein Hotel . Fahren wir ihn ins Rosen-cafe ? " " Dort sind mehr Nutten als der alte knacker scha f f t . " " We are your guides , Amerikaner , " said the young man beside Converse . " We are students from the university who will not only find you a room , but with excellent prospects of getting back at your wife with some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buy us a lager or six , ja ? " " All you want . But I 'd also like to make a telephone call . To the United States  --  it 's business . Will I be able to ? " " Most everyone iii Bonn speaks English . If they do n't at this Rosencafe , 1 , myself , will take care of it . Six lagers , though , remember that ! " ' Twelve , if you like " " Da wird rs ills ! ' issnir vine ( /herschu'cnnnung geben ! "  | I le knew the rate of exchange , and once inside the raucous cafe  --  actually a run-down bar favored by the university crowd  --  he counted the money he had taken from the two Germans . It was roughly five hundred dollars , over three from the man on the hill . The seedy clerk at the registration desk explained in convoluted English that , indeed , the switchboard could place a call to America , but it might take several minutes . Joel left fifty dollars in deutsche marks for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his room  --  such as it was . An hour later the call Came through . " Larry ? " " Joel ? " " Thank God you 're there ! " cried Converse in relief . " You 'll never now how I kept hoping you were n't out of town . Getting a call through om here is a bitch ! " " I 'm here , " said Talbot , his voice suddenly calm and in control . ' Where are you , Joel ? " he asked quietly . " Some poor excuse for a hotel in Bonn . I just got here . I did n't get the acne . " You 're in a hotel in Bonn but you do n't know which one ? " " It does n't matter , Larry ! Get Simon on the line . I want to talk to you th . Quickly . " " Nathan 's in court . He should be back here by four o'clock  --  our time . hat 's about an hour from now . " " Goddamn it ! " " Take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Do n't upset ... ? For Christ 's sake , I 've been locked up in a stone bin with bars in the windows for five days ! I broke out a couple of hours o , and ran like hell through the woods with a pack of dogs and lunatics rrying guns chasing me . I spent an hour in the water damn near drowning before I could reach land without getting my head shot off , and then I had to  --  I had to ? " " You had to what , Joel ? " asked Talbot , a strange passivity in his voice . " What did you have to do ? " " Goddamn it , Larry , I may have killed a man to get out of there ! " " You had to kill someone , Joel ? Why did you think you had to do that ? " " I le was waiting for me ! They were searching for me ! On the land , in the woods along the riverbanks  --  he was a scout separated from his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out , get away ! And you tell me not to be upset ! " " Calm down ; Joel , try to get hold of yourself .... You escaped before , did n't you ? A long time ago ? "  | " What 's that got to do with anything ? " Converse broke in . " You had to kill people then , did n't you ? Those memories must always be with you . " " Larry , that 's bullshit ! Listen to me and take down everything I say ? the names I give you , the facts  --  get it all down . " " Perhaps I should bring Janet on the line . Her shorthand ? " " No ! Only you , no one else ! They can trace people , anyone who knows anything . It 's not that complicated . Are you ready ? " " Of course . " Joel sat down on the narrow bed and took a deep breath . " The best way to put it  --  as it was put to me , but you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  is that they 've come back . " " Who ? ? " The generals  --  field marshals , admirals , colonels  --  allies and enemies , all field and fleet commanders and above . They 've come together from everywhere to change things , change governments and laws and foreign policies , everything to be based on military priorities and decisions . It 's crazy , but they could do it . We 'd live out their fantasies because they 'd be in control , believing they 're right and selfless and dedicated  --  as they 've always believed . " " Who are these people , Joel ? " " Yes , write this down . The organization is called Aquitaine . It 's based on a historical theory that the region in France once known as Aquitaine might have become all of Europe and by extension  --  as colonies  --  the North American continent as well . " " Whose theory ? " " It does n't matter , it 's just a theory . The organization was conceived by General George Delavane  --  he was known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fraction of the damage that son of a bitch did ! He 's pulled in military personnel from all over the place , all commanders , and they 're fanning out recruiting their own kind , fanatics who believe as they do , that theirs is the only way . For the past year or so , they 've been shipping illegal weapons and armaments to terrorist groups , encouraging destabilization wherever they can , the ultimate purpose being that they 'll be called in to restore order , and when they do , they 'll take over .... Five days ago I met with Delavane 's key men from France and Germany , Israel and South Africa  --  and , I think , possibly England . " " You nict with these people , Joel ? Did they invite you to a meeting ? " " ' They thought I was one of them , that I believed in everything they stood for . You sec , I . arry , they did n't know how much I hated them . They had n't been where I 'd been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , years ago . "  | " When you had to escape , " added Talbot sympathetically . " When you had to kill people  --  times you 'll never forget . They must have been terrible for you . " " Yes , they were . Goddamn it , yes ! Sorry , let 's stay on course . I 'm so tired  --  still frightened , too , I think . " " Relax , Joel . " " Sure . Where was I ? " Converse rubbed his eyes . " Oh , yes , I remember . They got information on me , information from my service record , my status as a POW , which was n't actually part of the record , but they got it and they found out what and who I was . They heard the words that told them how much I hated them , hated what Delavane had done , what they all had done . They drugged me , got whatever they could and threw me into a Godforsaken stone house set in the middle of the woods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have told them everything I knew ? " " Chemicals ? " asked Talbot , obviously never having heard the term . " Amytols , Pentothals , scopolamine . I 've been the route , Larry . I 've been there and back . " " You have ? Where ? " " In the camps . It 's immaterial . " " I 'm not sure it is . " " It is ! The point is they found out what I know . That means they 'll move up their schedule . " " Schedule ? " " We 're in the countdown . Now ! Two weeks , three weeks , four at the outside ! No one knows how or where or what the targets are , but there 'll be eruptions of violence and terrorism all over the place , giving them the excuse to move in and take over . Accumulation , " rapid acceleration , ' those were the words they used ! Right now in Northern Ireland  --  everything 's blown apart , nothing but chaos  --  whole armored divisions are moving in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ test , a trial run for them ! I 'm going to give you the names . " Converse did so , both surprised and annoyed that Talbot did not react to any of the men of Aquitaine . " Have you got them ? " " Yes , I have . " " Those are the salient facts and the names I can vouch for . There 's a lot more  --  people in the State Department and the Pentagon , but the lists are in my briefcase and it 's been stolen , or hidden somewhere . I 'll get stone rest and start writing out everything I know , then call you in the morning . I have to get out of here . I 'm going to need help . " " I agree , so may I talk now ? " said the lawyer in New York in that odd flat voice . " First , where are you , Joel ? Look on the phone or read the print on an ashtray  --  or check the desk ; there must he stationery .
