A little less Southern discomfort for air travelers <P> In sheer size no other airport in the world can match it . With its twin terminals and 138 boarding gates , the new passenger complex at the William B. Hartsfield Atlanta International Airport , which opened last week , sprawls over an area equivalent to 45 football fields . The $500 million jetport is far bigger than its closest rival : the terminal at Dallas/Fort Worth Airport covers a mere 29 football fields . <P> For frequent air travelers around the South , the opening came not a day too soon . There is a lot of truth in the old saying that : " Whether you go to heaven or hell , you have to change planes in Atlanta . " Indeed , 72% of all travelers landing in Atlanta stay only long enough to catch another flight . Both Eastern and Delta Airlines use the airport as the center of their Southern networks . Eastern passengers flying south from Mobile to Miami , for example , can get there only by first flying north to Atlanta @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Hartsfield became seriously overburdened . The old terminal , built to handle 18 million passengers annually , last year had to accommodate 42 million .

The number of conventions held there has soared from 440 in 1968 to 860 this year . Atlanta 's trade-show coliseum , the Georgia World Congress Center , already booked solid through 1989 , is asking the state legislature for $86 million to almost double its size . Hartsfield 's eight daily international flights to seven countries have also helped attract foreign firms like West Germany 's Commerzbank to Atlanta . <P> Conscious of then-past problems , Atlanta Airport officials are already planning a fourth runway that will be ready for landings and takeoffs in 1983 .
