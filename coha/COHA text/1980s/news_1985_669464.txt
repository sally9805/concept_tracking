Economists say the success of the region in finding a new direction and identity is closely tied to just how flexible its businesses and workers prove to be. // Long heavily dependent for its welfare on steel , cars , and machine tools , the Midwest is now diversifying to build its economic strength . Its trade , service , and recreation sectors are growing , though , as one economist cautions , ' ' not like gangbusters. ' ' // // Few economists predict a New England-style , high-tech rebirth for the Midwest . But neither do they expect the industrial heartland to qualify for ' ' the new Appalachia ' ' label some have suggested. // Manufacturing , which is now undergoing a radical restructuring in many industries , will remain a key ingredient in the Midwestern economic mix . Both states and manufacturers have been making strong efforts to diversify , while attempting to add to their industrial base : // // * Michigan , already producing about one-third of the nation ' s robots , has welcomed two new wood particle-board plants and one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on forestry products. // // * US Steel Corporation , concentrating heavily on oil and gas production , now limits steel production to one-third of its operations. // // * The nation ' s top automakers are producing everything from robots to semiconductors. // The new , trimmed-down and automated auto industry is once again concentrating production in the Midwest . Several new plants and expansions have recently been announced . US automakers now see quick delivery of limited inventories and a proximity to suppliers as vital to keeping up with overseas competition. // During the last two years Indiana , which has the highest concentration of manufacturing workers of any state in the Midwest , has drawn a $1. 7 billion spending commitment from General Motors alone. // Tennessee won General Motors ' much coveted Saturn plant that is expected to set a new industry model in high-tech design , engineering , production , and sales . But Saturn will still be close enough to Midwest auto-parts suppliers to keep its inventory streamlined. // The new regional concentration also affects foreign producers . Both the Toyota Motor Corporation and Mitsubishi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , say the chief contending sites for their new assembly plants are in the Midwest. // But even with such positive signs , precisely what the new days will bring - and just how good they ' ll be - are not yet clear . Yet , the gloomy headlines of the last five years , largely a tale of closed factories and rising unemployment , are not necessarily a sample of more to come. // To a limited extent , lost manufacturing jobs have been replaced by service jobs that usually pay much less. // From 1979 to 1984 , the seven-state Midwestern region lost almost 1 million , or 17. 3 percent , of its manufacturing jobs . There are currently about 4. 8 million manufacturing workers in this region , while in 1979 there were about 5. 8 million . The number of service jobs , however , has increased by nearly half a million since 1979. // With the bulk of the region ' s jobs still hanging on manufacturing , possibly the toughest challenge is modernization of old industries . How will high-tech fit into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? A number of economists say Midwest high tech has developed more strongly in production than in research. // ' ' High tech is developing rather rapidly in the Midwest , ' ' says Northwestern University ' s Louis Masotti , who headed a task force on Illinois ' s high-tech growth. // ' ' It ' s quiet and not as highly concentrated or as sexy in substance as Silicon Valley . But in the biomedical , pharmaceutical , and telecommunications areas we have a strong base and considerable potential. ' ' // Robert Schnorbus , an economist with the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland , says he sees little solid evidence yet that Midwest manufacturing has incorporated enough high-tech advances to keep it competitive. // ' ' I ' m not sure we ' re getting our share of that long-term investment , ' ' he says . ' ' I haven ' t yet seen the great influx of robots that have been argued to be the salvation of this region ' s manufacturing base. ' ' // Even a company on the leading edge of machine-tool technology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with imports , Dr. Schnorbus notes . Though his state of Ohio is one of the largest producers of computers and office equipment , the growth of comparable firms in such states as Texas and California has sent its relative share of the market down , he says . Ohio , in his view , will remain a major hard-goods producer. // ' ' Whether or not we can make the transition into the high-tech end is , I think , still up in the air , ' ' Schnorbus says . Other economists in the region are also divided on whether or not the worst is over for the Midwest. // Some , like Washington University economist Charles Leven , who keeps a particularly watchful eye on metropolitan areas , insists it is . He points to the revitalizing of many ' ' post industrial ' ' cities in the region as proof. // ' ' The notion that the future of the Midwest or of any American city is tied to its ability to attract industry is just wrong , ' ' he says . Despite the recent loss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Louis , Detroit , Pittsburgh , and Cleveland - each of the cities has attracted billions of dollars of new investment in hotels , shops , and stores. // ' ' Somebody believes there ' s a great future in these old cities , ' ' says Dr. Leven . ' ' And the transition has been much faster than I would have thought - what ' s taken 10 years I thought would have taken 50. ' ' // Schnorbus , however , is unconvinced that all ' ' marginal ' ' industries that are going to fail have yet been weeded out . ' ' My most optimistic view is that we ' re bottoming out . . . . I ' m unwilling to say when we hit rock bottom , ' ' he says. // Next : How one Midwest city battled to create jobs. // // // //
