THE TALK OF THE TOWN Notes and Comment AYOUNG friend writes : When I was a kid , I lived near what must have been one of the first McDonald 's hamburger stands , out in the San Fernando Valley , in Los Angeles , and I could swear I still remember the banner sashed across the arches ? " OvER 1,000,000 SERVED . " McDonald 's must have been in its infancy in those days  --  the number of franchise outlets still a mere handful  --  because that proud banner grew sun-bleached and tattered over a period of many months , perhaps even years , before it needed to be replaced by the next one , announcing " OVER 10,000,000 SERVED . " And it took another long time , I remember , though , strangely , not as long , before it proved necessary to sew another zero on . It 's often been said that for children time seems hardly to move at all  --  that existence seems a virtually still , undifferentiated pool , and it 's only with the coming of adolescence that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which presently becomes a rapids , surging toward some suddenly approaching completion . In a way , that McDonald 's banner  --  and I pass by its plastic reincarnation every few years on return visits to L.A. ? had functioned as an odometer in my life , gauging the relentless acceleration in my own sense of time , the zeros accumulating ineluctably , until a while back , when the gauge itself seemed to burst , despairing , perhaps , of even the possibility of keeping any accurate track . " BILLIONS AND BILLIONS SERVED " was all it seemed able to muster . I was thinking about that banner the other day as one of the commentators from Geneva rehashed the figures on the multiplication of nuclear weapons in the world 's arsenals over the past few decades : from several hundred in the early fifties to over fifty thou sand today . The world seems poised on the brink of a new hyperbolic surge in the sheer number of these weapons , especially if the upcoming round of talks grinds to deadlock and the Soviets respond to our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offensive " missiles buildup , designed to swamp even our most elaborate defensive schemes , and if we then feel that we have to deploy an equivalent number of missiles , because , after all , maybe our defensive screen wo n't work , and , in any case , we ca n't allow the Soviets to have more missiles than we have , and if then , in response to all this , the other nations of the world simply abandon even the charade of nonproliferation , arguing that the entire nonproliferation movement was always based on the presumption that the two superpowers would simultaneously be pursuing some sort of good-faith effort at arms restraint and now , as was quickly becoming evident , all such bets were off . Clearly , we 're past the pool and into the creek and well on our way toward the rapids . And the strange thing about all this , of course , is that we 're talking here about weapons , not hamburgers : weapons of incredible  --  indeed , definitive  --  potential , and you 'd think that such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some surge in raw animosity , sheer hatred , which might help explain the need for all these procurements . But when you go looking for that hatred , for its actual location in the hearts of the people of the world , it proves at best a metastable entity . For example , Secretary Shultz and Foreign Minister Gromyko and their delegations made a great show of personal congeniality in the television images being beamed back from Geneva . Now , part of that was obviously diplomatic posing , for effect . But I doubt whether Shultz personally hates Gromyko , or Reagan personally hates Chernenko ( they 've never even met ) . The private in training at Fort Bragg , I 'm sure , holds no personal grudge against some sailor stationed in Murmansk . And I myself am unaware of anyone , any group of people , in the Soviet Union whom I despise so intensely that I 'd be willing to risk the world 's annihilation in order to indulge my hatred . Usually , when you proceed a bit farther with this particular train of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course the hatred is n't personal  --  it 's abstract , it 's systemic , it 's two systems locked in mortal opposition . " But my point is that I 've lost the sense of even that systemic opposition 's being sufficiently impacted to account for the numbers of weapons we 're now gathering . Naturally , I recognize the reality of fundamental differences between our two systems  --  differing conceptions of economic organization , differing values placed on individual rights versus class prerogatives , the varying geopolitical imperatives of national security , and so forth . I do n't minimize their importance for a minute . And Afghanistan and Poland and El Salvador and Chile are all very troubling . I 've just lost the sense that those sorts of opposition any longer have anything to do with this exponentially growing arms race . Indeed , for me the arms race has long since ceased to seem to be about opposition , hatred , or animosity at all ; rather , it seems as if it had become an alliance , a sort of perverse love match , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other 's prowess , each side desperately trying to concoct new and even more intoxicating ways of holding the other 's rapt , undivided attention . I 'm reminded now of another vision from my childhood  --  or , rather , in this case , from later on , sometime in my adolescence . One summer , a B-movie science-fiction thriller enjoyed brief favor among my friends . It was called " Colossus , " although in some cities it was apparently released under the name " The Forbin Project . " Forbin was a genius scientist who 'd created a supermegacomputer , literally as big as a mountain , which was presently put in direct , unique , and irrevocable command of all American nuclear weapons , overriding any human agency and thereby supposedly overriding any human frailty that our opponents might have been tempted to imagine could lead to hesitation on our part in the event of their mischief . Deterrence , sanctified and assured for all time ! Only , it turned out that the Russians had one of these machines , too , and soon the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they could explore each other 's memory banks . The scientists on each side , sure of the superior design of their own system , approved the idea , and an elaborate telecommunications network was established between the two computers . And this is the scene I recall best . For as the computers began prob ing each other 's memory banks  --  you could visualize the process through an electronic wall map displaying the burgeoning lines of global contact , and you could hear the process in the ever more frenzied clatter of the various telemetries , and you knew that things were getting out of hand because of the way the human beings watching were becoming increasingly anxious and then desperate about this unsupervised and unsupervisable exchange of data  --  the whole thing seemed to become like some berserk cybernetic form of sexual intercourse : the two systems were locked in an endlessly tightening copulative embrace . That movie wound up being about Dr. Forbin 's attempts to wrest control back from the merged and increasingly monomaniacal machines ( he failed ) , but the image that persists is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that image that seems to anticipate our situation today  --  to outline the essential contours of our predicament . Hatred is sterile . It 's love that makes all these babies , fifty thousand and still counting : immensely perverted , mutually addictive systemic enthrallment . " Only connect , " wrote E. M. Forster , but lack of connectedness is not our problem today . We 're connecting like crazy . Rather , we must find some way of disconnecting the passionate complex systems that have taken over from us , and then invent a new , benign way of connecting with each other . ? ? Tiger Tops AMAN we know came back from Nepal recently with this report : If you do n't count the grounds of the Royal Palace , in the center of Kathmandu , the most carefully protected piece of the environment in Nepal is a wedge-shaped patch of grasslands and jungle , thirty miles long , down by the border with India , at the upper edge of the great Ganges plain . The altitude there is only a few hundred feet above sea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( Before I got to Nepal , I had no idea that the country 's environment included anything but mountains , much less actual jungle . ) Three hundred soldiers , armed with heavy carbines , patrol its boundaries , and Gurkhas in snappy uniforms man checkpoints on the few jeep tracks that lead into it . In 1976 , it was officially ga. - zetted as Nepal 's first national park , Royal Chitwan . At the moment , its population includes more than three hundred one-horned rhinoceroses and forty adult Bengal tigers . Back at the beginning of the nine-teen-fifties , that patch of jungle needed no protection at all . In fact , it was considered nearly uninhabitable . If Sir Edmund Hillary- had decided in 1953 to lead his famous expedi-tion down into the Chitwan Valley instead of up to the summit of Mt . Everest , native Nepalis would probably have considered it a more dangerous trip . The problem was not tigers  --  even though there were quite a few more of them back then  --  but mosquitoes . The lowlands of Nepal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the fiercest malaria regions in the world . Only a few local tribes could survive there . so the tigers and rhinos had the place more or less to themselves . Then DDT arrived , and , almost overnight , did for the country 's strip of lowlands what irrigation has done for the American West . To a nation of subsistence farmers , accustomed to narrow hillside terraces and Asian THE NEW YORKER overcrowding , the Terai suddenly became the land of opportunity . Today , the three hundred and sixty square miles of Chitwan Park are a rich island of natural resources in a sea of scarcity  --  a reminder of the Terai 's former bounty . Inside the guarded boundaries , elephant grass grows forty feet tall in the marshes , and a solid green mat of forest covers the hills . Just outside the boundary line , however , across a small river , cattle scuff at land that looks as worn and bare as a municipal playground . Trees outside the park have the knobby look of sycamores in winter , because every time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet off the ground , someone shinnies up with a machete and lops it off , to feed to his cattle . " By moving people down from the hills , the government bought some time , maybe twenty years , " I was told by Charles McDougal , an internationally recognized tiger expert , " but it also destroyed half the resources in the Terai . And now the country 's overcrowding and deforestation problems are worse than they were before . " Dr. McDougal , a soft-spoken American with smooth white hair and a face handsome enough for a television series , spent a dozen years tracking tigers on foot through the Chit-wan jungle in order to study their behavior , and he knows each one in the park by name and pug mark . Understandably , his sympathies are with continued park protection . " In those hills behind the lodge , you can wander around for five or six days and not see anyone , " he told me . " It 's the only place in Nepal where that 's true , unless you get high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ McDougal is also a director of the company that owns a remarkable tourist lodge called Tiger Tops , which offers accommodations for several dozen guests in two buildings on stilts , high above the jungle floor , and a stable of twenty or so elephants for sightseeing , rhino-chasing , and taxi service . Every evening during an eight-month season , the staff at Tiger Tops stakes out a ? ? goat at one spot in the jungle and a young water buffalo at another , in the hope of attracting a leopard and a tiger , respectively . In the event of a visit , a bell is rung back at the lodge , and guests put down their cocktails or get up from the dinner table , take a quick jeep ride to within a few hundred yards , and creep into blinds to watch . The practice , like Tiger Tops itself , started long before there was any talk of a national park . From villages across the boundary , beyond the patrolling soldiers , it is a little hard to understand the nightly sacrifice of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or the regular use of a decorative fireplace that in one evening can go through enough wood to last a villager 's stove for months  --  merely for tourist amusement . Even if the local villagers can keep from resenting the contrast with their subsistence struggle , and the locking away at gunpoint of the last remaining wealth of fodder and fuel for the benefit of some romantic wildlife and a few rich foreigners , the park will not leave the villagers alone . The rifles of the guards keep poachers out but not the wildlife in . Tigers occasionally wander out and kill people 's buffalo ; and rhinos come over at night so often to graze that the villagers have built permanent lookout towers in their fields . Yet they need the park , too . It has the only grasslands left in the area which can supply the thatch and the long , strong reeds from which native roofs and walls are made . Every year , the park is opened in January , and , for a permit fee of a quarter of a rupee ( less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who comes on foot has two weeks in which to cut and take away as much elephant grass as he can carry . Last year , the park warden of Royal Chitwan issued sixty thousand permits . The Tiger Tops operation keeps up close relations with Nepal 's monarchy ( a few years ago , when its managing director at the time , James Edwards , was married , in Switzerland , King Birendra 's brother Prince Gyanendra attended the wedding ) , and it benefits from royal favor . So does the park . " If it were n't for the royal family , one questions whether we would have any conservation program at all , " Dr. McDougal said . " The pressure to use up those resources would just he too strong . If people were running for election , national parks would be one of the first things they 'd go after . " The country 's recent experience seems to bear out Dr. McDougal 's opinion : while a referendum on political liberalization was pending in 1980 , and King Birendra was in the unusual position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laws against poaching dropped off almost to nothing . The native Nepalis I got to know had a different attitude toward the virtues of tourism ( and , in private , toward the virtues of near-absolute monarchy ) , but all of them told me the same thing : the slim hope that their country would find a way to renew the trees and grass that are basic elements of survival for most of Nepal 's sixteen million people was being kept alive by royal patronage and Western affection for a few big wild beasts . The Secretary TN the red sandstone castle that 1 serves as the headquarters of the Smithsonian Institution , in Washington , D.C. , we talked recently with Robert McC . Adams , the Institution 's new Secretary . Mr. Adams is a tall man of fifty-eight with a brush mustache , graying hair swept back into curls , a handsome , active face , and an informal , bracing manner . As Secretary , he directs the Smithsonian 's thirteen museums ( ranging from the National Air and Space Museum to the Cooper-Hewitt National Museum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ National Zoological Park ( Ling-Ling , the giant panda , is its most famous resident ) , and a half-dozen research centers ( from the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory , at Harvard , to the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute , in Panama ) . In his new office , where maps of various parts of the Middle and Near East lay on the floor , the Secretary told us how he had prepared for the job . " I think there 's a large element of chance and uncertainty in the world , " he observed in an amiable baritone . " And I think we ought to welcome that in the way interests develop . I get depressed about the creeping tendency of people to try to define their career lines very narrowly at an early point , and not just flow with the times . For people like me , coming back from the Second World War , there was the marvellous advantage of the G.I. Bill and the sense of freedom to try a little of this and a little of that . I started out in 1943 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of being JANUARY 21,1985 a physicist and , after a year and a half , found my interest turning to the social sciences . Then I went into the Navy , was trained as a radar technician , and , about when the war ended , was assigned to Shanghai . I had the sense of world history exploding all around me , and I felt liberated to try whatever I wanted . I came back to the University of Chicago with the idea of studying economics , history , or political science , or something like that , and it was several years before I started to focus on anthropology , which has been my field ever since . Almost accidentally , I got the opportunity to go to Iraq as part of an archeological expedition to the Kurdish foothills , and at some point in the course of the journey I came to the conclusion that that was one hell of a good life . " The Secretary smiled with pleasure , and continued , " I became an anthropologist  --  an archeologist , really  --  with the University @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , taught there , became director of the university 's Oriental Institute , and , during the past couple of years , served as provost , until this job came along . " " How did you get the chance to go on your first dig ? " we asked . The Secretary rolled up his sleeves ( he wore a checked shirt ) , loosened his tie ( Scotch plaid ) , and put his feet on his desk ( rubber-soled shoes on a big wooden desk that was topped by a computer ) . " I had a course or two with an anthropologist named Bob Braidwood , " he said . " Rather late in the game , another man was forced to drop out of a Braidwood party bound for points east . That put the professor in a jam . I had been full of enthusiasm for the whole industrial process , and I had moved down to South Chicago to work in a Ford assembly plant and then in a U.S. Steel mill . I was working in the mill at the time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attend two classes out of three . So I was around , and Bob asked me to come along . It 's been said that he decided , Well , to hell with it , I want to take somebody who can fix my car , ' but you 'd have to ask him . " Mr. Adams smiled again . " In any event , I found myself picked up from a spot as a graduate student and a sometime factory worker and transported to a remote area known as Jarmo . Out on a bare Kurdish hillside , we had to build ourselves a mud house and put the wiring in and arrange for food supplies  --  all the most elementary things  --  and then we began an intensely interesting THE NEW YOKKER process of excavating . Braidwood was a pioneer . He was one of the first to develop goals tied to solving problems , rather than to finding the earliest something or the biggest something or the most whatever . He was concerned with the process by which people who had lived by gathering food took up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought we might come to understand that process better through excavating . It was an early village , and there were remains of pottery and stone tools . Braidwood brought in all kinds of specialists , and they worked with each other in new ways . Geomorphologists and paleozoologists , and so on , cooperated to extract new kinds of information from those remains . It was a demandinLintellectual enterprise . There were no fixed rules . And the people we were with , in the neighboring villages and among the Arab pickmen who helped us at the site , were wonderful . I just loved it . " Mr. Adams has written scores of articles and several books , with titles like " Land Behind Baghdad " and " The Uruk Countryside , " and his most respected scholarly volume ( " Twenty years of a brilliant mind 's labors on the six-thousand-year history of settlement and subsistence in southern Mesopotamia , " according to a dust-jacket blurb from a professor in his field ) is called " Heartland of Cities : Surveys of Ancient Settlement and Land Use on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ described the work that led to this book . " For most of my time in the field , I 've been involved with studies of long-term cycles of growth and decline , collapse and regeneration of cities and civilization , " he said . " I think it 's a marvellous subject , for you enjoy quite a different perspective from most traditional studies , which concern relatively short spans of time . The techniques by which one does this kind of work in the Middle East involve poking around in the countryside , to a good extent on foot , and they also involve the use of air photographs . I picked those up back in 1957 from people doing work in modern agricultural development , and I 've never been willing to work without the photographs since . The uncultivated areas of Iraq  --  and the same is true elsewhere  --  have been barren for a thousand years . You 've had the wind blowing freely across them , scouring the land . The result is that you can trace networks of canals underlying one another  --  they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an extraordinarily detailed picture of what these successive landscapes were like over a very long period . If you have that in hand , you have clues to the organization of agriculture and the nature of irrigation and then to the density of population and the extent of city life . With this sort of information , you can take a new look at everything else you know about the historical remains that have been studied for so long . I 've been doing this for twenty-eight years now . I 'd like to do more , but , because of the political situation in the Middle East  --  the reconnaissance in my sort of work makes people nervous , when I can get in to do it at all , and that has n't been easy for years  --  and because of my new post , I do n't know when it 's going to happen . " " What do you have in mind for the Smithsonian ? " we asked . " Most people know the Smithsonian through its museums , " Mr. Adams said . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the little jewel that holds a collection of Oriental art . But the physical plant is all around , and anyone who comes to Washington would have a hard time missing it . The Smithsonian is the greatest of this country 's museums . But that 's only the tip of the iceberg . If the Institution did n't exist , with its quasi-governmental position and its long tradition of respectable research , we would have to create something like it . The day is past when Western scholars and scientists could assume they were going to do most of the scientific research with relatively unimpeded access to the rest of the world . And now we need new kinds of institutions , or linkages between places that already exist , in which the United States and other countries can join in research . The Smithsonian is as good a place to begin as any . When this country received the bequest that led to the establishment of this place , it was for the increase and diffusion of knowledge . ' I intend to lean on the former . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intellectual effort . Even in these early days in office , and even without having a clear picture of what the Smithsonian 's role ought to be , I propose to start talking about it . "
