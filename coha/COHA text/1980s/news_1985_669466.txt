Welcome to Menominee County. // Welcome , too , to the Wolf River , which runs beside this highway and which turns out to be the best path through this stretch of Wisconsin wilderness. // // Don ( Chuck ) Conn pilots his pickup along this road , about 85 miles northwest of Green Bay , just north of the 230 , 000-acre reservation comprising the entire county and holding a population of about 3 , 000. // Mr. Conn , a local resident who teaches school on the Menominee tribal reservation and augments his living in the summer by hauling rafters and rubber boats back and forth here , talks as he drives about the brisk competition for tourists between his operation and other rafting outfits , like Shotgun Eddie ' s , whose signs pepper the highway. // As he talks , a wall of forest slips by on either side , thinning out more and more the farther we get from the reservation on our way to a deserted stretch of river far tamer than the twisting , tight , swift run farther downstream . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my son and me , for their maiden run ; and the last thing they need is a plunge into the thick of rapids and white water. // Like most of the raft renters in the area , he offers two trips : a two-hour run for those wanting a quick and less eventful taste of the river , and a five-hour pitch down to the reservation line along the river ' s more bumpy , drenching course . ( Only Menominee are allowed to rent rafts on their part of the river . But all along this stretch of the river , you can camp overnight in one of the numerous campgrounds - around $6-$10 for a single site , $25 for a group - and pay $14-$25 for the raft rental , depending on how long your ride is. ) // Chuck Conn pulls his pickup into a prosaic setting - a flat dirt road across the highway from a roadhouse - then , 20 or 30 feet off the road , he brakes suddenly and jumps out. // Together , the three of us drag the large rubber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wet , sticky sand and through the tall grass to the riverbank . The river can be dangerous when it is running high in the spring and after heavy rainfall . But here it ' s only a wide , flat stream , stretching maybe 25 yards across . It showed , around the occasional rock in its belly , an appreciable but not particularly exciting current. // We slipped onto the glassy surface of the water and began to move downstream . Quickly we lost sight of the road , and all there was was grass and trees and this water bearing us along . Now and then we ' d get swirled into a sudden rush of water and mini-rapids , which would inevitably hang us up on the rocks because we didn ' t know how to steer or row properly . But more often we glided along , listening to the whispers of wind and water and watching insects circle above small eddies that promised them a quick breakfast. // The ride was a disappointment to my son , who had been in a few amusement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about spills and thrills . Of these , there were precious few . The Wolf River is known for its wildness , but not especially in late August when it ' s much tamer , and not in this stretch . Still , there was something else here , a prelude to the river downstream and the country that surrounds it. // The thing you remember about this surrounding country is the quiet . That and the trees. // The Menominee own a productive sawmill . But by most commercial standards , the vast tract of reservation land is underutilized . Instead of neat replanted stretches of forest , you see the dense , wild undergrowth that grows over itself time and again and looks as impenetrable and solitary as anything early settlers must have encountered. // Take state road 55 down from Langlade to Shawano , and you ' ll soon find yourself immersed in this closely held Menominee world and its forested solitude. // With a ratio of only one person to about about 75 acres , you ' ll see a lot more land than Menominees . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ according to local observers . That may be overstating the case , since there is at least one road back into the Dalles , a corner of the river where the tribe charges visitors a nominal fee to come and sample their land. // If you turn right on a poorly marked road about nine miles south of the juncture between 55 and county road WW , you can make your way back on the rutted road , over a wooden bridge . ( You ' re ill-advised to turn just anywhere , since many of these roads are considered private by the Menominee ; and they are considered dangerous by some local residents . ) The forest canopy bends over from time to time , and it looks like you are on a road to nowhere . But , eventually , a clearing appears . Once you pay 50 cents to the Menominee tribeswoman , you can follow the arrows leading over rocks and through quiet crevices in the land. // Just beyond the network of open paths and clearings lies deep forest . And through the forest the sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the river itself until you clamber up the side of a ravine , onto some high rocks , and quite suddenly below you the Wolf River appears , running through a narrow neck of rock cliffs maybe 20 feet high. // I hoisted myself into one of the few trees clinging to the sides of the small cliff , finding a perch where I could see some people waiting for a glimpse of a river raft . We didn ' t have long to wait . By the time my family , a few dozen yards behind me , came upon the scene , a small rubber raft was spinning around a corner of the cliffs and shooting down river , fast and out of control. // The look on the passengers ' faces was mingled delight and bewilderment , as if they were doing something they always knew would be fun but never knew it would be this furious . We aren ' t talking Colorado river-rafting here , but even in this place , surrounded by thousands of acres of forest , a foaming river was flinging its human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Suspended there above the scene , a camera in my hand , leaning precariously over the edge , I caught the eye of a boy in the boat . And the smile he shot back at me said in an instant what a thousand words could never say : We both had found a wild , free place to take ourselves on a summer afternoon. // // Last of a series . First four parts ran on May 21 , June 18 , July 16 , and Aug. 27. // // //
