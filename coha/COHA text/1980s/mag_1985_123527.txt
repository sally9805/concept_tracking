For 55 minutes and 50 seconds Sunday in the Orange Bowl , the Miami Dolphins ' Dan Marino was a mere mortal , a struggling young quarterback . The Pittsburgh Steelers were leading 20-17 and Marino 's last two series had ended chaotically . He was intercepted deep in his own territory , setting up the field goal that put Pittsburgh ahead , and then he was intercepted at the Steeler 22 , killing a chance at a score that could win or tie it . Now the Dolphins were on their own 25 with 4:10 left . // Zip , nine yards to Tony Nathan in the right flat . Zip , 27 to Mark Clayton , the ball finding the open spot in what had been a very nasty zone defense . The Steelers had come into the game with the NFL 's No. 1 pass defense , and this afternoon they had shown Marino why . // Zip , 22 yards to Bruce Hardy , an anonymous tight end for eight seasons , and this was the prettiest play of the day because Mike Merriweather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to extend to his full 6 ' 5 " to make a diving catch of a pass that was low and away , the only place it could have been thrown . // " I do n't even think he saw the ball , " said Steeler strong safety Donnie Shell . " I mean , he stuck out his hands and the ball was there . " // " How do you figure it ? " said David Shula , the Dolphins ' receivers and quarterback coach . " Here 's a guy who runs a 5.2 40 being covered by another guy who runs a 4.6 . The pass and the catch had to be absolutely perfect . " // The ball was on the Steeler 16 . Four plays and two completions later , it was on the two , and when Lorenzo Hampton scored on a sweep left behind guard Jeff Toews 's block that wiped out two Steelers , the Dolphins had the lead with 47 seconds remaining ; the hunt was over . // Final score , 24-20 , and another chapter in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times . He had misfired , and he had forced the ball into areas where there was n't any room . He had made some poor decisions , but when it came time to do it , well , there it was . // " I was n't patient . I was n't taking what was there , " he said . " You have to learn from it . " He was standing on a bench next to his locker , talking through a forest of microphones . The people in back were straining to hear what he was saying . // " They did n't rush more than three guys , " he said . " They were playing lots of people in coverage and taking the deep stuff away . They had a great defensive scheme against us. " // Across the way Tony Dungy , the Steelers ' young defensive coordinator , was waiting to get on the team bus to the airport . Sunday was his 30th birthday . // Last year , in Dungy 's first season as coordinator , the Steelers lost to Miami @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Championship game . They had blitzed Marino and made him throw on the run . But then , as the championship game was slipping away , they had rushed three and dropped everyone else back into coverage , and Marino had licked his chops and eaten this setup alive . But it was a different situation then . It was a mixer , a change-up , something the Steeler defenders were n't really married to . They were n't comfortable playing that kind of slow-death football . // Before Sunday 's game , quotes from Dungy had appeared in the Miami papers indicating that Marino was going to see all manner of Steelers shooting at him from all angles . " The Blitzburgh Steelers , " one paper called them . Dungy is young , but he learns fast . The Steelers blitzed zero in the game . Oh , they occasionally sent in a linebacker to complement the three-man rush , but in the lexicon of pro football a four-man assault is not considered a blitz . You have to come with more than four people to qualify . // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Most of the time Pittsburgh did n't even go into a four-man line , the traditional starting point of nickel and dime defenses . Instead , Dungy devised a bewildering assortment of schemes , never repeating a coverage on successive downs . // " It 's difficult to blitz Marino and think you 're going to get to him , " Dungy had said the day before the game . He was sitting in his hotel room , staring out at the little pleasure boats in Biscayne Bay , knowing full well that Sunday would be a big day in the life of a young and ambitious defensive assistant . " He sees the blitzes as well as anyone . You blitz him to make him throw early , not to sack him . The key thing is the mixture in your coverages , to give him something different every play . A formation might work for a while , but then he gets a bead on it . You 've got to be patient , too . If they make five yards , you ca n't throw up your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get enough pressure on him with your front four , so everybody else can play coverages . That 's what San Francisco did in the Super Bowl . " // Marino put together two drives for touchdowns in the first half against Pittsburgh , and a field goal drive on the opening series of the third quarter . However , in the first half he tried to go up on top to Clayton , into double coverage , and free safety Eric Williams intercepted . The interception that set up the final Steeler field goal came when Marino tried to lay the ball in to Nat Moore over linebacker Robin Cole 's deep drop , and Cole leaped high , tipped the ball with one hand and then caught it . Marino 's third interception , matching his single-game high , came when cornerback Dwayne Woodruff snapped up a short sideline pass to Clayton with a great closing burst . // Marino 's numbers looked decent , 27 completions in 45 attempts for 277 yards and a TD ( with 18 of the completions going to backs or tight ends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wound up with a grade of 57.36 , well below average , thanks mainly to the three intercepts . Most defense coaches would be very happy to concede a 57.36 score to Marino . // Even with Marino 's last-minute heroics , the Steelers put enough defense on the field to win the game if their offense had been anywhere near as proficient . But it struggled all day . Mark Malone 's passes were off target ( he was 14 for 33 for 145 yards and one score ) . Two drives were killed when the snap from center was fumbled . Pittsburgh 's first four series basically consisted of three downs and out . // The defense that Miami threw at Malone was almost a mirror of Pittsburgh 's . Chuck Studley , the Dolphins ' defense coach , has been around . He put together the 49er defense that beat Cincinnati in the ' 82 Super Bowl . Fifty-six years old , six kids , 17 years in the NFL , does n't like to shave late in the week before games ... oh yes , he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on early downs to try to foul up the Steelers ' ground game , but on passing downs rush only three or four and drop everyone else back into coverage . // Malone is a fine athlete , able to scramble away from a blitz , but the idea was to get him thinking , to give him a lot of defensive people to worry about downfield , and the plan worked beautifully . // The loss left the Steelers 2-3 and wondering where their next meal is coming from , while the Dolphins are 4-1 and facing a Monday-night showdown against the 4-1 Jets  --  followed by the soft part of their schedule . Best of all , they 've got an older and wiser Marino to lead them through it .
