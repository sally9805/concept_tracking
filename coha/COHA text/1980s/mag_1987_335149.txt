Like many other private men 's organizations , the nearly 20,000 worldwide chapters of the Rotary International are not all that private . That was one reason why last week the U.S. Supreme Court unanimously upheld the use of a state antidiscrimination law to bar Rotary International from ousting a California chapter that had admitted women . Noting the clubs ' sizable membership , turnover rate and public activities , Justice Lewis Powell concluded that " the relationship among Rotary Club members is not the kind of intimate or private relation that warrants constitutional protection . " About 30 states have laws similar to California 's . The Justices said other organizations will be considered on a case-by-case basis , but some thought they could read the writing on the clubhouse wall for such venerable male bastions as the Kiwanis and the Lions . " The Wednesday night men 's poker club may still be safe , " said Rotary International President-elect Charles Keller , " but I do n't know what else is. "              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
