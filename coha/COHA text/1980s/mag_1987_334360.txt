The well-dressed crowd of 700 , representing much of California 's Democratic establishment , waited expectantly after a sellout dinner in the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion . At the front tables were such glitterati as Actress Jane Fonda and her husband Assemblyman Tom Hayden , former California Governor Pat Brown and Film Producer Irwin Winkler . But as New York Governor Mario Cuomo prepared to deliver his speech , an oyster shucker working nearby was puzzled by all the hoopla . " What 's the deal ? " he asked . " Is he running for something ? " <P> The question has dogged Cuomo for months , and in Los Angeles he again deflected it with his usual response : " The big question you have to decide is whether you ought to be President . " But the role of Hamlet does not suit him well . Within the next week or so Cuomo is expected to declare his intentions , and political pros expect him to take the first tentative steps toward running . <P> For the past year Cuomo has stuck close to home , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But this Monday he goes to New Orleans and next week to Florida , and he plans further appearances this spring in New Hampshire and Iowa . He has met privately with top national strategists , among them Bob Shrum , Ted Kennedy 's former word wizard , and Gerald Rafshoon , Jimmy Carter 's media adviser . <P> Although his rhetoric can inspire , Cuomo must now show that his message can sell . His vague vision of the nation-as-strikes some as mushy old liberalism . Notoriously thin-skinned and confrontational with critics , he will have to learn to endure the endless fleabites that come from relentless questioning on the campaign trail . But unlike other potential candidates , Cuomo does not need to scrounge for attention ; he is sure to draw crowds , and reporters will trail him like stardust wherever he goes . He has a $4.5 million war chest left over from his landslide re-election and an aura that will quickly put him on a par with Gary Hart as a Democratic front runner . <P> They will have plenty of company . Missouri Congressman Richard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Governor Bruce Babbitt will do so in early March . Delaware Senator Joe Biden , who has been collecting consultants and giving rousing speeches , said last Friday that he definitely plans to run , and Georgia Senator Sam Nunn , who has been urged on by moderates , plans to decide by the end of the month .
