NEW YORK  --  Richard C. Gallop is resigning as president and chief operating officer of Coca-Cola Co. ' s Columbia Pictures Industries Inc. unit to join the investment banking firm of Allen &; Co . Columbia said it wouldn ' t name a successor after Mr. Gallop leaves at the end of the year . Mr. Gallop , who is 47 years old and joined Columbia as its general counsel in 1981 , is responsible for Columbia ' s motion picture and foreign operations ; he will stay on as a consultant to Francis T. Vincent Jr. , president and chief executive officer of Coke ' s Entertainment Business sector , which includes Columbia . Mr. Gallop ' s move to Allen &; Co. allows Columbia to streamline its top-heavy management structure while keeping Mr. Gallop in the family . In addition to Mr. Gallop ' s new consulting job with Coke , Allen &; Co. is Columbia ' s investment banker , and Allen &; Co. ' s president , Herbert A. Allen Jr. , was chairman of Columbia when Coke purchased it in 1981 , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are close friends , and Mr. Allen said Mr. Gallop ' s legal and entertainment background would be of " great value " to Allen &; Co . Mr. Gallop ' s departure comes on the heels of several management changes Mr. Vincent has made at Columbia in recent months in an attempt to reverse losses at Columbia ' s motion picture operations . Although Columbia has posted respectable earnings gains last year thanks to its television and videocassette businesses , its motion picture production operations had a loss last year because of a string of box office failures . In June , Columbia hired British film producer David Puttnam to replace Guy McElwaine as chairman and chief executive of the motion picture division . Mr. McElwaine , who was asked to resign last April , was responsible for choosing Columbia ' s movies , and reported to Mr. Gallop , who in turn reported to Mr. Vincent . Many in the industry viewed that management structure as cumbersome ; Mr. Puttnam will now report directly to Mr. Vincent . Mr. Gallop said he had been discussing the possibility of joining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Allen &; Co. is a loosely structured partnership in which individual bankers typically pursue their own transactions , and their compensation is determined solely by the size and number of transactions they complete . " It ' s an opportunity to do deals in an entrepreneurial , non-bureaucratic environment , " Mr. Gallop said . Mr. Allen said that Mr. Gallop would likely diversify beyond entertainment business . He noted that while a partner at the New York law firm Millbank , Tweed , Hadley &; McCloy , Mr. Gallop represented non-entertainment clients , such as members of the Rockefeller family and Amerada Hess Co . Although Columbia ' s Mr. Puttnam is currently negotiating to bring in longtime industry executive David Picker as his second in command at Columbia ' s movie unit , Mr. Vincent said no other major changes are planned immediately at Columbia . But Mr. Gallop ' s departure makes Coke executive vice president Frank Biondi , 41 , the second-ranked executive at the Coke Entertainment Business unit . Mr. Biondi , formerly chief executive of Time Inc. ' s Home Box Office , has overseen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purchases , Embassy Communications Inc. and Merv Griffin Enterprises . Although Mr. Vincent said it was premature to elaborate on Mr. Biondi ' s future role , company insiders said Mr. Biondi will probably take on greater responsibilities at Columbia ' s television operations in a further streamlining move by the end of the year . At present , Columbia Pictures Television is managed separately from Embassy and Merv Griffin Enterprises , which many in the industry view as inefficient , as all three units are in the television business .
