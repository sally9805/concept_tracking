It was bad enough for New York Yacht Club members when they lost the America 's Cup in 1983 on Rhode Island Sound . The longest winning streak in sport history  --  132 years  --  was ended , and with Australia II 's secret keel , the victors from down under had audaciously out-teched the Yanks . But what really steamed some of the bluer-blooded Newport yachting crowd was when the winning skipper , John Bertrand , taunted during the races that the next Cup competition would be sailed out of the mostly working-class port of Fremantle in the sun- drenched Indian Ocean . " It 's absolutely glorious , " he told anybody who cared to listen . " It is probably the most perfect 12-meter sailing ground in the world . " <P> Right , mate . <P> Having traveled halfway around the globe to race on Bertrand 's home turf , the better part of the world sailing establishment is now prepared to dispute his claim . For seven days ending last week , 14 brightly colored 12-meter yachts , representing eleven America 's Cup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Western Australia in a pre-Cup sparring match called the 12-Meter World Championship . When the last sails were furled , the visitors had taken a belting , both from the sea and from the home team . A 20- knot wind , known locally as the Fremantle Doctor , frequently frosted the 6- ft. ocean swells with a 3-ft. chop described by one Australian sailor as " dirty and short . " In all the rough slogging , the assembled regatta lost four 90-ft. masts , a dozen booms and hundreds of square yards of Kevlar sailcloth . In the turmoil , five crewmen were washed overboard and had to be saved . Gary Jobson , of the Chicago-based Heart of America syndicate , declared the roiled-up waters off Fremantle " unsuitable for racing . " <P> The seas did not seem to bother the Cup 's defenders , however . When the breezes were lightest , in the fourth race , the winning boat was Australia II , the winged-keel victor at Newport . When the Doctor was in , the honors went to Australia III , a boat specifically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who also designed Australia II ) . Skippered by Colin Beashel , Australia III finished ahead of the pack in three of the first six races , building such a lead that the championship was won even before it was over . For the seventh and final race , the Australian tacticians were content to assess their competitors from the comfort of dry dock . <P> The biggest surprise came from New Zealand , which entered two innovative boats built not of wood or aluminum like traditional twelves but of fiber glass , prompting an instant nickname : plastic fantastics . One of the pair , the New Zealand II , performed remarkably , coming almost directly from the boat shed to finish second in the series . An entry sponsored by the French photo processing company Kis also broke new ground of a sort , winning special permission from rule-makers to hoist a spinnaker emblazoned with its lead entry 's racy name : French Kiss . She came in fifth .                    @
