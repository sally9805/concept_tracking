Emergency relief arrives , but the starving continue to pour in <P> The round hut , made of roughhewn wood posts and a conical thatched roof , is known as zawya . In the Afar language , that means the house of the dead . Although it is not long after dawn , 26 bodies have already been wrapped in filthy burlap shrouds on the earthen floor . The air is sickly sweet with the smell of decay . Inside , in accordance with Muslim custom , Hussein Yussuf is tenderly washing the shriveled body of a three-year-old boy . " This is the first water this child has had for a long , long time , " says the 60-year-old man . In the past four weeks , Yussuf , known as Jenaza-atabi ( Cleaner of the dead ) , has washed 400 bodies , and , he says , " the numbers keep going up . " After he has finished his sad task , Yussuf lifts up the wasted corpse and lays it on a bed of fresh eucalyptus leaves . Then Sheik Ali Hassan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> All around the house of the dead , in a refugee camp in the small northern Ethiopian town of Bati , more than 25,000 starving people huddled together last week . Some 210 miles away there was a similar scene of destitution around the 9,000 famished people who crowded into the Quiha camp . Shrouded in a pall of woodsmoke , their new home looked like a medieval battlefield . The parched , scabrous earth was pockmarked with foxholes in which hundreds upon hundreds of families crouched for shelter against the chill mountain wind . The lucky ones had a branch to cover their dugout ; others remained exposed to the elements . As soon as a foreign visitor appeared , the emaciated people took him for a doctor , crowded around and clutched at his trousers and clung to his legs , pleading for help . Half crazy for food , they trampled each other and knocked down their flimsy shelters in their rush to get to the foreigner . <P> The wind whipped across the dry , brown plains , and a man , naked in his hole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did an old woman covered with flies . A man named Abigurney , who had already lost three children , was asked how many had died in his village . " Too many for me to count , " he replied . <P> There are too many to count . At Bati and Quiha and more than 100 other refugee camps in Ethiopia run by international organizations like the Red Cross , famine relief has begun to pour in . But throughout the country , at least 6 million people live at the brink of starvation . Relief workers expect that almost a million Ethiopians may die this year alone in what could become " the worst human disaster in recent history . " After ten years of drought and civil war , twelve of the country 's 14 provinces have been laid waste by a famine of biblical proportions . More than 40% of the country 's 42 million people are malnourished , and 2.2 million have left their homes to wander in search of food .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
