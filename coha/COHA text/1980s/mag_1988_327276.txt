She still limps . Despite plastic surgery , her nose is crushed and her upper lip is permanently split . But when she testified last week in a Manhattan courtroom against her former live-in lover , who is accused of beating to death their illegally adopted six-year-old daughter , Hedda Nussbaum spoke in a firm , clear voice . What emerged was a bizarre tale of violence , drug abuse , isolation and mind control inflicted by disbarred lawyer Joel Steinberg . Asked why she never escaped from Steinberg 's thrall , Nussbaum had a simple reply : " I worshiped him . " <P> Fighting back tears , the former editor of children 's books recalled how Steinberg had first wooed her by promising to teach her about life . The lessons , she testified , soon turned to assaults so severe that she lost her spleen , several teeth and partial hearing in one ear . Her eye was damaged , her nose broken , and one knee hobbled . Six times , Nussbaum claimed , she tried to run away , but she always returned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without him . " After one pummeling in 1984 , she fled to a shelter for battered women and was sent to Bellevue Hospital . When doctors questioned Nussbaum , she said she belonged to a sadomasochistic cult . " Joel put the story in my mind , " she testified , adding that he " would encourage me to come up with stories , fantasies about what happened . Since I had no actual memories of this myself , I believed I had some sort of amnesia about it . " <P> According to Nussbaum , Steinberg , 47 , assumed such total control of her life that she could not eat or leave their Greenwich Village apartment without his permission . One night last November , she said , he ordered her and Lisa to eat hot pepper , forcing them to drink glass after glass of tap water . A bit later , while Nussbaum was in the bathroom , Steinberg came in bearing in his arms the bruised and unconscious girl . When Nussbaum asked what had happened , she testified , Steinberg replied , " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Has n't this gone far enough ? " He then ordered her to flush the toilet . <P> After he left the apartment , Nussbaum tried several times to waken Lisa , but abandoned the effort because she thought Steinberg could use supernatural healing powers to revive Lisa when he returned . Instead , says Nussbaum , he insisted the couple share some free-base cocaine before calling for help . Nussbaum testified that Steinberg admitted , " I knocked her down , and she did n't want to get up again . " Nussbaum suggested a motive for the brutal beating : Steinberg believed Lisa and the couple 's other illegally adopted child , Mitchell , then 16 months old , were hypnotizing him with their stares . <P> In order to testify , Nussbaum , 46 , was forced to come to terms with the horror of her ordeal . Originally police charged her , along with Steinberg , with second-degree murder . Prosecutors dropped the charge after becoming convinced she had been so battered psychologically and physically that she could not have participated in beating Lisa . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the prosecution . On the eve of her testimony , Nussbaum made what her psychiatrist calls a " final declaration of independence " by slapping Steinberg with a $3 million lawsuit for the decade of abuse she allegedly suffered at his hands .
