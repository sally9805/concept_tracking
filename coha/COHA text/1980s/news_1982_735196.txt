txt American Motors Corp . directors reshuffled the company 's top management , naming a new three-man team to run the troubled auto maker under its affiliation with Regie Nationale des Usines Renault , the French car company . As part of the surprise move . Gerald C. Meyers agreed to step down as chairman and chief executive officer at the age of 53 . Company sources said that Mr. Meyers , who only a year ago signed a four-year contract . decided to leave rather than accept a limited role . He will remain a director . W. Paul Tippett Jr .. 49 , was named to succeed Mr. Meyers . Mr. Tippett 's post as president and chief operating officer will be taken over by Jose J. Dedeurwaerder , 48. former executive vice president of manufacturing . The third member of the new management team is Roy D. Chapin Jr. , a widely respected industrialist who preceded Mr. Meyers as chairman from 1967 to 1978 . The board named Mr. Chapin , 66 , to head a newly formed executive committee . The committee 's two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ management changes at AMC come at a time when the company is struggling to make its partnership with Renault succeed . Threatened with extinction in a declining U.S. auto market , AMC last year completed an agreement with the French auto maker that gave AMC $350 million and Renault ** of the U.S. company 's stock . Though hailed as revolutionary by both sides , the arrangement has n't been sufficient to keep AMC out of financial straits . In November , faced with a cash shortage , AMC made a still-pending request for a $150 million loan from its blue-collar employes . Even more recently , it was forced to renegotiate provisions of a $250 million bank credit to stay out of default . AMC officials , however , asserted that the company 's financial troubles were n't a factor in the board 's decision to name new management . They also were quick to say Renault was n't behind the move . But the executives gave only vague responses when asked for an explanation . " It was time to let the tigers go to work . " Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more specific , except to say that he intends to pursue other interests . He would n't disclose his plans . " The board suggested we have a new look at management . " said Mr. Tippett . But when asked if that meant that Mr. Meyers had been asked to resign , he said : - No , no , it was nothing like that . " Company sources , however , said that AMC 's 16-member board decided to give more responsibility to Mr. Tippett , a marketing expert who has worked for Ford Motor Co. and Procter &; Gamble Co. , and to Mr. Dedeurwaerder , whose expertise is in manufacturing . Mr. Dedeurwaerder joined AMC last October from Renault , where he supervised the production start-up of a small car . The car will be built in the U.S. by AMC beginning this summer . " Marketing and manufacturing are the two areas that this company needs the most help in , " said an AMC executive . " That makes Tippett and Dedeurwaerder the men of the hour . " Mr. Meyers ' background , by contrast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his biggest accomplishments at the company are product related , such as the introduction of the Gremlin in 1971 . But under AMC 's arrangement with Renault , many of those activities are being handled by the French company . Faced with having some of his responsibilities transferred to the two other executives , Mr. Meyers apparently chose to leave the company . " Gerry is the kind of guy who likes to put in a 16-hour day , " said one executive . " I 'm not sure he would have had that type of job if he stayed on . " Mr. Chapin 's new role in the company will be to fill gaps created by the departure of Mr. Meyers , who said " Roy will be able to help maintain continuity and be a spokesman for the company . " Mr. Chapin is from an auto family . His father helped establish Hudson Motor Car Co. , which merged with Nash-Kelvinator Corp . in 1954 to form AMC . Mr. Chapin sought to play down his new job , saying : " I wo n't be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But there are indications that he will play a substantial role . According to Mr. Tippett , the new executive committee will " be able to act quickly on behalf of the board in policy matters . " Despite denials by the company , rumors quickly spread throughout AMC that Mr. Meyers was fired by Renault . On Saturday , Mr. Tippett called AMC executives to a meeting to deny the rumor and to explain the board 's decision . Mr. Meyers will continue to be paid $385,000 annually under his four-year contract . He said one of two reasons for the contract was to show AMC employes that his job was secure in the wake of the arrangement with Renault . The other , he said , was for financial support " if something like this happened . "
