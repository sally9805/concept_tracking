At an age when most executives are thinking of retirement , Robert Costello , 61 , has just accepted the challenge of a lifetime . He is the new Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition , the chief buyer for what amounts to the largest business enterprise in the world . Every day the 170,000 Pentagon employees who report to him sign some 56,000 contracts with private firms ranging from industrial giants like General Dynamics , Boeing and General Electric to tiny subcontractors . As the Pentagon 's procurement czar , Costello will buy goods and services worth $170 billion this year . He must also oversee the costs of 2,600 weapons systems , as well as a bewildering variety of research and development projects . " Make no mistake , " says Costello 's boss , Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci , " Bob is undertaking one of the most demanding assignments in the department . " <P> The sheer size of the job is enough , but Costello , a former General Motors executive , also faces the task of restoring efficiency and respectability to an operation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ criticism from Congress and the press . The stakes are enormous : unless Costello spends the Pentagon 's money wisely , the Soviet Union will overtake the U.S. in the military technology race . Admiral Kinnaird McKee , director of Naval Nuclear Propulsion , has warned that Soviet submarine technology " is rapidly catching up with that in the West . " <P> While Costello 's task is to keep the U.S. ahead , he must do so at a time of serious concern about the federal deficit and severe budget constraints . Carlucci , who last November succeeded Caspar Weinberger , the freest-spending Defense Secretary in U.S. history ( $2.4 trillion in just under eight years ) , has ordered that planned Pentagon outlays in the fiscal 1989 budget now being prepared must be cut by $33 billion , or 10% . <P> Congress created Costello 's post in 1986 following disclosures of huge cost overruns by defense contractors and allegations that companies had , among many other offenses , billed the Pentagon for their executives ' country-club fees and charged as much as $7,500 for a coffeepot used in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be to centralize all procurement authority in the hands of a single individual . Until then , such power had been spread among a myriad of departments . Said Congresswoman Patricia Schroeder , a Colorado Democrat : " We envisioned a czar who would kick trash cans and have rats jump out . "
