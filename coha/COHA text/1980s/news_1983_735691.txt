txt Europe 's most durable leader came to power when Franklin Delano Roosevelt and Winston Churchill were still on the world scene and when his hero , Joseph Stalin . still ruled in the Soviet Union . He has survived Charles de Gaulle . Fiancisco Franco and Marshal Tito , and at the age of 74 he has entered a god-like twilight among his people . He is Enver Hoxha ( pronounced HODJail ) , first secretary of the Albanian Workers ' Party since its founding in 1941 and leader of Albania since the Communists seized power there in 1944 . He has held on to office ever since by sending a good number of his fellow party bosses to the firing squad and by keeping his countrymen convinced of his omnipotence . Here in Tirana , Albania 's quiet and orderly capital city , the extent of Mr Hoxha 's grip on this tiny country of 2 ? ' 4 million people is evident . Two huge bronze statues of him dominate the National Museum . one showing him as the wise leader , the other as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the other hand on his holster . Quotations from his voluminous writings are strung across buildings . And throughout the city , as indeed throughout the country , this slogan appears with the repetitive hammering of a detergent commercial : " Rrofte Shoku Enver Hoxha " ? Glory to Comrade Enver Hoxha " He is both god and monarch with the medie ? at trappings of powel , ? ? observes one Western diplomat with long rience in Albania Ceti a mly maintains a god-like distance from his people Despite the many photographs that show him chatting with ordinary folk , he is something of a recluse , making public appearances . He lives , it 's thought , in the center of Tirana in a modem , Spanish-style villa standing ; in the elegant grounds of a large compound that Includes the homes of other top party and government officials . The compound is patrolled by armed troops and by plainclothes police who prevent pedestrians from coming too close and wave on those who dare to stand and stare . Leader Told to ' Relax ' Last year , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Mi Hoxha that he had been ordered by his party colleagues to " relax . " This has given rise to speculation that his health is failing and that his long " reign " may be coming to an end . That would shake many Albanians because Mr. Hoxha has become synonymous with the Communist Party . One of the most ubiquitous of slogans attests to this with the words " Parti Enver " ? Enver 's Patty . The slogan can be seen carved on cliff walls and laid out on hillsides in large white stones Yet an Albanian tour guide is adamant that Mr. Hoxha has n't been deified in the style of Mao Tse-tung . " Where are the badges ' ? " she asks . " Where are the little red hooks ? ' Well , no , there are no badges  --  but there are huge pictures of Enver Hoxha. staring Big Brother-fashion from many buildings in the country . And , no. there are no little red books  --  but there are 37 volumes of the memoirs of Enver Hoxha on sale in bookshops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being produced at the rate of about one a year . that the world gets its best insights into the mind of Enver Hoxha , described by some diplomats as " a fanatical nationalist , " by others as a " puritanical ideologue . " Purges and Paranoia ? Such criticisms stem partly from Mr. Hoxha 's alleged mistreatment of his compatriots who helped him take control of Albania after World War H. Mr. Hoxha 's purges have meant that many of his former associates have been sent before firing squads or to Albanian labor camps . Just two of those camps . Amnesty International estimates , hold nearly 3.000 political prisoners . For the longest time , the one man who seemed immune to the purges was Prime Minister Mehmet Shehu , Mr Hoxha 's closest ally for 40 years . But in December 1981 , the government suddenly announced that Mr. Shehu had killed himself . And last year Mr. Hoxha wrote in his latest volume of memoirs that his forme/ right-hand man had been an international spy who for years had been under orders to assassinate him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hoxha have been getting stranger and stranger , with much talk of " internal enemies " and an " invasion " of Albania 's Adriatic coast by a " terrorist band , " which Mr. Hoxha claims he needs " no more than five hours to discover and wipe out . " To sonic Western diplomats , all of this looks suspiciously like an excuse for " clan warfare , " because a number of Shehu associates have disappeared , including his wife , his nephew and his brother-in-law , all top party officials . The latest victim of the purge appears to be the foreign minister , Nest ' Nase . The only person Mr. Hoxha appears to have truly admired is Joseph Stalin . for whom he has a pandering respect . He apparently met Stalin five times , and around these meetings he has constructed a volume of memoirs , impressively titled With Stalin . The cover shows a youthful Hoxha standing next to the great man , and the text goes into such banal details of conversation ( " After we rose from the table , Stalin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coat " ) that the reader must assume that the author followed Stalin around with a notebook . With Mr. Shehu gone . Mr. Hoxha now rules alone . Some Western analysts believe that Albania is facing deep economic and political crises . But despite the evidence of dissension within the party , they say , he will probably manage to stay in power until his death . One reason is that the party elite is thought to be a strictly disciplined group , very middle class and largely free of the corruption that bedevils most communist states . In fact about the only two luxuries allowed the party faithful are automobiles ( banned for everyone else ) and access to Western television . Every day , Italian television news is piped into Albania over a closed circuit The screen goes blank only when the news shows the pope ( Albania bans all religions ) , Western luxuries and anything of a sexual nature . Every evening , it 's said , all party meetings stop , and even Mr. Hoxha puts down his work on his 38th volume of memoirs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
