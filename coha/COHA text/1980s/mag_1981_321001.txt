More and more practitioners find that it pays to make a pitch <P> No one raised an eyebrow back in 1838 , when Springfield , Ill. , Lawyer Abraham Lincoln 's name appeared in a newspaper ad . By the early 1900s , however , most states had outlawed attorney advertising because it was considered unnecessary and , worse , unseemly . Then , in 1976 , two young Phoenix lawyers took out a one column ad offering " legal services at very reasonable fees " and listed six examples . The pair were censured by the Arizona Supreme Court . A year later they won vindication : a U.S. Supreme Court ruling that the First Amendment bars prohibition of lawyer advertising , unless , for example , it is " false , deceptive or misleading . " <P> Since that decision , only one in ten of the nation 's lawyers has ventured into advertising . Many still fear that they will be stigmatized . Furthermore , in setting guidelines , many states have retained substantial barriers . Ten states bar slogans , twelve prohibit ads on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do you need a lawyer ? " Many of these restrictions may not survive much longer , though . In its next term the high court will decide whether Missouri is entitled to discipline a lawyer whose Yellow Pages ad identified one of his specialties as " personal injury " rather than " negligence , " the state-approved word . In the process , the Justices could wipe out almost all such impediments . <P> Most attorneys who have tried advertising have stuck to newspapers and phone books , typically running so-called tombstone ads that specify their specialties and prices . A survey by the Los Angeles Times , however , found that 42% of such ads in its editions drew no responses . <P> Television has proved far more effective . In Denver , the Legal Clinic of Sarney , Trattler &; Waitkus credits four slick 30-second TV spots for a 35% boost in business . Says Partner Saul Sarney : " We 're reaching a whole group of people who did n't know what their rights were and felt intimidated by lawyers . " In one bankruptcy ad , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home and a voice intones : " When financial tragedy strikes , you do n't have to lose everything ... There are laws to protect you . " <P> Sometimes ads can succeed beyond a lawyer 's wildest dreams . Madison , Wis. , Attorney Ken Hur , founder of a low-cost legal clinic , pushed its services with a variety of novel pitches that he says made him " the advertisingest lawyer in America . " A hearse , for example , began to rumble along local streets with a printed message promoting $15 wills . Before long , Hur left the clinic and boosted his own hourly charge to $100 . He explains , " I had to raise my rates to drive away business . " <P> Another advertising option is direct mail , which enables the sender to pinpoint his audience . Islip , N.Y. , Lawyers William Harrison and Alfred Koffler were dissatisfied with their newspaper-ad campaign offering house closings for $235 , so they reduced their rate another $40 and sent out letters to 7,500 homeowners . The result : 200 clients and disciplinary proceedings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's highest court backed the pair and ruled that direct mail was allowed , 38 states still prohibit it .
