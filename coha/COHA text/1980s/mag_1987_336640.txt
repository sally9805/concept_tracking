Donald Trump could not resist crowing . The flamboyant Manhattan real estate developer confided to journalists last week that he had foreseen the end of the long bull market in August , when the Dow Jones industrial average neared its peak of 2722 . Trump , 41 , had accordingly cashed in the bulk of his stock holdings , some $500 million worth of shares in Allegis , Holiday Inns , Bally Recreation and other companies . As Black Monday loomed for less fortunate investors , the tycoon claimed he had made a net profit of some $200 million . Now , Trump declared , he intended to " stay in cash for a while , see where the world is going . " <P> Tony Cafazza , 46 , owner of a St. Louis company that sells and services cash registers , rang up profits even as the crash began . Cafazza had sold his stock holdings during the previous three months , for a profit of $100,000 . Then , in September , he bought so-called puts on General Motors  --  options to sell the company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On the Friday before Black Monday , as GM stock nose-dived 4 7/8 points to close at 66 , Cafazza cashed in his options , which soared in value because their set purchase price was higher than the worth of the slumping GM shares . In the process , he made an additional $41,000 . <P> Trump and Cafazza were among the thousands of U.S. investors , big and small , who beat the odds and emerged as winners in the midst of the stock market 's bloodletting . Some of those players , like Trump , had sensed the big drop coming and took their profits before that climactic moment . Others , like Cafazza , in effect bet on the market plunge by making investments that rise in value when stock prices crumble  --  either through options trading or a practice known as short selling . Yet another group of investors swooped aggressively into bargain-basement stock buying on Tuesday , after the Dow took its 508-point plunge , on the hunch that the market was certain to rebound . All of them proved that even on the worst of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> Some of the success stories were monumental . British Corporate Raider Sir James Goldsmith , 54 , got out of the market well in advance of calamity . In late August he sold his 29% share of Occidentale Generale , a $1.55 billion Paris-based holding company that controls , among other things , the Grand Union supermarket chain , French publishing interests and vast stretches of Northeast U.S. timberland . Goldsmith 's profit : $450 million . Having fled the market , Goldsmith declared , " I am a spectator , and will remain a spectator for the time being . " An important factor that prompted Goldsmith to bail out of the market was the stubborn U.S. trade deficit , which , he had assumed , would eventually cause interest rates to rise and stock prices to fall . Said he : " This is exactly what has happened . " <P> Ven Parameswaran , 57 , president of First Asian Securities , a tiny New York City brokerage , earned a $13,750 profit last Monday using the same method as Cafazza : put options . Parameswaran made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Santa Clara , Calif. , electronics company , which zoomed in value from 25 cents to $3 a share as the stock price of the firm tumbled 2 1/4 points on Monday , closing at 15 . " I could have waited and got $4.25 per share for the options , " Parameswaran said , " but I was not greedy . "
