Washington drops some costly and questionable auto rules <P> During the past 15 years , the American automobile has been designed almost as much by Washington bureaucrats as by Detroit automakers . In order to comply with federal safety and consumer-protection regulations , cars took on a variety of new features that included anti-whiplash headrests , impact-resistant bumpers , and safety belts that set off an irritating buzz until everyone in front had buckled up . <P> The endless flood of new auto regulations may have ended last week , when the Reagan Administration announced the rollback of a series of rules governing cars . The White House proclaimed that the Government will eliminate a total of 34 air-quality and safety regulations that it does not consider cost-efficient . It estimated that these changes will save automakers $1.3 billion and consumers $8 billion over the next five years . Explained Vice President George Bush : " Our thesis on regulation is that it 's gone too far . " <P> The Administration measures did not in any way constitute a repeal of the major safety and clean-air standards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and questionable bureaucratic rulemaking . For example , the introduction of airbags or automatic seat belts , which was to have been started with some 1982 full-size models , has been put off for at least a year . The requirement to equip cars with dashboard gauges that tell drivers when their tires are underinflated was eliminated . The Reagan Administration also modified the regulation requiring bumpers to withstand crashes at speeds of up to 5 m.p.h. without a dent . <P> Another casualty : fuel-efficiency standards to take effect after 1985 . Because of consumer demand for smaller cars , Detroit is already far ahead of the Government-mandated fuel-economy standards that require each automaker 's fleet of cars to reach an average of 27.5 m.p.g. by 1985 . <P> In addition , the White House will ask Congress to amend the Clean Air Act so that cars sold in areas at normal altitude will not have to meet the extra emission standards set for places at high altitude like Denver . That requirement , which would have gone into effect on 1984 models , would increase the cost of every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grain , publisher of Automotive News : " It 's already got to the point where if a guy goes out to his garage , closes the door and turns on the engine to commit suicide , all he does is come out four hours later feeling much better . " <P> Detroit executives were obviously pleased with the Reagan decisions . General Motors Chairman Roger Smith called them " a sensible step toward making regulation more cost-effective . " Added James W. McLernon , president of Volkswagen of America : " This is a giant step toward restoring the long-term health of the American automotive industry . " But Ralph Nader , the father of many of the auto rules , protested bitterly . Said he : " These regulation rollbacks are going to kill a lot of people and ruin the health and environment for others . "
