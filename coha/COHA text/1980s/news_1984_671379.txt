// From the Opinion // By Justice Stevens // The University of Oklahoma and the University of Georgia contend that the National Collegiate Athletic Association has unreasonably restrained trade in the televising of college football games . After an extended trial , the District Court found that the NCAA had violated Sec. 1 of the Sherman Act and granted injunctive relief . The Court of Appeals agreed that the statute had been violated but modified the remedy in some respects . We granted certiorari , and now affirm. // // **26;1106; The plan adopted in 1981 for the 1982-1985 seasons is at issue in this case . This plan , like each of its predecessors , recites that it is intended to reduce , insofar as possible , the adverse affects of live television upon football game attendance. <> // In separate agreements with each of the carrying networks , ABC and CBS , the NCAA granted each the right to telecast the 14 live " exposures " described in the plan , in accordance with the " ground rules " set forth therein . Each of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the participating NCAA member institutions " during the 4-year period in an amount that totaled $131 , 750 , 000 . In essence the agreement authorized each network to negotiate directly with member schools for the right to televise their games . <> <> Television Appearances // // Under the appearance limitations no member institution is eligible to appear on television more than a total of six times and more than four times nationally , with the appearances to be divided equally between the two carrying networks. // No member is permitted to make any sale of television rights except in accordance with the basic plan. // The District Court found that competition in the relevant market had been restrained in three ways : ( 1 ) NCAA fixed the price for particular telecasts ; ( 2 ) its exclusive network contracts were tantamount to a group boycott of all other potential broadcasters and its threat of sanctions against its own members constituted a threatened boycott of potential competitors ; and ( 3 ) its plan placed an artificial limit on the production of televised college football. // There can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constitute a " restraint of trade " in the sense that they limit members ' freedom to negotiate and enter into their own television contracts . In that sense , however , every contract is a restraint of trade , and as we have repeatedly recognized , the Sherman Act was intended to prohibit only unreasonable restraints of trade . <> <> Restraints at Issue // // It is also undeniable that these practices share characteristics of restraints we have previously held unreasonable . The NCAA is an association of schools which compete against each other to attract television revenues , not to mention fans and athletes . As the District Court found , the policies of the NCAA with respect to television rights are ultimately controlled by the vote of member institutions . By participating in an association which prevents member institutions from competing against each other on the basis of price or kind of television rights that can be offered to broadcasters , the NCAA member institutions have created a horizontal restraint - an agreement among competitors on the way in which they will compete with one another . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be unreasonable as a matter of law . Because it places a ceiling on the number of games member institutions may televise , the horizontal agreement places an artificial limit on the quantity of televised football that is available to broadcasters and consumers . By restraining the quantity of television rights available for sale , the challenged practices create a limitation on output ; our cases have held that such limitations are unreasonable restraints of trade . Moreover , the District Court found that the minimum aggregate price in fact operates to preclude any price negotiation between broadcasters and institutions , thereby constituting horizontal price fixing , perhaps the paradigm of an unreasonable restraint of trade . <> <> ' Significant Potential ' // Because it restrains price and output , the NCAA ' s television plan has a significant potential for anticompetitive effects . The findings of the District Court indicate that this potential has been realized . The District Court found that if member institutions were free to sell television rights , many more games would be shown on television , and that the NCAA ' s output restriction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for television rights . Moreover , the court found that by fixing a price for television rights to all games , the NCAA creates a price structure that is unresponsive to viewer demand and unrelated to the prices that would prevail in a competitive market . And , of course , since as a practical matter all member institutions need NCAA approval , members have no real choice but to adhere to the NCAA ' s television controls. // The anticompetitive consequences of this arrangement are apparent . Individual competitors lose their freedom to compete . Price is higher and output lower than they would otherwise be , and both are unresponsive to consumer preference . This latter point is perhaps the most significant , since Congress designed the Sherman Act as a consumer welfare prescription . A restraint that has the effect of reducing the importance of consumer preference in setting price and output is not consistent with this fundamental goal of antitrust law . Restrictions on price and output are the paradigmatic examples of restraints of trade that the Sherman Act was intended to prohibit . At the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , since only those broadcasters able to bid on television rights covering the entire NCAA can compete . Thus , as the District Court found , many telecasts that would occur in a competitive market are foreclosed by the NCAA ' s plan . <> <> Question of Market Power // // Petitioner argues , however , that its television plan can have no significant anticompetitive effect since the record indicates that it has no market power - no ability to alter the interaction of supply and demand in the market . We must reject this argument. // As a factual matter , it is evident that petitioner does possess market power. // The District Court did not find that the NCAA ' s television plan produced any procompetitive efficiencies which enhanced the competitiveness of college football television rights ; to the contrary , it concluded that NCAA football could be marketed just as effectively without the television plan . There is therefore no predicate in the findings for petitioner ' s efficiency justification . Indeed , petitioner ' s argument is refuted by the District Court ' s finding concerning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan produced procompetitive efficiencies , the plan would increase output and reduce the price of televised games . The District Court ' s contrary findings accordingly undermine petitioner ' s position. // The NCAA ' s argument that its television plan is necessary to protect live attendance is not based on a desire to maintain the integrity of college football as a distinct and attractive produce , but rather on a fear that the product will not prove sufficiently attractive to draw live attendance when faced with competition from televised games . At bottom the NCAA ' s position is that ticket sales for most college games are unable to compete in a free market . The television plan protects ticket sales by limiting output - just as any monopolist increases revenues by reducing output . By seeking to insulate live ticket sales from the full spectrum of competition because of its assumption that the product itself is insufficiently attractive to consumers , petitioner forwards a justification that is inconsistent with the basic policy of the Sherman Act . <> <> Role of Amateurism // // The NCAA plays a critical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in college sports . There can be no question but that it needs ample latitude to play that role , or that the preservaton of the student- athlete in higher education adds richness and diversity to intercollegiate athletics and is entirely consistent with the goals of the Sherman Act . But consistent with the Sherman Act , the role of the NCAA must be to **28;1134; preserve <> a tradition that might otherwise die ; rules that restrict output are hardly consistent with this role . Today we hold only that the record supports the District Court ' s conclusion that by curtailing output and blunting the ability of member institutions to respond to consumer preference , the NCAA has restricted rather than enhanced the place of intercollegiate athletics in the Nation ' s <> <> life . Accordingly , the judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed. // // From Dissenting Opinion // By Justice White // The NCAA is an unincorporated , nonprofit , educational association whose membership includes almost 800 nonprofit public and private colleges and universities and more than 100 nonprofit athletic conferences and other organizations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concerning abuses in intercollegiate athletics , the NCAA , through its annual convention , establishes policies and rules governing its members ' participation in college sports , conducts national championships , exerts control over some of the economic aspects of revenue-producing sports , and engages in some more-or-less commercial activities . Although some of the NCAA ' s activities , viewed in isolation , bear a resemblance to those undertaken by professional sports leagues and associations , the Court errs in treating intercollegiate athletics under the NCAA ' s control as a purely commercial venture in which colleges and universities particiate solely , or even primarily , in the pursuit of profits . Accordingly , I dissent. // The NCAA ' s member institutions have designed their competitive athletic programs " to be a vital part of the educational system . " Deviations from this goal , produced by a persistent and perhaps inevitable desire to " win at all costs , " have in the past led , and continue to lead , to a wide range of competitive excesses that prove harmful to students and institutions alike . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to provide a public good - a viable system of amateur athletics - that most likely could not be provided in a perfectly competitive market. // In pursuit of its fundamental goal and others related to it , the NCAA imposes numerous controls on intercollegiate athletic competition among its members , many of which are similar to those which are summarily condemned when undertaken in a more traditional business setting . Thus , the NCAA has promulgated and enforced rules limiting both the compensation of student-athletes , and the number of coaches a school may hire for its football and basketball programs ; it also has prohibited athletes who formerly have been compensated for playing from participating in intercollegiate competition , restricted the number of athletic scholarships its members may award , and established minimum academic standards for recipients of those scholarships ; and it has pervasively regulated the recruitment process , student eligibility , practice schedules , squad size , the number of games played , and many other aspects of intercollegiate athletics . One clear effect of most , if not all , of these regulations is to prevent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their success by expanding their programs , improving the quality of the product they offer , and increasing their sports revenues . Yet each of these regulations represents a desirable and legitimate attempt to keep university athletics from becoming professionalized to the extent that profitmaking objectives would overshadow educational objectives. // I do not believe that the restraint under consideration in this case - the NCAA ' s television plan - differs fundamentally for antitrust purposes from the other seemingly anticompetitive aspects of the organization ' s broader program of self-regulation. // //
