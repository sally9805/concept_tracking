Reporters raid Camp Lejeune <P> The plan of attack well rehearsed and thorough . Leaving a fishing cabin rented under a false name , the group of eight split into three teams ; two of them rode in vans loaded with unmarked cardboard cartons while the third left in a 17-ft. outboard motorboat . The van teams entered the huge U.S. Marine base at Camp Lejeune , N.C. , through different gates and joined forces at the PX parking lot . They stopped briefly at Second Division headquarters , then drove to an on-base junior high school , where hundreds of unsuspecting students were attending classes . The boat team , meanwhile , sneaked undetected onto the base on the New River and , according to plan , faked engine trouble along " Generals ' Row , " the cluster of riverside houses occupied by the camp 's commanding officers and their families . <P> Another bloody terrorist attack ? Fortunately , no-only an elaborate hoax to demonstrate that just such an assault would be almost invitingly possible at Lejeune , home base of the Marine unit currently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story published last week by the Wilmington ( N.C. ) Morning Star , the paper identified the " attackers " as a team of its own reporters and photographers , plus a couple of friends . The " weapons " carried in the boxes were not bombs and guns but prewritten notes designed to point up lax security . At Second Division headquarters , for example , one of the van teams taped up a note in a rest room a short distance away from the office of the division commander , Major General Alfred Gray . " If this had been a bomb , it could have blown up this building , " the note read . " Think about it . " <P> The ruse was the idea of Star Managing Editor William Coughlin , 61 , a former Los Angeles Times Beirut bureau chief . After the Oct. 23 truck-bomb attack on <P> Marine headquarters in Beirut , Coughlin became increasingly convinced that authorities at Lejeune were seriously underestimating the camp 's vulnerability to terrorism . " Our concern was that there was no evidence of any change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> " The Marines were still thinking like Marines , not like terrorists . " Critics of the newspaper 's ersatz raid said it was inappropriate because Lejeune is merely a training facility with no strategic value to an enemy . It was not necessary for the entire base to be totally sealed . <P> Camp authorities contended that they gained advance intelligence about the phony attack from the FBI and other law enforcement agencies , a claim that is hotly disputed by Coughlin &; Co . In any case , insisted Base Commander Major General Donald J. Fulham , there is no way to secure completely a 110,000-acre facility that is home to 40,000 servicemen and their families . Keeping the base relatively open , he said , was important to both the Marines and the surrounding community . To do otherwise would be " disrupting the American way of life . " <P> Nonetheless , on the day following the Star 's story , sentries began searching all trucks and vans at the camp 's gates . Said a satisfied Coughlin of his ploy : " Apparently it worked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
