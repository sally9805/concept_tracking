In its quest for ways to reduce the U.S. trade deficit , the Reagan Administration has repeatedly urged other countries to grow faster and absorb more American imports . One of the prime targets of the jawboning has been Western Europe , which last year ran up a $26.4 billion trade surplus with the U.S. But if the White House is counting on much help from the Europeans this year , it is likely to be disappointed . That was the consensus of TIME 's European Board of Economists , which met in London for its semiannual review of Europe 's outlook . Average growth in the gross national products of the major West European nations will be a solid but unspectacular 3% in 1987 , predicted Switzerland 's Hans Mast , senior economic adviser to the Credit Suisse First Boston investment bank . The expected growth rate will be up slightly from 2.5% in 1986  --  not the kind of acceleration Washington has in mind . <P> Even that moderate growth is by no means assured . To an uncomfortable ! extent , the expansion is dependent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of growth is threatened by the decline in the value of the dollar , which makes European products much more expensive in the U.S. So far , such premier exporters as West Germany and France have weathered the dollar 's fall , but a further steep drop could be devastating . <P> The only way for European countries to insulate themselves against that peril , TIME 's economists agreed , is to boost domestic demand and become less reliant on exports . The onus will be on West Germany , Europe 's most powerful economy , to take the initiative . Last year the Germans resisted pressure to cut interest rates and lift demand by promising that strong growth was already in the pipeline . Further stimulus , German officials argued , would raise the risk of an overheated economy and renewed inflation . But West Germany 's 2.75% growth rate in 1986 fell short of expectations as the high-flying mark and falling sales to oil-producing countries undermined export earnings . <P> Last month 's decision by West Germany 's central bank to trim the discount rate that it charges to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed step to take pressure off the mark and boost domestic German consumption . Some of TIME 's economists , though , argued that a further relaxation of West German monetary policy is still needed . " The Bundesbank 's action was too late and not sufficient , " complained Mast . <P> But it is not at all certain that European governments can quickly generate a sharp rise in domestic consumption merely by pouring more money into their economies . A portion of industrial capacity must be redirected from manufacturing products for export to satisfying local demands , and that takes time . Warned Board Member Guido Carli , former governor of the Bank of Italy : " I have doubts that in the short term it is possible to restructure the economies of countries like Germany and Italy , which for so many years have been export oriented . " <P> Until such restructuring takes place , Europe is unlikely to make substantial progress against its chronic unemployment problem . Though some countries will show a slight improvement this year , the overall European jobless rate could remain stuck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bleak because manufacturers are continuing to trim their work forces as a way of containing costs and boosting productivity .
