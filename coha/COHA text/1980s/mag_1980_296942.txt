Three extortionists lose a $3 million gamble <P> A white van pulled up to the back entrance of Harvey 's Resort Hotel-Casino in Stateline , Nev. , about 5:30 a.m. one day last week . Out climbed two men in white coveralls who unloaded a gray , steel crate , with a small box on top , shrouded in plastic that was stamped IBM . The men carefully made their delivery to the casino 's second-floor executive offices and departed . <P> Casino employees assumed that the containers held a new photocopying machine until someone read a three-page typewritten letter on top that said the big box contained a powerful bomb . The message demanded $3 million and a getaway helicopter in return for instructions on how to disarm the bomb and warned that any attempt to move or tinker with the box would automatically detonate it . The letter was signed : HAPPY LANDING . <P> Police , FBI agents , the Army 's 34th Explosive Ordnance Disposal team and scientists from the Lawrence Livermore Laboratory soon arrived . All day , they gingerly examined the crate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small box with its 28 switches . They X-rayed the big crate and figured that it contained the equivalent of 1,000 sticks of dynamite ; inside the small box was detonating equipment . <P> Just in case the bomb went off , city authorities evacuated 3,000 people from Harvey 's eleven floors and from nearby houses . The windows at Harrah 's , across the street from Harvey 's , were boarded up . But life went on almost normally in Stateline , a community of seven casinos and 1,500 residents that is just a roll of the dice from the California border . Even at Harrah 's , gamblers milled around the roulette wheels and card and dice tables . <P> Casino Owner Harvey Gross , 75 , anted up $3 million in $100 bills and sent it by helicopter early the next morning to a rendezvous point . Once there , the chopper 's pilot received new instructions from the extortionists to head for a strobe light flashing along a highway in northern California . He did so , fruitlessly hovered for half an hour looking for the signal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sheriff Jerry Maple decided that there was no choice but to try to disarm the bomb . Though the Nuclear Regulatory Commission had offered to lend a robot with mechanical claw and television-camera eye , the authorities relied instead on a local firefighter , who attached a small explosive device to the bomb , which was supposed to either destroy the control box or detonate the crate 's contents . At 3:42 p.m. , authorities crossed their fingers and set off the small explosive . <P> Aa instant later , their fingers were in their ears . The bomb exploded with a tremendous blast , sending thick smoke billowing through the street and shooting glass and concrete as far as four blocks away . When the smoke cleared , no one was injured and Harvey 's remained standing , with its first two floors gutted and nearly all of its windows blown out . FBI agents began combing their files for bombmakers in hopes of finding a lead that would take them to the extortionists In demanding $3 million , the gang it turned out , had offered even odds : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that figure .
