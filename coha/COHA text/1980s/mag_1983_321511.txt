The Presidency <P> Presidential greatness has been pondered by amateurs and experts for two centuries . In 1948 Harvard Historian Arthur M. Schlesinger Sr. conducted the first formal survey , asking 55 " experts , " the majority of whom were professional historians , to rate the Presidents . Lincoln , Washington , Franklin Roosevelt , Wilson and Jefferson topped the list in that order . <P> Since then there have been six other reputable surveys , the latest just published by the Journal of American History . Hundreds of questions were sent to 1,997 historians by Robert K. Murray and Tim H. Blessing of Pennsylvania State University . Answers from 846 historians , a good return from this cantankerous breed , arrived in time for the first computer deadline , and the emerging data provided not only a fascinating profile of greatness , or lack of it , but an intriguing look at those who set the rankings . <P> In the new survey , as in the Schlesinger ratings , Lincoln was voted our best President . F.D.R. moved to second place , and Washington fell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who supplanted Wilson in the top four . Rated as near great : Teddy Roosevelt , Wilson , Jackson , Truman . Above average : John Adams , Lyndon Johnson , Eisenhower , Polk , Kennedy , Madison , Monroe , John Quincy Adams , Cleveland . Average : McKinley , Taft , Van Buren , Hoover , Hayes , Arthur , Ford , <P> Carter , Benjamin Harrison . <P> Below average : Taylor , Tyler , Fillmore , Coolidge , Pierce . <P> Failure : Andrew Johnson , Buchanan , Nixon , Grant , Harding . ( William H. Harrison , Garfield and Reagan were not rated because they were not in office long enough for the historians to form judgments . ) <P> Ike and Kennedy edged up from previous ratings . <P> Cleveland , however , who was eighth in the first survey , was down to 17th in the Murray-Blessing rankings . Of contemporary interest was the fact that Ford was graded higher than Carter , and out of the nine Presidents since 1929 , all except Nixon rated average or above . Nixon got some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lowest-rated group . <P> Older historians , it turns out , were more lenient in judging Presidents . Toughest on Hoover , for instance , were those under 40 and easiest were those over 65 , the very children of the Depression so often blamed on Hoover . Women historians ( only 59 were tabulated ) were generally harsher in judging Presidents than the men . For whatever reasons , they were particularly down on Polk and Washington . They rated Carter , L.B.J. , Grant and Kennedy higher than did the men . <P> Northerners were easier on Rutherford B. Hayes than the experts in other regions . The South had a special feeling for the last Whig , Millard Fillmore . The Midwest gave Truman and Ike an edge . In almost every instance , a historian studying a specific President was more sympathetic to him . Military historians downgraded the Naval Academy 's own Jimmy Carter . Afro-American historians rated Jefferson relatively lower ; Western and Frontier historians put him higher .                 @ @ @ @
