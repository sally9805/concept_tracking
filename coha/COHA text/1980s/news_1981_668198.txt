A $75 million package to build a combined arena-exhibition hall and parking garage at North Station , as well as to refurbish the Hynes Auditorium , was recommended yesterday by financial , architectural and legal specialists during a two-and-a-half hour meeting of the Arena Committee . The powerful committee , made up of 27 politicians , businessmen and sports figures , also heard technical specialists project a $350 million annual loss to the state ' s economy if the new complex is not built to fill the void anticipated by the closing of the Boston Garden and relocation of the Boston Bruins hockey team . If the committee ' s proposals are accepted and acted on by the Legislature , the arena could be be built within two years . US Sen. Paul Tsongas , one of four cochairmen of the committee , said , " It ' s no longer a question of what might be done . We know what can be accomplished . It ' s only a matter of fine tuning the proposal now . " Specifically , he said , all that stands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refinement of the major points agreed upon , including specific designs for the North Station site , financing and legal points . " For example , " Tsongas explained , " we asked the bonding experts to come back to us with some worst case ' examples of our financing structure . " He said the committee wanted to prepare for the effects of inflation and the possible rejection of financing devices by the Legislature . Another piece of " fine tuning " would involve the purchase of the Boston Garden from the Delaware North Corporation . Despite repeated attempts by the committee to open negotiations for thepurchase of the Garden , which they estimate should cost from $4 to $6 million , no representatives of Delaware North have responded to their inquiries . Under the plan , conventions would stay at the Hynes Auditorium near the concentration of downtown hotels , while " gate " shows - such as the boat and home shows - would be moved to the North Station exhibition hall . The hall and the new arena would be under one roof to save on heating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone would cost about $30 million . The combined arena- exhibition hall would cost an estimated $55 , according to committee members . The parking garage would cost about $15 million . Committee members stressed that the figures were estimates and that the cost of the total package could be reduced because of more than $15 that might be available under state reimbursement plans . For example , $4 million might be available for the garage and at least a portion of $15 million set aside for the Hynes Auditorium might be available to finance both a $5 million refurbishing of the Hynes along with money for the new North Station exhibition hall . An earlier proposal to expand Hynes was ruled out because of itsprohibitive cost , estmiated at $32 million . The committee also ruled out the possibility of selling the Hynes to the Prudential Center . The recommendations of the experts yesterday ruled out the Revere site and a Northern avenue-South Boston site for the complex . According to financial projections provided by the investment firm of Blythe Eastman-Payne Webber , the bonding for the project could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taxes . That increase is expected to provide an additional $6 million a year starting in 1983 . At the same time , a new arena is expected to provide $7 million annually to the state in payroll , meals and sales taxes . Tsongas , along with Tom Hynes of the real estate management firm of Meredith and Grew , said the next step would be for the financial and architectural experts to return in about three weeks with more precise figures and designs . Those designs are being completed by different architectural consultants , including Moshe Safdie , Hugh Stubbins Associates and Earle Flansburgh Associates . The financial package still needs help from the state Legislature , including approval of the increase in the hotel rooms tax . However , hotel owners , along with legislative leaders , have pledged support for the increase . " I feel very comfortable about this meeting . We know exactly where we ' re going now and how to get there , " said Tsongas.                  @ @ @
