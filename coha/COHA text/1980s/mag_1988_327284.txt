December 1987 to December 1988 , a heavy toll : 318 Palestinians killed by Israeli soldiers , eleven Israelis dead , more than 7,000 Palestinians injured , 15,000 arrested , 12,000 jailed and 34 deported . <P> For the cause , the sons of Palestine are ready to die . That simple but powerful fact keeps the intifadeh going strong a year after it erupted in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip . Khaled Tbeilah , 14 , who worked in a candy factory to help feed his family when he was not throwing stones at Israeli patrols , became one of the most recent Palestinian " martyrs " on Oct. 18 , when a plastic bullet fired by an Israeli soldier in the West Bank city of Nablus killed him . His parents and nine siblings are grieving but are no less determined to fight on against Israel 's occupation of their land . <P> THE FATHER Abdul-Wahhab Tbeilah , 58 , is a generation removed from the young men who started the revolt , and did not think like them when the uprising erupted . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Nablus , had dulled after 21 years of occupation . An auto mechanic , he worked hard to keep his large family in their 400-year-old two-room ancestral home in the Casbah of Nablus . He lived for his children , hoping they would be educated enough someday to become doctors and teachers . Then politics intruded into his quiet life and , given the frequent general strikes called by intifadeh leaders , he decided to quit his job in Israel . The $130 a month he now earns as a guard at a religious school is not nearly enough to provide even modest comfort . " Financially , " says Abu Ali , as he is called , " I am tired . " <P> In some ways , he wishes he could turn back the clock to before last December , but he has accepted the violent politicization of his life through a combination of religious faith and nationalism . Despite his grief , he speaks with pride of Khaled 's " martyrdom . " " Our contribution to the intifadeh , " he says , " has moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 41 , betrays the strain of trying to run a home during a year of anguish . She still oversees her large household with a firm hand , although providing the daily necessities is no longer a simple task . She has drawn up a stringent budget that allocates her husband 's paycheck entirely for groceries and the children 's clothes and medicine . Amid shortages and strikes , the simple act of buying food has turned into a time-consuming , frustrating chore . Meat is rarely served at her table ; even chicken or frozen fish appears no more than once a week . <P> Much of the time Fryal is terrified that Israeli soldiers will break into the apartment and take her men away for interrogation . Remembering such nighttime incidents , she blinks back tears . " I start bleeding inside when I see my husband humiliated and my sons beaten . " Yet she does not attempt to dissuade her sons from active involvement in the uprising . Opening a photo album , she stares at the face of the Khaled she remembers as a " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the next breath she proudly praises him as a " Palestinian nationalist . "
