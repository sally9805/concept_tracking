THY NEIGHBOR 'S WIFE by Gay Talese ; Doubleday ; 568pages ; $14.95 <P> With bestsellers on the New York Times ( The Kingdom and the Power ) and the Mafia ( Honor Thy Father ) to his credit , Author Gay Talese felt ready to tackle a really big subject for his next book . In 1971 he noticed a massage parlor near one of his favorite bars on Manhattan 's East Side . Instead of saying " There goes the neighborhood , " he decided that something was up , perhaps nothing less than " the redefinition of morality in America . " An indefatigable reporter , Talese plunged into the world of commercial sex , not just patronizing massage parlors but also managing two of them . He saw " numerous " X-rated films , did research at topless bars , crisscrossed the country in search of nude encounter groups . His work attracted snickering publicity , strained his marriage and caused him to miss his deadline by five years . <P> At long last Talese has got his story into print , and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , did Nude Model Diane Webber 's great-great-grandmother die ? ( An Indian shot her in the back . ) Did General Custer carry life insurance into the battle of Little Big Horn ? ( Yes , a $5,000 policy with New York Life . ) What covered the circular bed in Hugh Hefner 's private DC-9 ? ( A coverlet made of Tasmanian opossum fur . ) <P> No book that somberly enshrines such trivia can be all bad ; fun is fun , whether intended or not . But well over 500 pages of details should probably , finally , add up to something more than polymorphism , and Thy Neighbor 's Wife does not . Talese 's subject is not " sex in America , " as he claims , but rather a narrow band of U.S. citizens : married middle-class males now in middle age who want more sex with more women than society and , usually , their wives condone . Talese identifies with all the neatly dressed clients of massage parlors ; " He was them , " the author writes of himself , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the point of distraction with adolescent fantasies have their rights as well as their problems , along with everyone else . But Talese does not let it go at that . He paints his male characters as victims , healthy ids thwarted by church , state , censors and , most devastatingly , uncooperative women . <P> This largely buried argument is all that connects the book 's welter of anecdotes . A Chicago teen-ager named Harold Rubin is limned practicing self-abuse over photographs of nude women . He is joined in the narrative by the newly married Hugh Hefner , who wanders the streets and gazes at apartment windows where women might appear . Hefner makes room later for John Bullaro , a married Los Angeles insurance executive who bicycles to Venice Beach on Sundays to ogle sunbathers.
