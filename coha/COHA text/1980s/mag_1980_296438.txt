The U.S. weighs hitting Moscow where it would really hurt <P> In Moscow last week , truck after truck rolled to a stop outside the new press building near the Foreign Ministry , and fur-hatted workers unloaded crates of telephone and telex equipment . A mile north of the Kremlin , electricians toiled in the Olimpiisky Sports Center , which will be the largest covered stadium in Europe . Near by , other workers rushed to finish a huge swimming arena . In classrooms and auditoriums all over Moscow , some 200,000 prospective tour guides , waiters and other staffers continued learning foreign languages and the foibles of the 300,000 tourists who are expected at this summer 's Olympic Games . <P> Thus , as far as Soviet officials were concerned , the Games were still on . But around the world there was a growing debate among diplomats , Olympic officials , champion athletes , politicians and sports fans over the Carter Administration 's proposal that the Games be moved to another country , postponed or boycotted to protest the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan . The Soviets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He is going too far . This has nothing to do with Afghanistan . It is America 's pure anti-Sovietism coming out again . " <P> The fact is that there is probably no single action short of war that would punish Moscow more than to have the Olympics taken away or spoiled . As the first Communist country to play host to the modern Games in their 84-year history , the U.S.S.R. is determined to turn them into a model show . Over the past three years , the Soviets have spent , by their official figures , $375 million in preparation for the Olympics , including the construction of 99 arenas , dormitories and other buildings . The Moscow Olympics are meant to be a monument to the Soviets ' selfesteem , an extravaganza of self-congratulation that in a way betrays their profound insecurities . With so tempting a target , the Carter Administration last week was doing some purposeful sighting . Secretary of State Cyrus Vance announced a mid-February deadline for a Soviet pull-out from Afghanistan if the Games are to on as scheduled . Appearing on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he lad asked the U.S. Olympic Committee to Boycott the summer Games or move the Olympics to another city unless the Soviets withdrew from Afghanistan by the February deadline . Said Carter : " Neither nor the American people will support sending the American team to Moscow while Soviet troops are in Afghanistan . " <P> Only the International Olympic Committee can make the decision to move the Games . Deputy Secretary of State Warren Christopher , who at the President 's behest ounded out NATO members about shifting the Games , found them cool to the idea . Said French Minister of Youth and <P> Sports Jean-Pierre Soisson : " The Olympics are a sporting event , not a political affair . " That , of course , is not true . The Olympics long ago became politicized , with authoritarian societies like Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union sparing no effort to train their athletes-all in the hopes of piling up gold medals as proof of the superiority of their political systems .                 @ @ @ @
