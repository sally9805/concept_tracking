As the day drew near for a House vote on aid to the Nicaraguan contras , the Heritage Foundation massed its forces on behalf of the rebel troops . In its snug maroon auditorium just a few blocks from the Capitol , it held an all-day seminar for congressional staffers . The guests of honor : two top contra officers and a Nicaraguan opposition journalist . A week later Heritage issued a brisk nine-page report titled Nicaragua 's Terrorist Connection , copies of which were distributed by hand to all Congressmen and to targeted staff members . Heritage 's pro-contra blitz was on . The reign of the pensive , passive , pipe-smoking Washington think tank is under assault . These venerable research institutions , which sprang up in the first decades of this century , are being upstaged by groups of intellectual crusaders that helped make the Republicans the party of ideas and paved the way for Ronald Reagan 's election . The new " advocacy tanks " see themselves as more than merely idea incubators ; they also take on the task of selling those ideas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the American Enterprise Institute , are finding it harder to maintain their public influence and attract funds from corporations and private foundations . A.E.I. , once Washington 's most influential citadel of mainstream conservative policy research , has perhaps been the most seriously injured by the rise of the advocacy tanks . In 1980 it looked as though A.E.I. would be the darling of the Reagan Administration . But as the advocacy tanks sprang up , it became clear that the thoughtful , stodgy institute was not at the cutting edge of influence . Corporate givers , who want a return on their money as well as some deep thinking , noted the change . After years of steady increases , donations declined slightly this past year . The institute had to cut planned spending by 25% during the past year and reduce its 154-member staff by about 45 . <P> Think tanks are privately funded , nonprofit , tax-exempt foundations dedicated to public-policy research . Traditional ones may be slightly to the right or to the left of center , but they have made a show of evenhandedness in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buildings , ideas simmered until they percolated into books and monographs that laid the foundation for legislation . " These groups , " says James A. Smith , a historian at the Twentieth Century Fund in Manhattan who is writing a book on public-policy organizations , " were inspired by the belief that people of divergent political viewpoints and interests could get together , discuss the facts and reach some kind of policy consensus . " <P> But when Reagan swept into Washington , his appointments gave bureaucratic access to a different league of players : " movement conservatives , " who had a specific and radical agenda in mind . " The conservative elite , " says Sidney Blumenthal , author of the forthcoming book The Rise of the Counter- Establishment , " sees itself as a counter to the liberal establishment , which includes not only liberals but traditional Republicans . Institution by institution , the conservatives have built up an infrastructure in the shadow of the liberal establishment , to combat and finally to overthrow it . The think tanks are obviously an important part of the movement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elite " the most dramatic political development in recent American history . "
