txt OUR YEARS AGO , a brown.halred girl with large , cautious eyes enrolled in a north suburban high school . She was new in town , from a very poor family , and did not speak a word of English . But Juanita , as she will be called , worked very hard , sometimes studying until 2 or 3 a.m. at the kitchen table while her family slept . She got A 's in many classes , made the honor roll , learned fluent English , and by the middle of her senior year had a solid B average . Juanita 's guidance counselor was delighted with her progress and encouraged the diligent teen-ager to apply to colleges . The counselor said Juanita should have no trouble ' getting financial aid . " I was so excited , " Juanita remembers . " I just kept thinking , next year I 'll be in college . " She was quick in math and dreamed of  --  becoming a certified public accountant , or perhaps a lawyer . Then in January , Juanita told her father about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that week , during a meeting about college with her guidance counselor ; Juanita burst into tears and finally revealed a secret she had told no one in four years , not even her best friend . JUANITA IS an Illegal alien . Her father would not let her apply for financial aidtecause he would have to reveal on the forms that he is , not in this country legally . He is desperately afraid of being deported back to Mexico . On Tuesday , Juanita will be the lirst member of her family to be graduated from ' high school . But it will not be a happy day . " I guess that 's my last day of school , " she says sadly . She is not referring to the last day before summer vacation . To the 18-year-old girl , her situation seems confusing and unfair .. All she can think of is. that she struggled to succeed in the way Americans ' are taught and now is faced with returning to the impoverished existence her parents came to America to escape . The problem with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years she Her situation seem confusing and unfair . She struggled to succeed in the way Americans are taught and now is faced with returning to the impoverished existence her parents came to America to escape . was busily making good grades . " I registered for high school and nobody asked for a green card ( proof of legal status ) , " she explained . " I thought it would be the same in college . " Meanwhile , high school students from Cuba , Haiti , and other countries are able to receive financial aid under the status of political refugees . " I do n't know what 's the difference between them and me , " Juanita says . Although Juanita surely is not alone in her . ' the Problem is one that authorities say only recently has come to light . Until ' now , the illegal alien population in the Chicago area ? estimated to be as large as 500,000 to 800,000 ? has been relatively young . Only now are ' large numbers of children of illegal aliens reaching college age , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the poverty their parents face . JUANITA 'S GUIDANCE counselor says Juanita 's case is the first of this kind she has dealt with . But she says she expects many mote will come , given the large illegal alien population in the district , where Mexicans are sought for gardening , doilies-tic , and factory work . I have n't heard much about this problem , but I think we 're going to see a rise in it , " says Clara Fitzpatrick , assistant regional director of the College Board , the'national processing association for student financial aid forms . The ironies are numerous in Juanita 's case . She says the main reason her father brought the family to America was ' so his children could go to school . In Mexico , tuition is required for high school and the family was too poor to pay . ' " All he wanted is that we have an educe-'Ron , so we wo n't have to suffer like he did , " Juanita says , twisting her hands in her lap as she sat in the home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her father she talked to a reporter , even with the promise her name would not be used . ) She remembers life in Mexico as " terrible . " Her parents and seven children were squeezed Into a dilapidated two-room apartment on the outskirts'of Mexico City . Her // A family 's secret dims student 's bright future // three older sisters went through grammar school and then began working . They married and still are in Mexico . In 1976 , Juanita 's father brought her and the rest of the family ? three other children now aged 15 , 13 , and 11 ? to the United States . Another baby was born here two years ago . JUANITA 'S FATHEIt makes a subsistence wage as a landscaper . The entire family lives in a two  --  room apartment , paying $260 a month for the cramped tirst.floor quarters . As the eldest child , Juanita has had to be part-time breadwinner , interpreter , and chauffeur for the family . On a typical school day , she would get up at 7 a.m. , take her brothers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3:30 p.m . Then she would go home , help her mother for an hour , and go to work at the customer service desk of a discount department store . She would get off work at 10:30 p.m. and then , " I went right to the kitchen to do my homework . " She would study until early morning , worrying that she was keeping the family awake in the other room . She gives her $3.80-an-hour wages to the family , and says she has no hope of earning enough money to send herself through college . The catch , she knows , is that to get a decent paying - job she needs a green card , and her chances of getting that are virtually nil . ACCORDING TO William r . Skidmore of the Chicago office of the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service , the agency is only now processing applications filed before Aug. 15 , 1975 , And those are for aliens with high priority ? highly skilled professionals and relatives of legal Mexican Immigrants . The only chance Juanita 's parents will have of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a U.S. citizen because he was born here ) becomes 21 and is able to make application for his parents . The U.S. has a regular quota of 290,000 immigrants a year from all over the world , only 20,000 per country . " There 's such a waiting list for Mexico that it 's almost impossible to get in if you 're not in one of the preference categories , " Skidmore says . ( Political refugees such as the Vietnamese boat people and the Cuban exiles are admitted by special legislation , ) . . The only other way a nonpriority alien can get a green card ? other than by marrying a U.S. citizen. ? is ? through a " suspension of deportation order , " a widely discussed but misunderstood provision , according to Jim Bailey of the Immigration Service 's deportation office . The provision states ' that if an alien has been in the country for seven years and can demonstrate " extreme hardship and good moral character , " his deportation can be suspended . But Bailey says the process is long , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and results in very few suspensions granted . Moreover , the alien must have been declared depbrtable before he is eligible to apply for a suspension . So the alien must , in effect , turn himself in and risk deportation as the first step in The process . " MANY ALIENS are under the Impression they can walk right into our office if they 've been here seven years and get a green card , " Bailey says . " No way . " So in the foreseeable future , Juanita expects to work at menial jobs for low wages , much like every other family member has done . She has not considered marriage . Once she learned she would not be able to go to college , her grades dropped . " I feel ashamed of myself . I should have kept my grades up , ' she says . " But I thought , ' What should I study for if I 'm not going to college ? ' " It 's possible that a private university could arrange  --  to send Juanita to college with private @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Northwestern University , said such an arrangement still would require " a tremendous amount of trust " on the part of the family . Despite her disappointment , Juanita said she still would rather be in America than in Mexico , where she thinks her chances for employment are very slim . " At least here , " she says , " you can earn some money ; even if you do n't have a college education . " What 's discouraging , she says , is that site wanted to go for so much more .
