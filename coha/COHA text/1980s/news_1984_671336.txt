In the last decade , though , engineers and inventors have been re-examining basic bicycle design and have developed interesting and more efficient alternatives . These include high-speed tricycles , multirider vehicles capable of cruising at highway speed , and arm-powered bicycles for people who can not use their legs. // One development that could have a major impact for cycling enthusiasts is the renewed interest in the recumbent bicycle , in which the rider pedals while lying on his back instead of sitting upright or crouching forward , as with a standard bicycle . The recumbent bicycle was introduced 50 years ago but , despite advantages that its proponents say include greater comfort , increased speed due to lower wind resistance and greater safety , it failed to catch on. // <> <> Rider Is Not Thrown // " I got discouraged reading about people killing themselves by going over the handlebars of regular bikes " in accidents , said David Gordon Wilson , a professor of mechanical engineering at Massachusetts Institute of Technology , who has designed a series of recumbent bicycles. // He said recumbent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ automobiles because the rider is closer to the ground and is not thrown forward , head-first , over the handlebars , as is often the case with standard bikes. // In a paper given today at the annual meeting of the Society of Automotive Engineers here , he described an incident that happened to him when a tire pump jammed in the spokes of the front wheel as he was riding his Avatar 2000 recumbent bicycle. // " This type of accident on a conventional bicycle can result in very severe injury , often including skull or spinal fracture , " he said. // But in the Avatar , he said , " the front wheel locked and skidded , but the feet could immediately be put on the ground . The pump was ruined , one front-wheel spoke was slightly bent and the front-fork paint was chipped , but no other damage occurred. " // <> <> New Designs Were Discouraged // Professor Wilson and Gardner Martin , who designed and manufactures the Easy Racer recumbent , said new bicycle designs were discouraged around the turn of the century by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and banned non-standard designs , and by the advent of the automobile . Interest in human-powered vehicles was rekindled by the Arab oil embargoes. // Recumbent technology is evolving , and there are a number of differences in design among those making the bicycles . For example , the handlebars on the Avatar are under the seat , which Professor Wilson says improves safety. // Mr. Martin ' s Easy Racer model , in contrast , has handlebars in front of the rider , where a partial fairing to reduce wind resistance can be mounted . The use of a partial fairing , in effect a streamlined front windshield , has been found to reduce wind resistance by as much as 20 percent . In addition , a recumbent rider exposes less of his body and bicycle to the wind than a rider on a standard bike. // Reducing aerodynamic drag is key in the new bicycle designs . Studies have shown that 80 percent of the cyclist ' s effort at 18 miles an hour on level ground goes to overcome wind resistance. // <> <> New Designs Aim for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contests . The current speed champion is a recumbent tricycle , in which two riders are seated back to back , that has gone faster than 60 miles an hour in short bursts . Professor Wilson ' s Avatar , with a racing fairing attached , has gone as fast as 51. 9 miles an hour. // Another approach , developed by engineering students at the University of Cincinnati , is the Pegasus , a four-wheel , four-rider machine with a streamlined fiberglass shell , which went as fast as 43. 69 miles an hour and was peddled the 210 miles from Cleveland to Cincinnati in two days by three crews of riders . Professor Dean Shupe , the faculty adviser on the project , said Pegasus is part of an effort to develop a practical , human- powered vehicle that would be useful for short trips. // Such a vehicle , he said , would probably have four wheels for stability , be enclosed for weather protection and have space for an additional passenger , although it could be operated by one person . The Pegasus has head and tail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of the features necessary if bicycles are to gain wide acceptance as commuter vehicles . It also has a sleek body shell that turned heads as it was ridden this week along the streets of Windsor , Ontario , and Detroit. // <> <> Applications in Automobiles // So far the manufacture of non- standard bicycles has remained a cottage industry , although Mr. Martin said he has sold nearly 1 , 000 Easy Racers at about $800 each . About a half-dozen manufacturers are believed to be selling recumbent models at prices ranging from a few hundred dollars to a few thousand . The Avatar 2000 , for example , costs $2 , 175. // Even if human-powered vehicles for everyday transportation are not likely to displace automobiles any time soon , projects like Pegasus help develop technology that is applicable to motorized vehicles , according to William Shapton of Michigan Technical University . " When you ' ve only got pedal power , you pay a lot of attention to rolling resistance and aerodynamics , " he said . " In the long run , developments in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gasoline-powered vehicle that used bicycle-related technology , a 230-pound machine built by Douglas J. Malewicki , got more than 157 miles per gallon at a steady freeway speed of 55 miles an hour. // New approaches to vehicles may also permit a greater degree of freedom for the handicapped . Douglas F. Schwandt of the Veteran ' s Administration ' s Rehabilitation Research and Development Center in Palo Alto , Calif. , has developed bicycles driven by arm power that can be used by people who can not use their legs. // Mr. Schwandt has built two models , one for a single rider , and a tandem that enables an able-bodied person and a handicapped person to ride together. // Both models replace the standard handlebars with a pair of handles attached to a standard bicycle drive system , which runs to the front wheel and which also steers . The rider sits in a chair position with the legs extended and moves forward by " pedaling " with his arms . Both models have brakes built into the drive system and wheeled outriggers to prevent tipping over. // Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a typical wheelchair. //
