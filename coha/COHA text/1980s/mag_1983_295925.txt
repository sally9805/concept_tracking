THE END OF THE WORLD NEWS by Anthony Burgess McGraw-Hill ; 389 pages ; $15.95 <P> Anthony Burgess , 66 , has gone out on some strong limbs to avoid repeating himself . Earthly Powers ( 1980 ) , for instance , presented an aging homosexual writer trying to secure canonization for his friend , a deceased Pope . In his 26th novel and most bizarre work since A Clockwork Orange ( 1962 ) , the author raises the stakes in his gamble for freshness . The End of the World News offers a trio of plots linked by irony and caustic satire . <P> Burgess describes this fiction as an " entertainment " rather than a novel . In a dust-jacket blurb he announces that the discovery of the unconscious , the possibility of universal socialism and man 's ability to live in outer space are the century 's " three greatest events . " The End of the World News ( the BBC news readers ' sign-off phrase ) amplifies those themes with a twist , and it is a twist of the dial . Reading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of viewing television in the " three-screen family . " Therefore his postliterary trilogy is broken into prime-time vignettes . <P> Sigmund Freud stars in a segment that seems adapted for Masterpiece Theater . Brownshirted Nazis burst into the Vienna apartment of the founder of psychoanalysis , growling about " rich dirty Jews . " They are cowed by Frau Freud 's response : " We 're middle-class clean Jews . That is why I ask you to wipe your feet . " The master 's cures are just as brisk and effective , the ideal length for docudrama . " You do n't want to die , " Freud assures a patient , " you want to get back into your mother . " From the couch comes the reply , " You 're sure ? " The doctor is , and one visit later , so is his patient . <P> In Burgess 's eyes , Freud is a Victorian Job , plagued by the doctrinal defections of Carl Jung , Otto Rank and his own daughter Anna . The therapist 's love of cigars , which contribute to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Swiss tells Freud 's mother that Sigmund 's smoking is " sheer devotion ... to you , gnadige Frau . " <P> On another channel , Leon Trotsky visits New York City in 1917 to rouse the American proletariat . Burgess tells this story in the form of a libretto for a Broadway musical , complete with lyrics . Trotsky falls for Olga , a hardheaded party worker , while his wife cavorts with a wealthy socialist . Four hearts beat as one until the revolutionary 's son is reported missing . Trotsky 's life is changed forever when he is reunited with the boy , and the songs turn as sentimental as the story . At the finale , the hero chants , " Family 's first , / Love is completeness , / Power 's a burnt-out star. / To redeem with sweetness/ The cursed/ Things we all are , / Family 's first-/ By far ! "
