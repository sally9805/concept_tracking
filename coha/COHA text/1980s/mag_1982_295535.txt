Running for Governor with new black friends <P> Given the history , what astonishes one is this tenderness . An odd , sweet quiet comes upon the field and grove in the September afternoon . The people , after their rally , rest almost dreamily on the threadbare grass . George Wallace has spoken . He sits in his wheelchair on the small flatbed metal stage in the park at Noccalula Falls near Gadsden . The people come to him . They fall into a long , orderly line to file past and take his hand and have him sign their Wallace posters . <P> Their gazes mix awe and deep familiarity and shyness . They are blue-collar people , or else small farmers who work these hills . Mostly they have rough , country faces and washed , flat , distantly Celtic eyes . People in wheelchairs are pushed up to his wheelchair , and George Wallace reaches out the gentlest communing hands to them , and spends long moments with each , consoling and almost , one thinks , healing . He has the nimbus of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who has passed through the fire and the greater world ; he has come back to them from history , come back with powder burns . <P> Northerners should watch Wallace with his people . The process is tribal , a rite of communion . Only by watching it can one begin to analyze the disconcerting news that a fairly large number of Alabama blacks have , in 1982 , joined the Wallace tribe . <P> One of George Wallace 's heroes , Stonewall Jackson , had a military premise : " Mystery .

Wallace , at 63 , beat a well-heeled moderate Birmingham suburbanite , George McMillan . Alabama liberals wince at the choice available in November : either George Wallace or the Republicans ' pistol-packing law-and-order Reaganite mayor of Montgomery , Emory Folmar . In the weird way that these things happen , Folmar , 52 , is playing the part of the old George Wallace in this race , running against the new George Wallace , the aging and re-upholstered seg . <P> <P> The chief mystery of the campaign , at least to those with memories that run back 20 years , is that many black Alabamians are voting for Wallace , and even working in his cause . The Deep South is supposed to be the one American region where the past means something . <P> The Alabama Democratic Conference , the state 's black political machine , strongly supported McMillan in the primary . They brought in Jesse Jackson and Coretta Scott King to speak against Wallace , to remind blacks of what Wallace had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) went against Wallace . Still , it was the combination of rural blacks and rural whites and blue-collar workers that won for Wallace . That any blacks at all enlisted with Wallace is reason to reflect .
