JONATHAN WINTERSNO FOOLING Jonathan Winters ' face relaxes into soft lines , and he slouches deep into the sofa of his new Santa Barbara home . He closes his eyes for a moment and remembers , That was the longest laugh I ever got in my life . It was a funny picture-156 pigeons .... " Jonathan brushes an imaginary speck from the front of the Cincinnati Reds baseball uniform he is wearing ( he has an uncanny resemblance to Babe Ruth ( and adds , " I guess it was the funniest picture I ever painted verbally . " Jonathan Winters paints thousands of funny verbal pictures , and he does it instantly . A genius of improvisation , he can loose lightning bolts of his own wacky brand of humor at the drop of a straight line . " It 's a matter of instantly picturing the situation in your mind , then reacting to it , " Jonathan says , " I have to believe in my warped little mind the audience out there will see the same picture and laugh , " Jonathan Winters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , characters and sound effects that spring from the fertile and evidently bottomless well of his mind . He seems to love to transform himself instantly into fantasy characters and then , for one brief moment , to live their dream lives . Perhaps it is the Walter Mitty within him struggling to get out . Yet , not everything is funny to Jonathan Winters . He is much more than a life-sized , cardboard cutout grinning like a court jester . He is an enormously complex man with little tolerance for convention , and beneath much of his humor is the hard , cutting edge of satire and a strong social statement . Like all great comedians , he is serious about being funny , and in sudden moments of iconoclastic fervor , he will fearlessly smash any idol he finds in his path . It takes very little to get Jonathan 's impulsive mind working . A verbal challenge such as , " Jonathan , you 're in Kentucky , a hillbilly sitting on a front porch , - and his voice quickly dissolves into a backwoods drawl , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among those plum trees and those apple trees ; they 're all over the ground , wrinkled and shriveled . My face is jest like ' em . You see those cows down there ? Made of tin , and the horses made of wood . Jest too much of a chore to go down thar and feed them . Look at that cat , eye all shriveled , too . Some kid poked her . But that eye will roll back before winter , just like a pinball machine . Right now the eye is white . We call her Little Orphan Annie . " Images , images , images . Yet , when asked to dream up a visual image of himself , he has to think hard for a moment , twisting and changing the images in his mind until he says , " I 'm sitting in front of a full-length mirror , nude , painting a suit on myself , putting the little white collar on , the tie . I 'd have to shave my chest and probably my legs . I 'd have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He laughs for a moment , liking the picture . Jonathan is obsessed with entertaining ; compelled to be funny ; he ca n't walk into a restaurant or a hotel or arrive at a party without feeling the desire to be " on . " Recently , after a lunch at the Santa Barbara Biltmore Hotel , he passed the beauty shop on the way out . Quickly stepping inside he began to assume the character of a hairdresser and entertained the startled , yet delighted customers for 20 minutes . Some people may not laugh at everything , Jonathan says , but then he ca n't be funny to everyone . What he fears the most is the person who never laughs  --  the person without a sense of humor . " A sense of humor is essential , " he says . " It will see you through almost any kind of tragedy ; it will see you through life . What 's frightening to me is the guy who says ( Jonathan speaks with a Bronx accent : ' What did you say about me ? ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' What is funny to you ? ' Nothing . ' That 's scary . " At the other end of the spectrum are meetings and moments that Jonathan will cherish forever . One such moment came when he shook the hand of Neil Armstrong . At that meeting , the comedian said simply , " Dayton , Ohio . " And Armstrong said , " Boy , do I know you . I 'm from Wapakoneta. - And Jonathan thought , " My God , this man who came from a town near Dayton about the size of this room  --  we did n't even play them in football  --  is the first man to step on the moon ! " Meeting Neil Armstrong was doubly important to Jonathan-40 years earlier he shook the hand of the man who had climbed the first rung of the ladder into space , Orville Wright . Jonathan Winters was born in Dayton on November 11 , 1925 . When people ask him what sign he was born under , he replies , " Slippery when wet . " He had no brothers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great break . There was very little in the will . I got the table . " He lived with his mother , who worked in radio for 35 years ? " Kind of a watered down Arlene Francis , " Jonathan says  --  his grandmother and a stepfather . He listened to these older people . " I was like a gigantic sponge , absorbing everything I heard , " Jonathan remembers . " I felt like I had this fantastic movie camera on my shoulder with two lenses taking pictures and recording the sounds of people , factories , ships , cars . All I had to do was go in the darkroom and develop what I had seen and heard . " Later , he used the people he knew and lived with in his childhood as part of his comedy routines . The grandma character , old Maude Frickert , was something like his Aunt Lou Perks . " My aunt was a big lady with snow-white hair , " Jonathan says . " She had a great sense of humor . But like Grandma Frickert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maybe ' blue ' old lady would be a better word . " To prove his point , Jonathan 's face turns lemonlike again , and the creaky voice of Maude Frickert begins to speak : " I 'm 87 years old , and I 've had seven husbands , but Tom , the hired boy  --  he 's 30 ? is built like a Belgian horse . He 's so strong he carries me to bed every night . We play pretend ; what we call rescue . He carries me up there to my room and puts me on the old quilt . . . he 's a joy to have around . I just look at him . He 's a bronzed god . In the winter months , he 'll get white , but I have some stain . I often keep him stained . - Jonathan learned by listening , but he did n't listen well in school , although he did have a love for art and , as he says , " recess . " He finally quit school and joined the Marine Corps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a big summer camp , " Jonathan recalls . He was a Marine corporal stationed on the aircraft carrier Bon Homme Richard . After completing three years of " camp , " he went back to school to study art . There he met Eileen , a slim , attractive girl with sparkling blue eyes . They were married in 1948 . Not long after their marriage , Jonathan asked her why she married him . She replied , " Because I thought you were the funniest man in my life . " To develop this natural ability to be funny , Jonathan took a job as a disc jockey at the local radio station in Dayton , WING . Since he had no one to interview on the air , he started to make up his own characters . In the next two and a half years , he developed the routines that he would use so successfully as a stand-up comedian . In 1953 , Jonathan headed for New York with $56.43 stuffed in his pocket . He told Eileen that if he could n't make it with comedy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He made it in seven months . The Winters ' family  --  including son Jonathan ( Jay ) , born in Dayton , and daughter Lucinda , born in Bronxville  --  lived in New York for the next 11 years . Jonathan played the nightclubs , made TV guest appearances on Steve Allen 's " Tonight Show , " Jack Parr 's " Tonight Show " and " The Gary Moore Show . " He even took a one-time shot at the theater in John Murray Anderson 's Almanac . But his fondest memory of those days came when Alistair Cooke asked him to be a guest on " Omnibus " ; Jonathan was the first comedian ever asked to be on that show . The comedy scene of the mid- ' 50s was the perfect place for Jonathan 's satirical , nonconformist style of humor to be born . American people were suffering from lethargy . They were searching for their own private niche , a place to get away from the world and the worry about the " bomb " even if it meant burrowing into a homemade bomb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to shake people awake . " Mort Sahl , Lenny Bruce  --  all of us wanted to turn this attitude around somehow , " Jonathan says . " We wanted them to listen . Lenny gave them a pretty good shock . He had this cattle prod that he turned on the public and  --  wow  --  they either went with it or jumped . My only criticism of Lenny  --  and I knew him very well  --  was that he wanted to get them up in their seats twisting and turning , almost in agony . It worked ; there were a lot of people picking up on the shock value , but I kept thinking of the families with kids and how they were worried that this stuff was getting pretty raunchy . I mean , I do n't think of myself as a cardboard cutout of Pat Boone , but I always argue that you can be funny without being filthy . " Mort Sahl was and is one of the brightest guys around for what he does  --  political satire , commenting on the times , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to China . I 've always liked Mort , and I have a great respect for him . He and I were similar except he went political , while I tried to cover the general subjects . We were both trying to tell the truth though , and it can be awfully hard to tell the truth through jokes . " You know , " Jonathan sighs , " a comedian says funny things . A comic does funny things . Laurel and Hardy were the greatest comics . No one has replaced them , not Rowan and Martin , not Martin and Lewis  --  nobody . Abbott and Costello did n't even come close . Thank goodness , every once in a while someone like Laurel and Hardy comes along . They were never dirty , never told a joke , but they did funny things . " Suddenly Jonathan changes his face and voice into the skinny Stan Laurel and mimics : Laurel : " What is that ? " Hardy : ( Patronizing ) " That is a tarantula . Touch it , and it will bite you. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I know a tarantula when I see one . " ( He reaches out to touch it . ) " Ouch ! It did bite me ! " " You can make anybody funny , " Jonathan says , back in his own voice . " There are a lot of raised eyebrows about that , but you can . You can put funny clothes on them , or you can give them funny things to do or say , but the one thing you ca n't do is make them think funny . Thinking funny is , I believe , a God-given talent . " Jonathan has been using his talent to " think funny " for more than 50 years , and he has finally decided to write some of his thoughts down on paper . His autobiography is titled I Could n't Wait for Success , So I Went on Ahead without It . The book is not a typical Hollywood diary of who did what with whom and when . Rather , it is a time-capsule report about what a man thinks of the world and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought . " I just sat down one day in 1975 and started to write , " Jonathan Continued on page 118 March ' 82 Jonathan Winters continued from page 61 says . " Not with the idea of putting it on all the bookshelves in America . I just thought it was time for me to write down all the things I thought were important to me . I believe I had said a lot in my comedy , but maybe I had n't said enough . So I took my time and wrote it all down by hand  --  some 500 pages in a large artist 's sketchbook . " One publisher looked at the manuscript , and the first thing he asked me was , ' What about your affairs ? ' I said , ' They 're all in order . ' Besides what kind of guy runs down the roadway yelling , ' Hey , I just made it with Alma ! ' " It 's a book in which I tell the truth ; my feeling about doctors , lawyers , dentists ( leaving you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' Sorry , Jon , I want to watch the World Series ? . I talk about the toys I had as a kid , what it might feel like to be a seagull and what heroes are like . I try to say what I feel about laughter and sorrow and pain . " I dedicated the book to ' all people who are overly sensitive . ' They should never be ashamed of it ; it beats being overly bitter . The overly sensitive are on a different frequency , and they can turn their antennas a little different and pick up signals that are incredible . Sure , they take a lot of blows , but they live a richer life . " Jonathan wrote one other book , a little book with his own drawings called Mousebreath , Nonconformity and Other Social Ills . " It sold 51 copies , " he says , " to small institutions . The patients threw them at each other . One guy ate my book . That 's all right . l 've done the same thing . National @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away from the color photos of the turtle cemetery on the Galapagos Islands . " Jonathan sinks deeper in the couch and pats his stomach , perhaps thinking about lunch only an hour away . Around him on the walls of his private studio hang some personal memorabilia ; photos of himself in baseball uniforms ; a framed set of Marine gunnery sergeant stripes ; a small painting by Walter Lantz showing Woody Woodpicker swimming through the surf to escape a shark ; and one painting by Jonathan Winters titled Conductor in Space , a surrealistic fantasy image that might be compared to the paintings of artist Paul Klee . " I started out to be an artist , " he says . " Why did I quit ? Starvation was a factor . But the truth is I did n't have a style . " It took 25 years before he discovered his own style in art , and then he started painting again . Then , in 1975 , his paintings were featured in a show at the Ankrum Gallery in Los Angeles . Jonathan designed the brochure for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paintings . " I sold about 95 percent of my canvases at that show , " Jonathan says . " I also got a good write-up from the Los Angeles Times ' art critic . To me , painting is therapy . I enjoy the privacy of art . it 's fun to come down here and relax . I consider it one of the rare times in one 's life when you can be your own man . " In painting I also think it 's important to see something on the canvas that you can recognize , " Jonathan continues , his eyes very serious . " I ca n't believe  --  and I am sure this next remark will bring about some raised eyebrows , but there is too much of modern art that is a cop-out for people who ca n't draw or paint  --  I ca n't believe that you can take cobalt blue acrylic paint and throw it against a 55- by 60-foot canvas and say it belongs in a museum . First of all , you have to learn how to draw . Learn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chickens , quick . But to do this ? " Jonathan throws an imaginary glob of paint against the wall and assumes a prissy voice . " ' How 's that ? Oh , exciting . I 'll call it Santa Barbara at Dawn . ' I do n't understand , ' where are the buildings , where are the mountains ? ' That 's it , that 's the way I felt . ' That 's the way you felt , huh ? Right out of the old acrylic tube . Use any turpentine ? Yeah . Whole gallon . Makes that runny feeling . ' Oh ? What 's that running there ? Are those animals ? ' Oh , no , that 's just turpentine . I 'll call it Turpentine Running . ' Jonathan Winters : painter , writer , comedian . What 's next ? Is there some last illusive piece of a master jigsaw ? The answer is yes  --  one last piece . " I want desperately to perform in a good dramatic film , " Jonathan says , leaning forward on his elbows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's just something I want to do . I think I am capable of it . I 've come close a couple of times  --  once with a Rod Serling " Twilight Zone , " and I did the movie The Loved One , which was more of a comedy satire . Of course my first big movie break was It 's a Mad , Mad , Mad , Mad World . I may never do one bigger than that . " I 've seen some of my contemporaries turn the corner and go dramatic . Alec Guinness went from being a comedian all the way around to being a dramatic actor of great force . I 've seen Red Buttons , Ed Wynn , Jackie Gleason . Peter Sellers waited 13 years to do the movie Being There . I do n't know of any actor who would n't have given his right loafer to do that movie . Sellers did a brilliant piece of work . He was one of the most talented men of his time because of his ' ear . ' He could literally leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a German and an American with a hundred dialects . ' ' To keep Winters ' fans going this fall , Jonathan has agreed to appear in six or seven episodes of ABC 's " Mork and Mindy . " You see , Mork married Mindy and gave birth to an Orkan baby named Mearth  --  played by Jonathan . He 's pleased to be working with Robin Williams who does some improvisation on the show . That should give Jonathan a little space to play in , which suits him fine . He is also happy he is on a limited number of shows . " I think comedy should come in little capsules , " Jonathan says . " Comedy is like a precious stone . You hear people say , ' I do n't know when I have laughed as hard as I did tonight , ' and that tells you how unique good comedy is  --  and how scarce . I think a comedian 's appearances on TV should be important ; in essence to sprinkle himself out there rather than unload for a whole season . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sit up and say , ' Hey , I have n't seen him in a long time . ' The idea is to come on with your best shot . " While Jonathan waits for his next best shot to come along , he relaxes comfortably in his newly purchased home in Santa Barbara . " There 's a great tranquility here , " Jonathan says . " It 's quiet , there 's no aircraft going over  --  down in Hollywood it 's a zoo . My grandfather showed me Santa Barbara in the 1940s . He came here around the turn of the century and had a fig ranch , about a hundred acres near the downtown area . He always told me that some day I should try it , so I always dreamed of living in Santa Barbara . " I think of myself as a survivor , " he says seriously for a moment , then quickly changes to comedy and continues . " I want to be buried in a baseball uniform .. . with a parking meter above me . You slip a nickel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the grass . No , I think it would be better to be cremated . I see no reason to water something that is n't going to come up . I just do n't want to take up any space . I have taken up a lot of space and time in my life . " There are a lot of Walter Mittys walking around out there , dreaming their own secret fantasies , pretending they are Superman , Bluebeard the pirate or Robin Hood  --  or maybe even Babe Ruth . Jonathan Winters is only one of them . He just happens to be the funniest . ' A
