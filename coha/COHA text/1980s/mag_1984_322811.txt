THE PHILIPPINES <P> Almost a month has passed since the Philippines held a nationwide election for its 200-seat National Assembly , and still there is no final count . The election commission , whose members are appointed by the government of President Ferdinand Marcos , has conceded that the opposition more than quadrupled its representation , from 14 to at least 62 seats , but has yet to give a final tally for eleven seats . <P> The delay has added fuel to suspicions that the government has engaged in vote fiddling . In the province of Nueva Vizcaya , Opposition Candidate Carlos Padilla was initially reported to have trounced Political Affairs Minister Leonardo Perez by some 19,000 votes . Last week the election commission declared the winner was Perez , who just happened to be its former chairman . <P> Marcos did not wait for the final results to announce a series of austerity measures last week , including a 28.6% de facto devaluation of the peso , designed to meet International Monetary Fund conditions for a new loan to the heavily indebted nation ( total : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alert and had checkpoints set up in the wake of two fires and the murder of a police general . <P> <P> ARGENTINA <P> All in Favor of Unity <P> " We have inaugurated a new political style in the country , " Argentine President Raul Alfonsin declared as he signed a 15-point agreement with former President Mara Estela ( Isabelita ) Martnez de PerOn and the leaders of 14 other parties last week . The pact was another step in Alfonsn 's drive to maintain national unity at a time when the country is facing an annual inflation rate of 568% and growing labor unrest . Some 400,000 miners , bus drivers , waterworks employees and metal-and grain-workers are currently demanding wage increases . <P> The agreement put both the government and the Peronists on record as favoring eventual repayment of the country 's $43.6 billion foreign debt , though its language was so fuzzy as to allow a wide range of interpretations . Still less was said about the austerity program that Alfonsin 's six-month-old government will need to introduce soon if it is to persuade the International Monetary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> A day later , as the widow of Juan Pern prepared to return to Spain , where she has lived in exile since her ouster by a military junta in 1976 , a bomb was found aboard the plane .

" <P> <P> BOLIVIA <P> Win Some , Lose Some <P> Mixing sports and politics is fashionable , but in Bolivia the combination tends to be downright confusing . Four years ago , Bolivia did not send a team to the 1980 Summer Olympics . Though officials blamed a strapped economy , some accused the government of joining the U.S. boycott of the Moscow Games . <P> Last week Bolivia announced it would not send a team to the 1984 Olympics . Again officials pleaded poverty . This time , however , many suspected that the government , which now counts two Communists in the Cabinet , was bent on following the Soviet lead in boycotting the Los Angeles Games .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
