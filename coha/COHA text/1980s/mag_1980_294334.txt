A pheromonal find <P> You ve tried them all . Brut , English Leather ... Old Spice . And somehow the women still turn up their noses . But do n't despair . Help is on the way . <P> Last week a British research team at the University of Warwick announced that it has isolated a steroid in the sweat of males . Highly purified , the substance smells like sandalwood oil , which is used as an ingredient in perfumes . But that is not half its charm . The researchers claim that the steroid is a pheromone , one of a group of chemicals with scents that influence behavior in many species of the animal world . Even better , it is apparently a male sex pheromone , which has a scent that attracts females . Equivalent pheromones exuded by some female insects , for example , draw males from miles around . The Warwick team does not claim such great powers for its discovery ; pheromones seem to have less effect on humans than on lower animals , and one scientist notes , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more in the nature of an immediate empathy . " Still , rumor has it that perfume manufacturers are converging on Warwick in the hope of bottling the precious essence as aftershave lotion that women can not resist .
