Get your hackles up , California . We are here to discuss that choke-thy- neighbor word , water . Here being a quintessentially innocuous looking and provocative setting , the Los Angeles water intercept on Lee Vining Creek in the eastern Sierras . On a brilliant winter afternoon , knee-deep snow covers the intake pond behind a small concrete dam , and a Steller 's jay swoops among the evergreens . Mount Dana , lacking only an Ansel Adams moon , is lit up crisply against a cloudless sky . And in the background ( the sticking point ) , there is the sound of rushing water . <P> By recent court order , some of the creek 's water pours over a narrow spillway and meanders seven miles down its ancient route to Mono Lake . " There 's probably 5 c.f.s. flowing in there , " a water activist remarks in the technical shorthand ( c.f.s. meaning cubic feet per second ) that characterizes California water talk . <P> But since 1941 , most of the Mono Basin 's mountain water has been disappearing from here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about 225 miles south to Los Angeles . The result , as bumper stickers , outraged postcards to the Governor , and sober scientific studies have all amply declared , is that this country 's oldest lake , and one of its most unusual , is being destroyed . Even the Los Angeles department of water and power concedes that the Mono Lake ecosystem could collapse . " We feel comfortable that we have 20 years before it 's going to happen , " says David Babb , a staff naturalist . There is time for more studies . But for now , he says , the ) department has no way to replace its Mono water , 100,000 acre-feet a year , 17% of the city 's supply . The Mono Lake Committee , a courtroom adversary , says it sees an " incremental unraveling " happening at Mono right now . It wants the diversion reduced to 30,000 acre-feet to stabilize the lake at a safe level . <P> What to do ? An acre-foot is the amount of water it would take to flood an acre one foot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lying around for the taking in Southern California , you can probably change your name to Yahweh and begin collecting burnt offerings . No obvious replacement source presented itself in the Mono Lake dispute until recently , when an economist named Zach Willey suggested that the city and the environmentalists get together to buy water from farmers on the western side of the Sierras in California 's vast central valley . <P> Water marketing , first debated in the 1970s , was an appealing idea : farmers use about 85% of California 's water , and because they get it from state and federal water projects at subsidized rates , they tend to squander it . An acre- foot that costs Southern California urbanites $230 may cost farmers as little as $10 , so even adding in the heavy cost of transporting the water in the state 's vast aqueduct system , there is room for both sides to benefit from resale of unneeded irrigation allotments . The idea had two minor drawbacks : many California farmers would sooner spread salt on their fields than surrender an acre-foot of the water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's employer , the Environmental Defense Fund , has a reputation for fighting the new water projects coveted by a lot of farmers . But Willey and E.D.F. offered to find farmers willing to sell , and the Mono Lake litigants agreed to pay for the search .
