Williams gets the maximum <P> Teamsters President Roy L. Williams , suffering from emphysema , waited attentively last week in Chicago 's U.S. District Court to be sentenced for his part in a bungled conspiracy to bribe then Senator Howard W. Cannon of Nevada . If anyone was moved by his illness , it was not U.S. District Judge Prentice H. Marshall , who slapped Williams , 68 , with a provisional maximum sentence : 55 years in prison and a fine of $29,000 . <P> Williams and four co-defendants were found guilty on Dec. 15 of conspiring to bribe Cannon by offering him choice Teamsters-owned property in Las Vegas at a $200,000 discount in return for the Senator 's help in scuttling a trucking-deregulation bill . Williams will undergo medical tests at a federal prison in Springfield , Mo. , that could lighten his sentence . He is the third president of the 1.9 million-member union to receive a prison sentence in a criminal case in the past 25 years .                 @ @ @ @
