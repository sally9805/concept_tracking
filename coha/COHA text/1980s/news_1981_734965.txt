txt HOUSTON ? At precisely 11:28 p.m . Thursday , Boston Celtics ' General Manager Red Auerbach lit his traditional victory cigar . ... and Larry Bird stole it out of his hand and blew a puff of smoke . What could be more fitting ? Because Bird blew away the Houston Rockets in the final moments of the National Basketball Association championship series at a time when it looked as if the perennial champs were going to pull a fold worthy of , say , the Philadelphia 76ers . The Celtics won the sixth game 102-91 to capture the best-of-seven series from the Rockets four games to two The Rockets ' Moses Malone ca n't make much headway against the Celtics ' Robert Parish in Thursday night 's playoff game . Malone 's plight symbolized his // Bird 's heroics lift Celtics to title . // the final two in that surge coming on a jumper by Calvin : Garrett , an old Bull reject . That cut Houston 's deficit to 84-74 , and Celtic Coach Bill Fitch called time to stem the surge . ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back-to-back jumpers to make it 84.78 Boston , and Fitch called time again . Parish finally broke a six-minute Celtic scoring drought with a looping bank shot , but two free throws by Bill Willoughby and a fast-break layup by Tom Henderson brought Houston within 86-83 . It was the closest the Rockets had been since a two-point deficit late in the first half . And Fitch , with nothing better to do , called Ain a third timeout . " I know a lot has been said about the Rockets not being a very good team ( Houston was 40.42 in the regular season ) , " said Maxwell . " But when their backs were against the wall , they fought back , and you have to give them credit for that . " " WHEN THEY CAME back at us like that , I knew that if we could keep our poise and make a couple of baskets , we 'd be all right , " said Bird , who did just that . The phlegmatic Bird drove the ' baseline , pulled up , and fired in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with 4:04 to play . Then , on defense , he stood his ground in the lane and took-a charge from Henderson , creating a turnover . Finally , he raced down the right side and fired in another 15-footer ( on Nate " Tiny " Archibald 's 12th assist ) to make it 90-83 . In other words , Bird single-handedly provided the Celtics with a six-point swing . Elapsed time : 32 seconds . Houston was n't quite finished . Garrett made two free throws ; so did Malone . And Garrett 's 15-foot jumper with 1:52 remaining again brought Houston within three , at 92-89 . By now , Bird must have been getting a little bored with the whole thing . So , he calmly wandered down into the left corner and put up a 23-footer . The shot hit nothing but net and was worth three points , boosting the Celts to a 95-89 advantage with 97 seconds to play . AND AUERBACH started reaching for his Havaaas .

It 's not the same for me now ; I 'm not coaching . But the last five charripionships ( under other coaches ) have given me a special thrill ? especially this one , considering the way we had to come back against Philadelphia in the semifinals . " " If anyone ever earned a title , we did , " said Fitch . " This will be our first night off in two years ? the two years it took us to get this championship trophy . "
