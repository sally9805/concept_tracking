Mr. Orbach , with his basset hound eyes and a new tough-guy voice , drew raves for his portrayal of Levy , the only cop who refused to squeal on his fellow detectives in the film . In his biggest scene , Mr. Orbach ' s character pushes a desk over on a Federal prosecutor who is trying to persuade him to testify against his former partners . It is a scene that almost always draws cheers from the audience. // Did Mr. Orbach , who had done very little serious dramatic acting , have any qualms about taking the role ? " I wanted it as soon as I read it , " he said . " There ' s something about a cop that is inherently bigger than life and heroic , like in the old westerns . He ' s dealing with life and death . Every day he puts a gun on in the morning and doesn ' t know if he ' ll come home at night . Whether he ' s a crooked cop or a hero cop , there ' s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Orbach said he was chosen for the part by Mr. Lumet , whom he has known over the years . " He wanted to put me in his 1968 film , ' Bye Bye , Braverman , ' but I was too young for the part , " he said . " Jack Warden wound up playing it. " // The lean , 6-foot 3-inch actor said he did very little research for the Gus Levy part , " because I ' ve known some detectives and I have sat and talked with them for many hours . I felt close to them , and I could empathize with them , so I didn ' t feel that I had to immerse myself in what they are like. " // He added that he felt that his onetime friendship with Joey Gallo , the Mafia figure who was assassinated in April 1972 as he celebrated his 43d birthday in a restaurant on Mulberry Street , also helped him to play the Levy part . " Knowing Joey as well as a lot of detectives made my background pretty complete , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gallo at a midtown restaurant several hours before his death , said he still keeps in touch with Mr. Gallo ' s mother and his family . " That ' s family without a capital F , " he said evenly . " They are very nice people. " // The actor said he had not met Leslie Wolff , the real onetime narcotics detective on whom the Gus Levy character is based . When asked about a report that Mr. Wolff never really pushed a desk onto a Federal prosecutor , Mr. Orbach said : " I ' m sure there was some license taken with what really happened . But from what I know , we were pretty close on Wolff . He was ahead of everyone in wearing Western outfits and leather jackets and cowboy boots , so that ' s why I dressed that way in the film . And he really was involved in a sting operation in the garment district , just like in the film. " // Why does Mr. Orbach think the audience applauds when Gus Levy , who is portrayed as being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Because he ' s the one guy who strikes out against the grinding , overbearing system , " he said . " The system is really the villain in the film , the overbearing system that adds on layer and layer of pressure , just like Kafka. " such good reviews in " Prince of the City , " some people are wondering why he hasn ' t done more films . In fact , one critic even wrote , " Why has Orbach been wasting his time in dumb Broadway shows all of these years ? " // " Because nobody was asking me to be in the movies , " Mr. Orbach said . One reason was that the first film he did , called " A Fan ' s Notes , " was never released in this country . The film , made in Canada , where it received favorable reviews , starred Mr. Orbach as an avid New York Giants football fan who has a series of nervous breakdowns and is in and out of mental hospitals . The cast included Burgess Meredith , Conrad Bain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Till. // Mr. Orbach ' s next film was " The Gang That Couldn ' t Shoot Straight " in 1971 , which was riddled by the critics . " It gave me a reputation as a broad , hokey actor from Broadway , " he said , " and it certainly didn ' t do anything for me in Hollywood. " // Nowadays , Mr. Orbach , who is married to Elaine Cancilla , an actress he met while they were appearing in the Broadway musical " Chicago , " is receiving about three movie scripts a week . He said he had an out-clause in his contract for " 42d Street " in case he decided to do a film. // " Judging from the scripts , I think I ' m going to be playing a lot of Jewish detectives , " he said with a smile. // In Blake Edwards ' s movie " S.O.B. , " most of the actors give portrayals that are devastating send-ups of people connected with the Hollywood film industry . Perhaps none is more devastating than that of Loretta Swit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ screeching , foulmouthed gossip columnist known as " the mouth of Hollywood. " // In the film , Miss Swit ' s character suffers a broken arm and a broken leg when she goes snooping around the beach house of a director ( played by Richard Mulligan ) who is rumored to have tried to commit suicide after his film bombed . The columnist continues her work from her hospital bed , sending out her henpecked husband , played by Craig ( " Peter Gunn " ) Stevens , to snoop for her. // Miss Swit , best known for playing Hot Lips Houlihan on the CBS television comedy series , " M*A*S*H , " said she rolled with laughter on her kitchen floor after she read the part of the gossip columnist in the " S.O.B. " script. // " I got up from the floor , called my agent and said I wanted to do it , it ' s hilarious , " she recalled . " It seemed very challenging . I had never done anything so crazy before . I loved it that she got her comeuppance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the character for me - that she was always falling or getting smashed . She was such a lunatic. " // The character of Polly Reed , she said , was based on " a conglomerate character " of five gossip columnists , none of them Rona Barrett , she said , " because this was way before Rona ' s time . " She added : " Gossip columnists are just not like Polly anymore . Those days are gone forever when they could wield that kind of power. " // Her own performance , she stressed , was not based on anyone she knew . " It was simply a fictitious character I played from a script , " she said . " The blueprint was there , and I built on it with a screaming voice and a hysteria to get a scoop . I ' ve never seen any gossip columnist act that way , because I don ' t know any of them intimately . I do have an acquaintance with Rona , and I find her quite dear. " // As Miss Swit sees it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ film industry to enjoy " S.O.B. " " It could be about any big business , like General Motors , " she said . " They all have the same machinations and the same wheeling and dealing and the same big egos . It ' s not just our industry that ' s like this. " // Miss Swit , a native of Passaic , N.J. , said she would appear in two made-for-television movies this fall , " Cagney and Lacy " on CBS , a drama in which she and Tyne Daly play policewomen , and " The Kid From Nowhere , " on NBC , a drama about youngsters afflicted with Down ' s syndrome , with Beau Bridges and Susan St. James. // On Oct. 12 she will begin her 10th season of " M*A*S*H , " for which she won an Emmy in 1980 after having been nominated six times before . She said this season would probably be her last . " I want to go on and do other things . Ten years is long enough to do any series.

" give " a remarkable special effect . " The people at Marks Polarized Corporation in Whitestone , Queens , do not deny that . They would just like the public to know that the 3-D glasses are known as Polalite 3-D viewers , patented and manufactured exclusively by Marks Polarized Corporation , and are merely assembled by the Hudson Printing Company. // Short Takes : Nancy Allen , whose last two pictures , " Dressed to Kill " and " Blow Out , " were directed by her husband , Brian De Palma , has signed to star in a film by an unrelated director .
