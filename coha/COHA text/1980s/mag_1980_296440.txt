Brezhnev blames it all on U.S. <P> <P> Moscow may have been taken aback by the worldwide condemnation of its invasion of Afghanistan , but all its trumpets of propaganda blared denial and defiance . The Afghanistan rebellion had to be suppressed , went the Kremlin line , and so the Soviet army had to suppress it . " To have acted otherwise , " said Soviet Communist Party Chief Leonid Brezhnev , " would have meant leaving Afghanistan a prey to imperialism . " Furthermore , said Brezhnev , Afghanistan was not even the cause of the current crisis . Said he : " If there were no Afghanistan , certain circles in the U.S. and in NATO would have found another pretext to aggravate the situation . " <P> Pravda elaborated on Brezhnev 's theme : " American policy is acquiring a trend that is ever more hostile to the interests of peace , detente and equitable cooperation among states . At present , this policy of interference in domestic affairs and encroachment on people 's rights is shown in relation to Iran , but tomorrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a senior writer for Izvestia , warned , " It is time for the U.S. to learn to behave with greater modesty . That will be better for both America itself and the whole world . " The man in the Moscow street often echoed his leaders ' sentiments . " Why are you pushing us around ? " asked an economics teacher . " Afghanistan is a Marxist country . " <P> While assailing the U.S. , Moscow sought to soothe other countries . Literary Gazette assured the Muslim world that although the U.S.S.R. is atheist , it is not at war with any religion . Brezhnev asserted that the Soviets want continued detente with Western Europe . <P> If there was any dissent about the invasion inside the Kremlin , it was well concealed . Despite persistent rumors that the ailing Brezhnev was not fully in command , there was no evidence that he did not make , or at least concur in , the decision to invade . Soviet Ambassador Anatoli Dobrynin , who has maintained an affable relationship with Washington policymakers for some 20 years , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is not known what he advised . Americanologist Georgi Arbatov suffered a heart attack in November and probably did not contribute to the invasion plan or an assessment of an American reaction . <P> Among Communists elsewhere , there was far less unanimity . Although the Eastern European satellite regimes generally acquiesced as supinely as ever , both Yugoslavia and Albania protested the invasion . French Communist Leader Georges Marchais , who once pretended to independence from Moscow , echoed Brezhnev in saying that the Soviets had acted only to resist an imperialist threat , but Spain 's more wayward Communists criticized the Soviet move . The Italian Communists were more rebellious . In a resolution introduced before the European Parliament in Strasbourg , Italian Communist deputies declared the invasion " an open violation of the principles of national independence and sovereignty . " The Italians ' goal , in the view of expert observers , is to win enough credibility to enable them to join in a coalition government in Rome .                  @ @ @
