' ' We are at least approaching that , ' ' says Michael Renner , a senior researcher with the Worldwatch Institute in Washington. // Similarly , the United States Arms Control and Disarmament Agency expects world spending on the military and weapons to level off if not turn down. // That agency ' s last annual survey of ' ' World Military Expenditures and Arms Transfers ' ' showed a world total for military spending of $921 billion in 1986 . A new survey , to be issued in a few weeks , will provide statistics on 1987 spending and project expenditures at least into the current year . The drop in the value of the dollar will distort the 1987 totals , probably indicating more spending . But the projections will show an end to the steady rise in real military spending ( after taking account of inflation ) that has occurred since about 1973. // // With the end of the Vietnam war , world military expenditures from 1969 to 1979 were flat , just below $600 billion in 1987 dollars . Another pause if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be of major economic significance. // Mr. Renner has just written a Worldwatch study advocating not only greater world disarmament , but use of the resources freed from such cuts for ecological and social programs. // ' ' Environmental threats with the potential to erode the habitability of the planet from beneath us are forcing humanity to consider national security in far broader terms than that guaranteed solely by force of arms , ' ' he writes. // Spending by third-world nations on the military began to decline in 1984 . The external debt crisis that began in 1982 , the decline in oil prices , and other economic factors forced many developing countries to restrain their military expenditures. // Now military spending by the superpowers has started to level out if not decline , encouraged by Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev ' s decision to switch resources from the military to his nation ' s goods-starved civilian economy. // In the US , military spending has already steadied . Former President Reagan ' s last budget called for a 2 percent increase in real military expenditures in fiscal 1990 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with that budget , it will probably show a modest decline in defense spending after inflation. // Should disarmament talks go well , further defense cuts are expected . A Congressional Budget Office study in February predicted that a talked-about withdrawal of some 15 , 000 US troops from Western Europe would save $180 million in 1990 and $2. 2 billion through 1994 . President Bush proposal to NATO leaders in Brussels calls for the withdrawal of roughly US 30 , 000 troops. // Such cuts are small relative to a defense budget of $296. 7 billion in the fiscal year ending Sept. 30 . But that could change . Renner did an earlier study showing that successful strategic arms reduction talks could save $10 billion a year if the US continued to modernize its arms in this area ; $40 billion to $45 billion if it did not modernize the arms. // Moreover , political pressure within the US to slash its military spending could grow , should the Soviet Union actually cut its expenditures. // On May 30 , Mr. Gorbachev told the Soviet parliament that military spending had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rubles ( $16. 6 billion ) . He said that the defense budget would be cut by another 10 billion rubles , or about 14 percent , in 1990-91 . That latter saving is to come from an earlier decision to reduce the size of the Soviet armed forces by 500 , 000. // During that parliamentary address , Gorbachev for the first time gave the size of Soviet military spending . The figure he gave for 1989 was 77. 3 billion rubles ( $128 billion ) , compared with the previous official budget figure of only 20. 2 billion rubles. // A US expert notes rubles buy more defense in the USSR than the official exchange rate indicates . Defense Department studies show real Soviet defense expenditures at least twice as high as $128 billion. // Any reduction in the military expenditures of the US and the Soviet Union can easily influence the world total , since their spending combined accounts for almost 60 percent of that world total. // There are other indications of a peak in world military spending . The Chinese have reduced their Army by one-third @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a truce , though both sides may be replenishing spent arms . Canada , in its latest budget , dropped plans for a fleet of nuclear submarines. // Renner argues that the heavy reliance of nations on force is actually reducing national security because the proliferation of nuclear weapons has brought every human being within the compass of instant destruction without the ability to defend against it. // ' ' At the same time , the pursuit of military power is undermining the economies of rich and poor countries alike , ' ' he writes . ' ' A large and lasting resource drain toward the military undermines economic security by retarding civilian research and development , slowing productivity growth , detracting from international competitiveness , and contributing to indebtedness. ' ' // Renner adds : ' ' It can be said that Japan is the true victor of the cold war , partly a result of the fact that since 1945 it has invested a meager 1 percent of its gross national product in the military while the superpowers were engaged in an all-out arms race. ' ' // He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not include the preservation of livable conditions within a country - or on the planet as a whole . ' ' Increasingly , countries are finding their security undermined by environmental threats emanating from other nations , such as pollutants flowing across their frontier through the air or water , or cataclysmic floods unleashed by denuded watersheds far from their borders . On a global scale , climate change , ozone depletion , deterioration of the agricultural base , and deforestation are formidable challenges to the safety and well-being of the entire race. ' ' // Renner offers a table of what the cost of various military projects would buy in the way of environmental projects . For example , the $100 billion spent on the Trident 2 submarine and F-16 jet fighter programs would pay for the cleanup cost for the 3 , 000 worst hazardous waste dumps in the US . The $68 billion Stealth bomber program would cover two-thirds of the estimated costs of meeting US clean-water goals by the year 2000 . Approximately four days of global military spending would pay for a five-year action plan to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has spent an estimated $17. 5 trillion for military purposes since World War II ( in 1987 dollars ) . The world ' s armed forces are some 29 million-strong , with an estimated 16 million additional people employed in the world ' s arms industries . Paramilitary forces probably number another 10 million. // Twenty-two wars have been fought in the 1980s , more than in any previous decade in modern political history , notes Renner . Some 120 armed conflicts since 1945 - most of them in developing countries - have killed at least 20 million people. // At the same time , aggression has become less successful , he says . In this century , aggressors have won only four out of 10 wars ; in the ' 80s , that share is down to one out of 10 . Regardless of the outcome of these wars , the prime victims of these wars have been civilians . They accounted for 52 percent of all deaths in the 1950s ; by the ' 80s , their share had grown to 85 percent. // The greatest number of armed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In many cases , says Renner , the armed forces are an important instrument for preserving political and economic structures that deny basic needs and opportunities to the majority of people in a nation. // Renner sees the political changes in the communist nations as offering ' ' exciting ' ' possibilities for reducing the military. // The traditional concept of ' ' national security ' ' has become an outmoded concept , he writes . ' ' Security is increasingly attained through the difficult process of global cooperation to create mechanisms for nonviolent dispute settlement and establish environmental alliances .
