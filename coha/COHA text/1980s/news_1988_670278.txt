NEW YORK  --  Consumer confidence fell sharply in September , the largest monthly decline since just after last October ' s stock-market crash . The Conference Board ' s confidence index dropped 10. 7 points to 109 in September , compared with a revised 119. 7 in August . The seasonally adjusted index uses 1985 as a base of 100 . The September index was down 6. 7 points from the year-earlier level of 115. 7 . In November 1987 , a month after the crash , the index dropped 14. 3 points to 100. 8 . " It is still too early to say what may have shaken consumer confidence in September , " said Fabian Linden , executive director of the board ' s Consumer Research Center . " Although a single month ' s reading is inconclusive , the decline in confidence is too large and widespread to be dismissed as merely a technical aberration . The latest economic statistics , showing personal income rising only about half as fast as prices , may well have caused some consumer uneasiness . Still , the present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recession . " All sections of the country registered downturns in confidence about the present economic scene as well as expectations about the future situation in the Board ' s September survey , which is conducted by National Family Opinion Inc . , Toledo , Ohio . The Conference Board is an industry-supported , nonprofit economic research group . " One of the purposes of the consumer confidence survey is that it gives warning signals , " Mr. Linden said . " We ' re getting warning signals . " The only positive thing about the latest survey , Mr. Linden said was that the index stood above a recession ' s " historical trigger level " of about 80 . " We ' re still well above a disaster level . " In the October survey , which will be released in November , a drop of " anything over five points would certainly be disconcerting , " he added . Mr. Linden said he took the latest survey " a little more seriously " in the wake of September ' s National Association of Purchasing Management ' s recently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ companies ' expected level of business . Other economic forecasters also have suggested a slowdown by the end of the year . In its October forecast , Data Resources Inc. , for example , noted that at times during the first half of this year , " consumers were encouraged to spend by very rapid employment gains , lower mortgage rates , and various auto incentive programs . " The Lexington , Mass. , forecasting concern added , " From here on , though , spending growth is likely to be much more moderate , " because of slowing employment . In addition , " rising interest rates and an upward creep in consumer prices " will slow spending and boost personal savings . In January , the Conference Board said about 50% of consumers expected higher interest rates in the future . In April that was up to about 58% . In subsequent months that expectation slipped back a bit , but since July has been about 75% of those surveyed . A large percentage of new mortgage loans are adjustable-rate , which would lead those homeowners to worry more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Expectations of higher inflation also have risen . In the spring , the generally expected level of inflation was about 4% ; that has since increased to about 4. 9% . In September , only 27. 9% of the 5 , 000 U.S. households surveyed considered the current business conditions " good , " down from 32. 2% in August . Some 29. 1% said jobs are plentiful , compared with 32. 3% in August . Only 18. 4% expect the conditions to improve during the next six months , down from 21. 4% the previous month . Buying plans also were down in September , with home-purchase plans registering an especially sharp drop-off . Of those surveyed , 3% said they plan to buy a home in the next six months , down from a " sturdy " 4. 2% in August , the Board said . Auto-purchase plans , which have already slipped from levels earlier in the year , were little changed in September at 7. 4% . Plans to buy major appliances fell to 28. 9% from 34. 3% the month before . In September , fewer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next six months , 23. 4% compared with 27. 4% in August . Also , an increase in job openings during the period was expected by 16. 8% of consumers in September , down from 19% the previous month . A Conference Board survey conducted immediately after the stock-market crash in October showed that confidence fell slightly 0. 6 point to 115. 1 from the previous month . Given a month to digest fallout from the crash , however , consumers were much less confident and the index skidded 14. 3 points . In contrast , during the 1973 oil crisis , the index dropped more than one-third . By February this year , the Board said consumers had regained almost all of the confidence in the economy they lost following the stock-market crash . The index fell a bit in March , after three months of gains . The index proceeded to rise to an 18year high in May , hitting a level of 120. 2 . But in June and July , reflecting a downturn in confidence among the nation ' s drought-stricken farm regions and expectations of higher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , about 72% of consumers anticipated higher interest rates . The index rose in August as the drought eased . Credit : Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal
