Considering the fickleness of the American palate and the competition for food dollars , it is no wonder that 1986 saw so many trendy flashes in the pan , as well as on the plate . California and Southwest cuisines , so much in vogue last January , have already begun to pall . As the year ended , lip service was being paid to such buzz words as country , peasant , cuisine bourgeoise and even meat and potatoes . Meanwhile , freshness took on new meaning as lazy cooks opted for unfrozen , simmer-in-bag prepared dishes . And with rabbit the In meat of the year , the most worried of all perhaps is Bugs Bunny , who now faces a fate more dire than any conjured up by Elmer Fudd . <P> HOTTEST NEWS The bistro . The food world seems to concur that this traditional favorite is back in style , but there is little agreement about what the word means . To some it stands for eateries serving such traditional French fare as coq au vin , pot-au-feu and gigot . To others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food , much of it indistinguishable from California cuisine . Symbolic of the confusion is the representation in a new book , American Bistro , by Irena Chalmers and Friends ( Contemporary ; $35 ) . Cited are Kansas City 's high-style American Restaurant and the posh , pricey Mansion on Turtle Creek in Dallas . Even included is the Ballroom in Manhattan , known for its Spanish tapas . Everything , it seems , is in a name . <P> DREARIEST WAVE OF THE FUTURE The domestically produced , vacuum-sealed bags that hold appetizers and main courses and are available at Bloomingdale 's in New York City and have more recently been introduced at Marshall Field 's in Chicago leave almost everything to be desired in flavor and texture . Based on tastings of a dozen or so choices ( omelet creole , lobster bisque , ravioli with snails , poached salmon and pork with apricots ) , these generally expensive creations , with main courses from $2.25 for pasta to $12.90 for veal , are a cut above airline food . <P> MOST PROLIFIC AND IMAGINATIVE RESTAURANT DESIGNER Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that some of the most noteworthy are the creations of a would-be stage-set designer , Paris-born Sam Lopata . Taking New York City as his backdrop , Lopata , 45 , has unveiled some half-dozen eateries in the past year alone , each in a distinctive style . Foremost among them are the reserved restoration of the haute cuisine Lutece ; the playful deli-diner that is Lox Around the Clock ; Casino Pascal , a barren redo of a plusher , earlier Lopata work ; and Extra ! Extra ! , in the New York Daily News Building , a stylish cafe with a black-and-white newsprint theme and " spilled ink " glazed onto floor tiles . On the drawing board for next year : a face- lifting for that theater-district landmark , Sardi 's . <P> COFFEE-TABLE FOOD BOOK OF THE YEAR If the recipes do not work , you can always eat the pages of the year 's most beautiful , lavishly illustrated cookbook , Roger Verge 's Entertaining in the French Style ( Stewart , Tabori &; Chang ; $45 ) .
