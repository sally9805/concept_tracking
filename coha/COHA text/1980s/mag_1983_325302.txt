The budget struggle begins anew with disputes over defense and jobs <P> " Nothing is certain but death , taxes and congressional cuts in the defense budget , " proclaimed Republican Senator John Warner of Virginia , a former Navy Secretary . Actually , in the budget battle that began last week , the question of taxes is very much a matter of uncertainty . But military spending has already become a blazing battleground that promises to produce some cuts and much political bleeding . <P> Armed with red , white and blue charts detailing the Soviet military threat , Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger marched up to Capitol Hill to erect a defiant rampart around his $239 billion share of the $848 billion budget . After three days of crossfire from Congressmen of both parties , the Iron Duke of Defense emerged battered but unbending . " We simply can not reduce defense spending any further without undermining the security of the United States , " he adamantly declared . <P> The skirmishing on defense was the opening round in the struggle between Congress and the Reagan Administration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which begins in October . The President has proposed a spending " freeze " that will in fact reduce funds for some programs for the poor , such as food stamps and child nutrition , by about 8% , while boosting the defense budget by 14% . But lawmakers on both sides of the aisle are loath to make further cuts in programs for the poor . Moreover , there is considerable bipartisan support for a public works jobs program to stimulate employment . Predicted Republican Congressman Silvio Conte of Massachusetts : " There will be a hell of a shift from defense to social programs , no doubt about it . " <P> Republicans pleaded with Weinberger for help in making the inevitable excisions . " The worst thing we can do is dig in our heels , " warned Senator Dan Quayle of Indiana . But Weinberger 's rigidity was reinforced by the President himself , who dispatched a statement to his beleaguered Defense Secretary advising him to tell Congress that " we have reached the bone and that any further cuts would do severe damage to our national @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with their own suggestions . Warner proposed reducing the size of the armed forces by up to 7% . Senate Budget Committee Chairman Pete Domenici of New Mexico argued that military spending could be cut by 5% , bringing it down to the growth rate put forward by Reagan two years ago . Slade Gorton of Washington suggested freezing defense spending at the fiscal 1983 level , $209 billion . <P> The Democrats ' attack on the defense budget was even harsher . Senator Edward Kennedy badgered Weinberger to say whether America 's armed forces could defend the U.S. When Weinberger replied that the country 's current power to deter attack is not " sufficient , " the Massachusetts Senator declared , " You are the first Secretary of Defense to appear and say we are unprepared and vulnerable . " Weinberger told Kennedy : " You still have a propensity not to listen . " The Democratic barrage culminated when Senator Donald Riegle of Michigan called Weinberger " an ideologue " and " a fanatic " who was " damaging the national defense . " Weinberger labeled Riegle 's tirade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
