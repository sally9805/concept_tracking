That was the boldly lettered message confronting me on the local supermarket bulletin board . It went on to proclaim the virtues of a group of young artists who had banded together to do odd jobs in the neighborhood , such as cleaning and painting apartments , moving furniture , walking dogs , shopping for shut-ins , and baby-sitting. // It ended with the declaration that anyone hiring these young artists would not only get good service for their money , but would also know that they had made a small but significant contribution to the future of American art. // Two things in particular struck me about that notice : It stressed that these were artists who were offering their services for hire , and there was the assumption that the public would hire them because they were artists , and thus worthy of preferential treatment. // This assumption is increasingly being proved correct . For the first time in as long as I can remember , the young artist ( or even the older one struggling for creative or professional identity ) is beginning to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at large  --  and not merely as a nuisance , an alien creature , or a failure at occupations that really matter. // Not that this perception of the artist is universal by any means . Nor that every community is as aware as others of the artists in their midst or of their contributions . ( The bulletin board mentioned above happens to be in the very art-conscious Upper West Side of Manhattan  --  hardly a typical American community ! ) Even so , it does represent a general improvement in how the as-yet-not-successful artist is perceived in this country today. // At the same time , I wonder if the artist is any better understood today than he was 25 or 50 years ago . Or if this greater acceptance hasn ' t resulted from much greater media coverage ( leading to greater curiosity about art ) - and from the stories circulating about the money a successful or even nearly successful artist can make . It is fairly common knowledge , after all , that there are a dozen or so recent American painters and sculptors who became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least a dozen more whose annual income runs into the mid-to-high six figures. // When we consider that , even taking inflation into account , no American painter or sculptor before 1960 came anywhere near making that much money from art ( the possible exceptions being Sargent and Chase at the turn of the century ) , we must come to the conclusion that a significant change has recently taken place in the American art world. // To a considerable extent , this is due to this country ' s remarkable dominance in world art from roughly 1950 to the present . Although there is evidence that this dominance has peaked and is now on the decline , some elements of American art during that period proved totally irresistible to a succession of foreign museums , collectors , and investors . They bought consistently , and they bought a great deal. // American collectors and investors followed suit , and by the late-1960s a painting by Arshile Gorky , Clyfford Still , Willem de Kooning , or Hans Hofmann was seen , in some quarters , much less as art than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if it weren ' t so sad . The prices for works of the fashionably famous contemporary painters and sculptors skyrocketed , to the point where even some mediocre examples now equal  --  and in some instances exceed  --  the prices for acknowledged masterpieces of the distant and recent past . And if that weren ' t insane enough , attempts are now being made to grade , in print , contemporary artists according to their investment potential , by how likely one or another is to jump dramatically in ' ' value ' ' from one year to the next. // I can not think of anything more ridiculous and beside the point of art . If this goes on , we ' ll soon be visiting galleries with a handicap sheet in one hand and the latest ' ' art market ' ' quotations in the other  --  and will buy art over the phone from an ' ' art broker ' ' much as we now buy stocks and bonds. // I can see it now : Art students will study Market Research as they learn how to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and charting particularly successful art sales . Degrees will be awarded for predictability studies , and for research into what colors and shapes are the most commercially successful. // Far-fetched ? Not at all . In fact , in some ways we aren ' t so far away from that already . At least that ' s the impression I get from a goodly number of recent art school and university art department graduates who have made it to New York . No theological student ever pored over his Bible more devotedly than did these youngsters over all issues of all art magazines during their student days . And no rock-music or film fan ever tried to get closer to his hero than do these young artists once they hit New York. // As a result , their knowledge of who and what is ' ' in ' ' in the art world is frighteningly accurate - as is their assessment of their elders ' careers ; the advisability of joining a particular gallery , movement , or ' ' ism ' ' ; which influential artist , curator , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ careers ; and , most important , how to put their own art more in line with what is considered most up-and-coming or most likely-to-succeed among the current styles. // This kind of calculation is not new . Something like it has taken place every time bright young talent has had to compete for limited position or prestige . What is new , however , is the way this private ambition is beginning to fuse with a public conception of art which sees it , at least partly , as an investment commodity. // I ' m particularly concerned about the effect all this will have upon the thousands of art students throughout the country . Will they fall victim to the increasing cynicism of certain facets of the art world they read about in the art magazines . Or will they find the means and the support to survive and strike off on their own ? // An informal poll I ' ve taken among various galleries - and my own observation - suggest that youngsters coming to New York to show their work to dealers , or to start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the art world as it is as ever before . And they are just as willing to do whatever is deemed necessary to win the approval of those in positions of influence . ( This , of course , does not apply to those artists for whom art is a strictly private and profoundly significant commitment. // But then , it ' s so much easier , after all , to give over uncritically to a powerful and popular force  --  or to accept the status quo  --  than to remain independent , to find and bring out what is unique and valuable within oneself . And it is particularly difficult for a young artist to discover his creative identity in a place where glamour , peer approval , success , and sensationalism all compete for his attention. // Even so , things have improved somewhat over the past few years . Whatever their public image may be - and whatever they have to do in the way of menial or non-art work to survive - our younger artists have a sense of purpose I didn ' t sense to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roughly the same age 20 and 25 years ago. // That might not seem like much , but considering all they will have to put up with , both creatively and competitively , over the next few years , it ' s quite a lot . It might also make a long-range difference in the shaping of future American art by helping it pull itself out of the swamp of opportunism and self-serving sensationalism it has stumbled into of late . But whatever happens , and whatever form the art of the near and distant future takes , the emerging American artist will have earned position of greater respect in his community than has been the case up to now. // That is , he will if he doesn ' t blow his chances by falling victim to the notion that art can be created strictly for commercial or ' ' investment ' ' purposes , or for reasons that are culturally and personally trivial . Or if he fails to understand that a culture and a society have the right to demand art from its artists , regardless of what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
