On a Wednesday back in July , Roberto Rodriguez was headed out the door of United Beef Co. in South Boston for what he thought was his regular 9 a.m. coffee break . United ' s plant manager , Stephen Schwartz , was standing near the company ' s broken time clock and told Rodriguez it wasn ' t 9 o ' clock yet . An argument broke out . Company officials claim Rodriguez spit at Schwartz and uttered a profanity . Rodriguez claims he never spit at Schwartz and that Schwartz roughed him up . Whatever the cause , Schwartz fired Rodriguez . When he left , his fellow workers on the blood-spattered meat-cutting line put down their knives and their meat hooks and went with him . Some claim they thought they also had been fired . Others clearly walked off their jobs in support of Rodriguez , their union shop steward . Negotiations between company and union officials failed to resolve the dispute . So the company took the opportunity to invoke the no-strike clause in its labor contract and fired 93 people . Workers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business ground to a halt and the issue went to arbitration . At most other times and in most other industries , a spat over a coffeebreak might have been settled quickly and forgotten . But in the competitive meat-packing business , companies say they can ' t afford to compromise any longer , even on minor labor issues . They say restrictive contracts and high labor costs are threatening the survival of their businesses . Joel Miller , vice president at United Beef , says the golden goose that once laid some of the highest hourly wages in the country is dead . " It was decapitated , " he says . The time is past when meat cutters could negotiate higher and higher wages , he says . Now they must decide if they want jobs at all . " You ' re not talking about the Brady Bunch here , " Miller says . " And this isn ' t the 11 o ' clock news where everyone looks like they ' re earning $400,000 a year . That ' s not the real world . This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the table one of the projectiles he says the union used to puncture the tires of his trucks . After 11 weeks of stalemate , the arbitrator in the United case sided with the company and affirmed the mass firing . But unlike many meat companies today , United did not take advantage of the ruling to bust its union , though it did use it to cut costs substantially . The company sat down with officials of Local 592 of the United Food and Commercial Workers Union and agreed to recognize it as the workers ' official bargaining agent . It also agreed to rehire as many of its former workers as possible . But for most of them their 10 , 15 and 20 years of experience are being erased . They are slowly being rehired as new employees and paid $3 to $5 less per hour . " It ' s a question of survival , " says United ' s owner , Paul Miller . " It ' s a question of coming together so both sides ( management and labor* can survive . " John Danizio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United case was a bitter pill to swallow . But he says at least United was willing to talk . At many other companies , he says , the companies are treating their workers no better than the slabs of meat they have hanging in the refrigerated back room . The survival rate for both unions and companies has not been high since the early 1960s , when a company called Iowa Beef Processors began cutting its costs by building assembly-line slaughtering plants near farmers and shipping beef cuts ( not whole carcasses full of bones and fat ) to markets across the country . The company also disregarded the so-called master contract most beef companies negotiated with the United Food and Commercial Workers Union . That action spawned strike after strike , but Iowa Beef almost always won . With the union unable to stop Iowa Beef , many companies were forced out of business as they found themselves priced out of the market . Others used complex legal maneuvers to void contracts . Wilson Foods Corp. , which blamed high labor costs for a $42.9 million loss last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ widely seen as an attempt to break its union contract . Here in the Northeast , Federal Beef Co. is the latest meat- packer to go out of business . A spokesman blamed the firm ' s planned closing this Friday on high labor costs and the fact that three of the company ' s major suppliers went out of business in the last year . This industry shakeout is taking a terrible toll on members of the United Food and Commercial Workers Union . Local 592 has seen its membership cut in half in the last seven years , and few have been able to find work at comparable pay . Federal Beef ' s closing will cost another 13 union members their jobs . And another 150 are at stake in a bitter strike at Columbia Packing Co. in Roxbury . Columbia , manufacturer of Gem products , had been in financial trouble for several years . Its union in 1981 agreed to a wage reduction of $1.40 an hour to help keep the company afloat . But losses continued to mount and , like Wilson Foods , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ court in February . Early in September word leaked out that Columbia was negotiating to sell out . One of the potential buyers was Colonial Provision Co. , the region ' s largest meat company located blocks away on Southampton street . Two union officials say they met with Jack Satter , Colonial ' s owner , and talked about the possibility of wage concessions . The meeting ended with the union agreeing to continue the discussions if Satter purchased Columbia . But Satter was not willing to buy the company without some sort of guarantee on wage concessions , so he pulled out of the negotiations . On Sept. 16 , Columbia officially went out of business . It then was bought by Agar Supply Co. for $1.1 million . Agar , a nonunion meat distributor located in Roxbury , claims it bought a building and machinery and not Local 592 . It refuses to deal with the union and is hiring new workers at rates of $5 to $8.50 an hour , about half the union wage . Angry union members have responded by setting up picket lines , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Columbia products . Union and company officials say there have been scuffles at the site and one union member has been arrested . Albert J. Letizio , vice president of Agar , says he treats his workers fairly . " We don ' t need a union to protect the guys that don ' t want to work , " he says . He also maintains that if Agar had not bought Columbia 150 jobs would have been lost for good . Union members walking the picket lines say all they wanted was to sit down and talk with company officials . Ernie Campos , a meat slicer with 23 years of experience at Columbia , says he did not expect to retain his seniority or even the same wage he had been getting . All he wanted to do was talk about a possible deal . " But they didn ' t even give us that common decency , " he said . Members of Local 616 , another United Food and Commercial Workers local that represents employees at Colonial , are spending their lunch hours in front of Columbia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ succeeds in paying its workers half the union scale Satter will demand the same at Colonial . " When is it going to stop ? " asks 52-year-old Vinnie Petrillo , one of the many victims of the shakeout in the meat business . Petrillo worked as a meat trimmer for Columbia Packing Co. for 30 1/2 years . He has a high school education and a craftsman ' s pride . He recalls times when his hands were covered with blood and so numb from the cold that he ' d have to bang them on a work bench to revive the circulation . Petrillo was earning $10.09 an hour when Columbia went out of business . Now he feels degraded and walks a picket line outside . He asks questions that economists and business school professors have been unable to answer . " Where do people like us go ? " he asks . " At my age , who wants to hire me ? Am I supposed to go down to Papa Gino ' s and work for $3.80 an hour ? Who ' s going to pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How do I put my son through college ? " I ' m going to be here for as long as it takes to get these people to sit down and recognize that we are people . "
