South Florida is swamped by refugee needs-and violence <P> In the spring of 1980 , when thousands of Cubans were mobbing the port city of Mariel for their helter-skelter exodus to the shores of Florida , President Fidel Castro denounced the emigrants as escoria ( scum ) . As if to ensure that he was at least partly correct , Castro added some convicts and mental patients to the Mariel horde . Indeed , of the 125,000 " Marielitos " who landed in Florida , 1,709 have been jailed by federal authorities as undesirables , and 587 more have been locked up until they can find sponsors . Nearly all the rest have settled in Dade County , which includes Miami . The great majority of Marielitos are peaceful and eager for work . But a number of hardcore criminals- true escoria who slipped through the screening process-have brought a plague of murder , rape and robbery on south Florida . <P> Miami may soon become the violent crime capital of the nation , with rates for major crimes at least doubling since 1979 . In the past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ homicide ; an additional 72 of their own number have been murdered . Florida Governor Bob Graham claims that half of all violent crimes in Miami today are committed by Marielitos and that the refugees represent 20% to 30% of the city 's jail population . <P> The crimes Marielitos commit are sometimes remarkable for their viciousness . Says Lieut . Robert Murphy , head of the Miami police department 's homicide unit : " One of them killed two victims , one with a lead pipe , the other by stomping him to death with his feet . Marielitos shot at an eleven-year-old boy simply because he was a witness to a robbery . These criminals have a ruthlessness without any parallel that I 've ever seen . " The refugees who go wrong tend to be slight young men , gaunt and hollow-eyed , who dress in sneakers , jeans and T shirts . Many wear tattoos advertising their criminal specialties : Madre engraved on a small heart for a hit man , a falling star for a kidnapper . Dade County Medical Examiner Joe Davis last month denounced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guys are not even human . They 're animals . Not even animals . That 's an insult to the animal kingdom . " The murder boom has filled existing morgue space ; Davis rented a refrigerated hamburger van to accommodate the overflow . <P> Miami 's 500,000 earlier Cuban immigrants , most of whom are now well assimilated , are growing increasingly hostile to the new arrivals . The term Marielito itself has become a fighting word in " Little Havana , " the teeming , prosperous Cuban community in Miami ; there are bumper stickers proclaiming NO ME DIGAS MARIELITO ( Do n't Call Me a Marielito ) . Says Bernardo Benes , a Cuban-mgr banker : " When I see Marielitos , I see numbers on them like the Jews in the concentration camps . There is a terrible lack of compassion for these people .
