Soul Rocker Michael Jackson 's No. 1 Thriller may sell 9 million copies by the end of the year . David Bowie 's Let 's Dance has moved 1 million in just three months , and Synchronicity , the latest album by the Police , has sold 2 million in less than a month . <P> From 1979 until just a few months ago , many of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ records and tapes , were spending their money in video arcades instead of the stores .

Their impact has gone far beyond promotional gimmickry . Says PolyGram 's Kiernan , whose group Def Leppard went platinum after TV exposure : " You can feel the sales right away . " <P> Costing an average $35,000 to produce , the three-to five-minute clips on Music @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bits . Now they accompany almost every album and are often mini-epics . Michael Jackson 's Beat It is a $150,000 , five-minute West Side Story , in which the singer flashdances through a cast of 80 gang members ( most of them real Los Angeles street dudes ) and 60 scenes to avert a showdown .
