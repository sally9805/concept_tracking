Many pianists , relying on their own ears and artistic intuition , have refused to accept the umbrella-tip thesis , no matter how unassailable the data . They sullenly insist that Arthur Rubinstein could play any note more beautifully than any scientist ' s umbrella. // The debate surfaced again this month in The Musical Times , the British journal , when Nicholas Temperley , a faculty member at the University of Illinois , fired off a salvo at an article by Alexander Abercrombie . Mr. Abercrombie had shrugged off as " superstition " the contention that a pianist can not influence the tone of his instrument " independent of volume , pedalling and timing . " He held that " simple acoustical observations show that the tone of a note is preponderantly influenced by its mode of onset or attack . " Most pianists probably would line up behind him instinctively , no matter what the sine-wave generators might testify. // However , Mr. Temperley pointed out that carefully controlled studies done in the 30 ' s by H.C. Hart , M.W. Fuller and W.S. Lusby , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , upheld the umbrella-tip theory . When pianists tried to play a note with extreme opposites of tone , the wave forms their efforts generated could in each instance be matched by a mechanical striker , simply by altering the speed of the strike . Mr. Temperley then goes on to make a fascinating statement : " ' Acoustical observations , ' simple or otherwise , can measure a physical sound , but they can not measure what is perceived . " This , obviously , leaves a gap through which any musical mystic could drive a grand piano . What science is telling us , it seems , is that it can measure sounds as they register on electronic instruments but can not take the human ear or other senses into consideration when computing the results. // It should not be surprising , considering the importance of the question and the poetic manner in which musicians have always tended to ask and answer it , that even the experts do not agree on what tone is or how it may be varied . I recently looked through a dozen or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that most hardly confront the issue at all . Some do not mention tone except as the American alternative for note , as in quarter-tone or 12-tone . When piano tone is referred to it is often wrapped confusingly into discussions of " touch , " which concerns the technical methods used in varying articulation and tone , but does not deal with the essence of tone itself . Piano tone , in this sort of functional definition , is what touch produces. // The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians , in its section on Piano Playing , skims quickly over the subject , as if fearful of getting involved . It mentions the usual " unassailable " scientific evidence and the probability that piano tone depends on " how notes are related in chord or melodic line . " The previous edition of Grove was less inclined to bend its knee to science . While admitting the validity of the umbrella thesis as concerning the playing of a single note , it got positively snappish : " . . . it is obvious to anyone but a scientist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with science , that as soon as a number of notes are played in succession , problems of phrasing arise , and that two or more notes played together raise questions of chording - both phrasing and chording being matters of ' touch ' . " // At any rate , pianists have gone right on talking and acting as if tone were something over which the best of them have exquisite control . For an up-to-the-minute example , turn to Gyorgy Sandor ' s " On Piano Playing , " published this season by Schirmer . Mr. Sandor begins a chapter devoted to " Singing Tone " with a defense of the piano ' s honor : " Nobody doubts its ability to graduate dynamics , but some often question its ability to vary tone quality . Is it capable of responding to changes of touch , and , if so , how do we achieve this ? First , let me assure you that the piano is indeed responsive to various touches , and it can produce a singing tone , as anyone who has heard the varied piano @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // Most books on piano playing do not even raise the issue but simply instruct the student in how to produce nuanced tones , as if nobody doubted it could be done . Josef Lhevinne , in his book on technique , devotes a chapter to " The Secret of a Beautiful Tone " in which he contends that the key must be " touched with as large a surface on the first joint of the finger as feasible . " The " singing , ringing tone " is further enhanced by a wrist " so loose that it sinks below the level of the keyboard. " // Walter Gieseking ' s instruction book contends that a singing tone depends on muscle relaxation and a steady pressure on the keys rather than striking them with arched fingers . Gerald D ' Abreu ' s " Playing the Piano with Confidence " says " it is common knowledge that muscular tension is responsible for harshness of sound . " He makes the important point , generally overlooked by most teachers and students , that " the piano is capable of yielding the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be imagined . " Here , at least , the scientist and the piano mystic may find common ground : beautiful tone originates in the head of the performer and not in the finger , the wrist , the forearm , the shoulder or any other section of the anatomy . If you can ' t imagine it , you can ' t produce it. // In looking through my own sprawling library of piano methods and instruction books I was struck by a peculiar fact . The more clearly amateur the book in its thrust and purpose , the less mention there was of tone . A couple of otherwise excellent books for the amateur , Charles Cooke ' s " Playing the Piano for Pleasure " and Mervyn Bruxton ' s " Mastering the Piano : A Guide for the Amateur " totally ignore the matter , perhaps in the belief that a person can learn to play the piano fluently and later add beautiful tone . This is the same thinking that leads some amateurs - and a few professionals - to believe that after a piece is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like sugar in coffee. // Unfortunately , nobody has yet succeeded entirely in solving the mystery of what makes one pianist ' s tone beautiful and the next one ' s ugly . Some of the effect may be psychological or even visual . Arthur Rubinstein ' s onetime piano technician and page turner , Steven Borrell , once told me how he had learned the secret of the Rubinstein pounce - the dramatic maneuver in which the great pianist would actually rise from the bench and bring his hands crashing down on the keys , without producing a hard or glassy tone . Sitting so close , Mr. Borrell was able to observe that the pianist ' s fingers would not land on the keys with uninterrupted speed but would pause almost imperceptibly a millisecond before impact . The sound was rich and cushioned , but the effect was even more startling because the eye had led the ear to expect a brutal crash. // No doubt science will get to the bottom of all this in time . No doubt , too , most musicians will go right on believing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forget that this country is now awash in mediocre or worthless concert halls that acoustical science designed , almost invariably without consulting musicians . Something about tone , at any rate , will always remain a little mysterious . Here is what Benno Moiseiwitsch once said about his teacher , Theodor Leschetizky : // " Above all , there was his tone . No one had a tone like his . He never taught us any ' secret ' there ; one just picked up something of the luster from him. " // So , grant that scientists are right about the umbrella-tip theory . We ' ll keep right on listening for the luster. //
