A U.S. bill stings a neighbor <P> Every evening in Tijuana , scores of young men gather in an abandoned soccer field , hoping for a chance to cross the border into California . A lone U.S. Border Patrol officer blocks their passage during the day , and so the Mexicans wait for nightfall , when they can slip silently through the shadows . But over the past week they have been looking beyond the Border Patrol at a more threatening obstacle to their hope of finding jobs in the U.S. : the passage by Congress of the Simpson-Mazzoli immigration bill . <P> If finally passed into law , Simpson-Mazzoli would make it harder for Mexicans and other job seekers from Latin America to enter the U.S. illegally . Although the bill would ultimately grant permanent residency to many of those already in the U.S. illegally , new border crossers would find it much tougher to find jobs because employers of more than three such workers would be liable for fines of up to $2,000 for each so-called illegal they hire . The men who wait in Tijuana @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inhibit employers from hiring them as long as there is a need for workers . " In the U.S. , as in Mexico , laws are made to be bent , " says one . Even so , the men are worried . The bill , they say , would give U.S. employers an excuse to pay them less than they do now , because of the risks involved in hiring illegal immigrants . <P> Resentment of the U.S. action was evident throughout Mexico last week , as a congressional conference committee prepared to iron out differences in how the bill should be implemented . A relatively open border with the U.S. has long been taken for granted as a safety valve for the 50% of Mexico 's workers who are without jobs or are underemployed . Thus Simpson-Mazzoli is seen not as immigration reform but as an act of aggression against Mexico . In Mexico City , the Ministry of Foreign Relations said that because of the bill , the government would have to increase its vigilance over abuses of Mexican citizens in the U.S. The reaction in the Mexican @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us by the U.S. , " wrote Gonzalo Martre in the Mexico City daily El Universal , " has wounded our national honor . " Gilberto Herrera , another columnist , accused the U.S. of being a bad neighbor and of forgetting how Mexican laborers came to the assistance of U.S. agriculture in World War II . Other press critics complained about Washington 's refusal to ease trade restrictions while Mexico suffers its most severe economic crisis since the Depression , making it harder for Mexico to sell its products in U.S. markets . <P> Jesus Gonzalez Schmal , secretary for international relations of the National Action Party , the leading opposition party in Mexico , predicted that passage of Simpson-Mazzoli would mean increased social tensions in northern Mexico and in the central states of Jalisco and Zacatecas . Many illegal immigrants in the U.S. come from these areas . Jose Luis Perez Canchola , head of the Unified Socialist Party 's Border Affairs Commission , warned that if the law resulted in greater numbers of Mexicans being deported , social services in border towns like Tijuana would be severely strained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
