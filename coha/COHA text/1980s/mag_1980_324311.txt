As the economy sinks , Reagan and Carter jostle over 1980 ' s first issue <P> It is one of the oldest traditions in politics for the governing party to cut taxes in an election year , but this year , the Carter Administration vowed , that would not happen . Absolutely not , declared Jimmy Carter . Absolutely not , vowed Treasury Secretary G. William Miller . Absolutely not , echoed Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker . The great problem was inflation , the Administration said throughout the spring , and that required a balanced budget , and no tax cut . " I will not consider any reduction in taxes , " said Carter last March , " until I am convinced that the 1981 budget will be balanced . " <P> By last week , with the recession now crunching up the economy and the election drawing ever nearer , the Administration made it clear that it was changing its mind . Alfred Kahn , the President 's chief inflation counselor , was characteristically blunt . Said he : " Nobody doubts that a tax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on it : $20 billion to $25 billion , perhaps more . <P> While the Administration moved toward yet another policy shift , however , the Republicans seized the issue that they have been promoting for months . Ronald Reagan , the all but certain Republican nominee for President , called a press conference in Los Angeles and announced that he and the Republican leaders in Congress would fight for a $36 billion tax cut to take effect on Jan. 1 . As a result of President Carter 's economic policies , said Reagan , " production lines are being idled , factory gates are closing across the land , and housing construction has gone into a tailspin . " <P> The G.O.P. Senators decided that they would try to attach the tax-cutting measure to every major finance bill that came to a vote on Capitol Hill . The very next day , they did just that , proposing an amendment on a bill to raise the federal debt limit . The Democrats had the strength to beat back the tax cutters on a straight party-line vote , 58 to 38 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embarrassment . Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd denounced the Republican maneuvering as a " Tinkertoy economic solution " and " a con game with the American people . " To head off more such votes , he called on the Senate Finance Committee to draw up its own tax-cutting measure by Labor Day . But since the Administration is due to produce a revision of the planned budget by July 15 , some Democrats were urging that Carter come out with his own tax-cutting plans as early as next week . <P> So , while everyone suddenly seemed to agree with Kahn 's prediction that a tax cut is " inevitable , " no one could agree on what size it should be or what form it should take . Reagan 's plan called for a straight 10% reduction on individual returns . For a family of four with a median annual income of about $20,000 , this would mean a tax saving of $227 next year . Reagan also called for faster tax write-offs for business investments , allowing a company to deduct from its taxes the cost of new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and new light trucks and cars over three years . The Democratic leadership is considering a rebate on next year 's scheduled increase of $17 billion in Social Security taxes and speeding up tax write-offs for business .
