One of the last remaining executives recruited to the Chicago Transit Authority by the CTA ' s " old " regime has resigned . Roger Hergenrader , 51 , who has been in charge of maintenance at the agency ' s 11 rail terminals , said he will depart Friday to take a similar position , but at less pay , with Philadelphia ' s transit authority . The decision to leave his $67 , 000-a-year post came for a variety of reasons , ranging from management malaise at the CTA to the agency ' s apparent hostility to outsiders , Hergenrader said . He charged that the staff at the CTA ' s Merchandise Mart headquarters fails to give proper support to the departments that directly serve the agency ' s riders . " The CTA is not the Merchandise Mart , " he said . " The CTA is bus and rail operations . Every other part of the company ( should be ) support . That ' s the way it should be . It ' s not the way it is . " Hergenrader @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also asserted that CTA managers at every level are hampered from doing a good job because they routinely are second-guessed by their superiors . He also cited a variety of other irritants , including a refusal from headquarters to provide secretarial help , foot-dragging by the agency to make promised reimbursement for living expenses in his first months in the area and frequent failures by the CTA ' s purchasing department . Natural gas was shut off at the Rosemont shop because the authority failed to pay its bills , the 54th Street rail shop ran out of fuel oil for its boiler at least three times in the last year because of lapsed contracts and " contracts ( for parts ) run out on a routine basis , " Hergenrader said . CTA Chairman Clark Burrus acknowledged some of the problems outlined by Hergenrader , but he said that action is planned or already being taken that promises improvement . He cited as an example a new effort to allow managers to make decisions and be accountable for them . Second-guessing by superiors " is a mentality that ' s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It is clear that it existed when I got here ( last June ) , and I have been moving with all the speed I have to change it . What you are talking about is changing the culture . That is not easy , ( but ) I am dedicated to doing that . " Consultants have been hired , and conditions in the purchasing and other departments are getting better , Burrus asserted . Philosophically , Burrus said he and Hergenrader are " singing from the same hymn book . " The chairman said he agrees , for example , that administrative units at the CTA must serve the transportation and maintenance departments . Despite a stint at the CTA that spanned only 11 months , Hergenrader outlasted several other executives recruited from other cities during the tenure of Robert Paaswell , the agency ' s former executive director . The departed managers include operating chief Frank Wilson , field operations manager John Haley and Jonathan Klein , director of rail maintenance . Klein , who hired Hergenrader , quit in disgust last August after only three months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his experience at the CTA , but he is not bitter . " He should have talked to me before he quit , " Burrus said . The CTA chairman denied an " anti-outsider " posture and said executives from outside the agency will continue to be considered for top jobs along with CTA veterans .
