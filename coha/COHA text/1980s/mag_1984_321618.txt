When Ronald Reagan 's 73rd birthday hubbub subsided last week in Dixon , Ill. , the old neighborhood at the top of the hill on Hennepin Avenue tidied up to welcome the rest of the world . People will come from across oceans and states , in campers and Cadillacs , peering in the dark corners of Reagan 's restored boyhood home for insight into what makes a President . <P> Even before the peaked and porched Queen Anne-style house was refurbished , 18,000 tourists visited the new mecca . It is one of 13 such presidential boyhood homes open to the public . Nearly 200,000 people visit Dwight Eisenhower 's home each year in Abilene , Kans. , and some 30,000 find Theodore Roosevelt 's house on New York City 's East 20th Street . <P> Presidents sometimes seem to resemble their houses . The great head and strong jaw of Franklin Roosevelt fitted in with his stately Hudson River mansion at Hyde Park . Lyndon Johnson , weathered and slit-eyed , sometimes looked as if he came with the clapboards of his boyhood home in Johnson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open like the man . <P> Presidential homes are quiet stops , far away from the clang of power . They speak volumes with their family artifacts and life patterns etched in furniture , stairways and backyards . New paint sometimes glamorizes the houses too much . The home had not been " quite so shiny " when he lived in it , Reagan confessed . In the end , the memories , evoked by a fragment of wallpaper or a warm corner in the kitchen , are the stuff of such museums . <P> " It looks so much smaller , " Reagan said as he wandered through the rooms . When he studied the side yard where he , his brother Neil , and the O'Malley boys , Edward and George , used to play , he said to Neil : " They even shrank our football field . " The President took a handful of popcorn from a bowl on the sitting-room table , just where his mother Nelle always had it popped and waiting . " No salt , " he muttered . " Good , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peered down the cramped basement stairs and remembered that his father Jack , a hefty fellow , had to back down to tend the coal furnace . What might OSHA think , the President wondered . In the bedroom with its pennants and simple oak dresser , Reagan drifted back 60 years . " I read a book about Indians and started to build a tepee in here , " he said . " Nelle vetoed that . " Reagan rubbed a hand over a huge brass ball on the bedstead in his parents ' room and recalled that he had taken one from the original bed frame , put it on a broomstick and used the contraption as a baton to lead the Y.M.C.A. band . <P> The three Reagans lunched in the dining room , the prairie sun making bright squares on the floor through the white scrim curtains , memories tumbling forth about raising rabbits , collecting birds ' eggs and filling the icebox and the wood stove . <P> Then the noisy presidential caravan swept on to Dixon High School for a birthday party and flew off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Hennepin Avenue quieted and for the moment appeared to be the same tranquil corner of the Middle West it had been for more than a century . But that was deceptive . The avenue now is in the history books .
