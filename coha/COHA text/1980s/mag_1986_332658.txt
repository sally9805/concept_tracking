When a U.S. Air Force C-5A transport plane landed in the Bolivian city of Santa Cruz to launch the latest battle in America 's war on drugs , the far-off town of Trinidad , 250 miles to the northwest , paid little heed . But the next day Trinidad Mayor Pedro Alvarez was summoned to the local Bolivian air force base for some unsettling news . The gringos are coming , he was informed ; the base would need another well . Since that day , the tranquil cattle-farming community of Trinidad ( pop . 40,000 ) , capital of Bolivia 's northeastern Beni region , has not been the same . " Our humble town , " complains Alvarez , " is becoming internationally known as a cocaine center . " Trinidad has , willy- nilly , become home to the U.S. 193rd Infantry Brigade . Transported from Panama two weeks ago , the G.I.s are embarked on an earnest mission : to help the Bolivian drug-enforcement unit , known as the Leopards , wipe out cocaine- processing factories . But " Operation Blast Furnace , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dozen or so agents from the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration and representatives from 53 news organizations , has proved as confused an antic as in an Evelyn Waugh novel . <P> Few Trinidad residents have actually seen the Americans , camped out at the air base in tents . Washington officials , concerned that the sight of armed soldiers might cause problems , have ordered Trinidad off limits . When the G.I.s need fresh bread , three Hispanic-American soldiers change into civvies and sneak into town in an unmarked Chevy van . " We were ordered to stay away , " says Gerald Carroll , 29 , a Blackhawk helicopter pilot from Beespring , Ky . " They said it was like Tombstone , Ariz. , out there  --  people running around the streets with guns . " <P> Trinidad is , in fact , a dirt-and-brickpaved town where the gravest safety threat is the street life , with its unnerving mix of horses , chickens and pickup trucks . Though dozens of drug-processing labs are scattered throughout the region 's 77,220 sq . mi. of swamp and jungle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are bitter that more modern cities farther south are siphoning off the side benefits of the cocaine trade . " Five years ago half the hotels and restaurants were filled year round with narco traffickers , " sighs Jorge Lorgio Zambrana , 48 , a hotel owner . " Now I guess they go to fancier places . " Lorgio Zambrana is cynical about the operation . " We have a saying here : When you trim grass , it grows in more abundantly than before . " <P> Some suspicious citizens think their government has more in mind than the interdiction of drug manufacturing . " We keep hearing that there might be another coup , " Victor Casasola , 53 , whispers conspiratorially from behind the counter of his dress shop . " I think the government called in the gringo troops to protect itself from a military coup . " <P> The presence of U.S. soldiers would be awkward for any South American country . The Bolivian government , already beleaguered by political opponents , was stung by local press reports that condemned the support from Washington . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raid , the government initially resisted because it feared that TV camera crews would zoom in on American G.I.s carrying machine guns .
