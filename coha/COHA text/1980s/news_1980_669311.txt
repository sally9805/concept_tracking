It looks like most day-care centers or play schools , mothers chatting quietly or tending their young ones . But there is a distinct difference . This is a prison with guards and metal detectors , body searches and high barbed-wire fences . The women here at the Federal Correctional Institution in Pleasanton , California , have all been convicted of federal offenses. // As the number of women in prisons and jails around the country continues to increase about twice as fast as the number of men , there is growing concern about the effect on their children . There are model programs , like the Pleasanton Children ' s Center an hour east of San Francisco , and a few others . But they tend to be the exception rather than the rule. // When a mother is locked up , say prison officials and other experts , the effect on the children involved is much more devastating than when a father is sent to prison or jail. // Since women remain a relatively small percentage of the total inmate population ( about 10 percent ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They usually are sent much away from home . Most women in prison have young dependent children , an average of two per inmate mother . On the other hand , less than one quarter of the children of male prisoners retain stable relationships with their fathers . In many cases , the father no longer has custody rights and has lost touch with his children. // " Fatherhood doesn ' t seem to transfer to prison , but motherhood always seems to come to prison with females , " says Charles Turnbo , the young and affable warden here at Pleasanton . " For some reason , when a woman comes to prison , there seems to be less family support . It goes back to the old stigma that nice women don ' t get in trouble. // The children share the stigma society  --  and often their own relatives  --  places on their mothers . Or they may be sent to foster homes where it is hard for them to communicate with or even talk about their mothers . In the case of infants , say some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between mother and child during the first few months after birth may never occur . With few exceptions , women who have babies while incarcerated are separated from their children very shortly after giving birth. // " I think it ' s extremely important to consider what ' s happening to the children , " says Phyllis Jo Baunach , who has just completed a study of mothers in prison for the National Institute of Justice , a federal research agency . " We may be affecting another generation. " // Milton Rector , president of the National Council on Crime and Delinquency ( NCCD ) , puts it more starkly : " It guarantees . . . the possibility of children following their mothers into prison. " // According to the US Bureau of Prisons , while the number of men in federal and state prisons has gone up 54 percent in the past decade , the number of women has doubled . The number of women in all US prisons and jails now is about 23 , 000 . Many institutions for women do not record whether their inmates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , say some critics ) , but estimates range from 56 to 75 percent . With the high turnover in inmate population , the NCCD figures that as many as 250 , 000 children a year may be separated from their mothers this way. // The problem grows , but so do the attempts to solve it. // On Mother ' s Day , 1978 , The Pleasanton Children ' s Center officially opened . Administered by the NCCD with grants from the US Bureau of Prisons and private foundations , it offers mothers here a variety of programs to help them develop and maintain relationships with their children. // There is the children ' s center itself , staffed by inmates , volunteers , and professional early childhood educator Louise Rosenkrantz . During a regular visiting hours ( 10 : 30 a. m. to 2 : 30 p. m . Saturdays and Sundays ) a special facility is set up for the children and their mothers in the prison ' s education building . It is a quiet , homelike place , much different from the regular visiting room which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of people , a lot of smoke , and a lot of noise , " as one mother puts it. // The program at Pleasanton also includes classes and workshops in early childhood development conducted by Yvette Lehman , professor of early childhood education at Chabot College and founder of the Children ' s center at Pleasanton . Women may earn a certificate of completion and credit towards an associate ' s degree. // Center volunteers and staff help find good foster homes near Pleasanton and arrange transportation to the prison for the children . A " Reading is Fundamental " ( RIF ) program has been started here , as well as a service that provides legal help for such things as custody disputes . Another offshoot of the children ' s center is " Shared Beginnings , " a halfway house located nearby where pregnant inmates can get pre-and post-natal counseling and spend up to four months with their babies before returning to Pleasanton. // Often , children of incarcerated mothers fall through the cracks of state and local welfare systems . It can be unclear whether they come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ community where their mother has been forced to move , and therefore easy for social services agencies to disclaim responsibility . Children ' s center staff members help iron out these problems , but center co-director Carolyn McCall says , " We ' d like to see legislation developed that would designate these children as a special problem with special needs. " // Mothers here give the program credit for helping them to stay close to their children , develop their mothering skills , and restore their self-esteem . This is important , they say , particularly since most will retain full custody of their children upon release. // " I definitely would have missed their growing up without the center , " says Vivian , Whose 12-year-odl son and 8-year-old daughter visit her most weekends . " I ' ve been a parent to those kids . . . I feel strong about that. " // " The center staff has helped me learn how to be a mother , " says Sheila , whose 19-month-old son , Terrell , was born at Shared Beginnings . Center volunteers helped find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be sent back to Washington state , where Sheila is from . " If we didn ' t have the center , " she says , " I wouldn ' t ever see him. " // Other women say they have also been personally strengthened by being able to make decisions about their children and then act on those decisions through the children ' s center facilities. // " The center has helped me gain confidence in myself , not only as a mother but in other ways as well , " said Becky , who has a four-year-old son . " I have a real positive course of direction for myself now. " // AS concern grows for the children of incarcerated women , other institutions are responding as well. // * At the Purdy Treatment Center for Women at Gig Harbor , Washington , children may visit their mothers any time during the day , and there are plans for a house trailer on the prison grounds so that children ( and other family members as well ) may spend the weekend. // Classes on child development are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women run a nursery school at the facility for children from the nearby community . Dorene Buckles , who runs the program , says there is a waiting list for the school. // " We have yet to find a woman who does not care a great deal about what happens to her children , " she adds. // * Similar training and visiting programs are in place in Belleview , Kentucky , at the Daniel Boone Career Development Center , a branch of the Kentucky Correctional Institution for Women . The facility at Belleview provides a " parent effectiveness training " program , as well as high school equivalency courses. // Women may work at a nearby group home for children and are allowed to have their own children spend one weekend a month with them. // * At the Bedford Hills Correctional Facility in New york , a maximum-security prison for women , there is a " family reunion " program that provides trailers for 36-hour visits by inmates ' family members . Beginning in April , Bedford Hills will also start a children ' s center program patterned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counselling for mothers and children after the women have been paroled. // * In San Jose , California , the Santa Clara County Sheriff ' s Department maintains a minimum-security women ' s residential center where children of pre-school age are allowed to live with their mothers , those up to age 12 may spend the weekend , and other children may visit any time. // As with all of these programs , the women in San Jose must earn these privileges by demonstrating maturity and a willlingness to improve. // " They have to want to move toward law-abiding citizenry , " says Maria Black , a registered nurse who runs the 18-unit , apartment-like facility . " They can ' t just come here and sit . They have to have a job , be participating in vocational education , or attending a university or junior college. " // Officials point out that these kinds of programs can benefit society as well as the individual mothers and children involved . " We see this as a service not only to family members who desire to remain together but also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a determining factor in parole success , " Dorene Buckles reported to the National Institute of Health last October. // There have also been legal efforts to establish a child ' s right to be with its mother , even if she is in prison or jail. // Last year , a young woman who had given birth to a daughter in the Florida Correctional Institute for Women at Lowell fought to keep her baby ( named " Precious " ) with her . Hers was the first attempt under a 1969 Florida law allowing inmate mothers to retain custody of their newborn babies for up to 18 months . She won , and was paroled after serving two years of a 7-1/2 year sentence imposed for a $5 robbery. // A woman who gave birth to a daughter seven months after being sent to the Georgia Women ' s Correctional Center at Hardwick last year recently brought suit in federal court . Her baby was taken away after four days without a hearing to establish custody rights. // " The infant ' s certainly done nothing wrong , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " There ought to at least be some sort of hearing to determine whether the state ' s right supersedes the right of the child to be with its mother . In essence , it means the child ' s been penalized for something its parent has done. " // In this case , the mother is unmarried , and the child is being cared for by its maternal grandmother . Like many of these cases , this one raises questions about whether life inside a penal institution , even though with its own mother , is indeed best for a young child. // " All these things have to be weighed very carefully by any administrator , " says Phyllis Jo Baunach of the National Institute of Justice . " How is a baby going to be affected if it lives in a prison for six months or a year ? It ' s very complex and requires much more research. " // In England , Germany , and Mexico , there are special facilities for imprisoned women to keep their children . Some argue that ( as is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be sent to prison or jail at all. // " The tragic thing is that very few women really need cages , " says NCCD president Milton Rector. // The Federal Bureau of Prisons and some state correctional departments , in any case , are expressing more interest in providing at least better visiting and support programs for inmate mothers and their children. // " They ' re really a hidden population , " says Yvette Lehman , founder of the Pleasanton Children ' s Center . " As we go on , we find more and more challenges , more and more unmet needs. " // It ' s mid-afternoon now and time for the kids to leave the children ' s center at Pleasanton . Twelve-year-old Kevin has just proudly told his mother that he got the best mark in the class on a test . And , yes , he ' ll be sure to wear a helmet when he rides his motorbike. // Vivian walks out toward the gate with her son . He runs ahead , then turns and shouts , " Goodbye , Mom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
