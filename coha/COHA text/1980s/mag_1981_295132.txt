Reagan wins his budget ; the revolution begins <P> The debate in the House of Representatives was the angriest in ages . Democratic Leader Jim Wright of Texas shook the rafters with an accusation that the Reagan Administration wanted Congress to " lie down submissively " and let it " dictate every last scintilla " of the 1982 budget . Republican Leader Robert Michel blasted back that the only amendments the majority Democrats wanted to let his party offer to the budget bill were " bastards of the worst order for which we disown any parental responsibility . " The vote , on a key procedural test , was suspensefully close : 217 to 210 , with 29 Democrats breaking party ranks to give Ronald Reagan a narrow victory. * <P> The issue was important enough to make the passion understandable . The test vote broke the last Democratic attempt to modify Reagan 's proposals for drastic cutbacks in federal spending for the poor and disadvantaged . By week 's end , both the House and Senate had passed formal budget bills giving the President just about everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out by a conference committee , but Step 1 of the Reagan revolution in Government economic and social policy was just about accomplished . <P> Equally important , in the furious view of the losing Democrats , Reagan had taken a serious stride toward that old congressional bugaboo , the " Imperial Presidency . " Reagan raised that fear by getting the House to substitute budget proposals drafted by Office of Management and Budget Director David Stockman for those worked out by its own committees . Said House Speaker Tip O'Neill after the vote : " I 've never seen anything like this . Does this mean that any time the President is interested in a piece of legislation , he merely sends it over ? " Last week at least , the answer seemed to be yes . <P> The showdown had been building for nearly two months , ever since the House and Senate passed their first budget resolutions in early May . Those measures provided for cuts in nonmilitary spending next fiscal year just as deep as Reagan wanted-$36.6 billion in the case of the House bill-but left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decide exactly which programs were to be reduced how much . In the Republican-controlled Senate , the committees went along with Reagan 's wishes from the first . <P> But House committees , under Democratic leadership , voted reductions in a range of social programs-food stamps , child nutrition , welfare , Medicare , Medicaid , aid to education-that did not go as deep as Reagan wanted . In O'Neill 's words , the Democrats " cut them off at the knee instead of cutting them off at the hip . " The Democrats substituted reductions in other programs-Export-Import Bank loans , for example . <P> When the committee proposals were combined into a single bill , it called for fiscal 1982 spending reductions of $37.8 billion , a bit more than Reagan wanted . In distributing those cuts , the measure gave the President about 85% of what he asked for . Nonetheless , Reagan and his aides decided to press for the full 100%.
