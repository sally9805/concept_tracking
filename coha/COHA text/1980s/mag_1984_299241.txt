The Presidency <P> Walter Mondale , more than any other modern presidential candidate , is a child of the political system and the Government he seeks to control . <P> Aside from a few years of practicing private " political " law back in the ' 50s , Mondale has been campaigning for , or serving in , public office his entire adult life . His view of the nation and the world has been shaped from within the Government looking out . He has seen the private sector through the prism of lobbyists and favor seekers . Though he has drawn a six-figure salary as a Chicago lawyer for the past three years , his worth was measured by proximity to Government power . For nearly 30 years Mondale has devoted his life to spending other people 's money in the belief that Government can be a force for good in their lives . <P> When all is said and done in this singular campaign , that may be the most important consideration . The final confrontation could be classic : Walter Mondale , who knows and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reagan , who has built his power by a direct dialogue with the people and given much of his long professional life to fighting Government . <P> Mondale got his law degree on the G.I. Bill , went immediately into campaigning for Minnesota politicians , was appointed the state attorney general , named U.S. Senator to fill a vacancy , was elevated to Vice President by Jimmy Carter and has been running for President since January 1981 . <P> Reagan eked out an education doing odd jobs . He made his way successfully through the desperate Depression years on his genial Irish manner , his appealing profile and his enduring head of thick hair . He invested his movie earnings in real estate and made a bundle more , then entered government in protest against its size , cost and intrusion into individual lives . His view of power politics is still that of an outsider looking in . <P> Seventeen years separate these two men , and that seems to be an eon in the affairs of this country . Reagan as a young man never indulged in self-pity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stature from the challenge . Mondale , as a Midwest preacher 's child in those years of drought and deprivation , was scarred by the suffering . Then he heard the glorious promises of Government from his mentor , Senator Hubert Humphrey , and he never looked back . <P> Mondale , sometimes more missionary than executive , overflows with compassion and concern , and for him Government is always there , comforting and handy , playing an important and worthy role as a resource against almost any adversity . Markets and profits and personal enterprise he reads about in newspapers . Mondale knows Government 's processes , understands their limits and possibilities and has a feel for how they work . He is Government 's grandest product .
