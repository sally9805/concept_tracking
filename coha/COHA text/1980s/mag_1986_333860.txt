A half-century ago , the coveted award was given in absentia to German Pacifist Carl von Ossietzky , a writer and opponent of Nazism who died shortly after being released from a concentration camp . Last week the son of a Jewish holocaust victim , himself a survivor of the death camps at Auschwitz and Buchenwald , accepted the same Nobel Prize for Peace in Oslo for his work as witness and human rights champion . Before he began his speech , Author- Philosopher Elie Wiesel recited a Jewish prayer of gratitude , but the awful echoes of the occasion all but overwhelmed him . Accompanied to the podium by his 14-year-old son Shlomo Elisha , the Nobel laureate had to pause to regain his composure before addressing the audience of dignitaries . " Do I have the right to represent the multitudes who have perished ? " asked Wiesel . " Do I have the right to accept this great honor on their behalf ? I do not . No one may speak for the dead , no one may interpret their mutilated dreams and visions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do  --  and at this moment more than ever . " Afterward , Wiesel explained why his usual eloquence had briefly failed him . " I saw my words become visible , " he said . " I had written the speech for my father ; I saw him in the hall . My words had physical shape . Is it then anything to wonder about that I had difficulties speaking ? "
