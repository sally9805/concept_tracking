As any seasoned performer will tell you , never overplay an anticlimax . Ronald Reagan knows that better than most , and his second Inaugural , a four-day wingding that begins this Friday , will be quieter , more controlled and a good deal less ostentatious than his first . The Inaugural , America 's 50th , is being carefully crafted by the soon-to-depart Michael Deaver and the Presidential Inaugural Committee to rein in spending and promote a new egalitarian image for the Administration . Its theme : " We the People . . . An American Celebration . " <P> After his record-setting $16.3 million , nouveau-riche extravaganza in 1981 , the President had raised the possibility of a simple swearing-in ceremony this time , without any of the surrounding hoopla . But Republican Party politicos convinced him otherwise . " We knew we could n't just have a swearing-in , " says Ronald Walker , chairman of the Inaugural committee and manager of the party 's clockwork Dallas convention . " There had to be an opportunity for people to come to Washington and celebrate the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of $9 million to $10 million , the committee is scheduling one-third fewer events this year . Gone are 1981 's candlelight dinners and highbrow concerts at the Kennedy Center , and satellite balls across the country . Even the parade following the public swearing-in , with its 57 floats , 43 bands , the U.S. equestrian team and a dogsled , has been cut from the normal 2 1/2 hrs. to 1 hr. 15 min . The method : faster marching . <P> The Constitution mandates that the President be sworn in on the 20th , so a private ceremony will be held on Sunday at the White House , attended only by the First Family , the Vice President and his family , the Cabinet and White House aides . A public ceremony will follow on Monday at the West Front of the Capitol before TV cameras and an anticipated crowd of 140,000 . The President will wear a business suit instead of the black club coat and striped trousers he favored in 1981 . Mrs. Reagan will be wearing an electric-blue outfit by Adolfo . <P> This Inaugural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Friday 's opening pageant and fireworks display on the Ellipse , for example , will be free . The number of reviewing boxes along the Pennsylvania Avenue parade route ( $12.50 to $100 per seat ) has been reduced to provide more standing room . <P> The committee expects that income will equal or even surpass the cost , as it did last time . The sources : ticket sales , souvenirs ranging from cuff links and tie-bar sets ( $25 ) to porcelain eagles ( $1,750 ) , and $2.2 million from advertising on the televised portion of the Inaugural gala ( ABC ) . But some cost-cutting efforts have backfired . Seeking 200 performers for public events , a committee consultant placed an ad in a trade publication for nonunion , " clean-cut , All-American types , " to work for expenses but no wages . Several unions , including the Screen Actors Guild , which Reagan headed more than three decades ago , were outraged . Walker apologized to the unions for the ad , but decided to keep the nonpaid performers in the program . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ federal agencies , and the Actors Equity Association is planning a protest in Washington on Saturday .
