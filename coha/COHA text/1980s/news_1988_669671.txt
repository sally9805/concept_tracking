With all the attention on the new federal rules to make banks clear checks faster , many people missed the fact that bank customers have some responsibility here , too : They have to sign their names properly , or at least in the proper space. // The federal law , which took effect Sept. 1 , guaranteeing customers faster access to their deposits also contains some uniform standards for endorsing checks . All endorsements must now be contained within a 1 - inch section along the edge of the back of the check so they don ' t get in the way of endorsements from the bank where the check is deposited. // As for those big rubber stamps stores use to make lines for a clerk to write in your driver ' s license number , telephone number , credit card number , and any other number they can think of , those stamps are going to have to be more compact , too . The new stamps also have to be confined to the new endorsement area. // // The Federal Reserve System says these rules @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ require checks drawn on local banks to be cleared in three days , out-of-state checks within seven days , and government checks within one day. // Be careful when you redeem EE bonds // Buying United States savings bonds on a regular basis and holding them until maturity is a sound and easy way to save for the future , but it ' s also important to pay attention to when they are cashed in. // Until they are 1 years old , the interest on EE savings bonds is credited on the first of every month for the previous month . So if you cash in a bond on Sept. 30 , you ' ll lose out on all of September ' s interest . Do it the next day , Oct. 1 , and you get the extra month ' s interest. // After the first 18 months , the interest on EE bonds is calculated every six months . The same strategy applies here , as well . If the bond was bought in February , the interest will be added up on Aug. 1 . But if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ' ll lose the whole six month ' s interest. // Also , if you buy the bond on the last day of the month , the interest will be credited as if you had bought it at the beginning of that period. // Sizing up mutual funds on a PC // People who have personal computers and read Forbes magazine for its annual survey of mutual funds can now combine them . The magazine has a ' ' Mutual Fund Evaluator , ' ' a computer program that screens and generates reports on the performance of more than 800 equity funds. // The evaluator is a floppy diskette designed to run on the IBM PC and compatibles and lets an investor look for funds that meet any of 35 investment criteria. // People can find funds that had the best performance over various time periods , ranging from three months to 10 years , as well as those that meet the investor ' s standards for risk , yields , assets , net asset value , loads , and volatility . It will also assign the magazine ' s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ranging from A to F. // Information on how to get the program is contained in the magazine ' s Sept. 12 issue. // Sorry to rush the // season , but . . . // Mid-September may seem a bit early to start thinking about Christmas shopping , but some people like to get an early start . They avoid the rush and find more things to choose from. // Although the idea of shopping early isn ' t new , more people are making lists well ahead of time , thinking carefully about several options that Aunt Tillie might like , how much they want to spend on everyone , and keeping the list handy when they go shopping . Gifts can turn up in unexpected places . Having the list close at hand also cuts down on impulse buying and overspending , and helps you come up with more satisfying gifts than those bought in the last hours. // An early and well-planned start will also help keep spending - especially credit card spending - manageable and help you pay off total balances each month and avoid finance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ banks and as high as 22 percent at some. // Title insurance offers more shelter // For many first-time home buyers , the first time they are told about title insurance , they may think it ' s just one more expense . But title insurance can be valuable. // For a few hundred dollars paid at the time of sale , the title-insurance company does a complete investigation of the title to the property , to make sure the people who are selling the house have clear title to it , and that the people they bought the house from also had clear title. // By looking through public records , private files , and documents of previous transactions , title search companies can make sure there are no claims , liens , rights , or encumbrances are attached to the property that could void the sale or that the new owner // would have to pay for. // Once a title-insurance policy is issued , the homeowner ' s rights are protected against any previously-unknown claims that may come up . If a claim is made against a standing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claims which the homeowner must pay to defend his rights . Also , most title-insurance companies will pay any covered loss which comes out of a valid claim . This protection covers the property as long as the purchaser or the heirs own the home. // A mutual fund of bank loans - really // Banks haven ' t had it very good this year . Both federal agencies that supervise banks and savings-and-loans , the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation , have been busy arranging multi-billion-dollar sales , transfers , and other bailouts of banks and thrifts around the country in 1988. // So a mutual fund that is made up of a portfolio of commercial bank loans may not seem to be an example of the best timing . But the Pilgrim Prime Rate Trust could prove to be a useful investment for consumers , pension funds , and partnerships that want stability of principal and higher yields than are available on certificates of deposit. // The fund will buy collateralized commercial loans from domestic corporations that are written by money-center and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pilgrim Group Inc. of Los Angeles since May 11 , also gives bankers a chance to see if a mutual fund is a good way to sell packages of commercial loans to the public . At present , these loan packages are generally sold in multi-million-dollar units to institutional investors. // The minimum investment is somewhat higher than the average consumer-oriented fund : $5 , 000 in most cases , but $2 , 000 for individual retirement accounts. // The fund is closed-end , which means it will have a fixed number of shares that are traded on securities markets. // //
