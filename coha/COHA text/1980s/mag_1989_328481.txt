To several hard-pressed Indian tribes , the millions of gallons of oil and gas flowing from reservation wells have meant the difference between crushing poverty and financial stability . Now the Senate Special Committee on Investigations reports that one oil company may have stolen as much as 1.9 million bbl. , worth $31 million , from the tribes since 1986 . In hearings before the committee last week , investigators told of concealing themselves near remote oil-storage depots in Oklahoma earlier this spring to watch employees of Wichita-based Koch Industries transferring oil from Osage tribal storage tanks to trucks . According to witnesses , Koch employees typically reported removing only 100 bbl. of oil for every 101 bbl. actually taken . Arizona 's Democratic Senator Dennis DeConcini , chairman of the committee , said he would refer the matter to the Justice Department for possible prosecution .
