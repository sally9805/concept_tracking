Like many other rural congregations , the Kinmundy United Methodist Church ( congregation : 170 ) in southern Illinois has long relied on the collection plate for its modest income . But all that changed this year when a tract of farm land , which had been willed to the church nearly 30 years ago , began spewing oil at the rate of 165 bbl. a day and producing $10,000 royalty checks for the church every month . Since then the membership has been arguing over God 's intentions for the money . <P> Some say it should be plowed into good works , including a few improvements at the 80-year-old red brick church . Thriftier souls say the money should be placed in a trust . A flood of more than 500 supplicants , seeking everything from rent money to a new roof , has compounded the problem . Nor is the situation improving . A second well , adjacent to the first , started spouting oil , doubling the church 's monthly income . So far , more than $100,000 has been banked locally , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next 20 to 30 years . " We 're just trying to do the right thing for God , " says Kinmundy 's pastor , the Rev. John Hartleroad . " But it 's really not been any fun . "
