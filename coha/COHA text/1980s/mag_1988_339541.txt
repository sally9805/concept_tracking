This is not , Marcel Ophuls insists , a biography of the notorious " Butcher of Lyons , " convicted by a French court in 1987 of crimes against humanity as chief of the Gestapo unit stationed in that city during World War II . The film is , Ophuls says , a study of people 's responses  --  the complicity , the indifference , the willed ignorance  --  to the face of evil presented to them by Klaus Barbie . <P> His strategy is sound . For Barbie is that familiar archetype , the sadist whose dark impulses might have remained impotent had they not been licensed by a police bureaucracy demanding results , and no questions asked . This pathology is beyond comprehension by conventional reportage , beyond control by conventional moral opprobrium . Confronting him , the decent individual can only defend his own integrity . The painful cost of that integrity is shown by the survivors of Barbie 's interrogations , the witnesses to his depredations , in the interviews that form the film 's redemptive center . <P> These gallant few provide the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their collaborators and , most important to Ophuls , the people who sheltered Barbie for almost 40 years . These include American counterintelligence officers who used him as an anti-Communist agent , Vatican contacts who spirited him to South America and the corrupt establishments of Bolivia and Peru that helped him earn an enviable livelihood . <P> When a film aims to awaken moral awareness , it may seem ungrateful to inquire how it discharges its obligations to art . But there are long passages in Hotel Terminus ( the title refers to the hostelry where Barbie had his headquarters ) in which the picture 's failure to select and shape its materials seriously vitiates its power to grip and instruct our consciences . Worse , there are deeply disquieting moments when Ophuls abandons the documentarian 's traditionally modest on-screen role as a reporter in search of a story and presents himself instead as an egotist in search of a platform . <P> These flaws were present in his earlier four-hour-plus documentaries on the Nazis , The Sorrow and the Pity ( 1971 ) and The Memory of Justice ( 1976 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a great realistic novel , dependent for its force on the patient , even repetitive , accretion of detail . By now , length and weight have become an end in itself for Ophuls , a way of enforcing the audience 's commitment to his work . Anything that demands this much of us can not be casually dismissed . Too much , though , is streaked with irrelevancies : digressions and dubious stock footage ; interviews with people who have no significant knowledge of Barbie 's activities or are full of mind- numbing details about them ; pointless sequences of Ophuls braving the anger of reluctant subjects or horseplaying with his crew . <P> These are indulgences and impositions . And they subtly debase the courage in truly dire circumstances of the men and women at the film 's moral core . They also divert us from Ophuls ' central frustration . He clearly wanted to show that Barbie was protected by Americans and other friends in high places , but he can not prove it . Barbie owed his long freedom to his own international underclass of thugs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that group 's influence  --  and not as an inflated moral statement  --  that Hotel Terminus has its considerable , unintended value .
