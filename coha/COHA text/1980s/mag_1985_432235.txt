 | Until eight years ago , Ron House , a 39-year-old financial consultant from Richmond , Ky. , was often so manic he had to check into a hospital for two or three weeks a year to recover from exhaustion . Neither tranquilizing drugs nor his psychia- trist 's advice that he stop demanding so much of himself solved his problem . What finally did was a programmed 20-day stay at a hospital in which he first fasted for five days , then resumed eating specific foods , one at a time . Doctors were thus able to pinpoint three specific foods ? beets , corn and peanut butter ? as the culprits that seemed to bring on the enervating highs . Since then , although doctors told House he could gradually reintroduce those foods provided he stuck to a " rotation " diet ? meaning he could eat any particular food only every four days ? he has not touched them . He observes the diet strictly , a small price to pay , he says , for having his life under control again . House sleeps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ markedly reduced his triglyceride levels , though he still eats high-cholesterol foods . " It 's the greatest blessing I 've ever had , " he says . By strict scientific standards , the proposition that you are what you eat remains scarcely more than a hypothesis . Yet some doctors are now citing experiences like House 's to back their belief that food does affect the way people feel and the way they function in significant ways . A self-styled " specialty " of clinical ecology ( a.k.a. " environmental medicine " ) has grown up around the controversial theory that certain foods or chemicals may be linked to an array of symptoms , including behavior disorders , depression , chronic fatigue and hypertension . Public fancy , meanwhile , has seized on the reverse side of the theory . The conviction that the right batch of daily nutrients can put more topspin on your life has helped sustain the multibillion-dollar health-food industry , as well as an insatiable appetite for diet and nutrition books . Criminal Behavior : The popularization of the subject , moreover , has brought an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Such substances as food additives and sugar , for instance , have been freely implicated in everything from hyperactivity in children to criminal behavior in adults . But the food connection is getting increased attention even from traditional medicine . The rock-ribbed American Medical Association itself cosponsored a symposium on the topic last year , and the National Institute of Mental Health is funding studies in the field . Says Dr. Wayne Callaway , endocrinologist and nutritionist at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester , Minn. : " There is no argument that diet affects mood . The big argument is how does it do it . " The main difficulty with the foodmood premise is that most of the evidence so far has tended to be anecdotal . The accounts of dramatic diagnoses and cures have shed little light on the differences between allergies and food aversions . In what are called " true allergies , " the body 's immune system triggers a defensive reaction , producing dramatic effects like wheezing or hives . There are some people whose throats swell when they eat peanuts or mushrooms . A psychological @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result of unpleasant memories or associations about particular foods . In any case , much more needs to be known about the biological mechanisms by which such mood problems as depression can be touched off . Clinical ecologists claim that well over half of the population is sensitive to certain chemicals or foods that make @# @# them subject to a malfunction of the immune system called " immune dysregulation . " To diagnose the condition they use an assortment of methods ? that more traditional researchers dismiss as useless or even harmful ? ranging from the injection of progressively stronger allergen solutions to various " elimination " diets , in which foods are removed and then reintroduced one by one . Cathie-Ann Lippman , a Beverly Hills psychiatrist , reports that she diagnosed one woman patient who suffered from severe depression and mood swings by injecting her with a dilution of corn extract . The woman reacted severely ; she could barely move or open her eyes until Lippman gave her a " neutralizing dose " ? a weak dilution of the same allergen . As part of her treatment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hidden ingredient in many foods such as iodized salt and even Vitamin C. She also put her on a rotation diet . As a result , Lippman says , " there 's been a tremendous change in her . She 's far more productive at work . She 's sustained a relationship for two years now . Her life is so much happier and I have no doubt it 's because of discovering those things she was sensitive to . " Most classically trained allergists scoff at such claims . One soon-to-be-published report by the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America terms the diagnostic methods " experimental " and " unproven , " and finds no evidence to support the existence of immune-system dysregulation . Other authori-@#  | ties simply contend vigorously that the whole of clinical ecology is " quackery . " That sort of criticism infuriates the convinced . " Consider that these guys have gone to medical school and they 're taught a system of allergy diagnosis that basically has not changed since the 1800s , " observes Los Angeles biological chemist Lewis Mayron , who has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simply do n't want to learn anything new . " Psychiatrist Lippman agrees : " It 's amazing to me . I will say to my colleagues , Do you believe strawberries cause a rash ? ' and they 'll say , Sure . ' Then I 'll say , Do you think strawberries can cause a headache ? ' and they 'll say , No . ' And I 'll say , Why not ? ' If it can cause a problem in one organ , why not another organ ? My wish would be for all doctors to have a more open mind . " Milk Capsules : Research on the food-mood connection has focused heavily on the effects of milk , wheat and other carbohydrates that are suspected by some investigators of causing impaired brain functioning . One such study was conducted by Dr. John Crayton , an associate professor of psychiatry at the University of Chicago Medical Center , because patients had been reporting that their mood changed markedly after eating some foods . Using 65 subjects ( including 20 nonpatients who said they had no food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between the ingestion of wheat and milk capsules and mood and behavior changes that included fatigue , depression , irritability and difficulty in thinking clearly . To ensure the " double blind " nature of the study ? a point on which many existing studies are faulted ? neither the test administrators nor the patients were allowed to know what was in the food capsules . Crayton took measures against another frequent criticism of the tests , that they rely too much on subjective reports from patients , by having an observer as well as the subject note the mood changes . Says Crayton : " They correlated very well . " In addition , each subject had blood samples taken twice a day for the eight days they were studied . The samples showed immune-system changes , suggesting the foodmood link is not a traditional allergy , but another sort of immune reaction in which " the body is trying to neutralize the food . It 's trying to create an antibody to it . " Though Crayton does not know precisely how that translates into mood changes , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brain . Given that the effects of food on some bodily functions are well documented , it seems logical to him that food could affect the brain as well . Cray- ton 's study has not been published yet , and he can not be sure whether the scientific community will endorse the results . He cautions , in any case , that it is only a beginning . In the meantime , he notes , some of his patients are responding to dietary treatment . The anecdotes still tend to outweigh the clinical research . But other studies are beginning to expand the body of data . David S. King , a psychologist at the University of California 's Langley Porter Psychiatric Institute , found that small doses of selected foods produced a wide range of symptoms in his subjects , including feeling " merry , " " out of it , " angry or depressed . King has received NIMH funding to do further studies . " What if ? that 's why we 're doing this , " he says . " What if foods do play a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the black-box stage , because the field is extremely wide open . There is data on both sides . " At Texas Tech University in Lubbock , Dr. Bonnie Spring and a coinvestigator conducted three separate studies in which they found a link between high carbohydrate/low protein diets and drowsiness that in turn causes impaired performance . Other investigators see a comforting message in this : eat protein if you want to remain alert and attentive , but for sleep , eat carbohydrates . The reason , explains MIT psychologist Harris Lieberman , is that carbohydrates eaten alone increase the brain 's uptake of the amino acid tryptophan . In turn , the tryptophan stimulates production of serotonin , a neurotransmitter that has a hypnotic effect . As a result of that process , notes another MIT researcher , Dr. Richard Wurtman , although many people have suspected sugar ( a carbohydrate ) as the cause of hyperactivity in children , there was " reason to believe it had the opposite effect ? and that turns out to be true . " One investigator , in fact , may have reversed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may affect what foods we choose . In five-year tests at Simon Fraser University in British Columbia , psychologist Bernard Lyman says he found that people experiencing different emotional states preferred different kinds of food . In general , they preferred hearty , full-course meals when they were feeling happy and self-confident , junk foods when they were depressed . Wurtman and his wife , Judith , a carbohydrate expert , partly confirm that observation . They note that obese people , for instance , often crave carbohydrates because they make them feel less anxious and depressed ? another indication , perhaps , of the tryptophan-serotonin effect . The NIMH 's Dr. Norman Rosenthal , who popularized the concept of seasonal affective disorders ( like the " winter blues " ) , also found that some of his winter-depressed people craved carbohydrates . " It would be surprising to me , " he says , " if we did not find some link between food and mood . some type of regulatory connection to our reward centers . Foods are chemicals , and some people may be medicating themselves with food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Most such conclusions are admittedly conjectural . The hard , clinching evidence is simply not there , mainly because the effects of the food-mood relationship are subtle and difficult to demonstrate . But researchers complain that the medical establishment is bent on debunking the claims instead of devising new ways to test them . " This is a major problem that the establishment has ignored , " acknowledges Dr. Dean Metcalfe , the food-allergy expert of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases . Admittedly , also , there is a lot of heat surrounding the issue , and it has succeeded in polarizing most discussions of it . " People are passionate about the subject , " says biochemist Bambi Young , of the Center for Science in the Public Interest in Washington , who explored the subject in depth for a not-yet-published book . " They like the idea of foods causing the problem . It is something they can control . " Like many investigators , Young concludes , " I really think there is something there .
