A pile of bones , six teeth , some clumps of hair and a pair of rotting trousers . Such are the meager contents of the grave at Embu . Somewhere in this grisly heap , forensic scientists last week sought to find a series of identifying fragments of the Nazi doctor Josef Mengele . The task , experts say , is a tough one , even with some of the best forensic minds in the world applying their talents . There is no doubt that certain facts about the skeleton will be established . The question is , will a complete identity emerge ? Even in the most difficult cases , says Clyde Snow , an American consultant on the Mengele case , " it 's amazing what a little piece of bone can do . " <P> Though forensic medicine has become highly refined in recent years , the trained eye is still among the most reliable tools . Sex , for instance , can be identified by the shape of the intact pelvis : generally , a woman 's has a wider opening to permit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or two , from the lengths of the major arm or leg bones . Race can be indicated by the texture of the hair or from certain features of the skull , among them the shape of the eye sockets and the spacing of the nasal apertures . <P> The Brazilian team has already concluded that the remains are those of a Caucasian male . Their estimate of his stature conforms with Mengele 's recorded height of 5 ft. 8 1/2 in . <P> Age is a more difficult problem . Because bone growth in humans occurs according to a more or less predictable timetable , forensic experts can usually tell the age of a skeleton of a child or young adult . But most of the skeletal changes are complete by about age 45 , when the flat bones of the skull have fused . <P> Thus clues as to whether the skeleton from Embu belonged to Mengele , who would have been 67 when the body was buried , or to a man ten or even 15 years younger , must be gleaned from studying subtle degenerative changes in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Teeth provide important clues . Their alignment , the shapes of the roots , the patterns of wear and dental work are different in each individual . " It may be one tooth that puts the whole story together , " says Snow , a forensic anthropologist from Norman , Okla . The rest of the skeleton can also yield information . Gunshot wounds , fractures and other major injuries often leave lifelong traces . So can diseases such as syphilis and tuberculosis and bone disorders like osteomyelitis , an infection from which Mengele is said to have suffered . <P> In addition , " bone responds to what we do , " says Anthropologist Stephanie Damadio of the Smithsonian Institution . A clarinetist 's jaw will sometimes suggest his profession or a waitress 's developed arm strength may be evident in the bone . <P> The skull holds clues . Photosuperimposition , in which video cameras are used to merge an image of the skull with a photograph of the suspected dead person 's face , can often reveal a matching structure . The face can be reconstructed on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clay .
