When the Phelps Dodge Corporation , the nation 's largest independent copper producer , temporarily shut down its huge mine , mill and smelter in Morenci , Arizona , in AiSlil - 14 , 1982 , Greenlee County 's unemployment rate soared ' above 65 percent , the highest in the country . By ithen , ' : GeoAe Mungia , an electrician at the second largest copper mine in the United States , had been laid off ' for more than six months : Although the facility reopened in October 1982 , it was not until early July that Phelps Dodge offered him his job back , with all the overtime he could handle . Mungia was invited back to help break the strike of more than 2,200 workers at P.D . facilities in Arizona , nearly 1,500 of whom are at Morenci . Mungia has become a scab . His brother-in-law , a strong union man , walks the picket line that Mungia crosses daily . His father , who was two months shy of retirement when the strike began on July 1 , was initially torn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out so as not to scab on the union that won , that benefit for him . He too now crosses the line . Mungia 's sister is dating a local cop , who is helping other police officers from throughout the state protect workers like Mungia and his father from angry strikers . Whatever its outcome , nothing like this strike has bffn seen here since the great labor struggles of the 1930s , and it will leave a legacy of hatred that will last for years to come , not only in Morenci but in the Arizona towns of Ajo , Douglas , Bisbee and Safford , where Phelps Dodge also has facilities . Strikes are common in the copper industry . Since 1959 Phelps Dodge workers have gone on strike every three years after contract negotiations have broken off . The strikes , especially those over working conditions , have been bitter and hard fought , but they have always been followed by a period of labor peace . In the past , P.D . refrained from producing copper when workers were on strike . It made ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the curtailed production would push up the market price . Occasional respites from the hard labor of copper mining and processing were accepted , if not welcomed , by union members . Their " continuing agreement " with P.D . E ; aranteed that their jobs would be waiting for them when a pute was settled . But 1983 has been different . The deep recession , not only in the copper industry but in the economy as a whole , coupled with an antilabor Administration in the White House , has weakened the workers ' bargaining position . Negotiations in April between most copper companies , led by Kennecott ; the nation 's leading producer , and thirteen unions representing copper workers , led by the United Steel Workers of America ( U.S.W.A. ) , resulted in a three-year contract which froze wages but retained cost of living allowances and other benefits . Of the large producers , only Phelps Dodge refused to go along with the settlement . Analysts disagree on why P.D . broke with the rest of the industry and chose to confront the unions . By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ copper and foreign competition , and says it i , must slash labor costs to remain competitive . Last year P.D . , lost more than $74 million as copper prices plunged to 166 cents a pound from an average of $1 a pound . The company claims the wage and benefit plan it offered its workers will save-$51 million over the next three years . Despite the heavy losses it suffered last year , P.D . has earned more than $550 million over the past decade and is responsible for at least some of that " foreign " competition by virtue of its mining interests in Peru , Australia and South Africa . Moreover , P.D . spends less to produce its copper than any other domestic producer , and according to its 1982 annual report it is " in the lower half of the free world cost spectrum . " The company 's continuing competitiveness , even in a depressed market , is shown by the profits it earned during the first six months of this year : $13.5 million in primary metals ( mostly copper ) and $7.3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ P.D . ' s real problem is its failure to diversify , which led to losses of more than $23 million over the same six-month period . The company lumps - those losses together in a category headed " corporate and other : " Some were undoubtedly a result of the high ' interest rates-P.D. is paying on its debts and its bloated payroll for administrative and sales personnel . Other substantial P.D . losses stem from the problems of its wholly owned subsidiary Western . Nuclear . In 1981 its largest , customer , the Washington Public Power Supply System , filed a civil suit- against both P.D . and Western Nuclear , charging them with conspiring to fix uranium prices since 1972 . Shortly after filing the suit , Washington Public Power canceled its uranium contracts with Western Nuclear , causing losses of more than $13.5 million over the last eighteen- months , - - Whatever the underlying causes of P , D. 's financial difficulties , the strikers and their unions have a simple explanation for the company 's behavior , They charge that RD. is trying to break @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slash benefits , eliminate job security and seniority rights and rewrite production and safety rules . To back up that charge , they point out that on June 30 the company terminated the " continuing agreement " that has served as the basis of labor-management relations for more , than four decades . P.D . workers regard- that eighty-seven-page contract as , the culmination.of , struggles , strikes and collective bargaining by , grandfathers , fathers and older brothers who were members of the militant Mine , Mill and Smelter Workers finion ; which until Red-baiting and raiding by other unions forced it to merge with the U.S.W.A. in 1967 , represented the majority of copper workers in the West . The termination of the contract , combined with P.D . ' s insistence on maintaining production during the strike , made a confrontation inevitable . - - On July 1 , P.D . unilaterally imposed new working conditions and lower wage andbenefit schedules . All employees hired after that date are paid $9 an hour , $2 less than the average union wage . The wages of workers already on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been eliminated . Medical coverage has been reduced from 100 percent to less than 80 percent , and a $100 deductible provision has been attached . Holidays , vacations and pension benefits have been slashed . Perhaps most damaging to the workers are the changes in grievance procedures and the elimination of many work and safety rules . All thirteen unions , which sixteen years ago formed- a Unity Council , struck immediately . P.D . countered by shifts ing most of its salaried and management personnel from clerical and administrative tasks to production jobs . The workday was extended to twelve hours ; the work " week " to twelve days on two days off . P.D . warned the strikers that it planned to hire permanent replacements-if they did not return to their jobs . Assuming that few strikers would return immediately , and in need of skilled workers , Phelps Dodge offered jobs to more than 650 employees who had been laid off for more than a year and to people who had recently retired from the company . Morenci is a company town . When someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expectation that it is for life . Job , home ? and community are tightly integrated . Many families have lived in the town for generations , and community ties run deep . It would have been impossible for Phelps Dodge to bring in outside strikebreakers if local people weren:t. already crossing the picket lines and dividing the community . The offer of jobs to laid-off workers like George Mungia was intended to have exactly that effect ? P.D . hoped that once the community 's pro-union solidarity was breached , the strike would collapse . Most workers had , suffered through a six-month layoff last year , and the company thought that financial difficulties might force them to return to work . Mungia expressed the company 's view when he said , " There are only scabs and those soon to become scabs . " But the core of strikers remained solid . As the conflict entered its sixth week , the key facility in Morenci , where 1,480 ? union workers Shad been employed before the strike , was being manned by slightly more than 400 strikebreakers and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the strike could not be broken locallY . At this point P.D . decided to bring in outside strikebreakers . The decision was made at the highest corporate G level . Board chairman George Munroe and P.D . president Richald Moolich flew from New York to Phoenix , where they gave final approval to a plan drawn up by their Western Management Group , headed by senior vice president Arthur- Kinneberg. - It was common knowledge in Arizona , where one out of every eight jobs is dependent on the copper industry , that this move would lead to violence . The only surprise was how fast it came . P.D . announced its plan on Friday , August 5 . The rank-and-file strikers in Morenci immediately recognized that it threatened the survival of their unions . On Monday , August 8 , hundreds of striking workers armed with ax handles , chains and baseball bats , and supported by a crowd estimated by police at 2,000 , disrupted the afternoon shift- change . Many nonstrikers on their way to work were harassed and chased away ; many whose shifts were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spenta nervous night hiding in the open pit . He was able to sneak out the next morning , after a temporary truce had been declared . . Democratic Governor Bruce Babbitt flew to Morenci Monday night , and the next day he persu , aded P.D . officials 4 to call a ten-day production moratorium . The compan went along with the Governor because it seemed likely th ' the police forces in the town would not be able to prevent strikers from crossing police barricades , entering the mine and removing the scabs by force , as they had threatened to do . Instead of allowing the strikers to impose a shutdown , the Governor urged P.D . to close the works . On the surface , the strikers ' militant defense of their jobs appeared to be , a great victory . The key to this strike has always been whether or not P.D . can sustain production at something approaching a normal level . Ironically , P.D . ' s decision to halt production temporarily marked the beginning of a shift in the balance of power in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Governor Babbitt , whom strikers quickly dubbed " Scabbitt , " turned Morenci into an armed camp by ordering the largest mobilization of state police officers and National Guardsmen in the history of Arizona . More than 400 highway patrol officers and 3g0 guardsmen , - supported by armored personnel carriers and helicopters , were dispatched to Morenci so that P.D4quid reopen its mine , mill and smelter without interference . jt At dawn on Saturday , August 20 , more than 280 heavily armed state police officers lined up on both-sides of P.D . ' s gates . Soon a mile-long convoy of strikebreakers and salaried personnel rolled past five pickets at the main entrance . Not only was production resumed that day , but about sixty new employees , hired as permanent replacements for strikers , reported for work . Jim Krass , chief picket captain for Local 616 of the U.S.W.A. , who was on the line that morning , remarked , " This town will never be the same . On this day Phelps Dodge has ripped the knife right down to_the the bone . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picket lines , along with about sixteen others . Figures released by P.D . show how badly the strikers were hurt by the state 's intervention . On August 5 , when the company announced its decision to hire outside workers , only about 700 people returned to work throughout the state . One week after the reopening of the Morenci facility , 1,363 strikebreakers w w on the job statewide and only 812 positions remained to RE , filled . From the outset of the strike , P.D . has taken the initiative . The company was better prepared than the regional and national officers of the major unions involved , , who at first failed to grasp the magnitude of the attack being mounted against the workers . Only the rank and file and a few local union leaders showed any enterprise . As P.D . ' s strategy became clear and its position grew stronger , national union leaders desperately sought to come up with an offer that would meet the company 's financial demands and get the union contract reinstated : At the end of August they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as much money as P.D . ' s own plan , without sacrificing cost of living allowances . In other words , the union leadership proposed ways of reducing benefits that even the company had not suggested . P.D . turned down the offer , saying the union 's ideas were " helpful " but that cost of living- allowances had to go . Cass Alvin , a spokesman for the steelworkers , admitted the " union is painted into a corner . " He said that when The unions settled with the other copper companies in April , they promised not to negotiate a lower settlement with any of their competitors . But he hinted that the unions in the Unity Council would make further concessions if they were " imposed " by an outside arbiter . The strike seems to have become a war of attrition , and the unions have mounted a legal offensive . They have filed unfair labor practice charges with- the National Labor Relations Board and have challenged in court , with some success , both the threatened eviction of fired workers from company , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minor picket-line infractions . The unions have also demanded a Congressional investigation of the strike . More immediate relief has come as a result of the National Nonferrous Industry Conference convened by the unions at the end of August . Delegates pledged to collect a ' day 's wages each month from all 100,000 workers in the industry to aid the P.D . strikers . ( Copper workers in the dlObe/Miami region , near Morenci , have been contributing to the Strikers for some time . ) Over the Labor Day weekend dernonstrations and solidarity marches were held in mining towns throughout Arizona . , - As the strike entered its eleventh wee , k , , John Bolles , manager at the Morenci facility , claimed he was achieving " 100 percent production " with a work force of 1,244 . Two hundred thirty-six are long-term laid-off workers , like George Mungia . Four hundred thirty-six are men like Mungia 's father , ? who were working when , the strike began and either never honored the picket lines or subsequently returned to work . Finally , there are about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Bolles says- he is still hiring , but only " highly skilled people " in " selected areas . " And he , says - that " we have , plenty of applications , " which , is hardly surprising given that 50 percent of Arizona copper workers are unemployed . Forgotten by the company are - the more than 1,500 strikers , some of whom worked for P.D . for forty years . ghost of them expected to do so until they retired or died . helps Dodge considers these people part of its past . P.D . ' s vice president for personnel , John Coulter , insists that all people currently working for the company are permanent employees . The company will save more than $2.25 million a year on wages alone for the 600 new workers . The unions claim they have forced the company to resume negotiations . but according to Coulter - the talks center on " housekeeping items , " and he says they are " not making progress . " On September 9 , after talks were recessed for the weekend , Coulter said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is over . " But the strike is not over , and as it moves toward the end of its third month , two questions remain : Can the rank - and - file strikers and their local union leaders in Morenci , Ajo , Douglass , Bisbee and Safford , who are fighting notonly for their jobs but for their homes as well , influence the outcome of the struggle ? Will Phelps Dodge bother to negotiate with the unions if strikebreakers continue to cross the picket lines and produce the copper ?
