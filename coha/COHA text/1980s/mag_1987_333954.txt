In just a few hours , New Year 's Eve festivities were to begin at the Dupont Plaza in San Juan . The hotel 's 423 rooms were filled , and every table in the penthouse restaurant had been reserved . It would be , predicted Howard Puig , assistant manager of the hotel 's disco , " the night of the year . " On the mezzanine , gamblers were already crowding into the posh casino . Through the large picture windows they could see the pounding surf and a clear blue afternoon sky that seemed to bode well . As bettors hunched forward for yet another round of blackjack and croupiers gave the roulette wheels an added spin , there came a whisper : " Smoke . " Nobody paid any attention . <P> Then , out of nowhere , thick black clouds and the crack of two or three explosions . " A ball of fire came through , " said Croupier Susano Gonzalez Perez . " It blew open the door . People were trampled . " Some raced toward the picture windows , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then jumped 30 ft. to the ground . Bathers near the pool where other survivors landed fled from the spray of shards . Many huddling near the casino 's closed door , apparently unable to pry it open , died of smoke inhalation . Others farther inside perished immediately ; rescue workers found their charred corpses sitting upright in chairs around the blackjack tables . The terror did not end on the mezzanine . Smoke poured out of the lower floors and wrapped the 22-story building in a dense cloak . On the twelfth floor , Nancy Brensson , 12 , of Cresskill , N.J. , was watching a rerun of The Carol Burnett Show while her mother was taking a shower . " Suddenly the room went dark , " she said . " I looked out and saw this cloud . My father said that it was probably rain . But he opened the balcony door , and smoke rushed in . " <P> The Brenssons ran for the stairwell , only to be met by other panicky guests and a thick wall of smoke . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ climbed onto the 20th-floor balcony that encircles the hotel . There three men helped lift them and others onto the top of the building . Throughout the late afternoon , six helicopters hovered in the air , plucking survivors from the roof . <P> By week 's end the death toll had reached 95 , and at least 106 people were injured . That made the Dupont Plaza inferno the second worst hotel fire in U.S. history , surpassed only by the Winecoff Hotel blaze in Atlanta in 1946 , which killed 119 . Most of the victims died in the casino , and the rest were found in hallways and rooms on the first four floors . <P> . Days after the tragedy , investigators were still searching through the rubble , looking for clues about how the inferno started . Fire officials labeled the blaze suspicious and raised the possibility that it had been set by disgruntled union members engaged in a bitter wage dispute with the hotel . But the latest evidence , according to Puerto Rico Governor Rafael Hernandez Colon , has led investigators to speculate that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effort to discredit the union . Said Hernandez Colon : " We suspect there may be arson because of the very tense labor situation that existed . "
