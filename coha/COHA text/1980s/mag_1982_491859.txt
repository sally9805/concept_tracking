" THE INFINITE RICHES OF BEN FRANKLIN " The unsurpassed range of his gifts and the important uses to which he put them have earned him the modern sobriquet , " America 's first conglomerate . " by Frederic A. Birmingham Chapter One Benjamin Franklin , the most extraordinary American who ever lived , could do almost anything . And everything he did was a whopper . He dared Britain 's King George III ; he dazzled France 's Queen Marie Antoinette ; and he galvanized the lightning of the heavens . In a spare moment , he invented the armonica , which gave out musical tones of such silvery sound that Mozart and Beethoven momentarily cast aside their symphonies to compose music especially for Ben 's plaything . That great intellect , Thomas Jefferson , concentrating on writing the Declaration of Independence , turned for help from Benjamin Franklin as simply as a student might ask his own father for advice . Why not ? Franklin was the greatest American writer of his day , and his wisdom was the bedrock of our nation . Instead of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their tribal laws , especially those of the Iroquois Confederacy of the Six Nations  --  and adapted them for our own Articles of Confederation , the forerunner to the Constitution of the United States . He won the Revolution for us  --  by bringing in France against the British when the American forces were almost done in . A century before the Civil War , Franklin was president of the Philadelphia Society for the Abolition of Slavery . He fathered The Pennsylvania Gazette , precursor of The Saturday Evening Post , in 1728 , nearly four years before George Washingtonwas born . Paper is so expensive these days that we could not possibly afford to record everything about Benjamin Franklin here , although he surely deserves it as our progenitor . This irrepressible old rascal had such funds of love and goodness in him that his very own sister , Jane Mecom , disregarding all sibling traditions in the process , said : " I think it is not profanity to compare you with our blessed Savior who employed much of his time while here on earth in doing good to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And , lest we conclude this to be a mere case of sisterly hero worship , read the words of George Washington  --  not a man to stoop to praise for its own sake  --  in writing a letter to Franklin , September 23 , 1789 : " If to be venerated for benevolence , if to be admired for talents , if to be esteemed for patriotism , can gratify the human mind , you must have the pleasing consolation to know that you have not lived in vain . And I flatter myself that it will not be ranked among the least grateful occurrences of your life to be assured that , so long as I retain my memory , you will be recollected with respect , veneration and affection by your sincere friend , George Washington . " I have promised that there would be no whitewashes , that the critics would be allowed their say . So let us hear a few . Ben hardly needs a defender , but nevertheless , it appears that the ones who tried to put him down did so perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his life and in the centuries to follow . They seem to say : " Never mind payingattention to this fellow . Keep an eye on me , please ! " Dr. Samuel Johnson used a sneaky left hook on Franklin , observing that no American was worth talking about . ( Yet Boswell , Johnson 's devoted biographer , stole away from the master to visit Ben Franklin , whose sagacity was a challenge to the English lexicographer . ) John Adams , who had a prickly tongue himself , called Franklin the " vainest man and the falsest character I have ever met in life . " The French critic SaintBeuve : " All ideal is lacking in this healthy , upright , able , frugal , laborious nature of Franklin . . . . He brings everything down to arithmetic and strict reality , assigning no part to human imagination . " D.H . Lawrence , author of Lfuly Chatterly 's Lover , dismissed Franklin as a " snuff-colored little man , " who followed an " unlovely , snuff-colored ideal . " Mark Twain caught Franklin a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ animosity toward boys . " Franklin , said Mark with a twinkle in his eye , " had a malevolence which is without parallel in history ; he would work all day and then sit up nights and let on to be studying algebra by the light of a smouldering fire , so that all other boys might have to do that also , or else have Benjamin Franklin thrown up to them . Not satisfied with these proceedings , he had a fashion of living wholly on bread and water and studying astronomy at mealtime  --  a thing which has brought affliction to millions of boys since , whose fathers had read Franklin 's pernicious biography . " That same biography , which sold millions of copies and which has since been digested , condensed and issued in a four-volume edition , has been called the most influential book ever written in America . Carl Van Doren writes a nice summary of Franklin in the preface of his book on old Ben : " From Franklin 's beginnings as a journalist at 16 to his retirement from public affairs at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he was  --  and is  --  unsurpassed by any man in the range of his gifts and of the important uses he put them to . - A man who inspires hatred , envy and idolatry is worth looking into in any sense . So let me sum up just some of the innovations for which we can thank this incredible man : He invented the lightning rod , the Franklin stove , the smokeless chimney , bifocal lenses . He made the first important American contribution to the science of economics , laid the foundations of the State Department and , of course , served as the first American ambassador to a foreign country when he went to France during the Revolution . He founded or helped to found or introduce : the United States postal system ; the dead-letter office in the postal system ; the first American debating society ; the University of Pennsylvania ; the Philadelphia Fire Company ; the first American fire insurance company ; the Pennsylvania Hospital ; the first subscription library in Philadelphia ; street paving ; street cleaning ; street lighting ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ useful in basket-making . He encouraged the use of mineral fertilizer , the use of plaster in house construction , the construction of ships with watertight compartments and the culture of silkworms . These were not merely stabs in each of these areas , either . As Time magazine might put it , no dabbler he . He carried his interest in electricity deeper than flying a kite in a storm and getting a charge out of it . That led to his invention of the lightning rod , which has saved untold lives ever since . He was the first to use the terms positive and negative in connection with electricity . Then he went on to devise an electric battery , something the automobile industry is just now appreciating as a source of powerful energy , and he built a sizable generator to produce electricity from his own sources of energy . In 1753 , he became the deputy postmaster for all of the colonies , which required him to travel often . The experience convinced him that the colonies were really a unity , and he was one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The late Marshall MacLuhan once remarked that the first form of communication was a road . Franklin had put teeth into that-300 years before  --  by urging improved roads between the colonies , and as a byproduct , he invented an early odometer that was attached to the axle of a cart to indicate how far it had traveled . Franklin also wrote papers on such diverse subjects as magnetism , chemistry , medicine , scientific farming and animal behavior . That is a mere list of what he did . The man himself was far more fascinating . He was just , very simply , a great human being . It has been said that he spoke six languages  --  no wonder he became such a skilled diplomat ! We mentioned the armonica , the musical instrument he invented . It was played by touching one 's fingers to rotating glass hemispheres . Franklin also wrote chamber music for a string quartet of no mean quality and taught himself to play the violin , the harp and  --  the modern touch  --  the guitar . Benjamin Franklin had in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day , a word which meant character and dependability . He also had what we called " heart , " both in terms of courage and in love for his fellow man . As for courage , he was brimming with it . Flying that kite in the teeth of a thunderstorm was dangerous , and he knew it . Several European scientists were electrocuted trying to emulate him . Franklin simply figured the risk was worth the possible benefit to all mankind . It is not generally known that , characteristically , Franklin never tried to patent any of his inventions . " As we enjoy great advantages from the inventions of others , we should be glad of an opportunity to serve others by an invention of ours ; and this we should do freely and generously , " he wrote . It is comparatively a small matter , a sideshow in the grand spectacle of le grand Franklin , but the man was also an accomplished swimmer and famous for it in his time . He had learned as a boy , jumping in and out of Boston @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curiosity to learning the art . Of course , he became an authority on it before he was through . He did n't quite get as far as scuba diving , but he did invent a pair of fins to improve his speed , and he amused a great many of his friends by using a kite as a sail while swimming . " I found , " he wrote , " that lying on my back and holding the kite 's stick in my hands , I was drawn along the surface of the water in a very agreeable manner . " Typically , he delved into a French swimming manual by Theyenot and memorized its 39 chapters , which described a medley of complicated strokes , each of which he practiced to perfection . While crossing the Atlantic in the relatively small ships of the time , Franklin made it a habit to amuse himself and his fellow passengers by jumping overboard and disporting himself in the deep waters . If you 've ever done this , there is a subtle hidden factor involved : You can drown just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as in an ocean several thousand feet deeper ; but it does n't take an overactive imagination to be much more aware of water a mile deep than ten feet down , especially when you are paddling in it , The result of all this , Ben Continued on page 86 ? Jan . Feb. ' 82 Franklin continued from page 53 Franklin being the person he was , is contained in his Art of Swimming Made Safe , Easy , Pleasant and Healthful , printed in London . Franklin put his swimming theories into spectacular practice in England . Once , on a boat trip on the river Thames from Chelsea to Blackfriars , to the great astonishment and admiration of his companions , Franklin stripped and swam the entire return trip . This excited so much gossip over the feat that one of England 's foremost political figures , Sir William Wyndham , proposed to hire Ben , who was a young fellow at that time , as a swimming coach for the politician 's two sons at a handsome fee . For a time , it opened up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school in England ; we almost lost him for better things . The same thought occurred to the great Thomas Carlyle , who once said : " He might have stayed here and become a swimming teacher , but God had other work for him . " On the more serious side , Franklin was also far ahead of his time . As our ambassador abroad during the Revolution , he functioned also as our first " CIA operative . " He was in constant touch with John Paul Jones during the famous seadog 's audacious raids on the coast of England in the teeth of the gigantic British Navy ( sinking a few English ships on the way ) . In truth , Jones ' ship , the Bonhomme Richard , was named after Franklin 's famous literary creation , Poor Richard 's Almanach . Franklin fought against the evils of slavery 100 years before the Civil War . Only two months before he died , he had the courage to sign a petition to the First Congress urging that slavery be abolished . Franklin was also centuries ahead of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only liked women , he understood them . He believed seriously in the intuitive instincts of the female . " All inferior animals put together do not commit as many mistakes in the course of a year as a single man within a month , even though this man be guided by reason ... . This is why , as long as I was fortunate to have a wife , I had adopted the habit of letting myself be guided by her opinion on difficult matters , for women , I believe , have a certain feel , which is more reliable than our reasonings . " He believed in mutual consideration in marriage : " Treat your wife with respect . It will procure respect to you , not only from her but from all that observe it .. .. Never use a slighting expression to her even in jest ; for slights in jest after frequent bandyings are apt to end in angry earnest . " Franklin 's famous maxims reflect the same indulgent quality about women , particularly wives . He could be sharp once in a while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ briskly enough : She laughs at everything you say . Why ? Because she has fine teeth . " ' " Mary 's mouth costs her nothing , for she never opens it but at others ' expense . " These are biting little portraits . But his maxims had many styles ; more often they came from the heart : " A home without a woman and firelight is like a body without soul or sprite . " We can hardly give a rounded portrait of Benjamin Franklin without setting forth his now-famous advice on taking a mistress . For a long time , this letter was considered either to be too rough or too much in bad taste for public consumption . It was not until 1882 , when the U.S. government came into possession of the Henry Stevens collection of Franklin 's manuscripts , that the " Choice of a Mistress " work came to light . For years , it was deliberately hidden away even from the most serious historians . It was feared that the letter would " shock modern taste . " But by 1926 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to print the whole letter in his Franklin biography , and 15 years later , it was published in Max Schuster 's A Treasury of the World 's Great Letters as one of that anthology 's prize exhibits . Our only warning is to remind the reader that when Franklin makes out a case for " old women rather than young ones , " he was going with the attitude if his time : that after something like 25 years of age , a won , in is no longer young . In other words , he is recommending older young women , as we would see them today . " My dear Friend , I know of no Medicine fit to diminish the violent natural inclinations you mention ; and if I did , I think I should not communicate it to you . Marriage is the proper Remedy . It is the most natural State of Man , and therefore the State in which you are most likely to find solid Happiness .... But if you will not take this Counsel , and persist in thinking a Commerce with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that in all your Amours you should prefer old women to young ones . You call this a Paradox , and demand my Reasons . They are these : 1 . Because as they have more Knowledge of the World and their Minds are better stor 'd with Observations , their Conversation is more improving and more lastingly agreeable . 2 . Because when Women cease to be handsome , they study to be good . To maintain their Influence over Men , they supply the Diminution of Beauty by an Augmentation of Utility . They learn to do a 1000 Services small and great , and are the most tender and useful of all Friends when you are sick . Thus they continue amiable . And hence there is hardly such a thing to be found as an old Woman who is not a good Woman . 3 . Because there is no hazard of Children , which irregularly produc 'd may be attended with much Inconvenience . 4 . Because thro ' more Experience , they are more prudent and discreet in conducting an Intrigue to prevent Suspicion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to your Reputation . And with regard to theirs , if the Affair should happen to be known , considerate People might be rather inclin 'd to excuse an old Woman who would kindly take care of a young Man , form his Manners by her good Counsels , and prevent his ruining his Health and Fortune among mercenary Prostitutes . 5 . Because in every Animal that walks upright , the Deficiency of the Fluids that fill the Muscles appears first in the highest Part ; The Face first grows lank and wrinkled ; then the Neck , then the Breast and Arms ; the lower Parts continuing to the last as plump as ever : So that Covering all above with a Basket , and regarding only what is below the Girdle , it is impossible of two Women to know an old from a young one . And as in the dark all Cats are grey , the Pleasure of corporal Enjoyment with an old Woman is at least equal , and frequently superior , every Knack being by Practice capable of Improvement . 6 . Because the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be her Ruin , and make her for Life unhappy . 7 . Because the Compunction is less . The having made a young Girl miserable may give you frequent bitter Reflections ; none of which can attend the making an old Woman happy . 8thly and Lastly . They are so grateful . Thus much for my Paradox . But still I advise you to marry directly ; being sincerely , Your affectionate Friend " Although the basic tenet of the letter has some gallantry in it , Franklin oversteps the line a couple of times in a way no woman , young or old , might especially take as a compliment . His humor contains that seed which made some of Ben 's contemporaries just a bit leery of him . He just might crack too many jokes , given his head  --  a complex man , compounded of nobility and the very soil itself . ' A
