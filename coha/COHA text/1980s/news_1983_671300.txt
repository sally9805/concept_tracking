" I may have been insufficiently sensitive to concerns some may have about the practice of recording telephone conversations ; accordingly I discontinued the practice. " // No Federal or District of Columbia statute makes it a crime for one party to tape a telephone conversation without the knowledge or the consent of another . But legal experts say that at least 13 states , including California , Florida and Maryland , have criminal statutes prohibiting such taping. // <> <> Callers Recognize Contents // The New York Times has obtained transcripts of some of Mr. Wick ' s telephone conversations , which all took place in 1982 , that his callers say must have been taped , although they did not know it at the time. // Transcripts were read to Senator Mark O.

Earle , 32 years old , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I have the impression that such a thing happened . " He added : " I ' m not aware of a specific instance where the director taped a call without warning. " // Mr. Earle , who is a Foreign Service officer , said that he had warned Mr. Wick that such a practice was an invasion of privacy and " in nobody ' s interest . " Mr. Earle said he believed that Mr. Wick had " no intention to subvert anything , he just pushed himself to the physical limit to find out what ' s going on. " // In the interview with Mr. Wick , which took place in his rented home in the Northwest section of the capital , the director , who is 66 , said that he was an inveterate user of a Dictaphone. // <> <> He Says Dictating Unit Was Moved // He said that when the agency moved into a new building in May , the Dictaphone system he had used in his previous office was moved into his new office .

Hilbert , said an examination of his files showed that Mr. Wick ' s office had bought a " microcasette desktop Dictaphone unit , Model 3891 " which was capable of making recordings of telephone conversations . The telephone recording on this model is activated by a light touch of the finger on a control. // Asked if he had any audio tapes made from telephone conversations in his possession , Mr. Wick , who is a lawyer , replied : " Not to my knowledge . " When the question was repeated , Mr. Wick said : " It ' s not my practice to have them. " // Mr. Wick , who angrily refused to continue the interview after 15 minutes , acknowledged that he had been warned " some time ago " by Jonathan W. Sloat , then the general counsel to United States Information Agency , that he should not tape without permission. // <> <> He Concludes It Is Illegal // " That ' s when I became concerned about how it might look with some of the word going around , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then examined the laws and regulations concerning taping and had reached the conclusion that it was illegal to tape over the telephone without the other party ' s permission. // Although such taping is not illegal under Federal statutes , the American Bar Association and many state bar associations say it is unethical for a lawyer to tape a telephone conversation without the permission of all participants. // Asked specifically if he had secretly taped Mr. Hatfield , Mr. Adelman and Mr. Annenberg , Mr. Wick said he had not. // According to current and former aides , Mr. Wick ' s office procedure called for daily notes to be typed from cassettes from his Dictaphone .

" I never knew that I was being recorded , " said Mr. Hatfield . " I would have liked to know whether I was being recorded . I don ' t appreciate it. " // <> <> Adelman Is ' Surprised ' // Mr. Adelman , who according to a transcript also spoke to Mr. Wick in October 1982 , said he recalled the conversation , which was about the nuclear freeze , but did not know of the taping .

Mr. Annenberg , who has invited Mr. Wick to his annual New Year ' s Eve party with the President and top Administration officials , said he had no idea he was being taped. // " To my memory , nobody - nobody - has ever asked my permission to record a conversation with me , " Mr. Annenberg said. // Mr. Wick taped the younger Mr. Weinberger in March 1982 regarding his job performance . Mr. Weinberger said he had no knowledge of the taping but did not find anything unusual about it . " I am not bothered by it , " Mr. Weinberger said. // One of the transcribed telephone conversations made available to The Times showed that Mr. Wick spoke to Ambassador Swaebe while he was at United States Mission to the European office of the United Nations in November 1982. // <> <> Conversation About Linkletter // Mr. Swaebe , now Ambassador to Belgium , who described himself as a longtime friend of Mr. Wick , said he recalled the conversation , about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home in Geneva .

Mr. Douglas added that while in principle he thought an individual should be informed he was being taped in a telephone conversation , " Frankly , from my point of view I don ' t care.
