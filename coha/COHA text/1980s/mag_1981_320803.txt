After eight years as mayor of Los Angeles , Thomas Bradley , 63 , remains a diffident and elusive figure . " He does n't tell anyone his private thoughts , not even me , " his wife Ethel once said . Nor is he given to fiery outbursts , one-liners or gabbing with reporters . Says he : " I prefer to work quietly behind the scenes rather than get into a big public debate that accomplishes nothing . " Politically he describes himself as " fiscally conservative and liberal on other issues . You can not pin me down . " <P> That proved a problem for Republican Sam Yorty , who was swamped by Bradley in last April 's mayoral race . " He does n't offend people because he does n't take a stand on anything , " gripes Yorty , who defeated Bradley in 1969 but lost to him four years later . By and large , the mayor 's understated ways have earned him almost worshipful respect . " Tom Bradley 's cool under fire , " says Governor Jerry Brown . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ League : " He is one of our heroes . " <P> The son of a Texas sharecropper , Bradley moved West with his parents at age seven in a used Model T. His father struggled to support the family as a waiter and railroad porter and eventually separated from his wife . During the Depression the Bradleys had to accept public assistance , in those days the equivalent of welfare . A gifted runner , the 6-ft. 4-in . Bradley won an athletic scholarship to U.C.L.A. but quit school to join the city police department . After 21 years on the force , he used the law degree he had earned at night to start a practice . In 1969 , following six years of service as a city councilman , he made his first bid for mayor . <P> Bradley considers crime " the No. 1 problem " he has faced as mayor : " It 's unexplainable and it 's frightening . " In 1980 Los Angeles had a record 1,023 murders , in contrast with 490 when he took office . Bradley has doubled the police budget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inflation . To his chagrin , a plan to raise additional revenues through a special tax was defeated in a referendum last week . <P> Problem No. 2 is the budget-particularly the exorbitant costs of municipal police and fire department pensions . In fiscal 1982 pensions will cost the city $238 million , or 760 for every dollar of salary . In the past , handouts from the state legislature allowed the city to meet these expenses . Thanks in part to cutbacks mandated by Proposition 13 , which slashed state tax revenues , Los Angeles is facing an $80 million deficit ; Bradley has already laid off 400 city workers and cut library hours and recreation services . Warns the mayor : " Unless we have a charter amendment to slash the pension funds , the only departments we 'll be able to finance are police and fire . " <P> Critics accuse Bradley of not doing enough to promote mass transit in the city of freeways . <P> Some blacks believe he should have pushed harder for school desegregation and civil rights .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
