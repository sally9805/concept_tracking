The sentence was the first given to a member of the movement among church people opposed to United States policy in Central America to provide sanctuary to illegal aliens from the region. // Miss Merkt , 29 years old , called the sentence unexpectedly lenient . Nonetheless , it was considered an ominous sign for the sanctuary movement. // The Administration says many of the participants in the movement are motivated politically to undermine United States policy in Central America. // Members of many established churches say , however , that their efforts are humanitarian acts to protect people from persecution , torture and death in their homelands. // Church sources say more than 100 churches in the Southwest , the Middle West and the New York area , and possibly as many as 140 , are harboring and helping Salvadorans. // The movement has been building for some time , but it was only recently that the Immigration and Naturalization Service began to arrest some of its leaders . In addition to Miss Merkt , who plans to appeal her conviction , at least two others have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agency has not raided any churches or church-run refugee centers to arrest Salvadorans . Instead , agents have apprehended Salvadorans after they leave the sites operated as sanctuaries. // Today at the Casa Oscar Romero , where Miss Merkt works , about 20 Salvadoran refugees were living openly . The refugee center is in a white house in San Benito operated by the Roman Catholic Diocese of nearby Brownsville . The sanctuary trend has been a source of growing concern to the Government . The Administration has said that while it has granted political asylum to some Salvadorans in this country , most are " economic " migrants seeking better job opportunities , the motive the Government has attributed to most migrants entering illegally from Mexico and other countries. // What makes these cases so difficult for the Government is that the sanctuary concept has the backing of many church officials , including Bishop John J. Fitzpatrick of the Diocese of Brownsville. // " We do not feel we are breaking any laws , " said Hernan Gonzalez , the diocese ' s director of Christian services . " Service to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We have no choice but to assist them for humanitarian reasons . No one denies the existence of death squads in El Salvador . This is the closest point on American soil to El Salvador. " // A bill in Congress , which is opposed by the Administration , would grant what is called " extended voluntary departure status " to Salvadoran refugees in this country so they could legally live in the United States on the same temporary basis that permits stays by refugees from Poland , Afghanistan and Lebanon . <> <> Judge Sentences Violator // // Today the growing dispute between the Government and the sanctuary movement focused on a courtroom here . Federal District Judge Filemon B. Vela , in pronouncing sentence on Miss Merkt , said : " I know you are a person of high principle , but violating the law is not the way to go. " // He spoke after Miss Merkt , convicted by a jury May 13 , said she felt she broke no law and acted only under " Biblical mandates " to extend her hand to the suffering. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 000 deaths there , " she told the judge , referring to El Salvador , " mostly all civilians killed by Government forces . The Reagan Adminstration continues to support that Government , the Government that creates the refugees. " // The church-run refuge where Miss Merkt works is in a quiet working-class section of San Benito . Outside , a sign calls for a halt to American " agression " in Central America . Inside , the refugees sleep in male and female dormitories . Today , beneath a graceful mesquite tree behind the house , a group of nuns and lay people held a prayer vigil after the sentencing. // Miss Merkt , a lay worker from Colorado , was arrested in February near McAllen , Tex. , while driving three Salvadorans to San Antonio . The Salvadorans are still in the country awaiting deportation hearings. // Later , the director of Casa Romero , Jack Elder , 41 , was arrested on charges of taking three aliens to a bus station in Harlingen , Tex . He faces trial later this year . <> <> More Charges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ added four aiding-and-abetting charges Tuesday to an earlier indictment of Philip M. Conger , arrested in March for transporting four Salvadorans . Mr. Conger , 26 , who heads the Tucson Ecumenical Council Task Force on Central America , now faces a total of eight charges . He was arrested near Nogales , Ariz. , after Border Patrol agents found the Salvadorans in his vehicle. // It was in Tuscon in March 1982 that the Southside United Presbyterian Church began the nationwide sanctuary movement . <> <> ' Safe House ' in New York // // The network of aid to Central American refugees is growing rapidly , as coalitions of human rights , solidarity and legal aid groups join the sancutuary movement . Recently , the congregation of the Riverside Church in Manhattan declared it an official safe house , one of several in the metropolitan area. // " The idea comes from the original Judeo-Christian concept of sanctuary , where persons fleeing the law could go to places of worship and be protected , " said Marianne Lundy , a member of the sanctuary committee at Riverside. // Estimates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York area rages from 40 , 000 to 70 , 000. // According to Verne Jervis , a spokesman for the immigration service in Washington , 16 , 637 illegal aliens from El Salvador were apprehended last year , up from 11 , 762 in 1980 . He said that beween last October and April , political asylum was granted to 249 Salvadorans , or about 3 percent of the 7 , 867 who requested it . Mr. Jervis said 20 percent of entrants from all countries who seek such status get it. // <> <> Discrimination Denied // Mr. Jervis denied the charge made by many in the sanctuary movement that these figures represented political discrimination against refugees fleeing a country allied with the United States . He said that all cases were judged individually . " They are not looked at on a nationality basis , " he said. // He also denied that the agency had begun to take special measures against leaders of the sanctuary movement , saying that Miss Merkt and the others arrested recently had simply been caught as a result of routine enforcement measures. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service on asylum cases , Elliott Abrams , Assistant Secretary for Human Rights , also disputed suggestions that the Government was politically motivated or that most Salvadorans who had been apprehended would be persecuted if sent home . " The fact is a very large proportion of them are not refugees , " he said . " They are economic migrants. " // He said the State Department had investigated several hundred cases of deported refugees and found no instances of torture or murder. // Members of the sanctuary movement have disputed State Department statements that deported refugees are not persecuted. // Bills pending in Congress sponsored by Representative Joe Moakley , Democrat of Massachusetts , and Senator Dennis DeConcini , Democrat of Arizona , would give special status to fleeing Salvadorans . The Administration opposes those bills . A similar provision is contained in the version of the comprehensive immigration bill passed by the House . The Senate version of the bill does not include the provision. //
