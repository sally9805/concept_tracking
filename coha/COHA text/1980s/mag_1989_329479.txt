Patricia Szymczak was 36 years old when she decided to pursue a quest she had contemplated since childhood : finding her mother . Adopted in infancy , Szymczak , a reporter with the Chicago Tribune , attacked the task as if on deadline . She knew the woman 's name and hometown from a 1953 Illinois adoption decree , obtained when she turned 18 from her adoptive mother . Szymczak called the local post office , found a retired mailman and got him talking about the family  --  her family . She contacted old neighbors , who led her to friends . Some had seen the woman , who now lived out of state , at a recent high school reunion . Finally , she got her phone number . <P> But before tremulously placing the call , Szymczak journeyed to the tiny public library in her mother 's hometown 300 miles from Chicago . " My fantasy , " she explains , " was to open a high school yearbook and see a woman who looked like me . " On page 15 of the 1952 yearbook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same one Szymczak saw in the mirror ; the graduation quote : " I 'm just the girl you 're looking for . " The long search ended with a three-hour call from a pay phone . By the end of the conversation , it was after midnight on the second Sunday in May . Patricia Szymczak smiled and wished her newfound relation a happy Mother 's Day . <P> According to the North American Adoption Congress in New York City , there are more than 60,000 Americans engaged in quests like Szymczak 's : mothers anxiously seeking children they gave up at birth , children hunting for their biological parents . Desperate , obsessive , their searches have , over the past two decades , ceased to be merely a matter of individual effort and have become a national movement . There are more than 450 support groups for searchers . Many conduct meetings modeled on Alcoholics Anonymous , in which new participants rise with the passion of the converted and state their mission : " I 'm Sarah , and I 'm looking for my daughter born on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movement are the N.A.A.C. and ALMA ( Adoptees Liberty Movement Association ) , which lobby to change state laws protecting the confidentiality of adoption records . Three states  --  Alabama , Alaska and Kansas  --  have completely open records , available to all adoptees over 18 . Other states require the consent of a birth parent , the child and one or both adoptive parents before documents may be unsealed . <P> Those intent on recovering their past often start by contacting one of the voluntary registries set up by 22 states to match adoptees with birth parents who are looking for them . The most successful effort is the International Soundex Reunion Registry in Carson City , Nev. , a private , nonprofit center that since 1975 has matched more than 2,200 people . <P> The seekers sometimes hire " search consultants " and go to great lengths , even illegal ones , to find their kin . " I 'm calling about a probate matter " and " I 'm doing genealogy " are typical little white lies . Many justify their actions with the claim that they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into giving up an illegitimate child . Their anger and desperation have led some psychologists to conclude that adoption leaves a permanent wound . " Birth parents and adoptees are amputees in our society , " says Los Angeles psychologist Annette Baran , who specializes in adoption- related counseling . Says she : " I think reunions are excellent , even when the outcome is bad . "
