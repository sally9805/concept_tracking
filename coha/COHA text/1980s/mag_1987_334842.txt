To avoid raising false hopes among cancer victims , researchers tend to use caution in reporting even the most promising advances in treatment for the dread disease . Yet two articles published in last week 's New England Journal of Medicine , while containing caveats , seemed reason for guarded optimism . Both dealt with a controversial treatment known as adoptive immunotherapy , which involves the use of a naturally produced substance , interleukin-2 ( IL- 2 ) , to bolster a patient 's immune system . Both reported striking improvements in some patients with advanced cases of cancer . <P> Dr. Steven Rosenberg of the National Cancer Institute , a principal author of one of the papers , stressed that the technique " is an experimental treatment in the infancy of its development . " Still , he said , " it is a first step in a new direction of cancer therapy . It can work . The challenge is to improve it . " In an accompanying editorial , Dr. John Durant of Philadelphia 's Fox Chase Cancer Center wrote , " Perhaps we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ successful immunotherapy for cancer . " <P> Rosenberg is most widely known as the spokesman for the team of doctors that performed colon surgery on Ronald Reagan in 1985 . At a nationally televised press conference he began his remarks with the chilling statement " The President has cancer . " But Rosenberg also created news 16 months ago , when he and his NCI team published their initial reports about IL-2 therapy on humans , which the press generally heralded as a cancer " breakthrough . " <P> Although Rosenberg says he never used the word , he was criticized for prematurely implying it . Dr. Charles Moertel of the Mayo Clinic argued that the technique was prohibitively expensive and that the side effects ( including fever , fluid buildup and irregularities in kidney and cardiovascular function ) were " unacceptably severe , " and suggested that the press had overplayed the potential benefits . <P> But the new results , on a larger test group , confirmed the earlier findings . Rosenberg and his colleagues used the technique on 157 cancer patients with melanoma , non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considered untreatable . What is more , the affected tumors were metastatic  --  that is , they had spread to other sites in the body . Of the 157 patients , 20 had at least a 50% reduction in tumor size , while complete remissions were produced in nine . ( Four patients died from side effects of therapy . ) The second paper , by Dr. William West and a team of physicians and scientists affiliated with Biotherapeutics Inc. of Franklin , Tenn. , showed similar results ( though no complete remissions ) with IL-2.
