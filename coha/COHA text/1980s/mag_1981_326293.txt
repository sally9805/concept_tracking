A Texas touring company finds opera a home on the road <P> Faint hearts need not apply . That goes for fatties too : a brochure declares proudly that there are " no two-ton Teutons in our company . " Still , it takes more than just a strong voice and a presentable shape to join up with the Texas Opera Theater . <P> A certain amount of vigor is required to get through the Houston-based company 's long days ; counting time for travel , set assembling and performances , the crew can work as many as 20 hours on a day when the main company is on the road . And it will be traveling for twelve weeks of this 36-week season , in which TOT is scheduled to give 233 performances in 57 cities , towns and hamlets . A tolerance for long bus rides and fast-food joints is also helpful . Yes , TOT members should have a deep love of opera . But they also must not recoil at the idea of performing La Bohme on the gym floor of the junior high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bathrooms in the lobby of the high school in Show Low , Ariz . New recruits are advised to keep their voices in shape and their pioneer spirits ready ; they will need both for the next publicity appearance at a shopping mall or an upcoming condominium dedication . <P> Sex appeal does not hurt either . It never does , of course , but it turns out to be especially practical when performers are sent to melt hearts and open wallets at the local Lions Club , or to strut and sing their stuff in front of thousands of noisily skeptical fans before the start of a game at the Astrodome . " We 'll get in any door we can , " says Jane Weaver , 33 , TOT managing director . " We have to be flexible enough to play in a high school gym as well as a 2,000-seat auditorium . " That frequently exercised adaptability , says Baritone Robert Galbraith , one of TOT 'S standout voices , is " the wonderful thing about us . We can take opera anywhere . " <P> It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps even more wonderful that its members want to , and are willing to put up with almost any touring mishap and slap-happy road-company misfortune in order to let people in places far from regular opera companies sample a little Puccini or get a glimpse of Rossini 's Cinderella . In characteristic down-home fashion , a TOT invitation for that work urges , " Come see Cinderella win out over her two grasping stepsisters . Come see her wed the handsome Prince . " Notes the Houston Grand Opera 's general director , David Gockley : " Opera tends to be a stilted , exotic , expensive kind of entertainment that rules out a great deal of the population . " Gockley founded TOT in 1974 precisely to break down the high-falutin image that opera still has in the boonies , as well as to create a training ground for emerging talent . <P> The best of the young performers - all but one of the singers are under 30 - can expect to join other TOT-trained artists who have gone on to big-city companies , which do not hire inexperienced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explaining why he joined TOT : " It 's all in your head until you get a chance . They gave me a chance . At Chicago 's Lyric Opera , they want Toscanini. "
