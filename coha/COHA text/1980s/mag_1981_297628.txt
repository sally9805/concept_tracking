For correspondents assigned to cover the White House , press briefings and scheduled events constitute only a modest part of their daily duties . Much of their information comes from private conversations with officeholders , who often provide background or personal observations . For this week 's cover story on the inner workings of the Reagan Administration , White House Correspondents Laurence Barrett and Douglas Brew drew on knowledge built up over months of reporting on Reagan and his executive " troika " - Presidential Counsellor Edwin Meese , Chief of Staff James Baker and Deputy Chief of Staff Michael Deaver . Says Barrett : " To know how the minds of these men work it is necessary to spend time with them at meals , on the tennis court , in a fishing boat , or just hang out with them . " <P> Barrett is no newcomer to the lively exercise of White House watching . As a Washington reporter from 1962 to 1965 for the New York Herald Tribune , he assessed the first 18 months of the Administration of Lyndon B. Johnson . Thirteen years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eleven months . Barrett has found Reaganites are more accessible and more tolerant of press criticism than Johnson and Carter people . Says Barrett : <P> " During the Carter Administration , stories considered unfair or off base by the White House often resulted in ill-tempered lectures from a senior staffer . But Reagan usually takes this kind of thing in stride , and so do his subordinates . One way to measure an Administration 's sense of balance is to watch the way it reacts to criticism . " <P> Brew 's association with Reagan and his staff dates back to last year , when he occasionally pinch-hit for Barrett on the Reagan campaign trail . Brew stood watch outside Reagan 's Pacific Palisades home during the presidential transition period . Since then he has reported on the President 's Inauguration , the attempted assassination , and his Thanksgiving at the Reagan ranch near Santa Barbara . " Reagan keeps a civilized 9-to-5 schedule and does n't take off at the drop of a hat to strange places around the world , " says Brew . " His aides may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but Reagan always looks as if he just stepped out of a hot bath . "
