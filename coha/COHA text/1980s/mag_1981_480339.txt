I SLEPT very little in those days . I had gotten into the habit of going to bed as soon as the day 's slow fade-in began . Going to bed at dawn has at least one advantage : the day is well spent ? asleep . When one is resting , what else matters ? I was at Merano finishing up The Trial of Maria Tarnowska , a screenplay I was doing with Luchino Visconti . Four exhausting months in a hotel room where Luchino kept us under lock and key , prisoners . Guido Piovene , Antonio Pietrangeli , and myself . At Merano I had made three friends . I could relax with them ; we never had to worry about anything . My three friends were a very young girl from Udine named Sandra , a twenty-four-year-old German woman whom everybody called Grethe but whose name was n't Grethe , and an American captain whose age was about thirty-six . We had very little in common , but for us that little was a great deal : the need to invent our evenings , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the small hours . The story I am about to tell concerns one of those evenings . I tell it because it has remained in my memory like a film , the kind of film I have always wanted to make but have never been able to . a mechanism not of facts but of moments that speak of the secret tensions in those facts , as flowers reveal the tensions in a tree . I tell the story because it was an evening controlled by invisible glances . In short , it was an unexpressed tragedy . The characters of a tragedy , the setting , the air that is breathed there , the moments that precede and follow it , when the act is irrevocable but unspoken ? all these are more fascinating to me than the tragedy itself . The tragic act makes me uneasy . It is abnormal , excessive , shameless . It should never occur in the presence of witnesses . In reality and in fiction , it excludes rne . T HE FOUR of us are in a jeep heading for the border @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fallen . The head-lights shine on houses with wooden balconies full of geraniums and every now and then a cross appears . Long stretches of the road are stony and dusty . Rocks spring into view where the asphalt ends , and a dry wind lifts the dust and drops it on our hair . The captain drives in silence . The rest of us look at the shadows thrown by the headlights . The gaiety we felt a little while ago has vanished , overwhelmed by a silence that would seem inexplicable were it not for the fact that we 're approaching the border , and borders always command a little respect . Or rather they make us cautious , especially at night . Only when the jeep slows down and stops in front of an isolated house do we stir . The door is open ; the interior is illuminated by a fierce light . " Gasthaus ? " asks the captain . " Ja , Gasthaus , " answers the man at the door . He is young , blond , very young . Even though I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . His is an answer in spite of itself . " Okay , " says the captain . 75 Grethe has jumped down from the jeep . She has a lean , elastic body . One would think that she spends hours exercising or dancing to be so supple . When I asked her about it , she answered me with another question : " What do you think ? " Strange girl . I see her exchange a glance with the blond young man and then look around . There are other houses ; none is lit . She looks at them as if they were listening . Behind the young man another has appeared in the doorway , a much older one with a drooping mustache . He is fat , enormous . Against the light he seems the gigantic , threatening shadow of the first man . He looks at the captain , who has moved to go inside , but does n't budge an inch . " Excuse me , " says the captain . He speaks with a heavy American accent . The two men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ astonished . His capacity for being surprised by everything makes him sympathetic , neutralizes the distance from which he , an American , regards us . Grethe goes over and says something in German . The two men move aside . As soon as we go in , Sandra begins to laugh for no apparent reason as she pokes about the place . When she walks , she rocks on her legs like a little girl who wants to be noticed but only makes a nuisance of herself . The blond man appears before her , somewhat impatient , and directs her to a small room that the captain has already entered . I hear him saying loudly , " Eat ... essen . " He is trying to sound cheerful but produces the opposite effect . Grethe , in fact , becomes serious ; cheerfulness does n't suit her much . She is very beautiful when she is serious , and she is often so . She collects her thoughts , turns in upon herself , or simply withdraws ? in other words , she becomes distracted , and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why . The first time I saw her she had a bunch of flowers in her hand and suddenly she offered me them . I did n't know what to do with them and said so . I also pointed out to her , rather rudely , that mountain flowers have no smell . " Flowers are more beautiful to look at than to smell , " she objected , and turned away from me . One of her moods had fallen on her . T HE WALLS of the small room where we sit down are paneled in natural wood , and the tables and chairs are of the same material . There is also a porcelain stove with a bench around it , underneath an overhanging bunk . It is so typical that I would like to leave . I am not fond of the Tyrolean style . The captain , however , seems right at home . He orders sausage , prosciutto , bacon , beer , and pumpernickel . The blond man writes the order on a pad and disappears . I draw closer to Grethe . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drink beer and then taking advantage of her . But the thought vanishes as soon as she turns around to explain to me : " This is Andreas Hofer 's house . Do you know who he is ? " I do know . He was a Tyrolean patriot who was shot in Mantua after being denounced . I know another detail : the informer 's name was Schrafll , which is also the name of the man who owns the inn . But I do n't know if it 's the fat one who 's the owner . He has the appearance of a man involved in the sorrow that must pervade the inn because of that name . The house has aged well . The wooden interior offsets the bright exterior walls , the window boxes filled with the usual geraniums , the sharply slanted black roof that dissolves into the black sky . " Wait , " Grethe says . She goes to meet the blond man as he comes back into the room . They exchange a few words , and then he opens a door , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enter a dark room . I hear the click of the light switch , and Andreas Hofer is there , in a corner , with a flag in his hand . It is a life-size painted wooden statue , so slick and shiny it seems made of wax , and , seeming waxen , seems like Andreas Hofer in person . On the walls are some faded newspaper clippings : Hofer making a speech , Hofer at a secret meeting , Hofer kneeling before a platoon of Na poleonic soldiers with blue uniforms and very long rifles , in a squalid barracks courtyard reminiscent of La Grande Illusion . In the room there is also a table , and on the table is a visitors ' book . Grethe puts the pen in my hand with the most natural of her gestures and does n't notice that I put it back on the table without signing . It is my personal protest against the blond man , whose consideration for us thrives on such diffidence . Meanwhile , he has walked quickly toward the door . Before he closes it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ backpacks slung over their shoulders . They are followed by a third , without a pack . The clothing and ruddy face of this last man betray his mountain origins , but the other two have the pallor of city people . Even with the door closed we can hear Sandra and the captain laughing . The blond young man keeps a hand on the doorknob and an eye on Grethe , while following me with the other . He is thinking some obscure thought about me . In the square of the window , illuminated by the lamp at the entrance , I see the three men with the backpacks moving away , stopping for a moment , and then disappearing into the darkness . Hofer looms at my shoulder with the flag in his hand . Grethe stands beside me . I observe in her the same restless calm I feel . More to break the silence than to satisfy my curiosity , I ask : " Con-traband ? " The blond man is wary of replying . I turn to Grethe , a little annoyed . " Listen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't give a damn about what 's happening in this place , and neither do I ... She interrupts me . " He understands Italian very well . " " Fine . " I would like to add that I too have a certain interest in the subject of contraband : let me watch and maybe explain the details to me . It 's a purely professional curiosity . At Merano I heard talk about this traffic in goods , and perhaps in men , those who are escaping other men or a law . But I say nothing . I do n't even have the desire to talk to him . T HE DOOR to the room is pushed from outside ; the blond man opens it . It 's Sandra . " This dump must be at least a century old . " she says impatiently , " but that 's no reason to make us wait another century to eat . I 'm hungry . " At last Grethe smiles and we all go off to the dining room . We sit down in a corner , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absence , I do n't know by whom . The captain fills the tankards , raises his in a triumphal gesture , and then lets it fall on the table . The tankard does n't break , but the beer splashes everywhere . The captain looks at us happily , as if he had only been waiting for the party to begin . Sandra takes a napkin and starts cleaning the table . Her bare arm passes in front of Grethe several times , and Grethe , with one of her more natural gestures , caresses it . Her gesture is instinctive , gentle , and sensual at the same time , a sensuality that seems to contain the sweetest sentiment , like that of Bergman 's three women in his stupendous Smiles of a Summer Night . It 's such a discreet gesture that it does n't need to he completed , and , in fact , there is n't time for it . Some mysterious presentiment induces Grethe to interrupt her caress a fraction of a second before some sounds from outside reach the table , making the bottles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a car backfiring , or several cars , or perhaps it was a voice , or several voices , nearby or far , I could n't even tell which . I do know that it ( or they ) had the same emotional charge as a scream . Meanwhile the blond man has started for the door . He has opened it to go out , but he is forced to stop in his tracks . Some hurried footsteps are heard in the hallway . Someone must have told him to stay where he is . I have never seen a face more annoyed . No , he is more than annoyed ? dejected . As if receiving an order in our presence were a humiliation . The captain takes advantage of the situation and points a finger at the young man . " You ! " he says . But he also stops . We seem to be waiting for the result of the noises . But they fade away without leaving a trace , and the silence returns to what ought to be a good silence , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ticking of the clock , which heighten it . I look outside the window . I do n't feel that this darkness belongs to a mountain night , dense and still like the mountains , an old , solemn night . Rather , I feel it may have been put there to hide something ? who knows what : movements , gestures , expressions , thoughts ? that we do n't have the right to see and understand , The captain resumes in Italian : " What 's this place called ? " Grethe answers , " San Leonardo . " " Like my uncle , " exclaims Sandra . Grethe leans her head back , revealing her throat , and says something to the blond man , who is by her shoulder . He answers and she translates . ( But why did n't he speak Italian if he knew it ? ) " He says we 're thirty kilometers from the border . " T HIRTY kilometers ... " I start to say , thinking : that 's a long way to walk . As if she had read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' huts and move on from there . There 's no chance of being stopped and searched . Sandra makes disjointed 77 gestures . " Humph ... but why ? ... " Her gestures and phrases are jerky . All eyes are on her . " Why are we talking about these things ? Is the prosciutto coming or not ? " Prosciutto , bacon , beer , and pumpernickel appear a few moments later , on two large platters placed in the middle of the table . The beer is bitter and goes straight to my head . The captain drinks it right down and urges Sandra to do the same . Sandra closes her eyes , takes a sip , and puts a hand on her chest , expecting a burp . " It 's so beautiful with all this foam ... " She dips her fingers in the tankard , scoops up a little foam , brings her fingers to her lips , and licks them with a grimace of disgust . " But I do n't like it . " " What about wine ? Do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of mixing the two flavors occurs to him . He laughs . It 's all to make us believe that he 's never had so much fun in his life . But only he is amused . He raises his wineglass to the light and looks at the tiny bubbles rapidly evaporating , a sign that the wine is genuine ... A moment of suspense . Everyone 's expectinc , him to drop the glass on the table again , but instead he gulps it down , smacks his lips , rolls his eyes , surveying us with a smile that does nothing but anticipate the banality of his remark , and says : " Kids , this is the life . " As soon as he says this , it 's clear that he is n't referring to the wine but to our being there around that table at that moment , feeling on top of the world , or at the bottom ? who knows ? with those other people out there on the mountain , that woman ... It is definitely a Conradian situation . " Grethe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of any originality , but there 's no escaping the fact that tonight we are the extras here . They are the protagonists I point to the hallway . Why do n't we take up our discussion where we left off ? " " What discussion ? " " The one we were having in jeep . " I mentally allude to her leaning on mine . " But we did n't say a word . " I look at her , disappointed , and she smiles , expecting me to continue . Instead , I look at the stove , the blue arabesques in the majolica that stop at the seams and jump over them as if they were fences , extending the pattern into the next tile . Suddenly I realize that I too am engaged in smuggling . I am smuggling a feeling for Grethe that I do n't have . Yet is n't this what we do every blessed day of our lives , making some of our feelings recoverable for any eventuality ? The dining room door creaks . It closes . The young blond man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which are made of wood and therefore reverberate , more shuffling , and then the captain shouts , imperiously : " Open the door ... aprire . " The door remains closed . The captain suddenly springs to his feet . He seems to do it against his will , as if it is n't like him to jump up like that . Three seconds later he is in the hallway . But here he finds himself right in front of the fat man , who makes an annoyed gesture to drive him hack to the dining room . With an agility no one could have thought him capable of . the captain sidesteps the man and plants himself in the middle of the hallway , determined to stay there , enchanted by what appears before his eyes . A woman is coming down the stairs . She is wearing a green scarf tied around her head , dark pants , and climbing boots . She is pale , and her face looks worn . " And who 's that woman ? " asks the captain . The two Austrians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hands in his pockets and shifts his weight onto one foot , standing like someone who is prepared to wait . Not that the men will answer him ? he knows very well they wo n't but rather for the change , for the effect produced by the woman 's entrance on the scene . T HE WOMAN has stopped on the last step . It 's clear that she is in a hurry to leave and that the half-drunk man standing between her and the door is an obstacle that she 's not sure how to deal with . But she is n't worried . In fact she seems to be thinking that the situation is n't so serious after all . It could become serious , however , which is why she 's hesitating . What the captain probably ca n't bear is that indulgent glance she bestows on him , and he reacts as best he can , summoning up all the savoir faire he can muster . He makes a low bow and says : " Eine Dame zum Piaisir . " From a man like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell whether it 's an act of homage or an awkward attempt to joke about his being bent over for so long or an instinctive gesture of shyness . At any rate , he is in an uncomfortable position , difficult to maintain . I exchange a glance with Grethe . We should go to his aid , or Sandra should appear at the door of the dining room . But none of us makes a move : Sandra because she 's intimidated by something she does n't understand ; Grethe and I because ; though we do n't say it , we really want the captain to fall over so the woman can leave . At this point , realizing he is wasting shots , the captain changes his strategy . As is usual with people who are accustomed to drinking , he rises from the bow completely in control of himself , turns toward me , and winks , indicating the woman with an imperceptible nod . Thus he immediately enlists me as an ally in his cause , forcing me to reconsider the situation along with him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's strange that I did n't notice her beauty before . Perhaps it 's the way she 's looking at him , with that pale shadow under her eyes setting her face in high relief . and her erect figure , which makes me look at her in a different way . What I do n't understand is why she endures the captain 's provocation . Moreover , I have no dear sense of what she 's thinking . From the way she looks at us , she seems to guess that all the forces she has challenged tonight are united in us . We are the norm , the daily routine : we are the law , conformity , even power . Or , simply , we are ballbreakers . For us , on the other hand , she is the unforeseen element , the diversion . We need her to give a meaning to our performance , as it were . We can not let her escape . This is certainly what the captain wanted to convey when he winked at me . Grethe moves forward and stands beside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invitation to intervene . Grethe is German and stares at the back of my neck like a German . I take the captain by the arm and push him toward the dining room . He is docile now ; I can entrust him to Sandra . When I turn around , the woman is talking to Grethe . Her voice strikes me as toneless , as if she is trying not to attract attention . It 's a brief conversation , strangely confidential . They say goodbye , squeezing each other 's hands like two old friends . Once the woman has gone , we all gather around the table again and begin to eat . But the situation has changed . We have changed . The prosciutto , the bacon , the wine have a different taste . I ask Grethe what she was talking to the woman about . " Nothing . She 's in trouble , " she answers gravely . I never get tired of looking at her face . Every feature requires careful examination . The only thought that my gaze can extract from her seriousness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when she gets up about half an hour later . " Let 's go , " she says . We pay and leave . The man with the mustache accompanies us to the door and stops beside the blond man , who looks as though he 's never moved . The captain sizes them up with deliberate insolence . " What 's the matter ... he starts to say in English . We shove him into the jeep and I get behind the wheel . The two Austrians look at us from the door without speaking , motionless . They are there even after I 've turned the car around and driven onto the road . I 'm sure they followed our headlights slipping along the trees and disappearing . A FTER a couple of kilometers we stop . The captain has seen trees full of apples at the top of the slope that flanks one side of the road , and he wants to pick some of them . We walk up a hill in silence but ca n't reach the orchard , which is still hidden by a thicket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the moon comes out , and the grass looks green again . A kilo of blue is more blue than half a kilo . Gauguin said . Here nature has applied tons of green . We cross the clearing , mainly from a need to move forward , to reach some other part of the forest . In front of us appears some seemingly impenetrable undergrowth . We brush past it for a short distance until we find an opening where a path begins . We set off along it . For a path in the middle of the forest it 's curiously straight , curiously exact , ineluctable as the probably hostile multitude of trees that regard us with indifference . The moon filters through the branches , creating alternate zones of light and shadow , and we move on from light to shadow , for some reason trying not to make any noise . The captain and Sandra very quickly abandon the path , with the excuse that the apples are in another part of the forest . Grethe and I continue . We will meet them back at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their echo runs through the valley , leaving behind a vague sense of anguish . Anguish , not fear . Those shots were not intended for us . If I had a rifle , I too would have shot it , just to enter into the enigmatic atmosphere of this night . At a certain moment Grethe takes me by the arm and points to something among the foliage . We draw nearer . At the edge of another clearing , narrower than the first one , there are two figures , a man and a woman , illuminated by the moon . I prefer the light of the day to that of the night , the dazzling light of the sun to that of the moon , no matter how suggestive the latter may be . But even though the figures are illuminated by the moon , the scene is not idyllic . It is a scene that would remind me of the park in Blow-Up if time had n't reversed the order of the two events . Blow-Up was still to come . The woman is the same one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inn . I do n't know the man . Never seen him before . He is thin , sure of himself , judging from his gestures . We hear her scarcely perceptible voice and , after a pause , his . They are about thirty yards apart , but they talk in quiet , whispery tones , as if they were standing face to face . Their voices alternate with perfect timing , without ever overlapping . I ask Grethe if she can catch what they 're saying . " A few words . They 're talking so softly . " Only now , at a distance of years , do I realize that I witnessed an event invented by chance with a precise and brilliant poetic intuition : an intimate , agonizing conversation between two people who are physically far apart . After a few minutes I hear a different kind of whisper , not in time with the others . It sounds like a sob . I look at Grethe ; she is the one who is crying . For the second time in the course of the evening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a gunshot . It 's closer than the ones we heard earlier , but I ca n't say whether it was the man who fired . This shot also grows faint in the air of the valley , and we are buried in silence , The woman . however , is no longer where she was standing . The man is still there , but he suddenly moves . He takes the longest time to cross the clearing , and he stops for just as long to look down at the ground where the woman was , where perhaps she still is , dead . But then he looks at the place in the forest where the woman could instead have fled . Both hypotheses cross my mind . Since the situation was so doubtful , I should have at least tried to reach the unknown man , to follow him . Why did n't I do it ? Why did I remain standing there , looking at the clearing , even after the man had disappeared and there was nothing else to look at , as if the shivering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force of inertia ? I recall that at that very moment a certainty suddenly flashed through my brain . There was absolutely no reason in the world for us to be there in that place at that hour . We were two useless witnesses , and I was instinctively rebelling by standing there . I put an arm around Grethe 's waist with no intention but to comfort her ( but why ? ) , and I lead her to the jeep . The others are already sitting in it . Sandra is eating an apple , as if it were breakfast time . The captain is a little dejected . His gaze is dull ; his eyes seem like leaves in the wind ( where have I read that phrase ? ) . We set off again . Grethe 's knee again touches mine , and that contact offers me a complicity so tender that I no longer have the desire to go back home . I make a U turn and we go off in the opposite direction . The road begins to descend , and I turn off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the white uncertainty of the road , heading for the border , listening in the silence to the gravel grinding softly under the wheels .
