The French Foreign Minister , Roland Dumas , said today that France could not take custody of the 39 Americans being held in Beirut unless they were turned over to the French as free men. // In Bern , a Swiss Foreign Ministry spokesman said that Switzerland was willing to welcome the captives " in its embassy in Beirut , but without any conditions , and with the assurance of being able to freely transfer them to Switzerland or wherever , and release them. " // Mr. Dumas , who made his comments on a radio interview here this morning , implicitly rejected an offer by the Lebanese Shiite leader , Nabih Berri , that the hostages be turned over to a Western embassy in Beirut on condition that they be held there until 735 detainees , most of them Lebanese Shiites , are released by Israel. // // Custody Role Refused // " We can not put ourselves in a position where we would substitute ourselves for the jail keepers , " Mr. Dumas said. // Referring both to the American hostages and to four French citizens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " They have the right to the freedom that has been denied them . That can ' t be negotiated and consequently the first difficulty is that we can not begin to bargain about it. " // Mr. Berri , in making his offer at a news conference Wednesday , specifically mentioned France and Switzerland as possible recipients of the 39 remaining hostages being held by Shiite militiamen in Beirut , setting off speculation here about a possible French effort to set them free. // However , the French have from the beginning been cautious in their public statements . On Wednesday , French Foreign Ministry spokesmen at first refused all comment on Mr. Berri ' s proposal ; they then issued a statement saying that France was " available " to help win the hostages ' release but stopping short of agreeing to take custody of the hostages . With his statement today , Mr. Dumas for the first time made that refusal explicit . <> <> Contact With U.S. and Israel // At the same time , even as official statements here have precluded a mediation role @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Dumas , have remained in regular and direct contact with American and Israeli leaders as well as with Mr. Berri , prompting continuing speculation here that a deal for the Americans ' release is slowly being hammered out with Mr. Berri. // " The action is delicate , " Mr. Dumas said in his radio interview today . " We have to conduct it with tact and that is what we are trying to do. " // Even as the French want to hold open the possibility of a peaceful solution to the crisis , they definitely do not , in the view of diplomats and officials here , want to take custody of the hostages and to hold them pending their final release , an act that would make France in effect an accomplice of the Lebanese hijackers , as some French officials privately put it today. // At the same time , France is concerned about its four citizens , two diplomats , a researcher , and a journalist , who were kidnapped in Beirut and are still being held by unknown terrorist groups . <> <> Release @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the possibility that 2 of the Frenchmen could be turned over to the French Embassy along with the 39 Americans , but French officials said here today that Mr. Berri raised the matter of the Frenchmen only as a possibility , saying he could not guarantee that the groups holding them would surrender custody of them. // The French Foreign Ministry , following the example of its American and Israeli counterparts , imposed a blackout today on virtually all comment on the hostage crisis . The Ministry refused , for example , to confirm or deny reports reaching here from Israel that Mr. Dumas told Prime Minister Shimon Peres of Israel last night that France would allow its embassy to be used as a sanctuary for the American hostages for two days , during which , presumably , Israel would release the captives it is holding. // Western diplomats here , who were generally skeptical that the hostages could be released into French custody , pointed out that Shiite militias control the area around the French Embassy in West Beirut . Thus , even if the hostages were to go to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would get safe passage from there to some point of departure , presumably either the Beirut airport or one of the city ' s port areas.  --   --  Swiss Respond to Berri GENEVA , June 27 - A Swiss Foreign Ministry spokesman said today that the Swiss position on the American hostages had been passed on to Mr. Berri and that the Government was awaiting a response. // " It ' s up to him to reflect on this now , " a Government official said privately , referring to Mr. Berri. // The decision came after an extraordinary meeting of the country ' s governing seven-member Federal Council in the tiny , isolated village of Quinten on Lake Wallenstadt in northeast Switzerland , where the councilors were on their traditional summer holiday. // Switzerland , which eschews membership in international organizations and treaties it might find compromising to its longstanding neutrality , offered last Thursday to make available its " good offices " to Mr. Berri in an effort to end the hijacking affair . But it has also asserted repeatedly that it was against negotiating with " hijackers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Swiss Embassy in Beirut is said to be a relatively small house and Swiss officials have said over the last few days that it would be too small to house 39 hostages for any length of time . But the Swiss position of agreeing to accept the hostages only if they could be flown here or elsewhere and freed , appeared to stem more from its position of not acknowledging a link between the hostages and the Lebanese prisoners , and less from logistic considerations. // Last week , Swiss officials said that they would try to help work out some sort of settlement in the hostage crisis . A Swiss official visited Beirut for one day , on May 13 , after a trip to Syria , and met Mr. Berri , other Lebanese factional leaders including the Druse leader , Walid Jumblat , and Lebanese Government leaders. //
