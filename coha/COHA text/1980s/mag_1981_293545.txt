For this week 's cover story on genetic engineering and its commercial applications , Reporter-Researcher Philip Faflick needed to confirm how many genes there are in a human cell . A call to the Time Inc. library promptly produced the answer : approximately 100,000 . Unearthing such arcana is routine for the library 's research staff . In recent months , it has been asked the gestation period of a cow ( 284 days ) , whether identical twins have the same fingerprints ( no ) , the height of the Venus de Milo ( 6 ft. 8 in. ) and whether worms swim ( yes ) . Sometimes a straightforward answer does not drive home the desired point , and the library prepares a more creative reply . For a story on the skyrocketing price of gold last year , for example , it calculated that a suitcase of the precious metal would buy a tanker of crude oil . " Anything we are asked we will try to answer , " says Chief Librarian Ben Lightman , who has been ferreting facts at Time Inc. for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the information ourselves , we will direct the writer or researcher to a reliable source or authority . " <P> Established in 1923 with little more than a Roget 's Thesaurus , a dictionary and a world almanac , the Time Inc. library has grown into the largest facility of its kind in the U.S. , with 25 professional librarians and 63 clerks , newspaper markers and indexers . Last year it processed 150,576 queries from the company 's various operations , 58,839 from TIME alone . The library contains half a million information folders on people , companies and news topics , 87,000 books and government publications and a running collection of several hundred periodicals . About the only thing it lacks is space , so extraneous or outdated materials are constantly being weeded out . Says Lightman : " We try to keep a rough balance between what comes in and what goes out . " <P> Pat Underwood-Rich , the head research librarian , earned her master 's degree in library studies at the University of Hawaii before coming to TIME in 1970 as a book cataloguer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Last October the Iran-Iraq war , the labor crisis in Poland and the approaching U.S. presidential election helped swell the number of queries for the month to 7,508 . " I think that was an alltime record , " says Underwood-Rich . " But I have n't had a chance to check it yet . "
