Voice firm and eyes unyielding , the former captain of the Polish secret police recalled the night of the murder . It was , he said , the first time he had struck a man " in my adult life . " He said : " I hit him at least two , most probably three or four times , in the area of the head . I have the impression I put something into his mouth . I do n't know if it was really like that or if it is a scene from a dream . " Pausing briefly , Grzegorz Piotrowski , the 33-year- old , soft-spoken former high school mathematics teacher declared : " That was the beginning of the whole catastrophe . " <P> Piotrowski and three other members of the Polish secret police  --  two lieutenants and a colonel , all now reduced to privates  --  are on trial for last October 's abduction and murder of Father Jerzy Popieluszko , a priest who was an unyielding supporter of the banned Solidarity trade-union movement . As Piotrowski took the witness stand last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Torun , many expected the ex-captain to confirm the prosecution 's original claim that the slaying was carried out with the knowledge and support of high-ranking members of the Internal Affairs Ministry , which oversees the secret police . But although he said that at one time he had mistakenly believed the orders to abduct Popieluszko came from " the top , " he allowed the stain of complicity to go no further than his immediate superior , Adam Pietruszka , a former colonel and the fourth man in the dock . Like two of his co-defendants , former Lieutenants Waldemar Chmielewski and Leszek Pekala , who testified two weeks ago , Piotrowski said he assumed that the idea to abduct the priest was sponsored by people senior enough to shield him from prosecution . " All the time , I was certain that this can not be Adam Pietruszka 's idea . But it turned out different , " he declared . <P> The testimony came none too soon for Poland 's Communist government . Although Polish Premier General Wojciech Jaruzelski has promised the trial will not be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be able to declare that justice has been served and that a widespread investigation is unnecessary . While Piotrowski 's confession shielded the powerful , it increased the chance that he would receive the death sentence . He appeared ready and willing to drag Pietruszka down with him . <P> Piotrowski described a meeting in late September in Pietruszka 's office , also attended by Lieut . Colonel Leszek Wolski , head of Warsaw 's local security office . Speaking of Father Popieluszko and Stanislaw Malkowski , another activist priest , the ex-captain recalled his superior saying , " Enough of this game playing with Popieluszko and Malkowski . We will take decisive action . We have to shake them so hard that it leads right up to a heart attack . " As Pietruszka sat impassively , separated from Piotrowski by two uniformed police officers , the former captain revealed that the victim was originally to have been Malkowski . Piotrowski claimed that he managed to dissuade his superior , saying , " Popieluszko is more dangerous politically . " When Wolski said he would have to inform his superiors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with superiors . The less they know , the smaller headache they will have . " About a month before the crime , said Piotrowski , the colonel called him into his office and allegedly told him , " I do n't think I have to add that this is a decision from the highest level . "
