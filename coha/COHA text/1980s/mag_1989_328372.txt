Both inside and outside the U.S. Supreme Court last week , the endless argument over abortion came to a critical confrontation . Outside there was a raucous standoff on the courthouse steps and plaza , where some 200 demonstrators , pro and con , sang , chanted and shouted . Inside , where the noise could not penetrate , the nine Justices were assembled to hear arguments in William L. Webster v. Reproductive Health Services , a case that could leave in tatters the pivotal Roe v. Wade decision that legalized abortion in 1973 . In both places many of the issues were the same . But inside , though the language was less heated , it had more weight . <P> During the one-hour courtroom session , attention was fastened upon the questions posed by the pivotal Reagan-appointed Justices : Anthony Kennedy , Antonin Scalia and Sandra Day O'Connor . Their inquiries to lawyers on both sides ranged far from the Missouri law restricting abortion to the larger question of where to draw the borders of privacy rights . Do these rights encompass abortion ? If not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Justices who regularly support Roe , only John Paul Stevens took an active part in the proceedings . Harry Blackmun , who wrote the landmark opinion , sat silently throughout . <P> Missouri Attorney General William Webster , the first to speak , attempted to minimize the impact of his state 's antiabortion law , which declares that life begins at conception and bars the use of public funds and public facilities such as hospitals to perform or assist in an abortion . The statute , which has never gone into effect , would also forbid doctors in publicly funded hospitals to " encourage or counsel " a woman to obtain an abortion . Webster argued that several of the law 's provisions would have little impact , implying that the court could uphold them without jeopardizing Roe . <P> It was former Solicitor General Charles Fried , called back by the Bush Administration to argue this case , who made the broad attack , presenting the White House argument that Roe should be overturned . In the most interesting exchanges of the morning , O'Connor and Kennedy appeared to press @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also undoing a crucial 1965 decision , Griswold v. Connecticut . In that ruling the court found that the right of privacy protects the decision to use contraceptives . Abortion is different , Fried replied , because it involves the purposeful termination of potential life . " We are not asking the court to unravel the fabric of . . . privacy rights which this court has woven , " he said at the beginning of his presentation . " Rather , we are asking the court to pull this one thread . " . <P> That line provoked the sharpest rejoinder of the day , from attorney Frank Susman , who argued on behalf of the Missouri abortion clinic that is challenging the antiabortion law : " It has always been my personal experience that when I pull a thread , my sleeve falls off . . . It is not a thread he is after . It is the full range of procreational rights and choices . "
