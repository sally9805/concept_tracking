It was a rude awakening for Joaquin Hernandez Galicia , the strongman behind Mexico 's oilworkers union . At about 9 a.m. last Tuesday , scores of federal police officers and troops surrounded Hernandez 's heavily guarded house in Ciudad Madero , northeast of Mexico City . Whether authorities first attempted to arrest Hernandez without force is unclear ; what is beyond dispute is that the lawmen used a bazooka to blast open the front door . When the battle was over , a federal agent lay dead and Hernandez and about a dozen other union officials and bodyguards were under arrest . <P> Immediately after the raid , the government announced it had found 200 automatic weapons and 30,000 rounds of ammunition in Hernandez 's house . Hernandez and his colleagues were quickly flown to Mexico City , where they were arraigned on charges of illegally possessing weapons , resisting arrest and killing a police officer . <P> As news of the arrests spread , oil-union workers staged strikes and demonstrations in several parts of the country . Gasoline supplies ran out in Mexico City and other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's end , however , strikers had returned to their jobs and gas stations were operating normally . <P> The raid , coming just over a month after President Carlos Salinas de Gortari took office following a campaign that promised major political and economic reforms , fueled speculation that Hernandez 's arrest was the government 's opening shot in its efforts to control the country 's powerful unions . For much of its 59 years , the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party ( P.R.I. ) has given considerable autonomy to union leaders in exchange for industrial peace and delivering votes at election time . <P> As the former secretary-general and current strongman of the 200,000-member oilworkers union , Hernandez , nicknamed La Quina , had built up a personal fortune and a large following among those beholden to him for jobs , education and health care . Many of the area 's poor people regarded him as something of a Mexican Robin Hood . The enmity between Salinas and Hernandez dates back to the President 's tenure as Secretary of Planning and Federal Budget in the administration of Miguel de la Madrid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oil union and Pemex , the state oil company , of inefficiency . <P> By boldly challenging La Quina , Salinas has perhaps signaled his intention to end the cozy relationship between the P.R.I . and corrupt labor unions . The President may have won the opening skirmish , but the war is not over . " They had to do it if they want to continue the restructuring of Mexico 's economy , " said a private economist . " They seemed to have planned it very well , but things could still go wrong . "
