Proles join with the middle class in the pleasure with which they contemplate their own names , which is to say , the assurance they derive from knowing that they are not as anonymous and replaceable , as society , in its dealings with them , seems to imply . This need is like that of little children who by similar means gain assurance of their identity and value : ' This is my very own shoe bag , ' ' My very own cup and plate , ' etc . Thus from one middle-class catalogue you can order His-Her wristwatches , with ' John ' on the face of one , ' Mary ' on the other . This feature will bring you pleasure countless times a day as you glance at your wrist to ascertain the time and find your own invaluable name there : what a comfort-you are somebody after all .
