that 1 out of 100 nonsmokers would get lung cancer from a lifetime ( 60 to 70 percent of his time ) in a house that had 4 picocuries per liter of radon present . For every 4 picocuries per liter increase in radon , there is a 1 percent greater chance for lung cancer in the from the outside , such as in the summer . Radon levels are lower in the summer because there are more windows open . " The EPA recommends that people make a short-term , preliminary got thousands of picocuries per liter in your house , you want to know right away . You do n't want to wait a year . " If preliminary tests indicate a potential hazard , more extensive testing should follow . Dr. Weisfenbach has been studying radon gas person breathing the radon-contaminated air during a lifetime of exposure . Dr. Weisfenbach explained that the EPA had recently adjusted this calculation to a 1 percent risk for every two picocuries per liter of radon over a lifetime 's exposure . " What the EPA is saying , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most important pollutant we 've ever faced . " We asked Dr. Weisfenbach more about the levels in Iowa . " The highest levels that are found in Iowa are not nearly as high as the levels found in Pennsylvania , for example , or parts of New Jersey , where they 've discovered 2,000 to 3,000 picocuries per liter on occasion , " he told us . " In central and eastern Iowa , levels may reach 15 or 20 picocuries per liter , and the average level in these parts of Iowa is higher than the estimated national average , " he said . Of the 42 houses Dr. Weisfenbach tested , 13 ? or 31 percent  --  had levels higher than 4.0 picocuries per liter . The average level for houses in and around Pella was Dr 2.1 picocuries per liter during the nine or ten months he had detectors in the houses . " And that did not include November , December , and January , " he added . " During those coldest winter months the radon levels are a little bit higher , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on to explain . " They change when the atmospheric pressure falls or when the wind blows or when people ventilate their homes front view screening of their homes to detect potential radon problems . Charcoal-canister detectors are available commercially for quick , inexpensive testing , and more expensive alpha track detectors are good for longer tests . The three-day test using charcoal testers " is a good , quick check , " Dr. Weisfenbach said , " because if you 've since 1979 , when he began his work at the University of Maine . Maine has high levels of radon in some houses , and " radon in water in Maine is quite high , perhaps one of the highest in the na- 4 tion , " he said . He pointed out that the concentrations of radon in water are not as important as the concentrations in the air . ( Retrotec USA , a company selling devices for detecting radon in water , reveals that 40,000 to 50,000 pica-curies per liter in water translates to approximately 4 picocuries in the air . ) There is very little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from deep wells may contain the gas . The radon/lung-cancer picture is still unclear ; the only certainty is the need for more information . Determining the incidence of lung cancer in nonsmokers would help isolate cases caused by smoking from cases caused by sources continued on page 62 We are searching for victims of primary lung cancer who have never smoked and have never lived or worked near smokers . If you are a victim of this type of lung cancer , please answer the questions designated for victims . If you have had a relative with lung cancer who never smoked and never lived or worked near smokers , please answer the second part of the questionnaire for that person , even though you may not know the answers to all the questions . S ix years can be a grade-school education . It can be an adolescence . It can be a prison term or a Senate term . For David and Julie Eisenhower , it was a period of being famous in a way that no one had ever been before , no one has been since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will ever be again . They were famous not for what they had done , but for who they were : the daughter of Richard Nixon , the grandson of Dwight David Eisenhower , linked to each other for better , for worse . For worse began in 1968 , when Nixon emerged from his six-year political exile to run for president . David and Julie , already engaged , were students  --  he at Amherst , she at Smith , two colleges then in the vanguard of campus radicalism . They hit the campaign trail for Nixon-Agnew ; all of a sudden , they became traitors to their generation . An author , Garry Wills , mixed up his kinship terminology a bit and actually called David a " Nephew Tom . " To be sure , they had their admirers , but that was a mixed blessing . Who wants to be the kids parents tell their kids to be like ? Say you were a hippie . How would you have reacted when President Nixon declared that his input from American youth came from David and Julie and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a New Yorker cartoon had its finger on things , as one suburban matron said to another : " I 'm sure the young Eisenhower boy and the Nixon girl do n't smoke anything strange . " In the spring of 1970 , campus organizers vowed that , on David 's and Julie 's graduation days , 100,000 demonstrators would descend on the Smith-Amherst area to protest the President 's policies . The couple did n't want to subject their relatives ? including David 's grandmother , 74-year-old Mamie Eisenhower  --  to that kind of abuse , especially since ill the college administrations said they could n't guarantee the families ' safety . So David and Julie did n't get to go to graduation . Three years later came the storm of Watergate . And there again , right in the middle of it , were David and Julie , the symbols  --  depending upon what side you were on  --  of what it was right with the nation 's young people or what was wrong with the nation .
