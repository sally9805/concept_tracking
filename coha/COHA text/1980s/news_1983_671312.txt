The National Republican Senatorial Committee is preparing similar ammunition for prospective challengers to incumbent Democrats , and as Ceci Cole , a spokesman for the committee , put it , " We have to remind people what Johnny-come-latelies the Democrats are to this issue. " // In mid-December , 16 House Democrats sent a letter to President Reagan , urging him to participate in a bipartisan effort to close the budget gap . But at times , the letter sounded more like a campaign broadside than an appeal for negotiations. // " Mr. President , " it said at one point , " we are disappointed by your apparent willingness to look the other way while the deficit danger escalates . " Representative Gillis W. Long of Louisiana was even more blunt , telling reporters that " President Reagan bears most of the blame " for soaring deficits that could exceed $200 billion in the current fiscal year . <> <> Goal Is To Avoid Specifics // As these signs indicate , budget deficits are already emerging as a major issue in next year ' s campaigns for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the strategy seems to be the same : Pin the blame on those on the other side , and impugn their ability to manage the economy , but avoid too many specific solutions of your own that could get your folks into trouble. // The issue is a troublesome one for members of both parties . Republicans , because of their long-standing opposition to deficits , concede that they are somewhat vulnerable on it . As an aide to the House Republican leadership put it , speaking of Mr. Reagan : " What hurts us , obviously , is that one of the premier proponents of balanced budgets is facing huge deficits , and we don ' t appear to be handling it very well . But I don ' t know that the Democrats have any more credibility in handling the problem. " // On the other hand , many Democrats were raised with the faith that deficits can help stimulate the economy and are not necessarily evil . Martin D. Franks , executive director of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee , admitted that " for a Democratic strategist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ irresponsibility involves undoing years of conditioning. " // " The whole world has turned upside down on this , " said an aide to House Republican leaders . <> <> Delay Called ' Unacceptable ' // Some lawmakers in both parties feel that budget deficits pose a major threat to the economic recovery , and warrant some political risk-taking . Senator Bob Dole , a Kansas Republican , held hearings on proposals to reduce the deficit earlier this month and Representative Richard A. Gephardt , a Missouri Democrat , warned that if Congress avoids the issue when it returns in January , no serious deficit-cutting could go into effect before the fall of 1985. // " That kind of a delay is simply unacceptable , " said Mr. Gephardt , one of the 16 Democrats who wrote to Mr. Reagan. // But the more common view was expressed by an aide to House Democrats . For Congress to act next year , he said , either Mr. Reagan has to lead the lawmakers , or a deteriorating economy has to frighten them . " For the moment , " he added @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a similar concern when he wrote to Mr. Reagan recently , asking him to tone down his requests for higher military spending . " The deficit will be so politicized during this coming session of Congress , " wrote the Illinois Republican , " that I am very concerned about the progress we will be able to make in reducing it in the fiscal 1985 budget . " <> <> Repeating Reagan ' s Promise // From the Democrats ' viewpoint , politicizing the deficit issue is useful because it gives them a chance to undercut the traditional belief that Republicans are better managers of the economy . That belief , say the Democrats , helped Ronald Reagan exploit the economic issue in 1980 and defeat Jimmy Carter. // According to Democratic polls , voters now give Republicans only a marginal edge when evaluating the fiscal responsibility of the two parties . " The President has forfeited a significant advantage he had three years ago on this issue , " said one Democratic campaign strategist. // One of the Democrats ' favorite devices is to repeat the President ' s own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they delight in pointing out that the combined deficits of the Reagan era far exceed the total deficits recorded by all Presidents from Harry S. Truman to Mr. Carter. // However , the Democrats admit that they will have trouble selling the deficit issue as long as the economic recovery remains strong . At a party conference in St. Louis last month , a local party worker , Richard Brinkman , summed up the problem when he said , " If people are back to work , they won ' t care about the deficits . " <> <> Talk of ' Mortgaging the Future ' // As a result , Democratic campaigners are trying to argue that deficits really do threaten to abort the recovery and do present the country with " a fiscal crisis of gigantic proportions , " as Representative Thomas J. Downey , a Long Island Democrat , put it . In addition , they are stressing that the budget deficits require more Government borrowing and higher interest payments down the road. // " When we talk about mortgaging the future of your kids - that sells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Congressional Campaign Committee. // But the aide to Republican House leaders pinpointed the heart of his party ' s counterattack on the deficit issue : the Democrats ' credibility problem . The Republicans are prepared to deluge voters with material detailing Democratic attempts to increase Government spending , even while they were bemoaning the budget gap. // " Most voters know the Democrats don ' t practice what they preach on that , " said V. Lance Tarrance , a Republican pollster based in Texas . <> <> ' The Problems We Faced ' // The corollary to that tactic is to convince voters that a generation of Democratic spending , not the Reagan Administration , is the real cause of the deficit dilemma . As a result , goes the argument , the Republicans need more time to clean up the mess they found. // " We have to remind people of the problems we faced when the President took over , " said Joseph R. Gaylord , executive director of the National Republican Congressional Committee . " We have to point out that the economy was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' s taken a turn for the better , and that it ' s dangerous to tamper with the recovery while it ' s going on. " // The Republicans also believe that so far , at least , Mr. Reagan has received a " relatively free ride " on the deficit issue , as Mr. Tarrance put it , and escaped the major share of the blame. // Mr. Franks , the Democratic strategist , reluctantly agreed . " My frustration is that Reagan seems to be getting away with it , " he said . " He ' s getting away with the biggest deficits in history and preaching about a balanced budget . When you think about it , that ' s a pretty good trick. " //
