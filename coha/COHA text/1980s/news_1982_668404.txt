DELTA TOWNSHIP , Mich. - If this were to be a big Republican year , a time to build on what was won in 1980 , then Richard Milliman would not have had to make an issue last week of the fact that Howard Wolpe is renting his modest house on West Willow road to the Leon Tillitson family . On the other hand , if this is going to be a big Democratic year , why is it that over in Lansing , Bob Carr seems edgy , possible a bit too pushy for his otherwise tailor-made constitutency ? And if this is to be a big Democratic year , how is Steve Monsma supposed to make it to Congress up in Grand Rapids without a major league television effort to bolster an otherwise bland campaign ? As always , this year ' s election campaign can be looked at two ways ; there is the forest and then there are the trees . The political forest is a big picture with the following distinct elements : recession , unemployment , reduced inflation , imprecise Democratic alternatives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words Social Security . The trees are real people running for office - individuals dealing with non-uniform accidents on the map that are called congressional districts . The more you look at the forest , the more it looks like the Democrats ' year ; the more you look at the trees , the more confused everything looks . Except here . It was just a year ago that the Reagan Revolution hit its high- water mark . Not only had the GOP recaptured the White House , taken control of the Senate and made major gains in the House , it was preparing for an assault on the suddenly vulnerable Democratic hold on the House of Representatives . Democrats all over the country , in the politicians ' language , were being " targeted . " One was Howard Wolpe , who in two previous elections had never won with more than 52 percent of the vote and had a liberal record to boot . His district in south-central Michigan is mostly composed of the cities of Battle Creek and Kalamazoo ; it generally goes Republican and was solidly for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no longer a target but an I-told-you-so opponent of Reaganomics . Borrowing a theme from a 50-year-old song , the come-on for a fund-raising lunch he ran in Battle Creek last weekend was " Person , Can You Spare $10 . " " Things are looking good , " Wolpe said , " but as you may have noticed , an awful lot of money has poured into the race . " If it has , it ' s about the only thing the Reagan Revolution has done for this recession-battered home of Kellogg ' s , Post Cereal , Checker Cab and Upjohn . Businessman Richard Milliman is dead in the water , which is why he foundhimself the day before Wolpe ' s lunch standing in a vacant lot here across from the house Wolpe owns but rents out to the Tilltson family . Milliman professed horror that Wolpe had no residence in his district , and solemnly promised to maintain his house down the road on Wagonwheel lane if elected . It would take a miracle . The Republican nominee ' s own polls disclose only one piece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least half the voters had heard of his name . This particular tree is an example of one trend about which no one argues any more this year : the Republicans have lost what once appeared to be a golden opportunity to realign political loyalties . LANSING , Mich. - Bill Marshall , the director of Michigan ' s AFL- CIO apparatus , answered with customary candor one morning last week when asked how it was that Bob Carr lost his House seat in 1980 to a young Republican named Jim Dunn . " It happened , " he said , " because some of us didn ' t do our job , and maybe Bob went around helping too many other congressmen . " Carr is a Watergate baby of the class of 1974 , who went from a solid 57 percent winner in 1978 to a slender 3000-vote loser in 1980 , while his district was going heavily for Reagan . In this year ' s rematch , Carr is facing what he calls " half an incumbent . " Because of redistricting , the area now includes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of any size , the city of Pontiac , where unemployment exceeds 30 percent . The issue that seemed to put Dunn over the top two years ago was national security . The 39-year-old contractor was , more than anything else , on the crest of a wave of opinion in the country that the US-Soviet military balance needed redressing on the American side ; Carr had been especially prominent in Washington as an activist for dovish causes . Since his 1980 election , Dunn voted to make Reaganomics a reality , but this year he has tried to cover his tracks , joining other so-called Gypsy Moths in voting to override Reagan ' s veto of a supplemental appropriations bill for 1982 . With both economics and spending priorities working againstDunn , Carr works hard to localize both issues . His problem , according to Democratic consultants and politicians who have been in the district , is mostly personal . He is not at ease in public , and what friends say is really shyness can appear at first blush to be aloofness . Carr ' s other problem , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether the district ' s enormous number of unemployed voters easily translates into votes . " It is not a simple proposition , getting them to vote , " he said . " This is one of those areas where you have people traveling around the country looking for work , and the sense of total despair others feel is not easy to overcome . Among the unemployed , voter turnout can run below 40 percent , compared to 60 percent with everybody else . " Right now , Carr is thought to be very slightly ahead , but the fact the Democrats do not have this seat won back this late in the campaign could be an indication in microcosm that the party ' s gains this year may not be spectacular . GRAND RAPIDS , Mich. - This is the center of a recently prominent congressional district . It was Gerald R. Ford ' s home and his home base until he went on to bigger things in 1973 . In the spring of 1974 , it was the site of an important special congressional election that was read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Watergate weakness when it was won by a Democrat , Richard VanderVeen . And in 1980 , this was a perfect place to measure the impact of Reagan ' s cottails . His 20-point margin over Jimmy Carter lifted incumbent Republican Harold Sawyer from a razor-thin margin in 1978 to respectable seven-point victory . This year , if the national trend were toward a landslide for the Democrats , this is an example of a seat that they should win . Interestingly , although Sawyer appears to be leading , an upset remains a distinct possibility . For an opponent , the Democrats chose the local state senator , Steve Monsma . That name is important . The reason : Dutch ancestry in this rare bastion of that ethnic group . The Dutch-Americans in this area are not particularly partisan , but their voting history has tended to be Republican , except when one of their own is on the ballot , as witness Monsma ' s consistent success in legislature elections . In addition to the economy and budget cuts , which plague Republicans everywhere , Sawyer must fight local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cutbacks and Social Security scares on the district ' s substantial elderly population . The former local prosecutor is also less than adored as a person ; charisma is not his strong suit , and he has no dedicated organization to rely on . Monsma , however , appears low-key almost to a fault . He is well over six feet tall , slender , moves stiffly and is clearly uncomfortable in a crowd . At a recent luncheon rally , he stayed in the background and let the visiting dignitary , former Vice President Walter F. Mondale , do all the talking . If the Democrats take all three of these seats next month , it would be a sign of a national landslide worth at least 30 new House members . Seen as individual races , that doesn ' t seem likely ; yet , if one prefers the forest to the trees , these are races that could easily go Democratic if enough dispirited Republicans stay home and the turnout is dominated by voters angry about the economy . But turning back to the trees , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is now in Jim Dunn ' s district and Steve Monsma ' s ancestors came to America from Holland .
