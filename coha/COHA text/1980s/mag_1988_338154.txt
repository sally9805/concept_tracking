Francois Mitterrand won a second seven-year term as France 's President on Sunday , with 54% of the vote against Premier Jacques Chirac 's 46% . The result was hardly startling after Mitterrand 's strong showing in the first round of balloting on April 24 , though the release of three French hostages in Lebanon last Wednesday seemed briefly to boost Chirac 's chances . Chirac failed to capture enough supporters of Jean-Marie Le Pen , the ultra-rightist candidate , who fared surprisingly well in the initial round . On the eve of his triumph , Mitterrand , 71 , outlined his plans for the second term with Time Inc . Editor- in-Chief Jason McManus , TIME Managing Editor Henry Muller , Assistant Managing Editor Karsten Prager and Paris Bureau Chief Jordan Bonfante . Excerpts from the interview and from written answers to questions submitted earlier : <P> Q. What have you learned about France during this campaign ? <P> A. I was astonished by the great number of young people at rallies and by their impressive support . That is new because the young ordinarily have reservations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different tone to our politics . They are very sensitive to anything that has to do with human rights , generosity , the Third World , culture , scientific research , the adventure of the mind , education , professional training and equal opportunity . They reject discriminations . For them , these problems supersede the others . <P> Q. What are we to make of the Le Pen phenomenon ? <P> A. The majority of French men and women who voted for the National Front always thought as they do today , but they used to vote for Premier Chirac 's party . Put simply , there has been a restructuring of the right because the Premier , given his obligations , could not go as far as Mr. Le Pen in responding to the aspirations and the needs of those people . <P> Then there is the phenomenon that has been analyzed long before us , by historians and sociologists since the beginnings of this century : where there is serious and durable unemployment , there is a push toward the nationalist right wing . Even when they lose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patterns . Logically , they should move to the left and vote Communist . No . They move to the extreme right . <P> There they join people excluded from everything  --  the unemployed , the homeless , those who live in dirty , crowded neighborhoods devoid of any city planning , mothers and fathers who can not find anyone to take care of their children while they still have to work . These people become desperate . They come from the left , but they vote for the National Front . <P> Q. What are your foreign policy priorities for the second term ? <P> A. Peace and disarmament . The union of Europe , that is , the completion of an economic Europe and the setting up of a political Europe . The intensification of an effort of the major industrialized nations toward the Third World . <P> I will encourage the United States and the Soviet Union to continue on the path of disarmament to which they have committed themselves at last . I shall do my best to hasten the start of negotiations on conventional weapons in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ based on deterrence , that does not mean either constant overbidding or redundancy , and that a reduction of the arms race is the logical complement of this strategy .
