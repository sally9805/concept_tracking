WASHINGTON  --  Aetna Life &; Casualty Co. won a temporary delay of a $4. 9 million judgment against it in an unusual health-insurance lawsuit that also involves allegations of conflict of interest by an Alabama Supreme Court Justice . U.S. Supreme Court Justice Lewis Powell granted Aetna a stay until the high court decides whether to hear the company ' s appeal of an Alabama Supreme Court ruling in favor of an Alabama couple that sued over Aetna ' s refusal to pay $1 , 650 in hospital bills . The Alabama court ordered Aetna to pay the couple $3. 5 million in punitive damages , a $350 , 000 penalty and more than $1 million in interest . An Aetna spokeswoman said the company felt it shouldn ' t comment now because the case is in the appeal process . The couple sued Hartford , Conn. - based Aetna for " bad-faith " failure to pay an insurance claim , a comparatively novel legal action that is being recognized in a growing number of states and is causing concern among major insurers over sizable damage awards . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Alabama Supreme Court upheld the award in an unsigned 5-4 decision issued last December that found " overwhelming " evidence of bad faith by Aetna . According to papers filed in the U.S. Supreme Court this week by Aetna ' s lawyers , T. Eric Embry , an Alabama Supreme Court justice who wrote the unsigned opinion , is himself involved in lawsuits against two other insurance companies for bad-faith failure to pay claims . Both cases , one in his own behalf and the other a class action , were filed in Justice Embry ' s name while the Aetna appeal was pending in the Alabama Supreme Court , the papers said . Reached at his Birmingham , Ala. , office yesterday , Justice Embry said only , " My conscience is clear . That ' s all that matters with me . " Geoffrey Hazard , a Yale Law School professor and expert in legal ethics , says judges ought to avoid the possibility of " bias that can arise " from personal involvement in " a different case that raises similar issues " to one before their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says , when the judge ' s own case involves an area of the law that is still evolving and that is being shaped by the court on which the judge is sitting . The concept of bad-faith failure to pay an insurance claim began to develop as a basis for lawsuits about a decade ago in California courts . The concept , which penalizes insurance companies when a court finds no reasonable basis for refusing to pay , gradually spread to other states . Insurance disputes traditionally were settled based on what the contract said , and punitive damages were rare . But John Dobbyn , a professor at Villanova University Law School , says the bad-faith theory " began blowing down the walls of the contract . Courts are saying that because of the insurance company ' s bad faith , there are no limits on damages . " The fact that Justice Embry wrote the Alabama court ' s opinion was disclosed in January , a month after it was issued . The disclosure came in a deposition Mr. Embry gave in his own lawsuit against Blue Cross @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the papers filed by Aetna . When Aetna lawyers asked the Alabama Supreme Court to rehear the case , they raised the question of whether a conflict of interest existed . None of the nine justices voted to rehear the case or expressed any ethical concerns about Mr. Embry ' s role . However , Chief Justice C.C. Torbert and Justice Hugh Maddox both said they had learned that they were potential members of Justice Embry ' s class action , which was filed in behalf of all state employees . Both said to " prevent any question " about their role in the Aetna case , they would notify the proper court clerk that they didn ' t want any part of the class action . Although the Aetna case is unusual , it isn ' t certain that the U.S. Supreme Court will agree to hear it . The legal issue of failure to pay an insurance claim and the awarding of punitive damages are matters of state law that are reviewed only rarely by the high court . Questions of conflicts of interest by judges also rarely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unless they are so outrageous that they may be unconstitutional . Lawyers for the Alabama couple told the high court , in opposing a stay of the damage award , " No evidence of such impropriety , particularly of a level to reach a constitutional question , is present here . " Justice Powell didn ' t give a reason for granting the stay . However , Aetna also challenges the constitutionality of an Alabama law that imposes a 10% penalty when a defendant loses a money judgment and appeals unsuccessfully . That issue is more likely to trigger Supreme Court interest . Credit : Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal
