Exercise B The energy industry 's proposals for a profitable energy future emphasize oil , gas , nuclear power , and coal because these are the sources in which they have invested heavily and over which they exercise tight control . Insofar as the energy companies are concerned about a transition to an economy that emphasizes conservation and renewable energy sources , they favor the same route that they see leading to all good things in life . Specifically , they urge higher oil prices , which will spur businesses and individuals to conserve while permitting the oil companies , blessed with high profit and any subsidies the government cares to give them , to explore the possibilities of solar energy at their leisure . However , for those who see the existing energy industry as part of the problem rather than part of the solution , this is nowhere near good enough . A response to the energy crisis which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health , and to most people 's purchasing power has to emphasize conservation in the short run and solar energy in the long run .

' Footnote // Exercise C The price of gold has been fluctuating widely recently . After being fixed for a generation at $35 , it has jumped as high as $875 and has changed as much as $145 in a single day . The main reason for the current gold rush is speculation . Thus , price changes feed on themselves so people frantically buy up or dump their gold holdings . Gold is not something for idle speculation . In spite of its mystique , it is being traded just like anything else . The price of gold is determined by the same forces of demand and supply as determine all other prices .

SUGGESTED ANSWERS Exercise A Answer The basic question being addressed is what should be done about foreign auto imports . There are two primary options . One is to impose restrictions on the assessment of auto imports . The second is to spur the domestic auto industry to higher productivity and research and remove excessive governmental regulation . Who will choose between these ? To a large extent , the government is the chooser . The Congress can impose import restrictions and can reduce restrictions .

Alternative Definitions of Economic Variables ? Typical Examples of the Influence of Definitions ? Alternative Methods of Measurement as an Indicator of Ambiguity ? Discovering Which Meaning of an Economic Concept Is Intended ? Capsule View ? Practice Exercises ? Your Turn to Practice ? Suggested Answers 26 HOW ARE THE KEY ECONOMIC CONCEPTS BEING DEFINED ? This chapter emphasizes the necessity on your part of inquiring how concepts with alternative meanings have been defined by the expert . You may want proximity to full employment to be used as a standard for determining the wisdom of a solution . But , if an economist who also emphasizes full employment as an economic priority is using a definition of full employment that is very different from your own , you will not necessarily want to accept the economist 's assessment of the effect of her or his proposed solution on " full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your concept of full employment . The point here is that how an economics concept is defined should often affect your reaction to the proposed solution . Your problem as a consumer of economic expertise is to discover which alternative definition is being used in the analysis . It would be nice if economists automatically provided definitions of key terms , but they often do not . Space or time limitations may cause an economist to be less than clear in defining key concepts . Economic variables like poverty or employment can be defined in many different ways . Without basic information about how economic concepts are being defined , you are not in a position to know whether or not you should agree with the analysis to which you are reacting . For instance , if you would prefer a different way of defining costs or benefits , you would understandably be reluctant to accept economics advice premised on definitions you do not embrace . Failure to inquire about the manner in which concepts are being defined would result in your acceptance of advice that you would have rejected outright @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were being defined . Always ask yourself : Are there alternative ways to define the key concepts and do I approve of the definitions apparently used by the expert ? In this chapter we examine the impact of definitions in economic analysis . We start by arguing that many terms have more than one acceptable definition , and the particular definition used will affect the outcome of the analysis . We then take a more intense look at the impact of definition on economics analysis . The role of measurement and its relationship to definition is examined . This chapter will also help you decipher which meaning an author has in mind when the author has not been explicit about the definition . // ALTERNATIVE DEFINITIONS OF ECONOMIC VARIABLES At first glance you probably feel that we all know what unemployment , recession , prosperity , and the size of government mean . However , the more you learn about economics , the more you realize that one of the basic reasons economists disagree among themselves is the ambiguity implicit in many of the more fundamental economic variables . For example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ definition of poverty is an economist using ? One type of poverty may be getting increasingly serious , while the other may be gradually disappearing . With respect to the current severity of poverty , it matters a great deal which form of poverty is being referred to . The amount of attention you will want to give to an economist 's professional reaction to the severity of poverty depends , in part , on that individual using a definition of the concept that matches yours . Often the power of an economic argument stems from the skillful use of particular definitions in pursuit of a particular policy solution . If you miss the ambiguity of an economic concept as it is being used by an economist , you may make commitments to economic proposals that you would have otherwise rejected . As a reader or listener , you have the definite right to insist that definitions of economic concepts be explicit , or at least clear from the context . Otherwise , you are being asked to make personal decisions based on a form of economic propaganda . Develop the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ key economic concepts . Then , before making a judgment about the quality of economic reasoning being offered to you , ask further whether the particular definition being used by the economist is acceptable to you . Let 's look together at an example of economic analysis and observe the power of definition in shaping the argument in a particular form : The most efficient way to achieve energy independence is to place a tax of $20 per barrel on imported oil . If we want to rid ourselves of dependence on foreign oil sources , we must price them out of the market . The competition would stimulate private research in oilsaving machines and in lower-cost fuel substitutes . With such a market-oriented solution to energy shortages , our energy crisis can be used as a stimulus to reduction of oil imports . 28 HOW ARE THE KEY ECONOMIC CONCEPTS BEING DEFINED ? Now reread the passage asking yourself how this economist defines an efficient achievement of energy independence . Does n't he seem to equate efficiency with the decisions resulting from a competitive market ? Are there alternative ways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are any number of competing definitions . For example , had efficiency been defined in terms of maximizing the number of poor people who can meet their heating and transportation needs , there would be a solid basis for disagreeing with the analysis in the passage . Higher prices would not make it more likely that these consumers would be able to purchase the energy they need . The point is that alternative definitions of economic concepts play a critical role in directing economic proposals . Thus , a clue to the economist 's purpose is contained in the definitions the individual elects to use . TYPICAL EXAMPLES OF THE INFLUENCE OF DEFINITIONS A few more common examples of economic concepts with multiple meanings should give you a greater sensitivity to the importance of checking the way ambiguous terms are being defined . The economist will sometimes tell you directly that a concept or variable is being used in a particular fashion . When definitions are made explicit , your task is easier . Simply examine the definition to see if it is compatible with your understanding or preferred use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first need to discover from the economist 's reasoning how she or he is defining a concept that has multiple meanings . Much economic analysis discusses the impact of economic policies on full employment . Most of those who are not economists regard full employment as denoting a situation in which everyone who wants to work has a job . However , among economists there is lively debate about the meaning of full employment . There is broad agreement among economists that there must always be some amount of unemployment during even the most prosperous periods because some workers at any point in time will be moving from one job to another . The consensus ends there , however . Some well-known // economists tell the public that full employment means that 92 percent or more of those in the labor force have jobs . Others with equally impressive credentials argue vigorously that at least 96 percent of the labor force must be employed for there to be full employment . ( While the percentages may appear insignificantly different to you , recall that they are multiplied times a huge base @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of approximately one million potential workers and their families . ) Hopefully , the next time you see a reference to full employment , you will pause and ask what version of full employment is being alluded to . The less employment an economist requires before labeling it " full , " the less that individual will be concerned with the employment effects of economic changes since , in his or her eyes , we have already met or are rapidly approaching that economic goal . In discussions of wage-price controls , inflation and oligopoly , economists often discuss " price distortions . " What does this mean ? In one context , economists argue that monopoly distorts the price compared to what the price would have been had the market been competitive . So the norm that the economist wants to use in this case to judge price distortions is the competitive market . Alternatively , price distortion could occur because of government intervention . For example , one group of economists argues that the most important reason for the energy problems we face today is the history of government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and distributing supplies of fossil fuels . The argument is that the government interference caused a distorted set of prices which , in turn , distorted our utilization of these resources . Here , distortion is being defined as a variation from the results that would have occurred from pure market solutions . If only , they argue , we had not let the government interfere in the market for energy , we would not have the problems we now face . Price distortions may also occur if the government does not interfere in markets . Consider air pollution . Before the Clean Air Standards Act was passed , we were forced to bear the cost of pollution not by paying higher prices , but in other ways . For example , air pollution causes sickness , so people living in areas where pollution is a problem tended to have more sickness than they would have had otherwise . Many economists argue that rather than forcing the population to bear the sickness associated with pollution , the 30 HOW ARE THE KEY ECONOMIC CONCEPTS BEING DEFINED ? cost of cleaning up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ product being produced . Such an economist would argue that unless the price of output includes the cost of cleaning up the pollution produced with the output , the price would be distorted . In this case , even in competitive markets , prices will be distorted unless government alters the pricing structure . So , in this example , the distortion is not contrasted to competitive prices . What prices are the " right " prices in the case of pollution ? The " right " prices are determined in a model where the economist attempts to determine how resources should be allocated . In this case , the right prices ? the prices from which distortion is measured ? are determined by the normative model that the economist uses . Clearly , economists may disagree about how that model should be formulated . Thus , what the " right " prices are may depend upon the expert . You , as a consumer of expertise about price distortions , must inquire into the economist 's version of " the right price " before you can tell whether price distortion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the word distortions that the economist using the concept does not approve of the prices . But is there more to the term than just a label attached to prices an economist does not like ? Usually there is . We can often learn a great deal about an economist 's perspective by examining what he or she is alleging to be the source of price distortions . If government is " distorting prices , " the economist is implicitly arguing that the market prices resulting from the interaction of supply and demand in the industry in question are somehow fair , efficient , or correct measures of relative resource values . As you evaluate such an argument , you would want to examine the worth of that presumption even though the economist forgot to include such an analysis . The same kind of reasoning applies when an economist argues that oligopoly is distorting cereal , cement , or soup prices . What is the alternative price determination mechanism that would yield undistorted prices ? Usually , such an argument about oligopoly 's distortion of prices is based on an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is certainly nothing necessarily wrong with these implicit definitions . Instead , the objective of this section is to sensitize you to the need to at least look for critical definitions as you make personal judgments about the desirability of particular economic advice . // A couple more concepts in economics with important alternative meanings are ( 1 ) economic costs and benefits , and ( 2 ) economic rationality . An economic change may cause effects that are costs to some economic actors and may well be regarded as benefits to others . Economists often assess the costs and benefits of various proposals and activities . By checking how costs and benefits are defined , you can gain a lot of insight into their overall perspective about what is and is not important . For example , suppose an economist includes in a list of costs " reduced membership in the Communication Workers of America . " It does not require an overactive imagination to recognize that many people would regard this same effect as a distinct national benefit . You will want to think about the extent to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the economist attempting to persuade you . Perhaps another brief example will impress you with the necessity of discovering how economic costs and benefits are being defined . Suppose an economist is discussing the cost of producing a ton of steel . Should the individual include the cost of the pollution that is also produced as steel is produced ? The answer depends on whether the economist wants to know the cost to the firm or the cost to society . Thus , the answer depends on whether or not we want the cost from society 's point of view ( society 's model ) or the firm 's point of view ( the firm 's model ) . The point is that the cost of even so concrete an item as steel is not unambiguously defined . You should be very alert when economists talk about costs and benefits . You will want to know how cost is defined and what things have been included in the calculation of cost . Rationality of the economic or any other variety is often in the eye of the beholder . " Economic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of us who use the term assume immediately that an economist using the concept is defining it just as we do . Yet any time you see some economic actor 's behavior being analyzed by an economist as rational or irrational , you will want to check twice to see if her or his use of the descriptive characteristic is similar to yours . Rationality literally means a reasonable and systematic approach to attaining a goal . Since the number of goals or criteria that economists may wish to pursue is so extensive , there can be an abundant number of rational behaviors ? each of which may be irrational to an economist seeking to maximize some other variable . 32 HOW ARE THE KEY ECONOMIC CONCEPTS BEING DEFINED ? ALTERNATIVE METHODS OF MEASUREMENT AS AN INDICATOR OF AMBIGUITY One method of knowing when to ask whether an alternative definition of an economic idea would be preferable is to ask the subsidiary question : Could the variable be measured in more than one way ? If so , the variables can be defined in more than one reasonable way . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For example , the employment effect of an economic policy can be measured by the increase in employment or by the net decrease in unemployment . If the policy in question reduces jobs in any respect or encourages more prospective workers to enter the labor force , the employment effect will differ depending on which measurement is used by the economist . Before you agree that the employment effect will be of a particular magnitude , check to see how the economist measured the effect . Another frequently used economic concept is social welfare . Suppose we were interested in the changing social welfare of Chicano Americans . Would we measure it by their share of national income , their unemployment rate , the proportion of them who own major consumer durables , or the number of Chicanos officially classified as poor ? Each statistical series would give a different result . If you do not approve of the definition implicit in the form of measurement , you should hesitate before agreeing with the economic analysis . DISCOVERING WHICH MEANING OF AN ECONOMIC CONCEPT IS INTENDED This chapter stresses the necessity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economic concepts . However , once you have identified a concept that is being used ambiguously , how do you determine which alternative meaning of the concept is intended by the economist ? One way to go about answering that question is to have in your mind a list of alternative definitions for key performance criteria like full employment . Attempt to fit each one into the economist 's analysis and see if the particular definition fits with the rest of the reasoning . // A principles text may be especially helpful in giving you such a list since most introductory texts will have some discussion of alternative ways to define specific economic ideas . Often this technique will not be enough to enable you to decipher how particular economic concepts are being defined . Several possible definitions may appear to fit . An alternative approach is to try to discover the definition being used by studying the economist 's reasoning . You want to ask whether the reasoning provided is dependent on a particular definition . This process of discovering definitions from an expert 's analysis is a very difficult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expert has been very careful about how the passage was written . Often you will have a hard time trying to figure out what definition the economist had in mind if he or she reveals only mere glimpses of how the conclusion was formed . Let 's look at an example of economic analysis and see if we can identify-the definition of a key ambiguous concept by studying the economist 's reasoning . The steps we will follow will be to : 1 . Identify the economist 's conclusion and reasons . 2 . Identify any ambiguous economic concepts . 3 . Infer the definition of the ambiguous concept from the economist 's reasoning . Apparently some of our economic difficulties are diminishing . One of our primary economic variables is rising ; the gross national product has climbed for the third quarter in a row . This rise is good news . It means that economic growth is occurring . The basic argument in the excerpt is that our rising growth rate is good news for the economy . Does that make sense ? One of the key distinctions in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you see references to income , expenditures , or wages , you will need to know whether the statistics have had the inflationary effect removed before they are quoted . In other words , have the money variables been translated into real ones ? You will probably be most interested in real variables because they are more descriptive of actual changes in purchasing power . Now look back at the excerpt . Are there any ambiguous concepts ? Yes . Gross national product is a form of aggregate income . Therefore , before you 34 HOW ARE THE KEY ECONOMIC CONCEPTS BEING DEFINED ? can react intelligently to the reasoning , you would need to find out whether the gross national product being discussed is in real or money terms . Can you tell from the excerpt what the analyst intended ? We ca n't . We plugged both concepts into the excerpt and the reasoning seems to fit both . So what exactly is the analyst saying ? If money GNP rose by 8 percent and inflation by 13 percent , you would hardly be justified in agreeing with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the analysis : Even though inflation has accelerated during this period of time , the standard of living of the average citizen has increased during these three quarters . By the addition of this sentence , the expert would have enabled you to react reasonably to her analysis . Focusing on the standard of living suggests that the analyst is concerned about real gross national product and economic growth in the analysis . Thus , if you consider real growth a desirable economic goal , you will find the rise in GNP good news indeed . CAPSULE VIEW The point of this chapter has been to suggest that the definitions that authors use need not be universally accepted . So , when you read a piece of economic analysis , you should wonder if there are alternative ways for key terms to be defined . The issue of definition is crucial since policy may hang in the balance . Would we want to pursue a policy based on the definition of full employment that says full employment occurs when all people who want to work at the going wage are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employment would generate a substantially different policy than a definition that says full employment occurs when 4 percent of the labor force is unemployed . We must try to figure out the definitions that the expert is using since his or her policy recommendation depends on the definitions , and you may not find these definitions appropriate . // PRACTICE EXERCISES For each of the next three samples of economic analysis , try to point out ambiguous terms and the impact of this ambiguity on the economist 's reasoning . Example A When a sugar farmer asks for import quotas , he is leading an assault on the virtue of the market . Import quotas are a human intervention into the workings of an impersonal market . Market prices for sugar are said by the farmer to be unfair . Yet , who would you prefer to rely on as a determinant of equity ? Congress or contending groups of buyers and sellers in the market ? Example B The need for national health insurance is most clear if we focus on the inadequate health services now available to the poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per year is positively correlated with income . Poor people are not hesitating to visit doctors because they are more healthy , but because they lack the financial resources to pay for the visit . Additional evidence for the depressed nature of health services for the poor is the comparative infant mortality rates of blacks and whites . Since blacks more often lack prenatal care , their infant mortality rates are almost double the white rates . Apparently , the poor have the most to gain if we adopt a generous form of national health insurance . 36 HOW ARE THE KEY ECONOMIC CONCEPTS BEING DEFINED ? Example C Government efficiency can not be achieved simply by having toughminded budget administrators in each department attempting to resist pressures for wasteful expenditures . Instead , the solution lies in the application of benefit-cost analysis at every level of government . Before an expenditure is made , there should be a comparison of benefit-cost ratios for alternative expenditures . YOUR TURN TO PRACTICE Exercise D Wage price controls inevitably lead to distortions in the economic system , which can be minimized only in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect , the harder it is to discern real from artificial price and income signals . No matter how cleverly any group designs a control system , distortions will appear . // SUGGESTED ANSWERS Example A Answer The essence of this excerpt is that import quotas are undesirable because they interfere with the price structure set in the sugar market . The primary element of ambiguity in the quote surrounds the meaning of the term market . Chapter 8 is devoted entirely to a discussion of the different forms that markets may take . If the economist who wrote this paragraph had in mind competitive markets , her assessment of the quality of market decision making would make more sense . However , if she is referring to actual sugar markets replete with noncompetitive pricing strategies , then the contrast between prices resulting from import quotas and imperfect sugar markets is less clear . The point is that the ambiguous use of " market prices " does not give you , the reader , enough information about the author 's reasoning to enable you to agree or disagree without clarification of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you should support national health insurance because it would have a tremendous positive impact on the poor . You remember that there are often many ways to measure an economic concept . One illustration of the multiplicity of possible forms of measurement is reflected in this quote . The " poor " can be measured in dozens of ways . On the extremes are economists who see 40 percent of Americans as poor and others who argue that no one is poor in our economy . Notice the impact of assuming one or another of these measurement techniques is the best one . The more poor we count , the greater the significance of the reasoning in excerpt B. If hardly anyone is poor , then you should not get particularly excited about this argument for national health insurance . Now go back to the excerpt and see if the author gave you any clue about how he prefers to measure poverty . We could n't find any . Thus , the ambiguity of the excerpt complicates our reaction to it . We can not simply agree or disagree . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notice that the economist does not clearly distinguish between the poor and blacks ? The last three sentences focus on the benefits of national health insurance for blacks . While the 38 HOW ARE THE KEY ECONOMIC CONCEPTS BEING DEFINED ? proportion of blacks who are poor exceeds the proportion of whites , approximately twice as many whites as blacks are poor in most statistical series . Thus , the last three sentences provide additional evidence of the confusion that results when ambiguous terms are not carefully clarified . Example C Answer First let 's summarize the analysis : Efficient government can not simply be obtained by administrators who try to keep down costs . There must be comparisons of the benefits gained from the expenditure of money across government bureaus . What is ambiguous in this idea ? The word efficiency is not too clear . Suppose we say that efficiency is obtained if given levels of output are produced at least cost . In the case of government , this notion breaks down since the output of government is not easily defined . Thus , we can never ascertain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of output since we never know what the level of output is . An additional area of ambiguity that pervades discussions of efficiency is the definition of relevant outputs . Different economists will disagree about the desirability of particular outputs . Consequently , they will disagree about how efficiency should be measured when making a judgment about the efficiency of particular policies . For the concept of efficiency to make sense , you must first be sure that costs and outputs are well defined . Then you will want to ask from what point of view the policy is efficient . Is it a least-cost solution for given output levels for this bureau ? For the government ? For the society ? Just because a project is efficient at one level does not necessarily imply that it is efficient at all levels . Unless the economist tells you more about what he means about efficiency , you are not yet ready to agree or disagree with his argument . Instead , a dialogue should begin by your asking : Could you clarify the sense in which you are using efficiency ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Two Forms of Analysis ? The Usefulness of Positive and Normative Statements ? Interactions between Normative and Positive Analysis ? Practice Exercises ? Your Turn to Practice ? Suggested Answers Who is this economist who is attempting to advise you ? What is his purpose ? How does he approach economic questions ? Traditionally , economic analysis is divided into normative and positive types . The purpose of this chapte is to enable you to distinguish between the two . Why should you be able to tell whether economic analysis is normative or positive ? Because you will want to be especially alert to the values embodied in normative analysis . If they differ from // your own , you will want to resist the analysis . Thus , distinguishing between positive and normative economic analysis provides you with one basis for intelligently reacting to economic analysis . Try to complete the following exercise before reading this chapter , then return to it after completing the chapter . This experience should demonstrate that you have acquired an important skill as a result of your study of Chapter 4 . Decide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have read the chapter you may well decide that it is both positive and normative in a certain sense . To impose a minimum wage increase on an economy already experiencing 8 percent unemployment is to accelerate the dangerous rate of youth unemployment . Over the last four decades , each increase in the minimum wage has been followed by an increase in youth unemployment . Were young labor force entrants who remain unemployed able to produce enough to justify their employment at the current wage , they would have good jobs . Increasing the minimum wage serves only to make the wage rate rise beyond the productivity of even more young people in the labor force . This chapter has three sections . The first helps you distinguish between normative and positive analysis ; the usefulness of this distinction is then discussed . Several strengths and weaknesses associated with normative and positive models are also discussed . We then show that normative analysis frequently rests on positive models and that a careful distinction between the analytical forms can not always be made . DISTINGUISHING BETWEEN THE TWO FORMS OF @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a prescription . When I describe the world , I am asserting that certain facts exist now . I am telling you that from my point of view the world is in a particular form . Alternatively , if I prescribe certain behavior , I am indicating what is desirable . My purpose would be to suggest that certain behavior or attitudes should exist . Let 's apply the distinction to the following situation : Imagine two politicians discussing the extent to which fiscal policy and moneIS // tary policy have conflicting impacts on the economy . In the course of the conversation , one of them mentions that ( 1 ) a basic reason for the conflict is the relative independence of the Federal Reserve System . He explains that the Governors of the Federal Reserve Board do not run for office and are , thus , insulated from the people . Thus , the Federal Reserve Board is free to pursue policies that the public does not want and that Congress can not oversee . The other politician concurs . She suggests that they co-sponsor legislation that ( 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the voters . Examine ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) carefully . Decide whether each statement is descriptive or prescriptive . Provide a rationale for your choice in the following space . The first statement indicates one politician 's claim that the Federal Reserve System is more independent than elected officials . He felt that Federal Reserve officials are not as dependent on public opinion as are those who make fiscal policy . He is making a descriptive statement . Economists call descriptive statements positive . An economist engaged in positive analysis is producing assertions about the way he or she believes the economy is . For example , the following are all positive in nature : 1 . The level of total spending in the economy is affected by numerous individual investment decisions . 2 . Inflation is lower in countries that practice free trade and reject protectionist pressure . 3 . Gross national product is causally related to the quality of the labor force . All three statements are attempts to specify facts , rather than preferences . The second statement ( that the Federal Reserve Board @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the positive // statement of the first politician . To propose legislation requiring the Board to be elected is to indicate how she thinks the Federal Reserve Board should be chosen . Consequently , the second statement is prescriptive . Economists refer to prescriptive statements as normative . Normative analysis by an economist is an attempt to persuade others about the way the economy should be . Compare the three normative statements that follow with the three descriptive ( positive ) statements in the previous paragraph : 1 . A desirable tax cut is one that reduces inequality . 2 . If we would now adopt a gold standard , international finances would work better . 3 . We should expand public subsidies to vocational schools as a stimulus to the growth of gross national product . Each of these three statements is an opinion about what economic policy should be . The importance to you of discovering whether economic analysis is positive or normative is that you will then know how to respond actively to the economic advice . If you are to establish a dialogue with an economist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of view is . Certain responses on your part will be appropriate or inappropriate depending on the economist 's purpose . When the economic analysis is positive , it makes little sense for you to prepare elegant arguments about why the conclusion should be different in a fair or optimal economy . The economist may not disagree with you . His or her primary point is that the economy seems to be a particular way . Similarly , it would be inappropriate to attack normative economic analysis by claiming that the economist 's conclusion fails to describe the economy accurately . In such an instance , the economist 's purpose is to persuade you that a particular vision of the economy is desirable , not that it is a correct portrayal of the actual economy . To help you distinguish between the two forms of analysis , think about the art of economic modeling . Economic models focus on choice . Model-building involves creation of a logical picture of how certain choices are made . In forming such a picture , the economist needs to know who the eventual chooser will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making the choice , and what options are available to the chooser . Finally , the economist must make asIS // sumptions about the environment in which the choice will be made , and must therefore select a model representation of the world in which the choice occurs . Will the chooser have any legal constraints on his or her behavior ? What tradeoffs will need to be confronted in order to make a choice ? Are markets available for making the eventual choice ? Are there factors present that may make the market less efficient than it could be ? And so on . As economists answer these questions , they too are making certain decisions . How do the economists answer these questions as they fashion the model ? The obvious answer would be that they rely on " truth . " However , such an answer is not really helpful as long as economists lack a consistent view of exactly what truth entails . Economists form models for certain purposes . Thus , an economist might want to choose the model that in his or her opinion most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he might prefer a model that predicts the outcomes of the choice process or one that suggests the desirability of particular choices . In any case , the analyst has a choice of how to model the problem being discussed . Even within a positive framework , two economists modeling the same phenomenon might propose two radically different models . The difference between the models arises not because of a positive/ normative choice but because of different underlying values . Since different policy prescriptions flow from each model , the policies used surely will be conflicting . Those initial choices are the force driving the eventual normative conclusions . Thus , when evaluating a particular model , you should be attentive to the identity of the chooser , what is being chosen , and the economic environment in which the choice is being made . As an illustration , suppose an economist employed by XYZ oil firm is asked about the impacts of oil allocation rules , which requires that all refiners have the same access to domestic ( U.S.-produced ) crude oil as they had in 1973 . Would you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reflect the views of his or her employer ? In such a case , the economist would probably select as a criterion or objective the impact of the allocation rules on firm XYZ 's profits . Thus , refiners that do not have their own domestic source of crude oil might favorably view the allocation rules . Yet , other firms with domestic supplies , that are forced to provide crude oil to firms without domestic supplies , might consider themselves worse off . // Further , an economist not associated with the oil industry might select a different criterion . For example , the individual might wonder whether the structure of the industry had been changed by such rules . She or he would want to know whether the industry is more competitive after the choice than before . Thus , the choice of criterion for a model depends on the values of the economist constructing it and the purpose that the economist has for the model . What does all of this have to do with positive and normative models ? The answer is that one aspect of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the model 's author intended the model primarily as a descriptive device or a prescriptive device . By examining who the modeler is and the model he or she has chosen , you may be able to discover this element of the author 's intent . What clue could you use to distinguish positive from normative models ? Economists frequently argue that positive models are models that are value free , and that the author of the model did not impose personal values on the model . Upon closer inspection , most people would reject this line of argument . Surely the modeler is a chooser . Why did the economic analyst choose one assumption and not another ? The person 's values surely dictated the choice . It may be more correct to argue that a positive model is one that can be tested ; one for which data can be gathered such that the model can be rejected or falsified by the data . Normative models are models that explicitly depend on certain values of the modeler . But more important , the model attempts to set out what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can only be described in a model since it does not exist . Such a model is not susceptible to being tested or falsified ; data can not be collected to show that the assumptions of the normative model yield false predictions . Consequently , you can identify positive models by asking yourself whether you could design a test that would demonstrate the accuracy of the conclusion . Perhaps the best clue for identifying a normative model is by asking yourself whether the model is urging you to accept a particular vision of the way the economy should be . If you are hearing how things should be , then you are hearing a normative argument . Words like should or ought appear frequently in normative analysis . If the argument attempts to describe a situation as it seems to be , then that argument is positive . Further // evidence of a positive model would be if the author uses the model to predict some behavior and then tests to see if the prediction has come true or in some way , perhaps statistically , tested the model . Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 . The facts are that the future of energy is with solar energy . We can not decide now to turn off government projects that develop solar energy systems without long-run harm to the economy in the form of very high energy costs . 2 . The future belongs with coal . Ever since Three Mile Island , it is clear that nuclear is unsafe . Such accidents , plus the problems of waste disposal , mean we must give up the nuclear dream before it turns ? to nightmare and turn instead to our most abundant fuel . The first example is positive analysis since it provides a testable statement . In statement number 1 , we would see in time whether or not the lack of government support for development of solar energy systems would cause harm . Note there is some ambiguity since " harm " is not well defined . Statement number 2 is normative . There is no testable hypothesis there . One final hint that might help you determine the extent to which a particular model is positive or normative is to reread the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yourself : Is that paragraph primarily positive or normative ? Using this technique , you are essentially dividing the analysis into its component parts . When you have completed that process , you can then make some overall judgment about the type of economic analysis you have been evaluating . THE USEFULNESS OF POSITIVE AND NORMATIVE STATEMENTS Positive and normative models each have their special benefits as well as weaknesses . By recognizing the relative usefulness of each , you can better evaluate whatever economic advice you are receiving . The main strength of a positive statement is that , at minimum , it helps us understand something about some economic event or policy . In fact , some predictions may help us assess the direction in which // the world may be going . A major inadequacy of a positive model is that it may indicate the direction in which the world is going , but it does not tell us whether such a direction is desirable . Normative models have strengths and weaknesses also . Their main strength is that such models provide a framework for judging whether or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stated somewhat differently , from normative models we obtain a framework that allows us to judge whether or not we are where the values of the model-maker would like us to be . An important inadequacy in normative models is that indeed the model is based on someone 's values and those values may not be anything like yours . Further , a normative model may dictate choices that can not realistically be made . For example , it is frequently argued that in the case of air pollution , polluters should be forced to pay for cleaning up the air to meet acceptable standards . The mechanism for requiring such payments may require a bureaucracy that is more expensive than the harm it is organized to combat . Such a choice may be highly improbable and yet it is the choice that a normative model might contend should be made . Another problem with the implementation of normative models is that they may ignore political or other realities . Suppose , for example , that influential economists agreed that at a particular moment an increase in taxes was necessary but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What congressman would sponsor such legislation ? Yet that action is what the normative model says should be done ! INTERACTIONS BETWEEN NORMATIVE AND POSITIVE ANALYSIS The distinction between positive and normative economics is very important , but it should not be exaggerated . The two types of analysis are different , but the differences between them are not as sharp as it may appear at first glance . Consequently , you should resist ( 1 ) the temptation to relax and simply accept positive statements , as well as ( 2 ) the tendency to consider normative statements as reflective of mere opinion . Both positive and normative economics should be approached with caution , as the last section suggested . In // either case , you should evaluate the economic analysis the author offers . Normative statements are frequently based on positive models . For example , in macro-economics , an economist who embraces the Keynesian model essentially embraces a positive model as well . The Keynesian model is one that is surely capable of being falsified ; many would argue that it has been falsified ! But the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Keynes has not been falsified ) would use the model in a normative sense as well as a positive sense . Let us investigate this interaction between the two types of models even further . Suppose that an economist has proposed a model of economic behavior and that the model could be tested . At this point , the model is a positive model . Suppose that the model is tested and the economist , using rules of statistical testing , accepts ( does not reject ) the model . Then the economist will want to use the model for policy purposes . At that point , his or her advice takes a normative turn . The economist might start saying things like , " Given current conditions and if the Federal Reserve does not change its policy , then the government should balance the budget in the next fiscal year . " The point is that such a normative statement is based on a positive model . The reason for the prescription of the balanced budget is that this economist has assumed some objective for the economy to reach and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ normative conclusion results . Given a different set of objectives and the same positive model , a different prescription or policy suggestion is likely . Thus , it may be true that normative statements are based on positive models . In such a case , if the positive model were falsified , then the resulting normative implications derived from that model would also fail . As readers and listeners , you must be careful to understand when a normative model is partially based on positive analysis . Both normative and positive analysis would ideally begin by the economist 's listing his or her values , goals , and general intent . If an economist is that explicit , then the reader is forewarned . The economist is trying to sell a particular view of the world , and the reader knows it . However , the normative analysis of an economist may have great persuasive impact simply because it is assumed that the economist 's insights have been informed by professional training . A normally cautious reader may be less sensitive to weaknesses in the // economist 's reasoning in such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the normative reasoning of an economist with the same healthy skepticism used to evaluate anyone else 's claims . Economists do not have special ethical powers that would enable them to prescribe for the rest of us . Unfortunately , much normative economic analysis does not proceed from a set of explicit prescriptive statements . Instead , the normative element of the economist 's advice is foisted off on the reader with the ethical preconceptions concealed . A major task for most readers who want to understand economic analysis is uncovering the basis for the normative reasoning . When they encounter economic analysis that is normative , they must repeatedly inquire , " Why is this particular conclusion any more desirable than any other ? " A major danger of normative economic analysis is that this question will go unasked and , therefore , unanswered . The consumer of economic expertise will then accept conclusions that are inconsistent with her or his own value priorities . An economist who engages in normative analysis is necessarily shaping conclusions on the basis of a set of views about the nature of the existing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that what is , is undesirable . Otherwise , what is the need for a new economic policy ? Consequently , normative economics is dependent on positive economic analysis . The normative economist is able to criticize the existing economic relationship only because he or she has assumed that particular forms of positive analysis are the most reliable . Why should you be wary of economic analysis that is positive in nature ? Positive analysis is often a disguised form of normative analysis . The values and preconceived beliefs of the economist are often molding the selection and organization of factual statements . Positive analysis is sometimes more persuasive than it should be because the judgmental element of the economist 's reasoning is relatively hidden . To recognize the hidden normative element , you may have to be aware of different facts that would have been equally pertinent but were omitted because they did not fit with what the economist wanted to say . Facts do not exist in a vacuum . As soon as a particular group of facts is chosen and then marshalled in a particular fashion , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Any careful reader or listener will want to ask : But is that conclusion // somehow stronger than others that could be reached through an equally rational process ? If not , why was it chosen in place of the options ? PRACTICE EXERCISES Identify the interactions between positive and normative models in each of the following sample passages . Exercise A The economic growth rate of Paraguay has slowed over the last decade . One of the factors responsible for this problem is the decline in private savings . Apparently , the people of Paraguay have chosen to accelerate consumption at the expense of lower savings rates and a resulting paucity of investment . A given economy has only a limited supply of resources . The more the citizens consume , the less resources will be available for capital goods production . The economy of Paraguay is relatively slow growing because of the conscious choice to consume at a high rate now . Exercise B On the fifth of December , Governor DeKalb will sign a bill compelling firms that deposit toxic wastes in the ground to pay for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This legislation is confused . Firms would simply charge their customers for any additional clean-up costs they are required to pay by the new legislation . The alternative method of paying for decontaminating polluted areas would be higher taxes . I do n't see the point of the Governor 's bill . Any way you look at the problem , the same people will have to pay ? US ! // Exercise C We are dealing here with a firm that has persistently spent extensive amounts of funds on research and development . The purpose of such expenditures should be to benefit consumers . However , for this benefit to be realized , these expenditures must be both productive and efficient . If consumers gain from these expenditures in terms of either lower cost or more satisfying products , then perhaps we would applaud this firm 's efforts . Let 's take a look at the record of this firm 's behavior to see whether the desired benefit has been achieved . ( If it has not , then the firm should be " encouraged " via litigation to perform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that this firm has spent an average of $4 million per year for the last decade on research and development in its sausage division alone . Yet , there has not been one single technological advance or meaningful product innovation during that entire period . The former director of research and development for the sausage division assures us that his staff discovered techniques for reducing the fat content in sausage , while maintaining the current taste and texture of sausage . Yet , to his dismay , his firm refused to put his staff 's discovery into practice . // YOUR TURN TO PRACTICE Exercise D The primary victims of inflation are the poor . Firms are hesitant to expand production when price fluctuations disturb their ability to plan expected profits . Thus , the number of jobs available to the poor are limited by the stagnating impact of inflation . In addition , our research demonstrates that during inflation the price mark-up is higher in areas where the poor predominantly shop . Perhaps those who sell to the poor recognize that paying for transportation to other potential markets is especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Therefore , they exploit their captive audience a little more by marking up their merchandise above what it would be if the poor were more mobile . SUGGESTED ANSWERS Exercise A Answer This sample exercise is the best illustration of positive analysis among the three sample exercises . The author is not suggesting that Paraguay should have greater economic growth , or that it should reduce its consumption spending . He is simply explaining a cause of reduced growth . Within the author 's model of how an economy grows , is the presumption that private savings are a primary vehicle for expanding investment . There is a possible normative element to this reasoning ; another source of investment funds is being ignored possibly because it conflicts with the author 's view as to how an economy should grow . If government stimulates economic growth through direct investment of tax monies , the role played by the market as an allocator is // reduced . The focus on personal savings rates may tell us that the author prefers growth when it is stimulated by private capital spending . Exercise B Answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this analysis , this individual may be encouraging us to urge the governor not to sign the prospective legislation . If that is the author 's purpose , then the analysis is normative . This exercise seems to say that the legislation is unnecessary , given current financing mechanisms for cleaning up the environment . In this analysis the positive model used by the author is especially important . In pure competition it is true that any clean-up cost imposed on the firm would be passed on to the consumers . However , there is no way of predicting in advance how a firm will react to a new cost in a noncompetitive market . Some , all , or none of the costs could be passed on to consumers , depending on the extent of market power possessed by the firm . Notice how the action the author wants us to take makes more sense if we accept the particular positive model that was used . However , the author did not tell us about the linkage between the two models ; we had to find the relationship ourselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this passage starts by telling us what should be , and , based on those objectives , the author wants us to take action . The individual is disturbed about the alleged inefficiency and lack of innovation present in the firm being examined . The author is prescribing certain behavior and says that we , too , should support laws that would compel product innovation from this firm . Evidence from the sausage division of the firm is designed to heighten our interest in joining the author 's stance . The analysis is primarily normative as a result . Can we recognize from this analysis any implicit positive model that should be made explicit prior to deciding whether we support the author 's efforts ? First , we are told that the objective of concern is consumer welfare . That recognition is important because it tells us who the author wants to aid . Apparently , the author sees govIS // ernmental action as a workable technique for stimulating the results he or she prefers . When economic performance of a firm is undesirable , the author does not wait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long run . Instead , collective action to correct the imperfection is advocated . 5 What Economic Paradigm Is Shaping the Analysis ? ? Conservative , Liberal , and Democratic Socialist Para-digms ? Clues for Identifying Economic Paradigms ? Conservative Paradigm ? Liberal Paradigm ? Democratic Socialist Paradigm ? Illustrative Divergent Reactions to an Economic Question ? Practice Exercises ? Your Turn to Practice ? Suggested Answers 56 WHAT ECONOMIC PARADIGM IS SHAPING THE ANALYSIS ? Economists agree about many aspects of economic behavior . For example , that a demand curve is generally down-sloping to the right is not a source of disagreement among economists . The disagreements you have heard so much about ? for instance , the conflict over the optimal solution to inflation or the correct response to business concentration ? are caused fundamentally by what we will call alternative economic paradigms ( pronounced pair-a-dimes ) . These paradigms represent a set of implicit assumptions , perspectives , attitudes , and objectives typically shared by advocates of a particular paradigm . Each paradigm has its own language , favorite questions , and preferred solutions . As simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provides a mechanism for organizing economic data and issues into a coherent framework . The purpose of this chapter is not to persuade you that any particular paradigm is correct . Each paradigm has its strengths and weaknesses as you might expect . At the conclusion of your study of this chapter you should be able to read economic advice like the following and determine the economist 's paradigm . Does the following quote reflect a conservative , liberal , or democratic socialist paradigm ? The one catch in all the plans for a windfall profits tax is the oil companies ' power over the political and economic system . They have again and again used OPEC price increases to their own advantage . There is a good chance that , even if a windfall profits tax is passed , they can avoid much of the tax liability or make sure most of the tax they can not avoid comes back to them as grants or credits for synthetic fuel development . If you feel that you can spot the paradigm , make a mental note of it , read the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what you read . If you do not know where to start in identifying the paradigm , relax and read the chapter . You will be surprised how quickly you will acquire this skill . Why should you want to be able to identify an analyst 's paradigm ? The answer : So you can understand the basis for his or her reasoning . An economist 's paradigm is usually " under the surface " of his or her analysis . Economists themselves may not consciously be adjusting their analysis to fit a paradigmatic pattern . Yet , if you are to understand and evaluate the quality of the analysis , it is especially helpful to be able to recognize the hidden component that is shaping their work . // Many economists will understandably resist the idea that their work can be classified into one of three categories ? conservative , liberal , or democratic socialist . No single economist will fit perfectly into such a simple classification scheme . One 's analysis may reflect elements of more than one paradigm . However , as an organizational aid to understanding economic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and preliminary step toward the level of comprehension required for evaluation . Certainly there is no implied criticism associated with categorizing economic analysis into a paradigm . Labelling economic analysis " conservative , " " liberal , " or " democratic socialist " is not a substitute for thought ; it is a facilitator . After you develop some facility with the material in this chapter , you should resist any temptation to assume that once you have identified an economist 's paradigm , the identification by itself prepares you adequately for reacting to her or his conclusion . Identification of the economic paradigm is a technique for discovering what the economist is actually saying . It helps identify the question being asked , the probable criteria that the economist will use to test a model , and the reason why certain tradeoffs are preferred by the economist . Identification of an economist 's paradigm should not be used as an assessment device , permitting you to dispense with a more complete appreciation of his or her analysis . This chapter discusses three economic paradigms . The first section provides an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discovering which paradigm is being assumed are then suggested . The next three sections define each paradigm in terms of the clues . An illustration then follows on how a representative of each paradigm might react to a particular economic question . As is typical , the chapter concludes with practice exercises . CONSERVATIVE , LIBERAL , AND DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST PARADIGMS The three major paradigms that American economic analysis reflects are conservative , liberal , and democratic socialist . Certainly in terms of numerical importance the first two dwarf democratic socialism in significance . Each paradigm has its own internal debates so you should not expect every member of one of the paradigms to accept 58 WHAT ECONOMIC PARADIGM IS SHAPING THE ANALYSIS ? the total description of his or her paradigm that we will provide you . In fact , much of the intellectual energy of an economist is spent refining points of controversy within one 's preferred paradigm , rather than engaging in the broader debate among paradigms . We must warn you in advance that our descriptions of the paradigms will not be totally satisfactory since they will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with are fair ( hopefully ) and brief capsule portraits of each paradigm . You can use these descriptions both to identify the paradigms of economists and as a starting point for a more detailed study of any of the paradigms that especially interest you . You will notice that whenever reference to a socialist paradigm occurs in Understanding Economic Analysis , it is prefaced by the word democratic . The reason is that we want to equip you for understanding American economic analysis . To fit into one of the three paradigms in the American context does not imply that the same categorization would be meaningful in a broader context , e.g. , Western economic thought . Consequently , a discussion of totalitarian versions of socialism is excluded from this chapter . The democratic traditions of our country , as well as the observable absence of economists in this country who represent totalitarian socialism , explain our focus on democratic socialism , rather than on the better-known totalitarian forms . American economists often classify their analysis with much more narrow categories than we are using . For example , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monetarist , structuralist , rational expectations , or human capital school of thought . Each of these categories is useful , but they are all more restrictive than the concept of paradigms discussed in this chapter . The three paradigms you will become familiar with are broad enough that they will be helpful in understanding economic analysis on any topic . They are efficient clues to understanding . Had we chosen a more narrow concept of paradigms , you would be required to learn several labels for each specialty within economics . If you study economics in greater detail , you will want to learn these more narrow paradigms as you intensely study a particular field within economics . For your current purposes , though , the more general the paradigm , the better ? so long as it does not become so general that it loses any usefulness as an analytical tool . Both conservatism and liberalism are capitalistic paradigms. // Capitalism refers to an economic system that relies on markets as the basic mechanism for resolving the inevitable conflicts caused by scarcity . Every economy must answer certain questions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produced , how to produce that amount , and who will get what is produced . A market system is one mechanism for resolving such questions . Conservatives and liberals share a devotion to markets as the best conflict resolution system . They both tend to prefer market solutions to economic problems and to support governmental solutions as a last resort only after market failure has been substantiated . A basic idea of capitalism is the belief that social welfare is advanced by encouraging each individual to pursue his or her own self-interest . Individual choice or selfishness plays a critical role in capitalist thought . It is the device by which the public interest is discovered and attained . A major strength of capitalism is that it takes the individual 's natural focus on oneself and suggests that this focus provides results that will be socially desirable . Conservatives and liberals share devotion to the collective public virtue of individual selfishness . This characterization of individual greed as so-cially useful is one of the fundamental objections socialists have to capitalism and to the profit motive that directs its activities . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves , we want to provide you with a set of clues that will enable you to discover an economist 's paradigm with minimal difficulty . There are several basic questions about which economists in the three paradigms typically disagree . Your awareness of the importance of these questions as distinguishing features of the paradigms will give you a set of criteria that can be used to identify an economist 's paradigm . Use the questions as a type of checklist . We have intentionally made the list as brief as possible because we want you to have a few , powerful aids , rather than an extensive list that would be bulky and difficult to remember . Clue 1 : What Role Do Markets Play in the Economist 's Proposed Solution ? Markets can play numerous roles in answering economic questions . They may be used to allocate scarce resources among competing uses , to determine the distribution of income , to regulate 60 WHAT ECONOMIC PARADIGM IS SHAPING THE ANALYSIS ? private selfishness , and to distribute goods and services . Proponents of each paradigm tend to disagree about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The following criticism of incomes policies illustrates the kind of analysis that will be made by proponents of market decisionmaking . As any other advocate , they tend to presume an idealized version of the perspective they want the reader to adopt . Strict compliance with any incomes policy , either controls or guidelines , disrupts the rationing function of an unregulated price system . The well-intentioned distortion of relative prices prevents price adjustments to evolving market conditions and , thus , interferes with the optimal allocation of resources . The public decisions about prices should be reflected through the interaction of demand and supply . The market orientation of the quote does not enable you to pin down the author 's paradigm , but you can be certain that a democratic socialist would not be so quick to rush to the defense of market decision-making . Clue 2 : What Role Does Government or the Political Process Play in the Economist 's Proposed Solution ? Governments have several possible economic functions . They can ( 1 ) allocate resources ; ( 2 ) alter the market distribution of income @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and product quality ; and ( 4 ) stabilize employment and price fluctuations . If you envision a spectrum with one endpoint representing complete reliance on markets to answer economic questions and the other endpoint representing total reliance on government , the more an economy moves toward the latter endpoint the more socialist the economy becomes . Table No economy is located at either of the extremes on this spectrum . Every economy is mixed in the sense that each has some form of market system and each has a government . Economies and economists disagree about the nature of the optimal mix . You can use your awareness of this disagreement as a clue for identifying an economist 's paradigm . As you study the next illustration , notice how different in emWHAT // phasis it is from a market-oriented approach to maintaining a high degree of competitive activity in our economy . There is presently an abundance of regulatory agencies , created over the years in an attempt to maintain and promote competition and to regulate economic behavior " in the public interest . " These agencies are justified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the richest and most productive in the world , while helping avoid some of the more severe political answers that have plagued other nations . Without regulation , our only other alternative would be a massive takeover of major industries by government . Our primary task is to make sure we promote a fair and equitable regulation that affords the greatest amount of freedom possible . As with the first clue , this one will not enable you to definitely establish the author 's paradigm . However , you should have a strong hunch after reading the illustration that the author is not a conservative . Most conservatives would not look with favor on the author 's claim that regulatory agencies have played an essential role in this nation 's economic accomplishments . Clue 3 : To What Extent Is the Distribution of Property and Wealth a Reflection of Individual Choice ? Environmental Factors ? Blame and credit are concepts that make sense only in a context of meaningful individual choice . It makes little sense to blame a victim of a hurricane for being in its path . It might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warning about the dangers of staying in the hurricane 's path , refused to leave and consequently was seriously injured by the hurricane 's destruction . In the first instance , blame makes no sense because individuals do not control the path of a hurricane . In the latter example , the injured individual could have improved his or her condition and chose not to . The same type of reasoning shapes an economist 's assumption about the distribution of property . To the extent that I see these rights as resulting from individual choices about how hard to work , how long to go to school , where to live , what occupation to choose , and how much time to devote to leisure , the more I will defend the distribution of market income that exists . If I accept this type of reasoning , I would argue that when individuals wish to alter their status , let them do so by making better choices . Such a view would lead an economist to see both wealth and poverty as the product of a complex individual choice process , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IS SHAPING THE ANALYSIS ? be altered by those who think they know more about what individuals want than do the individuals themselves . The opposite extreme , with respect to the cause of this distribution of income and property , would be the belief that each person 's share is determined primarily by factors over which the individual has only minor control . Factors such as sex , race , family background , historical era , nationality , and luck are environmental , and not susceptible to alteration by individual choice . If an economist sees these factors as the most powerful explanation of income and property distribution , he or she will probably wish to modify the market distribution of income and wealth in the direction of greater equality . The market distribution loses its moral force if it is determined by factors beyond the individual 's control . A more complete discussion of the impact of income distribution on economic analysis appears in Chapter 10 . No economist would argue totally for either of these two polar descriptions of how wealth and income are determined . However , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ description . That emphasis provides another clue to identifying an economist 's paradigm . The reactions of the three primary economic paradigms to this issue will be discussed in the next three sections . For instance , notice the emphasis on factors beyond the individual 's control in the following economic analysis : Millions of people are trapped in a cycle of poverty that has no beginning and no end . Inadequate income causes poverty , which in turn creates cultural obstacles to motivation , which results in poor health and insufficient education , which causes reduced income and so on . Poverty is consequently passed from one generation to the next . Clue 4 : How Extensive Are Externalities and Economic Profits in the Economy ? This clue is closely related to the first two . It provides a more specific hint regarding the economist 's attitude toward the relative roles of markets and governments . The greater the magnitude of externalities or economic profits in the economy , the more desirable it is to have an active government altering relative prices , rules , or the distribution of economic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of government and the extent of externalities or economic profits is that markets may have no internal mechanism for altering the extent of either externalities or excess // economic profits . If externalities or economic profits are viewed by an economist as significant problems , she or he is pushed toward advocacy of a larger role for government . Chapter 9 focuses on the problem of externalities and their impact on allocation . Thus , Clue 4 can be used as a more subtle way of discovering the nature of Clues 1 and 2 when the economist is not explicit about views regarding the relative roles of markets and government . For instance , the attitude of the economic analyst who wrote the next illustration would probably be inconsistent with an expanded role for government in adjusting prices and product quality : Profits can , in certain instances , be socially wasteful . In such instances the profits result from the existence of monopolies or pricefixing conspiracies . Most profits are not earned in such a manner . Instead , they are both essential and desirable to our economic welfare . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by adjusting their behavior to meet consumer expectations . Each of the paradigms will be explained in terms of the four clues . In addition , numerous illustrations will be provided to serve as models that you can use to compare with the analysis of an economist whose paradigm you are trying to identify . CONSERVATIVE PARADIGM Conservatives have a distinct preference for market solutions to allocation , distribution , and regulatory and stabilization problems . Conservatives share a general contempt for the possibilities of collective action . When government acts , there are necessarily large groups of people who will be displeased with the governmental choice . Thus , to a conservative , governmental choice is typically coercive , undesirable , and destructive of individual freedom . Conservatives are consequently highly sensitive to the misuse of governmental power . Using the four clues , let 's take a more precise look at conservatism . In markets , individuals decide which products or services to purchase as well as which firms to use as a source of supply . When conservatives refer to the superiority of market decisions , they typically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ characteristics of an ideal or optimal market . The income distribution is 64 WHAT ECONOMIC PARADIGM IS SHAPING THE ANALYSIS ? assumed to be basically fair , externalities few , product information abundant , and the market structure competitive . This version of prevailing markets is then contrasted to the coercive and bulky government . Markets are not seen as perfect by conservatives . However , they do tend to see them as approaching relative perfection in the sense that they are superior to governmental approaches . Conservatives are not rigid in their opposition to an active governmental role in the economy . Conservative economists may be vigorous supporters of greater governmental expenditures for defense , police , fire protection , prison construction , or judicial purposes . Why the switch in position ? Notice that each of the governmental expenditures traditionally supported by conservatives preserves the existing distribution of resources and rights . Such support makes a lot of sense once you remember that conservatives tend to support the existing distribution for what are very good reasons within the perspective enveloped by their paradigm . Other types of governmental expenditures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expansion of public employment programs , or national health insurance strike conservatives as being a heavy-handed interference with a market distribution of resources , which reflects the individual judgment of each and every consumer . Understandably , they are vociferous in denouncing such expenditures as wasteful , unnecessary , and unfair . One element of modern controversy within the conservative paradigm is the desirability of governmental aid to firms who are going broke . Traditionally , conservatives have seen business losses as a signal that consumers are rejecting what the firm has to offer . While it is certainly sad to the businessperson who loses money , the loss may be socially beneficial because it reflects consumer votes concerning the desirability of a new allocation of resources . Now , however , the conservative paradigm is split on this issue . How could a conservative justify using tax money to subsidize firms that have failed the market test ? Several rationales are available to explain how some conservatives can support governmental aid to failing firms . First , a conservative might argue that foreign competition , technological changes , or some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firm 's problems . Thus , the firm is an innocent victim of an economic process for which it is not responsible . Second , the firm 's historical success provides evidence // that it once pleased consumers ; a subsidy from the government would be a reward for past contributions . A third possible rationale would be the detrimental impact on employment levels and public morale when a major firm fails . Using this third rationale , a conservative might suggest that a governmental subsidy to a failing firm would be the best choice between two evils . That conservatives have a strong bias toward market solutions to economic problems is a proper generalization from which to begin your search for an economist 's paradigm . However , their view that market results are preferable to political decisions may be modified when the governmental policies reinforce the existing economic structure of income and wealth distribution . What is it about the market distribution of income that is so attractive to conservatives ? Incomes are derived from production . Successful production is possible only if the income earner pleases consumers by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work is inconsistent with the allocation of resources preferred by consumers , the income earner will earn little income . As a result , the individual is rewarded in relation to his or her contribution to social welfare . Principles of fairness and efficiency support the legitimacy of the resulting distribution . The wealthy person made occupational and educational choices that merit reward . Those without substantial income and assets would have worked harder , thought more carefully , and made a different choice between work and leisure had they wanted more money . Such beliefs about the basis for the existing distribution create support for its preservation . The conservative perspective with respect to the extent of externalities and market power can be inferred from their treatment of the proper economic roles of markets and governments . Conservatives tend to minimize the importance of externalities and market power . Externalities certainly exist in a conservative 's view of the world , but their significance as a distortion of efficient allocation only rarely justifies public actions that would alter relative prices . The imposition of taxes , regulations , or subsidies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ price that will be paid in the form of greater governmental bureaucracy and the interference with consumer choice . Similarly , market power is viewed as too insignificant to justify public regulation of industrial structure or performance . Markets are assumed to be essentially competitive . When monopoly elements 66 WHAT ECONOMIC PARADIGM IS SHAPING THE ANALYSIS ? are observed in a particular market , conservatives usually explain them as the result of governmental actions . Governmental licensing , regulation , and tariffs are the sources of market power for a conservative . Hence , the elimination of whatever market power exists requires a restricted , rather than an expanded , role for government in the economy . LIBERAL PARADIGM The liberal paradigm is much less clearly defined than the other two . Liberals share with conservatives the general view that markets are a preferable means of answering economic questions . Yet liberals are much quicker to see market failures and to advocate governmental reform as a remedy . Liberals share with socialists a belief that government possesses the potential to more accurately reflect the allocational and distributional preferences of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government as a remedial device correcting occasional flaws in market decisions , while socialists see the market as inherently flawed . Probably the safest way in which to view the liberal paradigm is to see it as an intermediate position fluctuating at various times between the two more coherent extremes of conservatism and socialism . Liberals may appear to the other two paradigms as lacking in principle . However , in their defense , liberals would point out the necessity of striking political compromises in an economy populated by numerous divergent groups . While accepting the general proposition in the abstract that markets are superior decision-making processes when compared to governmental decisions , liberals perceive and respond to an extensive list of market failures . The solution they propose are all designed to improve markets , not eliminate them . Liberals accept the capitalistic belief that the profit motive should be the primary motive stimulating producers to expand or contract production . Governmental reforms supported by liberals have as their purpose the redirection of the profit motive , not its replacement . Consumer protection programs , wage-price guidelines , and antitrust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as governmental adjustments to market decisions . These adjustments will strengthen // the market system by modifying markets in such a way that they will approximate the perfect markets that conservatives assume already exist . Governmental policies are not an end in themselves ; they offer a means by which markets can be improved . Since they are highly sensitive to market failures , it should be expected that liberals would scrutinize the existing income and wealth distribution very closely . To applaud market decisions requires a certain devotion to the existing distribution . Liberals are not satisfied with the existing distribution because they recognize that certain groups have overwhelming disadvantages . These disadvantages may not be reversible without the aid of an active government . Tax and subsidy programs are advocated by liberals as a means for establishing a more equitable income distribution . Maldistribution of income is seen as just one of several factors that would cause market signals to be distorted . Liberal energies are often dedicated more to improving market information or alleviating externalities than they are to redistributing income , because the former two are susceptible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that an individual essentially gets what he or she deserves , liberal efforts to alter the distribution are not likely to be overly successful . Thus , liberals may sensibly focus on market failures that are more susceptible to change . Liberals often highlight externalities and market power as two market failures that government should alter . In both instances , the objective of the reforms is to make market prices a more accurate signal of allocative efficiency and distributional equity . The number of externalities and the extent of market power are more significant to liberals than they are to conservatives . Liberals are not as protective of the existing market , but they are almost as devoted to the potential contributions that a reformed market system can make to answering the basic economic questions . DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST PARADIGM The central belief that shapes the view of the economist applying the democratic socialist paradigm is the fundamental inequity of property , income , and wealth distribution . Since socialists argue that distribution is largely shaped by environmental factors that are 68 WHAT ECONOMIC PARADIGM IS SHAPING THE ANALYSIS ? beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the ability of the profit motive to transform individual selfishness into social welfare . If demand curves are being shaped through consumer choices reflecting an unfair distribution , then the resulting prices become signals of inequity . Any resulting allocation of resources is tainted by that judgment . Both conservatives and liberals possess the goal of equal opportunity ; socialists contend that equality of condition must be approached before equality of opportunity has any real meaning . To a socialist , many of the freedoms touted by conservatives and liberals are deceptive in that wealthy people are able to take advantage of them , while poor people lack the funds necessary to transform opportunities like labor mobility , " free " education , or open housing into meaningful routes toward economic success . Many of the " opportunities " available in a capitalist economy are seen by socialists as a hoax through which the poor are pacified . Poor people possess many paper freedoms , but they lack the money required to activate them . Only if income and wealth were more equal could the political process be truly democratic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and money to affect who political candidates will be and who will eventually be elected . The vast difference among the resources of economic actors will consequently make a sham out of the idea of " one person , one vote . " It is important to notice that socialists do not suggest absolute equality . Socialists , like liberals and conservatives , agree that inequality is necessary to provide incentives for productive effort . What the paradigms disagree about is the degree of inequality that is desirable . Markets are viewed with mistrust by socialists . First , market decisions reflect the maldistribution of resources that lies at the heart of socialist dissatisfaction with capitalism . Second , markets are perceived as being inherently concentrated . As the competitive process evolves , many competitors will flounder and only a few will survive . Finally , market decisions are shaped by demand ? the desire for goods and services in combination with the ability to pay for them . Many economic actors need goods and services but lack the money required to constitute demand . Firms respond to demand and not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in what to a socialist is an irrational direction . Governments in an economy with substantive inequality are // criticized by socialists as instruments of the wealthy . Politicians and government employees respond to the pressures of those with the money to purchase influence . Thus , it is understandable that socialists do not automatically support governmental expenditures in the American economy . Many of the expenditures sponsored by liberals strike socialists as well-intentioned , but naive . The resulting governmental agencies will be captured by many of the same people the agencies are supposed to regulate . Worse still , the masses will get the impression that problems are being solved when in reality their fundamental cause ? inequality ? is being ignored . Socialists are not impressed by attempts to alleviate market failures because it is the inherent flaws in market operation that disturb socialists . Reform measures only hide the real problems . In general , socialists do support the view that governmental decisions are superior to unplanned market decisions . If the income distribution is relatively equal , governments offer the best opportunity to represent all relevant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be encouraged to behave in certain ways and discouraged from behaving in others by a government representing the public interest . Notice that socialists assume a relatively perfect conception of government much as conservatives assume relatively perfect markets . Socialists tend to overlook the factors that would distort political decisions . Government is seen as the fair voice of the community . Social justice will result when this community is able to give voice to its preferred allocation and distribution . Markets may be used to distribute goods and services in an equitable fashion , but only after the distribution of income and wealth has been made substantially equal and social control of industry has been attained . ILLUSTRATIVE DIVERGENT REACTIONS TO AN ECONOMIC QUESTION To help you acquire a working understanding of the three paradigms , we have placed in this section an example of the reactions by representatives of each paradigm to the controversy over the effect of unbalanced governmental budgets on our economy and the consequent debate over attempts to curb the growth of deficit spending . 70 WHAT ECONOMIC PARADIGM IS SHAPING THE ANALYSIS ? Conservative Like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what it brings in with what it spends . There is no need for deficit spending to stimulate our economy . Deficit spending , accompanied by extensive monetary expansion , is a major cause of inflation . Moreover , it interferes with the economy 's natural corrective mechanisms because it changes the magnitude of private investment and consumption . Government will never , on its own , limit deficit spending . There must be a Constitutional ban on deficit spending with the only exception being a national emergency . Liberal There are many instances when deficit spending is necessary and appropriate ? and unavoidable . During a recession , when tax cuts or increases in government expenditures are required to get the economy back on its feet , attempts to balance the budget will only further depress the economy . That there have been inappropriate and inflationary deficits in the past is no reason to tie government 's hands with an arbitrary rule . The solution lies in improving the workings of fiscal policy by greater consideration of the circumstances demanding action , not Constitutional limitations on Congressional discretion . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has accepted the role of correcting problems of unemployment that are created by the normal functioning of our economy . Business can not generate enough employment by itself , so deficit spending is required to supplement aggregate demand . The conflicts between groups that our economy naturally fosters are reduced temporarily by deficit spending since welfare spending postpones the inevitable clash between classes over a limited number of jobs . It hardly makes sense to blame economic problems on deficit spending since it is the economic system itself that is responsible . Footnote // PRACTICE EXERCISES Attempt to identify the paradigm represented by each of the following examples of economic analysis . Provide the rationale for each of your answers . Exercise A There is a rather odd notion becoming prevalent in the Antitrust Division of the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) . That idea is that we must punish any firm or small group of firms that wins a large share of a market by producing efficiently and providing consumers with goods they desire . This " witch hunt " by politicians only contributes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concentrated manufacturing sectors would be economic suicide . Costs would increase by approximately 20 percent and prices by 10 to 15 percent . We would be wiser to leave the determination of appropriate size to the market , rather than to some " well-meaning " but misguided federal agency.2 Exercise B Antitrust measures and government regulation serve the interests of those having the most political and economic clout ( i.e. , those in command of the large corporations ) . Monetary and fiscal policies are incapable of creating and maintaining a recession severe enough to control inflation . Consequently , wage and price controls , appro- Footnote 72 WHAT ECONOMIC PARADIGM IS SHAPING THE ANALYSIS ? priately designed and fairly enforced , are the only workable solution . However , even these controls will probably not be enforced if enacted . Exercise C There are several steps the United States must take to deal with its present energy problems . The first step is to decontrol domestic oil , natural gas , and gasoline prices . Artificially maintaining low prices encourages consumption and discourages further exploration and development of new energy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more efficient job of allocating existing supplies than can any government agency . The primary role of government should be to encourage private development of alternative energy sources through tax incentives to private firms . YOUR TURN TO PRACTICE Exercise D Attempts to limit the powers of the Federal Trade Commission will only result in placing consumers at the mercy of big business . ConWHAT // sumers need more protection , not less . Alone , they are unable to weed out unscrupulous businessmen , because they are unable to evaluate the complex goods and services on the market today . For example , people need insurance ? but few people understand enough to purchase it wisely . Thus , individuals generally end up with more insurance than they need , more expensive coverages , and so on . The FTC needs vast powers in order to provide consumers with the information and the assistance they need to make rational purchasing decisions . Consumer sovereignty is meaningless unless consumers are able to break through the veil of complexity behind which business can hide.3 SUGGESTED ANSWERS Exercise A Answer The controversy addressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alter the market structure in particular industries . The author criticizes misguided federal agencies and compliments the efficiency of private decision-making . The market is suggested as the preferred method of determining prices and minimizing costs . Our best guess would be that the author is reflecting the conservative paradigm . A liberal would probably prefer a larger role for governmental agencies in providing consumers with improved product information so the market could work more consistently with consumer preferences . Footnote 74 WHAT ECONOMIC PARADIGM IS SHAPING THE ANALYSIS ? Exercise B Answer The tone of this piece of economic analysis is very critical of governmental intervention in the economy . If we knew no more than this negative attitude toward state action , we would probably guess that the author is reflecting either the conservative or democratic socialist paradigms . To distinguish between these two possibilities , we should look at the nature of the specific criticisms of governmental action . Government is not criticized in this excerpt because it disturbs market decision-making . Instead , the author implies that the government is the instrument of the wealthy . Thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This criticism exemplifies the type of analysis made by democratic socialists . Exercise C Answer This excerpt is similar to the first one in supporting market decisions in preference to governmental attempts to regulate the price of various forms of energy . However , it is possible that this excerpt is written by a liberal who is disenchanted with governmental regulation of energy prices . The belief that government should provide incentives for the market development of alternative energy sources is more consistent with the liberal paradigm than the conservative paradigm . Conservatives would probably contend that if only government would stop regulating energy prices , the profit motive will adequately stimulate entrepreneurs to search for alternative supply sources . From the brief excerpt itself , it is not possible to make a confident prediction about whether this analysis is liberal or conservative . 6 What Economic Goals Is the Analyst Emphasizing ? ? Descriptions of Economic Goals and Methods of Achieving Them ? Economic Criteria ? Inferring Economic Goals ? Practice Exercises ? Your Turn to Practice ? Suggested Answers When someone asks various economists about the probable economic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different responses . Different economists have different priorities with respect to the desirability of particular effects . The reason that " economic effects " may be discussed in different patterns is because economists 76 WHAT ECONOMIC GOALS IS THE ANALYST EMPHASIZING ? disagree about the relative importance of various economic goals . Consequently , they will emphasize the impact on certain economic goals and largely ignore the effects on other economic goals . This chapter will make you aware of the primary economic goals . If you keep this list of goals in mind as you evaluate economic advice , you will be able to recognize when only certain economic effects are being discussed and others are being ignored . If you think that the economic impacts that were ignored are at least as important as those that were discussed , you will have to supply the missing analysis . Many times an economist will analyze an economic problem by stressing the impacts on those goals he or she thinks are important . The resulting analysis should be accepted by you only after you ascertain whether the economist 's goal priorities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Try to discover the author 's economic goals on the basis of her reasoning . We have sufficient supplies of coal to satisfy our long-term needs . With abundant energy from coal , we could resist the developments of recent years toward slower growth and persistent inflation . However , a 1,000 megawatt coal-fired plant produces tens of thousands of truckloads of ash every year . If scrubbers are used to reduce air pollution , tons and tons of sludge would be collected every year . Should we play havoc with the future of our environment by relying more on coal ? Can you identify the most fundamental of the author 's several goals ? After you have completed this chapter , this task will be much simpler . Remember that the purpose of the skill is to enable you to compare your economic goals to those of the economist . This chapter defines several economic goals and discusses how success toward those goals can be measured . Also presented are criteria or overall measures of success when more than one goal is involved and how the analyst 's priorities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , clues are provided that will help you infer the analyst 's goals when they are not explicitly stated . The economic goals that will be discussed in this chapter are economic growth , full employment , price stability , fair income distribution , economic freedom , consumer sovereignty , efficiency , and environmental protection . You should notice that the list is comprised of attractive concepts . It is a list of goals , so almost any economist would be in favor of all of them . Similarly , most , if not // all , economists make the claim that each of the goals on the list is worthwhile . What differentiates one economist or economy from another is not their goals so much as the weights or priorities they attach to each goal . Thus , it is not particularly helpful to recognize that an economist embraces the goal of full employment unless you can also identify his or her attitude toward other economic goals . Such factors as the implicit definition of the goal advocated , the probability that the proposed economic policy will achieve certain goals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as clues hinting at economic priorities . DESCRIPTIONS OF ECONOMIC GOALS AND METHODS OF ACHIEVING THEM Economic Growth When a country experiences economic growth , the growth is measured by a rate of increase in real gross national product per capita . All of the criticisms that are made of GNP as an imprecise and inaccurate measure of social well-being apply equally to economic growth . Such criticisms are less likely to be made by conservatives because GNP is the sum of all market values produced in a given year . Since conservatives see equilibrium prices as providing a true reflection of consumer desires , the GNP is respected as the best available indicator of social well-being . Those paradigms that are more nervous about the quality of market decisions are understandably critical of a national focus on economic growth . Economic growth is encouraged by several types of economic policies . Maintenance of a high level of aggregate demand encourages high production levels . The latter are translated into marketable goods and services and eventually become components of GNP . Encouragement of capital goods production provides a second avenue to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restrict current consumption goods production and thereby expand the output of goods that produce other goods , GNP will be expanded in succeeding periods . Capital goods production increases the likelihood of technological changes that would enhance productivity of an average worker . Finally , any policy like vocational 78 WHAT ECONOMIC GOALS IS THE ANALYST EMPHASIZING ? training that improves the quality of existing resources will improve the prospects for economic growth . Full Employment As with several of the economic goals that follow , full employment is often defined in different ways by those who advocate it . The nature of the definition offers one of the strongest clues possible as to the economist 's dedication to the goal being discussed . If the economist defines the goal in such a way that it is difficult to attain without incurring substantial opportunity costs , then she or he holds the goal in relatively high esteem . An example would be defining full employment as describing an economy where the unemployment rate is 3 percent or less . Conversely , a definition of the economic goal that would be easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the economist 's hierarchy of economic goals . For example , if the number I choose to represent full employment is an 8-percent rate of unemployment , I know that full employment will not be a major focus since it is probably already attained . Full employment has no technical definition . It is a label applied to an employment level by an economist who sees that particular level as worthy of pursuit . For example , conservative economists typically define full employment as a 93-percent employment rate . When only 7 percent of the labor force is unemployed , a conservative would proclaim " full employment , " signifying that anyone who really wants and needs a job will be employed at that level of unemployment . A more liberal economist may state that full employment is not attained until an unemployment rate of 4 percent is reached . Clearly , the goal of full employment is much more significant in the eyes of this economist . Neither of the definitions is right or wrong in a technical sense . They simply represent differing economic priorities with respect to economic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are two general techniques for stimulating full employment . Cyclical unemployment is controlled by expansionary monetary and fiscal policy . Increasing aggregate demand expands the demand for labor and creates a greater number of job vacancies . Structural unemployment is solved by targeted fiscal policies designed specifically to create jobs for particular populations or to improve the employability of selected groups of unemployed . The latter policy requires a more active governmental role since the government is deciding how funds // will be spent . Measures to simply increase aggregate demand may actually enlarge the relative scope of market decisions since tax cuts are one of the most common forms of fiscal stimulus in the American economy . Price Stability Price stability , like full employment , has no technical definition on which all reasonable economists can agree . An extreme version of the goal would be no inflation whatsoever . If your economy is accustomed to double-digit inflation , then a 6-percent rise in the Consumer or Wholesale Price Index may cause an economist to proclaim a new era of price stability . The most detrimental effects of inflation are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On the other hand , inflation may be beneficial to certain borrowers who , as a result of inflation , pay their creditors with money that has greatly diminished purchasing power . Firms and labor organizations with market power may also gain from inflation since an era of rapidly rising prices reduces consumer hostility to and surprise at a new wave of price increases . In such an environment , price increases can exceed increases in the cost of production without arousing as much enmity from those who seek to restrict the use of market power . Solutions to inflation vary , depending on the type of inflation being addressed . Demand-pull inflation consists of increases in factor and product market prices caused by high levels of aggregate demand . Reductions in one or more of the components of total spending provide the remedy for this variant of inflation . Cost-push , profit-push , and supply-side inflation are all names for inflation caused by market power . When firms or factors possess the ability to obtain a price in excess of competitive prices , the effect of their behavior is inflationary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disasters , international cartels , or sudden technological changes may all cause inflation but may be outside the scope of influence of a particular economy . Equity or Fair Income Distribution One economist 's fairness may be another 's injustice . Equity is sometimes expressed as treating equals equally and unequals differentially in proportion to their unequal performance . Such a de80 WHAT ECONOMIC GOALS IS THE ANALYST EMPHASIZING ? scription of fairness is not very helpful , however , because the definition of equity has now simply been " changed " into the identical debate over the meaning of " equals " and " performance . " Equity is frequently conceptualized by identifying the shares of income or wealth possessed by relevant groups in the economy . Chapter 10 offers a more complete explanation of the role of equity in our economy . Equity is approached or avoided by altering tax and expenditure decisions . There is probably no such thing as a neutral expenditure or tax in the sense that it would have no distributional impact whatsoever . The policy tools for achieving whatever form of equity is desired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and divergent definitions of equity are more responsible for whatever inequity exists than inadequacies in economic tools . If a society agrees on the desirability of a particular degree of inequality , a tax or expenditure policy that would achieve that form of equity is available . Economic Freedom Whenever freedom is discussed , you should immediately ask whose freedom specifically to do what . The reason for these queries is that there are many kinds of freedom , some of which are mutually exclusive . Consumers and sellers , for example , have certain interests that conflict inevitably ; the conflicts are inherent in the two roles . Freedom for one of these groups , e.g. , the freedom to discover complete product information , may conflict directly with the freedom of the other , e.g. , the freedom to use one 's property in whatever way one may see fit . Economic freedom may consist of the freedom of sellers to sell their product or service in whatever form , at whatever price , and to whomever they choose . Alternatively , it may refer to the freedom to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then retain power over that wealth after it is attained . Economic freedom is acquired by resisting restrictions on the opportunities you wish to see preserved and by supporting those activities , such as statutes , that enlarge the scope of the opportunities you wish to see expanded . Notice that the orientation of this particular definition of economic freedom is toward freedoms of the seller or producer . // Consumer Sovereignty Basic capitalistic theory is premised on the idea that the ultimate beneficiary of the economic process should be the consumer . Consistent with that orientation , prices represent consumer signals to producers concerning how many resources should be devoted to production of a particular good or service . Prices also provide consumers with information concerning the availability of resources for production . Consumer sovereignty refers to consumer control over what is produced and the form that that production will take . In contrast to consumer sovereignty is producer sovereignty , the manipulation of consumer tastes by sellers . Consumer sovereignty is stimulated by increasing the competitiveness of markets , enlarging the magnitude of available consumer information , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ output from a given cost . To become more efficient gives the appearance of getting something for nothing , i.e. , more outputs from the same cost . However , efficiency measures are not cost-free ; specific groups benefit from inefficiency and they consequently resist efforts designed to achieve efficiency . When inefficiency occurs , someone is receiving an income in excess of what would actually be received if there were greater efficiency . Understandably , such a person resists efficiency for he or she does not want to lose the excess income being received . Actually , various definitions of the appropriate output may be so different that one form of social efficiency will be wasteful in someone else 's eyes . Thus , in discussion of efficiency , the definition of output is crucial to the argument . Environmental Protection As is true for each of the other economic goals , environmental protection has many adherents in the abstract ; almost anyone wants to " protect the environment . " Yet , what exactly is meant by environmental protection ? Several alternatives are available : ( 1 ) returning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have existed in a more pristine period , ( 2 ) maintaining the existing 82 WHAT ECONOMIC GOALS IS THE ANALYST EMPHASIZING ? level of environmental quality , or ( 3 ) creating standards to assure that the environment does not surpass specified levels of depredation . Any of these definitions can be expected to be met with substantial opposition because various sectors of the economy would be harmed regardless of which of these options are chosen . Governmental regulations , tax incentives to private firms , or governmental sponsorship of ecologically sound research are all suggested techniques for providing environmental protection . ECONOMIC CRITERIA We have now defined several possible economic goals . Is n't it likely that an economist might seek achievement of more than one goal at a time ? Which of us really wants to suffer high inflation and low employment ? But what if we are forced to choose between high inflation combined with high employment and low inflation combined with low employment ? In deciding between such options , the question is : How much weight do we assign to each goal ? Surely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ analysis is made in pursuit of economic goals . The weights that the analyst assigns each goal reflect the analyst 's paradigm and preferences . In fact , a very helpful way to discover the analyst 's paradigm is to examine the weights she or he assigns to the various goals . The analyst 's goals may also be reflected in another way . The analyst may choose to omit some goals from consideration . This omission indicates that the analyst feels that those goals are not important , or at least not important for the problem at hand . If you feel that the omitted variables are important , you will want to note how their omission affects the analysis . In the formulation of the criterion for choosing among economic options , we have identified two ways for the analyst 's preferences to enter . The first is by the choice of goals about which the analyst is concerned , and a second is by attaching weights to the various goals . Let us examine these matters in a little more detail . The basic idea of a criterion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is good . Put another way , when faced with alternatives , the criterion tells which alternative the economist thinks is best . The criterion is a definition of " better " or " best . " The trouble is that the economist rarely tells what his or her definition of " better " is , so you must guess . Clearly , the economist 's definition of what is // " best " may differ from your own , in which case you would want to reject his or her advice . In general , economists rarely have a common view of what is good and consequently a particular economist 's definition of what is good depends on that person 's values and preferences . So what is important to you is to see how the economist emphasizes particular goals . There are some concepts that almost all economists would agree are good . For instance , when allocating resources we should at least reach situations where we can not improve one person 's position without hurting someone else . But there are many such allocations . The economic expert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to choose among these allocations . Let us now confront the main issue . How can you know what the expert 's criteria for choice are ? When the analyst says that her or his solution is good because . . . , the things that follow the " because " are presumably the things that the analyst values . To some extent you have to be aware of the other alternatives facing the analyst to correctly deduce his or her preferences . Consider this example : When confronted with the choice of fighting inflation or unemployment , the rational government will always fight inflation first since inflation is a tax that affects all the citizens . What is the analyst 's criteria for deciding what is rational ? The answer in this case is the number of people affected by the economic illness . In the eyes of this analyst , a 5-percent inflation rate is worse than 25 percent unemployment . Why ? Because according to this individual more people are affected by inflation . Here 's another ex-ample : In Los Angeles , the smog problem gets worse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work . A better solution would be to require people with older cars or cars that pollute heavily to pay much higher license fees . The current government rules just do not work because compliance can not be obtained . What is this analyst 's criteria ? Apparently the objective is to remove smog . But the real criterion is the basis for choosing higher license fees over government regulations . What is this criterion ? The author prefers a mechanism where compliance or enforcement is relatively easy to obtain . Under current government anti-pollution laws , we can not generally police the law to provide sufficient improvements in air quality . 84 WHAT ECONOMIC GOALS IS THE ANALYST EMPHASIZING ? Before we go on , there is one word that deserves special focus here . The word is rational . Economists seem to have a special affinity for this word . It turns up in phrases like the " rational consumer " or the " rational firm . " What does it mean ? In general , the adjective rational is used in economics to refer to an economic actor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reflect on the mental health of the actor . Be sure that you do not start believing that rational economic behavior is necessarily sane . Just because some analyst specifies rational economic behavior need not imply that it would be irrational to reject the analyst 's advice . If you wish to maximize something different , then you may rationally opt for an altogether different policy alternative . INFERRING ECONOMIC GOALS An economic analyst may explicitly tell you his or her goals . However , even in this rather rare eventuality , you will still be lacking the kind of understanding required for you to match your goals with those of the analyst . As pointed out earlier in the chapter , since all economic goals are desirable , what is important to know is the priority the analyst attaches to her or his various economic goals . If three economic goals are specified , but the first two conflict with the third , it is not clear what the analyst 's criteria are . Thus , you will find it difficult to compare her or his goals with yours . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ priorities will be to read the analysis and then ask yourself , " If the analyst reasons in that manner , what goal priorities must he or she have ? " The basic clue for inferring economic goals is to ( 1 ) check the policy the economist is advocating , ( 2 ) think about its impacts , then ( 3 ) presume that those impacts are consistent with the analyst 's goal priorities . If the end result of an economist 's argument is a proposal for a consumer protection agency , it is a good hunch that he or she prefers consumer sovereignty to the goal of economic freedom , defined here as the freedom of producers to produce their output in the form that is most consistent with their own wishes . When an economist advocates a reduction of government expenditures , it is not necessarily true , but it is a sensible guess , that he or she prefers price stability to full employment as an economic goal . In this chapter we have urged you to be sensitive to the goals of the analyst and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goals and policies . At this point , try to reread the example on the first page of this chapter . Can you now do an improved job of identifying the author 's goals and criteria ? PRACTICE EXERCISES For each of the following passages , try to identify the author 's economic goals . Where the author is choosing to weight certain goals , attempt to isolate the criteria he or she is using to choose among goals . Exercise A As a result of egalitarian policies , the income distribution in the United States has become more equal . Furthermore , the tremendous amount of redistribution taking place every year makes attempts toward even greater equality extremely costly . The costs stem from the effect that increasing marginal tax rates ( to redistribute income ) have on incentives . The more an individual 's earnings are taxed , the less incentive there is to work . Similarly , the incentives of those who receive the transfer payment are reduced . Why work when money or goods and services are available for not working ? Thus , economic growth is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have little incentive to strive and those on the bottom have little incentive to become employed.l Footnote 86 WHAT ECONOMIC GOALS IS THE ANALYST EMPHASIZING ? Exercise B Almost all our major economic problems can be solved if we solve our most pressing economic problem ? the inevitable monetary results of persistently overheating our economy . To counteract this problem , we should do the following : 1 . Attain a balanced federal budget . 2 . Restrain the Federal Reserve from funding excessive debt . 3 . Promote productivity . 4 . Eliminate federal regulation that chokes the market system . 5 . Promote domestic development of energy resources . Exercise C The United States Steelworkers Union is seeking to attain a contract provision that would gain them either guaranteed work or pay each year for all steelworkers . We realize , however , that management must retain flexibility in running the steel mills . Unless we are reasonable in our demands , the firms will not be able to pay our members . One of the biggest arguments on our behalf is the rapid economic growth the Japanese have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other things , the job guarantees provided by Japanese firms . // YOUR TURN TO PRACTICE Exercise D In the future when developers propose progress , recall the case of the Alaskan pipeline . Sure , the 800-mile pipeline cost billions of dollars and thus created many jobs for an economy plagued by persistent recession . However , the costs that did not appear in the reported statistics are huge . The results range from water pollution caused by improperly constructed sewage-treatment plants to extensive oil spills . Moose migration patterns have been permanently upset . Some excavated areas have caused massive erosion . If this is what economic growth means , might it not make more sense to oppose such progress ? SUGGESTED ANSWERS Exercise A Answer This analyst is alarmed about the trend toward greater equality . We know what he does not like . We can discover his apparent goals by studying the rationale he gives for his conclusion . The negative effect , he claims , would result from more equality is a decline in work incentives . Thus , the productivity of our labor force would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improving economic growth is an improved use of existing resources . The fact that the author wants to obtain more output from current labor resources indicates a preference for heightened economic growth , especially when that alternative is contrasted with increased equality . 88 WHAT ECONOMIC GOALS IS THE ANALYST EMPHASIZING ? Exercise B Answer This passage is difficult . The author never tells us ( in terms of economic goals ) what she hopes to achieve . We will necessarily have to infer the author 's goals from the policy proposals she makes . Studying each of the proposals and thinking about what an " overheated economy " means suggests that the author is calling for a movement toward greater price stability . Each of the proposals provided in the passage has been suggested by various economists as a possible solution for inflation . The author does not tell us that costs would be associated with her proposals so we can not tell what criterion she used to choose among goals . Exercise C Answer This passage is a brief argument for a contract provision that would guarantee the steelworkers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ author is not so interested in full employment in the economy as in the economic security for steelworkers . The recognition that management needs to retain production and scheduling flexibility indicates the author 's desire for efficiency as well as economic security . Economic growth is mentioned as a possible effect of the contract provision , but the central goal of the author is economic security . Economic growth appears to be a desirable by-product of what the author is advocating , not the primary focus . What economic criterion did the author use to choose among economic growth , efficiency , and economic security ? The answer is in the third sentence . Above all , the author wants an economic goal that will preserve the maximum number of jobs for members of the United States Steelworkers Union . That criterion is the test that an economic goal must meet for the writer to embrace its pursuit . Appendix to Chapter 6 : More on Economic Criteria The main body of Chapter 6 has pointed out the need for and role of the author 's decision-making criteria in economic analysis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the importance of these criteria by examining two criteria that frequently appear in economic analysis . This material has been relegated to an appendix for two reasons . First , it overlaps what traditional texts do and is included to provide a link with the typical textual material . Because this material involves some technical analysis , it may not be of interest to all readers , so an appendix is an appropriate place for it . Second , we view this book to be of interest to many advanced economics students who could profit from a more extensive treatment of criteria . The appendix contains the following material : The basic concept of a criterion is reviewed . Next we argue that the most common criterion in economics is that something is maximized . A basic requirement for the maximum to be defined is then considered . An 90 WHAT ECONOMIC GOALS IS THE ANALYST EMPHASIZING ? argument is made concerning the scope of the maximization hypothesis , and , finally , we discuss the thing to be maximized : profit or utility . What do we mean by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " goal " for a specific target like full employment or price stability . By a criterion or objective we mean an amalgamation of goals . Of course if there is only one goal , then the goal and criterion or objective are all the same . In economics a criterion is made up of two parts : a measurement of success and a behavioral assumption . The behavioral assumption is a statement that tells how the economic actor applies the measure of success . What kinds of behavioral assumptions are typically made in economics ? Perhaps the most common assumption is that something is maximized . In other words , the behavior assumed is that the economic actor chooses the largest of the criteria possible . Sometimes the economic actor is directed to choose the smallest . We will discuss the maximizing assumption , but similar comments hold concerning minima . For the analyst to choose the largest or the smallest as a behavior rule requires that the measure of success associated with each alternative be a number . The measure of success can not associate a pair of numbers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not know how to decide which pair of numbers is largest . For example , if one is asked to choose between high inflation combined with high employment and low inflation together with low employment , there is no one choice to which everyone would agree . Thus , any time one is confronted with choosing among combinations of goals ( in this example we are choosing among several combinations of unemployment and inflation ) , no clear-cut way to choose among the combinations may exist . Yet , if we are asked whether more inflation is better or worse than less inflation the answer is clear . Observe that when we need to compare one combination with another combination , the comparison and resulting choice depend on the chooser . The point is that we can not unambiguously say that one combination is bigger than another . The reason for this is that we are not comparing one number with another where the definition of bigger is plain to all , but we are trying to compare pairs of numbers where bigger is not defined . Thus , for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the biggest ) we can not be comparing combinations to other combinations ; we must compare one number // to another number . Yet , clearly , economists want to be able to compare the combination of high unemployment and low inflation to the combination of high employment and high inflation . The economist ( and you ) can not just ignore this problem of how to compare pairs of things . We will come back to this a little later . Let 's consider another example of the problem of defining a maximum when more than one output is defined . Suppose we consider an oil refinery that produces gasoline , kerosene , and various fuel oils . What is the efficient way to produce output ? By definition , we want to maximize output for a given level of cost . But if we maximize the amount of gasoline , we will want to reduce all other outputs as much as possible . Thus , we can not maximize the output of gasoline , kerosene , and the various fuels at the same time . We can not simultaneously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ various fuel oils to be produced ; surely we can not even add them together . The point of this example is to again warn you that the idea of a maximum is not well-defined when the thing to be maximized is to be measured by several components ( gasoline , kerosene , fuel oils ) . To correctly approach the idea of efficiency in this case , a new formulation of the idea of " maximum " must be provided . We return now to the importance of the maximization hypothesis . To the extent that economics has scientific ( positive ) content ( makes testable hypotheses about the world ) , the scientific content derives to a large measure from the maximization hypothesis . Why is the assumption so widespread ? Do economists really believe that all individuals are really little calculating machines who make decisions based on their calculations of maxima ? In fact , the answer to the latter question is no . But the former question is the one of interest . It turns out that when choices are made in a consistent fashion , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Thus , even if a consumer or firm did not consciously act to maximize something in its choice process , we will be able to represent the choice process as if it had been generated by the consumer or firm acting to maximize something . Hence , the hypothesis that something is maximized is a very general choice model ; that is why it will be the primary focus of our attention . The next questions concerning the criterion are : What do economists assume is maximized ? What is the measure of success ? There 92 WHAT ECONOMIC GOALS IS THE ANALYST EMPHASIZING ? are two general forms that the maximand ( that which is to be maximized ? the objective of criterion ) usually takes : the first is profit and the second is utility . We shall discuss each separately . Economists typically assume that firms act to maximize profit where profit is the total income minus total cost . In fact , the hypothesis is so prevalent that even when talking about not-for-profit firms , the most popular assumption is that they act to maximize profit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be concerned only about the profit that its actions generate . How can you , as a consumer of information , decide whether or not the firm 's criterion is assumed to be maximization of profit ? It is safe to presume , unless you are explicitly told otherwise , that the economist has assumed that firms maximize profit . There may be times when the economist slips an alternate assumption into the argument . Suppose , for example , that you read the following argument : The modern firm is reluctant to pollute not because there are laws against it but because the firm knows that if it does pollute , it will offend its neighbors and give itself a bad name . In the above quote , the author argues that the level of pollution will be low because the firm is not only concerned about the profit but about its public image as well . In general you can spot whether the economist is making the criteria more comprehensive than profit if the author advocates activities that may reduce the company 's profits . But what criterion is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ criteria are there ? As we indicated before , another alternative is utility . By utility we mean an assignment of numbers to each combination of goals . The assignment of numbers is made to reflect the actor 's preferences . Thus , bundles that are preferred are assigned higher numbers . Note that utility is a single number that amalgamates goals . It therefore makes sense to maximize utility when the criteria are composed of more than one goal . In fact , utility is a code word for preferences . When economists talk about utility , they reflect the fact that underlying the measure of success are humans with preferences and values . In fact , it is well known among economists that the minimum information required to solve a choice problem is a set of alternatives and the actor 's preferences . Yet , rather than talk about the actor 's preferences , most // economists talk about the actor 's utility . Why ? Because it is easier to express utility and hard to find a way to represent the actor 's preferences . Further , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ construct a utility function . Thus , we lose very little by talking about utility and gain ease of exposition . It is clearly true that the actor 's values will dictate which variables appear in the actor 's preferences and will also dictate which variables are most important or get the heaviest weight . Hence , we will talk about utility but understand that underlying utility is the more primitive concept of preferences , and we recognize that this is the point where values enter the discussion . In a certain sense , the term utility is excess baggage since we could always just talk about preferences to accomplish the same purpose . But since the term is widely used in economic analysis , we will use it here . Utility is used as a criterion in many different cases . Anytime there is more than one goal , utility is used to make combinations of goals comparable . Again , utility assigns to each combination a real number . Numbers can be compared to see which is larger in a way that combinations of goals can not be compared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is more than one goal . If there are two compatible goals , goals that do not compete with each other , then there is no difficulty in the choice process . We want to achieve more of each goal . Maximizing in terms of one goal does not affect maximizing in terms of the other goal . But this case is so rare that it is uninteresting . The more typical case is where the goals compete with each other . Then if we maximize in terms of one objective , we must reduce the other . To maximize both goals at the same time does not make sense . How can we resolve this dilemma and still maintain the character of the maximization problem ? The solution is to use utility , which depends on the combination of goals . Since utility is one number , the idea of a maximum is well defined . Consider this example . Most economists contend that full employment and stable prices can not be simultaneously achieved . Thus , there are not policies that economists can prescribe which will simultaneously allow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be stable . We therefore have to choose which combination of goals we wish to achieve . The policy maker will want to maximize utility where utility depends on the level of employment and the stability of the price level . The idea of maximizing utility then allows us to put the 94 WHAT ECONOMIC GOALS IS THE ANALYST EMPHASIZING ? competing goals together into one measure of success . Thus , to maximize utility makes sense in a way that maximizing employment and stable prices does not . It is clear that utility itself is neither measurable nor observable . Utility does measure the actor 's preferences in some sense , but it does not matter what scale we use to measure the preferences . If we multiplied every utility number by 2 , we would still have the same ranking of alternatives and the maximizing choice would not change . Thus , the scale we use for utility does not matter . ( Nor would it matter if we added 10 to every utility number . ) The ranking of the bundles by their utility number would not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no consequence . In this case , we say that utility is ordinal and argue that utility measures the actor 's ranking of alternatives or preferences , but utility itself is not measurable in a unique way . The lack of these features does not deter the economist . What is important is that the economist has a way of modeling the decision process and thus suggesting policy actions , predicting the impact of policy actions , or describing how the economy works . The notion of utility is essential to the economist so that the problem of competing objectives can be overcome . What goes into the utility function ? Any goals that may be of concern to the chooser . Thus , the economist who attempts to model some economic phenomenon selects an economic actor who makes decisions ( a chooser ) , and then examines the objectives that this chooser might have . If there is more than one goal , the economist will aggregate them by using utility . We might think of utility as assigning weights to the various objectives . Clearly , the goals that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the weights that the economist assigns each goal is surely a matter dictated by the values of that economist . So far we have seemed to suggest that utility is some kind of weighting of the goals . We note that there is no reason why the weighting system need be simple or constant . Let 's consider the following example : Suppose that an analyst facing 10 percent inflation and 8 percent unemployment puts heavier weight on inflation than unemployment . Suppose that the analyst would like to achieve 2 percent inflation and 4 percent unemployment . Now suppose the analyst 's policies are enacted , some time passes , and we find ourselves at 3 percent inflation and 7 percent unemployment . Would it be unreasonable or unlikely that the analyst would now place higher // priority on reducing unemployment than reducing inflation ? The point is that the analyst 's priorities may not be constant in the sense of always preferring to pursue one goal over another . In this example , there were definite targets to be achieved : 4 percent unemployment and 2 percent inflation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not always be given . For example , in the idea of efficiency , we are to make the output of a firm as large as possible . The requirement is not to make output as close to some target value as possible , but to make output as large as possible . Both are perfectly acceptable ways to formulate a criterion . There is one other sense in which the word utility is sometimes used , and we should be careful to understand it . Some economists talk about social welfare or social utility ( social well-being ) . Such a use of utility does not directly depend on preferences . Most economists who discuss social utility use the term as if it depended on the utility of the individual consumers in the society . An alternative meaning of social utility is that social welfare depends on the consumption of the individuals in the society . In either case , can we argue that a social utility function somehow represents the preferences of society ? If we require that preferences of the society be internally consistent , then the answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that essentially says that consistent social preferences can not be aggregated from the preferences of individuals unless there is a dictator . Thus , social utility does not represent some consistent set of social preferences . So , when an author talks about social welfare or social utility , you , the reader , will want to ask what is meant by social welfare since the notion is supposed to represent how the whole society feels about the alternatives , not just what the author wants the society to feel . 7 What Constraints Are Assumed in the Analysis ? ? Common Economic Tradeoffs ? Additional Restrictions on Choice ? Practice Exercises ? Your Turn to Practice ? Suggested Answers In this chapter we will talk about the constraints placed on economic actors . The nature of the problem is that an economic actor frequently would like to choose more of something but can not . What is there that keeps one from choosing more ? The answer may be that there is some constraint or limit that keeps one from choosing more . This chapter is designed to help you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have this ability now . Then after you are finished with this chapter you will want to come back and reexamine this exercise . // Despite their awareness that such actions will cause labor unrest and economic misery for many workers , the management of American railroads wants to eliminate many of their unnecessary personnel . They would like to cut train and yard crews and start paying trainmen by the hour instead of by the mileage . This urge to reduce personnel is developing concurrently with heightened union activity . The unions are demanding large wage increases and job security provisions . Management must decide whether to resist the unions or focus their energies instead on legislation that would revitalize capital investment and demand in the ailing industry . Perhaps the easy strategy would be to seek taxpayer subsidy for the industry , grant the current union wage demands , and establish long-range contractual obligations that would commit the union to permit eventual cutbacks in personnel . In constructing models of choice the economist needs two major elements : an objective or criterion and a set of alternatives from which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time and effort discovering what objectives the analyst has . The analysis of the choice problem is not complete until you have examined the alternatives that could have been chosen as well as those that could not be chosen . How can one discern these limits on choice ? Before answering that question , let 's look at an alternative way of viewing the problem of economic constraints . Both the objective and the set of alternatives contain tradeoffs , i.e. , the gains from one goal require losses in terms of certain other goals . It is quite natural for you to want more of all the goals ? more employment , price stability , economic freedom , equity , etc . Yet , no matter how skillfully certain goals are pursued , there are associated costs that can be analyzed in terms of other goals that are consequently frustrated . The next section highlights several typical tradeoffs that face the economic decision maker . This chapter then urges you to search for other types of constraints and suggests some typical ones . COMMON ECONOMIC TRADEOFFS In the last chapter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be measured . The goals that we discussed were full employment , price stability , economic equity , economic // efficiency , economic freedom , consumer sovereignty , and so on . Many of these goals naturally conflict . The conflict means that we can not choose more of one without yielding somewhat in our pursuit of a conflicting economic goal . Thus , these tradeoffs prevent us from reaching our most preferred position . We may be able to alter the tradeoffs some , but their major impact will still be there and can not be ignored . In short , these tradeoffs impose restrictions on our choices . From the preceding discussion , you probably have the impression that the pursuit of any economic goal has costs associated with it . One way of viewing these costs is to recognize certain tradeoffs that may exist when a particular goal is emphasized . Many tradeoffs are possible and only a few will be mentioned here to give you a flavor of the complexity of economic goals and their achievement . Economic Growth vs . Price Stability . One of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the employment of idle resources . Increasing the level of aggregate demand may accomplish this objective . However , dependent on the initial unemployment rate and the relationship between the new demand for resources and the quality of the supply of resources available to meet the demand , this same expenditure increase will have an inflationary effect . By the same reasoning , attacking inflation by reducing the level of aggregate demand may have a harmful impact on growth . Economic Growth vs . Environmental Protection . One of the most disruptive factors affecting the environment is technological change . New chemicals , processes , and tools all create new impositions on the environment . Noise levels , water quality , energy utilization rates , and waste disposal facilities are all affected by technological change . Yet , technological change that enhances the potential output from a given resource or even redefines what we consider a resource is a major source of economic growth . Full Employment vs .
