The scream is one of the indigenous sounds of city life , like an automobile alarm that whoops and heaves , then stops , leaving the question hanging like a hawk as to whether a car was broken into , or did its owner set off the alarm by accident , and then lay it to rest . With human screams , the question is more complicated , since screams are not mechanical or automatic . Did you hear that , Harry ? What could it be ? A scream of delight , of fright ? Hilarity , Harry ? Do you think that someone is laughing too hard ? Could it be hysteria , madness ? Or ; is it a scream of blue murder ? What should we do , Harry , if it is a scream of blue murder ? And where is it coming from , anyway ? Could you tell ? I could n't tell . <P> A Manhattan couple was charged last week with the murder by beating of their six-year-old adopted daughter . Neighbors never had any difficulty telling where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had trouble discerning exactly who was doing the screaming , the six-year-old girl or the woman who lived with the father . The woman is accused of " acting in concert " in the murder , but clearly her own life buckled under regular punches . She wore dark glasses , and would attribute her recomposed face to a mugging or a fall in the kitchen . Over the years , colleagues and friends chose to believe the mugging and accident stories . Neighbors who heard the screams firsthand placed dozens of telephone calls to the police and to city authorities , who investigated but could prove no harm . The authorities did not hear the screams . After her beatings , the child lay brain dead , and the couple was in custody . Now no one in that building hears the screams . <P> But in other buildings in New York , in other cities , in all the cities , new screams will take up the slack . Sometimes the authorities will respond , sometimes not . The beating of women and children will continue in the hidden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will hear the scream , and someone else will tell you that it was n't a scream , it was a kettle whistle ; and no one will be sure if there ever was a scream , until a body lies in evidence . How is the citizen-listener to react ? Rush wildly through the corridors until the sound is unmistakable ? Push open some stranger 's door to confront some stranger 's scream ? Much courage is required for that . Much recklessness as well . The helplessness you feel in such situations is dizzying ; and even when you act , someone in power can let you down . You could be wrong . Foolish . You could be sued . <P> Civilization is tested by its screams . One has the choice to hear or not to hear ; to detect location or not to detect location ; to discover cause ; to help or not to help . Along the many lines of choice , excuses and mistakes are possible , even reasonable . One is left with oneself and the screams , like two opponents . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which a young woman in Queens screamed for help , and everybody heard , and nobody helped . What were we to do ? Edvard Munch 's famous painting of The Cry keeps coming back , equally scary and bewildering . What are we to do ?
