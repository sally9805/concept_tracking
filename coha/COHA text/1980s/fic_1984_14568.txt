( Lights up slowly on NEVA , elegantly draped in a fine shawl , and writing in an ornate leather diary . ) NEVA I was born Neva Tyler in 1904 . I was the daughter of Hiram Tyler and Miss Birdie Mae Coleman . We grew up in a large house in Paradise . ( A small smile . ) ( Lights up slowly on BIRDIE MAE , rocking gently and crocheting . ) BIRDIE MAE Paradise . I was borned Miss Birdie Mae Coleman in 1889 . Kentucky is probably the best place in the world to live . Specially if yer from Paradise . NEVA My father 's family was old and respected in the South : the Tylers were important figures in American history . BIRDIE MAE I come from a big family , seven sisters an ' three brothers . An ' I was the baby . NEVA In summers many of the children in our family would be sent to spend several weeks at Grandfather Tyler 's house up near Louisville . I remember winding staircases , dark , polished wood , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind the main house : during the day the smell of meats roasting and breads baking would fill the balmy air . p. 3 BIRDIE MAE We lived in a ol ' farmhouse an ' we was mighty crowded in , though one time we had lotsa money , cotton money . Least , that 's what my folks tole me . But I do n't remember it . I remember growin ' tobacco , all a us workin ' in the field , an ' not havin ' enough money fer shoes . I mean , there was a lot a us , an ' Daddy 's wives , too . He had hisself a number a wives : they jes ' kept dyin ' young on him . My mama was his fourth . ( Sighs . ) Georgia . NEVA We children had a playroom of our own ; its walls were made entirely of slate , and each of us had a private section to write on . I was fiercely protective of my section ; my cousin Lockey once wrote a message on my slate and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fault . I have always had a sweet disposition , like my dear mother . BIRDIE MAE ( Puts down crocheting and comes downstage . ) It was nice country , Paradise : rollin ' hills , mines an ' farms , an ' the Green River . There was lotsa room to git outside when we was all movin ' in on each other . I remember runnin ' along the road in my calico dress , ( Removes her shoes. ) real happy to be by myself with the soft dirt mushin ' up between my toes . Sometimes Daddy 'd take on extra work fattenin ' up horses fer the man up the road . They was nice horses : I used to sneak rides in the soft evenin ' light . WHOOF ! ( Like a fourteen-year-old , she jumps on the bed as though she were riding a horse . ) I 'd be on over them hills an ' back ' fore anybody knew I was gone . Jes ' givin ' ' em a little exercise , you might say . I remember eatin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big sister Bertha upside the head when she 'd talk smarty to me . Pretty much ever'body was afeard a me ' cause I got mad pretty easy . I did pretty much what I wanted . ( She lets down her hair . ) When I was about fourteen , I met Hiram . ( She goes to the counter to wash her hands in a bucket . HIRAM , a young man in his early twenties , appears at the door frame . He is dressed for formal courting , and he holds a bunch of daisies . He shifts nervously from foot to foot , wipes his sweaty hands on his pants . Knocks timidly . No one responds . Knocks louder . BIRDIE MAE is lifting her skirt and wiping her hands on the hem when she sees HIRAM in the doorway . She hastily drops her skirt. ) p. 4 BIRDIE MAE My goodness ! HIRAM Good evenin ' . BIRDIE MAE Who er you ? HIRAM ( Clears throat nervously . ) My name is Hiram Tyler . BIRDIE MAE ( Looks him over curiously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? HIRAM No , as a matter a fact BIRDIE MAE I mean , ai n't no Tylers jes ' round here . Now , mebbe over to the minin ' camps you 'd find yerself a one er two . HIRAM I ai n't really lookin ' fer Tylers . BIRDIE MAE Well , who you lookin ' fer ? ( Notices flowers . ) An ' what you doin ' with them flowers ? HIRAM I 'm I 'm bringin ' ' em fer you . BIRDIE MAE Fer me ? That 's a good ' un . You ai n't never seen me ' fore this very second . HIRAM No , I seen you the other day . BIRDIE MAE You never ! HIRAM I did too . It was gittin ' on to night , an ' you was ridin ' on a horse . BIRDIE MAE What kinda horse ? p. 5 HIRAM ( Nervous fidgeting . ) Well , the light were n't real good , so ( Sees BIRDIE MAE 's hard stare . ) Brown , I guess . HIRAM ( cont @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BIRDIE MAE ( Laughs wholeheartedly . ) Well , you bin found out fer a liar ! I do n't ride no brown horses . One I ride 's grey . An ' no spots , neither ! HIRAM Even so , I seen you . You was wearin ' that very dress , an ' yer hair was flyin ' . BIRDIE MAE I ai n't got but two dresses , so chances are I was wearin ' this ' un . HIRAM You was ridin ' in beauty , like the night . BIRDIE MAE You a salesman ? HIRAM With cloudy climes an ' starry skies . BIRDIE MAE Bet you are ! Right outta Indianapolis ! HIRAM I beg your pardon ? BIRDIE MAE So what 's that Cloudy Climes Company sell ? Magazines ? HIRAM What company ? BIRDIE MAE Cloudy Climes . Ai n't that what you said ? p. 6 HIRAM I was speakin ' of yer beauty . BIRDIE MAE ( Laughs . ) That 's a good ' un . Why n't you jes ' say it right out ? HIRAM I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? HIRAM I 'm aimin ' to please you .

HIRAM Please , Miz Coleman BIRDIE MAE Now , who tole you my name was Coleman ? HIRAM I bin askin ' ' bout you . BIRDIE MAE ( Very fast . ) What 's my first name ? HIRAM Birdie Mae . BIRDIE MAE Do n't mean nothin ' . Paradise ai n't no big place . Ever'body knows ever'body , jes ' like we was all sleepin ' in one big bed . What you sellin ' ? HIRAM I ai n't a salesman . I 'm a schoolteacher . BIRDIE MAE You ai n't ! HIRAM I travel round , an'l was jes ' comin ' through when I seen you . p. 7 BIRDIE MAE What 's five times five ? HIRAM Twenty-five . BIRDIE MAE Seven times seven ? HIRAM Forty-nine . BIRDIE MAE ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's got him . ) Ten times ten ? HIRAM A hunnerd . BIRDIE MAE Well , you must be a schoolteacher ! HIRAM I am .

( Sits at table with hands folded genteely . ) HIRAM May I may I come in first ? BIRDIE MAE A couple a steps . ( He does . ) That 's far enough ! Well ? Git on with it . HIRAM " That time a year thou mayst in me behole When yalla leaves er few er none do hang " p. 8 BIRDIE MAE ( Jumps up . ) Hold it ! I ai n't gittin ' none a it . HIRAM It 's a poem by a man name a Shakespeare , lived a long time ago . He was writin ' hisself a poem ' bout how he felt real ' ol , like a ol ' tree . BIRDIE MAE Well , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kinda makes me itch . Pardon me , I know it ai n't real ladylike , but I jes ' got ta scratch . ( Turns around demurely and scratches her stomach . ) HIRAM ( Politely averts his eyes . Then , when BIRDIE MAE has turned around . ) Wo n't you take these flowers ? BIRDIE MAE ( Looks over her shoulder uncertainly . ) Hang on a minute , an ' let me think . ( HIRAM looks confused . ) See , it probably never come into yer head to ask yerself how ol ' I am , ' cause I know I look real ol ' . Specially if I twist up my hair . ( She does , very self-consciously . ) But I ai n't so ol ' . ( Takes him into her confidence impulsively . ) I ai n't never had no man come a-courtin ' . HIRAM You ai n't ? BIRDIE MAE No , my mama said I were n't quite ol ' enough , an ' I were n't much interested neither . p. 9 HIRAM You were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm gittin ' right on into marryin ' age . HIRAM I 'm right glad to hear it . Then you kin take these flowers . BIRDIE MAE I jes ' decided it 's fine . ( Takes the flowers . ) HIRAM Could I set down at the table ? ( Pulls out chair . ) BIRDIE MAE ( Considers this seriously . ) I do n't think it 's time yit . Mebbe next time . HIRAM ( Leans awkwardly on chair . ) Could I come round tomorra ? BIRDIE MAE I guess I could find the time . ( She carefully arranges the flowers in a glass . ) HIRAM ( Watches her a moment in silence . ) You ever bin to school ? BIRDIE MAE Nope . People round here do n't like to see girls readin ' an ' writin ' . HIRAM I do n't neither . A girl 's got a lotta work growin ' into a woman , learnin ' cookin ' an ' cleanin ' an ' alla them ladylike arts . BIRDIE MAE That 's what my daddy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's been mocking him . ) So where 'd you learn yer numbers ? BIRDIE MAE From my brother Lester . He went to the school pretty steady the whole year , an ' nights he 'd say his numbers over an ' over . HIRAM Well , that 's all right , then . BIRDIE MAE Sure was a pretty sound . HIRAM I 'd like to meet yer mother an ' father . BIRDIE MAE You kin meet my mama tomorra , but you cai n't meet my daddy till yer real serious . ( Beat . ) Mebbe in a week . ( They stand looking at each other as lights fade on center stage . BIRDIE MAE crosses to her rocker . ) BIRDIE MAE My mama an'daddy liked Hiram , ' cause he was educated an ' spoke real good . ( Begins to put on her shoes . ) I liked him too , though I could n't never understand him hardly . But it did n't matter none then . I was wantin ' to git outta the house an ' have some room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NEVA My mother , Miss Birdie Mae Coleman , was raised on a large plantation in Paradise . Her father bred horses , and he taught all his children to ride well . My mother was an excellent rider . She was also very beautiful , tall , slender , with dark hair and large , blue eyes . She was a strong woman , with definite opinions , although she had little opportunity for education . She was only seventeen when she met my father . He was a traveling schoolteacher , and one dusky summer evening he saw Birdie Mae , my mother , ride by on her silvery grey horse . She was laughing and her hair was flying . That evening my father could n't sleep . Next day he found out who my mother was and began courting her . She fell in love with him immediately : he was several years older and so handsome and genteel . They were married six months later , moved into a small but lovely old house near her father 's plantation , and within a year Birdie Mae @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 11 BIRDIE MAE ( As HIRAM is moving boxcar panels in place . ) At first we moved into a railroad car near one a them minin ' camps an ' Hiram got hisself a job in a one-room country school . I guess Hiram worried I might learn to read , but I fooled him . I started havin ' kids right away . ( Gets up and comes down as lights come up on center stage . She acts out the following monologue . ) BIRDIE MAE ( cont 'd ) I remember when the first chile come , I was walkin ' round with the pains , an ' Hiram run out to fetch Miz Maddy with the bornin ' . Seems like they was a long time , an ' when they come in the door , I was squattin ' , hangin ' onto a chair , an ' screamin ' like a hound that 's caught its leg in a trap . An ' that chile was right on its way out . Well , Hiram did n't faint er nothin ' ; he jes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' put me to bed . Next day when he come home from teachin ( She busies herself with supper preparations . HIRAM enters , walking baby NEVA around , and as he walks , he talks to her . ) HIRAM Hush up , little one , little Neva chile . You ai n't got no cause fer fussin ' . Yer mama 's here , an ' she ai n't leavin ' . An ' yer daddy 's here . Do n't you like yer daddy , little Neva ? BIRDIE MAE Try bouncin ' ' er some , Hiram . Mebbe it 'll calm ' er. p. 12 HIRAM ( Bouncing baby gently as he walks and throwing proud glances at BIRDIE MAE . He speaks loudly enough for BIRDIE MAE to hear him . ) You goin ' to grow up an ' be jes ' like yer ma . Sweet an ' pretty like yer ma . You goin ' to mind me when I tells you to do somethin ' , jes ' like yer ma does . ( To BIRDIE MAE . ) Ai @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Busy with supper . ) That 's right , Hiram . Supper 's near ready . HIRAM ( Takes baby NEVA aside , down right , and speaks softly to her ; this is meant for NEVA alone . ) Yer mine , jes ' like yer ma . You two all I got in this world . I ai n't never had nobody belong to me before . I 'm gon na make yer life so happy , yers an ' yer ma 's . I 'm gon na work real hard fer both a you . BIRDIE MAE Set yerself down an ' eat , Hiram . I 'll take the chile . HIRAM ( Comes to BIRDIE MAE and hands her the baby . ) She goin ' to be jes ' like you , Birdie Mae . BIRDIE MAE ( Taking baby as their eyes meet in a loving look . ) That 'll be real nice , Hiram . ( Lights fade as BIRDIE MAE crosses to her rocker . ) How he loved that chile , she bein ' his first . An ' he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pitcher of jes ' how she was goin ' to be . ( Sighs . ) Well . ( Beat . ) Hiram helped round home ever ' time he could . When I had that second chile , an ' he were n't home , I did n't have no time to fetch help . So I did all my own private screamin ' an ' bornin ' an ' cleanin ' up ' fore he ever knew about it . ( Sits on bench down left. ) p. 13 NEVA Birdie Mae was a magnificent mother . She gave birth with ease and raised her children simply and naturally . And my father was a great support to her . How he appreciated her beautiful meals and the sparkling cleanliness of her house ! Mother raised her own chickens ; I remember seeing her swing a chicken round and round until its neck was broken . And then she would give it to Miz Maddy , our Negro help , who would clean it and cook fried chicken and mashed potatoes for supper . After dinner I would climb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . BIRDIE MAE I bin ' settin ' her thinkin ' ' bout how alla them kids leaned on me , thinkin ' I was strong . An ' Hiram too , he leaned on me , an ' I did n't never feel real strong . But there 's somethin ' ' bout bein ' a mother , do n't matter how ol ' you are , people jes ' wan na crawl right onto yer lap an ' have you hold ' em . An ' do n't matter if you never boiled a egg , soon as yer a mother , you got ta make biscuits an ' fried chicken an ' pie . ( Acts out the following monologue . ) When my first chile come , I 'd never in alla my fifteen years swung a chicken round an ' round till its neck was broke . I 'd watched my mama do it , so I knew what to do . I took holt a that chicken an ' started in swingin ' . I swung an ' swung till my arm near to fell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't break.All a them chickens started in to squawkin ' like they was tryin ' to bring the night on early . Well , I felt such a fool , an ' my arm was bleedin ' from mad chicken scratches . But it was me er the chicken jes ' then , so I run on over to a big ol ' tree an ' started in smashin ' that chicken into the trunk till I broke ever ' bone in its body . Now Neva , the baby , was yellin ' so hard she started in chokin ' . I threw that bloody chicken against the side a the house an ' went runnin ' to pick up my baby . I got blood all over ' er , a course . What a mess ! The sun was near settin ' , so I knew Hiram 'd be home . I quick washed off Neva an ' the battered ol ' chicken , stoked up the fire , an ' threw the chicken in the oven . When Hiram come home , he said he smelt somethin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cooked that damn ol ' chicken with all its feathers on . ( Sighs . Crosses to rocker. ) p. 14 BIRDIE MAE ( cont 'd ) Well , it 's jes ' like Hiram said , the Lord do n't care fer pretense . When you do somethin ' wrong , ai n't no way to hide it . NEVA Mother would often put me in charge of the other children since I was the eldest . And here is an amazing truth : I never , in all those years , had even the slightest quarrel with my brothers and sisters , which must be why they trusted me so . ( Faint Christmas music is heard . Early morning light up slowly center stage . NEVA , about ten years old , creeps in on tiptoe , looks around and sees two dolls sitting on table . She goes to them , inspects them , chooses one and takes it down right center , by bed , where she sits , holding , touching and rocking doll in delight . SAL HENRY , about seven years old , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hell , ever ' damn Christmas ! ( Looks around , sees NEVA with her doll . To NEVA . ) You done it again ! NEVA You shoulda got up earlier .

( Goes to NEVA . ) Lemme see yers. p. 15 NEVA No , I ai n't showin ' . ( SAL HENRY looks threatening . ) Oh , all right . ( Holds up doll . ) SAL HENRY China ! NEVA ( Puts doll away , holds it protectively . ) That 's all . SAL HENRY Lemme see again . ( NEVA turns away . ) You got a china head doll ! A china head ! NEVA Well , I 'm older .

NEVA She 's real tired . It 's bin a hard winter . SAL HENRY You kin touch mine . NEVA I 'm busy takin ' care a Emmaline . SAL HENRY Emmaline ? That 's a dumb name . NEVA It 's a lady 's name . This here doll 's a lady . She 's her daddy 's girl . She got on lace drawers an ' silk shoes . ( This is too much for SAL HENRY . She swings her doll and hits NEVA on the head with it. ) p. 16 NEVA Oh ! SAL HENRY Damn china head doll ! ( Cradles her doll in her arms and walks away . ) We do n't care , do we , Sam ? NEVA Sam ? SAL HENRY Yeah , this here doll 's Sam , an ' she 's real tough . ( Addressing her doll . ) I 'm gon na teach you to climb trees , Sam , an ' throw rocks over the river . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better'n me . NEVA Emmaline got blue eyes with long lashes . An ' they open an ' shut . ( SAL HENRY is stunned . Sensing her triumph , NEVA ca n't stop . ) Bet yer doll 's eyes do n't open an ' shut . SAL HENRY ( Turns with a roar and flies across the stage to NEVA . ) Git ' em , Sam ! ( Leaps on NEVA , grabs her china doll , and runs out door with both dolls . ) NEVA Ma ! BIRDIE MAE ( Enters sleepily in nightgown . ) What 's goin ' on here ? NEVA ( Runs to BIRDIE MAE , and tackles her around the waist . ) Sal Henry took my doll , Ma , an ' she run off ! BIRDIE MAE Why 'd she do that ? p. 17 NEVA My doll was prettier ! But I got up first ! BIRDIE MAE All right , honey . We 'll git yer doll back . Do n't fret . NEVA She 's gon na hurt ' er , Ma . An ' I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) I never had such a pretty doll ! BIRDIE MAE We shoulda got two a them china head dolls , but we did n't hardly have no money . An ' I made the rag ' un myself . NEVA She do n't want no rag doll , Ma . She wants mine ! BIRDIE MAE All right . You jes ' set right there , an ' I 'll go git yer doll back . ( Exits through door . ) NEVA ( Sits , stares out over audience , rocking tragically . ) You take care a yerself , Emmaline . Jes ' remember yer a lady . Do n't let nobody hurt you . BIRDIE MAE ( Returns after a few moments dragging SAL HENRY , who is shamefaced but triumphant . ) Now ! Give ' er the doll ! SAL HENRY Oh , take ' er .

BIRDIE MAE ( cont 'd ) ( To SAL HENRY . ) What 'd you do to ' er eyes ? SAL HENRY I dug ' em out with a ice pick . ( BIRDIE MAE slaps SAL HENRY onto bed . Immediately NEVA leaps on SAL HENRY , and the two girls fall to the floor fighting . Lights dim out on center as BIRDIE MAE returns to rocker . ) BIRDIE MAE Them kids . They were mighty troublesome . An ' I kept on havin ' others ' fore the first ones was even growed up . ( Gleefully assumes an air of injured innocence which is not meant to deceive us . ) Which were n't altogether my fault . Here Hiram was all day teachin ' folks readin ' an ' writin ' , an ' he 'd come home tired an ' wan na rassle . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Another kid would come poppin ' out . Well , purty soon I seen what was the problem . It was that damn rasslin ' . So I says to Hiram , " Hey , quit that , ' cause I got a whole lotta kids already , an ' I cai n't handle ' em . " So he laid off fer awhile , an ' we took up religion . p. 19 NEVA ( Back in her chair on platform . ) My mother and father were upright , God-fearing people , and although that was a quality I resented as an adolescent , since the church dominated much of our lives , I am sure it gave them a peace and a closeness which was apparent to all of us . BIRDIE MAE We was livin ' in one a them places with a jumpin ' gospel church . I could hear it all the way down the road . One day I snuck over there , an ' I got the speerit .

( Proudly . ) An ' speakin ' in tongues ! p. 20 HIRAM ( Transfixed by his inner visions . ) It was the power of the Holy Speerit . I felt it runnin ' through my whole body .

It was one a them soft nights , kinda early grey evenin ' . A pale , yalla moon was meltin ' over the hills , an ' the trees was rustlin ' in a easy way . I had n't bin gittin ' ' long real well with Hiram that night , so I was upset , you might say . I set down on a big ol ' rock a ' got myself quiet.All a sudden I heard a sorta singin ' . But it were n't like people singin ' ; it seemed like angels . An ' they did n't use no words , jes ' beautiful music like hummin ' , shiftin ' round ' , goin ' way up an ' way down . An ' I thought maybe it were n't really so , it were all in my mind , so I got myself up an ' walked on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I went .

( Returns to rocker . ) An ' I never did tell nobody , ' cause I knew that singin ' was jes ' fer me , tellin ' me things was all right . NEVA ( Back at her desk , writing . ) Every evening , after supper , Father would read to us from the Bible . His deep , sonorous voice enchanted us , although it would often put us to sleep . We would waken slightly when we were carried in to bed , and then we would hear the murmur of Mother and Father 's voices carrying us out to sleep again on waves of darkness . p. 31 BIRDIE MAE I had four kids by then . Neva , my oldest , was smart , pretty an ' tough . She could boss them kids around an ' make ' em cry real fast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nice , an ' ever'body liked him .

He 'd set in a tree readin ' the gospel fer hours . An ' Sal Henry . She shoulda bin a boy . She could run faster an ' hit harder an ' spit further than anybody . She was allus in trouble . NEVA Mother always dressed us beautifully . I remember a white lace dress I had as a child , a lovely dress with pink satin ribbons that took Mother many hours to make . And a little pair of dancing shoes . My father brought us books , many books , which were a delight to my brother Percy and me . BIRDIE MAE Neva were n't never satisfied . She kept askin ' fer fancy clothes an ' a pair a real shoes . But we did n't have no money , an ' I did n't sew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ books , she an ' Percy . Now , I tole ' em the Lord do n't take no stock in dressin ' up an ' readin ' books what the Lord had n't wrote . But I started in feelin ' a touch unhappy myself . I found myself lookin ' round that ol ' railroad car an ' wantin ' some curtains an ' a piece a carpet an ' a icebox a my own . An ' a real house to put ' em in .

BIRDIE MAE You remember Miz Lula Ann Jessup lives up the road ? HIRAM No , ' fraid I do n't . BIRDIE MAE She 's that nice , yalla-haired lady always prays an ' jumps real well at the meetin 's . Kinda got a style to ' er . HIRAM ( His attention caught . ) Oh , I know ' er . She 's real fancy , but ai n't no doubt she knows the Lord . BIRDIE MAE Well , ever ' once in a whiles I go visit Miz Lula Ann , an ' , you know , she got a real house . HIRAM Ai n't we got a real house ? p. 33 BIRDIE MAE Oh , this ol ' railroad car ai n't a real house . ( Sits , leans toward him . ) Miz Lula Ann got a house with rooms an ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not satisfied with what he 's done for her . ) Mother ! BIRDIE MAE An ' the windas got curtains , with little pink flowers in ' em . An ' she got a couple a pieces a carpet which got no holes in ' em , an ' ( This is the real whammy . ) She got a icebox ! HIRAM Mother , the Lord Jesus says be happy with what you got . BIRDIE MAE I bin happy , Father , but HIRAM Mother , have I bin a good husband ? BIRDIE MAE Yes , but HIRAM An ' have I pervided you an ' them kids with a roof over yer heads an ' food in yer mouths ? BIRDIE MAE Yes , but HIRAM Well , do n't go talkin ' no trash ' bout windas an ' curtains ! We jes ' as cozy an ' happy as we can be . BIRDIE MAE But I ai n't happy . HIRAM Mother , you got nothin ' to do but take care a them kids , an ' I work hard ever ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bin workin ' in the fields a the Lord . p. 34 BIRDIE MAE Well , I bin workin ' real hard , too ! We got four kids gittin ' bigger an ' bigger in this little ol ' railroad car , an ' they 're fightin ' an ' eatin ' an ' tearin ' things up . HIRAM Ai n't nothin ' I kin do about that . Yer their mother , an ' that 's what yer s'posed to do . BIRDIE MAE But this place is too small fer us . Ai n't no room fer them kids to run around . HIRAM ( This is the real point . ) I do n't make enough money teachin ' to git us a real house . BIRDIE MAE ( She gets up , pours more coffee . Pause . ) I bin thinkin ' ' bout light , light comin ' in through real windas . I remember that kinda light comin ' in to our house when I was a little ' un . HIRAM When you married me , you knew a rich man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curtains er thick , soft carpet . Jes ' a house where we could have a room a our own , mebbe one with a door to it . HIRAM I cai n't see no way clear to it . BIRDIE MAE You bin gittin ' awful tired teachin ' in that little ol ' school , gittin ' home late ever ' night . Mebbe if we moved into town you could find yerself a job in a bigger school , where you would n't have to take care a ever'thin ' . p. 35 HIRAM Well BIRDIE MAE ( Comes around behind him and embraces him . ) An ' we 'd have more time nights to set up an ' talk with the evenin ' light comin ' in nice an ' soft HIRAM It 'd be nice , ai n't no doubt . BIRDIE MAE Jes ' go an ' look is all I 'm askin ' . ( Long pause . ) Hiram ? ( Silence . BIRDIE MAE runs her hands through his hair . ) Hiram , what er you thinkin ' ? HIRAM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he embraces her . ) All right , Birdie Mae . I 'll go an ' look . Lights slowly down center stage as BIRDIE MAE moves down left to bench and HIRAM removes boxcar panels . ) BIRDIE MAE An ' he did , too , found hisself a couple a jobs in town , day teachin ' in a school an ' night watchin ' in a icebox factory . We got us a ol ' farmhouse on the edge a town . Now , it were n't no elegant place , bein ' whistlin ' drafty in winter an ' runnin ' on to mud when the rains come , but it sure did have rooms with doors to ' em , an ' real glass windas . There was a ol ' piano which folks had left behind , an ' on rainy evenin 's the kids would bang along on it , makin ' their own thunder . One night ( Smiles broadly . ) Hiram come home with a big surprise : a icebox ! Which I did n't even ask fer . p. 36 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was eleven , my family moved into a lovely old house in town . It was the former mayor 's home : white , with leaded windows and tiny balconies overlooking the street . Our parlor was dominated by a baby grand piano . I practised every day , trying to make that piano sing with the beauty of Bach and Mozart . Father had become principal of the school in town , and he also worked as assistant editor of our local paper . Mother , who was determined to have a large family , had three more children . I remember her singing softly as she carried sleeping babies back and forth past the lace curtains dancing in the twilight breezes . BIRDIE MAE That farmhouse were n't near that ol ' gospel church , so evenin 's when Hiram could n't jump at the meetin 's no more , he started gittin ' restless . An ' dang if he did n't start in rasslin ' with me again . Now , I 'd bin missin ' that rasslin ' , ai n't no doubt , but my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Hiram , " I 'd say , " what 're we gon na do ? We got us a big family now . " " Do n't bother yer pretty head , " he 'd say . An ' I tried not to , though I knew I was right . An ' sure enough , ' long come three more a them kids.First there was Ben , a cute little thing , did n't bother me much . An ' then Inman , who was a real mean little heller , worse'n Sal Henry . Inman was the kinda kid give you five dollars if he had it , an ' poison chickens jes ' to watch ' em die . An ' Alvira was the last : scrunched-up an ' skinny an ' allus whinin ' that she had to wear Neva an ' Sal Henry 's ol ' dresses which was too big fer her . Inman pretty much made me crazy beatin ' up on Alvira . She 'd drag herself in the house all dirty an ' cryin ' , an ' Inman 'd be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Alvira was allus findin ' a ailment in ' erself too . I guess she jes ' wanted some extra lovin ' , bein ' the little'un . But I was tired myself by then , and I 'd have to worry about Neva , who was in the high school . ( Lights up center . Both NEVA and BIRDIE MAE walk into the scene .

We ai n't never bin ashamed a it . p. 38 NEVA But we 're living in town now . People do n't raise their own chickens and bake all their own bread .

Teachers think I could get a scholarship . HIRAM Besides , yer ma an ' I want you here at home . NEVA But I ca n't stay home all my life ! I 've got to leave Paradise sometime . HIRAM Not yit . NEVA Do you think Paradise , Kentucky , is the whole world ? Is that what you think ? p. 54 BIRDIE MAE Honey , do n't argue with yer daddy . NEVA Every time we talk , we have this argument .

NEVA ( Softly . ) Yes , Daddy . I have to . ( As lights dim , NEVA walks slowly to her chair and settles herself with her diary. ) p. 57 NEVA My father was proud of my intelligence and my desire for education . And , of course , my mother supported me in my college plans . In those days it would have been impossible for a woman to go to a university without her parents ' help and approval . My father worked himself near to death to put me through school , so I was able to go to Northwestern University and study English literature . ( Puts down diary and exits . ) BIRDIE MAE Neva sure did have trouble with ' er daddy . He never did want ' er to grow up . ( Sighs . ) But he an ' Neva worked somethin ' out .

BIRDIE MAE Yes , Hiram . ( Pause . ) Wonder when Neva 's comin ' . ( Pause . ) I said , I wonder when Neva 's comin ' . ( Pause . ) She 's kinda late .

( Quickly . ) But to someone I choose , not to someone you pick out for me. p. 95 BIRDIE MAE ( This goes right on by her . ) Praise the Lord ! NEVA And he 's going to take me away from here . BIRDIE MAE Our baby 's gittin ' married , Hiram . HIRAM Fine , Neva . BIRDIE MAE Who you marryin ' , honey ? NEVA A young man I met at the college . We fell in love , but we needed time to think about it . I came back here to teach and save money , while Aaron finished his senior year . BIRDIE MAE An ' you never tole me ! NEVA Two weeks ago he wrote and asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have decided to accept . BIRDIE MAE What 's his name ? NEVA Aaron Greenberg . BIRDIE MAE Greenberg ? Do n't know no Greenbergs round here .

HIRAM Poetry ? p. 96 BIRDIE MAE You useta like poetry , Hiram . Why , I remember when you come courtin ' HIRAM What kinda name 's Greenberg ? NEVA Jewish , Daddy . ( An awful silence . Then BIRDIE MAE , who senses the tension but does n't know what it 's about , breaks in . ) BIRDIE MAE Jewish ? What 's that , honey ? NEVA It 's a religion , Ma . BIRDIE MAE Well , that 's fine , baby . Long 's them Jewish believe in our Lord Jesus Christ . HIRAM ( A black volcano . ) They do n't , Birdie Mae . I read about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in our Lord Jesus is the Son a God . BIRDIE MAE Oh , they prob'ly do , Hiram . HIRAM You cai n't marry a man that do n't believe in Jesus . NEVA I love him , Daddy . HIRAM You find yerself a Baptist to love . I 'd even go ' long with a Methodist . But not a Jewish . BIRDIE MAE Mebbe he 's real nice an ' kind , like Neva says . HIRAM Only thing can hold a marriage together is the love a Jesus . p. 97 BIRDIE MAE They 's other things holds our marriage , Hiram . Like the kids , an ' workin ' round the house , an ( Hesitates. ) our private lovin ' . ( Strongly . ) Which is different than the love a Jesus ! HIRAM Birdie Mae ! NEVA Do n't you yell at Ma !

HIRAM ( Slaps her . ) Do n't never talk like that ! NEVA I want you to know something , Daddy . All these years I 've been sneaking out , going to dances and playing cards , and you never knew ! And it did n't hurt me at all ! I 'm a fine , intelligent woman , better educated than you . And unlike you , I 'm going to be a success in this lifetime , because that 's where it counts . Here , on the earth . Not waiting for some reward in Heaven ! HIRAM You 'll go to Hell . NEVA You 're losing me , Daddy . BIRDIE MAE I 'd feel a ease in my heart knowin ' she was marryin ' a man she loves . p. 98 HIRAM Not a Jewish man . BIRDIE MAE The Lord knows if a man is good , an ' mebbe that man do n't have to say right out he believes in Jesus fer the Lord to understand . HIRAM Neva , if you marry that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MAE ( Drawing away from him , straightening her spine . ) Well HIRAM I do n't want to see you no more .

( Goes to NEVA and puts her arm around her . ) NEVA Oh , Ma HIRAM ( Surprised . ) Now , wait BIRDIE MAE ( Drawing her downstage . Confidentially . ) An ' you bring that young man round , you hear ? NEVA ( Tears in her eyes . ) All right , Ma . BIRDIE MAE We got ta stick together , is all . ( They hug . BIRDIE MAE then turns and reaches out to HIRAM , but he remains frozen in bewilderment that comes from an incipient understanding of his loss . BIRDIE MAE crosses down left to bench . She freezes as lights dim . As NEVA speaks , BIRDIE MAE stares ahead , not hearing. ) p. 99 NEVA You see , Ma , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too . ( Crosses to BIRDIE MAE . ) But I wanted us to be ACCEPTABLE , Ma . And we were n't . I wanted us to be middle class . Educated . I was n't ever going to be laughed at again . Did you know I was laughed at , Ma ? ( Touches BIRDIE MAE 's shoulder . ) First for my poverty , then for my accent when I went to college . Oh , yes , we all had accents , Ma , but I sounded like poor country folk . Which we were . My words were different . And if I had n't been so goddamned beautiful , Ma , and so smart , I never would have been accepted . ( Turns and walks away a few steps . ) And still it was n't easy . When I married Aaron , I said it made no difference that he was Jewish . But it did , Ma .

An ' I smell honeysuckle driftin' ' ' long in moonlight . It 's one a them big , round moons , real yalla . My hair is like silk , an ' I feel it on my shoulders . An ' then I realize I ai n't got no clothes on , an ' I 'm standin ' on a barn roof . Ai n't nobody round to see me , but I 'm feelin ' so nice , I would n't care anyways . I move round a little , careful not to fall off . But then I know I ca n't fall . So I start in dancin'an ' dancin ' , an ' I 'm gittin ' prettier an ' prettier , my body round like a young girl , an'my cheeks rosy , even in the night.An ' then I see Hiram a ways off . At first I do n't want to call him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But then I says in the dream , What the Hell . Which I would n't normally say , an ' I calls : " Hey , Hiram . Come dance with me on this soft , summer night ! " But he do n't answer . An ' somehow I know he 's heard me , but he do n't want me dancin ' , even on a roof in a dream.So I says , in a laughin ' an ' singin ' way : " Well , Hiram , I stayed with you all these years , but now my feet is jes ' carryin ' me away . " An ' even as I says it , my feet start risin ' off a the roof , an ' I 'm dancin ' up to the moon . An ' I see Hiram git littler an ' littler . I pass right on up into some clouds , an ' I never see him no more .

NEVA ( cont 'd ) ( Takes combs from her own hair , puts them in BIRDIE MAE 's . ) I said Daddy was educated . I know you think he was , and I suppose compared to you he seemed so , but he was n't really , Ma . ( Adjusts her mother 's dress . ) Oh , the world is not an easy place ; you have to fight to live in it . And it was n't pure invention , just exaggeration ( Tilts her mother 's head to a more elegant angle. ) a little distortion here and there . But I always loved you . ( As she speaks this last line , she passes her hand over BIRDIE MAE 's face , closing her mother 's eyes . ) I will never mention this again , Ma . I will tell our story the way it should have been , the way it is . I will set you free . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elegant . A pause . Then NEVA 's voice becomes shy and girlish . As she tells the following dream , BIRDIE MAE unfreezes herself , removes the shawl , lets down her hair . She acts out the dream as NEVA tells it , perhaps even whispering , in a kind of antiphonal chant , some of NEVA 's phrases. ) p. 101 NEVA There 's something I 've been wanting to tell you , Ma . A dream I keep having , and it 's so strange . You see , in this dream I 'm all alone on a summer 's night , and there are little breezes blowing around me . I hear crickets and smell honeysuckle drifting in the moonlight . My hair is silky , and I feel it on my shoulders . And then ( Laughs apologetically . ) I realize I 'm naked and standing on a barn roof . Well , there 's no one around to see me , but I feel so lovely I would n't care anyway . I move around a little , but I 'm very careful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I see you , Ma , dancing in the clouds . ( Becoming ecstatic . ) You look so beautiful , Ma . I I call : Ma ! But you do n't seem to hear me , so I reach up to you , and I I force myself to rise up , up to where you 're having such a good time , be cause I want to dance with you , but ( Her voice becomes whining , tearfully despairing , as though she can not comprehend this at all. ) before I can get there , I always wake up .
