" All of us today are just learning democracy . We are only now forming a political culture . " <P>  --  Mikhail Gorbachev at the Congress of People 's Deputies <P> From the opening moment , when the spotlights flicked on to illuminate a towering statue of Lenin , it was clear that the days of fully scripted , party- orchestrated politics had  --  at least for a moment  --  come to an end . Assembled in the Kremlin 's Palace of Congresses were the delegates to the Soviet Union 's brand-new Congress of People 's Deputies , a forum where doctrine could be questioned , where the unexpected could happen , and where the unmentionable could be spoken for all the nation to hear . <P> All of which came to pass , over three days of debate . The 2,250-seat Congress , two-thirds of whose delegates were freely elected , constitutes what is arguably the most democratic governmental institution in more than seven decades of Soviet rule . But the assembly also revealed a profound regard for the status quo in carrying out one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Supreme Soviet , which will serve as the country 's working legislature . In voting results announced Saturday , most anti-establishment candidates , some of whom had defeated high-ranking Communist Party members to reach the Congress , lost their bids to be seated in the Supreme Soviet . The rebuffed reformers included Boris Yeltsin , the former Moscow party chief who resigned his post in the Construction Ministry earlier in the week , partly in anticipation of being elected to the Supreme Soviet . Only in delegations from Moscow and the Baltic region , a seedbed of reform , did a handful of reformers gain election to the permanent legislature . The results were a severe blow to advocates of change , who seldom attracted more than a third of the body 's delegates in major votes . <P> Any suspicion that the Congress would turn into a totally rubber-stamp legislature , however , was dispelled minutes into the opening session , when a Latvian delegate strode uninvited to the podium . " I ask you to honor the memory of those who died in Tbilisi , " urged the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Georgian capital in April , some reportedly with poison gas , during clashes with army troops . That request , which prompted the delegates to rise for a moment of silence , was not merely unrehearsed , it was an explicit act of defiance that went against Gorbachev 's wish that no ethnic group be singled out for sympathy .
