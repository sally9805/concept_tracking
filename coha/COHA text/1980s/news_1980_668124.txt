Two of the more highly paid blacks in the Boston School Department have resigned in what other black school officials have suggested privately may turn into a substantial exodus of minority administrators . Personnel director Clarence Cooper , who is paid about $33,000 a year , said yesterday he has resigned effective Nov. 7 . He said his decision was based on " a multitude of reasons " that included the firing in August of former superintendent Robert Wood and the administrative shake-up recommended last week by Acting Supt. Paul A. Kennedy . He added , however , that he had begun planning to leave before either of those events . Also resigning is Juan Evereteze , assistant personnel manager in charge of minority recruitment , who worked his last day in the School Department yesterday . Evereteze , whose salary could not be confirmed last night but is believed to be about $26,000 a year , could not be reached for comment on his reasons for leaving . Kennedy noted in an interview that both Cooper and Evereteze had been planning to leave for some time and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are no longer welcome in the School Department . Unlike Cooper , who is in the last stages of negotiating for a job " with a couple of organizations in the private sector , " Evereteze already has employment lined up . Acquaintances said he will begin working for Wang Laboratories in two weeks in its personnel department . Two or three other blacks are close to resigning , sources said yesterday , and others are said to be considering new jobs . " I suspect there ' ll be more people resigning their positions , particularly if Tuesday ' s vote ( on reorganization ) goes through , " a black administrator who is not leaving , at least not immediately , said yesterday . The School Committee is scheduled to meet Tuesday on Kennedy ' s Oct. 2 personnel and reorganization recommendations , as well as other matters . The meeting will follow the swearing in of Kevin McCluskey to the five-member committee . He will take the seat vacated last week by Gerald O ' Leary . O ' Leary resigned after he was arrested on a charge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was awarded a contract with the school system last July . " I feel they have no reason to be concerned , " Kennedy said of the department ' s black administrators , whose number last year reached the 20 percent representation ordered by the US District Court . " I think my nominations show that I made 13 nominations the other day and six of them are black , " Kennedy said . Blacks who have criticized Kennedy ' s reorganization plan , including School Committee member John D. O ' Bryant and two state representatives , have suggested the jobs Kennedy wants to fill with blacks will give them less influence than some of the positions blacks held under Wood . " I don ' t believe that at all , " replied Kennedy . " Peterkin will be higher than either one of the deputies in his salary with citywide responsibilities . . . . He will report directly to me and certainly has a significant policy- making role . " Robert Peterkin , a 35-year-old black man who has served as headmaster of English High School and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nominated by Kennedy to be the $42,500-a-year director of the city ' s new Occupational Resource Center , with citywide responsibilities for vocational education . " He ' s isolated , " one of the blacks critical of Kennedy ' s plan said recently of the ORC director ' s job . " Whether they call it a director or whatever , he is a principal of a school .
