With roles for black actresses scarce , they pooled talents and backgrounds to write and star in Stepping into Tomorrow , a play they have been performing on the road for school and civic groups for the past three years . Although Tomorrow draws mostly on the problems of today 's teenagers , their next collaborative effort may prove more political . To be called Part of One Mind , the new play , says King , " will be about the similarities that existed between our fathers .

With hot designs on toothsome Susan , Deneuve commits the classic faux pas of asking about a blood transfusion . " Not the greatest move on a first date , " observes Sarandon . Indeed , but such is the foam that washes ashore in this bit of vampyorrhea that aggressively bills itself as " new wave . " Quick , somebody fetch the stake . <P> <P> With the Hollywood recycling mill humming at full capacity , actresses combing through the bios of studio film stars for a juicy part are as thick as autumn leaves-and some even thicker . And so with her Wonder Woman tights permanently stored away in some back-lot prop warehouse , Television Actress Lynda Carter dons a red wig and sucks in her tummy for Rita Hayworth , the Love Goddess , an upcoming two-hour CBS television movie .
