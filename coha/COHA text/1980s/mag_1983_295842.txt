Save for the celluloid immortality enjoyed by a few of the residents here , they are all , of course , as defenseless against decline as any other aged flesh and mind : the tolerance is gone for noise , harsh light , the unexpected ; a sidewalk curb is no more easily managed than an escarpment . But it is different in here . There is n't , for example , the palpable sadness that is so striking in other institutions where people are growing very old . It is n't happy all the time , exactly , but neither is the air so thick with loneliness , to say nothing of futility . <P> The name of the place is the Motion Picture and Television Country House and Hospital , and it is where many film and TV people who do n't get filthy rich wind up ; carpenters , grips , security men , sound technicians and other behind-the-scenes retirees outnumber the luminaries , but the list of recognizable retirees is not as brief as one might expect , given the salaries in the business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Donald Crisp died here . Norma Shearer is here . Eddie ( " Rochester " ) Anderson died here . Regis Toomey is here . Ellen Corby , the grandmother on The Waltons , just moved in . Stepin Fetchit is here . Bruce Cabot , Chester Conklin , Larry Fine ( one of the Three Stooges ) , Edmund Lowe , Arthur O'Connell , Herbert Marshall and Mitchell Leisen ( a director whose credits included Death Takes a Holiday ) died here . <P> Chill Wills would have died of cancer here , but he said he wanted to go home when the end was very near ; he barely beat the clock with the help of a limousine . At his house , he told his wife when they laid him down , " I 'm never going to leave this bed again . " Johnny Weissmuller was here , but lucidity began to elude him in the darkest hours , and he took to wandering into other rooms , booming that famous Tarzan yell , and they had to take him away . The ape man is now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his bills are seen to by the Motion Picture and Television Fund . The fund also administers the Country House and Hospital , which is not equipped to accommodate any behavioral explosion since one of the principal missions here is to becalm . <P> The fund has been around under one name or another since 1921 , and it is enormously well off , primarily as a result of extraordinary expressions of philanthropy . Its motto is " We take care of our own . " Recent bequests from the Samuel Goldwyn estate alone approach $35 million . George Burns just gave the fund a supermarket , and the fund sold it for $600,000 . The big gifts and an industrywide payroll deduction plan that now brings in about $2 million a year have accumulated to present assets of $80 million , including the 47 acres in the Los Angeles suburb of Woodland Hills , where the Country House and Hospital stands . The budget is $14 million a year and rising . The director of fund raising is William Campbell , whose name may not ring a bell , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these people get from their unions , pensions , Social Security , whatever , " Campbell was explaining in his office one day , " you could fit in your nostril . " Superstars aside , he said , " think of the actor with 30 years of experience , average it out to $12,000 a year earnings , and you come up with retirement benefits of $400 a month . Who could live on it ? "
