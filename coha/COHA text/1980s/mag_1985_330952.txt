DIED . Yul Brynner , 65 , exotic , prepotent actor whose near total identification with the role of the dictatorial but endearing King of Siam , whom he portrayed in 4,625 performances of The King and I over 34 years as well as in the 1956 film , and for which he won a Tony Award and an Oscar , almost obscured his achievements as a movie performer , photographer and TV director ; after a two- year battle with cancer ; in New York City . He was born Taidje Khan on Sakhalin Island , off the coast of Siberia , to a Rumanian Gypsy mother and a Swiss-Mongolian father . Reared in Peking and Paris , he was a cabaret singer and circus acrobat before becoming an actor , arriving in the U.S. in 1941 and making his Broadway debut in the 1946 Lute Song . He brought his bald-pated , brooding persona to three dozen films , most notably The Ten Commandments ( 1956 ) , The Brothers Karamazov ( 1958 ) and The Magnificent Seven ( 1960 ) .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
