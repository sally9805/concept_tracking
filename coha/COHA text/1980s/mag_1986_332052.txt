Smiling and affable , Mikhail Gorbachev arrived in East Germany last week . Emerging from his Aeroflot IL-62 jet , the Soviet leader , followed by his wife Raisa , flashed his friendliest grin as he greeted East German Party Chief Erich Honecker with a hug and kisses on both cheeks . Gorbachev had come to East Berlin for the East German Communist Party Congress . <P> The message that Gorbachev brought with him , though , was not really one of smiles and kisses . His visit was aimed at quietly strengthening Moscow 's hold on its Warsaw Pact allies . From Poland to Hungary , Eastern Europe is being summoned to join a Soviet-led drive to prevent the bloc 's economies from falling even more hopelessly behind those of the West . In a 40-minute speech to the 2,600 delegates in East Berlin 's modernistic Palace of the Republic , Gorbachev called on his allies to meet the challenge of swift economic and technological change by moving toward close and intense cooperation " on a whole new order of magnitude . " Said he : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will depend , to a decisive degree , on this . " <P> During the long twilight of Leonid Brezhnev 's era and the infirm leadership in the Kremlin that followed , Eastern Europe was granted an unprecedented degree of latitude . Each country reacted differently to the chance to take some independent action . Hungary , for example , introduced many Western-style incentives for workers and managers . Czechoslovakia stagnated , though , and Poland lurched toward freedom until Moscow ordered a crackdown . <P> Gorbachev is now moving gradually , but determinedly , to bring his allies into line and push them toward better economic management . He chose East Germany 's eleventh party congress as a platform in tribute to the front-line country whose economy , by Soviet standards , is a model of efficiency . <P> But despite all the public camaraderie , an undercurrent of tension reportedly has run between Gorbachev and Honecker . Noted one leading West German expert on East bloc affairs : " There is no love lost these days between the East Germans and the Soviets . " Once considered among the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ according to another West German observer , " now wants to be accepted as the leader of an important national state , not a provisional one , or a colony of the Russians . One wonders how long Honecker can get away with this policy . Gorbachev can not be comfortable with all the old leaders of this generation . " <P> Most of the top command in Eastern Europe dates from the era of Brezhnev or before . With the exception of Poland 's Wojciech Jaruzelski , 62 , all are over 65 , and four out of six have passed 73 . Moreover , they have all shown a greater capacity for political survival than for the kind of shake-up of the bureaucracy that Gorbachev is trying to bring to the U.S.S.R. <P> While Gorbachev has been steadily easing his country 's aging leaders out of power , he apparently has no desire to see the East European party bosses forced into retirement anytime soon . Despite his commitment to revitalize the Soviet bloc 's economy , he values stability even more . Explains a veteran U.S. Government analyst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with superpower relations . He knows that with major changes in either the economic policies or the leadership of his allies , all hell could break loose . He has shown he will not risk that . "
