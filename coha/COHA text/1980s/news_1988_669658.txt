In person , it really is as craggy as on screen - that face . And those eyes - they freeze at a moment ' s notice . And that voice - well , you wouldn ' t want to call it ' ' honeyed gravel ' ' to his face . But then comes the laugh , smoke spilling over boulders ; it starts somewhere deep inside the trim , nattily dressed frame of one of America ' s great character actors . Tonys , Emmys , Oscars - Robards has them all , and most of them for playing mean guys better than almost anybody else. // // Now , Robards is portraying another hard-bitten rogue - this time , in a role rich in theater history . He opened Tuesday on Broadway as James Tyrone , the bitter itinerant actor , in a revival of Eugene O ' Neill ' s ' ' Long Day ' s Journey Into Night , ' ' the Pulitzer-winning play that helped launch Robards ' s career , as Tyrone ' s son , Jamey , three decades ago. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the ' 50s on stage , portraying O ' Neill ' s protagonists - angry , articulate , and lyrical : Hickey , the grim reaper salesman in the 1956 revival of O ' Neill ' s ' ' The Iceman Cometh , ' ' and then later that same year , Jamey , the alcoholic wastrel in ' ' Long Day ' s Journey. ' ' // Throughout his career , Robards has performed in nearly all of O ' Neill ' s major works , including the 1973 revival of ' ' A Moon for the Misbegotten , ' ' with Colleen Dewhurst as co-star and longtime O ' Neill interpreter Jose Quintero as director . In 1985 , Robards reprised his role of Hickey . And now , in the centennial year of the playwright ' s birth , Robards is doing not only ' ' Long Day ' s Journey , ' ' with Dewhurst and Quintero , but a companion production of O ' Neill ' s only comedy , ' ' Ah , Wilderness ! ' ' // How the O ' Neill revival @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk about , ' ' Robards barked in an interview during the pre-Broadway run of ' ' Long Day ' s Journey ' ' at the Yale Repertory Theatre , ' ' all that quintessential O ' Neill stuff ? Oh , I think all that O ' Neill business came about because of the ' Iceman ' we did 32 years ago , ' ' he continued . ' ' People were saying , ' The guy ' s dead ; you ' re going to go broke with that thing . ' Well , we did it . And out of it , Mrs. O ' Neill gave us the rights to ' Long Day ' s Journey . ' By the time I got out of that show , a whole O ' Neill revival had started. // ' ' But we didn ' t really do it ; it was just timing , ' ' Robards demurs. // No , it was more than timing . It was a turning point in American theater . The 1956 revival of ' ' The Iceman Cometh , ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death , set the stage for Robards ' s and Quintero ' s careers and for a reassessment of O ' Neill . The bleak and demanding ' ' Iceman ' ' had unsuccessfully premiered 10 years earlier . O ' Neill ' s widow , Carlotta , was so moved by the successful revival that she granted Quintero the rights to the then-never-produced ' ' Long Day ' s Journey Into Night , ' ' which was immediately hailed as a landmark. // An aversion to the stage // Robards ' s connection to O ' Neill goes back even further , however , to Robards ' s Navy years , when this son of an actor was determined not to work in the theater - that is , until he inadvertently read O ' Neill ' s ' ' Strange Interlude . ' ' ' ' I was in the ship ' s library , ' ' Robards remembers , ' ' and I saw ' Strange Interlude , ' which I thought was some hot book . . . . It got me to thinking , ' What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war ' s over ? ' I hadn ' t been interested in acting , because of all the hard times my dad had had in the industry. ' ' // The parallels between the lives of Robards and O ' Neill have long been noted : Both had difficult relationships with their respective actor fathers ; both suffered bouts of alcoholism and had up-and-down careers . ' ' I don ' t know if I can explain that , ' ' said Robards with a shrug of his expensive-looking tweed jacket , which covers several decades of hard drinking and hard living , which were put behind him only about 10 years ago . There is a pause before he goes on talking. // After an eight-month stint at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts - ' ' I learned how to get on and get off the stage , you know , those valuable things ' ' - Robards knocked around in Off Broadway productions for several years until Quintero tapped him for ' ' Iceman. ' ' // ' ' It was during the interval before the fourth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole audience was on its feet applauding - critics , everybody , ' ' says Robards about that opening . ' ' I was in my dressing room and heard it , and I said , ' . . . They think the play ' s over ! ' So I ran to the back of the auditorium to find Jose Quintero . And he laughed and said , ' It ' s a . . . symphony . ' It was the first time we realized we were knocking ' em dead. ' ' // Since then , the Hickey role has been indelibly linked with Robards . But the actor is intrigued now by the differences between that almost mythical evangelical role and the two father figures he is playing for the centennial. // ' ' These ( plays ) are family things , different from ' Hughie ' and ' Iceman ' and ' Stately Mansions . ' . . . ' ' A lot depends on . . . how you feel with the cast . And we ( he , Dewhurst , and Quintero ) have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We even look like a family. ' ' // Why he stayed with acting // Suddenly Robards adds , ' ' You know , O ' Neill fools you . It happened with the 1973 revival of ' Moon for the Misbegotten . ' We read it , and we said , ' What are we doing ? This is Freudian soap . ' . . . But it isn ' t . It ' s behavior , and you put it up there with the right actors , and - boom ! - it ' s right out of life. ' ' // After playing most of O ' Neill ' s protagonists , has Robards come full circle with America ' s preeminent dramatist ? // ' ' I feel the I guy - I do , ' ' says Robards slowly , dropping his tough-guy persona . ' ' Doing ' Iceman , ' the guy gave me a hand . I was ready to quit ( the theater ) . I was a father with two kids , and we were starving . I ' d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while there ' s no point in going on anymore , kidding yourself you ' re going to be a great actor. // ' ' But ' Iceman ' said , ' Believe in yourself ; trust yourself . ' And I did , and everything in my life changed. ' ' // //
