BOAT PEOPLE Directed by Ann Hui Screenplay by K.C. Chiu <P> Directors who make movies that are " ripped from today 's headlines " must tread a narrow , tortuous path . Pay attention to all the political ambiguities and you risk putting your audience to sleep ; turn history into histrionics and you anger everyone with a special interest . It is to the credit of Hong Kong 's Ann Hui , the 36-year-old director of Boat People , that she has chosen the latter course . Her film is not a meticulous precis of Vietnamese politics ; it is a fast-paced , humanist melodrama centering on one family that , in the chaos of reconstruction that faced the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam after the fall of Saigon in 1975 , finally determines to flee the country on an agonizingly slow boat through the China Sea . <P> Like any movie ( overtly political or not ) with a strong point of view , Boat People is propaganda . Most of Vietnamese officialdom is polite but abrupt , in a hurry to build a model Marxist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " who anchor their dreams in the past or launch them into the faraway future . One aging captain of the revolution , educated in France many years earlier , drowns his disappointments in French poetry and the company of a backstreets madam . A boy of about ten , godfathered by American G.I.s , has the randy strut and rancid mouth of a pint-size Richard Pryor . By 1978 , the year in which the film is set , two bygone eras of colonialism could provide reason for nostalgia simply because they were past and because the present offered little but a grim struggle for survival . <P> These are inferences the talented Hui allows the viewer to draw ; but the pace is hardly ruminative . Mostly , Boat People motors along with Kung Fu industry : visiting a " chicken farm , " where the ten-year-old and his sisters scavenge the effects of recently executed prisoners ; negotiating a field laced with land mines , a legacy of the U.S. involvement ; gazing unflinchingly as the children 's mother impales herself on a hook ; tracing the attempt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Lam Chi-cheung ) , to bribe and fight their way to " freedom , " which here is just another word for some place else to be . <P> Boat People , whose scenario Hui based on eyewitness reports she received from hundreds of Vietnamese refugees , was the first Hong Kong movie to be shot in Communist China . That she made her film with the support of a regime hostile to Viet Nam raised eyebrows . And when Boat People was screened at the Cannes Film Festival in May , and this fall at the New York Film Festival , it raised hackles on the neck of the left . The passions Boat People elicits testify not only to the bitterness of the worldwide debate between left and right but to Hui 's skills as a popular film maker . Boat People should keep informed viewers on the edge of their seats-and awake at night , pondering its remorseless implications . - By Richard Corliss
