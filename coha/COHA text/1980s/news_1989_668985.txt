An otherwise quiet race for an obscure township office in McHenry County is beginning to sound like a Chicago-style political donnybrook . The three-way race is for Algonquin Township supervisor-a job that pays $29 , 000 a year to administer , for the most part , a fund from which less than $8 , 000 was spent last year . In far northwest suburban McHenry County , where residents have been watching the Chicago-based news media ' s coverage of that city ' s mayoral primary for months , the handful of local races on the Feb. 28 Republican primary ballot in isolated locations have been yawners . There is a nonpartisan race for mayor in Woodstock , the county seat ; a school referendum in the City of McHenry ; an exceptionally quiet race for highway commissioner in Nunda Township ; and the developing brouhaha in Algonquin Township . " All they see on TV is Sawyer , Daley and Bloom , " said Robert B. Vorisek , one of the Algonquin Township candidates . " They don ' t realize there ' s an election out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the candidates ' jobs and whether the township is spending too much money on administering its welfare fund . Vorisek , a Fox River Grove resident who serves on the County Board , is the early favorite in the race to replace George F. Starr , who is retiring as supervisor in McHenry County ' s most populous and most suburbanized township . He is being challenged by David A. Krenz , of Cary , a township trustee , and William R. Mack , of Oakwood Hills , a former township trustee . Krenz , who is mounting the strongest challenge to Vorisek , is also an employee of Waste Management Inc. ' s McHenry County subsidiary . That has become something of an issue in environmentally conscious McHenry . The firm is involved in a legal battle with the county over its attempts to open a garbage dump near Union . Though that dump site is 15 miles west of Algonquin Township , Krenz apparently was worried enough about the possible damage from the issue of his employer that he sent a letter to GOP committeemen Feb. 9 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letter also implied his opponents have resorted to " dirty tactics " or " snide innuendoes . " " As a present trustee of Algonquin Township , I know for a fact that we have not been involved with the zoning or any other matter involving the landfill issue . Therefore , I would not have a conflict of interest as other candidates may have . . . . " Krenz wrote , referring to Vorisek ' s membership on the County Board . The County Board not only opposes Waste Management ' s proposed Union dump but is seeking sites for a county-owned dump to prevent any private firms from opening new landfills in the county . But Vorisek points out that though the Township Board on which Krenz sits voted recently to support the Village of Algonquin ' s proposal for a new bridge across the Fox River in the township , it took no stand when Algonquin and Lake in the Hills opposed the digging of a garbage dump on Pyott Road along their common boundary a couple of years ago . Waste Management was not involved in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take a stand on that issue ? " Vorisek asked . " They wanted to build a dump right in the middle of the township , and the township did nothing . " He also criticized Krenz for voting for a 50 percent increase in the supervisor ' s salary four years ago . " Four years ago he voted to raise the supervisor ' s salary to $29 , 000 , and now he wants to run for the job , " Vorisek said . " They are proposing raising the salary again to $32 , 800 , but they spent only $8 , 000 last year on general assistance , " he added . General assistance is a form of emergency welfare distributed by township supervisors . " There hasn ' t been any decision on another pay raise , " Krenz said . " The budget is being worked on right now . " Mack , the third candidate , has stayed off the firing line . The 60-year-old semiretired engineer said he had no specific plans for the township . " Now that I ' ve got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to run , " he said.
