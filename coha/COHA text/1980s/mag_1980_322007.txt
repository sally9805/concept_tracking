The hostage crises in Tehran and Bogot occurred at a time when the morale of the U.S. Foreign Service was already flagging for a number of unrelated reasons . Chief among them , in addition to a growing concern over personal safety : inadequate pay and perks in a period of worldwide inflation , insufficient opportunities for working wives ( or in a few cases husbands ) and a sense that in an age of instantaneous communication the scene of the real action in American diplomacy has shifted from the embassies to Washington . " We used to avoid home assignments like the plague , " says a diplomat at the U.S. embassy in Paris . " It was expensive , and the jobs were less interesting . Now it 's the other way around . " An officer based in Belgrade agrees : " Ten years ago , the problem was : How do you get ' em back to Washington ? Now it 's reversed : How do you get ' em back overseas ? " <P> One result is that the isolated hardship post , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more often shunned in favor of the quieter , more civilized capital . The International Communication Agency ( the revamped U.S. Information Agency ) recently had job openings in both Buenos Aires and Vancouver . Not so many years ago , the Argentine post would have been considered a plum , the Canadian one a backwater bore . This time around , however , there were several dozen applicants for Vancouver and none for Buenos Aires . The reasons : Vancouver is safe and relatively cheap ; Buenos Aires has sporadic political violence and triple-digit inflation . <P> The sorest point of all is pay . Typically , a middle-level officer with about 15 years experience earns $35,000 , a Foreign Service recruit $16,000 , a career ambassador $50,000 . According to the American Foreign Service Association ( A.F.S.A. ) , the gentlemanly union that represents the interests of U.S. diplomats , this salary scale is about 10% lower than that of the Federal Civil Service . To be sure , like other American Government employees abroad , diplomats also receive a housing allowance , a cost-of-living provision and access at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , cigarettes and gasoline . But high prices and the sinking dollar have wiped out these advantages , leaving the diplomats with little more than the special prestige of being an elite corps . The House of Representatives is currently considering a new Foreign Service Act , which includes increased allowances and provides for hazardous-duty pay . Even if approved , these changes will not offset the rising costs that diplomats have experienced in the past five years .
