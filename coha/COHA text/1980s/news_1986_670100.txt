Rock Island , Ill.  --  Bob Reade , who coaches football at Augustana College here , sums up the physical attributes of his players thusly : " If they ' re big , they ' re likely to be slow . If they ' re fast , they ' re likely to be small . " But that ' s not the end of it , the coach adds . " They want to play football and work hard at it , " he says . " If I ' ve learned anything in 30 years of coaching , it ' s that a good attitude toward the game can take you a long way . " A good attitude , and a chartered plane , has taken Reade ' s charges to such exotic places as Phenix City , Ala. , and Cincinnati in recent seasons . Those cities are where the last three NCAA Division III national championships were held . Augustana won ' em all . Going into this campaign , the Vikings also had won 37 football games in a row , the longest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 0-0 , by Elmhurst College , in their opener , but they won their next three , so their games-without-a-loss string stands at 41 , which ain ' t bad . They ' ll try to make that 42 when they play at Illinois Wesleyan tomorrow afternoon . If the above suggests a sort of collegiate Sparta , perish the thought . Augustana prefers to regard itself as more Athenian . A recent vistor ( me ) was quickly told about the excellent geology department at the liberal-arts school with an enrollment of 2 , 100 , and the renowned choir . He was introduced to the Ph . D in English who coaches cross-country track , and the biology prof who is doing notable human-heart research . As one looks up Founder ' s Hill , Augustana seems the very model of a typical American small college . There ' s an old building called " The Main " with a domed bell tower on top . There are tree-shaded walks , ivy aplenty and a Gothic spire or two that reflect Augustana ' s Lutheran affiliation . But there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The largest structure on campus is a physical-education center that houses intramural and varsity indoor sports , and one learns that along with their top-quarter prep grades and 1 , 100-average SAT score or its equivalent , about 80% of last year ' s freshman class  --  boys and girls  --  had earned high-school varsity athletic letters . Some of the boys are pretty fair football players , but they are not lured here with athletic scholarships ; like other Division III members , Augustana doesn ' t award them . It makes grants and loans on the basis of academic promise or financial need . Reade , 54 , does some recruiting , but not the kind Barry Switzer or Joe Paterno would recognize . " I tell kids about our football program and how to apply to the school , but it ' s up to them from there , " says he . " I ' d just as soon not know what they ' re getting in the way of help . None of them has to play football to keep it , so they ' re @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The baldish , quiet-spoken Reade is something of a walk-on himself . Before he came to Augustana in 1979 , he ' d spent the previous 17 years at Darnall High in nearby Geneseo , Ill . His teams there compiled a 146-21-4 record , won three state titles and once had a 52-game win streak . He and his wife , Mary Jo , have 11 children , and enjoy the small-town calm of Geneseo , population 6 , 300 , where they still live . " I had no burning desire to be a college coach , " he says . " I took the Augustana job because I was curious to see if my system would work at another level , and the tuition waiver that faculty people here get . When you have 11 kids , you have to find a way to pay for their college . " The Reade " system " consists of the old-fashioned Wing-T offense and the 5-2 " Oklahoma " defense . The Wing-T is basically a running attack in which all four backs carry the ball and block . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on team speed and alertness and can be used successfully without an outstanding individual passer or runner . The 5-2 defense , he notes , " is just a good , all-around setup that ' s easy to install because so many high schools use it . " He continues : " There ' s no magic in any formation . It ' s what you do after the snap that counts . " Augustana had a 6-3 record in Reade ' s first season here , and lost three of its first five games the next . Then injuries forced him to use an all-freshman backfield . The combination clicked and the team won its remaining four games in 1980 . It went 9-1 in ' 81 and 11-1 in ' 82 , losing in the Division III final . The following year it won all 13 tests and its first national crown . The Vikings practice football hard but not long . During the season they work out from 3 : 30-5 : 30 p. m. on weekdays , play on Saturdays and take Sundays off . There are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conflict between practice and a player ' s class , the class takes precedence . There are other things to like about Augustana football . Viking players pump iron in the off-season , but it ' s not mandatory and nobody takes attendance . Reade never cuts anyone from his team , and this year suits up 110 players . Every one of them sees action on Saturday or in the junior-varsity game Monday afternoon . Last season , 24 different players carried the ball for the Viking varsity . Because Augustana runs a lot and Reade starts substituting early if his team is safely ahead , the Vikings rarely run up big scores on beaten foes . They ' ve topped the 40-point mark just eight times in their 41-game lossless streak . Of its 22 current starters , 12 weigh in at 200 pounds or less . " We ' re mostly good all-around athletes who are playing football because we get the chance here , " says senior Mike Gray , a 6-foot-1-inch , 165-pound redhead who starts in the defensive backfield . He came to Augustana with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ football until his sophomore year . " I got ta admit I was scared to come out for football at first , " Gray goes on . " I ' d played in high school , and this was college and a national-champion team . But I tackled a guy in practice and got up OK , and then I was on the field , playing . Pretty soon , I got the idea : When you play for a champion , you ' re a champion , too. "
