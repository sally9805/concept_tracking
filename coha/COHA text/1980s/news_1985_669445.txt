Weaver , named by club owner Edward Bennett Williams to replace Joe Altobelli , isn ' t the type who wins any popularity contests among his players . But as he showed during his previous 141/2-year reign from 1968 to 1982 , when he led the team to four World Series appearances , he knows how to get maximum effort from them. // Once the game starts , Earl is a dugout war general who holds nothing back . If he has an outfielder who can only hit right-handers , plus another who can only hit left-handers , he ' ll get the ultimate from both of them by platooning . If he has a pitcher he thinks is dogging it , he ' ll have him throw batting practice until his tongue hangs out . To Earl , it ' s just a simple exercise in changing attitudes overnight. // // Weaver isn ' t above playing mental games either if he thinks it can give him an edge . For example , before he took his troops into Boston one year against a hot Red Sox @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the umpires always give Carl Yastrzemski five strikes in Fenway Park . Whether that was the case or not , Yaz was fortunate to get the standard three after Earl ' s remarks. // What Weaver can do with the Orioles in the tough American League East Division , where first-place Toronto has already established a certain amount of superiority and Detroit ' s defending world champions are starting to play to their potential , is mere speculation . But it ' s not as though Earl doesn ' t know most of his players or is seeing the American League up close for the first time. // While Weaver might talk about the virtues of the three-run homer until you get the idea that ' s all he ever thinks about , he ' s smart enough to know that where it really begins is with pitching . Earl isn ' t noted for his patience , either - so look for the current Oriole hurlers to start lowering their earned-run averages pretty quickly or else find themselves on the sidelines watching somebody else give it a try. // The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the latter had led the team to the 1983 world championship was that he didn ' t think Joe was getting the most from his material this time around . Altobelli ' s personality was also too passive for the owner , who prefers managers with enough brass to start a band. // Williams rejected the suggestion of General Manager Hank Peters that he give Altobelli at least until the July All-Star break to get the club back in contention . His patience was wearing thin after spending millions over the winter on free agents Fred Lynn , Lee Lacy , and Don Aase . Williams had hoped that his team , boosted by the addition of these players , would enjoy the same kind of super start this season that the Tigers had last year . After an 18-9 getaway and a brief taste of first place , however , the Orioles went into an 11-17 tailspin , including five losses in a row last week , and Williams decided it was time to make the change . <> <> Carter surprised he wound up with Mets // // All-Star @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best thing that ever happened to a newspaperman in need of a quick feature . Carter always seems able to make time for his interviewers , even when he ' s jumping in and out of the batting cage with the rest of the Met regulars . And while Gary hasn ' t yet hit for average this season , he has been one of the club ' s top RBI producers. // Carter , who was third in the National League in 1984 in home runs with 27 , admits that he was surprised last December when the Montreal Expos traded him to a pennant-contending team in the same division. // ' ' I ' d heard rumors even before the end of last season that I was going somewhere , but I figured the other division or maybe even the American League , ' ' Gary explained . ' ' Usually if a franchise is moving a pretty good hitter , it won ' t take a chance that he might come back and have some big games against them . And while I ' m not going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else , there is that little extra mental incentive that stays around for a while. ' ' // Asked what it was like to catch Dwight Gooden , the Mets ' phenomenal 20-year-old strikeout king with the 95 m. p. h. fastball , Carter said : ' ' There have been two pitchers during my career that have been around the plate so often that I could have caught them sitting in a rocking chair . One is Gooden and the other is Steve Rogers ( who recently was released by Montreal and signed with the California Angels ) , except that Rogers never had the kind of power that could consistently blow hitters away. // ' ' Right now , because Gooden is even better than he was a year ago , people are assuming that because of my experience as a catcher that I ' ve had something to do with that , ' ' Gary continued . ' ' Well , I haven ' t . Dwight knows how to pitch and doesn ' t need or get any input from me . I mean he does it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a changeup to go with his fastball , he ' s really got the hitters confused. ' ' // One pitcher on the Mets who isn ' t getting the break he deserves from the press though , according to Carter , is Ron Darling , another of those strong-armed kids who regularly strikes out more than twice as many batters as he walks. // ' ' In my opinion , Darling is just a shade behind Gooden in ability , ' ' Gary said . ' ' He ' s another kid who someday is going to win 20 games in the big leagues . ' ' <> <> Elsewhere around the major leagues // // // * As a manager , it may be the worst of times for Chuck Tanner of the last-place Pittsburgh Pirates . But as a father , Tanner can point to his 23-year-old son Bruce with pride . Signed as a free-agent pitcher by the Chicago White Sox in 1983 , Bruce last week won his major league debut beating the Seattle Mariners 6-3 in the Kingdome . Tanner allowed seven hits in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three strikeouts and two bases on balls. // // * It is only a matter of time insiders say before Atlanta Braves Owner Ted Turner fires rookie manager Ed Haas ( not aggressive enough for Turner ) and offers the job to Yogi Berra , who doesn ' t have a reputation for being tough on players either . Even though Yankee owner George Steinbrenner is currently paying Berra $150 , 000 to play golf for the rest of the season , Yogi admittedly would be happier back in uniform. // It is interesting that when Berra was with the Yankees as a player , the club won 16 American League pennants in 20 years . The first time the Yankees fired Yogi as manager , after the team lost the 1964 World Series in seven games , the Bronx Bombers went 11 years before they won their next pennant . In fact , the Yankees didn ' t make another World Series appearance until 1976 , when Steinbrenner brought Yogi back as a coach under Billy Martin. // // // //          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
