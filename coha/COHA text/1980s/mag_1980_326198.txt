Howard Hughes'cousin tackles a tangled financial empire <P> The resemblance is eerie , down to the gangling walk , the tight-lipped smile and the soft Texas accent . William R. Lummis , 51 , is almost a double for the middle-aged Howard R. Hughes Jr. , the eccentric billionaire who died on April 5 , 1976 , aboard a jet that was flying him from Acapulco to his native Houston . Lummis , Hughes ' first cousin , is now standing in as head of most Hughes enterprises , a chaotic financial empire once estimated to be worth $2.3 billion . Lummis last week took another major step toward straightening out the family business when he sold Hughes Airwest , the West Coast carrier , to Republic Airlines for $38.5 million . <P> Ironically , Lummis ( pronounced Luhmiss ) did not even know Hughes , who lived the last 15 years of his life in seclusion and deprivation . A partner in one of Houston 's most prestigious law firms , Andrews , Kurth , Campbell &; Jones , Lummis saw his cousin alive only twice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Four years ago , when he went to the Texas Medical Center to claim Hughes ' body , Lummis was shown an ugly , wasted corpse and had to ask with consternation , " Is this Mr. Hughes ? " When it became apparent that Hughes had died without leaving a will , Lummis , whose mother was Hughes ' closest living relative , was named the representative for a group of distant Hughes relations . <P> At his death , Hughes ' financial empire was nearly as wasted as his body . His holdings ranged from a major aircraft company and a helicopter manufacturer to casinos in Las Vegas , Reno and the Bahamas , ranches in Nevada , a magazine ( Football Today ) , a television station ( Las Vegas ' KLAS-TV ) , mines in Nevada and vast amounts of undeveloped land . Most of the interests were grouped together in the Las Vegas-based Summa Corp. , which , Lummis concluded , was run by a group of Hughes lieutenants of dubious ability and honesty . These included Chester C. Davis , Summa 's general counsel ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a board director ; and Nadine Henley , once Hughes ' stenographer . <P> After studying Summa 's hard-to-find financial records , Merrill Lynch estimated that between 1970 and 1976 the corporation had lost $131.7 million . The company , for example , spent about $50 million to maintain the legendary Spruce Goose , the huge , 400,000-lb. wooden flying boat with a 320-ft. wingspan that Hughes had piloted once for a distance of a mile in 1947 and then stored away in a Long Beach , Calif. , hangar . Other losses flowed from the hotels that Summa owned but managed haphazardly , a company formed to promote blood-analysis devices , Football Today , and a worldwide fleet of 34 aircraft ready to answer the whims of Hughes and his staff . Said Lummis last week : " Hughes was a lightning rod for every disaster imaginable . "
