It is painful but true . The U.S. armed forces have been neglected to the point that their very ability to defend the nation 's interests is in jeopardy . There are two basic remedies : a lot more money and a revival of the draft . <P> The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff last month appeared before the Senate Armed Services Committee to speak about the military 's readiness to combat the Soviets . General David C. Jones said that in certain areas of the world the Soviets have " substantial advantages . " The Chief of Naval Operations , Admiral Thomas B. Hayward , described the Carter-proposed 1982 budget as " wholly inadequate . " Such growls are a traditional feature of the budget process , but this time the military commanders are right . The U.S. armed forces today are undermanned , underequipped and underpaid . <P> The most urgent problem does not concern the strategic weapons of Armageddon . There the U.S. has a rough parity with the Soviets and seems ready to respond to any vulnerability that might arise . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weapons that are essential to the kind of conflict that is most likely to occur : some sudden clash with the Soviets or their proxies on the borders of Central Europe , in the Persian Gulf or in the Middle East . <P> Of the Air Force 's 3,813 tactical aircraft , for example , between 26% and 48% on any given day are " not mission capable . " One reason : a spare parts shortage so severe that some planes are simply cannibalized to keep others in action . The U.S. Army has only about half the trucks it needs . The Navy now has 456 warships ( down from 702 in 1972 ) , and says it needs 600 . That would provide for three new carrier battle groups , in addition to the present twelve , which would allow the U.S. to maintain a permanent presence in the Indian Ocean , the Mediterranean and the western Pacific . <P> Equally alarming is the steady loss of skilled and experienced soldiers and technicians . The Air Force is short 1,650 pilots ( the retention rate for Navy pilots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . The Army still has its 16 authorized divisions , but the ten based in the continental U.S. are understrength , and a confidential Army report rated six of them as " noncombat ready . " Overall , the Navy is short 20,000 petty officers , the Army 7,000 NCOS . One of the most important military requirements is the capacity to airlift combat troops to a crisis area , but the Rapid Deployment Force established by President Carter last March can not begin to deploy rapidly . It lacks airlift and sealift capability and even such basics as adequate communications gear . Its command function is mired in a jurisdictional dispute between the Army and the Marine Corps . <P> For years the basic problems of military supply and maintenance have been neglected . Congressmen prefer to vote funds for expensive new weaponry that provides jobs for key defense industries back home , rather than put the same money into something as mundane-but vital-as maintenance . It has also proved easier to get funds for designing ever more sophisticated weapons than to increase the supply of prosaic ones . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
