" If there is to be blame , " Mr. Reagan said , " it properly rests here in this office and with this President . I accept responsibility for the bad as well as the good. " // While acknowledging that the marines were ill-prepared to deal with the Oct. 23 terrorist truck bombing that took 241 lives , the President said their commanders " have already suffered quite enough . " <> <> Report ' s Conclusions Listed // Speaking at a hastily called news conference this morning before leaving for his ranch in California , the President said he had read the report of the special Defense Department commission that has investigated the bombing . That 166-page report , which criticizes the marines ' security precautions , has not been made public . But officials who have read the report , or who were involved in its preparation , discussed it today . They said these were among its conclusions : // - The marines were in a difficult position in an increasingly hostile environment and were not adequately trained to deal with terrorists. // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Marine commander in Beirut and the admirals and generals above him , shares blame for failing to insure that proper security precautions were taken against terrorists. // // - The marines did not have the ability to analyze the mass of intelligence on possible terrorist threats that they were receiving. // // - The marines should not have housed so many men in one building , presenting a sizable target for terrorists. // // - United States personnel responded well immediately after the bombing and were correct in evacuating casualties to Europe rather than to closer Israeli hospitals that had been offered. // // - In the weeks following the attack , the marines did reduce their vulnerability to terrorist attacks , but their precautions were still inadequate . <> <> ' Felt It Would Be Unfair ' // Although the report did not advise disciplinary action , it recommended that Secretary of Defense Caspar W. Weinberger take whatever disciplinary or administrative action he deemed appropriate . A White House official said today that after reading the report , Mr. Reagan decided he would override that recommendation. // The official @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the marines of responsibility before the report was made public because it was critical of them. // " He felt it would be unfair to the guys out there to have a board of inquiry or a court-martial hanging over them , " the official said . " It would be unfair to discipline them for something nobody could anticipate. " // The President " does accept that the marines ' security precautions were lax , " the official said . " But you have to realize there are two terms : responsibility and culpability. " // Of the marines , he said the President believes : " Responsibility , yes ; culpability , no . " <> <> Commission Member Pleased // The official said Mr. Reagan received the commission report late Friday and reviewed it over the weekend . He was given a list of possible options for action by the national security adviser , Robert C. McFarlane , with no particular recommendation on which one to choose , the official said. // At his news conference , Mr. Reagan said he had " soberly considered the commission ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the chain of command . " But , Mr. Reagan said , he did not believe that the marines ' commanders " should be punished for not fully comprehending the nature of today ' s terrorist threat. " // Adm . Robert L. J. Long , retired , who was chairman of the five-member commission , said he would not comment on the President ' s remarks today . But another commission member , Robert J. Murray , director of national security studies at Harvard University ' s Kennedy School of Government , said he was pleased with the President ' s statement. // Mr. Murray , a former Under Secretary of the Navy , said he thought it was " a good idea " not to punish any of the commanders , and he said his views " are a reasonable summation of the commission ' s point of view . " <> <> Officers ' Did Best They Could ' // The Long Commission report " did find things that could have been done better , " Mr. Murray said , " but we didn ' t offer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Secretary of Defense to do as he saw fit. " // Mr. Murray said the commission found that the Marine commanders and their superiors " did the best they could under difficult circumstances. " // " Basically , " he said , " no one who was guilty of sins was guilty of unreasonable sins. " // Of Col. Timothy J. Geraghty , who commanded the unit in Beirut at the time of the bombing , Mr. Murray said the commission concluded that " it wasn ' t that he was being stupid or casual or indifferent " to the security of his men . " No one foresaw the chain of events that would occur. " // Mr. Murray said the findings of the Long Commission report were " reasonably consistent with the findings " of the highly critical report on the bombing issued last week by the House Armed Services ' Investigations subcommittee . <> <> ' His Decision to Make ' // " Their conclusions are the same as our conclusions , " he added , " except on one point : General Kelley . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marine commandant , saying his testimony to Congress a few days after the bombing contained many inaccuracies. // But the Long Commission report " does not mention General Kelley , " Mr. Murray said . " He was not in the operational chain of command. " // Representative William Nichols , the Alabama Democrat who was chairman of the subcommittee that investigated the bombing , said he would not comment on President Reagan ' s decision not to discipline any officers , saying " that is his decision to make. " // But Representative Larry Hopkins , the Kentucky Republican who is the subcommittee ' s ranking minority member , said : " I admire the President for accepting the blame , but I respectfully disagree . The President should not be held responsible for the failures of military commanders to exercise sufficient oversight on security matters. " // He added , " I think the blame falls between the White House and Beirut. " //
