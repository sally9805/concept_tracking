J. Edgar Hoover liked his FBI agents to have degrees in law , accounting or both , but it now turns out that the bureau could have used some Ph.D.s in English . Both The New Yorker and The Nation magazines last week documented nearly half a century of FBI surveillance of more than 100 prominent American writers , including six Nobel laureates ( Sinclair Lewis , Pearl Buck , William Faulkner , Ernest Hemingway , Eugene O'Neill and John Steinbeck ) . The gumshoe lit crit was sometimes comically inept . FBI files , for example , described the poetry of Edna St. Vincent Millay as possibly subversive because she used the " analogy of the mole boring under the garden . " <P> Only a few of the shadowed authors were aware of the surveillance . " Do you suppose you could ask Edgar 's boys to stop stepping on my heels ? " wrote John Steinbeck to Attorney General Francis Biddle in 1942 . " It 's getting tiresome . "               @ @ @ @ @ @
