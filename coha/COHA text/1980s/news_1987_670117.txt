The U.S. dollar fell sharply against major European currencies yesterday , exacerbating strains within the European Monetary System . In Europe , several central banks continued to play an active role in foreign-exchange markets , supporting their respective currencies against the West German mark . In some cases , the mark traded at its highest permissible level in the EMS , the joint float of eight European currencies . The Bank of Japan also was reported to have intervened yesterday to support the dollar against the yen . In addition to selling yen for dollars in Asia , traders said the Japanese central bank intervened in the New York market via the Federal Reserve Bank of New York . Traders said selling of marks for French francs by the West German and French central banks yesterday was slightly below Wednesday ' s levels , when each of the central banks was estimated to have purchased as much as four billion francs . Besides the French franc , the Belgian and Danish currencies also remained near their EMS floors against the mark . The Italian lira fell to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floor against the West German currency . The Bank of Italy sold marks at the Milan foreign-exchange fixing and also was said to be active in the open market . The central bank also bought $30 million at the fixing . The Belgian central bank reportedly sold marks against its currency , though on a relatively small scale since the Belgian franc strengthened slightly after that country ' s half-point discount rate increase , which took effect today . Some foreign-exchange traders believe the strains within the EMS are almost entirely linked to the dollar ' s decline . As speculators sell the U.S. unit in interbank markets , they tend to buy marks , which strengthens the West German unit in relation to other European currencies . " This problem in Europe is really a dollar problem , " said Garrett R. Glass , vice president of foreign-exchange at First National Bank of Chicago .
