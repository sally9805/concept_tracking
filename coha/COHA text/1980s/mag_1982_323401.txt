TIME 'S economists look for the July tax cut to start the recovery <P> Will the consumer spend it or save it ? That is the $50 billion question facing the U.S. economy . In July , the Government will begin giving out $39 billion in tax cuts , the second installment of the three-year personal income tax reduction that Congress passed last year , and $11.5 billion in increased Social Security benefits . If the American consumer quickly spends most of that money , the extra business that will be created should be enough to end the nearly yearlong recession . But if the consumer decides to hold onto that extra cash or to pay off his debts , the economy is likely to continue limping along . <P> That was the verdict of TIME 'S Board of Economists , which met last week in Manhattan to assess the state of the U.S. and world economies . For now , the economists predict that consumer spending will increase sufficiently to give the U.S. a 3.3% annual growth rate during the second half of the year . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their purchases of autos , refrigerators , clothing and other goods . For example , they spent about 80% of the $9 billion in personal tax relief in 1964-65 , setting cash registers ringing and helping spur a robust expansion . The expectation is that the American public this year , just as in 1964 , will eventually spend most of the tax cut . <P> Nonetheless , the question marks hanging over the economy are more numerous than usual .

We have to watch very , very closely the retail sales of July and August because if they do n't go up , then we are in much deeper trouble . " <P> There were a few hints last week that business might soon be starting to pick up a little . The Commerce Department reported that its index of leading economic indicators , which attempts to predict future business trends , rose .8% in April-its first increase in twelve months . Auto sales increased a surprisingly strong 12.3% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'S economists saw other encouraging signs that the slump may soon end . Runaway inflation has subsided , enabling the public to stretch its money further . The Administration 's $1.6 trillion defense buildup is also helping to stimulate a recovery . Corporations that have been decreasing their inventories appear ready to start restocking shelves . That would mean that companies may soon begin stepping up production and rehiring workers . <P> Continuing signals of economic weakness , however , were also evident last week . The value of new building contracts slid 16% in April . Housing starts are now running at an annual rate of just 881,000 units , compared with about 2 million five years ago .
