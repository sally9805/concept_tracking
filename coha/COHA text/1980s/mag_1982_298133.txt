The old boys wrestle with another spy scandal <P> The headquarters of Britain 's electronic intelligence empire is a sprawling compound at Cheltenham , 95 miles northwest of London and nestled among the scenic hills of Gloucestershire . Known in the trade as GCHQ ( for Government Communications Headquarters ) , the facility receives and analyzes data from a worldwide system of spy bases , ships , planes and satellites . It operates round the clock and employs some 10,000 staffers round the globe . Cheltenham is a vital part of the West 's constant effort to break the Soviet Union 's military and diplomatic codes . Now there is a distinct possibility that GCHQ may have unwittingly been providing information to the Soviets , a disaster that , if true , could nullify many of Britain 's code-breaking efforts and jeopardize its intelligence links to the U.S. <P> This newest in a long string of British spy scandals came to light with the announcement that Geoffrey Arthur Prime , 44 , a former employee of GCHQ , had been arrested and charged with violating Section 1 of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ details of the accusations against Prime , but that section of the act deals with , among other things , the passing on of secret codes or documents to a potential enemy . A Russian-language specialist , Prime had worked at GCHQ from 1968 to 1977 . He then left voluntarily and subsequently held jobs as a taxi driver and a wine salesman in the town of Cheltenham . At the time of his charging a fortnight ago , he was unemployed . His trial is scheduled to begin in November . <P> Britain would not be the only country affected by a breach of GCHQ security . The Cheltenham facility is part of a four-nation intelligence net that also includes the U.S. , Canada and Australia . GCHQ shares its cryptographic expertise with Washington 's top-secret National Security Agency ( NSA ) , an organization that gathers intelligence based on electronic eavesdropping . In return , the NSA passes on some of its intelligence and provides technical assistance . Moreover , the U.S. maintains spy bases in Britain whose data are processed at GCHQ , and Cray I , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is American-made . <P> U.S. officials said last week that it was too soon to tell whether , or to what extent , Western intelligence had been compromised . It was clear , however , that Washington 's patience was wearing thin . British spy scandals have been a Western burden since the days of Kim Philby and his fellow double agents , Donald Maclean and Guy Burgess , all Cambridge graduates and members of the old-boy network , who were unmasked as Soviet agents . U.S. spymasters say that they have tried ever since to persuade their British counterparts to tighten security , but with only limited success . " The British are very good at gathering and analyzing information , " says one intelligence expert . But , he notes , " they do not keep their eye on their people . "
