BODY HEAT Directed and Written by Lawrence Kasdan <P> It is 1946 ; it is 1981 . Overhead fans languidly attempt to rearrange the air . Late afternoon heat seeps through the Venetian blinds . A tenor sax investigates the upper registers of despair . Ned Racine ( William Hurt ) drags voraciously on a nonstop series of cigarettes . He wears a Clark Gable mustache and a Zachary Scott hat . And one night , as a Dorsey-style orchestra plays That Old Feeling , a sleek , tanned woman in white emerges from the darkness of the band shell and into the rest of Ned 's life . <P> Body Heat-wonderful title-bears a family resemblance in plot and tone to James M. Cain 's Double Indemnity : a man more ordinary than he thinks he is meets a newly rich femme fatale ; sparks fly , plots hatch , a husband dies , insurance claims are debated , friendships fray , the lovers quarrel and part explosively . And though Lawrence Kasdan 's film is set in today 's South Florida , its characters move through an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a 1940s film noir . <P> " You 're not too smart , " Matty Walker ( Kathleen Turner ) tells Ned at their first meeting . " I like that in a man . " She does indeed ; Matty is too smart for both of them . A detective friend of Ned 's describes her as " one quick , smart broad " whose special gift is relentlessness . At the outset , Matty is trapped in comfortable domesticity , married to a wealthy land speculator ( Richard Crenna ) 20 years older than she . But her ambition is " to be rich and live in an exotic land . " The insurance money that would be hers with her husband 's death represents air fare to that dream world . And Ned-lousy lawyer , good pal , nice-guy stud-may prove to be her passport . <P> As the only female principal in a cast of shysters , cops and crooks-and as the agent of their anxiety-Matty might seem one more example of moviemaker misogyny hiding behind the imperatives of the thriller genre . She surely is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But she is also the one figure of reckless imagination . Smoothly and confidently , she guides the taut mechanism of the movie 's plot . She creates between herself and Ned a sexual attraction that erases the past and suggests terrible new options . And she knows , as a young woman whose Midwestern memories are as sordid as her Palm Beach present is posh , that she must sweat for what she wants . The film and the other characters sweat with her . Perspiration stains the satin sheets as Ned and Matty make love ; and after , there is dew on the down of her back as she caresses and coaxes him . She is the mistress of these ceremonies , leading Ned on by his lust toward acts of love and murder .
