These days , Mr. Maazel ' s name is on many minds in the music world as a leading candidate - the leading candidate in managerial shoptalk - to succeed Herbert von Karajan , who died last month , at the Berlin Philharmonic . Some in the business are speaking as though the match were a fait accompli , though everyone connected with either party is careful not to say anything definite. // Mr. Maazel , the music director of the Pittsburgh Symphony , reached in Paris the other day , would say only that " the Berlin Philharmonic has lost its father and guide , and the choice that it will finally make should be made in the silence of its collective heart , without pressure from anyone within or without the profession. " // Asked whether his representatives were in negotiation with the orchestra , he replied : " The process is a rather complicated one , and any of the three or four people they might be interested in would want extensive discussions of what the relationship would be . No overtures of an official kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Like Their Son ' // The conductor also recalled that his own first commercial recordings , made in 1957 , were with the Berlin Philharmonic , and that his relationship with the orchestra was close throughout the Karajan years . " I was like their son for so many years , " he said , " but now , with so many younger players in the orchestra , I ' m getting to feel kind of fatherly . " Mr. Maazel is scheduled to make an extensive series of recordings with the Berlin orchestra for Sony Classics ( the company that now owns CBS Masterworks , formerly Columbia Records ) When he recorded with the Berlin for the first time , at age 27 , Mr. Maazel had a track record that was , if nothing else , incontestably longer than anyone else his age could claim. // All this started in Los Angeles when Mr. Maazel ' s parents ( his father was a professional singer and his mother an accomplished amateur pianist , with several generations of musical background on both sides of the family ) noticed that their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the piano . " My teacher was dubious at first , " Mr. Maazel recalled , " because he had never heard of a child-prodigy conductor . But he tested me , and he seemed to consider my ear and my memory adequate , so he took me on. " // So it happened that before startling New York as a 9-year-old conductor , he had been something marginally more unusual still , an 8-year-old conductor. // " The year before , " Mr. Maazel said , " I conducted my teacher ' s school orchestra in Moscow , Idaho . " His teacher was Vladimir Bakaleinikoff , a violist and conductor who had defected from the Soviet Union . " I did the ' Unfinished ' symphony and accompanied my teacher in a Handel concerto , " Mr. Maazel recalled . <> <> Leader in Short Pants // Then in 1939 came concerts at the National Music Camp at Interlochen , Mich .

" I watched him rehearse , and he watched me , " Mr. Maazel recalled . " He came to my rehearsal and stayed for at least half of it and then I was presented to him . He said ' God bless you , ' several times . " Any tips on the G minor symphony ? " No - I would have been overwhelmed . Toscanini was something more than God to me in those days.

" // At the University of Pittsburgh he thought of changing directions and studied philosophy , literature and languages . <> <> Career-Building in Italy // But while in Italy on a Fulbright scholarship he was drafted back into conducting . " It was at Christmastime in 1953 , " he said , " and they needed a replacement in Catania for a conductor who was ill . Whether it was the holiday or I don ' t know what , they couldn ' t find anybody , and they called the Fulbright committee to ask if they had any conductors studying here . They were that desperate . So the committee looked in the files and called me . I was reluctant , but it turned out that three of the four pieces on the program I had conducted already , so I did it .

" And after that one thing led to another in classic career-building fashion. // The career - centered on West Berlin ' s Deutsche Oper and on the Cleveland Orchestra in the years that saw Mr. Maazel ' s rise to the top of the profession - has not been without its stormy interludes , most notably the conductor ' s foreshortened tenure as the head of the Vienna State Opera in the early 1980 ' s . Mr. Maazel resigned after only a year and a half of a four-year contract , after what he called intolerable interference in artistic matters on the part of the culture minister and a local music critic who advised the minister . " After that , " he said , " I was offered the music directorate of La Scala and I turned it down . I ' m just not interested in running an opera house again.

" I think among American orchestras Pittsburgh has the best tradition in the German classics , and I thought it would be fun to work with it for a few years - to have an opportunity to bring in some tough , fine young players , which we have done , and to tour . We are just about to go to Russia and Poland , and my recording contract with Sony will include recordings with the Pittsburgh.

A conductor who once auditioned for an assistant ' s position with Mr. Maazel recalls him saying he could memorize a score in an afternoon if he put his mind to it. // " I never saw a pop singer put a song across while looking at a sheet of paper , " Mr. Maazel said , " and if memory is needed for freedom at that level , I think it must be pretty important at ours.
