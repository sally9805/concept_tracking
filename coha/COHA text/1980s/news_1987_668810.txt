George de Lama is a member of The Tribune ' s Washington bureau . Ronald Reagan and his supporters could never have imagined it would come to this back in 1984 , not after the thundering re-election landslide that buried Walter Mondale . The talk from the White House then was of a President standing tall , bolstered by a popular mandate to carry out his policies , and anticipating the opportunity to cement his presidency into a historical monument . Now , little more than two years later , Reagan ' s aides are more likely to talk of limiting the damage , fending off the critics , finding a way to regain the magic . And quickly , before it is too late . The clock is ticking for Ronald Reagan , and even some of his most devoted supporters fear that the last two years of his presidency are in serious danger of slipping into ignominy . Plagued by the Iranian arms affair , vacancies in key government posts , a foreign policy in disarray and a domestic program that has drawn yawns on Capitol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is demoralized and defensive . Reagan , still shaky from prostate surgery last month , must do battle against a Congress controlled by Democrats intent on recapturing the White House next year . At the same time he must fight the lethargy and inertia that has pervaded the second terms of past presidents , even popular ones like Dwight D. Eisenhower . On balance , Reagan ' s presidency appears destined to be regarded as one of the most successful of modern times , and his difficulties pale compared to the troubles that dogged the terms of some of his immediate predecessors in the nation ' s highest office . Jimmy Carter suffered the humiliation of election defeat after trying in vain to free hostages seized in Iran . Richard Nixon resigned in disgrace , narrowly escaping impeachment as a result of the Watergate scandal . Lyndon Johnson ' s presidency collapsed under the weight of the Vietnam War and the Texan abruptly chose not to run again . No one suggests Reagan will leave office under a similar cloud . Still , Reagan ' s problems are mounting . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last week added another sorry chapter to the unfolding story of secret sales of arms to Iran and the covert attempt to support rebels fighting the Nicaraguan government . This dual issue has come to dominate the presidency and diminish all other matters . The White House is already bracing for more bad news on that score . The Tower Commission report on its investigation into the arms sales to Iran and the alleged diversion of some profits to Nicaraguan contras is due within the next two weeks . It is not expected to provide a flattering appraisal of the President or his most trusted White House aides . " I think it ' s going to be a very critical report and a very tough report , " said White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater . Complicating matters further for Reagan , the congressional investigations into the Iran-contra affair are likely to run at least through this fall , according to senior White House officials . A separate investigation by Independent Counsel Lawrence Walsh could take a year to complete . By this fall , of course , the 1988 presidential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the President ' s supporters that the rest of the Reagan era could simply slide away into irrelevancy . " By the end of this summer , by the fall , let ' s face it , we ' re already in a political year , " a former Reagan aide said . " If you ' re still just muddling and marking time , a turnaround is just not going to happen . " Another key Republican strategist with close ties to the White House suggested : " It ' s just terribly sad , everything that ' s happened . But I just don ' t see any way he can get back up . By this fall , everybody will be looking ahead to next year . " Some Democrats , sensing that a powerful adversary is wounded , are starting to circle for the kill . " The Reagan administration is in ruins , " Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan ( D. , N.Y. ) said last week . " About half the Cabinet wants to leave , probably will . The White House staff is emptying out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ era is over . " Other Democrats are reluctant to go that far . Polls show the President remains popular among Americans , even if they don ' t believe him about Iran . And , supporters point out , Reagan has been on the ropes before , only to leave chagrined many a skeptic who underestimated his ability to bounce back . Foreign policy achievements , often the hallmark of a president ' s second term , could help reverse Reagan ' s fortunes , some supporters say . An unexpected foreign crisis could rally the country around the President . Another summit with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev or an arms control deal with Moscow could swing the pendulum back Reagan ' s way . Reagan is facing the distressing prospect that the paramount legacy of his presidency may be the largest budget deficit in American history , despite the relative prosperity that has marked the latter years of his term . It would be a remarkable coup if he could cut substantially the size of the nation ' s deficit . But the odds against success are long , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the full implications of the crisis that has engulfed his White House . " I still don ' t think he understands the dimensions of the problem , " said a former aide who maintains close links to the White House . " He has a great ability to rationalize things . Most people are not going to change their minds anymore about Reagan at this point ; his polls aren ' t going to go down much more . But most Americans simply don ' t believe him , either . " The two biggest strengths of Ronald Reagan over the years are that he ' s been consistent in his presidency and that he ' s been seen as trustworthy and truthful . Both of these things have been eroded by the Iran thing , " this veteran Reagan partisan argued . There is some evidence that alarm is slowly penetrating to Reagan ' s inner circle . A senior White House official acknowledged the damage from the Iran- contra affair has been lasting and is not likely to diminish soon . " It ' s going to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " Nothing you could do would put it behind the President . Nothing . I don ' t think you put Iran behind you , you try to put it beside you . " So far , Reagan has steadfastly rejected a persistent suggestion for extricating himself from the grip of the Iran affair : firing White House Chief of Staff Donald Regan . Regan , who has been blamed for what many Reagan supporters consider a failed second term , has weathered repeated calls for his dismissal or resignation since the secret dealings with Iran became public last November . Criticized by politicians of both parties for his imperious personal style and lack of political savvy , Regan " just rubs people wrong , and he ' s standing in the way of the President getting cooperation up here , " a Republican congressional leader said . Despite the difficulties , by all accounts the President and some of his aides are optimistic about the future . They believe the 76-year-old Reagan has dispelled most doubts about his health by delivering his State of the Union address last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officials insist Reagan will come charging out of semi- seclusion in the next two weeks , lobbying for his " competitiveness " package of trade and education legislation next week and unveiling his welfare reform plan before the end of the month . Reagan stepped up his schedule somewhat last week , announcing his new catastrophic health care insurance plan for the nation ' s elderly and pitching his welfare proposal to Republican groups brought to the White House . Aides carefully leaked word that former Reagan political adviser Stuart Spencer , a shrewd strategist with strong ties on Capitol Hill , would be returning to the White House to help " turn things around " for the President . Yet these efforts to reassert Reagan ' s leadership underscore shortcomings within the White House that have become painfully obvious to Republican supporters in Congress . The health care insurance plan was quickly dismissed by Democratic congressional leaders as not going nearly far enough to solve a serious national problem . Rep. Claude Pepper ( D. , Fla. ) , the unofficial spokesman for America ' s elderly , ridiculed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spencer considered the White House offer and politely declined , citing other " pressing commitments . " The rejection highlighted the impression that talented conservatives and Reaganites are reluctant to board a sinking ship . Meanwhile , disputes over policy matters continue among the President ' s planners . While Reagan was stumping for his welfare reform plan last week , behind the scenes Labor Secretary William Brock , Budget Director James Miller and Health and Human Services Secretary Otis Bowen each registered objections with a White House draft circulating through their departments , sources said . The resulting debate and revisions showed that the President was out pushing a program that did not yet exist . Key foreign policy issues are unresolved . The administration ' s internal divisions , a lack of support on Capitol Hill and concerns from European allies have delayed a decision on how to proceed with Reagan ' s cherished Strategic Defense Initiative . Another of Reagan ' s priorities , a request for an additional $105 million to keep the Nicaraguan contras fighting next year , has been put off until the fall because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lose the vote now . The frustration felt by White House officials is shared by the President ' s supporters in Congress . House Minority Leader Robert Michel ( R. , Ill. ) said that even with " Iran hanging around his neck , " Reagan needs to come up " with a plan around which we can rally . " Some conservatives inside and outside the administration disagree . They have urged Reagan to adopt a " defensive posture , " confronting Democrats in Congress at every turn with a veto strategy aimed at salvaging his earlier programs and policies and helping the Republican Party regain the initiative in 1988 . " What you ' ve got to do is stand up and start vetoing all those Democratic spending bills , go out and draw a line in the sand , " a prominent GOP political strategist said .
