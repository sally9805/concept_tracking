NO PARKING EN ESTE DRIVEWAY reads a sign in Miami , and motorists know exactly what it means . In Los Angeles , shopkeepers do not miss a beat if a customer asks , " Donde esta la panty hose ? " When a newly arrived Manhattanite asks his neighbor , " Tienes un VCR ? " the reply is immediate : " Over there , under la TV . " <P> This linguistic paella , a free-form blend of Spanish and English , is popularly known as Spanglish . It is becoming an increasingly common conversational mode in areas with heavy concentrations of Hispanic immigrants , especially California , the Gulf Coast and New York City . The informal acceptance of this hybrid reflects the fact that in those areas Spanish has become more than a foreign language though still less than a second language . <P> Some Spanglish sentences are essentially English with a couple of Spanish words thrown in ( " Do you have cold cerveza ? " ) . Others are basically Spanish in structure with Hispanicized words borrowed from English ( " Donde @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the two languages is also producing new verb forms that are not found in any textbook . " Quieres monkear ? " is one way of saying " Want to hang out ? " Borrowed from the slang infinitive " to monkey around , " the Spanglish verb monkear is used in the same way as truckear , which refers to working around trucks , shopear ( i.e. , at the market ) and mopear ( the kitchen floor ) . <P> Some English words are transferred without alteration into Spanglish because they are handier than their Spanish equivalents . Any Spanglish-speaking accountant knows , for instance , that it is easier to say " nineteen forty- five " than " mil novecientos cuarenta y cinco . " Says Judith Schomber , an associate professor of Spanish at Georgia Southern College , who hears Spanglish in the conversations of her students : " They plug in the English words unconsciously . It is done so naturally as to be almost undetectable . " <P> Comfortable as this slang may be , confusion sometimes results , especially since the borrowed English @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chicanos , for instance , have taken to using embarrassar to mean " embarrass , " which is what happens when that word is mistaken for embarazar , a Spanish word that sounds the same but means " to become pregnant . " Moreover , many U.S. Hispanics have grown up hearing so much Spanglish that they are not sure which words are really English . Says Pedro Pedraza of the Puerto Rican studies department at Manhattan 's Hunter College : " I 've heard of Puerto Rican kids asking their parents how to say ' ice cream ' in English .
