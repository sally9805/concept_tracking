The worldwide market for airliners between now and the year 2001 is expected to be an astronomical $280 billion . To snare a hefty share of it , aircraft builders Boeing and McDonnell Douglas are scrambling to roll out new jets that are bigger , quieter and more fuel efficient . <P> The most radical departure is the propeller-driven craft that McDonnell Douglas has demonstrated for customers for the first time . The plane 's engine , built by General Electric , contains jet turbines that drive two counter- rotating sets of stubby propeller blades . The new engine , to be put in use by 1992 , is as powerful as a conventional jet , but is quieter and saves as much as 40% on fuel consumption . <P> Boeing is introducing new versions of its most popular models , the 737 short-range craft and the 747 jumbo jet . The 747-400 will be the world 's largest airliner , capable of carrying as many as 660 passengers . Boeing already has 118 orders for the jumbo at about $175 million apiece .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
