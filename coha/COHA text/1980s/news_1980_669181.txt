His words rebounded around the world . To the white minority rulers of the Republic of South Africa they are like music . For four years , the government here has chafed under President Jimmy Carter ' s criticism of racial discrimination. // Now the South African government sees in the election of Ronald Reagan a possible entree back into the Western world. // In the wake of the US election , the Johannesburg Afrikaans-language newspaper Beeld  --  mouthpiece of the ruling National Party  --  prophesied that : // " South Africa can use the Reagan years to advantage by making our energy supply to a hungry West indispensable ; we must hammer loud and long upon the strategic importance of South Africa in military terms and with regard to raw materials that are essential for military and industrial uses ; we must offer our contribution as fighter of Russian expansionism ; and we must encourage the new US government to chase the Cubans out of Africa. . . " // So begins a new chapter in South African  --  and US  --  diplomacy . South Africa will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the new administration in Washington. // The US , in turn , will be faced with a peculiar problem  --  whether to draw closer to a mineral-rich , militarily powerful , vehemently anticommunist regime at the risk of bringing harsh criticism and even economic retaliation from much of the third world. // The US has always had a somewhat ambivalent relationship with South Africa . The US State Department has denounced South Africa ' s racial discrimination as " one of the cruelest forms of human-rights abuse in the world today . " Yet the US maintains full diplomatic relations with Pretoria , and US corporate investment in the country totals more than $1. 8 billion. // The Carter administration managed to deflect much of the criticism of this policy , largely due to the personal diplomacy of former United Nations Ambassador Andrew Young and his successor , Donald McHenry , and to the strong human-rights stance of the Presidnt himself. // It is likely that future years would have forced a major reassessment of US policy toward South Africa , however , as the demands of black Africa for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ South Africa itself grew more polarized and violent. // Now making that reassessment falls to an incoming Reagan administration  --  and it will not be an easy task. // On the one hand , there is substantial evidence that the South African government ' s racial policies do not have the support of the majority of the population , Pretoria ' s claims to the contrary notwithstanding . Institutionalized racial discrimination still permeates virtually every facet of South African life . Western notions of civil liberties and due process have been buried under so-called " security " legislation , and warrantless arrests and detentions without trial have become commonplace. // On the other hand , the white government controls what is undeniably a treasure trove of minerals  --  a trove on which the US and its Western allies have become heavily reliant . Further , South Africa ' s position at the southern tip of Africa gives it a certain strategic importance in the subcontinent , not only in military , but also in economic and political terms . And its position between two oceans and alongside one of the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an inherent maritime importance. // But just how important is South Africa to the United States and the West ? Moreover , what policies should the US follow to ensure continued access to South Africa ' s mineral wealth , its harbors , its corridors of power ? What are the countervailing Soviet Designs on southern africa , and how should they influence American policy ? // Any assessment of the West ' s strategic stake in South Africa must start with this country ' s mineral wealth . That wealth is so staggering that terms such as " the Persian Gulf of minerals " are hardly overblown. // Some key statistics : // * In 1979 , South Africa produced more than $7 billion worth of gold . Its mines employed tens of thousands of people from seven countries , pumping millions of dollars into the economies of neighboring nations. // * South Africa accounts for one-fifth of the Western world ' s total uranium exports . Uranium is , of course , essential for nuclear power production. // * Some estimates say that during the 1980s , South Africa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an increasingly important energy mineral. // All of these riches come from a country that occupies less than 0. 8 percent of the earth ' s land area. // Impressive as these statistics are , critics point to another side of them . The US and other Western countries are no longer on the gold standard and have resisted efforts to remonetize the precious metal . Uranium demand across much of the industrialized world is falling , as nations ponder the safety of nuclear power and seek alternative energy sources . And the US has substantial reserves of coal  --  by some estimates , one-third of the world total. // But South Africa has something neither the US nor its allies possess  --  an abundance of so-called strategic minerals . These include : // * Chromium . A key element in stainless steel , chromium is essential for production of a wide variety of implements  --  from hospital equipment to gun barrels to jet engines . There is no known substitute for chromium and little likelihood of finding one. // The US imports some 90 percent of its chromium needs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Africa . According to various estimates , South Africa alone has between 68 and 81 percent of world chromite ore reserves . If the higher estimate ( that of the South African government ) is accepted , that amounts to a 934-year supply at current production levels. // Dr. Earl Parker of the University of California at Berkeley says . " The US is strategically more vulnerable to a long-term chromium embargo than to an embargo of any other natural resources , including petroleum. " // * Manganese . Manganese is vital in the production of many steel alloys , and South Africa claims to have some 78 percent of the world ' s reserves . ( US sources place the figure somewhat lower , at about 53 percent . Nevertheless , there is widespread agreement that the South African reserves are substantial. ) // South Africa ' s manganese production , currently pegged at 55 percent of the Western world ' s total , provides the Us with about one-third of its imports of that metal. // As with chromium , the US is heavily dependent on imports of manganese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countries . And that worries some analysts , since without manganese the US steel industry  --  and US weapons producers  --  might face serious problems. // E.F. Andrews , vice-president of Allegheny-Ludlum Industries , says simply , " If you can ' t get manganese , you can ' t make steel. " // * Platinum . Vital as a catalyst in the oil refining process , platinum is also a key element in the catalytic converters that limit emission of pollutants in exhaust gases from American cars. // The US imports about 91 percent of its platinum needs , and currently about 55 percent of US imports come from South Africa . South Africa has between 54 and 75 percent of world reserves. // South Africa also provides about three-quarters of American vanadium imports and plays a role in supplying another extremely important mineral , cobalt , to the US. // At present , the US is dependent on Zaire  --  a central African country perpetually on the brink of bankdruptcy  --  for over 40 percent of its cobalt . And virtually all of Zaire ' s cobalt exports are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ports. // In some cases , US allies are just as dependent on South Africa for strategic minerals . West Germany , for example , gets over 50 percent of its manganese imports from South Africa . Britain is dependent on South Africa for some 75 percent of its chromium imports. // " It ' s very evident that we are one of the top mineral-producing countries in the world , " says Dr. Dirk Neething , director of energy for the South African Department of Mineral and Energy Affairs. // Moreover , South Africa ' s role as a major mineral supplier is likely to grow . This country uses domestic coal for some three-quarters of its energy requirements , and thus can transport and process its raw materials at substantially lower costs than countries that depend on imported oil for such tasks. // Consequently , South Africa is placing greater stress on the further processing of raw materials and is intent on becoming a major supplier of ferromanganese and ferrochromium ( minerals alloyed with iron ) . In addition , South Africa is quietly starting to produce cobalt as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind-the-scenes urging of the US , which is worried about the precarious finances and stability of Zaire ) . // All of this is enough to establish a certain degree of strategic importance for South Africa . But there is another important reason : The other major holder of several strategic minerals is the Soviet Union. // For example , the Soviet Union and South Africa together account for between 82 and 94 percent of the world ' s manganese reserves , 93 percent of its vanadium and some 90 percent of its platinum. // There is little likelihood the two countries would form a minerals cartel . After all , South Africa is bitterly opposed to communism and fears the Soviets may work through its restive black population to overthrow the white government. // Some Western analysts share such fears . They argue that should South Africa ' s mineral wealth fall under Soviet control  --  either directly or through the installation of a black puppet government  --  the West could be held to ransom over strategic minerals. // Backers of this view cite the so-called Lagovsky theory , named @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the West ' s reliance on imported minerals , notably chromium , should be exploited to undermine its warmaking capability. // There are some indications the Soviets already have dabbled in mineral price manipulation . Some analysts claim that in 1978 the Soviets began buying up cobalt on world markets . Shortly afterward , guerrillas from Angola  --  a Soviet client state  --  invaded Zaire ' s Shaba Province , the source of much of the Western world ' s cobalt . When production halted and the price of cobalt skyrocketed , the Soviets then reportedly sold the mineral to Western countries at premium prices. // More recently , some experts have suggested that the intervention of Libya , a Soviet ally , in the civil war in Chad may be a grab for Chad ' s uranium resources. // But some people argue that Soviet price manipulations may not even be the issue. // Dr. Michael Hough , director of the Institute for Strategic Studies at the University of Pretoria , suggests that the ultimate Soviet goal may be " strategic denial "  --  the refusal to sell minerals to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the South African Institute of International Affairs , says , however , that the " strategic denial " theory remains " just speculation. " // " I ' ve never seen any serious indications that that ' s what the Soviets are trying to do , " he adds. // The Soviets have been involved in some unusual activity in the minerals field in recent years , however. // Daniel I. Fine , a resources consultant at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , notes that beginning 1976 , the Soviet Union started major cutbacks on chromium exports . In 1977 , it did the same with platinum . By the following year , its manganese exports had been cut , and Soviet satellite states began shopping on the world market. // " The implications of this development for the US and the alliance are deeply disturbing to conventional assumptions of defense and economic security , " he adds. // Some observers argue that the Soviets may be stockpiling for war , while others say that their new mineral import dependency may well make the Soviets more aggressively acquisitive  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as southern Africa. // But the truth may be far less dramatic , suggests Phillips Purdy , vice-president of Houston International Minerals Corporation. // " The Russians have the raw materials , but they find it more cost-effective to get them from other nations rather than getting them from their own country , " he says. // " They weren ' t continually developing their own resources , " he explains , " they were mining those resources that had already been discovered and that were handy , and suddenly they ' re running out of them. // " So in the meantime , " he concludes , " they ' ve had to go out on the open market and buy . It ' s basic shortsightedness and economics. " // Efforts have been made to insulate US defense needs from minerals cutoffs and disruptions in the marketplace . Since the end of World War II , the US has systematically stockpiled some 93 strategic minerals , metals , and other materials with a 1978 value of $9. 4 billion. // Some stockpile goals have yet to be met @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and kind , of materials that should make up the US stockpile. // Nevertheless , a researcher who has just completed an exhaustive study of South Africa ' s minerals  --  Peter Vale , a lecturer in international relations at Johannesburg ' s University of the Witwatersrand  --  says , " The US , it seems to me , hs enough stockpiles to get by , somehow , for three to five years. " // But , he adds , " Your allies have virtually none. " // The costs of accumulating stockpiles would , by most estimates , be substantial . One estimate is that for West Germany to amass a 97-day stockpile of chrome , the cost would be 300 million deutsche marks ( approximately $156 million ) . The price tag for a six-month cobalt stockpile for Britain is pegged at about 31 million ( $76 million ) . // A recent US Library of Congress study concluded that an interruption of South African mineral supplies " would not spell disaster " for either the US or its Western allies. // But Mr. Vale points out that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Western allies do shape up as an important US foreign policy concern. // " If Reagan is serious about his promises to keep the alliance together , he is going to have to give attention to this fact , " he observes // Similarly , experts point out that the US must be cautious in its approach to the question . If South Africa became convinced that Western countries were building up stockpiles in preparation for economic sanctions against this country , they say , it could theoretically cut back exports and drive prices to prohibitively high levels. // That is no a move Pretoria would take lightly , since it would undercut this country ' s carefully sculpted image as a reliable supplier and could give greater urgency to moves to lessen Western dependence on this country . Still , exports of chrome and manganese account for less than 5 percent of South Africa ' s mineral export earnings. // As one high-ranking official here says , South Africa ' s strategic minerals " are much more important to our customers than they are to us. " // Would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threat to the present political order ? // South African Prime Minister Pieter W. Botha makes it clear such a move has not been ruled out by Pretoria ' s strategists. // " America , Western Europe , and Japan are highly dependent on the strategic mineral imports from South Africa , " he says. // " If economic sanctions are applied against us , we shall not only fight against it , we shall take steps which will demonstrate the folly of sanctions against South Africa. " // Next : South Africa ' s maritime significance// //
