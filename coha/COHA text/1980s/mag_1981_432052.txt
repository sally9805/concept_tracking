 | John McEnroe was getting in some preU.S . Open practice last week with Jimmy Connors , in the company of a handful of spectators and the customary fleet of noisy airplanes that swoop over the Flushing Meadow courts as they approach the nearby New York airports . Often the planes annoyed McEnroe and he mis-hit his meaningless practice shots . Once he reacted by hurling a ball as high as he could , as if hoping to dent some offending 727 . At another point he stopped playing and turned his angry face upward . " Shut up ! " he screamed at the sky . John McEnroe Jr. , Wimbledon and U.S. champion and perhaps the greatest tennis player in the world at the moment , appeared to be serious . This is the McEnroe way . In the narrow world of big-time tennis , he may be lord of the skies ? as well as the hard-rock courts of Flushing and the grass of Wimbledon that he wrested this summer , almost blade by blade , from the steely grip of Bjorn Borg . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rules by rage . He seeks no peace in his kingdom . Magic : It is tempting to describe Mac with the Kris Kristofferson lyric : " A walking contradiction , partly truth and partly fiction . " He is a young man who raises perfectly placed ground strokes to a high art form , only to resort to on-court tantrums that smear his masterpieces like graffiti . His touch and spin are nothing short of magic , capable of enthralling huge and even hostile crowds under high-pressure conditions ; but he meets a stranger one-on-one with a bum-@# bling shyness that borders on rudeness . He is blessed with as much natural ability as anyone who ever played his game , but he is cursed with a perpetual pouting expression that seems to deny the very joy that he is capable of producing . Surely it all adds up to a torn and complex character , boiling with talents and emotions that can barely be understood , much less controlled . But like many aspects of McEnroe , the apparent complexity may be illusory . People who know and like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is modest , funloving , generous and loyal to those he trusts and feels comfortable around . People who dislike him see another form of simplicity : he does what he damn well pleases , no matter what assorted tennis officials , journalists and other designated betes noires may expect of him . Among his defenders and even some of his enemies , one theme is frequently heard . " Whatever else he may be , Mac is true to himself . " True to himself . The phrase may be worth recalling while watching McEnroe defend his U.S. Open title beginning this week at Flushing Meadow . As he slashes toward a new place in history as the first man to win three straight U.S. titles in 60 years , Mac may shock , outrage or dazzle . But love him or hate him , what you see will be the genuine , unadorned John McEnroe . For better or worse , his honesty will be as real as the chip on his broad shoulder . Rock Style : In that light it 's a sure bet that Mac @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think championship tennis should be a gentlemen 's game ? any more than he toned down his punk-rock style to suit the chamber-music enthusiasts who run Wimbledon . He will remain , in the jargon of his supporters , a " perfectionist " who " does n't suffer fools gladly . " Critics may wonder how a 22-year-old s with a year 's college education can so confidently judge the foolishness of those around him . The answer lies in McEnroe 's simple approach . He has arranged his life like a pickup soccer game , choosing up sides and huddling his lonely legion of mates in a select group . It includes his close-knit family , childhood and tennis friends and a handful of journalists who ignore his behavior amid full-throated cheers for his greatness . Recent columns disqualified this writer from that squad . So when NEWSWEEK approached Mac last week his response was , among other things , true to himself . " How can you put someone on the cover without his permission ? " McEnroe demanded . " What do you want to know ? The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Then , after a pause , " I 've got a lot of interesting things to say . I just do n't want to say them in public . " Fortunately , there is a large and fascinat-@# @#  | ing public record of the wit , wisdom and tennis of John McEnroe . In a pro career spanning three years , McEnroe has found time to lose what may have been the best match of all time ? featuring his courageous duel through a 34-point tie breaker with Borg at Wimbledon in 1980 . A year earlier at the Open he won what was probably the worst match ever ? after he and Ilie Nastase disrupted and delayed it in a monumental battle of temper and arrogance . Between those extremes , Mac has forged a chronicle of excellence and histrionics that most players could n't approach in a lifetime on the courts . John McEnroe Sr. , a partner in a large and prestigious New York law firm , spends a good deal of time making a defense case for his son 's behavior . One of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a major talent and he deserves much more attention to that and much less to his temper , " says the senior McEnroe . " If he plays a great five-hour match , even if he behaves at his worst he may take four or five minutes of people 's time . More often he 'll just make some fleeting protest . But that 's what people will talk about , instead of the hours of fine tennis . " Antics : In the wake of some of McEnroe 's most towering tantrums and insensitive insults , that line of reasoning may smack of asking , " Aside from that , Mrs. Lincoln , how did you enjoy the play ? " But in many cases , Mac 's father has a point . Fans and officials anticipate his antics and often overreact , even when he is berating no one but himself for a poor play . The fact is that when his racket is in @#  | motion in lieu of his mouth , McEnroe blends art and ability into displays that are as exhilaratingly innovative as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him a dazzling quick-change artist . One moment he is the relentless slugger , riving his rival from the base line with his punishing serve . Suddenly he is a chess master , luring his victim into an elaborate trap on one sideline only to checkmate him with a perfect drop shot at the other . Then , perhaps most enthusiastically , he becomes the classic New York con man ? the guy who can always come up with the angles . Struggle : At this point , McEnroe 's single Wimbledon triumph must be measured against Borg 's five straight championships there . But Mac is two up on Borg in U.S. Open titles , partly because Bjorn always seems a bit out of sorts amid the bright lights and hectic atmosphere of the New York tournament . More important , McEnroe has not yet matched Borg 's icy steadiness over a period of years . So , McEnroe and Borg will probably battle across several more seasons for their places in history ? and fashion many more brilliant moments in the process . There is no doubt about one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tennis purists , McEnroe will never accede to anyone 's suggestion that he comport himself " more like Bjorn . " As his father says , " We do n't suggest that anybody should try to be John . And nobody has the right to say he should be Bjorn . Individuals are entitled to react in their own ways to stressful situations . And to me , Bjorn 's way is more of an aberration than John 's . " If there is a clue to McEnroe 's lofty achievements ? or stormy outbursts ? in his background , it is hard to find . This was no tennis brat , weaned with a racket and driven through endless practices by stage parents . Nor was he particularly spoiled or coddled by family or friends , even when his precocious skills became evident . John was lust a middle-class kid from Queens who loved sports and happened to be very good at them ? so good that his talents probably exposed him to public scrutiny well before his shy personality was ready for it . McEnroe happened to be born @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Air Force officer . But for most of their lives John and Kay McEnroe have raised their three sons in pleasant surroundings in Douglaston , about half an hour from Manhattan . John showed extraordinary coordination as an infant , swatting a plastic ball with a tiny bat at the age of 2 . At 8 he took his first group-tennis lessons . After eight weeks the local pro gave him a special award and told the group , " We 'll see him at the U.S. Open someday . " But John was hardly an instant prodigy . He gave almost as much time to soccer and basketball as he did to tennis ? and he figures that eventually helped the tennis . " I think it 's wrong to play too much when you 're young , " he has said . " You can burn yourself out . " Even when John began blasting through various age-group tournaments , education and a well-rounded life remained part of the family plan for him . " John was raised under relatively strict standards , " says his father . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rules to follow , high expectations in many areas . We were stricter than many parents I know . And we were probably stricter with John than we were later with his brothers . " ( Mark , 19 , is now a Stanford sophomore ; Patrick is 15 and a promising player on the junior circuit . ) " We 're proud of our children . We have no apologies to make . " For John 's high school , the McEnroes chose the conservative , expensive Trinity School in Manhattan . As the only kid commuting from Douglaston , John often left home at 7 a.m. and returned at 7 p.m. ? after his various sports activities were completed . " We kidded that he was our Queens punk ? real rowdy , " recalls one schoolmate . " He was funny and witty and he 'd try almost any prank . " He also managed to do well in class and play four years of soccer , two of junior varsity basketball ? and four of unbeatable tennis . Like his neighborhood friends and others who learned with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mac 's school teammates emphasize his regularguy modesty . " I especially admired him because he continued to play our team matches even when he was climbing in the rankings , " says Tory Kiam , who played a distant No. 2 behind John . " And he was shy about his tennis . We 'd ask him about some big tournament he 'd played and he would n't say very much . " McEnroe also showed his schoolmates a brand of sportsmanship that coexists with his temper and remains a part of his game . Even in his darkest moods , he tends to rant as furiously when a bad call robs an opponent as he does when he is the victim . He frequently " gives back " such ill-gotten gains . In school , Kiam recalls , " he would win so easily that no one really understood how good he was . But he would never beat anyone love and love , even when he could have . He 'd let a set go to 2-all , for example , so as not to humiliate the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John had collected an array of national junior singles and doubles titles . Then , at 18 , he qualified for Wimbledon and became the youngest male ever to reach the semifinals , where he finally bowed to the seasoned Connors . Even as his friends exulted for him , McEn- roe seemed understandably unsure of how to react . It was the beginning of the long and uneasy relationship with Wimbledon that was to explode amid what should have been his ultimate triumph this year . Standards : " Even after that Wimbledon , there was never really a question about whether John would go to Stanford , " says John McEnroe Sr. Certainly the school had no questions about accepting him : in addition to his tennis reputation , he boasted solid Trinity grades and high Scholastic Aptitude Test scores , particularly in math . No one expected him to endure more than a year of college before turning full time to the game that would make him a millionaire . But he made it a memorable year . Stanford acquaintances remember Mac as a kind of primitive , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rules and set his own standards . His table manners became legend . " Appalling , " says Robert Polhemus , chairman of the English department . " He never shut his mouth until the food dripped out . " Mac 's friends joked that they 53  | could always spot the place at the table where he had eaten . And many cringed at his habit of dumping ice into milk and beer . John had early problems with press representatives . " He was generally surly and a pain to deal with , " says one school publicist . Nancy Peterson , who worked in the Stanford publicity department at the time , recalls , " You could address him and never get a response . It was very uncomfortable . " One teacher got a similar impression , noting that McEnroe always found racket control much easier than eye contact : " When he talked with you , he scratched his head , his chest and his legs rather than look at you . He was a very high-strung , tense person . " It was only around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the best team player I 've ever seen , " says Stanford coach Dick Gould . " He was the one who consoled the guy who lost . He boosted the team with his spirit . " He is also boosting it with his bankroll . Last week he donated what officials call a " significant " sum to a tennis scholarship fund , and he will play an exhibition late this month to help raise $100,000 for the program . Pro Challenge : After winning the intercollegiate singles title as a freshman and leading his team to the over-all championship , McEnroe was ready for the pro challenge . He did n't need advanced math to figure out how much prize money he would have forfeited by staying in school . " I wished that he could have had a normal college career , " said his mother , Kay . " But in my heart I knew he was too talented to wait . " Restless and eager , McEnroe waited for no one . Within months , he thrashed Borg on his home ground in Stockholm . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ triumph in six years . He beat Arthur Ashe to win the Grand Prix Masters and push his half-year earnings toward half a million . At 19 he was fourth in the computerized world rankings . And rising . The U.S. Open was the next major target to fall to McEnroe . Then all that remained were Borg and Wimbledon ? names that had become entwined over the years , names that had to be faced by any pretender to the pinnacle of tennis . For McEnroe the names had special significance . Borg , he heard all too many times , symbolized all the poise and dignity that Mac lacked ; stately Wimbledon was just the kind of place to make a brawling New Yorker feel unappreciated . First there was the tie-breaker match of 1980 . That is the only way it will ever be described in tennis . McEnroe took the opening set with a blinding flash of power . But Borg took command of the next two and seemed on his way to victory as the fourth-set tie breaker began . That was when Wimbledon learned about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Superbrat " was too immature to handle extreme pressure , they were rudely awakened . McEnroe stared at seven match points in the set , survived them all and finally took the set . He succumbed in the fifth set , 8-6 , but the defeat clearly altered his reputation . " I 've had a lot of problems with the fans , " he said . " But this match is kind of a new start . " For some athletes things might have proceeded smoothly from there . But as his friends have noticed , smooth going makes Mac itch . So by the time he returned to Wimbledon this summer , he seemed determined to reduce that hostile ground to chaos . In his first match he called the umpire " an incompetent fool . " In doubles against the Amritraj brothers of India , he reacted to an obviously incorrect call by a beturbaned linesman by saying , " That was an Indian call . " Contrary to London press accounts , it was a thoughtless gibe , not a sign of prejudice ; McEnroe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play an exhibition in South Africa , needs no defense on that score . But the incident did serve to heighten the tension around him . Tempests : Like many of the tempests of tennis , McEnroe 's Wimbledon often dissolved into silly slapstick . When the Fleet Street rumormongers got word of the shaky state of Mac 's romance with longtime friend Stacy Margolin , 22 , who also plays on the pro circuit , they baited him mercilessly . He stormed out of a press conference ? leaving a British gossip seeker and an angry American reporter grappling ludicrously in his wake . The final tally : a $1,500 fine for his first match , which he paid ? and recom-@# mendations by Wimbledon officials that he be fined $13,250 more by the Pro Council . A decision on those fines is expected this week . Oh yes , there was one more result : McEnroe won the tournament . The brilliant , long-awaited triumph over Borg was followed by some fitting social contretemps . McEnroe did n't feel like sitting through a stuffy formal champion 's dinner as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked if John could just show up to make his speech . He also asked if he could bring two close friends who were visiting from Ireland . If Mac 's choice of pizza over pomp and circumstance was typical of his self-absorption , the response was as stiff as British tradition itself . No guests were welcome , the elder McEnroe was told . And if John could n't be bothered to attend the whole dinner the invitation was respectfully withdrawn . Some respect . Five days later the sce-  | nario was completed . To hardly anyone 's surprise , the All England Club made McEnroe the first men 's singles champion not to be granted honorary membership . This was what McEnroe had brought to Wimbledon ; an unsightly duel of extremes , puerile boorishness against century-old stuffiness . Flagrant Mistakes : But another imprint endured amid the wreckage . McEnroe was serving , down 4-5 and 15-30 , in the pivotal third set . Attacking Borg 's return , he volleyed to the corner . A linesman called the ball good . Replays indicated that he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But the umpire , who is supposed to overrule his crew only on flagrant mistakes , changed this very marginal call . Borg won the point and advanced to double break point . McEnroe wheeled in amazement at the reversal . " He called it in and now you 're calling it out ? " The tension was palpable as the crowd waited for the explosion . It never came . When it counted most , the kid marshaled a control worthy of Borg . He also held his serve and went on to win the match . Last week he considered whether the result had been worth all the furor . The conclusion : " Definitely . There 's no other way to satisfy yourself than to know you could go through all that and still make it . " Now it begins again . On his home grounds , McEnroe should find more calm at the Open . But he will still have to contend with the hearing about his Wimbledon fines , the sometimes unruly New York crowds and himself . He must also hold off not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top Czech Ivan Lendl and his more popular fellow Long Islander , Vitas Gerulaitis . Borg says that he wants his first Open title even more intensely than he sought his sixth Wimbledon . That may not be enough : McEnroe should guard his own turf as zealously as he tore up the enemy ground of Britain . Before that happens viewers are all but certain to be subjected to tantrums and turmoil . McEnroe is sure to berate himself , as he often does on the court , as " a disgrace to mankind " ; the question is who else might become a target . Some Mac-watchers look forward to such possibilities with relish . As Ilie Nastase , whose tennis manners are sometimes outrageous , puts it : " Tennis is very boring when everyone just sit down and be quiet . When we make outbursts , game is less boring . " Davis Cup captain Arthur Ashe , a McEnroe booster , is less sanguine about such tantrums : " I 'd sure hate to see the most talented player I 've ever seen screw up his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not out of the woods yet in terms of his reputation . " Whatever turmoil arises , McEnroe 's friends will continue to see the impulsive gen- erosity , the quiet moments and the simple pleasures of a kid listening to Bruce Springsteen or Eddie Money on his stereo . They may also point to some qualities not always evident in top-level , tax-sheltered tennis , like the patriotism that keeps Mac in the Davis Cup program , which for him is far less lucrative than the pro circuit . Who is the real McEnroe in all of this ? He 'll be found at Flushing Meadow . He 'll be the one who 's pouting , laughing , acting stupid , playing brilliantly , maybe even growing up . Doing pretty much what he pleases . True to himself . @#
