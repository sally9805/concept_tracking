Mondale survives at Dartmouth , but the pack is still baying <P> The debate itself lasted three hours . The debate over who won still rages . <P> No sooner had the eight candidates for the Democratic presidential nomination stopped vying for the attention of TV Talk Show Host Phil Donahue , waving their arms like excited schoolchildren , than their camp followers began vying for the attention of the press to declare victory . <P> " Spectacular ! " crowed James Johnson , Walter Mondale 's acting campaign chairman , relieved that the front runner had not fallen . " It makes Gary Hart the emerging dark-horse candidate , " declared his deputy campaign manager , David Landau . The debate transformed Jesse Jackson from " black candidate " to " national candidate , " claimed Jackson 's national-issues coordinator , Frank Watkins . John Glenn 's organization quickly turned the adulatory reactions of six New Hampshire voters into a radio ad . A little too quickly : the voters ' reactions had been taped before the debate . The ad had to be pulled off the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear winner or loser-unless , as some leading Democrats lamented , it was President Reagan . The debate , sponsored by the House Democratic Caucus , was held on the snow-covered New Hampshire campus of Dartmouth College . For the first 1 Vi hours , all the candidates responded to the evenhanded questioning of ABC Newsman Ted Koppel ( see PRESS ) with measured campaign statements . In the second 1 hours , most were goaded into sharper exchanges by Donahue , who hopped about with his microphone soliciting questions from the audience and throwing in some zingers of his own . <P> For the candidates , many of whom have been laboring in relative obscurity , the debate was an opportunity to define their appeals before a public-television audience of perhaps 10 million . It also gave the pack a chance to test Front Runner Mondale . The most dramatic challenge came at the 21/2-hour mark , when Glenn took to the attack . As Mondale explained how he was going to cut the federal budget deficit , Glenn interjected that Mondale was spouting " the same vague gobbledygook of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " There was n't a single figure attached to that ... " <P> " Hold it , " interrupted Mondale . <P> Glenn charged ahead : " Let me finish . I 'm disgusted and tired of all the vague promises . " Now Mondale got worked up . " Point of personal privilege ! " he shouted . But Glenn would not yield : he blamed the Carter Administration for its " 21% inter est rates " and declared , " That 's why we lost the White House . " Shot back Mondale : " There 's just been about a six-minute speech , all of it baloney . " <P> Mondale had resisted a wide-open debate precisely because he worried about such a confrontation . But most observers agreed that he did not suffer any serious wounds . Said fellow Candidate George McGovern : " It 's clear that Mondale gained more than anyone else from the debate by not being hurt during it . As the front runner going in , all he had to do was not make any mistakes , and he didn't. "  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
