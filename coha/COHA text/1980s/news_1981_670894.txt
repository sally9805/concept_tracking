An interior decorator who must have been told to go heavy on the warmth has riveted a plastic sunflower to the wall at the entrance ; inside , every inch of carpet or wall divider is crimson or rust or orange . A map with colored pins representing the company ' s peep shows , sex shops and movie theaters glows in the lobby. // As a symbol of a marketing theory - the nice-guy approach to selling sex - the building is close to perfect , but not nearly as good as the woman who created and owns it . No one seems better at reassuring clients that buying a pornographic videotape or a vibrator is the most normal thing in the world than Beate Rotermund , known professionally as Beate Uhse , who will begin setting up operations in the United States in March. // // $48. 6 Million in Sales // A sturdy woman of 61 years , Mrs. Rotermund comes bounding downstairs to meet a visitor . She is wearing a blue shirt , white flannel slacks and sneakers , and she is grinning like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sold $48. 6 million in sexual @paraphern@alia in 1980 . That is about five times the business done by Pleasure Chest Ltd. , which describes itself as the largest merchandiser of sex-related products in the United States. // Mrs. Rotermund will begin her American operation by distributing hard-core feature films through an organization she calls Reel Pleasure Unlimited . The novelty of the program is that the 46 movie houses she has linked together are to be equipped with the highest quality stereo sound , and the first film will be given a national advertising campaign. // If the distribution system goes well after two or three years , Mrs. Rotermund said , she would like to begin mail-order businesses in states like California or Florida. // " We ' re coming into the United States very aware of the associations that the sex business has in people ' s minds with organized crime , " she said . " We want to break that association and some of the other taboos . We ' re a good , a nice company , and we treat people well . We think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into America and not to get dirty . " <> <> Former Luftwaffe Pilot // The story of her success - she says a polling organization found that she is the country ' s best-known woman - is at the very least a good sociological footnote in an account of West Germany ' s postwar development. // In April 1945 , at age 25 , Mrs. Rotermund , a Luftwaffe pilot who ferried planes to the Eastern front during World War II , fled from Berlin with an infant son to the area near the Danish border where she still lives . To earn money she began to peddle toys from a bicycle . Then , sensing that there was a demand for the birth-control information suppressed under Hitler ' s rule , she began selling a mimeographed pamphlet on the rhythm method. // By 1951 she had opened a mail-order house that offered a range of explicit sexual material . If life in West Germany after the war retained many of the formalistic and hierarchical aspects of the old system , it also displayed increasingly relaxed sexual attitudes that some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fall of the Nazis . Mrs. Rotermund caught the tide and also a sense that the business would prosper if it could be given a feeling of openness and respectability . <> <> The Presentation of Self // One of Mrs. Rotermund ' s competitors ( she later bought out the company ) decided that its chain of sex shops would show its seriousness by calling itself Dr. Muller ' s . Mrs. Rotermund presented herself as the wholesome mother of three sons. // " Our competition was big at first , " she said , " but everybody involved in it wanted to stay in the shadows . I said , ' I ' m Beate Uhse , and if you want it , we ' re not going to handle it under the table . ' We were always ready to go to court , and we were always ready to give our clients the feeling that they were honorable people dealing with other honorable people. " // The business accelerated significantly with the decriminalization of pornography in 1975 . The Scandinavians were the first to do that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stuff and the product deteriorated . " Her business grew to the point where it now includes 450 employees , a film-distribution company , a lingerie manufacturer , a condom manufacturer and a pharmaceutical concern that turns out a medicine-show variety of unguents , tablets and oils. // At first , she said , her openness brought her a number of personal problems , including the refusal of an application for membership at a tennis club , which seemed to irritate her most . Feminist groups , many of which consider that pornography is essentially exploitation of women , have largely left her alone . <> <> Moral Principle May Run Second // Mrs. Rotermund said she found sexual material involving children and animals awful and would have nothing to do with it . Her business sense , on the other hand , has not always taken second place to her moral notions . When she bought the Dr. Muller stores three years ago , she kept open the leather and whip departments. // " It ' s allowed under the law , " she said . " We looked at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prices and got rid of it all . It wasn ' t worth the effort . We try to offer what the customers like , and as the biggest business of its kind I think we ' ve got an obligation to offer the widest possible choice . We ' ve got something on the order of six million mail-order customers . We sell about one inflatable life-sized doll a month . But we keep it in stock . It ' s a kind of responsibility. " // Mrs. Rotermund laughed . " I ' m not expecting the federal Order of Merit , " she said . " At least not yet. " //
