In an unusual address to a joint session of Congress , Mr. Reagan invoked the memory of the 1947 request by President Harry S. Truman for aid to Greece and Turkey , saying the turmoil in Central America posed a threat to the United States comparable to what it faced in Europe after World War II. // He called on the legislators to set aside " passivity , resignation , defeatism " in facing " this challenge to freedom and security in our hemisphere . " <> <> U.S. Called in Jeopardy // With Congress deeply reluctant to approve his proposed aid package for the region , Mr. Reagan sought to put the sum requested in perspective : He said the $600 million he is asking for Central America for the 1984 fiscal year amounted to " less than one-tenth of what Americans will spend this year on coin-operated video games. " // " The national security of all the Americas is at stake in Central America , " Mr. Reagan said . " If we can not defend ourselves there , we can not expect to prevail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crumble , and the safety of our homeland would be put at jeopardy. " // Mr. Reagan also repeated , with emphasis , his view that the rebellions in El Salvador and other nations in the area are being assisted by Cuba , Nicaragua and the Soviet Union. // He acknowledged there were " still major problems " in El Salvador on human rights and civilian violence , but asserted that the country ' s economy was being " deliberately sabotaged " by Nicaragua to further its aim of exporting revolution in the region. // The President , in effect , submitted a bill of particulars against the Sandinist regime in Nicaragua , which came to power in 1979 . Despite the hopes of many , Mr. Reagan said , the Sandinists had " imposed a new dictatorship " in Nicaragua and had done " everything they can to bring down the elected Government of El Salvador. " // Despite this description of the Nicaraguan Government , Mr. Reagan said " we do not seek its overthrow . " Then , in an apparent reference to reports that the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he declared : " We should not - and we will not - protect the Nicaraguan Government from the anger of its own people . But we should , through diplomacy , offer an alternative . And as Nicaragua ponders its options , we can and will - with all the resources of diplomacy - protect each country of Central America from the danger of war . " <> <> U.S. Role Is Challenged // Thus the President left somewhat ambiguous the nature of American assistance to anti-Sandinist forces while asserting , as he has in the past , that the United States is not violating a law approved last December barring any effort to overthrow the Nicaraguan Government. // Some in Congress , including Representative Edward P. Boland , the Massachusetts Democrat who is chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence , have said the United States may be violating the law in assisting the anti-Sandinist rebels. // Mr. Reagan ' s 34-minute speech marked the first time he had appeared before a joint Congressional session to deal with a foreign policy issue . Despite his appeal for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Republicans alone . Only when the President said there was no need for American troops in Central America did Democrats join in the ovation. // Republican leaders said they had advised against using a joint session for such a speech , but the White House insisted it was the best way to make the public more aware of the President ' s view of the stakes in Central America. // The speech was addressed to the public , on prime-time television , and the fact that it was made before both houses of Congress insured that it would generate continued discussion in the form of newsletters , speeches and direct mailings to constituents. // The President spoke one day after a House Appropriations subcommittee approved $30 million in additional military aid for El Salvador this year , half the amount Mr. Reagan had sought . <> <> Proposal in Trouble // The President ' s emergency package of $298 million in additional military and economic aid for Central America for 1983 is acknowledged by Administration officials to be in trouble among Republicans and Democrats in both houses of Congress. // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relying too heavily on military assistance and overlooking the possibility of political reconciliation through negotiations in El Salvador and elsewhere . Many are also worried that the Administration is conducting a covert program to overthrow the Nicaraguan Government. // Mr. Reagan sought tonight to meet these concerns and also to assure the Congress that he did not foresee any direct United States troop involvement in the region. // " Let me say to those who invoke the memory of Vietnam there is no thought of sending American combat troops to Central America , " Mr. Reagan said . " They are not needed . Indeed , they have not been requested there . All our neighbors ask of us is assistance in training and arms to protect themselves while they build a better , freer life . " <> <> Political Process Supported // The President said his Administration remained committed ultimately to resolving the region ' s differences through the political process and through the encouragement of an accord among all nations in the area that would eventually bar all foreign troops and advisers as well as military intervention in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assurances " that Administration officials said were designed to please members of Congress who have worried that Mr. Reagan is not paying enough attention to resolving the region ' s problems diplomatically. // First , Mr. Reagan said the United States would support " any agreement " among Central American countries leading to the withdrawal of all foreign advisers and troops . Second , he pledged " to help opposition groups join the political process in all countries. " // Third , he said he would support " any verifiable , reciprocal agreement " renouncing support of insurgencies in neighboring countries . Fourth , he said he would support any accord " on the nonimportation of offensive weapons . " <> <> Special Envoy to Be Named // As expected , Mr. Reagan also announced that he would soon appoint a special envoy to the region to be approved by the Senate to help carry out this process of political reconciliation . He did not name the envoy , but Administration officials said that former Senator Richard Stone , a Florida Democrat , was a leading contender . However , Republican @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because of opposition that had developed among Democrats. // In a briefing for reporters , Administration officials said Mr. Reagan ' s assurances on diplomatic and political actions did not mark a shift in United States policy . Specifically , they said , it did not change the Administration ' s position that armed rebels in El Salvador should not be able to circumvent the electoral process to gain power. //
