' ' Look , George Shultz has made me a real person , ' ' laughs an official of the Palestine Liberation Organization ( PLO ) , holding out his arms. // In this tranquil Arab capital , the sudden United States decision to open a dialogue with the PLO has generated relief and excitement. // // But in a noisome Palestinian refugee camp 20 miles away , where the grinding realities of life smother such enthusiasm , upbeat responses to the US decision are in shorter supply. // ' ' Sure , I guess it ' s a good thing , ' ' says the matron of a family who has been shuttled through five refugee camps since fleeing Israel in 1948 . ' ' But if someone has taken your land , how can you be happy ? ' ' // ' ' If America had really wanted peace before now , it could have had it , ' ' adds a Palestinian doctor , a refugee from Ramle , near Tel Aviv . ' ' The problem is that America didn ' t believe in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convinced that America really wants a fair peace. ' ' // Between these extremes , a cautious optimism , a hope tinged with realism , has settled over the Arab world as a new phase in Arab-Israeli relations begins. // ' ' It was so wrong to pretend that 6 million people didn ' t exist . Now people can talk to each other , ' ' says a Jordanian official , who cried openly when he heard of the US decision . ' ' If this is genuine , I think it will open many new avenues to peace. ' ' // ' ' This is just excellent , ' ' echoes another Jordanian official with a sigh of relief. // The journalist , who is Palestinian-born , cautions : ' ' It gives great hope . But it also raises expectations so high . The US has now recognized the PLO ; it will be much harder to get the Americans to recognize Palestinian rights to self-determination. ' ' // Neither does the US decision necessarily presage US recognition of the Palestinian state declared last month by the Palestine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , other Arab sources point out . Secretary of State Shultz said in his Wednesday announcement that the US did not recognize the declared Palestinian state , though that would be a topic of future discussion. // ' ' It was not an objective by itself for the Americans to take a position to talk to us , ' ' says Ibrahim Abu Ayash , a member of the PNC . But ' ' if the step had not been taken it would have been a disaster for the peace process. ' ' // Government and private analysts here speculate that the moderate tone of Yasser Arafat ' s address before the United Nations General Assembly was one factor but not the most important factor prompting the sudden US turnabout. // Another was concern over the US ' s growing diplomatic isolation as country after country , including key US allies like Britain , became convinced of the sincerity of Mr. Arafat ' s recent peace overtures. // Most important were warnings from key Arab leaders of what the US position was doing to undermine moderates , both within the PLO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delivered a warning personally in a highly unusual telephone appeal to Mr. Shultz from Cairo on Wednesday. // A PLO official , Asad Abdul-Rahman , notes that without the US decision to talk to the PLO , Arafat would have been the target of intense criticism . Radical elements within the PLO would have blamed him for having gambled and lost in his ploy to win Western backing with a program of political compromises , including recognizing Israel , embracing UN Resolutions 242 and 338 , and renouncing terrorism. // With Washington ' s decision to open a dialogue with the PLO , Arafat has clearly demonstrated the diplomatic utility of the PLO ' s softer line. // One result : Arafat ' s stature has been enhanced enormously . Thus the role of Arab governments , on which the PLO chairman has been so heavily dependent for so many years , will be ' ' marginalized , ' ' says a Palestinian source . ' ' They will now have to follow the lead of the PLO. ' ' // One concern expressed here is that extremist elements might initiate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - to throw the pending US-PLO dialogue off track. // But PLO sources say that despite pockets of internal resistance , confined to extremists like Syrian-backed PLO renegade Abu Musa , Arafat will now be able to press ahead with a solid mandate within the PLO. // For one thing , these sources say , Arafat ' s Geneva remarks did not go beyond the consensus position hammered out at the recent PNC meeting in substance. // Yet they did clarify that position - thereby winning US support . In a press conference Wednesday , Arafat said the PLO ' ' totally and absolutely ' ' renounces all forms of terrorism and recognizes Israel ' s right to live in peace and security . // ' ' Arafat can now go forward , and those who matter inside the PLO will go definitely and solidly behind him , ' ' says Dr. Abdul-Rahman , a member of the PLO ' s Central Committee . ' ' Some will make ( negative ) statements , but just for the record , they will not matter . ' ' <> <> Arafat ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was established in 1964 to act as a quasi-governmental body for the Palestinian diaspora. // After the 1967 Arab-Israeli war , the PLO adopted a stance favoring guerrilla activities against Israel ; insisted upon greater independence from Arab states ; and , for the first time , called for the establishment of a Palestinian state in which Muslims , Christians , and Jews would have equal rights. // Over the decades , it has splintered into at least eight factions over differences in aims and tactics. // Yasser Arafat , who was elected PLO chairman in 1969 , heads the largest faction , the mainstream Al-Fatah . Fatah and two other factions - the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine , led by George Habash , and the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine , led by Nayef Hawatmeh - make up about 80 percent of the PLO ' s strength. // Both the PFLP and the DFLP are backed by Syria - which staunchly opposes the idea of concessions to Israel ' s existence . In February 1987 , Syrian forces reportedly raided the Damascus offices of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' s bloc. // Dr. Habash ' s PFLP , the most influential group after Fatah , aims for a Palestinian nation founded on socialist and Marxist principles . Responding to the US ' s willingness to talk with the PLO , Habash said : ' ' Although the US says that initiating the dialogue does not entail recognition of Palestinian rights to . . . an independent state , we still welcome the latest development. ' ' // Six other PLO splinter groups form the Palestine National Salvation Front . The front was created in March 1985 , a month after Jordan ' s King Hussein and Arafat signed an accord to jointly work toward Arab-Israeli peace . ( Hussein later anulled the accord . ) Included in this group are Palestinian leaders such as Abu Musa and Abul Abbas who are sought in connection with various terrorist hijackings and killings. // //
