 | " So I should , but I had more than I could properly absorb last night and there were points that escaped me . I am an investigator and not an infallible conipntcr . " Fastolfe said , " I was not imputing blame . It 's just that I hate to see Cladia unnecessarily disturbed . In view of what you told me last night , I can only assiiiuc she mist he in a state of deep distress . " " Undoubtedly . But she is also desperately anxious to find out what happened  --  who , if anyone , killed the one she viewed as her husband . That 's understandable , too . I 'm sure she 'll be willing to help me . ? And I wish to speak to another person as well . " " To whom ? " " To your daughter Vasilia . " " To Vasilia ? Why ? What purpose will that serve ?

" Dr. Fastolfe , once again I must remind you that I am here at your request . I have no formal authority to do police work . I have no connection with any Aurorae authorities . The only chance I have of getting to the bottom of this miserable mess is to hope that various people will voluntarily cruipecate with me and answer my questions . " If you stop me from attempting this , then it is clear that I can get no farther than I am right now , which is nowhere . It will also look extremely bad for von and therefore for Earth  --  so I urge you not to stand in niv way . If von make it possible for me to interview anyone I wish or even simply try to make it possible by interceding on my behalf  --  then the people of Aurora will surely consider that to be a sign of self-conscious innocence on your part . If you hamper my investigation , on the other hand , to what conclusion can they come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fastolfe said , with poorly suppressed annoyance , " I understand that , Mr. Baley . But why Vasilia ? There are other roboticists . " " Vasilia is your daughter . She knows you . She might have  | Strang opinions concerning the likelihood of your destroying a mlx-t . Since she is a member of the Robotics institute and on fir side of your political enemies , any favorable evidence she n-av give would be persuasive . " And it she testifies against me ? " " We 'll face that when it comes . Would you get in touch with 114.1 and ask her to receive me ? " Fastolfe said resignedly , " I will oblige you , but you are mistaken if you think I can easily persuade her to see you . She may be too busy  --  or think she is . She may be away from Aurora . She may simply not wish to be involved . I tried to explain last night that she has reason  --  thinks she has reason  --  to he hostile to me . My asking her to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a sign of her displeasure with me . " " Would you try , Dr. Fastolfe ? " Fastolfe sighed . " I will try while you are at ( : ladia 's . ? I presume you wish to see her directly ? I might point out that a trimensional viewing would do . The image is high enough in quality so that you will not be able to tell it from personal presence . " " I 'm aware of that , Dr. Fastolfe , but Gladia is a Solarian and has unpleasant associations with trimensional viewing . And , in any case , I am of the opinion that there is an intangible additional effectiveness in being within touching distance . The present situation is too delicate and the difficulties too great for me to want to give up that additional effectiveness . " " Well , I 'll alert Gladia . " He turned away , hesitated , and turned back . " But , Mr. Baley ? " " Yes , Dr. Fastolfe ? " " Last night you told me that the situation was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cause Gladia . There were , you pointed out , greater things at stake . " " That 's so , but you can rely on me not to disturb her if I can help it . " " I am not talking about Gladia now . I merely warn you that this essentially proper view of yours should be extended to myself . I do n't expect you to worry about my convenience or pride if you should get a chance to talk to Vasilia . I do n't look forward  | to the results , but if you do talk to her , I will have to endure any ensuing embarrassment and you must not seek to spare me . Do you understand ? ' " To he perfeetIv hiuest , I ) r . Fastolfe , it was never my attention to spare volt . 11 I have to weigh your embarrassment or shame against the welfare of vow- policies and against the welfare of my would , I would not hesitate a moment to shame you .

" " It was n't allowed to do so when you decided to have me brought here without consulting me . " " I 'm referring to something else . If , after a reasonable time ? not a long time , but a reasonable time  --  you make no progress toward a solution , we will have to . consider the possibilities of psychic-probing , after all . Our last chance might be to find out what it is your mind knows that you do not know it knows . " " It may know nothing , Dr. Fastolfe . " Fastolfe looked at Baley sadly . " Agreed . But , as you said concerning the possibility of Vasilia testifying against me  --  we 'll face that when it comes .

And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Psychic Probe , which could scarcely be better . " jehoshaphat ! " he muttered softly to himself . 33 . The walk to Gladia 's seemed shorter than it had on the day before . The day was sunlit and pleasant again , but the vista looked not at all the same . The sunlight slanted from the opposite direction , of course , and the coloring seemed slightly different . It could be that the plant life looked a hit different in the  | morning than in the evening  --  or smelled different , had , on occasion , thought that of Earth 's plant life as well , bored . Daneel and Giskard accompanied him again , but they titW elect more closely to him and seemed less intensely alert . Raley said idly , " Does the sun shine here all the time ? " " It does not , Partner Elijah , " said Daneel . " Were it to do so , that would be disastrous for the plant world and , therefore , for humanity . The prediction is , in fact , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the day . " " What was that ? " asked Baley , startled . A small arid graybrown animal was crouched in the grass . Seeing them , it hopped away in leisurely fashion . " A rabbit , sir , " said Giskard . Baley relaxed . He had seen them in the fields of Earth , too ) . Gladia was not waiting for them at the door this time , but she was clearly expecting them . When a robot ushered them in , she did not stand up , but said , with something between crossness and weariness , " Dr. Fastolfe told me you had to see me again . What now ? " She was wearing a robe that clung tightly to her body and was clearly wearing nothing underneath . Her hair was pulled back shapelessly and her face was pallid . She looked more drawn than she had the day before and it was clear that she had had little sleep . Daneel , remembering what had happened the day before , did not enter the room . Giskard entered , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ niche . One of Gladia 's robots stood in another niche . Baley said , " I 'm terribly sorry , Gladia , to have to bother you again . " Gladia said , " I forgot to tell you last night that , after Jander is torched , he will , of course , be recycled for use in the robot factories again . It will be amusing , I suppose , to know that each time I see a newly formed robot , I can take time to realize that many of Jander 's atoms form part of him . " Baley said , " We ourselves , when we die , are recycled  --  and  | who knows what atoms of whom are in you and me right now or in whom ours will someday he . " You are very right , Elijah .

Yesterday , you said that even after you were with jander  --  as wife and husband  --  there were men who offered themselves to you and that you refused . It is that which I must question you about . " " Why ? " Raley ignored the question . " Tell n ) e , " he said , " how many men offered themselves to you during the time you were married to jander ? " " I do n't keep records , Elijah . Three or four . " " Were all of then persistent ? Did anyone offer himself more than once ' " ( Nadia , who had heen nvoitlinc , his eves , mow looked at him full and said , " I hive you talked to others about this ? " Balcv shook his head , " I have talked on this subject to no one but you . From @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was at least one who was persistent . " " One . Santirix ( ; remionis , " She sighed . " Aurorans have such peculiar names and he Iru. ' . peculiar  --  for an Auroran . I had never met one as repetitious In the ( natter as he . He was always polite , always accepted my ref sal with a small smile and a stately bow , and then , as like as not , he would try again the next week or even the next day . The mere repetition was a small discourtesy . A decent Aurorae would accept a refusal permanently unless the prospective partner made it reasonably plain there was a change of mind . " " ' fell me again ? Did those who offered themselves to you know of your relationship with jander ? " " It was not something I mentioned in casual conversation . "  | " Well , then , consider this Gremionis , specifically . Did he know that Jai ( ler was your husband ? " " I never told him so . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's not a matter of his being , told . Unlike the others , he offered himself repeatedly . I low often would you say , by the way ? Three times ? Four ? I low many ? " " I did not count , " said Gladia wearily . " It might have been a dozen times or more . If he were n't a likable person otherwise , I would have had my robots bar the establishment to him . " " Ah , but you did n't . And it takes time to make multiple offerings . He came to see you . Ile encountered you . I le had time to note Dander 's presence and how you behaved to hint . Might he not have guessed at the relatinnsliip ? " Gladia shook her head . " I do n't think so . Finder never iiitruded when I was with an iv Innimnaui being . " " Were those your instructions ? 1 presume they mist have if been . " " They were . And before you suggest I was ashamed of the relationship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I have retained some instinct of privacy about sex that Aurorans do n't have . " " Think again . Might he have guessed ? Here he is , a man in love ? " In love ! " The sound she made was almost a snort . " What do Aurorans know of love ? " " A man who considers himself in love . You are not responsive . Might he not , with the sensitivity and suspicion of a disappointed lover , have guessed ? Consider ! Did he ever make any roundabout reference to jander ? Anything to cause you the slightest suspicion ? " " No ! No ! It would be unheard of for any Auroran to comment adversely on the sexual preferences or habits of another . " " Not necessarily adversely . A humorous comment , perhaps . Any indication that he suspected the relationship . " " No ! If young Gremionis had ever breathed a word of that sort , he would never have seen the inside of my establishment  | that age ? Suppose he guessed at your relationship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Might he not , nevertheless , have been jealous ? " " Jealous ? " It occurred to Baley that the word might have little meaning 1.1 on Aurora or Solaria . " Angered that you should prefer another to i ! I himself . " fE ' ' tl Gladia said sharply , " I know the meaning of the word jealous . ' I repeated it only out of surprise that you should think any Auroran was jealous . On Aurora , people are not jealous over sex . Over other things certainly , but not over sex . " There was a definite sneer upon her face . " Even if he were jealous , what would it matter ? What could he do ? . , 11,1 " Was n't it possible he might have told ) antler that the relationship with a robot would endanger volt ' . position on Aurora ? " That would nut have been true ! ..

" Jander would never have believed that He made me happy every day he was my husband and I told him so . " Baley remained calm . She was missing the point , but he would simply have to make it clearer . " I am sure he believed you , but he might also feel impelled to believe someone else who told him the reverse . If he were then caught in an unbearable First Law dilemma ? " Gladia 's face contorted and she shrieked , " That 's mad . You 're just telling me the old fairy tale of Susan Calvin and the mindreading robot . No one over the age of ten can possibly believe that . " " Is n't it possible that ? " again and I would have seen to it that he never approached me again . ? But he would n't have done anything of the sort . He was the soul of eager politeness to inc . " " You say young .

Dr. Fastolfe might be able to do it , but certainly not Santirix Gremionis. - Gremionis is a stylist . Ile works on human beings . He cuts hair , designs clothing . I do the some , hut at least I work on robots . Gremionis has never touched a robot . He knows nothing about them , except to order one to close the window or something like that . Are you trying to tell me that it was the relationship between Jander and melee " ? she tapped herself harshly on the breastbone with one rigid finger , the swells of her small breasts scarcely showing tinder her robe ? " that caused Jander 's death ? " " It was nothing you did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unable to quit probing . " What i ( Gremionis had learned from Dr. Fastolfe how to ? " " Gremionis did n't know 1 ) r . Fastolfe and could n't have understood anything Dr. Fastolfe ( night have told him , anyhow . " " You ca n't know for certain what ( : rencioccis might or might not understand and , as for not knowing Dr. hastolfe  --  Gremionis must have been frequently in your establishment if he hounded you so and ? " " And Dr. Fastolfe was almost never in my establishment . Last night , when he came with you , it was only the second time he had crossed my threshold . He was afraid that to he too close to me would drive me away . He admitted that once . Ile lost his daughter that way , he thought  --  something foolish like that . ? You see , Elijah , when you live several centuries , von have plenty of time to lose thousands of things . lie th-thauckful for short life , Elijah . " She was weeping uncontrollably . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Gladia . I have no more questions . Shall I call a robot ? Will you need help ? " She shook her head and waved her hand at him . " Just go away  --  go away , " she said in a strangled voice . " Go away . " Baley hesitated and then strode out of the room , taking one last , uncertain look at her as he walked out the door . Giskard followed in his footsteps and Daneel joined him as he left the house . He scarcely noticed . It occurred to him , abstractedly , that he was coming to accept their presence as he would have that of  | his shadow or of his clothing , that he was reaching a point where he would feel here without then . He walked rapidly back toward the Fastolfe establishment , his mind churning . His desire to see Vasilia had at first been a matter of desperation , a lack of ; ulv other object of curiosity , but now things had changed . There was just a chance that he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face was set in grim lines when Baley returned . " Any progress ? " he asked . " I eliminated part of a possibility . ? Perhaps . " " Part of a possibility ? How do you eliminate the other part ? Better yet , how do you establish a possibility ? " Baley said , " By finding it impossible to eliminate a possibility , a beginning is made at establishing one . " " And it von find it impossible to eliminate the other part of the possibility oti IIIRSt ( ? riOIINi mentioned ? .. Kiley shrugged . " Before we waste olir tittle considering that , I must see your daughter " Fastolfe looked dejected . " Well , l r. flaky , I did as you asked me to do and tried to contact lie ' . It was necessary to awaken her . " " You mean she is in halt if the planet where it is night ? I had n't thought of that . " Baley felt chagrined . " I 'm afraid I 'm fool enough to imagine I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night lose their meaning and tittle tends to be uniform . " " It 's not that bad . Eos is the robotics center of Aurora and you 'll find few roboticists who live out of it . She was simply sleeping and being awakened slid not improve her temper , apparently . She would not speak to me . " " Call again , " said Baley urgently . " I spoke to her secretarial robot and there was an uncomfortable relaying of messages . She made it quite plain she will not speak to me in any fashion . She was a little more flexible  | with von . The robot announced that she would give you five minutes on her private viewing channel , if you call " ? Fastolfe consulted the time-strip on the wall ? " in half an hour . She will not see you in person under any conditions . " " ' lie conditions are insufficient and so is the time . I must see her in person for as long as is needed . Did you explain the importance of this , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not concerned . " " You are her father . Surely ? " " She is less inclined to bend her decision for my sake than for a randomly chosen stranger . I knew this , so I made use of Giskard . " " Giskard ? " " Oh yes . Giskard is a great favorite of hers When she was studying robotics at the university , she took the liberty o ! Iudjusting some minor aspects of his programming  --  and nothing makes for a closer relationship with a robot than that  --  except for Gladia 's method , of course . It was almost as though Giskard were Andrew Martin ? " " Who is Andrew Martin ? " " Was , not is , " said Fastolfe . " You have never heard of him ? " " Never ! " " How odd ! These ancient legends of ours all have Earth as their setting , yet on Earth they are not known . ? Andrew Martin was a robot who , gradually , step by step , was supposed to have become humaniform . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but they were all simple toys , little more than automatons . Nevertheless , amazing stories are told of the abilities of Andrew Martin  --  a sure sign of the legendary nature of the tale . There was a woman who was part of the legends who is usually known as Little Miss . The relationship is too complicated to describe now , but I suppose that every little girl on Aurora has daydreamed of being Little Miss and of having Andrew Martin as a robot . Vasilia did  --  and Giskard was her Andrew Martin . " " Well , then ? " " I asked her robot to tell her that you would be accompanied  | by Giskard . She has n't seen him in years and I thought that might lure her into agreeing to see you . " " But it did n't , I presume . " " It did n't . " " Then we must think of something else . There must be some way of inducing her to see Inc . " Fastolle said . " Perhaps you will think of one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on trinlensic and you will have five minutes to convince her that she ought to see you personally . " " Five minutes ! What can I do in five minutes ? " " I do n't know . It is better , after all , than nothing . " 3.5 ? Fifteen minutes later , Baley stood before the trimensional viewing screen , ready to meet Vasilia Fastolfe . Dr. Fastolfe had left , saying , with a wry smile , that his presence would certainly make his daughter less amenable to persuasion . Nor was I ) aneel present . Only Giskard remained behind to keep Iialev company . Giskard said , " Dr. Vasilia 's tri-nensic ? channel is open for reception . Are you ready , sir ' ? " " As ready as I can be , " said Raley grimly . He had refused to sit , feeling he might he more imposing if he were standing . ( How imposing could an Ea'thman be ? ) The screen grew bright as the rest of the room dimmed and a woman appeared  --  in rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , her right hand resting on a laboratory bench laden with sets of diagrams . ( No doubt she planned to be imposing , too . ) As the focus sharpened , the edges of the screen seemed to melt away and the image of Vasilia ( if it were she ) deepened and became three-dimensional . She was standing in the room with every sign of solid reality , except that the decor of the room she was in did not match the room Baley was in and the break was a sharp one .  | She was wearing a dark brown skirt that divided into loose taxer legs that were semitransparent , so that her legs , from TnIdthigh clown , were shadowily visible . Her blouse was tight and sleeveless , so that her arms were bare to the shoulder . I Ier neckline was low and her hair , quite blond , was in tight curls . She had none of her father 's plainness and certainly not his large ears . Baley could only assume she had had a beautiful mother and was fortunate in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could see a remarkable resemblance to ( aadia in her facial features , although her expression was far colder and seemed to bear the mark of a dominating personality . She said sharply , " Are you the Earthman come to solve my father 's problems ? " " Yes , Dr. Fastolfe , " said Balev ; III etu ; illy clipped manlier . " You may call me Dr. Vasilia . I do not wish the confusion of ' being mistaken for my father . " " Dr. Vasilia , I must have a chance to deal with you , face-toface , for a reasonably extended period. ? " " No doubt you feel that . You are , of course , an Earthman and a certain source of infection . " " I have been medically treated and I am quite safe to be with . Your father has been constantly with nee for over a day . " " My father pretends to be an idealist and must do foolish things at times to support the pretense . I will not imitate him . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will living hint harm if you refuse to see me . " " You are wasting time . I will not see you , except in this manner , and half the period I have allotted is gone . If you wish , we can stop this now if you find it unsatisfactory . " " Giskard is here , Dr. Vasilia , and would like to urge you to see me . " Giskard stepped into the field of vision . " Good morning , Little Miss , " he said in a low voice . For a moment , Vasilia looked embarrassed and , when she spoke , it was in a somewhat softer tone . " I am glad to view you , Giskard , and will see you any time you wish , but I will not see this Earthman , even at your urging . " Milli AI '  | j " In that case , " said Raley , throwing in all his reserves desper ' 1iq ately , " I must take the case of Santirix Gremionis to the public without the benefit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her hand on the table lifted up I , ; ; ward and clenched into a list , " What is this about Gremionis ' ? " " Only that he is a handsome voting man and he knows you i , li well . Ant I to deal with these matters without hearing what you have to sav ' ' .. " I will tell VIM right now that  --  " Nn , ' ' said Balev loudly . " You will tell me nothing unless I see you face-to-face . " Her mouth twitched . " I will see you , then , but I will not remain with you one moment more than I choose . I warn you . ? And bring Giskard . " The trimensional connection broke off with a snap and Balev felt himself turn dizzy at the sudden change in background that resulted . He made his way to a chair and sat down . C:iskard 's hand was on his elbow , making certain that he reached the chair safely . " Can I help you in any way , sir ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said 14 ; tles , " I just need to catch 111v breath .

" If manners dictate that what you did requires ; tit apology , then I forgive you . " " But what is this about Satitiris ( ; renminnis ? The name is unfajmiliar to me . " Baley looked up at Fastolfe and said , " Dr. Fastolfe , I heard his name from Gladia this morning . I know very little about him , but I took the chance of saying what I did to your daughter anyway . The odds were heavily against me , but the results were what I wanted them to be , nevertheless . As you see , I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have very little information , so you had better leave me in peace to continue to do so . Please , in  | the future , cooperate to the full and make no further mention of II I 's chic Probe ... Fastolfe was silent and Bale ) , felt a grim satisfaction at having imposed his will first on the daughter , then on the father . I low long he could continue to do so he did not know .  | Baley paused at the door of the airfoil and said firmly , " Giskard , I do not wish the windows opacified . I do not wish to sit in the hack . I want to sit in the front seat and observe the Outside . Since I will be sitting between you and Daneel , I should be safe enough , unless the car itself is destroyed . And , in that case , we will all he ( lestrovecl and it wont matter whether I am in front or in hack ... Giskard responded to the force of the statement by retreating into greater respectfulness . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Then you will stop the cal and I will clinch into the back seat and you can opacity the rear windows .

I am stating this as an order , Giskard . " Daneel said softly , " Partite ' Elijah is quite correct in his request , friend ( iskeu  --  d . Ile will be reasonably safe . " Giskard , pee baps reluctantly ( Baley could not interpret the expression on his not eluite-hiunan face ) , gave in and took his place at the controls .

There was no use trying to tell him . self that Daneel and Giskard showed no signs of fear and should he imitated . They were robots and could not feel fear . And then the car moved forward suddenly and Baley felt himself pushed hard against the seat . Within a minute he was moving at as fast a speed as he had ever experienced on the Expressways of the City . A wide , grassy road stretched out ahead . The speed seemed the greater for the fact that there were none of the friendly lights and structures of the City on either side but rather wide gulfs of greenery and irregular formations . Haley fought to keep his breath steady and to talk as naturally as he might of neutral things . He said , " We do n't seem to be passing airy farrrnlancl , Dancer . This seems to he unused land . " Daneel said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is privately owned parkland and estates . " " City ? " Bale ! could not accept the word . Ile knew what a City was . " Eos is the largest and most Important eity on Aurora . The first to he established . The Auroral ' World Iegislature sits here . The Chairman of the Legislature has his estate here and we will be passing it . " Not only a city but the largest . Baley looked about to either side . " I was under the impression that the Fastolle and ( dacha establishments were on the outskirts of Eos . I should think we would have passed the city limits by now . " " Not at all , Partner Elijah . We 're passing through its center . The limits are seven kilometers away and our destination is nearly forty kilometers beyond that . " " The center of the city ? I see no structures .

Trimensioual connections " Thc'v cull it viewing oil Sohuia , " said Maley . " And here , ton , in informal conversation , but TVC more formally . That takes care of much communication . Finally , Aurorans are fond of walking and it is not unusual to walk several kilometers for social visiting or even for business meetings where time is not of the essence . " " And we have to get somewhere that 's too far to walk , too close for air-cars , and trimensional viewing is not wanted  --  so we use a ground-car . " " An airfoil , more specifically , Partner Elijah , but that qualifies as a ground-car , I suppose . " " How long will it take to reach Vasilia 's establishment ? " " Not long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as perhaps you know . " There were some moments of silence and then Baley said , " It looks cloudy neat the horizon there ' ( ; iskard ne ntiated a curve at high speed , the airfoil tipping through an angle ni snow ' hilts .

' Then there was another brief turn and Giskard said , " Slr , we are in the parking lot of the Robotics Institute . We can now enter and visit the establishment that Dr. Vasilia maintains on the Institute grounds . " Bale ) , nodded . The trip had taken something between fifteen and twenty minutes ( as nearly as he could judge , Earth time ) and he was glad it was over . He said , rather breathlessly , " I want to know something about Dr. Fastolfe 's daughter before 1 meet her . You did not know her , did you , Daneel ? " Daneel said , " At the time I came into existence . I ) r. l astnlle and his daughter had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ met her . " " But as for you , ( ; iskar ( I , you and %he knew each other well Is that not so ? " " It is so , sir , " said ( ; iskard lmpas'ively . " And were fond of each ( ) than ? " " I believe , sir , " said ( ; isk ; ovl , that it gave Dr. Fastolfe 's daughter pleasure to the with me " " Did it give you pleasure to be with Ina ? " Giskard seemed to pick his words . " It gives me a sensation that I think is what human beings mean by ' I-Ieasrnme ' to he with any human being . " " But more so with Vasilia , I think . Am I right ? " " Her pleasure at being with me , sir , " said ( ; iskard , " did seers to stimulate those positronic potentials that pro ( lncc at  --  tiotls in me that are equivalent to those that pleasure produces in h 1 t 1111. beings . Or so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said suddenly , " Why did Vasilia leave her father ? " Giskard said nothing . Baley said , with the sudden peremptoriness of an Earthman addressing a robot , " I asked you a question , boy . " Giskard turned his head and stared at Baley , who , for a moment , thought the glow in the robot 's eyes might be brightening into a blaze of resentment at the demeaning word . However , Giskard spoke mildly and there was no readable ex- pression in his eyes when he said , " I would like to answer , sir , but in all matters concerning that separation , Miss Vasilia ordered me at that time to say nothing . " " But I 'm ordering you to answer ale and I can order you very firmly indeed  --  if I wish to . " Ciskard said , " l am sorry . Miss Vasilia , even at that time , was skilled in robotics and the orders she gave me were sufficiently powerful to remain , despite anything you are likely to say , sir . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ robotics , since Dr. Fastolfe told me she reprogrammed you on occasion . " " It was not dangerous to do so , sir . Dr. Fastolfe himself could always correct any errors . " " Did he have to ? " " He did not , sir . " " What was the nature of the reprogramming ? " " Minor matters , sir . " " Perhaps , but humor me . Just what was it she did ? " Ciskard hesitated and Baley knew what that meant at once . The robot said , " I fear that any questions concerning the reprogramming can not be answered by me. , . No , sir , lint the reprogrlunnling automatically wipes out what went before . If I am changed in any particular , it would seem to me that I have always been as changed and I would have no memory of what I was before I was changed . " " Then how do you know the reprogramming was minor ? " " Since Dr. Fastolfe never saw ally need of correcting what Miss Vasilia did  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suppose the changes were minor . You might ask Miss Vasilia , sir . " " I will , " said Baley . " I fear , however , that she will not answer , sir . " Baley 's heart sank . So far he had questioned only Dr. Fastolfe , Cladia , and the two robots , all of whom had overriding reasons to cooperate . Now , for the first time , he would be facing an unfriendly subject .  | 37 . Raley stepped out of the airfoil , which was resting on a grassy plot , and felt a certain pleasure in feeling solidity beneath his feet . Ile looked around in surprise , for the structures were rather thickly spread , and to his right was a particularly large one , built plainly , rather like a huge right-angled block of metal and glass . " Is that the Robotics Institute ? " he asked . Daneel said , " This entire complex is the Institute , Partner Elijah . You are seeing only a portion uul it is mote thickly built up than is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entity . It contains home establishments , laboratories , libraries , communal gymnasia , and so on . The large structure is the administrative center . " " This is so un-Aurorae , with all these buildings in view  --  at least judging from what I saw of Eos  --  that I should think there would be considerable disapproval . " " I believe there was , Partner Elijah , but the head of the Institute is friendly with the Chairman , who has much influence , and there was a special dispensation , I understand , because of research necessities . " Daneel looked about thoughtfully . " It is iIideed more compact than I had supposed . " " Than you had supposed ? Ilave von never been here before , Daneel ? " " No , Partner Elijah . " " How about you , Giskard ? " " No , sir , " said Giskard . Baley said , " You found your way here without trouble  --  and you seem to know the place " " We have been suitably informed , Partner Elijah , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come with you . " Balev nodded thoughtfully , then said , " Why did n't Dr. Fastolfe come with us ? " and decided , once again , that it made no sense to try to catch a robot off-guard . Ask a question rapidly  | or unexpectedly  --  and they simply waited until the question was absorbed and then answered . ' I'ltey were never caught off-guard . Daneel said , " As I ) r. hastolle said , he is not a member of the Institute and feels it would he improper to visit uninvited . " " But why is he not a member ? " " The reason for that I have never been told , Partner Elijah . " Haley 's eyes turned to t ; iskarcl , who said at once , " Nor I , sir . " Did not know ? Were told not to know ? ? Haley shrugged . It did not matter which . Human beings could lie and robots be instructed . Of course , human beings could be browbeaten or maneuvered out of a lie  --  if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ robots could be maneuvered out of instruction  --  if the questioner were skillful enough or unscrupulous enough ? but the skills were different and Baley had none at all with respect to robots . He said , " Where would we be likely to find Dr. Vasilia Fas-o toile ? " Dance said , " This is her establishment immediately before us. jl " Your have ' cell itIStrnctecl , then , : IS to its location ? " " That has been imprinted in our 1101111'v banks , Partner Elijah . " " Well , then , lead the way . " The orange sun was well up iuu the sky now and it was clearly nearing midday . As they apptoaeheel Vasilia 's establishment , they stepped into the shadow o ) the factory and Baley twitched a little as he felt the temperature drop immediately . His lips tightened at the night of occupying and settling worlds without Cities , when . the temperature was uncontrolled and subject to unpredictable , idiotic changes . ? And , he noted uneasily , the line of cloncls at the horizon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wished , with water cascading down . Earth ! I Ie longed for the Cities . Ciskard had walked into the establishment first and Daneel held out his arm to prevent Haley from following . Of course ! Ciskard was reconnoitering.  | So was Dance , for that matter . His eyes trove landscape with an intentness no human being could havf ? duplicated . Bale% was certain that those robotic eyes missed nothing . ( He wondered why robots were not equipped with four eyes erlunlly distributed about the perimeter of the head  --  or an optic strip totally circumnavigating it . Daneel could not be expected to , of course , since he had to be human in appearance , but why not ) iskard ? Or did that introduce complications of vision that the positronic pathways could not handle ? For a moment , Baley had faint vision of the complexities that burdened the life of a o ol x iticist . ) Giskard reappeared in the doorway and nodded . Dancers arm exerted a respectful pressure and 13alev moved h ) rwar ( l . The door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ establishment . but there had also been none ( lialev suddenly renienihered ) on those of Gladia and of Dr. l'astolfe . A sparse polnilation and separation helped insure privacy and , no doubt , the custom of noninterference helped , too . And , come to think of it , the ubiquitous robot guards were more efficient than any lock could be . The pressure of Daneel 's hand on Baley 's upper arm brought the latter to a halt . Giskard , ahead of them , was speaking in a low voice to two robots , who were themselves rather Giskardlike . A sudden coldness struck the pit of Haley 's stomach . What if some rapid maneuver substituted another robot for Giskard ? Would he be able to recognize the substitution ? ' fell two such robots apart ? Would he be left with a robot without special instructions to guard him , one who might innocently lead him into danger and then react with insufficient quickness when protection was necessary ? Controlling his voice , he said calmly to Daneel , " Remarkable the similarity in those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Certainly , Partner Elijah . Their clothing designs are different and their code numbers are different , as well . " " They do n't look different to me . " " You are not accustomed to notice that sort of detail . " Baley stared again . " What code numbers ? "  | " They are easily visible , Partner Elijah , when you know where to look and when your eves are sensitive farther into the infrared than human eyes are . " " Well , then , I would he in trnnlcic if I had to do the identifying , would n't I ' ? " Not at all , Partner Elijah . You had hut to ask a robot for its full name and serial number . It w  --  iilcl tell you . " " Even if instructed to give me a false one 's " Why should any robot be so instructed .. ' Raley decided not to explain . Giskard was , in any case , returning . He said to Baley , " Sir , you will be received . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the establishment led . Behind them came Baley and Daneel , the latter retaining his grip protectively . Following in the rear was Giskard . The two robots stopped before a double door which opened , apparently automatically , in both directions . The room within was suffused with a dim , grayish light  --  daylight diffusing through thick drapery . Raley ( ? Quill make out , not very clearly , a small human figure in the room , ( calf seated on a tall stool , with one elbow resting on a table that rue the length of the wall . Baley and Dance entered , ( : isk ; ucl coming up behind them . The door closed , leaving the ? ' omen iinuuer than ever . A female voice said sharply , " ( : lime no closer ! Stay where you are ! " And the room burst into full davlight . Baley blinked and looked upward . The ceiling was glassed and , through it , the sun could be seen . The sun seemed oddly dice , however , and could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affect the quality of the light within . Presumably , the glass ( or whatever the transparent substance was ) diffused the light without absorbing it .  | I I ' looked clown at the woman , who still maintained her pose at the stool , and said , " Dr. Vasilia Fastolfe ? " " I ) i . Vasilia Aliena , if you want a full name . I do not Ina-row the Haines of others . You may call me Dr. Vasilia . It is the name Icy which I am commonly known at the Institute . " Her voice , which had been rather harsh , softened , " And how are you , my old Friend Giskard ? " ( : iskard said , in tones oddly removed from his usual one , " I greet you ? " He paused and then said , " I greet you , Little Miss . " Vasilia smiled . " And this , I suppose , is the humaniform robot of whom I have heard  --  Daneel Olivaw ? " " Yes , Dr. Vasilia , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Fart lima ' ) . " " Elijah Baley , Doctor , " said Haley stiffly . " Yes , I 'm aware that EartIinicii have names and that Elijah Baley is yours , " she said ' Dolly . You do n't look one blasted thing like the actor who played yoo in the hyperwave show. ? " I am aware of that , Doctor . " " The onne who played Daneel was rather a good likeness , howev'er , but I suppose we are not here to discuss the show . " " We are not . " " I gather we are here , Earthman , to talk about whatever it is you want to say about Santirix Gremionis and get it over with . Right ? " " Not entirely , " said Baley . " That is not the primary reason for my coming , though I imagine we will get to it . " " Indeed ? Are you under the impression that we are lure to engage in a long and complicated discussion on whatever topic you choose to deal with ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be well-advised to allow me to manage this interview as I wish . " " Is that a threat ? " " No . " " Well , I have never met an Earthman and it might be interesting to see how closely you resemble the actor who played your role  --  that is , in ways other than appearance . Are you really the masterful person you seemed to be in the show ? " " The show , " said Baley with clear distaste , " was overdramatic it  | and exaggerated my personality in every direction . I would rather you accept me as I am and judge me entirely from how I appear to you right now . " Vasilia laughed . At least sou do n't seem overawed by me . That 's a point in your favor . Or do you think this Gremionis thing you 've got in mind puts you in a position to order me about ? " " I am not here to do anything but uncover the truth in the matter of the dead humaniform robot , jander Panell . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " 1 use one syllable in preference to phrases such as rendered inoperative . ' Does saying ' dead ' confuse you ? " Vasilia said , " You fence well . ? Debrett , bring the Earthman a chair . He will grow weary standing if this is to be a long conversation . Then get into your niche . And you may choose one , too , Daneel . ? Giskard , come stand by me . " Baley sat down . " Thank you , Debrett . ? Dr. Vasilia , I have no authority to question you ; I have no legal means of forcing you to answer my questions . However , the death of jander Panell has put your lather in a position of soma ? " " It has put whom it- a position .. " Your father .. " Earthman , I sometimes refer to a certain individual as my father , but no one else does . Please use it proper name . " " Dr. Han Fastolle . Ile is soul lather , is n't he ? As a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are using it biological term . I share genes with him in a manner characteristic of what on Earth would be considered a father-daughter relationship . This is a matter of indifference on Aurora , except iu medical and genetic matters . I can conceive of my suffering from certain metabolic states in which it would be appropriate to consider the physiology and biochemistry of those with whom I share genes  --  parents , siblings , children , and so ou . Otherwise these relationships are not generally referred to in polite Auroran society . ? I explain this to you because you are an Earthman . " " If I have offended against custom , " said Baley , " it is through  | Ignorance and I apologize . May I refer to the gentleman under dlsruSSiun by name ? " " ( ; ertainly , , , " In that case , the death of Jander Panell has put Dr. Han Fastolb ? into a position of some difficulty and I would assume that vole would be concerned enough to desire to help him . " " You assume @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ le is your ? He brought you up . He cared for you . You had a profound affection for each other . He still feels a profound affection for you . " " Did he tell you that ? " " It was obvious from the details of our conversations  --  even from the fact that he has taken an interest in the Solarian woman , Gladia Delmarre , because of her resemblance to yon . " " Did he tell you that ? " " He did , but even if he had n't , the resemblance k obvious . " " Nevertheless , Earthman , I owe I ) r . I'cestolfe nothing . Your assumptions can be dismissal . " Baley cleared his throat . " Aside f ruin any personal feelings you might or might not have , there is the matter of the future of the Galaxy . Dr. Fastolfe wishes new worlds to be explored and settled by human beings . I f the political repercussions of Jander 's death lead to the exploration and settlement of the new worlds by robots , Dr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humanity . Surely you would not he a party to such a catastrophe . " Vasilia said indifferently , watching him closely , " Surely not , if I agreed with Dr. Fastolfe . I do not . I see no halm in having humaniform robots doing the work . I am here at the Institute , in fact , to make that possible . I am a Globalist . Since 1 ) r . Iastolfe is a Humanist , he is my political enemy . " Her answers were clipped and direct , no longer than they had to be . Each time there followed a definite silence , as though she were waiting , with interest , for the next question . Baley had the impression that she was curious about him , amused by him , making wagers with herself as to what the next question might be , determined to give him just the minimum information necessary to force another question .  | He said , " Have you long been a member of this Institute ? " " Since its formation . " " Are there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ third of Aurora 's roboticists are members , though only al-ut hall of these actually live and work on the Institute grounds . " " Do other memlmrs of the Institute share your views on the robotic exploration of other worlds ? Do they oppose Dr. Fastolfe 's views one and all ? " " I suspect that - post of them are Globalists , but I do n't know that we have taken a vote on the matter or even discussed it forwally . You had better ask them all individually . " " Is Dr. Fastolfe a member of the Institute ? " " No . " Baley waited a bit , but she said nothing beyond the negative . He said , " Is n't that surprising ? I should think he , of all people , would be a member . " " As it happens , we do n't want him . What is perhaps less important , he does n't want us . " Is n't that even more surprising ? " " I do n't think so . " ? And then , as though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she said , " He lives in the rit ' of Ens . I suppose Moll know the significance of the name , Earthman ' ? " Baley nodded and said , is the ancient Greek goddess of the dawn , as Aurora is the ancient Itoon:ui goddess of the dawn . " " Exactly . Dr. Han Fastolfe lives iii the City of the Dawn on the World of the Dawn , but he is not himself a believer in the Dawn . He does not understand the necessary method of expansion through the Galaxy , of converting the Spacer Dawn into broad Galactic Day . The robotic exploration of the Galaxy is the only practical way to carry the task through and he wo n't accept it  --  or us . " Baley said slowly , " Why is it the only practical method ? Aurora and the other Spacer worlds were not explored and settled by robots but by human beings . " " Correction . By Earthpeople . It was a wasteful and inefficient  | procedure and there are now no Earthpeople that we will allow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , long-lived and healthy , and we have robots who are infinitely more versatile and flexible than those available to the human beings who originally settled our worlds . Times and matters are wholly different  --  and today only robotic exploration is feasible . " " Let us suppose you are right and Dr. Fastolfe is wrong . Eve ? so , he has a logical view . Why wo n't he and the Institute accept each other ? Simply because they disagree on this point ? " " No , this disagreement is comparatively minor . There is a more fundamental conflict . " Again Baley paused and again she added nothing to her remark . He did not feel it safe to display irritation , so he said quietly , almost tentatively , " What is the more f-nula-gciital conflict ? " The amusement in Vasilia 's voice cane nearer the so if ace . It softened the lines of ' her face somewhat and , for a inonwnt , she looked more like ( ladia . You could n't guess , unless it were explained to you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I ) r . Vasilia . " " Well , then , Earthman , I have been told that Earthpeople are short-lived . I have not been misled in that , have I ? " Baley shrugged , " Some of us live to be a hundred years old , Earth time . " He thought a bit . " Perhaps a hundred and thirty or so metric years . " " And how old are you ? " " Forty-five standard , sixty metric . " " I am sixty-six metric . I expect to live three uu tric c enturics more at least  --  if I am careful . " Baley spread his hands wide . " I congratulate you . " " There are disadvantages . " " I was told this morning that , in three or four centuries , many , many losses have a chance to accumulate . " " I 'm afraid so , " said Vasilia . " And many , many gains have a chance to accumulate , as well . On the whole , it balances . " " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not a scientist , of course . "  | " I am a plainclothesman  --  a policeman , if you like . " " But perhaps you know scientists on your world . " " I have met some , " said Haley cautiously . " You know how tiler work ? We are told that on Earth they cooperate out ( I ' necessity . ' flier have , at most , half a century of active labor in the course of their short lives . Less than seven metric decades . Not much can he doote that time . " " Some t.l our scientists had accomplished quite a deal in considerably less tiute . " " Because they have taken advantage of the findings others have made before them and profit from the use they can make of contemporary findings by others . Is n't that so ? " " Of course . We have a scientific community to which all contribute , across the expanse of space and of time . " " Exactly . It wo n't work otherwise . Each scientist , aware of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forced into the community , can not help becoming part of the clearinghouse . Progress thus becomes enormously greater than it would be if this did not exist . " Is not this the case on Aurora and the other Spacer worlds , loo ? " asked Iialev . " In theory It is ; in practice not so hutch . The pressures in a long-lived society are less . Scientists here have three or three and it half centimes to devote to a problem , so that the thought arises that significant propess ' nay be made in that time by a solitary worker . It becomes possible to feel a kind of intellectual greed  --  to want to ace ( tnithsh something on your own , to assume a property right to a l ' tic ilar facet of progress , to be willing to see the general advance slowed  --  rather than give up what you conceive to he yours alone . And the general advance is slowed on Spacer worlds as a result , to the point where it is difficult to outpace the work dune on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assume you would n't say this if I were not to take it that I ) r . I Ian Fastolfe behaves iu this manner . " " Ile certainly does . It is his theoretical analysis of the positrunic brain that has made the humaniform robot possible . He  | has used it to construct  --  with the help of the late I ) r . Sartonyom robot blend Dance ! , but he has not published the important details of his theory , nor does he make it available to anylaic else . In this way , he  --  and he alone  --  holds a stranglehold on the production of humaniform robots . " lialev furrowed his brow . " And the Robotics Institute is dedicated to cooperation among scientists ? " " Exactly . This Institute is made up of over a hundred topnotch roboticists of different ages , advancements , and skills and we hope to establish branches on other worlds and make it an interstellar association . All of us are dedicated to communicating our separate discoveries or speculations to the onnm ni fund ? doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because you live such short lives . " This , however , Dr. Han Fastolfe will Ildt'do. f 'm sure you think of Dr. Han Fastolfe as a nobly ldi i Amman patriot , but he will not put his intellectual pr p. as he thinks of it  - -  into the common fund and therefore he dills not want us . And because he assumes a personal property right upon scientific discoveries , we do not want him . ? You no hinge ' find the mutual distaste a mystery , I take it . " Bale ) , nodded his head , then said , " You think this will work ? this voluntary giving up of personal glory ? " " It must , " said Vasilia grimly . " And has the Institute , through community endeavor , duplicated I ) r . Fastolfe 's individual work and rediscovered the theory of the huivaiiiform positronic brain ? " " We will , in time . It is inevitable . " " And you are making no attempt to shorten the time it will take by persuading Dr. Fastolfe to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nn the way to persuading him . " " Through the working of the Jander scandal ? " " I do n't think you really have to ask that question . ? Well , have I told you what von wanted to know , Earthman ? " Baley said , " You have told me some things I did n't know . " " Then it is time for you to tell me about Gremionis . Why have you brought up the name of this barber in connection with me ? "  | " Barber ? " " He considers himself a hair stylist , among other things , but he is a barber , plain and simple . Tell me about him  --  or let us consider this interview at an encl . " Baley felt weal v. It weaned char to him that Vasilia had enjoyed the fencing . She had given hint enough to whet his appetite and now he %voulcl he loac  --  ed to I , uv additional material with information of Ills own . But In had none . Or at least he had only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vitally wrong , he was through . I he therefore fenced on his own . " You understand , Dr. Vasilia , that you ca n't get away with pretending that it is farcical to suppose there is a connection between Gremionis and yourself . " " Why not , when it is farcical ? " " Oh no . If it were farcical , you would have laughed in my face and shut off trimensional contact . The mere fact that you were willing to abandon your earlier stand and receive me  --  the mere fact that you have been talking to me at length and telling nee a great many things  --  is a clear admission that you feel that I just possibly might have my knife at your jugular . " Vasilia 's jaw muscles tightened and she said , in a low and angry voice , " See here , little Earthman , miv position is ' vulnerable and you prolmhly know it . I elm the daughter of Dr. Fastolfe and there arc sonic here at the Institute who are foolish enough ? or knavish enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what kind of story you may have heard  --  or made up  --  but that it 's more or less farcical is certain . Nevertheless , no matter how farcical , it might be used efleetively against me . So I am willing to trade for it . I have told you some things and I might tell you more , but only if you now tell ine what you have in your hand and convince me you are telling Inc the truth . So tell me now . " If you try to play games with Inc , I will be in no worse position than at present if I kick you out  --  and I will at least get pleasure out of that . And I will use what leverage I have with the Chairman to get him to cancel his decision to let you come here and have you sent right back to Earth . There is consid- Kabk pressure on hint now to do this and you wo n't want the addition of ' mine . " So talk ! Now ! " Haley 's impulse was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way to see if he were right . That , he felt , would not work . She would see what he was doing  --  she was no fool- - and would stop him . He was on the track of something , he knew , and he did n't want to spoil it . What she said about her vulneeul , le position as the result of her relationship to her father might well be true , but she still would not have been frightamd Into seeing hint if she had n't suspected that some notion he bed Was not completely farcical . He had to come out with something , th with something important that would establish , at once , Sntne sort of domination over her . Therefore  --  the gamble . He said , " Santirix Gremionis offered himself to you . " And , before Vasilia could react , he raised the ante by saying , with an added touch of harshness , " And not once but many times . " Vasilia clasped her hands over one knee , then pulled herself up and seated herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comfortable . She looked at Giskard , who stood motionless and expressionless at her side . Then she looked at Baley and said , " Well , the idiot offers himself to everyone he sees , regardless of age and sex . I would be unusual if he paid me no attention . " Baley made the gesture of brushing that to one side . ( She had not laughed . She had not brought the interview to an encl . She had not eve ' ) put nn a display of fury . She was waiting to see what he would build out of the statement , so he did have something by the tail . ) He said , " That is exaggeration , Dr. Vasilia . No one , however undiscriminating , would fail to make choices and , in the case of this Gremionis , you were selected and , despite your refusal to  | accept him , he continued to offer himself , quite out of keeping with Aurorae custom . " Vasilia said , " I am glad vnu realize I refused him . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ courtesy , any offer  --  or almost any offer  --  should he accepted , but that is not my opinion . I see no reason why I have to subject myself to some uninteresting event that will marrly waste my tune . I ) o you find something objectionable in that , Earthman ? " " I have no opinion to offer ' - either favorable or unfavorable ? in co'utectiot ' with Auroral ' custom . " ( She was still waiting , listening to him . What was she waiting for ? Would it be for what he wanted to say but yet was n't sure he dared to ? ) She said , with an effort at lightness , " 1 ) o you have anvthing at all to offer  --  or are we through ? " " Not through , " said Raley , who was now forced to take another gamble . " You recognized this non-Aurorae perseverance in Gremionis and it occurred to you that you could make use of it . " " Really ? I-low mad ! What possible use could I make of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you very strongly , it would not be difficult to arrange to have him attracted by another who rese'nbled Von gory closely . You urged him to do so , perhaps pron'i.sing to accept I'iut if the ether slid not . " " Who is this poor woman who resembles ate closely ? ? " You do not know ? ( route How , that is naive , 1 ) r . Vasilia . I am talking of the Solaria ! ' woman , ( Nadia , whom I already have said has come under the protection of I ) r . Fastolfe precisely because she does resemble VIM . 1'on expressed no surprise when I referred to this at the beginning of our talk . It is too late to pretend ignorance now . " Vasilia looked at hint sharply . " And from his interest in her , you deduced that he must first have been interested in me ? It was this wild guess with which you approached me ? " " Not entirely a wild guess . There are other substantiating factors . Do you deny all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beside her and Raley wondered what details were carried by the long sheets of paper on it . Ile could make out , from a distance , complexities of  | that he knew would be totally meaningless to him , no how carefully and thoroughly he studied them . IIn said , " I grow weary . You have told me that Gremionis Interested first in me , and then iii ntv look-alike , the elan . And now you want me to deny it . Why should I take trouble to deny it ? Of what importance is it ? Even if it were e , how could this damage me in any way ? You are saying that 3 was almoycd by attentions I did n't want and that I ingeniously deflected them . Well ? " Raley said , " It is not so much what you died , as why . You knew that Gremionis was the type of person who would be persistent .
