// // // // WASHINGTON , June 27 - President Reagan said today that the United States was working to strengthen economic , cultural , scientific , consular and other contacts with the Soviet Union while reserving the right to denounce any Soviet actions that " threaten the peace. " // In a speech to specialists on Soviet-United States exchanges , Mr. Reagan reviewed a long list of subjects that he said were under discussion with Moscow , despite the suspension of nuclear weapons talks in Geneva. // " I don ' t think there is anything we ' re encouraging the Soviet leaders to do that is not as much in their interest as it is in ours , " he said . " If they ' re as committed to peace as they say , they should join us and work with us. // " If they sincerely want to reduce arms , there ' s no excuse for refusing to talk , " he added .

" // Administration officials stressed that the speech , while aimed at promoting progress with Moscow , had political implications as well : It sought to ease fear among some voters , they said , that a dangerous state of relations had developed between Moscow and Washington. // Most of the issues Mr. Reagan said were under discussion with the Soviet Union had been disclosed earlier. // One new initiative was Mr. Reagan ' s statement that he would soon propose a draft of a new agreement on cultural exchanges . He also said he had proposed that a group of Americans travel to Kiev to prepare the way for opening a consulate there. // In addition , Administration officials disclosed that the United States had suggested a cooperative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rendezvous and practice a rescue mission . The United States and the Soviet Union have already conducted a rendezvous in space , in 1975 , when Apollo and Soyuz crews met in orbit. // An aide acknowledged that the list offered by Mr. Reagan was not " earth shaking . " But officials said the remarks were another sign of a shift in tone by the Administration , one that began Jan. 16 when Mr. Reagan said he was prepared to offer " something in return " for Soviet concessions in arms talks. // Despite that gesture , the Soviet Union has refused to return to the nuclear arms negotiating table . Administration officials have expressed disappointment , saying that Moscow seemed uncertain and inclined to wait until after the November elections before deciding how to respond . <> <> U.S. Reports ' Quiet Diplomacy ' // In January Mr. Reagan appealed to the Soviet Union to help forge " a constructive working relationship " in a wide range of areas .

White House aides say such an impression could damage Mr. Reagan ' s re-election chances . <> <> Closed Society ' a Problem // In calling for expanded ties with Moscow , Mr. Reagan said " meaningful contact with a closed society will never be easy. " // He added that he was " as disturbed as you are by recent reports of new measures taken by Soviet authorities to restrict contacts between Soviet citizens and foreigners . " Such steps , he went on , came " on top of intensified repression " of dissidents. // " We all pay a heavy price " when the Soviet Union is sealed off from the outside world , Mr. Reagan said , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cultural riches of the Soviet people.

No text was given out in advance . Reporters were barred from attending . <> <> Officials Saw ' Nothing New ' // All week , Administration officials cautioned that there would be " nothing new " in the speech , although some suggested it would be newsworthy .

Rather the issue is the attempt to spread their dominance by using military power as a means of intimidation. " // Mr. Reagan , in fact , has been among those who have said this. // " There is much evidence to support this view , " Mr. Reagan added. // The White House put out a five-page fact sheet listing various areas of agreement and discussion , almost all of them from the 1970 ' s when numerous ties were established during the height of detente . <> <> Agreements Suspended in 1980 // The agreements were mostly suspended in 1980 after the Soviet military intervention in Afghanistan in December 1979. // The Reagan Administration further curtailed contacts after the imposition of martial law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last September after a South Korean airliner was shot down in Soviet airspace .
