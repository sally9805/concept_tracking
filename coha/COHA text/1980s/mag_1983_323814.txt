High-ranking South Koreans are killed during a state visit <P> South Korean President Chun Doo Hwan was running a few minutes late for the wreath-laying ceremony at the Martyrs ' Mausoleum in Rangoon last Sunday . As they waited for his arrival , high-ranking South Korean officials chatted quietly with their Burmese hosts . Suddenly , an earsplitting explosion cracked through the one-story building , blowing the center of the roof skyward . Within seconds , a scene suffused with the orderliness of diplomatic protocol was transformed into bloody chaos : smoking ruins , survivors screaming hysterically , others racing frantically from the building to seek help . The toll of the blast , apparently caused by a bomb hidden in the mausoleum 's ceiling : 19 killed and 48 injured . The dead included 16 leading South Korean officials , among them Deputy Prime Minister Suh Suk Joon , Foreign Minister Lee Bum Suk and two other Cabinet ministers , as well as three Burmese journalists . <P> Chun , whose visit to Rangoon was the first stop in an 18-day swing through six Asian and Pacific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bomb , apparently meant for him , went off . His motorcade immediately turned away ; soon afterward , the President cut short the journey and flew back to Seoul with his wife . Cabinet members who had not accompanied the President on the tour quickly convened in the South Korean capital , ordered the country 's armed forces and police on special alert , and set up a task force of vice ministers to deal with the crisis . Barely before the smoke from the blast had cleared , South Korean officials charged that the bomb had been planted by North Korean agents , but provided no specific evidence to back their claim . Said Information Minister Lee Jin Hie : " We have come to realize once again the true nature of North Korea as a barbarous international group . " Burmese President U San Yu called the attack a " premeditated and dastardly act of terrorists . " Two Burmese ministers were injured . <P> The blast plunged South Koreans into another round of mourning barely a month after the Soviet downing of Korean Air Lines Flight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , soldiers scurried back to their bases from weekend leave and civilians listened intently to their radios . <P> The Rangoon attack decimated the senior leadership of Chun 's Cabinet . Suh Suk Joon , 45 , a U.S.-educated technocrat , was appointed Deputy Prime Minister last July ; he also headed South Korea 's economic planning board . Perhaps the biggest loss to Chun was the death of Foreign Minister Lee , 58 , who had conceived and planned the foreign tour . A seasoned diplomat who once served as Ambassador to India ( 1976-80 ) , Lee was given his portfolio in 1982 . A cornerstone of his policy was to try to establish ties for South Korea with " nonbelligerent " socialist and Third World nations ; thus , Chun 's aborted trip included stops in Sri Lanka and India . Lee had also suggested that a solution to continuing North Korean-South Korean tensions might lie in permanently recognizing the split , but the North remains adamantly opposed and still demands national reunification .               @ @ @ @ @ @
