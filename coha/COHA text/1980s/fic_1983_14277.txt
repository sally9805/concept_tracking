A fifty-year-old black woman in a flowered summer cotton dress made vague with age . Over the dress she wears a beauty contest sway reading Miss Prettybelle Kentucky . In her hair is a gold bead tiara . In one hand she carries a golden scepter and in the other several slightly wilted long-stem yellow roses . She is a plain woman with a mountainous energy that contains elements of the traditional Southern tent revival . MAMA So what you think 's wrong with this picture ? ( Adjusts her tiara . ) Yeah , that 's right , Miss Prettybelle Kentucky . Struck three to four million citizens of this here Commonwealth dumb with admiration . Uh-huh ! The considerable number who was dumb already jes ' got theyselves struck dumber . Yes , yesssssss ! Oh , I got the beauty ! My big ol ' daughter Shasta Rue , she got it for me . " Do n't cry , Mama .

" " Cause first , God made him the pretty . Then he make him the plain to make the pretty shine , an ' then he made us , Shasta Rue , to give them plain folks a laugh on Saturday night . " Then Shasta she bang on the table . She 's a big strong girl , Shasta , an ' she yell , " An ' you made me , did n't you , Mama ?

We haul ass outta that trailer over to Loco Boys ' pick-up an ' we hotwire that sumbitch , an drive eighty million , lead-footin ' bumpity-squealin ' , lay-rubber miles-an-hour downtown . An ' we kill that Kentucky Lucky half-pint dead on the way , singin ' " Amazin ' Grace " and " Deep Soul Kisses " and yellin ' about them beauties , tears running down our faces , and then we see it . See where they got the pageant . Loomin ' up . All shiny like a jewel box . Name up in lights . Search lights criss-crossin ' . Shasta rockin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " she yells . An ' I do , I slam ' em . I bang ' em and we go smashin ' our heads through that pick-up windshield like a kiss through Kleenex , an ' we 're bleedin ' an ' cryin ' , and we 're outta the pick-up , an ' this shrimped-up tuxedo doorman says , " Y'all cai n't go in there . " An ' I stomp on 's foot and Shasta rips off his li'l blond toup an ' we wipe off the blood wif it an ' we 're through that lobby eatin ' usherettes on the way an ' Shasta she hauls open these big ol ' oak doors an ' there it is ! Yes Lord , there it is ! We in the theatre with the Miss Kentucky Prettybelles pageant.An ' there 's them beauties straight in a line , rainbow dresses and ' lectric bouquets , smile-to-smile like one big long picket fence , an ' they waitin ' on the envelope for they fate to be delivered by one a ' them A.C./D.C. /Emcees . An @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is blonde . Look like a police lineup for Palomino ponies . White folks must jes ' kill them brunettes at birth . An ' Shasta she goes crazy ! Sound come through her throat like an ash from a volcano , an ' the rivers dry up , an ' all the dogs and cats turn to stone , an ' all over town the trees start glowin ' in the dark an ' Shasta an ' her mama start down that aisle , pickin ' up speed , an ' it 's downhill , gettin ' steep , rollin ' , roarin ' , and there 's ushers step up and we blow ' em away , poppin ' up , goin ' down , poppin ' up , goin ' down , an ' we speedin ' , and we fly over this pit , this fifteen-foot hole an ' the audience is screamin ' and then there we are , we up there , we up there with the beauties.An ' Shasta stops , an ' the audience it stops , an ' the man with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the balcony it stops , an ' it 's grave-closin ' low moanin ' , down deep , well-water quiet . An ' Shasta spreads her arms , she lets out her wing span , an ' her eyes bug out and she say in this deep bass voice , " I come for my beauty . " An ' they all still smilin ' but they got pee-pee seepin ' outta the corners of their eyes . An ' then Shasta she throw her head back an ' crows like a rooster , an ' we 're amongst ' em like bears in a hamster hutch.Oh , there 's bouquets flyin ' , an ' strips of chiffon like a blizzard , an ' falsies floppin ' out like burger patties . Store-bought eyelashes gittin ' stuck on boobies an ' ol ' Shasta , she stuff two fuck-me pumps in the emcee 's mouth and kick his Miami-tan ass right into the orchestra pit . I got this one blonde beauty by her prissy French-braids and I 'm hootin ' , " Gim me that uptown wig you Baptist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this high place , clear like a tornado alert comes this voice sayin ' " Y'all hold on there Batman , you and Robin back your blackness off ! " I look up and Shasta looks up , and there she is , lightnin ' zappin ' off her tiara , radiation round her head , Miss Kentucky , last year 's model , got her gown on , got her crown on , got her sash on , oh so white looks like she been bleached once a day since creation , an ' she got crimson red hair like the Grand Klan Dragon just set her to fire , and them neon blue eyes flashin ' on and off , blinkin ' and winkin ' , and baby sparkles like fireflies midst the hairs on her arms , and she say , " What you niggers want ? " An ' Shasta she shake her ham-fist up in the air , and she stamp on the floor an ' she say , " I come for my mama 's beauty ! " An ' Miss Vanilla she walk her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' til she nose-to-nose with Shasta Rue , an ' she say , " Shit , honey , you want this raggedy crap , you can sure as hell have it . You can have the crown , the gown , and the chicken la king . You can pull that parachute off them new Toyotas , dress like Scarlett O'Whatsit at the Kosair luncheon , an ' chap your lips at the kiss-a-queen booth at the Twitchelltown Fair . You ai n't chaos and confusion darlin ' , you the goddamned marines ! " Then she turn to the multitude an ' she say , " Y'all redneck trash , hesh up , you hear ? " An ' she lay that sash on me , gim me her rhinestone scepter and gold bead tiara , an ' then she smile on Shasta Rue and give her her ear bobs.Lordy , it was lessez faire ! An ' the three of us walk on out , hand-in-hand like ol ' Hubert Humphrey 's wet dream a ' racial equality , an ' the Red Sea parts an ' we under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Thank you , Miss Pale , " an ' she say , " You entirely welcome , Aunt Jemima , " an ' she unzip her strapless aquamarine dot-sequin formal an ' she say , " They ask you where I gone , Sweet Ebony , you tell ' em I gone to Houston to the Spoon Gravy debutante ball . " An ' she walks off down Third Street naked as a jaybird in her lime green heals , an ' that white pickaninny 's whistlin ' " Dixie . " Lemme tell you one thing , it takes a real lady to walk bare naked through downtown Louisville after ' leven o'clock at night an ' git home with two arms and legs . Yes , yesssssss ! Well , that 's how Shasta Rue got me the beauty . White missy lay it down like it was spit or ol ' gum , but I know better . Beauty beats smart . Beauty is the life .
