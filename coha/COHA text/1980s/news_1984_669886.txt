Cost-conscious corporations are reining in the growth of their pension plans , cutting funding and even eliminating contributions entirely for several years . For some of the nearly 37 million Americans covered by private pension plans , the cutback could raise the risk their companies ' plans won ' t be strong enough to support expected retirement benefits . It could also reduce demand for stocks , 25% of which are owned by pension plans , and may mean more money will move into the bond market . And for professional money managers , it seems certain to bring more intense competition . " Competition will be extremely vicious  --  a struggle to wrest away assets from competing managers instead of feeding off ever-increasing cash flows , " says William Fouse , chief of index funds at Mellon Capital Management Corp . Private and public pension assets have more than tripled since 1975 , reaching $1. 15 trillion at the end of 1983 . Just four years ago , a widely publicized Labor Department study projected that private pension assets alone would reach $2. 9 trillion by 1995 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ billion , that projection seems increasingly doubtful . Last year almost three out of five major industrial companies cut their pension expenses , according to an unreleased study by Johnson &; Higgins , a New York-based actuary and insurance broker . The average reduction was 3. 5% . Companies making cutbacks include American Telephone &; Telegraph Co . , Chase Manhattan Corp . , Eastman Kodak Co . , International Business Machines Corp. and International Harvester Co . So far , the ability of pension funds to pay expected benefits doesn ' t appear jeopardized . But corporate pension managers are becoming less risk-averse . Howard Winklevoss , an actuary at Johnson &; Higgins , says most of his corporate clients estimate chances are 90% or greater , depending on future market moves , that their pension contribution levels will cover future payouts . " But if you ask them what level of confidence they want to have , most say only 60% to 70% , " he says . While many companies are reducing pension plan contributions as part of overall cost-cutting efforts , others are paring assets to ward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York brokerage firm , estimates that pension plans at 400 of the biggest companies had $42 billion more than they needed last year . Such overfunding can make a company a very attractive acquisition target , because the acquiring company can terminate the pension plan , retrieve the excess assets and start a new plan . Companies are also using this approach to get money out of their own plans . Some actuaries and other consultants say the slower growth of pension plans is a short-term result of the healthy stock and bond markets . Others , however , insist it will be long lasting because several factors that fueled the earlier boom have changed :  --  Inflation is down , lowering projected wage increases and estimated benefit payouts in years ahead.  --  Assumptions about future returns on pension fund investments are more optimistic . Typical return-rate assumptions have increased 1. 5 percentage points since 1981 to a 7. 5% to 9% range , says Robin Holloway , a pension actuary at Towers , Perrin , Forster &; Crosby . Each percentage-point increase can lead to a reduction in current @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Retirement Income Security Act of 1974  --  which requires employers to stash away enough cash to honor their pension promises and to manage that hoard prudently  --  hasn ' t turned out to be as inhibiting as expected . Federal enforcement " is largely regarded as a paper tiger , " says Roger Thomas , general counsel to the House Select Committee on Aging . Whatever their individual reasons , companies are becoming more aggressive in cutting contributions . Of some 50 major companies where Johnson &; Higgins is studying pension plan funding , about 45 are planning to cut pension costs , and perhaps 20 are contemplating making no contribution for one or more years , Mr. Winklevoss says . Besides reducing the cash going into existing plans , companies are also switching to profit sharing or savings plans , which don ' t promise a set pension payout . Instead , companies merely make set contributions and leave investment decisions to employees . These defined-contribution plans also shift the entire investment risk to the employees . And because individuals tend to invest more conservatively than institutions , such plans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  are likely to put more money into bonds and less into stocks . The stock market may also lose some investors because actuaries must be more cautious with funds that have lots of stocks . Although stocks have historically outperformed bonds , their returns aren ' t fixed the way bond returns are . So the more corporations put into bonds , the higher the rates of return their actuaries can assume . Chrysler Corp. and Bethlehem Steel Corp. , for example , between them switched about $1. 1 billion from stocks to bonds , locking in fixed returns to raise their pension plans ' assumed returns . That enabled both to cut current contributions , in Bethlehem ' s case by $50 million a year . For stock money managers , such shifts and cutbacks can mean lost business . Dave Williams of Alliance Capital Management Corp. , a New York money manager , says his firm lost Chrysler as a customer when it shifted to bonds and lost Celanese Corp. when it terminated part of its plan . At the same time , the trend should help well-known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ managers , says Donald Kurtz of Equitable Life Assurance Society of the U.S. Individuals , who don ' t have the same performance measurement tools as pension funds , are likely to favor big firms with names they know , he says . Others say the trend should also favor mutual funds sold to the public at the expense of lesser known money managers who work for pension funds . The reason : mutual funds have been selling to individuals all along and have known track records and results that appear in the newspapers daily . " The dominant player in the stock market is going to be mutual funds , " predicts Greg Smith , research director of PrudentialBache Securities Inc .
