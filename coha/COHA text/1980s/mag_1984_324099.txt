Hear the language of the prairie wind . The muffled groan of a forgotten and rusted windmill . The taut , thin cry of a young hawk at a thousand feet poised on invisible thermal crests . The worried whispers of hundreds of millions of stalks of corn , ear to fat ear , leaf on leaf . It all says more in ten minutes about beginnings and endings , about hopes and disappointments than Ronald Reagan and Walter Mondale have said in a year-a loud , loud year . <P> Angry shouts from Washington and Moscow , arguments between Republicans and Democrats , thunderous political conventions , ear-splitting Olympic extravaganzas , mines and missile attacks , noise and people and people making noise . The beaches are filled and the forests infiltrated , and even the high mountain passes have traffic jams of mobile homes . So come to the prairie and listen . Nobody goes there in August-except grasshoppers and God . <P> Strange how the pressures of the world seem to have cropped out in the center of the country . The fecund fields of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can sensibly conceive ( 5,308,000 bu. made up of at least 400 billion individual kernels , any one of which makes a good chew for a boy doing nothing but hiking in the sun and tasting the earth 's power ) . That is corn coveted by the adversary , the Soviet Union . Corn that would feed the hungry of Bangladesh if they could only get it . Corn that is so abundant that much of it is packed away and stored and sometimes rots . Corn that is crushing the very genius that produced it . <P> But beneath those miracle plants the precious mantle of topsoil is washing away , some 13 tons per acre every year . The experts say a tolerable limit is a five-ton loss . So if nothing more is done , in less than 50 years the great resource on which rests our national strength and confidence will begin to ebb . And we could lose more than that , says Lester Brown of the Worldwatch Institute in Washington . A thousand years ago , the Mayan civilization in the Guatemalan lowlands disappeared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Modern analysis found that this agriculture-intensive society collapsed when the topsoil ran out . <P> Pay heed , Reagan . High interest rates , which these folks link to the huge federal deficits , have brought bankruptcy to more farmers than at any other time since the Great Depression . Families , after generations on the same land , have given up and drifted off to the melancholy ranks of the rootless . Pay heed , Mondale . The last thing they need is another tax increase on top of real estate taxes , sales taxes , income taxes , Social Security taxes . And stores that long ago lost their merchants have filled up with Government offices where the personnel never seems to dimmish , and their pay always seems to go up , never down like those who try to create the wealth and risk all they have and never go out on strike .
