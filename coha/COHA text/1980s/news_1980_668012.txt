" Ugh , " she says . " Geez , " I say . What does that mean , that " geez " ? I am not sure . I am the one with the worrisome reaction . I do not turn my head . I watch these games , one after another , and the big hits continue to excite , to fascinate , to . . . I ' m not sure what . I just know that I sit and watch , and when a big hit arrives , I say my " geez " and then I usually say something like " Did you see THAT ? " I am not happy that I say what I do . Didn ' t I see Darryl Stingley ? I saw Darryl Stingley . I saw - everybody saw , more times than he wanted - the entire , sorry business . I have seen Stingley since that sorry day when he was hit and paralyzed in Oakland , seen him in his wheelchair and his new , sad life . I was shaken - everybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why am I back , watching these games the way I always watched ? I don ' t know . I remember that for a couple of months after Stingley was hurt two seasons ago , I did not like to watch football very much . I was sickened by the big hits , the collisions . And then . . . I don ' t know , I forgot , I guess . I just wandered back to where I always had been . " They ' re professionals , " I guess I tell myself . " They assume the risks . They know what could happen . That is why they make so much money . . . " It is a convenient rationalization and I make it often . Boxing . Auto racing . Hockey fights . Football . I am able to watch all the violent sports , watch them at their lowest , most violent levels , and , I suppose , to enjoy . I know that I was out of my seat , literally , across the broadloom and drawn to the television @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Square Garden stands . I know my eyes have become widest at prize fights as the potential winner has had the potential loser one stiff punch away from oblivion . I know I have watched those football hits . " Did you see THAT ? " Yes , of course , I saw that . I might be stunned , embarrassed , here and there when the participants in the scenarios of violence do not move and are stuffed into ambulances - Patriot linebacker Steve Nelson , for instance , in Green Bay and tight end Russ Francis in Miami - but the players soon return , and what is lost ? Nelson laughs about his trip into unconsciousness . Francis , despite the fact that doctors are worried about his brain waves , volunteers to play in the final games of the season . Everything ' s back to normal , isn ' t it ? Stingley even watches the games again . Who am I to be any different ? I just don ' t think when I watch these games . That ' s it . Does anybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group swallow with Mork and Mindy and Rockford ' s assorted files . I accept the violence as part of the show , maybe the best part of the show . I accept it the way I accept an entertaining set of jugglers on parade . I delude myself . I let myself forget . I am wrong . I know I am wrong when I read a thing like Jack Tatum ' s new book , " They Call Me Assassin . " It is a reprehensible little effort , commercially conceived out of Tatum ' s notoriety as the man who hit Stingley , a half-boast , half- apologia that does neither , but it is noteworthy for Tatum ' s view of the game he plays and the qualities it fosters . He describes the tactics he has been taught to use to intimidate - no , hurt - the people he plays against . He describes the hurts he has inflicted . There are tales of " knockouts " and " limp-offs , " of ways to drop another man to the ground so hard that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The headline news probably involves his quotes about the Stingley incident - how he was trying to " intimidate " on the play , not trying to intercept the pass - but the most distressing parts are simply when he talks about playing the game . " Early in the first quarter I spotted a wide receiver running a quick slant over the middle , " Jack Tatum writes , describing his first game as an Ohio State sophomore against Southern Methodist . " The receiver was concentrating on making the catch and never saw me coming . He was my first collegiate knockout victim . " Later in the same period , I saw a running back slip over the middle and look back for the pass . He became my second knockout . The 85,000 fans watching the game were delighted . The action was gruesome , but that ' s what the fans love , violent contact . The Ohio State fans loved the action I had provided and so did my coaches . Once again I was a hero . " The book continues with stories like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ describes . There is dirt that covers him . There is dirt that covers me . He plays that way , a lot of players play that way , and I watch and watch again . It is a troublesome thought . Especially since I know I probably will not stop .
