Pete Rose retired from playing baseball on Aug. 17 , 1986 , but neglected to acknowledge the fact to anyone , including himself , for 16 months . Still the manager of the Cincinnati Reds , entitled to go on sporting his old uniform , Rose skipped the valedictory . At the owners ' meetings a few weeks ago , as casually as can be , he let the information drop : " I just wo n't be running , throwing or hitting anymore . " <P> Along with Rose , Tom Seaver , Phil Niekro and maybe Reggie Jackson are approaching this New Year 's Day with that same thought . " Usually , " says Niekro , 48 , meaning every year of the past 24 , " my blood starts flowing as soon as the holidays are over . I do n't know how I 'm going to feel a month from now , or when the summer starts to get hot , or when the World Series comes around . I wonder what it 's going to be like , never again seeing that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <P> Seaver took a stab at holding on last summer by playing in the minors , and lately Jackson has been waffling on his announced plans to leave . They are 43 and 41 years old , respectively . " The compulsion to play this game is something , " Niekro says . " I do n't know how many letters I 've got over the years , how many strangers have dropped by my hotel , how many fathers have offered to pay me money to teach their boys the knuckleball . ' Can you at least show me how to grip it ? ' they say . But I 'd have to take them all out singly to a little patch of ground in the backyard , back to the coal-mining fields in Ohio . " By way of a video , he is contemplating doing just that . <P> Imagining Rose in a perennially clean uniform is more than a little strange . Though he is approaching 47 , he denies having any pangs about quitting . " Managing has been so involving , I feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Anyway , it would n't be fair for me to say I 'm going to miss hitting the ball , because I got to hit it more than anybody . " Just as Henry Aaron 's 755 home runs seem somehow more difficult to keep count of than Babe Ruth 's 714 , Rose 's 4,256 hits will take a while displacing Ty Cobb 's 4,191 as a mystical number in the record books . " Maybe if I was second in hits , games , at bats , doubles , runs scored , five-hit games , I 'd feel differently , " Rose says . " I just wish I 'd made it to 2,000 winning games . I 'm 28 short . " <P> Numbers have always consoled him . In his final appearance in the batter 's box , at twilight in Cincinnati , Rose struck out on three fastballs from Goose Gossage ( " I had two strikes on me before I could get the doughnut off the bat " ) . He also struck out in his second-to-last try . But in the final three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , including his tenth 5-for-5 game , one of 13 records he set that day alone . " People wonder why I did n't pinch- hit myself last season for a ceremonial goodbye , but a manager ca n't play a guy unless that particular guy 's supposed to be playing that particular game , that particular inning , that particular situation . Besides , if all the people who supported me for 25 seasons came to the park one last time , it would have to be Yellowstone Park . " <P> If Pete Rose has a regret , it is that his second son will not remember him as a player . " Ty " Rose recently observed his third birthday .
