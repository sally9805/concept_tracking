Inflation rages on , and everybody is getting angry <P> As cries of alarm filled the air last week over the news that inflation had hit 18% per year , the Carter Administration was orchestrating a symphony of its own responses . " We have reached a crisis stage , " the President declared . Television crews filmed determined officials , sleeves rolled up and ties loosened , working in normally free hours to cut the budget that Carter himself had sent to Congress only a month earlier . As the week began , Cabinet members slogged through snow-clogged streets to their offices for Sunday meetings to draw up the spending cuts that the President had ordered placed on his desk by 8 a.m . Monday . Hundreds of businessmen from all over the country and scores of Congressmen were summoned to the White House for consultations . Rumors raced through Wall Street that , besides striving to balance the fiscal 1981 budget , the Administration would order tight credit controls . <P> Then , just as suddenly , came delays and equivocations . The Administration 's senior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ program would be announced for the time being and that spending cuts for fiscal 1981 , which begins Oct. 1 , probably would total only $15 billion-significantly less than the $20 billion widely touted , and not enough to balance the budget . In fact , though they did not say so , there is good reason to believe that even after all the reductions , the deficit will be almost as large as the $15.8 billion that Carter estimated in the first place . Worse , said the Congressional Budget Office , the deficit for the current year might climb to a stunning $47 billion , more than $7 billion bigger than the Administration 's latest projection . And forget broad credit controls : there will be no outright limits on the sums that banks can lend to businesses , and certainly no restrictions on how much consumers can borrow to buy houses or cars . Only a requirement that consumers pay credit-card bills more speedily-maybe . <P> The Administration had some reason for its caution . Carter 's advisers stressed that their program had to be credible ; they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assurance Congress could accept . That ruled out any immediate major cuts in the most voracious tax-eaters : the major " entitlement " programs , such as Social Security ( $117.9 billion ) , veterans ' benefits ( $20.8 billion ) and unemployment compensation ( $15.6 billion ) . And Administration officials stressed that there has been no final decision on anything , and will not be until shortly before the President makes a major economic-policy speech , possibly this week-though even that is uncertain .
