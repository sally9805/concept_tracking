Painting incredibly large canvases is one popular method - as is being wildly outrageous ; using the brightest of colors ; drawing like a two-year-old child ; pasting anything and everything onto canvas ; and trying to be more photographically exact than anyone has ever been before. // The problem is that these devices have been used a bit too often and are now old-hat . Painting outrageously and drawing like a child on oversize canvases is pretty common these days . And being photographically precise will no longer cause anyone to sit up and take notice. // New devices are hard to come by and difficult to steal , since they are usually so totally identified with the person who first used them . Consider the nerve it must have taken to be the first to hang paintings upside-down . And yet , although Georg Baselitz did it ( and established an international reputation because of it ) , he still has no serious imitators. // No , being different is becoming increasingly difficult . We are running out of ways to be outrageous and ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point where we ' ll have to reverse the process . It may not be long before being mundane and banal will be considered daring , and seeking artistic anonymity will be viewed as the most revolutionary act of all. // Until that time , however , we ' ll have to brace ourselves for one more outrageously ' ' original ' ' scheme after another , and for a steady stream of articles in our art magazines touting each as among the most significant creations of modern man. // It ' s this ' ' one-two punch ' ' that ' s so confusing . One often gets the impression while reading some of our art magazines that the art depicted and the articles written about it were jointly conceived . And , worse still , that the writers saw themselves more as publicists than critics. // The ballyhoo for the new is often beyond belief . No one , least of all the critic , is given time for reasoned judgment . If art critic ' ' A ' ' doesn ' t rush into print with a glowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ' most assuredly will , and critic ' ' A ' ' may well find himself no longer taken seriously . Critics in this world are too often judged , not on the depth and clarity of their insights , but on how militantly they champion the new. // Now , there ' s no doubt that one of the critic ' s major functions is to ' ' run interference ' ' for new art and for art that remains difficult for the general public to understand . We all owe a great debt , for instance , to such writers and critics as Meyer Schapiro , Clement Greenberg , Thomas Hess , and Harold Rosenberg for helping us really to see what we were looking at in the art of the 1945-1970 period . ( And there are several younger critics upholding that tradition today . ) But that doesn ' t mean the critic should descend to the kind of verbal puffery and blatant advocacy that so often passes for art criticism today. // It should be clearly understood that an art critic ' s primary responsibility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best of the new is of secondary importance , and playing the role of press agent should be out of his jurisdiction altogether. // An art critic must not be pressured - as I was some time back by a dealer who refused to give me photographs of a new artist ' s work unless I could satisfy that dealer that I would treat the artist ' ' fairly . ' ' And neither should he be expected to make snap judgments , or made to feel that his reputation will be tarnished if he doesn ' t hail everything new. // One of his most important functions is to detect artists with considerable ( or even great ) skill who have little or nothing to say . And to point out those who ' ve puffed up their talents , or subverted them through gimmickry. // This is more difficult than it seems . Some artists have a genius for creating the illusion that their mediocrity is actually genius in disguise . And that their pictorial pufferies are great works of art . And if this is true of such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Larry Rivers , it ' s also the case with younger artists on their way up , and older ones desperately trying to succeed. // In an art world in which success is everything , and being noticed is of primary importance , the ambitious artist of moderate talent faces a difficult choice . Should he accept himself as he is and hope for the best , or should he do everything possible to stand out from the crowd ? // The latter may mean pushing a currently fashionable idea or form to its logical or ludicrous extreme , or producing work designed to insult the older generation ' s values and ideals . It can also mean striking a dramatically idiosyncratic posture , fashioning a lurid pastiche of current styles , or actually coming up with something genuinely new . But whatever , it must follow certain unspoken but rigid art-world guidelines , chief among them being that it must startle , and must not be likable at first glance. // Most important of all , however , it must present the art world with a dilemma , and force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or a fraud . It ' s a fascinating moment , watching those concerned trying to decide how to cast their votes . And it ' s even more fascinating to note how very few actually make that ' ' decision , ' ' and how many more simply accept the decision of a handful as though it were an official ruling. // But then , that ' s the way it ' s always been . The articulate and concerned few have always determined art ' s direction . And , by and large , they haven ' t done too badly by it. // Here and there , however , mistakes have been made . Artists have come along with such uncommon skills and determined attitudes that the art world has given them status without really thinking too deeply about it. // John Clem Clarke is one such case . His transcriptions of Old Master and 19th-century paintings are unique and often very impressive . Some are particularly interesting for the subtle manner in which Clarke modified the original artist ' s technique , and for their clever surface @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ painting reproduced here is eighteen feet wide ) and technical brilliance. // There ' s no doubt an exceptional talent is at work here . And yet , what is it producing ? My answer , given reluctantly after watching his art and career for a number of years , is that Clarke , for all his talent and skill , has very little to say . And that his huge , impressive , and technically brilliant transcriptions of Old Master paintings are just that : transcriptions , copies , variations , which no amount of verbal justification can turn into significant art . They are fascinating painterly performances , but that ' s about it. // //
