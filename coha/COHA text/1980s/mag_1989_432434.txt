 | Being discarded is painful enough , but when your husband is the Prime Minister of Greece and flaunts his affair in public , the humiliation is almost beyond belief . Here 's how American-born Margaret Papandreou is coping . Imagine that President George Bush suddenly announced that he was leaving Barbara for a Hollywood starlet . Or that Prince Charles officially " called it quits " with Princess Diana . Unthinkable ? Of course ? in modern history no Western head of state has ever " deposed " his First Lady . Yet less than six months ago 69-year-old Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou of Greece did just that when he informed the press that he was divorcing Margaret , his American-born wife of 38 years , mother of his four children , to marry a young woman half his age , often photographed topless . The unprecedented situation has become an international cause celebre ? and left a gracious and intelligent woman publicly humiliated . What , people wonder , does a First Lady do after she 's been " dumped " ? The scandal is all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ First Lady ? she was a genuine partnerin-politics to a man who has been a symbol of democratic hopes and ideals in a country that had too long lived under tyranny . Swept into power in 1981 , the Papandreous were a stunning couple : the dark , virile Prime Minister , whom many compared with the late John F. Kennedy ; his tall , blonde First Lady , with her sunny good looks and political savvy . The Prime Minister initiated extensive social reforms , the cornerstone of which was an emphasis on " family values . " Margaret founded and became president of the Women 's Union of Greece ? and gradually assumed an international leadership role in both the world peace and the women 's movements . As she became a popular , and respected figure to the citizens of Greece , Andreas Pa-pandreou publicly praised ? and took credit for ? his wife 's accomplishments . So it was a shock to the public who adored her when , in 1987 , ugly rumors began to surface . Andreas , it was said , was unhappy with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another turn ? that Andreas was in love with another woman and was planning to ask for a divorce .  | An extramarital " fling " was one thing . " Mistresses " are semi-acknowledged among certain European leaders , and Andreas was known to have had affairs before . A divorce fora man in his position . however , was politically dangerous . What 's more , Margaret . still slender and glamorous at 64. had always appeared to be the perfect political wife ? articulate , outgoing , a strong defender of her husband 's policies . Born Margaret ( " Maggie " ) Chant in Elmhurst , Ill. , she had met Andreas in 1948 when he was teaching economics at the University of Minnesota . Then 25 , Margaret headed a public-relations firm that represented social issues . From the age of 12 , when she helped her grandfather in his campaign for a seat in the State Senate , she had been fascinated by politics , and her heroine was Eleanor Roosevelt . Meeting and talking with Andreas , an admirer of Franklin Roosevelt ? in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was like a feast . " Andreas , then 29 , was a charming , brilliant man from a distinguished Greek political family . His father , George . had been a liberal politician in Greece , and in 1939 , Andreas , then a student , had been arrested and impris- oned for his role in a resistance movement against the military dictatorship . He had subsequently left for America , where he studied at Harvard and became an American citizen . Both Margaret and Andreas were married to others when they met , but they soon divorced . their respective spouses and , in 1951 , became man and wife . They moved to Berkeley , Calif. , where Andreas became chairman of the economics department at the University of California . In the next decade Margaret gave birth to four children : George Jeffrey , Gayle Sophia , Nicholas , and Andreas , Jr . In 1959 , the Papandreou family visited Greece for a long stay . It was then , Margaret has said , that she began to sense that it was Andreas ' " destiny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family moved there permanently . When , in 1964 , his father was elected Prime Minister , Andreas relinquished his American citizenship and won election to the Greek Parliament . In May 1967 , Greece was overtaken by a bloody military coup and Margaret has described that night ? and the year that followed ? as the most frightening of her life . Six thousand Greeks were arrested , including George and Andreas Papandreou . Amid the sounds of screaming gunshots , armed soldiers stormed Margaret 's home , and as officers held guns to her IS-year-old son 's head , arrested her husband . He was imprisoned in solitary confinement with no visitors , except for brief visits from Margaret and his lawyer . Every single night for those many horrifying months Margaret drove to the prison gates at exactly 11:30 P.M. to give a signal of solace and support to her isolated husband ? a lit cigarette . Her loyalty and that daily gesture of love , Andreas has said , gave him the will to stay alive . But she has also been credited with possibly rescuing him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letters of protest to President Lyndon Johnson , who intervened with the Greek junta . Eight months later , Andreas was released and the family went into exile : Paris , Stockholm , Toronto . In Stockholm Andreas had an extramarital affair ? not , according to many reports , for the first time . Now , however , he also admitted publicly that he had fathered a young woman 's child . Margaret confronted her husband then ? as she has with several of his escapades ? and he ended the relationship , assuring her that the woman in question meant nothing to him . After six years of exile , the family returned to Greece . Andreas ' father had died in 1968 , but in 1974 the military junta collapsed and Andreas began  | building his own political party , Pasok . In 1981 he was elected Prime Minister , ushering in a new atmosphere of tolerance , a cessation of violence and harsh police actions . The family home at Kastri , on the outskirts of Athens , became a sort of low-key White House , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Women 's Union she had founded and campaigned for women representatives in government . Andreas . she believed , stood fully behind her efforts . She barely noticed , then ignored , the clues of a developing relationship between her husband and 33-year-old Dimitra Liani , a flight attendant on the Prime Minister 's plane . In the fall of 1987 , the rumors spilled over into full-fledged scandal when the Prime Minister canceled an important ceremony for recent earthquake victims , pleading a heavy workload , only to be seen ? on exactly the date in question ? on an Aegean cruise with Dimitra . He had also apparently obtained an interviewer 's job for the young woman on a state-run television program and appeared as her first guest . And for the first time in the Papandreous ' long marriage , he had moved out of his and Margaret 's home . Margaret acknowledged to the press that her husband was having an affair , but denied talk of a divorce , asserting that her marriage was " very strong , very stable . " She had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relationship with Dimitra had no depth . Andreas moved back home , after promising not to see his lover again . But just a short time later , Margaret abruptly learned that her husband was supposedly so unhappy with her " feminist " projects that he intended to ask for a divorce . She found this out not from him but from a German newspaper account ( which had been planted by Andreas , who was traveling in Germany with Dimitra ) . Publicly , Margaret took the high road and remained silent . Privately , she confessed to intimates her sense of desperation , her shock that Andreas could so disregard his commitment ? not so much to sexual fidelity , but to the long partnership of their marriage . On Andreas ' return to Athens , he delivered the coup de grace : He ordered that invitations to presidential functions no longer bear his wife 's name . While his personal life was being splashed all over the headlines , Andreas was also becoming embroiled in political scandal . The owner of the Bank of Crete , a friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of dollars , much of it state funds . Accused of involvement in the scheme were many Papandreou appointees , leading the Prime Minister to begin @# shuffling and reshuffling members of his Cabinet . Even his most loyal supporters now speculated about his judgment and behavior ? both public and private . Had Papandreou lost his moral compass altogether ? Andreas ' health , too , was a problem , leading his doctor to publicly imply that the Prime Minister 's new " life-style " was not exactly what he had prescribed . And indeed , on August 23 , 1988 , Andreas entered a London hospital for triple bypass surgery . He was accompanied by Dimitra . Photographers were invited to snap pictures of the two lovers strolling hand in hand in the hospital garden . Soon there were other , less romantic photos : Dimitra , topless , cavorting on a beach with friends . On September 17 Margaret issued a statement : " The woman who stood by the side of Andreas Papandreou for 40 years , and with whom he had four children and two grandchildren @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Two days later Andreas countered by formally announcing that he intended to divorce Margaret and marry Dimitra . Margaret , at home in Kastri , was shattered , but now refused to talk to the press . Only in private did she angrily discuss Andreas ' actions as " an abuse of power , " and speculate that her husband may have been jealous because  | she was functioning politically more effectively than he . Indeed , as the humiliations mounted , Margaret remained a model of grace under pressure . When friends suggested she form her own political party , she joked about a similar comedy script she had once dreamed up . She shrugged aside theories that Dimitra had been a political " setup " or that , with Andreas ' illness and , perhaps , fear of death , he was suffering a mental lapse . The lowest point of all came when Andreas took Dimitra to Rhodes for a European Summit Meeting , and actually introduced her to the assembled leaders as the First Lady of Greece . By now raucous " dirty old man " jokes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her work as president of the Women 's Union , many of the people of her adopted land , disillusioned with the Prime Minister , rallied to her support . On November 17 she marched in an Athens parade at the head of the Women 's Union , her blonde head held high . The crowds took up a chant : " Margarita , great Margarita , bring down Andreas ! " " The young people of Greece believe in a certain quality of life and this sorry spectacle offends them , " says Sue Laion Antonion , the Secretary of the Council of Equality . " We trusted Papandreou , followed him . Now we feel a sense of personal betrayal . " Many of Andreas ' top ministers have resigned , and recently his own children wrote to their father begging him to resign as well . New elections are scheduled for next month ( June ) ; no one knows , of course , whether or not Andreas Papandreou will be re-elected . What of Margaret ? Although she has agreed to a divorce , she has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her daughter Sophia by her grandfather and Sophia wants her to stay . Andreas and Dimitra are staying , rent-free , in a luxurious villa owned by a political friend in an Athens suburb . There is still the role Margaret plays as a feminist leader . There is even talk of a role she and her son George may play in a coalition of small parties allied against Andreas . The latest news is that she has been offered a teaching position at the University of Oregon . Her experience has been unique and painful , but those who know her best agree : she is much too strong , much too smart to allow her life to become Greek tragedy ? or French farce . Whatever the future , Margaret Chant Papandreou will not be counted out . Stay tuned for the next chapter of this international soap opera . . . .
