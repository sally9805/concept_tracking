Spider-Man , TV 's Lindsay Wagner , a duck puppet and a character known as Hands-Off Bill are all recent conscripts in the campaign to prevent the sexual abuse of children . Their basic message : some kinds of touching are wrong , and the child always has the right to say so . <P> The 16-page comic book Spider-Man and Power Pack was produced by the National Committee for Prevention of Child Abuse with the cooperation of Marvel Comics . Lindsay Wagner is one of the performers in Touch , a 32-minute film to be shown on Minneapolis television May 1 . Touch , which has been performed nationally as a play for four years , is the creation of the Minneapolis Illusion Theater , a group that specializes in dramas about child abuse . Among its skits are stories about a baby-sitter who tricks a child into disrobing and a man who fondles his granddaughter . <P> WBZ-TV , NBC 'S Boston affiliate , showed a half-hour program last week called This Secret Should Be Told , featuring Therapist-Ventriloquist Susan Linn and her two star puppets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ puppets encourage children to " tell a trusted adult " whenever they have been touched in a peculiar way . <P> Hands-Off Bill is the brainchild of Lloyd Martin , 42 , an ex-policeman who headed the sexually-exploited-child unit of the Los Angeles police department . Using the voice of a small boy , Bill talks to children on a 30-minute audio tape constructed in the form of a radio show . The tape , along with a workbook , is sold for home use . <P> There are " station breaks , " while the young listeners fill out workbook exercises , and scripted phone-in voices of children who talk to Bill about their experiences . Those who complete the workbook can get a certificate that says , " This special person has permission to say no to uncomfortable touching and will tell . " <P> All of Bill 's materials are based on the common finding that most would-be abusers back off quickly if a child issues a firm no . One parent told Martin that her five-year-old , a fan of Hands-Off Bill , said no to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , added the mother , then showed the workbook to the babysitter , who read it and went for therapy .
