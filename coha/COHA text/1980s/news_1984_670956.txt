Computer buffs rooting for the PCjr fervently hoped that the new model would come equipped with 256 kilobytes of memory and a second disk drive . Their expectations were met only in terms of memory , and then only in a roundabout fashion. // Computers , like most of us , never seem to have enough memory . When personal computers first entered the hobby market they came with 2 kilobytes of memory . Then , over the years , 64K became the norm , allowing for some fairly fancy games , word processing and basic accounting software . The next step was to 128K , which did not expand the software possibilities all that much but did allow some refinements in graphics and increased the speed with which some programs ran. // The crucial increase in memory was a jump to 256K , or even to 512 , the kind of memory space in which data base programs such as d-Base III or Power Base and integrated spreadsheets such as Symphony could feel comfortable. // I.B.M. points out that the PCjr ' s memory is expandable to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ method of expansion reminds me of a sweater knit for my college roommate by his girlfriend . Having somehow come out six inches short on the sleeves , she remedied the situation by knitting him a matching pair of gauntlets. // The PCjr ' s memory can be expanded by sandwiching little gray boxes to the computer ' s side . It is clever . The consumer never has to deal with the bare , intimidating circuit board and the static-sensitive chips . Also , the Expansion Attachments ( $325 apiece ) are easy to affix . But once the first extra 128K has been added , the user must add a power expansion attachment ( $150 ) before adding more memory. // Now that the PCjr has been brought up to its full 512K memory capacity , it has become an over-$2 , 000 machine rather than an under-$1 , 000 one , which should leave potential buyers wondering whether they might not be better off simply starting out with the basic PC. // The power expansion attachment for the PCjr has an external power supply just like that of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pint milk container and a lot heavier , so to use the full 512K theoretically available , one will have a computer carrying a Dagwood sandwich of expansion attachments on one of its sides , two transformers suitable for the construction of a barbell and enough wires on the desk to supply a summer cabin with power. // Add to this the fact that when the computer is shut off , the transformers keep humming along unless everything is unplugged . Altogether , the PCjr ' s enhancement is less than elegant. // The software approach employed to deal with the expanded memory is not much better . The PCjr uses version 2. 1 of DOS , the same disk-operating system that controls the operations of its larger sibling , the PC . DOS , the software that directs the handling of information from the applications programs - the tax planners , games and so forth - also controls the printer and other components including , as its name implies , the disks themselves. // Unfortunately , DOS 2. 1 can not deal with the tacked-on memory expanders , so the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PCjr Memory Options onto the regular DOS disk before using most of the programs requiring the extra memory. // On the positive side , the patch also allows the expanded memory to be used as an " electronic disk " on which the program being run can be stored , for the PCjr does not come with a true second disk drive . This pseudodisk enables the computer to run the software more quickly if it is the type of program that normally requires the machine to keep reading information from the disk as it works . But storing data in such a device means that all labors will be lost when the computer is turned off unless the user records them on a real disk before flicking the switch. // Furthermore the plain , unexpanded DOS disk is needed to run some of the applications programs written to use only 128K of memory , so using such programs means keeping two different DOS disks around. // The situation confronting the beginner , at whom this computer is aimed , becomes even more confusing . For example , the computer has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some software with a sharp display and some with an ultrasharp display . The latter , intended primarily to allow for better on-screen pictures , is called the enhanced graphics mode. // The user must instruct the machine which mode to use . Failing to specify the enhanced graphics mode once , an oversight easily made , I ended up with characters possessing all the clarity of a newspaper left out in the rain. // NONE of these problems are beyond rectification , any more than was the PCjr ' s now obsolete original keyboard . Moreover the availability of some programs on peanut butter- proof cartridges instead of disks has many benefits for home and school , markets where I.B.M. hopes to do well . One wishes DOS was available on cartridge as well , so that it would be accessible instantly when the computer was turned on. // Despite its pluses - potential and real - and as much as I like the other machines in I.B.M. ' s PC family , the revamped PCjr has all the earmarks of a lot of intriguing latent design work dropped haphazardly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began with this month ' s announcement of the soon-to-be-available I.B.M. PC AT ( for advanced technology ) is off to a more promising start . The AT is faster than it was expected to be , has more memory than anticipated and , at $4 , 000 to $6 , 000 depending on the configuration chosen , is priced $1 , 500 to $2 , 000 less per machine than had been predicted. // The AT also incorporates the networking capabilities so many business users have been waiting for , making it possible to hook up many I.B.M. PC ' s to work together , enabling several individuals to share information and operations without leaving their own desks. // Whether this will end coffee breaks is doubtful , but it does in all probability mean the early demise of the PCjr . As an inexpensive addition to an office network , it might have found a niche . But now it is the lone PC model that can not be hooked into the AT network. // That seems to leave the PCjr in the unenviable position of being not merely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never good enough to have been released through the regular theaters - will be playing only in the computer industry ' s last-resort sales equivalent of the drive-in : the grade schools. //
