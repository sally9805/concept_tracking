A " very sweet , " " quiet " and " very kind " man who " didn ' t drink " came opening night , said one Bunny , who gave her name only as Lola. // " I felt I was seeing someone ' s dad , " she said . That man , Playboy ' s founder , Hugh Hefner , " didn ' t seem quite as fast as people make out , " she said. // Playboy , the magazine many say helped start the sexual revolution , doesn ' t seem quite so fast anymore in a world where sexually explicit videos are for rent in shopping malls , many people on the street wear less than Bunnies and , on one recent afternoon , a man stood outside the Empire Club , handing out brochures advertising the " all-nude dancers " right around the corner at the Pink Poodle Bar . <> <> Franchised Clubs to Continue // Which may explain why it has come to pass that Playboy is closing its last three company-owned clubs . On July 1 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Los Angeles and Chicago will hang up their cottontails . Mr. Hefner said in a telephone interview from the Playboy Mansion in Los Angeles that the Bunny had become " a symbol of the past. " // Although the magazine continues to sell 4. 1 million copies each month in the United States , henceforth the Bunnies will be a nostalgia act , frozen in time like Mr. Hefner ' s pipe , slippers and black silk pajamas , which hang behind glass in the Empire Club ' s bar . They will live on only at franchised Playboy Clubs , such as those in Japan , Manila , Des Moines , Omaha and Lansing , Mich. // " The Playboy Bunny was and is a symbol of a wonderful time of social and sexual change , " Mr. Hefner said . " A time of play and pleasure " that suggested " life could be more than a veil of tears . " His voice betrayed disappointment , but there was determination , too . Hugh Hefner says he ' s surrendered this Battle of the Bunny to fight a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawn , " he said . " For the better part of a decade , I ' ve been fighting smoke . I ' ve been fighting semantic confusions in which Playboy has been accused of exploitation by people who , in every other area , have the same social-political views that I have . Finally , it all falls into place. " // The Bunny has been done in , he said , by " authoritarian true-believers , " which he characterized as " fundamentalist and right-wing evangelists " and " one limited , radical but very vocal part of the feminist movement . " These groups , which have succeeded in removing Playboy and other " adult " men ' s magazines from many stores and newsstands , hold " a very old , very traditional , puritan view that the mind and body are in competition , " he contended. // " It begins to sound like something I heard when I was a little kid , " he added . " The devil is in the flesh. " // His opponents consider the Bunny costume " a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , for us and for those who applauded us over the years , it is a symbol of sexual freedom , " he said . " You can have it any way you like it . That ' s what we ' ve tried to project. " // Mr. Hefner first proclaimed his " have-it-all " idea in 1953 , when he founded Playboy magazine . The Playboy Clubs were born in Chicago on Feb. 29 , 1960. // " My first thought was to call the waitresses Playmates , " after the magazine ' s nude centerfold subjects , Mr. Hefner recalled , " and have them in short nightie-type outfits . The notion of using the Bunny costume was originally suggested by the girlfriend of one of my executives . Her mother sewed up the first sample. " // That costume , based on the magazine ' s rabbit mascot , caused trouble . In New York , Mr. Hefner recalled , " the license administrator , who was Catholic and had studied for the priesthood , felt the costume was bawdy and wouldn ' t give us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but only after the administrator was replaced . And in Boston , Mr. Hefner continued , " we showed the costume in front of the liquor commission and one of the commissioners literally swiveled around in his chair and wouldn ' t look at the Bunnies . " <> <> Successes in the 60 ' s // Others weren ' t so shy . The Playboy Clubs were a 60 ' s success story . " The growth was so rapid we were opening two or three clubs a year , " Mr. Hefner said. // At decade ' s end , there were about 750 , 000 members of 22 clubs , which included those at Playboy hotels and resorts in Florida , New Jersey , Wisconsin and Jamaica and casinos in Britain and the Bahamas . The club division ' s economic peak was in the 1970 ' s when those casinos were " recirculating petrodollars , " Mr. Hefner said. // But then the rabbit lost its luck . In the mid-70 ' s , Playboy magazine ' s circulation dropped , and many of its clubs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Hefner said . Nightclub trends had also changed , discos became popular and Playboy ' s " men ' s club " image did not appeal to the growing numbers of women in the workforce. // Mr. Hefner believes his empire ' s real problems began a few years later . " Society itself and the Federal Government and government agencies here and in England became more conservative , " Mr. Hefner said . <> <> Licensing Problems // Indeed , those governments fought Playboy , though not always over its social pioneering . In 1980 , the Securities and Exchange Commission charged Playboy with failing to report benefits given to Mr. Hefner and several other company officials . ( The company settled the case without admitting guilt . ) When its licenses were not renewed after violations of British gambling laws in 1982 , Playboy sold its London casinos , which accounted for 85 percent of its pretax earnings . In 1981 , four executives agreed to resign before Playboy was granted a temporary gaming license in Atlantic City , but in 1983 , after continued licensing problems , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s daughter , Christie , joined Playboy Enterprises in 1979 and was named its president in 1982 . Patronage at the clubs was declining . Soon , she was arguing that they should be closed down , according to John Wise , the manager of the three remaining company-owned clubs . In 1984 , he said , the club division lost $3 million. // Those arguments apparently caused tensions between father and daughter . She agreed to give the clubs " one last try - for him , " Mr. Wise said . Then last year , in the midst of planning the new Empire Club as a test to see if the clubs could survive , Mr. Hefner suffered a mild stroke. // " There was no doubt in our mind the name Playboy was no longer hip in big cities , " Mr. Wise said . " If we bought out Lutece and put the Playboy name out front , we could kill it in two months . That ' s how heavy the name is . But it was hard to say , ' Hey , Hef , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' You ' re obsolete. ' " // When the Empire Club opened , its patrons also seemed from another age . " It ' s funny to see them , " Mr. Wise said . " In the 60 ' s , they were swingers . Now they come with their grandchildren . " The Empire Club was losing " six-figure " sums each month , Mr. Wise said , but he would not be more specific . Playboy finally decided to shut all three clubs down. // Although Mr. Hefner says that " a very special time is passing , a time that reflects a lot of our youths , " he sounds almost relieved. // " I ' m not having any sleepless nights , " he says . " If anything , it ' s a little overdue. " //
