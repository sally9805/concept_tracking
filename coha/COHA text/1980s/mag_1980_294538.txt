Shrinks and despair over the shrinking dollar <P> Joseph P. , a technical writer in Manhattan , dropped out of psychotherapy last year to save the $45 weekly fee . Even with that extra spending money , Joseph went into debt , and his psychological condition worsened . Now he is back with the same psychotherapist , going twice a week at $60 per session , * and almost $1,200 behind in his payments . Says he : " I thought therapy was a middle-class frill I could give up to meet inflation . But the economy is so bad I ca n't get through the week without therapy . " <P> According to many psychotherapists , the nation 's economic woes are beginning to have a heavy impact on their practice . One common report : the pressures of inflation are sending many marginally stable patients over the brink . Says Alan Gruber , a psychologist at Social Counselling Associates in Hanover , Mass. : " The people we see would ordinarily be able to cope , but with inflation , they ca n't cope now . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jack Wiggins : " We 're seeing a cumulative effect . When financial problems are added to internal problems , they tend to overwhelm people . " St. Louis Psychologist Norman Matulef reports that patients are now more pessimistic , worried about their own competence and obsessed with money . " Inflation seems to connect more directly with personal dynamics , " he says . " It 's bad enough for those in the ' normal neurotic ' range . For those with more primitive organization in their personalities , it is even more frightening . " <P> One sign of the times is that therapists are resigned to talking more and more about money in sessions with troubled patients . " It used to be that 5% of our conversation concerned economic worries , " says Los Angeles Psychologist James W. Gottfurcht . " Now it is 10% to 20% . " Some therapists have even taken on the role of financial adviser to their patients . Says Manhattan Psychologist Salvatore Didato : " I spend many more hours than I 'd like to trying to help people find jobs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money . " Therapist Margaret Nichols of Atlanta is willing to work out basic budget plans for patients . Says she : " I will do a very reality-oriented kind of assessment . If they need more , I refer them to an accountant . " <P> The first signs of inflation stress are marital spats , increased pessimism , and the growing fear among many men that they are not competent enough to survive the economic rollercoaster . Detroit Psychiatrist Victor Cruz says that it is not unusual for a working man , after being laid off for six months , to seek help for sexual impotence . Says Cruz : " The initial complaint takes the form of sexual insecurity , but the problem is often more related to the lack of being able to provide financially for a wife or girlfriend .
