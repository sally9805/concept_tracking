Three shoestring movies tilt at the Hollywood system <P> Going to an independent American film can be like watching an event in the Special Olympics . Handicapped by budgets as low as $50,000 ( when the average Hollywood movie costs more than $10 million ) , struggling with unknown actors and make-do shooting schedules , independent films demand the viewer 's rooting interest to see them over the rough spots and through the inevitable longueurs . Indulgence has its own rewards though . When independent films clear their high hurdles , they can point to new ways of looking at both cinema and American life and demonstrate that film has other pleasures to offer than giddy farce and teenpix thrills . <P> Susan Seidelman 's Smithereens , made for $100,000 , is a cautionary tale of the Manhattan punk milieu in the tradition of such ' 60s films as Shadows and The Connection . Its 19-year-old heroine , Wren ( Susan Berman ) , has seen it all , done most of it , learned nothing . Outfitted in punk khaki - checker-rimmed dark glasses , red sneakers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peppermint Lounge and puts the make on new wave musicians , who pay about as much attention to her as they would to the framed landscape on a motel-room wall . This Piaf-size waif has big , gaudy dreams ; what she gives and gets is 24-hours-a-day pain , as stark and grating as a dentist 's drill . <P> Sliding from pathos to pathology and back again , Smithereens has the judgmental attitudes of a Hollywood " expose " with little of the craft . For every quirky glimpse of street life ( a ten-year-old boy running a three-card monte scam , a prostitute who will " show you my scar for $5 " ) , there is a derisive stereotype of the working-class drudges who get in Wren 's way . Wren is so determinedly self-destructive that it becomes hard to care about her fate . Nonetheless , Berman does her best to bring this tough , tart Irma la Douce to life . She and Brad Rinn , as a naive Montana boy who offers Wren vagrant hope of regeneration , snipe amusingly at each other , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Lower East Depths . <P> In Vortex , the milieu is not punk but the sensibility is . The film-making couple known as Scott B and Beth B have worked in the New York new wave underground since the mid- ' 70s , shooting on Super 8 stock and exhibiting the results in punk nightclubs . Vortex , made in 16 mm on an $80,000 budget , is their first shot at the relatively big time . Its plot is standard sleuthing in the corridors of power . A Congressman has been killed on orders from a reclusive plutocrat ( Bill Rice ) . Private Eye Angel Powers ( Lydia Lunch ) finds the source of the trouble in Anthony Demmer ( James Russo ) , a tirading troglodyte in a three-piece suit who has made a pathetic slave of the billionaire . While muttering such maxims as " Truth is a dead man 's secret , " Angel zigzags through encounters with craven executives , junkies and a malevolent dwarf bartender toward a fatal rooftop rendezvous with Demmer.            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
