 | Many investors have , by now , gotten wind of the first-quarter mutual-fund score card . Gold funds were dazzling . Those holding health , technology or natural-resources shares won big , as did funds investing in small companies . Stock funds in general got a good year 's worth of performance in three months , though the typical fund still lagged the broad indexes . But betting the future on the immediate past may not be a good strategy for picking a fund . One voice of caution is that of Michael Lipper . Performance reports by his Lipper Analytical Services undoubtedly contribute to this sort of investment behavior , but Lipper calls quarterly results a " weak tool " for forecasting future direction . Adds Robert Puff , vice president of investments for Twentieth Century Investors : " So much attention is placed on shortterm results that a lot of people wind up chasing what worked best last . " Cases in point : Utility funds last year did better than nearly all other groups of equity funds ? up 22.7 percent on average , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Standard &; Poor 's 500 . In the first quarter of 1987 , however , utility funds rose 3.5 percent , and the S &P; 22.1 percent . Comeback of the year Or look at Strategic Silver Fund ? hurt by falling silver prices , Strategic Silver was 1986 's 15th-poorest performer among 1,189 funds tracked by Lipper Analytical Services , dipping 9.7 percent . But in the first three months of 1987 , it was 18th-best , up a stunning 50.6 percent . Strategic 's fortunes rose with the price of silver , up 15 percent during the first quarter . Leroy Brenna , chairman of Strategic Management , is convinced that Peru and Mexico , the world 's biggest producers , will find some way other than mining and selling silver to finance their debts . If that happens , he says , a world shortage is possible . " Silver will outperform any investment over the next three quarters , " he predicts . Brenna may be right , but do n't bet your bankroll on Strategic Silver or , for that matter , any precious-metals fund . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best or the very worst . Normally , after an exciting move , they go quite dull . " If you expect prices to spiral ? a possibility given the weak dollar , a strengthening economy and prospects of a trade war ? consider putting only part of your investment pot in a gold or silver fund , as an inflation hedge . John van Eck , whose Van Eck Gold/Resources soared 64.8 percent last quarter , recommends that investors place no more than 20 percent of their assets in gold . If following yesterday 's leader wo n't work best for mutual-fund investors , what will ? If you 're nervous about a stock market in which prices climbed more than 20 percent in three months and tripled in less than five years , you are in good company . Anticipating a correction of 200 to 300 points in the Dow Jones industrial average , Norman Fosback , publisher of Mutual Fund Forecaster , last week advised subscribers to move 20 percent of assets into money-market funds . Fosback prefers cash to bond funds because of the chance that interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down . Gerald Perritt , editor of the Mutual Fund Letter , suggests investing in funds that are less vulnerable to a general stock-market collapse . He His favorite is the Babson Value Fund , up 22.9 percent in the first quarter . Another strategy is to invest in income-producing stock funds . Stocks paying high divi- dends usually fall less rapidly in a bear market . Perritt 's choice is the T. Rowe Price Equity Income Fund , up 13.5 percent for the quarter . He also suggests vehicles with large cash positions , his favorite being Primary Trend Fund . Half its assets are in cash , half in largecompany stocks . Remarks Perritt : " Any fund with 50 percent cash , I 've got to love . It has limited downside variability and the cash to buy in as prices go down . " Ways to get aggressive Your options are different if you believe the bull 's rampage is still not finished . Now the decision is whether to invest in aggressive funds that buy the volatile shares of smaller companies or in more-conservative funds that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stocks , newsletter publisher Fosback prefers aggressive funds . His picks include Twentieth Century Growth and Vista funds and Pacific Horizon Aggressive Growth . A different tack is appropriate if you subscribe to the notion of market timer Robert Prechter , editor of the Elliott Wave Theorist , that the Dow Jones industrials are on a course toward 3,600 and that the bulk of the market move will be concentrated in Dow-type issues . In that case , consider growth-and-income funds , which tend to invest in bigger companies , or index funds , which invest in a basket of stocks that closely follow a major market index . In what may be a sad commentary on mutualfund managers , the majority of stock funds have failed to beat the S &P; 500 index over the past five years . Unfortunately for those who want to mimic the Dow industrials , no fund exclusively invests in those 30 stocks . But funds offered by Vanguard and Colonial emulate the S &P; 500 , while several companies sell funds that invest only in the more exclusive universe of the S &P; 100 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with those whose 15-year records , rather than latest results , are outstanding ? proof that they have prospered in good markets and withstood bad ones . You wo n't find Fidelity Magellan , Mutual Shares , Twentieth Century Growth and the Evergreen Fund ? ones that pass this test ? on the list of big first-quarter winners , but they come through in the long haul . The exception is International Investors , a gold fund run by John van Eck . It shows up on the top-25 lists of the past 15 years , five years , one year and quarter . A $1,000 investment in the fund on March 31 , 1972 , is now worth nearly $19,000 . That 's consistency but , unfortunately , no guarantee of future success .
