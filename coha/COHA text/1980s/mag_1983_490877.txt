THE TALK OF THE TOWN Notes and Comment WE have just heard from an old friend : Fifty years ago , on March 4 , 1933 , Franklin Delano Roosevelt was inaugurated President of the United States for the first time , and I was there , in the crowd . ( This was the last of the March 4th Inaugurations ; ever since , they have taken place on January 20th . ) I was eighteen , and I drove from college in Baltimore to Washington in a battered Ford owned by a classmate ; the mere fact that he owned a four-wheeled vehicle gave him the appearance of being exceedingly rich . The times were desperate . Thirteen million Americans were out of work ( including my own father ) ; thousands of families were living in makeshift shacks in our greatest cities ; farmers were rioting to prevent foreclosure of their land and homes ; hunger was commonplace ; and every bank in the nation was about to be closed . I was lucky : I had a scholarship that credited so many hours of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was young and healthy and had my share of dreams . The day was ominously overcast , and became more so as we approached Washington , forty miles south . Thick dark clouds hung over us ; I was certain it would rain , and rain heavily . We had no tickets or credentials . The idea was to get as close as possible to the Capitol 's East Front , within sight of the Inaugural stand , and find a citizen 's perch for the ceremonies . My friend at the wheel knew nothing of the complexities of Washington traffic , and we drove around the city 's circles and broad boulevards trying to find a place to park . Soldiers and policemen were everywhere ; flags and bunting hung from every lamppost . But there was no hint of festivity in the air . Small knots of people had begun to line the sidewalks ( it was late morning ) , but for the most part they appeared dispirited and sullen . We parked not very far from the Capitol , on a quiet , tree-lined street with neat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a poor , black neighborhood . I was dressed For the day in the clothes of the time : a dark-blue vested suit ( no jeans , of course ) , a long dark winter overcoat , and a snappy gray fedora with a huge brim . ( The suit , as I recall , was a hideous shade of blue , and had come with two pairs of pants , for thirty-two dollars . ) In my pocket I carried binoculars . We worked our way fairly close to the Capitol before being stopped by a Marine guard . With extreme amiability , he asked for our tickets . He then gave us a friendly wink and pointed at a nearby icicle-laden , leafless tree . My friend and I scrambled into the tree and surveyed the special nexus of the nation that spread out before us . The white dome of the Capitol was gray , partly obscured by wisps of fog . The official grandstand was filling up with top-hatted dignitaries , all bundled up against the expected downpour . There must have been a hundred thousand people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first time , I examined my neighbors in our particular tree , each on a separate hare limb : an elderly gentleman in rumpled and ancient green tweeds , with patches ; a beautiful red-headed young woman wrapped in a skimpy coat of rabbit , or of some other unfortunate domestic animal ; a woman of indeterminate age who can best be described as dressed in rags , and whose face was lined with worry and pain . For the moment , at least , we were precariously snug in our tree house , waiting For a President to be inaugurated . President or no President , I had a hard time taking my eyes off the redhead ; we subsequently became close friends . The ceremonies were scheduled to start at noon . Noon came and went . The crowd was strangely silent . One could sense the unease . Rumors began to spread through the crowd , called up to the tree people by the less fortunate groundlings . Rumor : A mob some-where along Pennsylvania Avenue had broken through police lines and sur-rounded the car containing President Hoover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spot-ted along the route of the cavalcade from the White House to the Capitol . Rumor : Roosevelt had been wounded by an assassin 's bullet , perhaps fatally . The lady in rags prayed quietly in the tree : " No more trouble , please , God . No more trouble . " The man in the patched tweeds said that he had known all along that something terrible was going to happen on this day , and that one man 's leaving office and another man 's taking over would have no effect : only revolution would turn things right side up , once and for all . Nonsense , said the redhead ; have a little faith , and do n't fall out of the tree . Suddenly , there was a stirring in the crowd . The red-coated Ma-rine hand directly in front of the grandstand began to play . I pulled out my binoculars and focussed straight ahead . President Hoover , glum and downcast , appeared and took a seat in a leather armchair to the left of the rostrum . A sound like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away , through the giant center doors of the Capitol , appeared the President-elect . His face was totally without color . He made his way , painfully and slowly , along the ramp leading to the rostrum , leaning heavily on the arm of his son James . He seemed to be drawing on bottomless reservoirs of physical and mental strength to make the short journey to the rostrum and the Presidency . The crowd held its collective breath . I doubt whether anybody , at that moment , knew that he was carrying ten pounds of heavy steel around his crippled and wasted legs . I spotted the white-bearded Chief Justice , Charles Evans Hughes . He was wearing an odd black skullcap . As he delivered the oath of office , Roosevelt repeated every word of it in frighteningly solemn tones . Once power had passed into his hands , he seized it kinetically , with a vigor and force that stunned the throng . Both hands firmly gripped the rostrum . " This is preeminently the time to speak the truth , the whole truth , frankly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and unforgettable voice . " This great Nation will endure as it has endured , will revive and will prosper . So , first of all , let me assert my firm belief that the only thing we have to fear is fear itself  --  nameless , unreasoning , unjustified terror which paralyzes needed efforts to convert retreat into advance . In every dark hour of our national life a leadership of frankness and vigor has met with that understanding and support of the people themselves which is essential to victory .... Yet our distress comes from no failure of substance . We are stricken by no plague of locusts .... Plenty is at our doorstep , but a generous use of it languishes in the very sight of the supply . Primarily this is because rulers of the exchange of mankind 's goods have failed through their own stubbornness and their own incompetence , have admitted their failure , and have abdicated .... The money changers have fled from their high seats in the temple of our civilization . We may now restore that temple to the ancient truths .... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it lies in the joy of achievement , in the thrill of creative effort .. .. Restoration calls , however , not for changes in ethics alone . This Nation asks for action , and action now . Our greatest primary task is to put people to work . This is no unsolvable problem if we face it wisely and courageously .... We do not distrust the future of essential democracy . The people of the United States have not failed .... They have asked for discipline and direction under leadership . They have made me the present instrument of their wishes . In the spirit of the gift , I take it . " The crowd had come to life . It shouted approval . Roosevelt , still holding tightly to the rostrum , gave no sign of satisfaction . His expression was as grim as when he had started to speak . The ceremony was over . " I think we 'll live , " said the redhead as we climbed down from the tree . The man in tweeds burst into tears . " You know something ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " For many years , I have kept a tattered bulletin board in the kitchen , every inch covered with tacked-up addresses , memos , cards from loved ones , stray quotations from Shakespeare and Yeats ( life-sustaining forces ) . Among them is an old , pockmarked newspaper photograph of F.D.R. leaning on a cane and listening intently to two ragged men who appear to have stopped him somewhere . I have no idea where the picture came from , but it is one of my priceless treasures . One of the men is small and scrappy-looking . His hands are in his pockets , and he is leaning into Roosevelt 's face . The other man , larger and older , is wearing an ancient greatcoat , and is unshaved . Roosevelt 's gray hat is somewhat smashed . He is being attentive to every word that is being said to him . The caption reads , " He knew how to listen . " Since that far-off Inauguration , I have learned that the family Bible on which Franklin Roosevelt took the oath of office lay open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And now abideth faith , hope , charity , these three ; but the greatest of these is charity . " ? ? The Mountain Gorilla AROOM on the second floor of the Harvard Club ' was noisy and cheerful the other evening . Scores of people had gathered for the fourth forum of the Animal Research and Conservation Center ( ARC ) , to hear , and see , a report on the mountain-gorilla population of the Virunga region of central Africa , which straddles the borders of Rwanda , Zaire , and Uganda . " There are only three kti 111 , W MARCH 7,1983 remaining populations of Gorilla gorilla beringei , which is one of three subspecies of the gorilla , " we were told by Dr. Archie Carr III , the assistant director of the ARC . " But even though there has been a lot of interest in its plight we did n't expect such a big turnout as this . Interest in the mountain gorilla is obviously pretty high . Some people we 'd naturally expect to be here . There 's William Conway , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he 's very supportive . And I see that Harold Coolidge has come ; he 's practically the dean of world primatology . But so many other people ! It 's encouraging , to say the least . " Quickly , Dr. Carr sketched the history of the ARC . The ARC had held three previous forums of this sort at irregular intervals , he said , he himself having provided the material for the first one , when he gave a talk about the harrier reef of Belize , a spectacular formation of coral . " At our second forum , Professor Stephen Kellen , of the Yale School of Forestry and Environmental Studies , spoke to us about public attitudes toward conservation , with emphasis on social factors in the preservation of endangered species , " he continued . " And at the third we heard Dr. Timothy Clark on the research-and-recovery project for the black-footed ferret of Wyoming . We support that project : the ferret is a gravely endangered animal , despite its having had a lot of babies recently . This mountain-gorilla project of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ? " Two of the ARC 'S people , he added  --  Amy Vedder and William Weber ? had spent more than two years in Africa collecting material and then two years at the University of Wisconsin collating their data . " We 're now negotiating a project to send them back , " he said , " but it 's not complete yet . " No doubt everybody in that chatting crowd remembered the tragic story of Digit , the mountain gorilla with which the field researcher Dian Fossey had shared a unique experience years ago when she was observing the species . We had watched on the TV screen the historic moment when the gorilla , after some days of seeing Dr. Fossey on the fringes of the group , actually moved close enough to her to touch her and be touched in return . It was the first recorded evidence of such an encounter between a wild gorilla and a human being , and , among other things , it proved that human beings THE NEW YORKER need not assume that wild gorillas are always ferocious , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been killed by poachers , sacrificing himself to defend his band . This story and the gloomy statistics of the general shrinking of the mountain-gorilla population made the outlook for the species bleak . Eventually , we were requested to move into the next room , where chairs were arranged before a lecture plat-form and a screen for slides . The meeting was opened by Dr. Conway , the general director of the Bronx Zoo , who introduced Dr. George B. Schaller , the director of the ARC . Dr. Schaller , who is well known for his work on  --  among other species the mountain gorilla , told us that he and his wife had started observing the gorilla a quarter of a century ago , and that this work had been carried on by others to the present day . The mature male gorilla , he reminded us , is known as a silverback , because the hair on its back turns gray or white . Next , he genially introduced the man he referred to as our own silverback , Dr. Harold Jefferson Coolidge . Dr. Coolidge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acknowledge the affectionate applause that followed . Amy %Tedder and William Weber , continued Dr. Schaller , made an excellent team , because in addition to observing the animal itself they had studied conservation by considering the social factors that have set man against the gorilla . Miss Vedder is concerned with the animal , Mr. Weber with the situation of the gorilla among the human beings surrounding it . " Without more ado , " Dr. Schaller concluded , " I call on Amy first . " Miss Vedder spoke briefly of the gorilla 's daily routine  --  how it eats voraciously soon after waking up , takes a rest in the middle of the day , and then begins to eat again . We saw accompanying slides of mountain gorillas  --  animals with longer hair than their cousins the lowland gorillas  --  eating , sleeping , and playing , the younger ones wrestling and romping. ' /e heard about their family grouping around the silverback . Then Miss Vedder gave way to Mr. Weber , who told us that the Truman population of Rwanda is increasing at an alarming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He showed us pictures of crowded pathways and streets , and long-distance pictures of mountainsides under intensive cultivation . " The population density of Rwanda is now two hundred and thirty to the square kilometre , " he said impressively . We looked back at our notes on Miss Vedder 's talk . In the nineteen-sixties , in the Virunga region , there were between four and five hundred gorillas living in the wild . In 1973 , there were approximately two hundred and seventy . In 1978 , there were two fewer , but  --  and here there sounded a note of hope , however forlorn  --  the observers counted more infants , and in 1981 , though there had been a slight decline in the over-all population , there was in Rwanda , at least , a slight increase . This , Miss Vedder and Mr. Weber think , is due to recent efforts to instill a new outlook into human Rwandans . Propaganda work , especially in the schools , has had its effect . The children get booklets with pictures of the gorilla labelled " Ingagi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the booklets are popular , and so are lessons that are given now and then , and illustrated with slides , about the animal and its attractions . Adult Rwandans have learned that the tourist industry is better for the commonweal than slaughter of the few animals left , which merely enriches poachers . Mr. Weber showed slides of local guards armed and ready to defend their gorillas against poachers . There were pictures , too , of a few hardy tourist guides who had learned to approach the gorilla bands carefully and peacefully . All in all , we left the hall with an upbeat feeling most unusual in connection with this subject . Just possibly , we reflected , Digit has not died in vain . Guitar String ROSE AUGUSTINE 'S factory , situated several floors above a cuckoo-clock manufacturer in a twelve-story building on West Twenty-fifth Street , churns out thirty miles of guitar string a day . ( " I used to tell people three miles , but then I refigured it and found I 'd messed up a decimal place , " Mrs. Augustine told us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half days the lathelike machines in Mrs. Augustine 's factory can produce a guitar string long enough to he held at one end by the residents of Rochester , New York , and at the other end by the citizens of Cleveland , Ohio , and strummed . Actually , the strings at Mrs. Augustine 's factory are cut in lengths of between thirty-eight and forty-one inches , depending on how far up the neck of the guitar they will he tied . Still , that 's a lot of string . " There are more guitar players in this world than you 'd ever dream , " Mrs. Augustine said happily . Once the strings are cut , they arc sorted accord ing to width and packed in plastic bags , which are then heat-sealed and packed in cardboard cartons , which are then stacked at one end of the workroom . " I can tell by looking at the height of a stack of boxes what we have enough of . When a pile gets too high , I tell them to switch to another width of string , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the volume of her string production , and her less than scientific approach to inventory , one might he tempted to worry over Mrs. Augustine 's ability to succeed in the great hurly-burly of American capitalism . If one did that , one would he wasting one 's time , for Mrs. Augustine  --  her firm 's only salesman  --  is an industry leader . Her Augustine Imperial ( " The Superior Concert String ... Played by the Great Masters " ) sells and sells and sells , as well it should , for it is a direct descendant of the first guitar string of the modern era , which was designed by Mrs. Augustine 's late husband , Albert  --  sometimes referred to as " the rescuer of the classical guitar . " " Strings used to he made of silk and gut , " Mrs. Augustine explained . " But during the Second World War there was a terrible shortage , because all the warring nations were using all the top-grade silk and gut for sutures . There was almost nothing left for instruments . My husband , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the war-surplus stores on Canal Street , and he saw these big spools of rejected nylon . It was used MARCH 7,1983 then  --  and still is  --  as fishing leader . Most of the nylon on the spool would he rough , but he could usually find enough smooth sections to make some strings . Shortly afterward , he was with Andr  --  s Segovia , the greatest guitar player . My husband saw that Segovia had a nylon string on his guitar , and learned that some man from du Pont had given it to him . But only one . Segovia told my husband he would he in seventh heaven if he could get the first three strings in nylon . " With a rebuilt binocular grinder  --  also procured on Canal Street  --  Mrs. Augustine and her husband set to work making strings . They surprised du Pont with their request for nylon ; soon after the war ended , company officials had approached most of the established stringmakers , who , for reasons of professional conservatism and self-interest ( " A nylon string will last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an hour before you need a new one , " Mrs. Augustine said ) , had told du Pont that the new material would n't work . But work it did . " It was a godsend . It was the first real change in stringmaking in hundreds of years . My husband is credited with being one of the leaders of the guitar revolution , even though he did n't really want to make strings . He wanted to make , and always did make , guitars . " Mrs. Augustine was in on the business from the beginning , helping out in their first workshop , which was in the basement of the building they lived in , on Central Park West . ( " It was strictly illegal to have a factory in a residential building , so we had all these lights rigged up to warn us if an inspector came by , or anything . " ) As her hus-band 's health gradually declined , Mrs. Augus-tine became more and more important to the business . When her hus-band died , in 1967 , she took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her other work , as a science teacher in Bayside and East Harlem public schools . " When I first stopped teaching , I wanted to do social work , " she told us . " But I found that all they wanted was nay pres-ence , my warm body on the spot , and not my THE NEW YORKER. brains . It just seemed a social-butterfly sort of thing . So I concentrated on the business . " Hard-nosed , but not too hard-nosed ( " ' the greatest asset has been that it 's not a do-or-die thing with me . I 'm not desperate about the dollars and the pennies " ) , Mrs. Augustine has built the business to the point where she has received more than one offer to buy it out . And still her empire grows . Mrs. Augustine sponsors a guitar-concert series at the 92nd Street Y , and she recently bought Guitar Review , a classy quarterly with articles like " Aristocratic Patronage and the Spanish Guitar in the Seventeenth Century " and " The History of Apoyando . " Finally , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the guitar ? " Mrs. Augustine replied , with a smile . " I hate the guitar  --  I told Segovia that years ago . Segovia lived with us for years , and I would n't let him give me lessons . I go to three or four concerts a week  --  it 's important for the business . And I like the guitarists very much . But I do n't really enjoy the concerts . I worry too much . Not about the strings breaking but about the artists , the music . The guitar is a very difficult instrument to listen to . The volume is very small . Personally , I do n't believe that it should be played in large concert halls . I have an awful lot of guitar records , but I do n't go much out of my way to listen to them .

Dustin Hoffman 's coiffure for the movie " Tootsie " was created by a hairstylist named George Masters .

Many other hairstylists also consider themselves shy . If you want your family and friends to sit up and take notice of a new , improved you , you will change your hairstyle . Allen Edwards is responsible for giving Raquel Welch a new look . " We talked for a long time about cutting off her hair , " Mr. Edwards told us . " Short hair is more appropriate for Raquel at this stage of her career . So , finally , one day she came in and said , Let 's do it . ' Raquel actually cried when 1 cut her hair , but she loves the result . " Cutting hair is an art .

You should learn to trust your personal hairstylist . Lori Davis , who dyed Jane Fonda 's hair red for " The China Syndrome , " and who streaked Miss Fonda 's hair for " On Golden Pond , " is leaving Miss Fonda 's hair natural for her forthcoming TV movie , " The Doll-maker . " Arlene Dahl is as beautiful as ever . " I 've always believed that beauty begins at the top , " she said . Toni Tennille is also as beautiful as ever , but now her hair  --  formerly brown and straight  --  is ash blond and wavy . " It 's so important how you feel when you go out there and everybody 's looking at you , " she said . You should dare to be different .
