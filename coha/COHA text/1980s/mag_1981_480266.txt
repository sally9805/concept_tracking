THE DAY AFTER the presidential election the largest " alternative investment " conference ever held took place in New Orleans . People mainly have gold and silver in mind when they talk about alternative investment conferences ? gatherings that only a few years ago were regarded as superstitious conclaves . Goldbugs , who predicted the debasement of currency and salvation only through the purchase of bullion , were dismissed with the same summary air with which science dispatched witchcraft . The experts , the gentlemen with their econometric forecasts or their degrees from the Harvard Business School , were in control . But times grew worse and gold prices soared , Witchcraft ? or whatever it , was ? started to look good , and investors , in despair over the government 's inability to do any good to the economy , began looking for ways to protect their money . The meeting in New Orleans could be regarded as an alternative , not just to conventional investment , but also to mobs at the Treasury door . The message was clear : people no longer trust the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? the original ' hard-money ' conference and still the best , " it was sponsored by the National Committee for Monetary Reform , whose chairman is James U. Blanchard III . It lasted for four days ; included general sessions , workshops , seminars , and 162 exhibitor displays ; boasted financialplanning centers , an International Investment Consultation Center . spouses ' programs , and one very impressive gold bar on display . Jim Blanchard held his first convention in 1974 , and 700 came . In 1980 , 4,732 attendees paid a registration fee of between $345 and $445 . It was no doubt the biggest ? perhaps the best . Among the speakers were Dr. Martin Anderson , a domestic-policy adviser to President-elect Ronald Reagan ; James E. Akins , a former United States ambassador to Saudi Arabia ; Frederic Bogart , senior vice-president of the Republic National Bank of New York ; Harry Browne , author of New Profits from the Monetary Crisis ; Nicholas Deak , chairman of Deak-Perera 's precious metals and foreign-currency exchange : James Dines , " the original goldbug " ; Nelson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , head of a private investment company in New York and at the time of the conference a dark-horse candidate for the Treasury secretaryship ; Howard J. Ruff , publisher of Ruff Times ; Louis Rukeyser of " Wall Street Week " ; Andre Sharon of Drexel Burnham Lambert ; and George F. Will , newspaper and magazine columnist . Not least among the stars was Franz Pick , the well-known scourge of orthodox financial thought and the publisher of Pick 's World Currency Report and Pick 's Currency Yearbook . At an earlier New Orleans conference Pick received a warm round of applause when he suggested that then Treasury secretary Michael Blumenthal should be jailed for " crimes against the dollar . " This year Blumenthal , still at large , was a speaker too ? although not on the platform at the same time as Pick . Well , it 's easy to tease . In fact , it is difficult to write about alternative investment conferences , goldbugs , and hard-money advocates without sounding like a condescending dropper-in from the Eastern Establishment ? on one 's way to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in mind that these conferences would not exist at all if even a modicum of economic sanity prevailed in the land . In more placid times ? without those twin curs of taxation and inflation nipping so voraciously at our heels ? most of the conference attendees would be more contentedly and surely more profitably engaged in attending to their businesses at home . Today , however , it is hard for a man to work and save and still keep the fruits of his labor . Inflation and government conspire to take it away from him . Perhaps the best summary of the wage-earners ' plight was made by Andre Sharon , an authority on gold . In times of such economic uncertainty , he said , the object of personal investment is simply this : to protect what you already have , in terms of after-tax purchasing power . If you can manage to do that , he said , you are doing very well . Most , in fact , can not .

Hiding money in gold S RORTLY BEFORE going to New Orleans I had an opportunity to ponder the reasons for the hard-money movement . At a book-publication party in Washington I met a senior official of the Treasury Department , one of G. William Miller 's men . I said something about the popularity of gold ? all that money flowing out of its preordained , officially sanctioned channels of revenue , such as savings accounts or stocks and bonds ? into a golden but sterile sump of wealth . I also told him about the upcoming convention in New Orleans , where all the goldbugs would be gathered together under one roof . He was too polite to display any expression other than a slight wrinkling of his nose , as if sensing a distasteful smell . The Treasury people do n't like gold , perhaps understandably , considering they sold more than half the U.S. gold reserves between 1950 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of attitude there has been ! Only fifty years ago gold represented probity , reliability ? the solidly respectable , sable-trimmed banker . Then John Maynard Keynes called it a barbarous relic , and that has been the last official word or thought on the subject . The Treasury official I was speaking with conceded that there was a problem with inflation , which eats up people 's savings before they get a chance to spend them ; he could hardly blame people who sought protection against it . He seemed momentarily at a loss ? it was not easy in the fall of 1979 to be a Carter administration official with the task of defending economic policy . Then the man said something that made me realize why so many traditional investors are resorting to gold . He said that while he did n't object to people buying gold , it was nevertheless a shame that their " profits " from such purchases were untaxed . Current federal law is such that if you earn money and then save some of it , the interest on your savings is counted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " taxed again at an even higher rate than when you earned it in the first place . Thus savings are taxed twice . If we assume that the interest rate is equal to the inflation rate , it would be possible for the saver , by compounding interest , to keep up with inflation . ( The inflation rate itself compounds annually , of course . ) But the double tax on interest income makes this mathematically impossible . Government tax policy plus inflation erodes what a wage earner prudently sets aside in a savings account . This is foolish because it reduces the rate of savings . Investors withdraw their money from banks to buy real estate , collectibles , municipal bonds , or gold ? anything to avoid the double taxation on savings interest . Some economists have referred to this flight of money as " capital going on strike , " because for the most part these popular investments produce nothing . They do , however , hide money . Besides this , the government 's approach has encouraged consumption as the best hedge against inflation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some gold , even a color television ? because tomorrow your money will be worth less and the item will cost more . As a nation , the United States ranks behind Germany and Japan in its rate of saving , and its capital stock ? in such vital industries as automobiles and railways ? is wasting away . Nevertheless , the government advocates tax policies that reduce savings and go against the best interests of the nation . T THE HEART of the hard-money movement , then , is the citizen 's determination to protect his money against the depredations of government . As the government moves increasingly into the business of taking money away from some people and giving it to others , defense against predatory policies becomes ever more urgent . The extent to which citizens and investors are responding to such government policies can be measured by the increasing number of financial guides available . There has always been a market for books that explain how to achieve overnight success in real estate , stocks , or gold bullion , but more and more of these accounts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The point is not to make a million but simply to stay ahead of inflation . It is easy to dismiss such works as religious tracts of a sort . As there are hundreds now to choose from , many will simply fulfill the prophecy of the reader . But whatever else they may do , almost all these financial guides dismiss the wisdom of orthodox economists . Traditional analysts , like government advisers , assume things will remain pretty much as they are . Inflation may go higher or drop off a bit , but it will always be between 5 and 20 percent . Likewise interest rates will always remain between similar mileposts . The hard-money advocates , on the other hand . scoff at the notion of relative economic stability . In short , they predict financial doom , although they disagree among themselves about the precise direction of the road to ruin . Some insist inflation will get out of hand and approach the levels familiar in Argentina or Israel . Others forecast a sharp contraction of the money supply , leading to a dramatic reduction of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ value of paper currency ; the hard-money people do not . Survival texts I N " CRISIS INVESTING , " a best seller ( despite the possible handicap of publication by a relatively obscure house , the Stratford Press ) , Douglas Casey makes the case for gold as an effective form of armor against the government 's reach : Gold , as cash , is invisible . That means it is not engraved with serial numbers , or your social security number . if you own it , you are the only one who knows that you own it . This is a most important advantage when it comes to keeping what you have . Of course , there is another crucial point about gold . It can not he created by government . Governments can turn paper into money , but they can not turn anything into gold . Golden money thus eludes debasement by government . In short . the ownership of gold allows people to remain independent of governments . ' Unable to perform the alchemy necessary to transmute paper or ink into gold , governments have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give the title of another obscurely published but widely read book by Antony Sutton . Gold was derided , called names ( " emotional , " " illogical , " " barbarous , " " a threat to free institutions " ) , * The more extreme goldbugs advise you to own actual gold , not certificates or gold stock , and to keep it at home . Franz Pick warns : " Experience has taught us that bank vaults are not accessible to owners of safety deposit boxes from 3:00 P.M. Friday to 9:00 A.M. Monday . Devaluations generally take place during this period . Do I have to say more ? Do not store your gold or silver in a safe-deposit box because there 's a chance that one historic Monday morning the box will have a red seal on it and may be opened only in the presence of government agents . " Pick sounds extreme , but he has lived through the destruction of numerous central-European currencies and edicts against gold ownership , so he may be merely prudent . and driven from the international monetary system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1971 . The International Monetary Fund sold off one third of its gold in the late 1970s . And the Treasury for a while held irregular gold sales in a notably unsuccessful attempt to destabilize the gold price , the thermometer registering the public 's distrust of government . Despite official discouragement , gold forced its way back ? de facto if not de jure ? into the monetary system in the late 1970s . " When the substitute gold-backed currency disappears , people turn to the real thing , " Harry Browne points out in New Profits from the Monetary Crisis , one of the best books of the " crisis investing " genre . Millions of refugees from inflation and the tax code saw gold as a haven , the demand for it rose more rapidly than the supply , and so its price soared . ' Until 1971 , gold 's price was controlled by the government . Since commodities constrained by price controls will tend to rise in value once the controls are lifted , anyone who bought gold coins in 1970 had only to await the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rare investment opportunity depended on appreciating that the government 's sale of its gold at $35 an ounce constituted a ceiling on the gold price , not a floor . Some sages , such as the chairman of the House Banking Committee , Rep. Henry Reuss , and Paul Samuelson. the Nobel prize-winning economist , suggested that when the government stopped selling gold , its price would drop even lower . But the European central bankers who were buying this gold and thus valued an ounce of it at more than $35 would surely have constituted the more reliable guide to potential investors a decade ago.removal of the price controls ? to see his investment pay off handsomely . Today it is a different matter . Gold rose to $875 an ounce in January 1980 , then dropped below $500 , and through most of 1980 stayed in the $600 range . Is it now overvalued or still undervalued ? If you buy it now to protect yourself against inflation , are you instead going to lose everything ? Does the present price incorporate anticipated inflation , making it highly vulnerable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ price even now " building a base , " as the brokers say , getting set to move even higher ? The ever-growing number of hard-money conferences that have sprung up in the past five years are designed to address such questions as these . A CCORD1NG TO ONE estimate there are now about thirty such conferences a year . Some of them are held " offshore , " in Hong Kong , for example , where the speakers can unburden themselves a little more freely , and where other speakers , such as Harry Schultz , publisher of The Harry Schultz Letter ( to which a year 's subscription costs $258 ) , can show up without fear of interrogation by Internal Revenue agents . ( Schultz appears at " onshore " conferences too , but only on videotape . ) In New Orleans an unusual investment paradox hung like a cloud over the convention at the outset . Most of those in attendance ? their average income , two observers independently guessed , was about $40,000 ? undoubtedly had strong positions in gold . The Republican platform had hinted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ronald Reagan undoubtedly was their man ( if any Carter supporters were present I did n't come across them ) . And now Reagan had won a notable victory . But what if he were to succeed in implementing policies that would indeed bring inflation to a halt ? What would happen to the price of gold ? It would surely plunge ( as indeed it did , a month later ) . This possibility must have made some of the participants nervous . They might be on the verge of winning an ideological victory for gold . but at the same time they would be losing the battle of their own investments . And this was what the markets seemed to be saying . As the convention opened , the gold price dropped by $25 , and gold and silver stocks plunged , while the dollar and the stock market were up . A Pyrrhic victory indeed for those with bullion under their beds ! In the nearby Hilton Hotel I talked briefly to Howard J. Ruff about the future of gold . An articulate , professional performer and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said to be the best-selling finan-cial book in history ? Ruff had just finished taping his weekly television show " Ruff House . " " I could have worked for Carter 's reelection and bought gold on margin , " he said , hastening to add that he had done no such thing . But he knew that four more years of Carter would have sent the metals soaring . Ruff was " hopeful " as a result of the election , but only " mildly so . " Optimism does n't come easily to goldbugs . " The political constituencies will remain the same , " he said , " and there will be more welfare hums like Chrysler . People will turn on Reagan if they do n't get what he promised . " Ruff predicted a gold price of " $2,000 or possibly $3.000 by 1983 , " but in the short run he did n't know where it would go . In fact . he changed his mind on the subject in the few minutes I was with him . He thus managed to embody the confusion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gurus spoke in divers tongues . But the prevailing opinion seemed to be : Hold on to your gold ? just in case things get worse . Reagan will do his best , but in the long run the problems facing him will surely prove insuperable . For years now many of the speakers at this convention have predicted one or another financial disaster , ranging from high inflation to depression , and they have taken steps to protect themselves against one or another of these possibilities . In the process many of them have grown attached to their predictions . The notion that the prophesied disaster might somehow melt away , with wise men arriving unforeseen in Washington to pursue sound and honorable policies , is one that gold-investment newsletter writers and their readers are not yet willing to concede . This is not because they have been looking forward to waxing rich amid the financial ruins of the nation , as the titles of many of their preferred books misleadingly imply ( almost all seem to start with the words How to Profit from ) , but because they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ readers of the unpropitious entrails , rather than dismissed as groundless pessimists . They do not hope for a soft landing in a gold-lined financial fallout shelter , but only that one day they will be able to look back and say : I was right . I saw it coming . Preparing for disaster G OLD MAY %Ha WELL be the 1980s ' economic equivalent of the 1960 fallout shelter . But as a look around the exhibition booths at the New Orleans convention made plain . there is a lot of preparation for disaster under way , strongly reminiscent of the early 1960s . For example , Survive Tomorrow , Inc. asks : " What would you do in the event of : Nuclear War ? Economic Collapse ? Natural Disaster ? Civil Strife ? " They present for your consideration Terrene Ark 1 , " an underground condominium project in beautiful La Verkin , Utah " ( " the entire project is covered with at least 44 inches of earth and concrete for safe fallout protection " ) , and the project even has a " media center @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out to be one of the most distinctive and unexpected features of hard-money conventions , and they were all represented in New Orleans . Ruff gives the idea prominence in his book , where he expatiates on shelf life , soybean meat analogues , and other such matters . His basic message is that when push comes to shove , food is even more important than gold . So get yourself a storage plan immediately . This means laying in , per person , " a one-year supply of food . " The Survival Center , based in Ravenna , Ohio , offered such items as bulk foods packed in polythene buckets ( 45 pounds of garbanzo beans , for example I , water purifiers , 50-hour candles , Aladdin lamps , husky construction Survival Stoves , and even wind-powered generators . It occurred to me that the alternative energy people and the natural food folk and the hard-money crowd could all get together and form an almighty political coalition . They may have more in common than they know . Perhaps they are sending out mutual feelers . But so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arms with Amory Lovins . Before setting off to sample the remaining exhibitors ' wares I met Steven Beckner , the author of The Hard Money Book and a regular at these conventions . " Do n't buy any colored stones , " he warned me . I nibbled some " strawberry ice cream , " a medicine pill-sized dry pellet but quite tasty . Then I tasted a reheated bean concoction and felt quite glad I did not have a ten-year supply to get through . Stamps , diamonds , and art were prominently on display , as were antique guns ( some of which appeared to be in pretty good working order I , many a multihued gem , ads for real-estate deals in Costa Rica , and brochures advertising such items as English Wildcat Quality Crossbows . A book stand was offering more books on Austrian-School economics than I had ever seen gathered in one place . James Blanchard , the conference organizer . told me that he used to read all new free-market economics books when they came out , but that he can no longer keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that hardly any of the books on display bore the imprint of a New York publishing house . I was pondering this and Steve Beckner 's warning about colored stones when I met Thomas Lipscomb , who told me that he was with Times Books , a subsidiary of the New York Times Company . He wore a Rut Times label on his lapel , enabling him to blend in with the environment more easily . ( Oddly enough , the New York Times Company published Ruff 's book . ) I suggested that it was surprising that newspapers and magazines had not paid more attention to the hard-money movement , which seemed , from the evidence of my eyes , to be more extensive than most New Yorkers or Washingtonians might imagine . " Most newspaper editors do n't understand what 's going on here at all , " Lipscomb replied . " Most are still so firmly rooted in the New Deal that they are not aware of the ground swell of interest that has led to dozens of such conferences around the country , made up of affluent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If the editors had some sense of the size of this phenomenon . they might not have been so surprised by the Reagan landslide . Your average newspaper editor , I 'm afraid , is just plain sitting there up to his neck in Keynes and Galbraith . " M ANY EDITORS HAVE in fact only fairly recently discovered Milton Fried- man and his doctrine of monetar ... 0. - ism , which unequivocally lays the blame for inflation on the shoulders of government . You might think , then , that Friedman would be a hero to the hard-money crowd . In fact they are rather suspicious of the man . The problem is that Friedman is anti-gold , like all monetarists ( Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker is another example ) . Friedman knows that governments must be restrained from printing too much money , but he believes that this can indeed be achieved , and inflation defeated , if the monetary authorities will only stick to their money growth targets . Advocates of the gold standard , on the other hand , believe that inflation can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gold . The control of the value of money would work this way : if the Treasury agreed to sell its gold for a fixed quantity of dollars , but then devalued those dollars by printing too many of them , people holding the increasingly worthless dollars would trade paper for bullion at the mandated rate of exchange . Were the government then to persist in printing too many dollars , all of its gold would soon be held in either private citizens ' or foreign hands . The commitment to gold ( and its retention in Fort Knox ) inherent in the gold standard would thus discourage legislators from voting for budget deficits and the monetary authorities from monetizing them . As has been observed , the gold standard is really a cunning scheme that puts effective control of the money supply in the hands of the people rather than the economists . Monetarists can be dispensed with . Friedman has also not endeared himself to the goldbugs by suggesting that if the idea of the gold standard is to link money to some commodity produced by the real economy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The goldbugs have never quite known how to answer this gibe . Lewis E. Lehrman thus made a significant contribution to the conference when he pointed out the fatal flaw in Friedman 's pork-belly argument . When a country is on a commodity standard ( let us say , gold ) , and agrees to exchange an ounce of gold for a fixed sum of money ( say $500 ) , or vice versa , people will obviously labor to produce as much gold as they can . Likewise , on a pork-belly standard , people would try to produce as many pork bellies as possible . Pig-rearing would proceed apace , soon producing so many pigs . and , therefore , pork bellies , that drastic inflation would ensue ; a " bacon inflation . " The remarkable thing about gold , Lehrman 38 then pointed out , is that its distribution beneath the ground is so attenuated that no matter how hard men labor to find it , they are never able to dig it up at rates that exceed the overall growth of the economy . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it from mines " grows over the long run at 2 percent a year , roughly proportionate to the rate of economic growth over long periods . " In other words , gold miners must work hard and efficiently if they are to extract more wealth from the mine than can be produced by some other sector of the economy . Lehrman then raised the possibility that there might be " a providential design " in the existence and distribution of gold , with its numerous qualities making it and nothing else the ideal basis of money ? " it is scarce , storable , measurable , divisible , immutable , transportable and fungible ? ' From Harry Browne , on the other hand , the conventioneers heard the voice of apostasy . " Hard money has become a religious experience , " he said . Gold and silver were fast becoming " icons . " This was okay in 1970 , when gold and silver prices were kept artificially low by the government , but it was dangerous , Browne warned , to persist for too long in any conventional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? s : " Borrow money and pay it back with cheaper dollars . " You ca n't rely on that one anymore , Browne suggested , leaning toward the deflationist , or " crash , " school of economic thought , which grows more pervasive every year at these hard-money conferences . Likewise , said Browne , you ca n't rely too much anymore on " the Holy Trinity " of investment : " Gold the father , silver the son , and Swiss franc the Holy Ghost . " Then he actually recommended stocks , common stocks , as having investment potential . " Stocks used to be beyond the pale at these conventions , " Steve Beckner told me later . Apparently the range of " alternative investment " advice has broadened considerably over the years . The profits of doom HE AUDIENCE MUST have grown confused with all the conflicting advice they heard . Gold was going down , sil- ver up , or vice versa , or neither , or there would be " resistance " at this level , an " upside break-out " at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sell your deutschmarks ! That was one unequivocal warning from Nicholas Deak , who claimed that Germany " will develop the same kind of problems we have had in the past few years . " Inflation , he said , was caused by " our welfare and transfer spending , " and he received a sturdy round of applause when he added : " 1 do n't see why the recipient of welfare should be able to vote , because obviously he can vote for more welfare . " It occurred to me after meeting and listening to a number of the well-known newsletter publishers ? James Sinclair , Eliot Janeway , C. Verne Myers , and James Dines , for example -- that they owed their position as gurus with disciples more to the air of authority they were able to project than to anything particularly brilliant they had to say . Especially puzzling , indeed to my ears barely intelligible , was Eliot Janeway , who described Sen. Sam Nunn as " the most powerful man in Washington . " But Janeway had indeed mastered the histrionic gesture and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to so much inside information that it was surprising he had even one rival guru on the platform . Undoubtedly the best-loved speaker was Nelson Bunker Hunt . Hunt today is the martyr of the hard-money movement ? the one who led the way into silver , only to be ambushed by the Feds the Commodity Futures Trading Commission ) , who increased the margin requirements for silver , thus collapsing the pyramided money of those ( including Hunt ) who had bought on thinner margins than were mandated by the new rules . So Hunt was the martyr , and only when he spoke did all the salesmen and attendants from the exhibition booths come and listen quietly at the back of the hall . He gave no investment advice but preached something close to a sermon , talking of Christian ministers and the evils of pornography and of " police-state controls . " Hunt 's only silver prophecy was enigmatic : he saw one day " a five-to-one gold-tosilver price ratio , " which could of course mean soaring silver or plunging gold . Hunt implied the former , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in January 1980 , the ratio was about fifteen to one ; when lie spoke it was over thirty to one . ) The last on stage was James Dines , who has been recommending gold , as he never fails to point out , since it was $35 an ounce . Dines somehow manages to attract a remarkable amount of criticism , which is odd because he is one of the few goldbugs with a sense of humor . ( " Whatever happened to the First Amendment ? " Dines says , with some justice , in response to the official hostility his investment advice engenders . He has been sued by the New York State attorney general 's office , for example . ) Dines 's forecasting formula can be proved wrong only at the end of the world . At some point in the future , he argues , gold will rise even higher than it is today . Therefore hold on to it . Meanwhile he is bearish on just about everything in sight ? stocks , bonds , utilities ? " All of them out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He predicted a Dow Jones average " below 570 within thirty-six months , " followed by " the worst deflation in history ... a massive contraction of the money supply via bankruptcies . " Collectibles will decline , stamps wither , real estate will show " startling drops , " commodities will sour , oil too will sink ( " the most radical prediction i will make today " ) . The only haven will be the precious triad : gold , silver , platinum . How , then , shall we know when the terrible hour has come , the time to sell even these three ? Dines will know the hour , and he will then and only then transmit to Dines Letter subscribers his Much Vaunted All Out Oneand Only Cold and Silver Sell Signal . " So do n't miss a single issue , " he added superfluously . ( The subscription price is $150 a year . ) " I will be more bitterly criticized for selling at the top than I was for buying at the bottom , " Dines concluded . It was nice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traders around to criticize him . ITH THAT , THE conventioneers went home to ponder their portfolios . What had it all meant ? One participant from Dallas told me that " reassurance " was a big factor . " Back at home you get these ideas about what is happening to the country , and because you 're alone you begin to think you 're going crazy , " he said . " But at a conference like this you meet other people with the same ideas . It reassures you that you 're not just a kook . " Of course , many would say that Dines , Pick , and others ? some of whom raged at the Trilateral Commission as the true source of the nation 's problems ? are just that : kooky . Certainly Dines 's scenario ? everything crashing down about our ears , the money supply vanishing , and the gold price still soaring ? is self-contradictory and impossible to credit . So you begin to think that maybe they are all crazy , until you recall the Council of Economic Advisers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members of this group of prestigious counselors . Almost everything they said seemed to have turned out wrong . Recessions failed to materialize , inflation estimates were invariably wrong . But no one seems to mind because their forecasts emerge from the correct econometric models and are expressed in the appropriate numerology . Overall , I would be surprised to find that the forecasts of Dines and others at the New Orleans convention have been any more misleading than those of the Council . However erratic or contradictory or extreme these people may be , the charge of kookiness collapses once their rivals in Washington are considered . G. K. Chesterton once remarked that when people cease to believe in God they do not then believe in nothing , they believe in anything . Similarly the hard-money conventions suggest that when people cease to believe in the certified experts , experts do n't disappear , they multiply . The loss of faith in the duly appointed economic experts has created a climate of such uncertainty today that almost anvone who can conjure up an air of authority in money matters can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the process .
