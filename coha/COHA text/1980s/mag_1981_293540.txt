" Francis walked by the railings of Green Park , not taking a taxi , still practising the frugality he had developed after his failure to appropriate the dressmaker 's money . It was n't important that the idyll changed again ; what mattered was he had no friend . He 'd gone on holidays with friends , but always there 'd been sulkiness and tears . ' You 're Francis , ' a girl he 'd thought to be sympathetic had pronounced six months ago in Cleethorpes . . . <P> His melancholy deepened as he progressed through the London night . People left a gambling club near Hyde Park Corner , young men in evening dress shouting and laughing , girls laughing also , all of them tumbling into taxis , going on to somewhere else . For a moment Francis hated them . He stopped in his walk , indulging his dislike , listening to the shrill voices , the late-night cries of people determinedly having a good time . He would n't have cared if all of them had been shot down dead , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opened fire in the orange street light . "
