Diana Bowler and Alisa Michaels Metzner , vice presidents at BankAmerica in San Francisco , had a common dilemma . Both had baby girls and did not want to work full time . Yet neither wanted to sacrifice a promising career at the bank . With the approval of their bosses , they came up with a solution : sharing one management job and salary . Bowler , 32 , and Michaels Metzner , 34 , were a good match because both worked in strategic planning and analysis . Michaels Metzner now comes in seven hours a day on Monday , Tuesday and Wednesday , and Bowler , works a similar schedule on Wednesday , Thursday and Friday . The overlap day allows them to coordinate their work . <P> The rewards are professional and personal . Says Bowler : " It 's the best of both worlds . " For BankAmerica too , which pays the two part-timers the equivalent of a single 35-hour weekly salary but gets much more work than that from them .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
