For every winner there has to be a loser . Honest . Lajoie ' s Law , you can look it up . If there ' s a hero squinting into the glare of the minicam lights , you can bet that somewhere on the premises a goat will be sitting at a locker , contemplating his navel . Whaddya mean goats don ' t have navels ? Opening day at Fenway Park yesterday was no different . The hands- down winner , imported from Universal Studios where he will soon play the title role in the life story of Frank Merriwell , was Carlton Fisk . No contest at all . Details of Fisk ' s accomplishment , and his reaction to it are sprinkled liberally elsewhere on these pages . The loser , the goat in this baseball epic for our times , was Bob Stanley , who indeed could be located after the ball game was over sitting at his locker . He was not , however , contemplating his navel though it was plainly visible , proving that goats certainly do have them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air out of a can of what had once been Michelob Light as he described over and over to the scribes and pharisees the details of what had not been his finest moment in the major leagues . " I got ta go with my strong point - squeeze - and that ' s a sinker . His strong - squeeze - point is low and in . It wasn ' t a bad pitch . Walt Hriniak told me the pitch was - squeeze - six inches off the ground . But he went down - squeeze - and got it . A Fenway - squeeze - beauty . " Stanley had pitched to Fisk for the last four seasons , but he had never pitched to him , if you know what I mean . Carlton Catcher had always had a glove in his hand , not a bat , when he was 60 feet , six inches from Stanley Sinkerball . Stanley said it would make no sense to try anything except the sinker , the pitch that got him to the major leagues . " It would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he hit it out . " If my early-season perception indicator is working , what Stanley is saying is that if you don ' t want to end up second guessing yourself , you had better go with your best . Every hitter in the league knows the Red Sox reliever isn ' t going to mess around with sliders or changeup curve balls . They know what he will throw in a tough situation , the same as they knew that Sparky Lyle in his prime wouldthrow 20 sliders in a row . Knowing and hitting are two different matters , however , so Stanley ' s sinker has taken the Red Sox out of many jams in the last four seasons . He doesn ' t give up a lot of home runs - only 11 in 175 innings in 1980 . In 23 spring training innings , he hadn ' t given up one . " Next time , " he said , " maybe Pudge hits on top of the pitch and we get a simple ground ball out . " Yep , and next time maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ green , and instead of a triple bogey I ' ll get a birdie . We are dealing today , however , in " this time . " The first pitch Stanley threw to Fisk went bye-bye into the screen . The drive actually hit the top of the wall and then ricocheted off a light tower support and into the net . " I thought it would be a double , " said center fielder Rick Miller , the hero ' s brother-in-law , who hurried over to play the carom that never came . " We might have had a nice argument if it bounced off that support and came back down on the field . " Stanley was particularly distressed that Fisk was the one who had done the damage rather than . . . say . . . Chet Lemon or Ron LeFlore . " I just wish it wasn ' t Pudge , " he said . " That will make it bigger than it should be . " Why ? Wouldn ' t the box score still read " losing pitcher - Stanley " , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yeah , but it wouldn ' t rate the headlines it ' s gon na get now . " Stanley , who might have been excused if he ' d locked himself in a closet , faced his inquisitors with remarkable equanimity considering the somewhat embarrassing circumstances . The player the Red Sox most needed but weren ' t able to sign had come back to the scene of his greatest triumphs and taken Opening Day away from them . Not since the Grinch , otherwise known as Bucky Dent , stole Christmas , otherwise known as the 1978 playoff game , has there been such a heist at Fenway . And so Opening Day of the New Look , which had progressed so beautifully , with Ed Hoffman , the shortstop ' s father , singing The Anthem and Dennis Eckersley pitching so well and Dwight Evans and Gary Allenson hitting home runs , ended in a tangled heap on the locker room floor , alongside the crushed can of Michelob Light and Bob Stanley ' s sinkerball . You can ' t beat Hollywood .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
