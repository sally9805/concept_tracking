txt // regularly . Sometimes they coiled it into a knot on the top of the head . Women seemed to have enjoyed freedom and status in the society . Many of them were fond of fashions and luxuries as can be seen from the articles they used . They kept themselves beautiful by using a wide variety of toilet and cosmetic articles . Their toilet table contained bronze-mirrors , ivory combs of diffierent shapes , lipsticks ( Chanhu-daro finds ) , collyrium , face-paint , powder , hair-wash . They were familiar with different hair-styles . Along with cosmetic articles , the women of Indus adorned themselves with a wide variety of ornaments . Wealthy women wore ornaments of gold , silver , ivory , faience and precious stones . Their ornaments consisted of necklaces , girdles , fingerrings , nose-studs , ear-rings , bangles and anklets . The poor were happy with ornaments which were made of shell , bone , copper and terracotta . Ornaments , like necklaces , were made of different types of beads and they were in great demand . The wearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ male members of the family also wore them . The toilet articles of male members such as ivory combs and razors were also discovered . Even dressing tables with bronze mirrors were found . Amusement : A number of playthings such as a game-board with dice pieces , marbles , balls and other things belonging to the children like the toys were discovered at the sites . So one can say that a crude game of chess was probably the most popular form of pastime . We may also say that the children were not neglected as can be surmised from a number of playthings and toys of children . Other forms of pastime of the elders were the bull-fighting and hunting of wild animals . Rural economy : To feed the vast population residing in a number of cities , large-scale cultivation of foodgrains must have been undertaken . While the Indus population showed urban characteristics and bias , considerable size of rural population lived in the surrounding villages with agriculture as their main occupation . Besides , they kept livestock , raised poultry and looked after the dairy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ datepalm to the cities for sale . // Urban economy : In the cities like Mohenjodaro and Harappa several industries including the home-spun cloth developed . There were professional classes like the potters , carpenters , masons , jewellers , ivory-workers , goldsmiths , weavers , blacksmiths and dyers . Among these the potters no doubt take much credit for producing beautifully decorated pots . Most of the pots were wheel-turned . Polychrome pottery ( painted in several colours ) was also discovered at Amti , 70 miles south of Mohenjodaro . The potters also made big jars for storage of foodgrains and other things . Chanhu-daro must have also become a great centre of pottery and terracotta toys for children . The Indus craftsmen showed their great skill by producing beautiful copper and bronze vessels , household utensils , objects and ornaments , and bronze figurines . A little bronze figure of a dancing girl exhibits their remarkable craftsmanship . Indus craftsmen achieved remarkable success in lapidary work . They produced artistically made stone-beads , especially of agate and carnelian . Trade and Commerce : There is undoubtedly some evidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in trade and commerce . They used bullock-driven carts as a means of transport to carry goods from one city to another . Inland trade was flourishing . Besides , the Indus traders had developed commerce with many countries of West-Asia Crete and Egypt . There is a good deal of evidence to show that the Indus people maintained commercial relations with the Sumerians . Lothal must have served as the most important port of Indus people to carry on maritime trade . It had also a dockyard where ships were built for overseas trade . Some Indus seals were discovered in the ruined cities of Sumeria . Seals : In what connection seals were used for trade purpose is not yet known . The Indus seals are square in shape and made of steatite . More than 2000 seals have been found . They must have been used by the consignors to seal the packed goods before sending them to the proper destination . They might have been used by the customs authorities also . The carvings on the seals include human beings , divinities , animals , composite figures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scenes such as a man attacking a buffalo . // Religion : in the absence of any temple found as such , our ideas about their religion are mostly derived from the seals , stone-statuaries and some terracotta figurines . A large number of terracotta figurines of a female elaborately decorated with a crescent-shaped head-dress have been found in many Indus cities . So , it is assumed that these figurines represent the Mother Goddess . To substantiate further , another seal from Harappa contains a scene depicting a human sacrifice being offered to the Earth-Goddess . Many historians believe that the Shakti cult was then very popular , particularly during the pre-Aryan age . Numerous seals from Harappa and Mohenjodaro contain the representation of the male-God . The most common among them was that of.a God with three faces seated on a platform in a yogic pose with a trident and surrounded by a few animals . Scholars believe that he is the prototype of the later Indian Lord Shiva . Again , the discovery of many cylindrical and conical stone pieces which look like Shivalinga , has confirmed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have worshipped a number of semi-human and semi-bovine Gods . The worship of a number of mythical animals , snakes , and sacred trees like the pipal and /teem , was in vogue . The representation of Swastik and the Wheel also suggest the worship of the Sun God . The people offered animal sacrifices . The discovery of sacrificial altars of a square shape suggest offerings to Fire-God . Funereal customs : The disposal of their dead was done in three forms , namely , complete burial , fractional burial and post-cremation burial . The first involved the burial of the whole body with other articles such as pots and offerings in a pit . The second involved the burial of the bones and skull of the dead person , all placed in a big urn with other objects . The third refers to the collection of the ashes and bones of the dead and placing it in an urn along with other articles and burying it underneath the floor of a house . A few cemeteries were found in Harappa and Lothal . Defence Harappa , which lies on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fortification and a citadel . It appears that the city was well // forfied to prevent the invasions of foreigners . Mortimer Wheeler , after , seeing the granaries , barracks , and working platforms of Harappa , observed that they constitute " an example of cantonment-planning significantly within the shadow of the citadel " . A large number of weapons such as axes , spears , daggers . stone-maces , slings , swords , bows and arrows indicate that they were acquainted with the art of warfare . It should be noted that the weapons of war were made of copper and bronze . Looking at the kinds of weapons used and the metals of which they were made , it is observed that the Indus people were unwarlike in character . Secular Outlook : A noted archaeologist , S.R. Rao , is of the opinion that the Indus people " were pioneers in founding an empire even before the establishment of the Sargonid Empire in Mesopotamia , " and in all probability it was " administered by a benevolent ruler with a secular outlook . " Due credit should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of civic administration , town-planning , public sanitation , enforcement of regulation of trade , introduction of weights and measures and standardisation of all products suitable for international trade . Contributions Among the notable contributions they made were the Indus script , tolerance towards religious practices in their empire , their art and craft as seen on the seals , clay models and ornaments , and finally to the science of yoga . Decline of Indus Civilisation Much speculation has been made on the decline and fall of this great civilization . Of the many popular theories concerning this , one may accept that natural calamities such as widespread floods , shifting of the monsoons and soil-erosion as contributing factors for its decline . // Vyakarana ( grammar ) , Nirukta ( etymology ) , Chhandas ( metrics ) and Jyotisha ( astronomy ) . These six Vedangas are meant to help one in the proper understanding , recitation , and the j sacrificial use of the vedas . The second Vedanga deals with the ritual part of the study . if one desires to acquaint himself with this , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kalpa Sutras . The Kalpa Sutras are again classified into two categories ? the Srauta Sutras ( great rites performed by a number of priests ) and Grihya Sutras ( a house-holder 's domestic rites and sacrifices ) . The two other Sutra works are Dharma Sutras ( Customary Law and practice ) , and the Sulva Sutras ( rules laid down for constructing the Fire-altars ) . Kalpa sutras are of importance to us in " the correct understanding of the Vedic passages " . Area of Occupation As mentioned earlier , the early Aryans occupied the land of the seven rivers ( the Sapta-sindhu ) which extended from the Kabul valley in the north to the River Ravi in the south . The Rig Vedic people were tribal in character and each tribe occupied a particular region . Sometimes they fought among themselves . The Rig Veda mentions the Dasarajna , that is the battle of Ten Kings which resulted in the victory of the Bharatas who gave their name to this country . Political Organisation To begin with , the early Aryans were led by their tribal leader @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the tribal leader were obeyed by all . However , after their settlements in the Sapta-sindhu , they evolved monarchy as their form of government . The tribal leader came to be called as Rajan . Kingship became hereditary in the course of time . Thus the Saptha-sindhu area was divided into a number of small kingdoms , each ruled by a king . His main function was to lead the people in times of war ; and during peace-time he was to protect his subjects from the attack of his enemies . Other kingly duties included punishing the wicked and upholding of the Dharma . The Aryan king lived in a royal palace in the capital with all pomp and majesty and received taxes from his subjects . / // Next to the king in importance was the Purohita ( the Chaplain ) who invoked the blessing of Gods through his hymns to confer favours upon the king . The Rig Veda mentions great Purohitas like Visvamitra and Vasishtha and their great services to the state . Sometimes they acted as a check on the growing powers of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the subjects . The Senani was appointed by the king to be in charge of armed forces of the kingdom . He recruited able-bodied men and gave them training in the art of warfare . His other duties included providing the soldiers with necessary weapons and keeping the army alert and well-trained during peacetime . The Gramani was the leader of the village . He was entrusted with the task of collecting revenue of his village on behalf of the king . The village was generally looked after by him . Sabha and Samiti : The most popular representative bodies of the Rig Vedic age were the Sabha and the Samiti . A few lines in the Rig Veda indicate that the former was associated with men known for their wealth and position . When they assembled in a big hall they discussed not only social matters but also important political issues , if any . Collectively , the Sabha wielded great influence over the king and the administration . It might have also acted as a check on the arbitrary powers of the king . The Samiti was more political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ representatives of the common people and a few influential brahmans and heads of aristocratic families . It was in the samiti that the political affairs of the kingdom were freely discussed . The debates in the samiti must have been of a high order ; and the decisions arrived at by the king in his individual capacity must have been influenced by their wisdom . Other Forms of Government : Non-monarchical forms of government also existed among a few states . Oligarchy was in vogue in a few states where several members of the royal family exercised power jointly . References are also made in Rig Veda , to Jana ( republics ) where a Jyeshtha ( elder ) exercised his authority . The idea of one world government under an enlightened ruler was also not unknown to the early Aryans for the Rig Veda // mentions it in the phrase Visvasya bhuvanasya raja . So it was natural that the early Aryan rulers strived hard to rise from a position of tribal chieftaincy to that of the status of an emperor by a continuous process of expansionism through wars . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rulers . Vedic Society The main prop of the Vedic society was the family . A healthy family life based on love and affection among the family members was an important feature . Father was the head of the family and therefore commanded respect and obedience from the other members . All the members of the family or joint family lived in the same house made of wood and bamboos . Next to him in importance was the mother . Shc looked after the management of household affairs and helped her husband in performing religious ceremonies and sacrifices . Marriage was considered sacred and binding . The marriage tie bound husband and wife for life till death separated them . Children were educated . The education of girls was not neglected and is proved by the fact that Visvavara , Apala and Ghosha composed hymns and rose to the position of Rishis . It was the duty of the parents to get their daughters married when they attained the age of puberty . Girls and boys enjoyed the liberty of choosing their life-partners . Monogamy was common and polygamy was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No reference to polyandry is made . So also there is no reference to child-marriages . The birth of a son was always preferred to the birth of a daughter . A number of families bound by kinship and living in a village formed a clan . A number of clans living in an area constituted a district . A number of these districts formed the tribe . Beginnings of Class Distinctions : When the Aryans entered India and settled in the saptha-sindhu region , their varna ( colour ) and Sajatya ( kinship ) tightly knit them into a compact society . However , during the later Vedic period , nonAryans were taken into the fold of the society as free men . The class distinctions must have begun at the fag-end of the Rig Vedic period . The Purusha sukta appears in the tenth VEDIC 59 ' mandala ( chapter ) of the Rig Veda saying that the Brahmans , Kshatriyas , Vaisyas and Sudras appeared from the Purusha ( the primeval Creator ) through His mouth , from His arms , from the thighs and from His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the present caste-system seemed to have been present as inter-marriages , inter-dining and change of occupation were quite common . Untouchability was almost unknown . Then when did the caste system develop ? The answer to this question should be traced to the new environment the Aryans had to adjust to when their tribes migrated farther east . The genesis of the warrior class ( Kshatriyas ) was the result of systematic conquests undertaken by the Aryan rulers . They needed a permanent class of fighting men . Those who specialised in the Vedic studies and rituals constituted the priestly class ( Brahmans ) . Many others who settled down and engaged in the pursuit of agriculture and trade and commerce were known as Vaisyas . Many aborigines living in the villages as well as those who belonged to the wild tribes came to be known as Sudras . The caste system in its rigid form must have taken place when the Aryans conquered the Middle country ( Madhyadesa ) . Food and Drinks : Their food was mainly composed of animal flesh , vegetables , rice , barley , bean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flour . They liberally consumed milk and milk products such as ghee , butter and curds . They ate fruits . They were addicted to drinking of sura , a liquor made from barley and corn . Soma , a plant juice , was also a popular alcoholic drink which they even offered to the Gods . Dress and Ornaments : The dress ( vastra ) consisted mainly of vasas ( lower garment ) and the adhivasa ( an over-garment ) . The wearing of an under-garment ( nivi ) came into vogue during the later Vedic age . References are made to special type of garments , some embroidered , worn by dancers , brides and others . People living in the hermitages made good use of the skin of animals ( especially deer ) for making of garments . Names of several ornaments worn by men and women are mentioned in the Rig Veda . The Karnasobhana was an ornament attached to the ear and mostly worn by men . The : // brides wore Kurira , a kind of head ornament . Khadi was something like a ring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gold gracing the neck . There were other ornaments like the Mani and Rukma . Amusements : Some of their amusements included gambling , chariot-racing , dancing with females to tunes of dundubhi , playing dice and wrestling . Music was both vocal and instrumental . The Aryans were very fond of material pleasures of life and did not worry about disease or death . Standards of Morality : They maintained a high standard of morality . People lived in contentment and did not take to Vishnu // crimes such as stealing , robbery and murder . Morality among women was also very high . Economic Conditions Occupations : A large majority of the early Aryans were cattle-breeders . They loved pastoral life . They lived in villages . They owned land , houses , horses and cattle . They cultivated the lands and grew crops of wheat and barley . They considered the cow as a sacred animal ( aghnya ) . A man 's wealth was known by the size of his cattle . Industries : Weaving in cotton and wool flourished as an industry . Textile and woollen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were known . The services of a carpenter were found necessary for constructing houses , for household utensils and also household furniture . Carpenters supplied chariots , carts , boats , and ships . The village blacksmiths supplied articles made of iron such as sickles , razors and plough shares . They also produced weapons such as spears and swords . Professionals : Goldsmiths produced excellent ornaments in gold and catered to the fanciful rich . The leather workers supplied a number of articles such as shoes , bow-strings , reins water-casks , thongs and hand-guards . There were a number of other professionals like the butchers , potters , barbers , boatmen , moneylenders and hunters . There were physicians and priests whose services were found to be invaluable . // eruption of the volcanic island of Thera . Years later the Mycenaeans from the mainland conquered Crete and seized power from the Minoans . In all probability the Mycenaeans might have been Greek-speaking . About 2000 n.c. , the mainland of Greece was invaded by Achaeans , a branch of Indo-Europeans . Several migrations of this semi-barbaric tribesmen into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the mainland and some of them even occupied the islands nearby ( including Crete ) . About 1200 B.C. they attacked the city of Troy ? ea ten years siege and final destruction of this city are described by Homer in one of his epic poems , Iliad . Other Greek-speaking tribes who invaded the mainland of Greece include the Dorians , Ionians and Aetolians . The conquerors through inter-marriages with the locals became a mixed race . Geographic Influence The mainland of Greece is full of rugged mountains . Its // criss-cross ranges cut up the mainland into hundreds of valleys . The Greek tribes migrated into these valleys . A vast majority of people cultivated on the limited farms and the rest tended their herds . They imbibed much of the culture of the Minoans and built new cities in the place of the ruined ones . The geographical barriers came in the way of welding all the Greek tribes into a nation . Therefore , there developed a number of small Greek city-states . Scarcity of cultivable land in their country and nearness to the sea forced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ numerous colonies on the coast of the Mediterranean . They came into contact with the Phoenicians who supplied them with necessary goods . The early Greeks learnt Phoenician alphabet , and with necessary modifications adopted it for their script . Development of City-states : Geographical factors and the tribal character of the early Greeks were mainly responsible for or conducive to the growth of city-states . Each tribe occupied a valley which was separated from the other by mountains and rivers . In addition to this , tribal loyalty was strong enough to keep them separate . In such circumstances the unity of all the Greeks was hardly possible . Furthermore , each city-state guarded zealously its independent status and often was jealous of her neighbours . Each city-state with its countryside formed its own government with a king and a council . The most prominent among several city-states were Athens , Sparta , Corinth and Thebes . All these four city-states were comparatively larger in size and population than many others . Though the Greek city-states were jealous , independent and quarrelsome , all the Greeks strongly believed they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . Another bond which united them was the common language and literature . Every Greek citizen read Homer 's poems , Iliad and Odyssey , and considered these as a part of his heritage . One more factor which united all the Greeks was religion . Besides worshipping the patron-god or goddess , they worshipped common and popular gods like Zeus ( Sky-God ) , his son Apollo ( the Sun-God ) , Poseidon ( God of the sea ) Athena ( Goddess and protectress of cities ) etc . They believed that these gods and goddesses often played a considerable role WORLD HISTORY eir daily affairs and so treated them with great respect . All Greeks consulted the oracles to know about their future and often visited famous shrines such as the Shrine of Apollo at Delphi . Festivals were organised in honour of their gods to which all were welcomed to attend . Last but not least was the conducting of olympic games once in four years , held at OIympia in honour of the God Zeus . Participants from almost all the states came to compete in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were given garlands of sacred olive leaves . It was not prize-winning that mattered most but the spirit of excellence . Forms of Government To begin with , all the states had monarchy . Each monarch began to govern his city-state with the assistance of a council consisting of nobles . But due to several reasons monarchy did not remain as a popular form of government . There were changes and particularly with regard to Sparta and Athens . Sparta was probably the largest city-state . There were three classes in society , namely , peers , freemen , and helots . Only the peers got full citizenship and the rest remained without privileges . The helots were always revolting and , therefore , the peers received military training and kept themselves in readiness to suppress their revolts . Thus , Sparta turned into a military state . Her government was ruled by a few nobles . Two of these nobles became kings . So Sparta was led by two kings and other nobles . According to tradition , Sparta received her laws from a wise nobleman , Lycurgus . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ setting up of military states but also enabled them to keep the helots under subjection . Sparta did not make much progress in fields other than military training . Athenian Democracy : In contrast to Sparta , Athens registered remarkable progress in politics , laws , literature , art , science and philosophy . Athenians were fond of typing political experiments . Monarchy and oligarchy were not suited to their temperament , so they discarded them . Finally , democracy was ushered in . It was a product of the labours of three wise law-givers , viz .. Draco , Solon and Cleisthenes . The first step // towards democracy was taken by a wise nobleman , Draco ( 621 B.0 ) , who gave tyre Athenians a written code of laws . Although the laws were harsh , the citizens felt pleased for they at least knew positively what the laws were . They also felt safe from the tyranny of dishonest and corrupt judges . But Draco 's code did little to help the poor farmers who were at the mercy of rich nobles . Due to highly profitable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ landed-aristocrats . The poor farmers borrowed money from them during lean years with themselves or their children standing as security . When they could not repay they were turned into slaves . As the common people were on the verge of revolt , the nobles of Athens chose a liberal statesman , Solon , to prevent chaos . Solon 's laws or reforms liberated the enslaved farmers , made debt-slavery illegal , and cancelled all mortages on land . He helped Athenian merchants by introducing coin-currency and encouraged foreign artisans to settle in Athens . Henceforth an Athenian father had to " teach his son a trade by which he could support himself " . His other reforms included permission to all the citizens to take part in the Assembly ( lawmaking body ) , appointment of common citizens as jurors in courts , and a provision for appeal to a common man in common law-courts against the decisions of the aristocratic judges . Cleisthenes : But the lot of the common man remained worse because he was denied voting rights and public offices . Taking advantage of this situation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In spite of their reforms they became unpopular and had to leave . Cleisthenes , a member of the influential family of Alcmaeonidae , broke the power of the ruling clans belonging to the four old tribes by granting citizenship rights to male adults on the basis of residence in a particular locality . In other words , the power of the four old tribes was equally distributed among the newly organised ten tribes , and each tribe sending fifty members to the Council of Five Hundred . Thus . poor people also got the right to vote . Again , no member could continue in office for more than two terms and therefore a large number of citizens got the chance to work in the Council of Five Hundred ? a body which administered laws and controlled the magistrates . In this way the early Athenians came to have a democracy . Women and slaves could not exercise voting rights . // So , after a century of hard struggle , the common peo ple of Athens got a democratic government worth the name . The Persian Threat : Under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ empire whose border stretched from the Aegean seashore in the west to the border of Afghanistan in the east . Croesus , the world 's richest king of Lydia was defeated in 546 B.c. by the Persians under Cyrus thus paving the way for further expansion . The Greek cities of Asia Minor came under the rule of the Persian emperors . Revolt of Ionian Greeks : The Ionian Greeks of the cities of Asia Minor resented the loss of their freedom and so revolted against the Persian masters ( 499 n.c. ? 494 B . C. ) and sought assistance from the Greek cities on the mainland . Athens and a few other states sent aid . But the new Persian Emperor , Darius the Great , crushed these revolts and turned his attention to Greece . He desired to teach a lesson to Athens for sending help to his rebellious Greek subjects . // Persian Wars : The Persian emperor sent a large army ( which outnumbered the Athenian soldiers ) to attack Athens . The valiant Athenians engaged the Persians in a battle at Marathon ( 490 B.c. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flee . The Persians suffered heavy casualties ( 6400 dead ) while the Athenians lost 200 of their brave soldiers . Soon after the victory the joyous Athenian leader sent a runner to inform the people at home about the glorious victory . The runner covered the distance of 26 miles and 385 yards at a stretch , relayed the happy news and fell dead . In modern Olympics this sport item is included as the last event . Battle of Thermopylae and Others ( 480 B.C. ) : The Persian war did not end with the Marathon battle . Ten years later Xerxes , the successor of Darius , decided to avenge the Persian defeat . Himself assuming the lead he organised land and sea expeditions to bring about the defeat of the Greeks . He encouraged the Phoenicians to attack Greek colonies in Italy and Sicily . The Spartans realised the danger threatening their existence . Her king , Leonidas , with 300 brave soldiers held the narrow pass at Thermopylae for nearly three days till he was betrayed . They felt to the last man fighting heroically . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plains . They marched towards Athens and burnt the city . But the Athenians had their revenge soon when they defeated and destroyed the Persian fleet in the naval battle of Salamis ( 480 B.c . ) . The architect of this glorious victory was the shrewd Athenian statesman , Themistocles . The Persian Emperor suddenly made a hasty retreat to Asia Minor leaving his army on Greek soil . The Athenian fleet gained another victory over the Persians at Mycale on the Ionian sea-coast . The Persian army led by Mardonius suffered a humiliating defeat at Plataea ( 479 B.c. ) at the hands of the combined Athenian-Spartan forces . The Phoenicians attacking the Greek colonies also could not make much progress . Thus , Greek cities were saved due to the valour of the Greek soldiers . Her great statesmen gave a good lead which resulted in their victories . The Persian emperor gave up all hopes of conquering the Greek city-states . Even the Greek cities of Asia Minor gained freedom . By championing the cause of Greek freedom , Athens stood foremost among the Greek states . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Their success in the naval battles paved the way for prosperous sea-trade with the neighbouring countries . The Delean League was formed by many Greek city-states in alliance with Athens for self-protection . Athens was to achieve the climax of her glory during the time of Pericles ( 462-429 B.O. The Golden Age : Pericles was the great grandson of Cleisthenes . He led his soldiers to victory at the battles of Salamis and Mycale . Being a nobleman by birth he was taught by the best teachers of his time . The Athenians had so much trust and confidence in him that they elected him to the highest office ( Strategos ) for the next thirty consecutive years . It was he who completed the work of laying the foundation for democracy . Being a radical politician , he believed in reforms . He deprived the Arcopagus of its political powers and transferred the same to the Council of Five Hundred . This body suggested measures to the Assembly ( Ecclesia ) where it was freely discussed by all the citizens of Athens and passed into laws . Another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Every year about 5000 jurors were elected for a term of one year to act as judges . There were no lawyers or judges and so the plaintiff and the defendant had to argue their own cases before the jurors . The jurors decided the guilt and accordingly passed sentences . The Assembly consisting of all the Athenian citizens elected ten executive officers ( Strategos ) to command the army , navy and conduct foreign policy . Pericles was one among those ten , but he dominated the rest . Being a great lover of democracy he wanted even the poorest citizens to take interest in public affairs . For this purpose he introduced the system of payment of salary to the archons ( magistrates ) , members of the Council of Five Hundred , and the jurors in the state . Athens Rebuilt as the Most Beautiful City : During the Persian war , Athens had been destroyed . Pericles undertook the task of rebuilding the city . Hundreds of artists and architects worked to construct large public buildings . The most attractive feature of the new city was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most beautiful temple ever built out of coloured marble stones . Inside the // temple stood the tall marble statue of the patron Goddess of the city , Athena . Besides this marble statue , Phidias ( the most famous sculptor of his times ) , also made the statues of Goddess of Athena in ivory and gold . Ictinus , the famous architect of this temple , blended the three styles ? Doric , Ionian Corinthian ? to make this temple a wonder of the world . The Acropolis ( a small hill in the centre of the city of Athens ) with a collection of temples including the famous Parthenon became the main religious centre of Athens . Polygnotus was employed by Pericles to decorate the temples and buildings with his beautiful paintings . Pericles patronised music . No doubt the Athenians were rightly called the lovers of beauty and music . To protect his beautiful city from foreign invaders , Pericles got the " long walls " built which ran for nearly five miles connecting the city with the port , Piraeus . A big gymnasium was also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Athens was the market place , the Agora . Greek Philosophers The Age of Pericles was also the age of reason ' . Great Greek philosophers wanted to learn or seek true knowledge " about man and the universe " . They were not prepared to accept anything which did not withstand the test of reason . The greatest among them was Socrates ( 469-399 B.C. ) , an Athenian , who taught his pupils not to accept any principle or dogma without putting it to a severe test of reasoning . He tried to break down many prejudices of his pupils by his searching questions and discussions . The Athenian government considered his ideas about Greek religion as dangerous and corrupting the youth , found him guilty , and sentenced him to death . One of the pupils of Socrates was Plato who became a great philosopher ( 427-347 B.C. ) . His Dialogues contain the teachings of his master . Plato 's greatest work is the Republic where he describes an ideal state governed by a philosopher-king . Plato opened an academy to train students and one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as one of the world 's greatest philosophers . Education There were Sophists ( wise men or teachers ) who became very popular among the educated youths . They taught oratory , // mathematics , astronomy , grammar and literature . Military training was made compulsory in all the schools . Greek Literature The Periclean age was the golden age of Greek plays . The ancient Greeks loved to see the tragic plays of Aeschylus , Sophocles and Euripides enacted on the stage . The Athenian government awarded an annual prize to the best playwright after an open contest . Among the most successful were the three above named whose plays attracted all the citizens of Athens . Aristophanes was known for writing comic drama . The epic poems of Homer always inspired the Greeks . Knowledge of the past was popularised through myths , legends and folklores . But their authenticity was always questioned . Herodotus ( 484-425 rs.c. ) raised the status of history and is now regarded as " the father of History " . He is known for providing an interesting account of the Persian wars and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was Thucydides ( 471-400 m c. ) another Athenian , who gave the world the first scientific history . His most important work was on the Peloponesian war i.e. , the great war between Athens and Sparta . Other Types of Literature : Lyrical poetry set to music became a popular form of expression of love or sadness or gaiety . The first poetess who composed this type of lyrical poems ( odes ) was Sappho . Another great poet who produced this kind was Pindar . An important branch of Greek literature , if one may call it so , is the oratory i.e. , the art of making public speeches . The learned students were trained in this field . The most prominent orator of the Periclean age was Demosthenes whose famous speeches have earned him a niche in the temple of genius . Among the lighter type of literature , the Ancient Greeks produced , is the most popular Aesop 's fables . Science In the field of science , the Periclean age produced great men such as Hippocrates and Anaxagoras . Hippocrates ( 460-377 mc. ) laid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taught that diseases are of natural origin , " and not caused by evil spirits as many believed in those days . He became an inspiring figure to other physicians of his time . He prescribed // an oath binding fresh medical practitioners to follow an ethical code in their profession ( even now administered at the graduation ceremony ) . Anaxagoras ( 503-428 B.c. ) was a great philosopher and geometrician who taught in Athens . Democritus ( 460 B.C. ) set forth his theory of atoms . The Greek scientists made important contributions to the scientific knowledge for which the world is greatly indebted . Therefore , it is no surprise if historians have regarded Athens as the School of Hellas ' . Decline of the Greek-City States Athens which was the architect of the Delian League built an ernpire at the expense of the other members .

But they were not permitted to withdraw and were asked by Athens to continue to pay tributes to her . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another . Sparta became extremely jealous of the growing powers of Athens and so the war between them ? called the Pelopenesian war ? became inevitable . Sparta was helped by Persia who was always eager to divide the Greek city-states .

King Philip of Macedonia Taking advantage of the disunity of the Greek city-states , King Philip of Macedonia invaded it . With the exception of Sparta he conquered all the Greek city-states . He prepared a plan for a united Greece and to fight the common enemy ? the Persian empire . Before he could execute this plan he was assassinated . Alexander , the Great He was succeeded by his 20-year-old son , Alexander the Great , in 336 ii.c . Fortunately for Alexander , his father had left behind a highly disciplined and well-trained Greek army . He had been tutored by no less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father , loved Greek culture .

The house of the famous poet , Pindar , was spared by Alexander as he admired his great works . Alexander became the undisputed leader of Greece , and the Greeks got ready to fight the Persian Empire under his able leadership . At the head of a large Greek army of 35,000 soldiers , he marched against the Persian Empire and defeated the Persians in three successive battles at Granicus ( 334 B.C. ) , Issas ( 333 B.C. ) and Arabela 331 B.C. ) .

He set up his capital at Babylon in 324 B.c . Alexander 's successful march against Asia has remained without a parallel in world history . Unfortunately , Alexander died at the age of 33 ( 323 B.c. ) without bringing about a proper fusion of Greek and Asiatic cultures . Soon after his death there occurred a civil war among his competing generals to take control of his vast empire . After forty years , the civil war ended resulting in the division of his empire into three parts : ( 1 ) Egypt to remain with . Ptolemy , ( 2 ) Large part of Asiatic empire of Alexander to remain with Seleuens , and ( 3 ) Macedonia and Greece to he under the control of Antigonus .

He enabled the Greek culture to spread throughout the length and breadth of his empire by founding seventy cities . He and his soldiers married Persian women and worshipbed Persian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Asiatic countries and encouraged Greek immigrants to settle in Asiatic cities . From this happy union between the west and the east , there developed Greek-Oriental or Hellenistic culture . The main centre of this great culture was the city of Alexandria ( Egypt ) . It also became a great commercial centre . Here the Ptolemies ( Greco-Egyptian rulers ) set up a // world famous museum and library for scholars to visit . The library had a rich collection of 700,000 volumes of Papyrus scrolls embodying knowledge in all fields . The Ptolemies also built an observatory to help the astronomers to make important discoveries . Greek Language : The Greek language became extremely popular in the entire eastern Mediterranean world . All the rulers of these countries popularised the Greek language among their subjects . Businessmen , students and merchants all learnt this language and improved their prospects . Greek literature came to be appreciated very much by scholars and students . Scribes made copies of old Greek literature . Scientific Discoveries and Inventions : The Hellenistic civilisation which flourished for nearly three centuries produced great scientists who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Euclid of Alexandria , expounded his theorems of geometry so well that they are studied even now . Geography became a subject of study and geographers made maps of the countries . One of the most famous geographers was Eratosthenes who accurately measured the circumference of the earth which was said to be 25,000 miles ( his small mistake being a difference of 200 miles ) without any scientific aid or instrument . He also produced maps with longitudes and latitudes . Archimedes of Syracuse is well known to us for discovering the principle of specific gravity . He discovered it while taking bath and was so overjoyed that he ran naked into the streets crying Eureka , Eureka ' ( I have found it , found it ) .

Among the beautiful statues , the most famous was Venus de Milo . Philosophers : The contact between the west and the east brought about new philosophies . There were philosophers known as cynics who urged people to hate politics , power and wealth . The most famous among them was Diogenes . There were others who came to be called as stoics who urged people to have patience , fortitude and courage and accept misfortunes as natural . The leader among the stoics was Zeno .

Architecture and Engineering . Science . Religion . Philosophy . Conclusion . PART I While the ancient Greeks gave the world their idea of democracy , art , philosophy , science and literature , their natural successors , the Romans , added to it their legal system and the art of statecraft . Again , while the Greeks always remained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and consolidation . The Greeks tended to be intellectual but the Romans . proved to be practical minded . With these contrasts in mind , let us examine the genesis and development of the Roman Empire . Geographical Factors Like Ancient Greece , the early history of Rome in Italy was profoundly influenced by geographical factors . The mountains in the north ( the Alps ) and the seas surrounding all the three sides have given Italy its natural protection . However , it did not prevent hordes of tribes from entering Italy through the passes . The Apennine mountains run north-south along the eastern coast and hence made it possible for Rome ( lying at the centre of the west coast ) to dominate over the entire peninsula eventually . Mild climate and fertile soil proved to be congenial for the growth of agriculture . As Italy with Rome // faced west rather than east , she was able to gain control over the western Mediterranean world . Latins and Others About 1800 B.c. a group of Indo-Europeans called Italics came to Italy through Alpine passes . One of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the central plains of Italy lying south of the River Tiber . They spoke Latin and learned to use bronze . The Latins began to live in small walled villages for protection . They established several such villages in the midst of seven hills near the west coast overlooking the River Tiber . They became trading posts of the Latins and eventually developed into the city of Rome . The Latins were not the only people who settled in Italy . There came the Etruscans , a civilised people from Asia Minor , who settled on the land lying north of the River Tiber around S00 B.C. In the far south of Italy the Greeks had established their colonies . They occupied the eastern part of Sicily also . In the farther north there were the barbaric Gauls . Etruscan Rule Overthrown The Latins came under the civilised Etruscan rule for nearly two centuries . From the Etruscans the simple Latins learnt many things like constructing stone-buildings , building arches , draining marshes and using sewage system , predicting future and fighting-formations in war . The Etruscans were eventually driven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was established . The Roman Republic was aristocratic in character because only the aristocratic calss called the Patricians enjoyed political , social and economic privileges . Two magistrates known as Consuls chosen every year from the rank of Patricians ( nobles ) became heads of the Roman government . The Consuls and other officials like the Praetors ( administrators of Justice ) , Aecliles ( controllers of city government ) , Quaestors ( accountants ) and censors ( who supervised the list of citizens and their morals ) were all chosen for one year by the Assembly consisting or weapon-bearing men . But the most important political body was the Senate having about 300 Patricians . In times of emergency , a dictator was chosen by the Senate for a term of // six months . The common people were known as Plebeians who. were denied powers and privileges by the ruling politicians . They launched a long historic struggle and finally won some major concessions . Those major concessions for the Plebeians included ( 1 ) the right to elect tribunes or officials who had the power to veto legislation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right to inter-marry with the members of Patrician family , ( ? ) right to hold public offices , ( 4 ) Laws of Rome in the form of Twelve Tables ( all in writing ) as a guarantee of protection against whimsical Patrician judges , and ( 5 ) the Assembly or Comilla to have power to make laws which could not be vetoed by the Senate . The fusion between the two classes  --  the Patricians and the Pleheians ? made the Roman Republic truly democratic in character . Expansion of Rome Rome rose as a small city ? legends say it was founded by the twin brothers , Romulus and Remus on the Palatine hill in 753 B.c. ? and destiny ordained ' her to become a big empire after a few centuries . In her early imperial career , she faced formidable enemies such as the Aequians from the east , the Etruscans. from the north and the Volscians from the south . Fortunately , . all the Latins got united and formed a political league under the leadership of Rome and the attacks of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by one to the invading Romans . Then the Gauls , a war-like people from the north , attacked the city of Rome itself and burnt it . The Romans were forced to pay a huge ransom to save themselves . The members of the Latin league broke the union and attacked Rome . So , she had to crush these rebellions . The San-mites , a war-like tribe inhabiting the highlands of the central Apennines , caused serious troubles to Rome and so she had to wage three wars to crush their power . The result was that she became supreme over central Italy . During the last quarter of the third century B.C. she had to face formidable Greeks of the south who sought help from Pyrrhus , king of Epirus . Initially suffering setbacks in the war with the Greeks , the Romans , however , succeeded in conquering the south also . Thus , Rome ( 270 B.C. ) became the mistress of Italy . // Rome 's Clash with Carthage : But her troubles were not yet over . A fierce and far more powerful and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Carthage lying on the north African coast just opposite Sicily grew as one of the most powerful and wealthy Phoenician colonies . Her powerful fleet dominated over the western Mediterranean and her armies gained control over northern Africa , Spain , western part of Sicily , Sardinia and Corsica . She grew terribly afraid of the expansion of Rome and attempted to prevent her from trading with Sicily . The wars between those two great rivals broke out in 264 B.C. when Carthage occupied Messina , a port in north-eastern Sicily . As the first Punic war was mostly fought on the sea , Rome suffered a series of defeats at the hands of the Carthagians . However , learning from experience , the Romans started building better battle-ships to fight the enemy . The war ended after 23 years ( 241 B.c. ) with Carthage suing for peace and ceding the island of Sicily . After another 23 years ( 218 B.C. ) , the second Punic war began when Hannibal , a famous Carthagian general , attacked Saguntum ( east coast of Spain ) , an ally of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elephants , Hannibal marched from Spain to Italy through Gaul ( France ) and the Alps and scored three brilliant victories against the Romans . Unfortunately , he could not capture Rome because he had not brought siege machinery . He avenged the first defeat of Carthage by roaming about in Italy from one end to the other proclaiming himself to be her master . But Hannibal did not get cooperation from the Italian cities and his forces and supplies began to dwindle during 13 years of his stay . The Romans appointed Fabius Maximus as dictator to deal with Hannibal . He adopted delaying tactics to wear out his enemy 's patience and also by not engaging in an open fight ( hence his title or nickame as Cunctator ' ) . The Rornans also foiled the attempt of Hannibal 's brother to go to the rescue of his brother . Finally they sent a brilliant commander , Publius Scipio , who won a victory against the Carthagians in Spain . From there he proceeded and attacked Carthage ( 202 B c. ) itself . Hannibal had to return home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ battle of Zama . Carthage sued for peace and // paid a heavy penalty . She lost Spain , paid heavy war indemnity , and agreed not to wage any war against Rome . Despite these setbacks Carthage recovered her former glory in about half a century . It must be remembered that Hannibal who fled east secured the alliance of powers like Macedonia , Greece and western Asia Minor to fight Rome . But he did not succeed as all these three powers were defeated one by one and conquered by Rome . Carthage Destroyed ( 146 B.C. ) Rome had suffered so much at Hannibal 's hands that a section of Romans led by Cato desired nothing short of destruction of Carthage itself . They cried Delenda est Carthago ( Carthage must be destroyed ) . While Carthage was busy grappling with her troublesome neighbours , Romans attacked her . Despite her stout resistance she was defeated and the invading Romans took vicarious pleasure in destroying this most beautiful city . Her citizens were either killed or sold into slavery . She became a Roman province . Thus , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merchants became prosperous . She came into contact with the Hellenistic culture which was much superior to hers . This brought about a marvellous transformation in her own civilisation as later events were to prove . Macedonia and Greece became Roman provinces after the suppression of their revolts by the Romans in 146 n.c . Rise of Dictatorship in Rome : The extremes of wealth and poverty resulted in growing class conflicts and sometimes led to civil wars in Rome . The People 's Party was formed to make the Roman government to favour the poor by passing necessary land-laws . In the meanwhile the Roman Generals began to raise mercenary armies to promote their own selfish interests . Thus , the Roman Republic lost much of its original vigour and vitality and finally paved the way for the dictatorship of Julius Caesar . Julius Caesar Among the Roman Generals who became famous ( as the first triumvirate ) were Pompey , Julius Caesar and Crassus . Pompey was known for the conquest of Syria and the Near-East and controlled the Roman Senate . Julius Caesar conquered Gaul ( modern France @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Rome about his great victories . Crassus died fighting the Parthians . The victories of Julius Caesar made Pompey not only feel jealous but nervous and so he was ordered to return to Rome minus his army . But Julius Caesar with his loyal army crossed the River Rubicon in 49 B.c. and marched towards Rome ? a most fateful step he took in his life . Being extremely popular with the Romans , Caesar made a triumphant entry into Rome while Pompey and the Senate members fled . But Caesar chased Pompey right upto Egypt where he was killed . Egypt under Queen Cleopatra became an ally of Rome . Although he ruled the Roman Empire like a virtual dictator , Julius Caesar showed respect to the Republican traditions and form of government . After putting down the revolts in Spain and Africa , he inaugurated his rule with a series of reforms . His reforms included improvement in agriculture , reduction of taxes , removal of corrupt and oppressive governors , granting of citizenship rights to the people of Gaul and Sicily , distribution of public lands , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ introducing the Julian Calendar . He had many plans such as to bring about a legal code and construction of a library but unfortunately he did not live to complete them . A few of his enemies led by Brutus ( who felt quite jealous of Caesar 's popularity with the masses ) assassinated him on the Ides of March , 44 B.C. This incident plunged Rome into a civil war . Octavian , a grand-nephew of Julius Caesar , and Mark Antony joined to crush those who murdered Caesar . They were joined by Lepidus , a great politician of Rome , to form a second Triumvirate . They defeated Brutus and Cassius , who were the chief conspirators , at the battle of Philippi in 42 BO . Brutus and Cassius took their own lives and the Roman empire was divided into three parts  --  - the eastern provinces including Egypt came under Mark Antony and the Western provinces were ruled by Octavian . Sicily and Africa came under Lepidus . Unfortunately , Mark Antony fell madly in love with the Egyptian Queen Cleopatra and neglected state affairs . Augustus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ army to defeat Antony . Antony was defeated in the naval battle of Actium . He committed suicide . Queen Cleopatra also committed suicide by taking the poison of an asp . After her death , // the rule of Ptolemies ended and Egypt became a Roman province . Octavian ( 29 u.c. - 14 A.D. ) , in an earlier encounter , had brought about the defeat of Lepidus . So he ruled the Roman Empire as the undisputed master with such titles as Augustus ' and Princeps ' ? the former denoting his divine status . Outwardly showing his regard for the Republican form of government , Augustus wielded unlimited powers to complete the task left by his uncle . Golden age ' of Augustus marked by Reforms : The Augustan age is sometimes described as the golden age ' in the history of Rome . It was known for peace and prosperity . This was ensured by Augustus since he introduced several administrative and economic reforms . Honest and sincere governors and other officials were appointed in the provinces to improve conditions . They were all paid by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their respective provinces and also maintained records regarding the wealth of the citizens . The latter was carried out in order to bring about a fair distribution of taxes . The emperor kept the poor people happy by supplying foodgrains free during difficult times and provided for their free entertainment . They were encouraged to worship him as god . He undertook public works schemes to bring about the employment of the poor . Augustus spent money lavishly on such public works like construction of public buildings , roads , bridges , amphitheatres and fountains . The most prominent among them were the Coliseum , the large amphitheatre ( which accommodated 50,000 people ) , and the Baths of Caracalla . Construction of highways from the provincial cities to the capital served a dual purpose , i.e. , facilitating trade and commerce on the one hand and exercising political control on the other . There is no doubt in the saying , " all roads lead to Rome " . Rome became the nerve centre of all trade and commerce in the Mediterranean world . Rome rose as a small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after a few centuries became the world capital . It is no surprise that Augustus could say with pride that he found Rome a city of bricks and turned it into a city of marble . The Roman empire under Augustus maintained diplomatic and commercial contacts with a number of countries including // China and India . He encouraged art and literature . Livy , a Roman historian , wrote the Annals ( History of Rome ) . Virgil wrote an epic poem , Aeneid . Other famous writers who enriched the Latin literature with their important contributions were Ovid , Horace , Pliny , Juvenal and Tacitus . Augustus takes the credit for establishing Pax Romana ( Roman peace ) which lasted for nearly five centuries . Birth of Jesus ( 4 B.C. ) : One of the most important events which took place in his glorious reign was the birth of Jesus Christ ( 4 Inc. ) , in Bethlehem , near Jerusalem . Rome extended the citizenship rights to her provincial subjects . Successors of Augustus The successor of Augustus was his son Tiberius who proclaimed himself as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end and the empire witnessed the rule of one man . In its long and chequered history the Roman Empire was alternately ruled by good and bad emperors . The bad emperors included Caligula and Nero . The latter murdered many including his own wife and mother . He blamed the Christians for setting fire to Rome . In the long list of good emperors we have Marcus Aurelius , a great Stoic philosopher who wrote Meditations . With his death ended the Age of the Antonies . The general decline of the Roman empire commenced after the death of Marcus Aurelius . It was to some extent checked by Diocletian and Constantine . The former divided the empire into two parts , the East with its capital at Byzantium and the west with Rome . Constantine brought about the unity between the two under his control after defeating his counterpart . He shifted the capital of the empire from Rome to Byzantium which was renamed after him as Constantinople . After his death the two halves got totally separated with each coming under an emperor . Fall of Rome : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fall of the Roman Empire . Among the most important are the following : ( 1 ) constant invasions of barbaric hordes like the Germanic tribes and the Huns , ( 2 ) a succession of weak and incompetent emperors , // ( 3 ) wide gulf between the rich and the poor and the latter bearing the main brunt of many taxes , ( 4 ) slavery , and ( 5 ) lack of leadership and discipline in the Roman army . PART II THE LEGACY OF ROME Let us examine what the Romans have bequeathed by way of legacy to world civilisation . It is no exaggeration to say that were it not for the Romans the Greek culture would not have spread to the western world . Directly or indirectly the Romans acted as agents to spread and preserve much of what the ancient Greeks had left behind as their legacy . It was from the Greeks that the Romans imbibed ideas on religion , philosophy , art and architecture , learning and science . But it is also untrue to say that the Romans copied everything from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fields such as organisation of central and provincial governments , laws , principles of taxation , citizenship rights , hospital and sanitation systems and the construction of public works like the fountains , theatres , baths , bridges , aqueducts and arterial roads . Pax Romana ( Roman Peace ) The Romans were great builders of an empire whose borders touched all the peripheral countries of the Mediterranean Sea ( Britain and Mesopotamia to be included ) . After having achieved this they organised the local and provincial governments in such a way as to ensure peace and harmony among the local populace . This they did by not interfering with the local religions and traditions of the conquered lands . However , to ensure a lasting loyalty to their emperors , the Romans granted citizenship rights to provincial subjects thereby granting them a status of equality with the Romans . Border provinces were protected from the invading hordes by constructing a wall and stationing of Roman legions . Able governors were sent to maintain law and order , a fair system of // taxation and administer justice . Piracy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any fear . A uniform system of currency came into vogue to facilitate trade , commerce and banking . In course of time all the provinces sent their representatives to the Assembly . Roman Law : The most lasting contribution of the Romans was made in the field of law . It is no exaggeration to say that their laws had made profound impact on almost all the civilised nations of the world today . The first written code came in the form of Twelve Tables in 150 B.C. which were inscribed on the twelve tables of bronze and publicly displayed in the forum ( market place ) . Subsequent growth of the Roman Empire and of her commerce made it necessary to enlarge the scope of the Twelve Tables taking into consideration such changes as the rights of foreigners living in the Roman empire . The Roman Government appointed a special judge , Praetor Peregrines , to look into the matters relating to the rights of foreigners living in Rome . Taking the customs and traditions as practised by foreigners into consideration , a new body of laws came to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in succession . This body of law came to be known as jus gentium . Again , in other fields , the rulings of the judges and decisions of the ? magistrates remained as unwritten laws . The Roman laws came to be completely classified and codified only after a lapse of several centuries . The great Eastern Roman Emperor , Justinian caption // ( 527-565 A.D. ) undertook this enormous task and quite succeeded in completing the code named after him ? the Justinian Code . As the Roman law proved to be just and humane in character , it was adopted by many civilised nations . To mention a few salient features , the Roman law gave an opportunity to the accused to defend his case . Unless his guilt was proved beyond any reasonable doubt ' in a court of law he was not punished . Another salutary principle that they adopted was that all citizens , however high or low they may be , were equal before law . Architecture and Engineering : The Romans excelled all others in the construction of public buildings . They copied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but arches and domes were their inventions . Their Pantheon ( temple ) at Rome has a dome measuring 142 feet in diameter . The Coliseum ( stadium ) which was completed around A.D. 80 accommodated about 50,000 persons who assembled there to enjoy gladiatorial fights or the slaying of the Christians by the hungry lions . Roman emperors built forums , baths , bridges , aqueducts , fountains and 12,000 miles of highways on 372 main routes . The aristocratic Romans were fond of luxurious life . They built beautiful country mansions and decorated them with good furniture , marble statues , attractive paintings and expensive tapestries . They laid out gardens surrounding their mansions and had goldfish ponds . Learning , and Latin Literature : The Romans were fond of learning . The Greek slaves taught Roman children during the early period . But after some time these teachers were replaced by the Romans themselves . Rhetoric , grammar and logic were taught . At advanced centres of learning , subjects like astronomy , mathematics , and medicine were included . These were studied by the children of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In literature , the Romans tried to imitate the Greeks . It was during the time of Augustus that Latin literature reached its highest watermark . Before the Augustan age , there were the writings of Julius Caesar ( Gallic Wars and the Civil War ) and Cicero . With the dawn of the Augustan age there began an outpouring from Virgil , Horace , Livy Sallust and Ovid . During the // next few centuries , the Latin literature was enriched by the writings of Tacitus ( a famous historian ) , Javenal ( a satirist ) , Plutarch ( another famous historian ) , Seneca ( a playwright of tragedies ) , Marcus Aurelius and a host of others . Science : The Romans maintained personal cleanliness , and for this purpose they built baths . All their towns and cities could boast of good drainage system . They built hospitals where patients were treated by qualified physicians and given medicines . The greatest physician of the Roman empire was a Greek by the name Galen . He wrote more than 530 works on human anatomy and physiology wherein @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body . The science of surgery also made considerable advance . Operations were conducted , if it was found absolutely essential . Pliny the Elder wrote the Naturalis Historic ( Natural History ) , a large " compendium of all known science . " Strabo was a great historian and geographer who gave a good account of the uses of materials . Ptolemy ( see Greek history ) wrote Almagest , a gist of astronomical account of his age . The Julian calendar was prepared by Sosigenes , an astronomer of Alexandria , who calculated the base year as 365.25 days ( hence a leap year once in 4 years ) . It was introduced in 45 B.C. by Julius Caesar . The Romans borrowed the notation system from the Etruscans . Religion : The ancient Romans worshipped gods and spirits at home . They did not build temples . The head of the family offered simple ceremonies to family gods and spirits . Influenced by the Greeks later they started having prototypes of Greek gods in different names . God Jupiter was the Sky God whom the Romans considered as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became the God of War . Ceres became popular with farmers for this deity gave good crops . Venus became the goddess of love . Neptune was the sea-god . The Romans observed two important festivals , Lupercalia ( February 15th ) and Saturnalia ( December 17th ) with all gaiety . Then there was the festival to honour the great mother of the Gods , Cybele . Mithraism also prevailed . Thus mysticism persisted in the Roman Empire . The Roman Emperors like Augustus and Diocletian encouraged people to worship them like gods . With the teachings of Jesus Christ , Christianity-spread among the poor and the helpless . // Philosophy Although Rome could not produce anything original in the realm of philosophy , she had great thinkers who subscribed to either Stoicism or Epicureanism . The former was found to be better " fitted for the Roman temperament " . Lucretius advocated Epicureanism . Among the Stoic philosophers , the most prominent were Panaetius of Rhodes , Seneca of Rome and Emperor Marcus Aurelius . The last wrote Meditations in which he has interpreted " stoic philosophy and its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ played a dynamic part in building a vast empire and within its territories lived people belonging to different races and speaking different languages . Their greatness lay in welding these " listless subjects into a powerful nation . " They enriched the world culture with their art , architecture and literature . Their greatest gift to mankind was the Roman law which took final shape under Emperor Justinian as corpus juris civilis . It served as a model to many civilised nations . It should also be remembered that it was in the Roman empire that Christianity grew into a great religion . Part Three : Major Religions in India // Hinduism not only represents a religion followed by a majority of people in India but a way of life . The religion is so universal in outlook as to embrace all divergent ideas , attitudes and opinions that it may be called a super-religion . With its . encompassing thoughts and universal ideas about God , it has not yielded to the proselytising ideas and doctrines of other religions brought by the numerous invaders and has successfully survived many inroads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Ramanuja , Madhwa and so on . Almost all scholars have admitted that it is the oldest religion in the world . Derivation of the name Hindu Many are familiar with the fact that the earliest invaders of India were the ancient Persians . They called all those living on the other side of the river Indus ( Sindhu ) as Hindu obviously for the reason they could not pronounce sa . Instead they used ha . This name was in vogue for a long time . With the advent of Islam in India , the non-Islamic population went by the name Hin dus . Founders of this religion It is surprising to note that Hinduism does not owe its existence to any prophet or a personal God or for that matter to any particular sacred book like other religions . Its knowledge , rid , came to be discovered bit by bit by the famous Rishis ' 94 WORLD HISTORY ( Seers of thought ) from time to time . In other words , its knowledge had remained eternal and the Rishis ( whose names occur in the Vedas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from time to time through discoveries . They were handed down from generation to generation through the chanting of the hymns till it was finally written in vedic-Sanskrit . The Vedic Literature The vedic literature gave a definite shape to Hindu religion . The word veda ' is derived from the word vid ' ( which means to know ) . The vedic literature is composed of four vedas , the Brahmanas , the Aranyakas , and the Upanishads . The Rigveda is the oldest and probably written when the early Aryans settled in the Sapta Sinclhu region . Although the Vedas are divided into four for the convenience of performing sacrifices to propitiate gods , it is better to know that they are divided into two parts : the karma kanda that which relates to work-portion and jnana kanda , the knowledge portion . The Vedic Religion The karma kanda refers to ceremonials , performance of sacrifices , rituals and other things , but these days most of them have been given up as impracticable . The karma kanda also refers to day-today performance of duties by professionals , householders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of life ( what is known as Ashrama Dharmas ) . These duties are practised even to this day though not in the strictly prescribed manner . From Hindu religion and view of life what is most important is the jnana kanda which imparts " the essence of the knowledge of the vedas " and which goes by the name Vedanta . The essence of the knowledge of the vedas ( i.e. vedanta ) is contained in the Upanishads ( of the vedas which are fourteen in number ) which deals with spiritual and scientific enquiries in order to reveal the secrets of life , purpose of life , the nature of the universe and about the eternal Creator . Hinduism may be having hundreds of sects , but at least in one thing they all agree . All recognise the Upanishads as final authority and therefore the principles of the Vedanta based on Upanishads are permanent or // unchangeable . The symbols of Upanishads have been used by Hindus in their forms of worship or to convey great philosophical ideas . What is conspicuous in the Upanishads is the idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To use the Sanskrit couplet it is Ekam sadipra Bahuda vadanthi ( " That which exists is One : sages call It by various names " ) . We see the drift from polytheism to monotheism . Although the Rigveda mentions the name of Viswakarma as the Creator of all things and beings in the Universe , nowhere else has it been more affirmed than in the Upanishads . It is the greatest truth or tenet of Hindu religion which is more or less ignored by the westerners . The next in importance to the Upanishads are the Smritis which was again composed by the great Rishis . The Smritis came to be composed from time to time relating to the ethical and social laws which govern Hindu manners , customs , traditions , dress , habits and so on . The famous Manusmirti was composed by Manu who prescribed a code of conduct for individuals and householders and prescribed inheritance rights of men and women and so on . As society undergoes transformation from one period to another , the social laws too underwent some changes in keeping with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If there are any variations in the version of the vedanta and smritis , the former is followed . The Puranas come next . They popularise the Vedic religion of the Aryans through story-telling . As the Vedic religion or Hinduism was understood more easily only by the educated , it was found necessary that it reaches the masses . Therefore , Puranas came to be written ? eighteen in number ? to carry home the message of Hindu religion to the common people of India . Besides being historical , the epics like Ramayana and Mahabharata have found a perennial place in the hearts and minds of all Hindus . They impart great values which are imbibed by one and all . A kind of robust optimism it teaches Hindus by saying that every individual should aim at purusarathas and they are Dharma prescribed to achieve these ends one by one . A boy is initiated // into Brahmacharya ( bachelordom ) should gain knowledge . When he gets married he becomes a householder and therefore should strive to attain wealth and enjoyment . The ranaprastha and sanyasa come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worldly life and find ways of attaining Moksha ( salvation ) . In the Mahabharata , the Gitopadesha constitutes the crux of Hindu religion in which Lord Krishna himself becomes the preacher . He gives an idea to Arjuna , what God means and is , through his Viswa swaroopa and tells how all things and living beings were created and destroyed by Him and how they serve His purpose . He makes it clear to Arjuna on the battlefield that he was being used as an instrument to destroy wickedness in the world . He talks about Atnian and Faramatnran . Lord Krishna discusses about theory of karma and means of salvation . Hindu Philosophy Why is God partial ? Why are some born rich ? Some poor ? Some in health and happiness and others in misery ? All these questions are answered in Hinduism . It is not God Who is responsible for this . It is a person 's karma ( good or bad action ) in the previous birth . In other words , the soul is eternal and goes through birth death and rebirth in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this life , probably in the next , due to punya ( credit ) your life becomes comfortable and enjoyable . if you act wickedly now , in the next janma ( birth ) you will suffer . Buddhism and Jainism borrowed this theory of Karma from Hinduism . Means of Salvation Births and deaths can not be avoided for they are not in our hands . So what an individual can do is strive for salvation . Our bodies and minds may perish but not atma ( Self ) . This individual-self should be liberated from the bondage of the cycles of births and deaths and ultimately merge with Brahman ( God ) . What are the methods through which salvation could be attained ? How can one free oneself from samsara ( attachment to worldly-life ) ? To a Hindu , there are three or four ways by means of which he could attain salvation and they are by practising either ( 1 ) // Jnanayoga ( self-knowledge ) , or ( 2 ) Karmayoga ( performance of actions ) , or ( 3 ) Bhakti yoga ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( path of concentration ) . These pathways emphasize only dominant aspects but not exclusive by themselves . It is the seeker who should choose his path towards salvation . For example , at the highest plane , Jnana coincides with Bhakti and leads to karma or virtuous life or actions ( i.e. service ) . The Bhakti-marga or yoga has become popular because it is easy to practise . Dr. Radhakrishnan says that " sinners as well as saints , ignorant as well as learned ' foolish as well as wise find it easy " . Prayer , petition , fasting , sacrifice , communion and self examination are all included in as elements in the 73haktiyoga . Hindu religion does not keep its windows shut to new ideas and it always experiments with truth . That is why we find various sects , opinions , philosophies , etc. , existing side by side in full harmony . The Tantric forms of worship crept into Hinduism so deeply that for some time the common people found it unable to practise for they not only became meaningless but expensive . Therefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Buddhism , to cater to the spiritual needs of the common people . In conclusion one can say that Hinduism embodied in itself different kinds of religious experiences and by recognising the different approaches to realise the Almighty God it survived many a crisis and emerged as the most successful religion in the world . // Early life of the Buddha .

Gautama the Buddha and Vardhamana Mahavira both belonged to the Kshatriya clan and they led the revolt . Early Life of the Buddha Before attaining enlightenment the Buddha was known as Siddhartha . He was born in the year 566 B.C. at Lumbini near Kapilavastu . He belonged to the Sakya clan and his parents were Raja Shuddhodhan and Mayadevi . Mayadevi died soon after child-birth and Siddhartha was looked after by his aunt and step-mother Prajapati Gautami . Several legends ( the Jataka stories ) have been woven round the childhood life of Siddhartha . Raja Shuddhodhan consulted court astrologers to predict the future life of his son and they prophesied the greatness of his son in the realm of thought . Worried // about his son 's monkish predilections , Raj Shuddhodhan got his son married to Yasodhara at the age of sixteen .

After the birth of his son , Rahula , he began to feel uneasy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had great impact on his life . It led to his great renunciation during the 29th year of his life . Great Renunciation : During the next six years of his life , Siddhartha led the life of a wandering ascetic and received instructions from two teachers called Alara and Udraka . When the teachers could not satisfy his curiosity regarding life and its purpose , he left them and reached Uruvela ( near Gaya ) . It was there that he practised most severe penances . His thirst for truth remained unquenched and he was reduced to a skeleton . After taking bath in the river Nairanjana , he gave up fasting . He reached Gaya where he sat under a pipal tree in deep meditation . At last his meditation was rewarded with the attainment of supreme knowledge and insight , He was called the Buddha ( The Enlightened One ) . He spent the rest of his life in preaching his doctrine . He died at the age of eighty at Kusinagara . Teachings of the Buddha : The Buddha delivered his first sermon at the Deer Park @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dharmachakra Parivartana ( the turning of the wheel of Dharma ) . His followers included the five ascetics who had parted his company earlier . Ile taught his followers to recognise the four " Noble Truths " ( Arya Satya ) . The first truth is the existence of sorrow ( Dukkha ) . The second truth relates to the main cause of sorrow , i.e. , desire ( Trishna ) . The third refers to the elimination of sorrow . The fourth truth reveals how sorrow or sufferings can be eliminated by following the eight-fold path . Ashtanga-Margo : It is through the practice of Ashtanga Marga one can attain salvation or eternal bliss . The noble eight-fold path includes ( 1 ) Right Views ( 2 ) Right Intention ( 3 ) Right Speech ( 4 ) Right Action ( 5 ) Right Living ( 6 ) Right Effort ( 7 ) Right Mindfulness , and ( 8 ) Right Concentration . The Buddha believed in the Hindu doctrines of Karma and rebirth .

Buddhist ( Sangha ) order of monks established : The Buddha rejected the principles of the Vedas and condemned the performance of bloody sacrifices . He denied the existence of God and asked his followers to lead a life of simplicity and purity . He established the Buddhist Sangha where his disciples received instructions and led a life of simplicity and morality . He did not make caste or class distinction before taking them into the fold of the Buddhist Sangha . During the early stages of Buddhism he did not allow women to join the Sangha but a little later they were also permitted . An organisation for the Buddhist nuns was also founded . Spread of Buddhism Several factors led to the popularity of Buddhism in northern India . The Buddha was known for his magnetic personality . He explained the doctrines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoken by the people . He made his teachings popular by narrating them in the form of parables . He kept the doors of ' his religion open to all , irrespective of caste or class . Prince and pauper vied with each other to embrace this Middle Path . There were no priests , no rituals to be observed and no costly sacrifices to be performed . Even a house-holder could practise the eight-fold path and attain salvation . Finally , the Sangha founded by the Buddha propagated the tenets of the Master after his passing away . But the most important factor for the popularity of Buddhism lay in the royal patronage it received . Buddhism enlisted the support of great rulers of early times Iike Bimbisara , Ajatasatru , Emperor Ashoka , Kanishka and Harshavardhana . Emperor Ashoka not only embraced Buddhism but made the religion popular throughout the world by sending his emissaries . He held the third Buddhist Council ( The first two were held within a century after the death of the Buddha at Rajagriha and Vaishali ) at Pataliputra under the leadership of Mogaliputta @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compilation of Buddhist scriptures . Emperor Kanishka convened the fourth Buddhist Council at Kuddalavana ( in Kashmir ) which prepared commentaries ( Upadesa and Vibhasha Sastras ) on the sacred Scriptures . The Sacred Text came to be known as Pali which is divided into three Pitakas or baskets . They are the Sutta Pitaka , the Vinaya Pitaka , and the Abhidharnma Pitaka . Rise of Mahayana Buddhism : The schism developed most probably during the time of Emperor Kanishka . A marked deviation from the practices of the old religion occurred . The simple and revered teacher or the Buddha came to be worshipped as a God . His images were made and prayers were offered to them . The images of the Buddha and the Bodhisattvas adorned the walls of the Viharas and Chaityas . Sculptors of the Gandhara School of Art made statues of the Buddha . The Jataka stories formed the theme of many of the carvings on the Rock-cut halls and caves .

The Buddha , like Christ , enjoined upon his followers to return good for evil , truth for a lie and non-enmity for enmity . It advocated restraint and urged its followers to overcome greed and anger . Mercy and kindness for men and animals found a place of honour in the realm of Buddhist thought . Buddhism laid emphasis on the principle of Ahimsa ( non-injury ) . Its teachings had profound influence on great personalities like Emperor Ashoka and Mahatma Gandhi . Buddhism broke the barriers of caste and class and promoted feelings of social and national unity . It paved the way for political unity of the country under the Mauryan Emperors .

By far the greatest contribution of Buddhism to Indian culture lay in the development of art and architecture . A large number of ruined monasteries stand today to point out the glory of Indian art and architecture . The Buddhist monks introduced rock-cut architecture . They built their Viharas by hewing the rocks . Their artists and architects did splendid work by building the Chaityas . Carvings of the Buddha are found on the Chaitya Halls at Karle . The Stupas of Sanchi and Bharhut exhibit their excellent carvings .

The sixth century B.C. is considered as one of the important epochs in the history of India for the reason that it gave birth to two great religions ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turmoil since the Hindu religion had lost its pristine glory and simplicity and degenerated into an amorphous cult . The priestly class ? the Brahmanas ? arrogated to itself a position of pre-eminence and interpreted the sacred lore only to the few . Performance of sacrifices and meaningless rituals were given more prominence than finding a path to attain salvation . A layman lost his sense of devotion and attachment to God due to such services rendered by the Brahmanas . In these circumstances , many felt disgusted and took to an ascetic way of life as advocated in the sacred scriptures like the Aranyakas and the Upanishads . There was also a terrible reaction to Brahmanical Hinduism especially coming from the Kshatriyas . In the meanwhile a few religious orders were founded by the wandering ascetics or hermits . These wandering ascetics were known as Shrarnanas or Parivrajakas . Then came the Samkhya school founded by Kapila . He did not believe in the existence of God and his philosophy wielded considerable influence on Mahavira and the Buddha . The new religious orders did not gain much popularity and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which gained immense popularity . They were Jainism and Buddhism . Both were founded by men who belonged to the Kshatriya class . // They led the revolt against the imposition of Brahminical religion by the priestly class and also against the perpetuation of the caste system . Parsvanatha ( 8th century B.C. ) Jaina tradition says that its religion is as old as the human race . It also claims to have produced 24 Tirthankaras ( saints ) . The first twenty Tirthankaras ( Rishaba being the first ) appear to be legendary characters . However , the last two , namely , Parsvanatha and Mahavira , are historical figures . Parsvanatha seems to have lived 250 years before the birth of Mahavira . He was the son of king Asvasena of Benares . He became an ascetic at the age of 30 and the sect he founded gathered a large number of followers called Nigranthas . Parsvanatha insisted on his followers the practice of four great virtues . They are ( a ) Satya ( Truth ) , ( b ) Ahimsa ( non-injury to life ) , ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( d ) Asteya ( nonstealing ) . Early life of Vardhamana Mahavira Vardhamana Mahavira was the 24th and the last Tirthankara according to Jaina traditions . He was born around 540 n.c. in Kundagrama , a suburb of Vaishali ( the capital of Videha ) . His parents were Siddharatha and Trishala . Trishala was the sister of Chetaka , a prominent Lichhavi prince of the time who ruled the Vajji confederation . Being noble by birth , Vardhamana was brought up in the midst of luxury . He married Yasoda and subse- I " quently a daughter was born . She was named Anojja or Priyadarsana. // Soon after the death of his old parents , Vardhamana took the consent of his brother to renounce the worldly life . He left home in his 32nd year and became a monk . He discarded his clothes ( Digambara ) and spent the next twelve years of his life in meditation and self-inflicted tortures with the object of achieving perfect knowledge ( keval-jnana ) . At the end of this period he succeeded in becoming a keualin ( omniscient ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Mahavira . Vardhamana Mahavira spent the rest of his life in preaching his doctrines to the people of Magadha , Anga , Mithila and Kosala . His religion attracted a large number of followers , and among them were kings , powerful nobles , wealthy merchants and house-holders . He lived till his 72nd year and passed away at Pawa , near Patna . Mahavira was a contemporary of the Buddha but they never met . The teaching of Mahavira : The followers of Mahavira were called Nigranthas . Even today many of them consider him not as a founder of a new religion but as a great reformer . Mahavira began his preaching career to reform the sect founded by his predecessor Parsvanatha . Besides the four vows prescribed by Parsvanatha for his followers , Mahavira added the fifth , i.e. , the observance of Brahmacharya ( chastity ) . One of the main facets of Jainism is the belief in soul and Karma . Mahavira declared that every element is a combination of material and spiritual factors . The former perishes but the latter does not . An @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To liberate the soul from the bondage of karma , it is necessary to destroy the latter . This can be achieved by an individual by practising the five vows , namely , Satya , Ahimsa , Aparigraha , Asteya and Brahmacharya . In addition to observing the above five vows , a true Jain should also follow the three-fold path ( called Ratnatraya ) to attain " the pure and blissful abode ( Siddha Sila ) . " They are the Right Belief , Right Knowledge , and the Right Conduct . By Right Belief he meant belief in Jainism , and by Right Knowledge the liberation of soul . The Right Conduct implied the strict observance of the five vows in the day-to-day life of an individual . The doctrine of non-injury is also one of the important tenets of Jainism . Mahavira emphasised that not only human beings , birds and beasts have souls but also plants . // metals , water and wood . Therefore an individual should avoid harming these things . An individual should conquer his senses and lead a life of austerity and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ created by God or make any reference to Him . Change is a natural phenomenon . Birth and death are natural and applicable to men and matter . Mahavira also rejected the Vedic principles as unimportant and condemned the sacrificial rituals performed by the brahmanas . He believed in the freedom of women and allowed them to join his order as Sravikas . Religious Literature : The teachings of Mahavira are contained in the fourteen old texts called as Purvas . Towards the end of the 4th century B.c. a great famine broke out in Bihar which led to thousands of Jainas heading towards Mysore led by Bhadrabahu . Those Jainas who stayed behind convened a council to compile the Jaina texts . They are twelve in number and called Angels . About the sixth century A.D. another council was held in Valabhi to bring about the final collection of all Jaina scriptures and put it in writing . They were written in Prakrit language . Svetambara and Digambara Jains : When Bhadrabahu returned to the north with his followers he found his co religionists clad in white ( Svetambaras ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adhered to the old rule and remained nude ( Digambaras ) . The Digambaras refused to acknowledge the canon drafted during their absence and adhered to the principles enunciated in the 14 Purvas . The schism in the Jaina religion might have occurred some time during the first century A.D. Spread of Jainism Several classes of Angadharas spread the teachings of Mahavira after his death . As earlier mentioned , Jainism got the royal patronage and counts great kings like Chandragupta Maurya , Bimbisara and Samprati as its chief patrons . After the decline of the Mauryan Empire Jainism spread to the western and southern parts of India . Jaina monasteries were built during the rule of Sakas , Ksatraps , and Rajputs in western and northern India . King Kharavela of Kalinga was a great patron of Jainism . The Satavahanas , the Gangas , Chalukyas , // Rashrakutas and Hoysalas who ruled the south also patronised Jainism . Its Contributions The impact of Jainism on Indian culture was profound and worthy of mention . It propounded a new philosophy called " Syatvad " which aimed at achieving the welfare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which he lives on the other . Although the principle of Ahimsa was known to Hinduism , it was Jainism which brought about its universal acceptance . The idea that plants have life in them was proved beyond doubt in the early years of the present century . Jainism rendered great service to humanity by not recognising the caste system and established the principle of equality . Even women were considered as an important section and their freedom was advocated by no less a person than Mahavira . The Jaina religion gave stimulus to vernacular literatures . The early Jaina literature was in Prakrit . Mahavira had preached his doctrines in the language called Ardhamagadhi , a language known to many people in his days . It was in this language that the 12 angas came to be written . But the unique contribution of Jainism to literature was giving birth to the Apabhramsa language . Jaina works produced during subsequent centuries were in all vernacular languages including Sanskrit . Some of the most prominent scholars who produced Jaina literature were Hemachandra , Hari Bhadra , Sidha Sena , Nagachandra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and under its influence many Jaina works came to be written . Jainism welded profound influence on Indian art and architecture . The followers of Jainism built Jaina temples , monasteries and hospitals . The most popular Jaina temple at Mount Abu was constructed by Kumarapala , a king who was served by the most noted Jaina author , Hemachandra . Jaina stupas , statues , and carved pillars still exist in Mathura , Gwalior , Chitor , Abu and other places . At Udaigiri and Ellora one sees the cave-temples with beautiful sculpture and architecture . One should not forget the Hathigumpa caves ( in Orissa ) and the colossal statue of Gomateswar in Sravanabelagola. // Life of Jesus . His Crucifixion ( 30 A.D. ) . Teachings of Jesus .

He talked about the kingdom of God where there would be justice , love and kindness . He collected a band of followers . As he was preaching to the people of the village , he conveyed his messages in the form of parables . True to his teachings he led a very simple life and mixed freely with the poor .

Unfortunately , the Romans believed that his growing popularity was a cause of public disturbances . Jesus knowingly courted arrest for he knew the time had come to put his creed to the test . He celebrated his last supper with his disciples ? including Judas Iscariot ? the night before his death . When . Jesus was praying in the Garden of Gethsemane , the temple guard arrested him . It was Judas , who betrayed the identity of his master by kissing him on his cheek and thereby giving hint to the guard who Jesus was .

His followers called themselves Christians ( Greek word Charistos means anointed ) . The followers of Jesus established Christianity based mainly upon his teachings . // Teachings of Jesus : While the Old Testament in the Bible contains everything about Judaism , the New Testament includes the life and teachings of Jesus . Jesus taught that God is the creator of the universe and mankind . He is all merciful and kind to one and all . He further said that men should live like brothers and be devoted to God . Sinners should repent and beg God 's mercy . Men should develop noble character by doing good deeds . Jesus insisted that people should do good to even those who did bad things to them .

It runs as follows : " Blessed are the poor in spirit ; for theirs is the kingdom of heaven . Blessed are they that mourn ; for they shall be comforted . Blessed are the meek ; for they shall inherit the earth . Blessed are they who do hunger and thirst after righteousness ; for they shall be filled .

The Arabs became nomadic ( nick-named as Bedouins ) . They tended camels and used them to carry merchandise from Syria and other upcountry lands to the southern ports and back . They were used to a hard life and so quarrels between one tribe and another were the order of the day . Robbing caravans , plundering cities and bloody wars were all so common because of the absence of a strong central government .

His birth was considered auspicious by many because a terrible pestilence which was ravaging Arabia suddenly ended . As Mohammed lost his parents early in his childhood , he was looked after by his grand-father and later by his uncle , Abu Talib . Due to poverty he could not receive any formal education but he was trained to look after sheep and camels .

Occasionally , he would visit Mount Hira , near Mecca , for meditation and fasting . Many a time he fell into a trance ( ecstatic fits ) and uttered words which came to be recorded by his early disciples . Later they constituted a part of the Koran . It was not until his fortieth year , that Mohammed realised the full impact of the divine messages which he received from God . He also realised that he was the chosen one and therefore had a great mission to fulfil . Mohammed was convinced that he had a great role to play in spreading the message of Almighty God Allah among his fellowmen . He declared " there is no God but Allah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gathered a number of disciples , the earliest among them were his wife , his son-in-law , and his friend , Abu Bekr . He started preaching the principles of his new faith to the people of Mecca but their general attitude seemed hostile . The priests of the Temple of Kaaba were alarmed and they opposed the teachings of Mohammed . His life was in danger and therefore he had to retreat to Medina in 622 A.D. This retreat to Medina constituted a most important year for Islam and it was called Hejira 621-22 ( reckoning of a new year in the Muslim calendar ) . Birth of Islam It was in Medina that Mohammed could get a warm reception to his new faith . He gathered a large number of disciples . Mohammed 's fame and that of his new faith began to spread rapidly all over Arabia . In 630 A.D. , he captured Mecca whose citizens embraced his faith . Thus Mohammed sowed the seed of a new religion called Islam ( meaning peace with God ) in Arabia , and in course of time it became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ died in 632 A.D. At the time // of his death Arabia was practically united under his able leadership and his followers ( Mohammedans ) having a great zeal to spread their new faith . Teachings of Mohammed the Prophet : The new faith which Mohammed preached was called Islam which simply means submission to God Allah ' and the gist of this new religion is found in the sacred book called Koran or Quran ( in Arabic meaning recitation ) . Islam includes religious belief of the Mohammedans , their daily duties , and the virtues to be practised . Mohammed preached that there is one God and that is Allah and Mohammed is his Prophet . God reveals his desires to mankind through his prophets and Mohammed declared that he was the last prophet . He condemned idol worship . He asked his followers to totally submit themselves to the Almighty and all merciful God Allah without whose blessings no one can enter paradise after one 's death . Those who do not believe in Him would suffer in hell . All those who believe in Him and obey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the eyes of God . Mohammed preached that every true believer in Islam has certain duties ( ibadat ) to perform in his life . First , he should profess his faith in God Allah and his messenger , Mohammed , by reciting la Ilah ilia Allah , Muhammad rased Allah ( i.e. , there is no God but Allah , and Muhammad is His Prophet ) . This recital of the creed is called Kalma . Secondly , he should perform the Salat or recite prayers five times in a day ( dawn , mid-day , mid-afternoon , sunset , bed-time ) . Every true believer should go to the mosque to offer his prayer and listen to the discussion of the Koran . Thirdly , every Mohammedan should fast ( from sunrise to sunset ) during the lunar month of Ramzan . Fourthly , all believers in Islam should give alms to the poor . The practice of this virtue is known as Zagqat . Finally , a true Moslem should undertake a pilgrimage to the holy city of Mecca at least once in his life time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followers to practise many other virtues like humility , charity and honesty . Respect for women and parents , kindness to slaves and animals , and avoiding gambling and drinking were also prescribed by the // Prophet . The Koran also contains rules and regulations on such matters like marriage , divorce and inheritance . For those who faithfully follow the teachings of Mohammed the Prophet , God Allah would reward them a place in heaven after their earthly existence . On the day of Judgement God Allah would punish the sinners , evil-doers and infidels by sending them to hell . Thus Islam combined in itself some of the best democratic principles such as equality of man , universal brotherhood and direct communion between God and man . It is no wonder that it became one of the world 's great religions in the course of time . Spread of Islam : Mohammed did not leave any heir or nominate any successor . Therefore , the chiefs of Arabia chose the Prophet 's friend , Abu Bekr ( 632-34 ) , to succeed him . He became the first Caliph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Muslim theocratic State ) . During his very short term of rule Islam spread to the neighbouring country , Syria . The next Caliph was Omar ( 634-44 ) who was mainly responsible for building a large Islamic Empire . His famous general Khalid brought about the defeat of the Roman Emperor Heraciius and received from him provinces like Damascus , Syria , Palestine and Phoenicia . After that Egypt was conquered . The Islamic empire began to spread towards the east with the conquest of Mesopotamia and Persia . During the next hundred years , the Arabs conquered North Africa and Spain . In the east they conquered Sindh ( 712 A.D. ) . They attempted to capture Constantinople twice ( 673 and 717 A.D. ) but failed . The Arabs crossed the Pyrenees and entered France but they were defeated by Charles Martel in the bloody battle at Tours in 732 A.D. However , the Arabs continued to hold Spain for the next seven centuries . The people coming under Arab subjugation were given the choice of either embracing Islam or pay tribute or be condemned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after defeating the Byzantine fleets during the early ninth century . They succeeded in conquering Sicily and the southern part of Italy . In due course , Islam spread to eastern Africa , Malaya , Indonesia , some parts of Western China and India . Muslim traders and missionaries also contributed much to the spread of Islam in many countries of Africa and Asia . // Caliphs Othman and Ali : After the murder of Omar , Othman succeeded as the new Caliph and ruled the Islamic Empire for nearly 12 years . During his time , the real power was exercised by his cousin Muawiyah who belonged to the Omayyad tribe . There was a civil strife which finally led to the assassination of Caliph Othman . Othman was succeeded by Ali who had married the prophet 's daughter , Fatima . Ali 's serious rival was Muawiyah , governor of Syria and cousin of Othman , who staged a revolt . A series of battles ensued between the two which finally ended in the murder of Ali . Before Ali 's sons could assert themselves , Muawiyah declared himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a treaty , acknowledged the claim of Hussain ( son of Ali ) to the Caliphate after his death . Un fortunately , things did not happen the way they should have . After Muawiyah 's death , his son Yezid succeeded to the Caliphate . Quite enraged at this turn of events Hussain left Medina for Kufah to meet his followers . On his way he was murdered with his two hundred followers at Karbala . Sunnis and Shias : Disputed succession and civil strife thus became endemic . It divided the Muslims into two sects ? the Sunnis and the Shias . The Sunnis maintain that Abu Bekr and his two successors were the legitimate successors of Mohammed the Prophet . The Sunnis strictly conform to the Surma ( custom , usage and form ) regarding all matters and look to the Koran for direction . However when the Koran " does not fully and clearly provide direction , the inquirer should seek trustworthy information as to what Mohammed had said on the subject , what his action had been with relation to the subject or what he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opinion that Abu Belo and his two successors were usurpers . They maintain that All was the legitimate successor . The Shias also observe the martyrdom ' of Hussain ( son of Ali ) at Karbala during the first ten days of Muharrarn . The Omayyads and the Abbcsids : After the murder of All , the Omayyad Caliphate began with the succession of Muawiyah who transferred the capital of the Arab empire to Damascus . It was during the time of his son Yezid that the killing of Hussain and his followers took place at Karbala . One of the // great achievements of Omayyads was the conquest of Spain following the landing of their famous General Tarik on a rock now bearing his name ( Jabal-al-Tarik meaning the mountain of Tarik ' or Gibraltar ) . The Omayyad dynasty remained in power till 750 A.D. and subsequently it was overthrown by Abbasids ( descendants of the Prophet 's uncle , Abba ) . They shifted the capital from Damascus to Baghdad . They followed a ruthless policy of eliminating the Omayyad princes till none survived except Abdur Rahman . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cordova in 755 A.D. The most celebrated ruler among the Abbasids was Caliph Haroun-AlRaschid who figures prominently in The Thousand and One Nights . His son Mamun also became a distinguished ruler of the Abbasid dynasty . Mamun 's death was followed by the rise of independent Muslim states . At the end of the tenth century the Arab empire got split into three caliphates ? ( 1 ) the Abbasids of Baghdad , ( 2 ) the Fatimid of Cairo , and ( 3 ) the Omayyad of Cordova . PART II LEGACY OF ISLAM Enlightened Autocracy Like the Roman Empire which was known for its vast size and variety of peoples , the Arab or Islamic Empire included in its fold subjects living in Spain , North Africa , the Middle East and South Asia . The Moslems produced enlightened rulers who did not experience any difficulty in bringing peoples under their subjugation . The most distinguished Moslem rulers of the time were Haroun-Al-Raschid and his son Mamun . The Caliphs of the time wielded both spiritual and temporal powers and the people considered them as the true representatives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard to propagate the new faith but tried to bring about equality and universal brotherhood among Mohammedans . Mohammedans cherish the memory of the glorious reign of Caliph Haroun-Al-Raschid because he was just , wise and humane . He created opportunities for the poor and the downtrodden to live // in solace and comfort . Furthermore , he encouraged learning , art , literature , science , trade and commerce . Learning The Islamic Empire built by the Arabs could boast of great centres of learning . Baghdad , Cairo , Damascus , Cordova , Seville and Barcelona all became centres of advanced learning with the establishment of universities . The Arab scholars in Baghdad translated all the ancient Greek classics and also the Hindu books on mathematics . Learning came to be patronised by enlightened rulers in the form of awarding scholarships to meritorious students and maintaining libraries with vast source materials . The meritorious students took full advantage of the patronage and produced great works . Literature and History : The contributions of Arabs to literature was prolific . They produced the Koran which is ranked as one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of biographies and histories , the most famous being the Annals of the Apostles and the Kings written by Al Tabari . Their most entertaining work , if one may call it so , is the Thousand and One Nights or the Arabian Nights which has remained ever green and ever popular . It has now been translated into many languages . In poetry , Omar Khayyam 's Rubaiyat ( in Persian ) found its place of honour . Saadi composed mythical and philosophical odes known as Gulistan and Bustan . In writings on Epics , Al Firdausi became quite famous with his Shahnama ( Book of Kings ) which was dedicated to Sultan Mohammed Ghazni . Another Scholar-Historian , Ibn Khaldun , wrote his masterpiece Muquaddimah where he outlined the philosophy of history . The most outstanding philosophers of the age were Avicenna ( 980-1037 ) and lbn Rushid or Averrhoes ( 1126-1198 ) . The former was a genius who wrote a hundred treatises in different fields of knowledge and his singular contribution to the science of medicine was his work , Canon of Medicine ( an encyclopaedia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physicians consulted this standard reference work . In Arab-Spain Averroes wrote commentaries on the works of Aristotle which were translated into Latin by // European scholars . His followers , called Averroists , became radical thinkers . Medicine- Rhazes ( 865-925 ) : The Arabs contributed much to the progress of the science of medicine . The first to distinguish himself in this field was Rhazes ( 865-925 ) who wrote Al Hawi , a comprehensive work on the practice of medicine . After Avicenna , Al Hasan of Basra distinguished himself with an original work on Optics ( which was later translated into Latin as Opt/ate Thesaurus ) which influenced many western physicians . Thus , Arab scholars in medicine raised the status of the science of medieval quackery . Exact Sciences : In exact sciences like mathematics and astronomy the Arabs learnt much from the Hindus . They replaced the Roman numerals with their own which originated in India . The Europeans learnt from the Arabs ( who were much indebted to India ) the mathematical terms like zero , cipher and algebraic equations . They made improvements in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principle of pendulum in physics . Arab Geographers worked hard to make their subject rise to the status of science . Accurate measurements to draw the longitude and latitude were made with the help of other sciences like physics and mathematics . Their Manufactures : They learnt the art of manufacturing paper and block-printing from China and introduced them to Europe . They discovered many chemicals and knew the technique of preparing alcohol , sulphuric and nitric acids . The art of dyeing clothes was known to them . The work of Muslim craftsmen particularly in handicrafts , came to be very much appreciated . Persian carpets and leather-works became world-famous . Their textiles like muslin , gauze and damask attained great fame . They also produced beautifully decorated weapons such as daggers , swords and knives . Travel and Trade : The Arabs proved to be habitual travellers . They undertook long voyages by land and sea and made notes on what they had seen and heard . Some of the most famous travellers of the period were Alberuni ( a famous astronomer , physician , historian and geographer all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Ibn Hakaul and a host of others . Their travels were followed by extensive trade with . countries such as India , China and the coastal countries of Africa . They bought a large amount of spices from the east , diamonds from Golconda , pearls from Ceylon and musks from Tibet . They sold their specialities such as fine rugs and carpets , Baghdad perfumes , muslin , gauze , mohair , damask and fruit-syrups . It is no wonder that Baghdad became a great city and capital known for its fabulous wealth . In a way the Arabs may be called " the Phoenicians of the Middle Ages " since they carried on a brisk intercontinental:trade . Art and Architecture : Like the Romans the Arabs became great builders . Most of their cities were adorned with great palaces , tombs , mosques and other structures . Under royal patronage beautiful buildings came up such as the Al Hambra palace at Granada ( in Spain ) , Alcazar at Seville and the Great Mosque of Baghdad . Their style of architecture included in its fold the dome , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the representation of human beings and animals , the Muslim artists decorated the outer as well as the inner walls of the palaces and mosques with intricate carvings and designs . Mosques and palaces were surrounded by beautiful gardens and fountains . The Arabs astounded the western world with their outstanding achievements . It was through them that Europe came to know of the treasures of Greek classics and absorbed the knowledge of the civilised orient . Part Four : Life in the Middle Ages // Middle Ages defined .

Hanseatic League . Political role of the cities . The Rise of the new middle class in towns and cities . Guilds and Crafts . Crafts Guilds . Medieval Universities. ? Learning in the Middle Ages . Early universities of Europe . Student 's life . The Middle Ages Defined The term Middle Ages in the history of Europe refers to the period which lie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of America . This is said roughly to cover a span of one thousand years . The early part of the Middle Ages is often termed as " the Dark Age " because we do n't have much knowledge about life and conditions during that time . The Renaissance scholars of Europe like Petrarch also considered it so because the people of that age disregarded the study of Greek and Roman classics . However , for that reason , a student should not ignore this period as one of an uncivilised age . The Middle Ages roughly begin from the eleventh century A.D. Therefore one should remember that the early Middle Age might not have been progressive on account of the chaos created by the invasions of barbaric hordes on Europe . But the later Middle Age witnessed a definite advance towards culture . The Early Middle Age : During the early Middle Age , Germanic tribes occupied western provinces of the Roman Empire . The Anglo-Saxons conquered England . The Franks occupied Gaul . The Visgoths settled in Spain and the Ostrogoths held Italy . It was during this time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serving as centres of learning . Christianity offered hope to those // troubled humanity from death and destruction . While much of western Europe lay at the feet of barbaric hordes , the : Eastern Roman Empire managed to flourish . It was subsequently known as the Byzantine empire on account of its Greek . influence . It was during the eighth century that Europe came to have a feudal society . Her trade and commerce had declined , and her cities lost their importance . For a time the Merovingian and Carolingian dynasties tried to unify western Europe . Charlamagne built what later came to be called the Holy Roman Empire . It was during the seventh century that Islam was founded by Mohammed the Prophet . Islam united all the Arabs and further paved the way for their cultural advancement . The Mohammendans embarked upon a career of conquest with a zeal to spread Islam . They succeeded in conquering countries , of Asia Minor , northern Africa and Spain . They would have conquered Europe but for the decisive defeat they suffered in the bloody battle at Tours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Martel . The Later Middle Age : Between 1000 and 1300 A.D. Europe witnessed agricultural prosperity , growth of towns and universities , strong monarchies and the supremacy of the Papal authority . It must be remembered that the Holy Roman Emperors tried to establish their supremacy in Christendom but failed and at the same time Papal authority reigned supreme because of the Crusades . The investiture contest between the emperor and the Pope reached a new height during the reign of Henry VI . It led to his deposition and excommunication by Pope Gregory VII . Henry IV had to go to Canossa and wait for three days in humiliation to receive papal pardon . Between 1300 and 1500 A.D. Europe witnessed famous wars like the Hundred Years ' War and Ottoman invasions , . , . famines and plague ( the Black Death ) , and the decline of the Papacy . With the development of towns and cities in Europe the shackles of feudalism over the serfs began to break . A new entrepreneurial class emerged . A few intellectuals began to challenge the doctrines and practices of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Middle Ages in Europe . Papacy The Roman Catholic Church became really universal with hundreds of churches being set up all over Europe . The // bishops assisted by a number of priests served the spiritual needs of the community . In course of time the bishop of Rome claimed to be the leader of Christendom . It may be noted that St. Peter was the first bishop of Rome who was " entrusted with the keys of heaven . " With the fall of Rome due to the invasions of the barbarians , the Church began to play the role of super-government in western Europe . This became evident when medieval Papacy was founded by Pope Gregory the Great ( 540-604 A.D. ) in 590 A.D. He was elected as the Pope when Rome was being attacked by Lombards , and the law and order situation there had become bad . Using his position and office , he restored law and order in Rome and showed his ability in matters of administration and diplomacy . He founded the Papal authority over temporal affairs and sent missionaries to Britain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reached great heights from the accession of Pope Gregory VII in 1073 A.D. , to the early fourteenth century . Church vs. the State . The Church increased its authority under the Popes in manifold ways . It performed all the ceremonies , kept records , set up its own courts , and tried and punished heretics . It opened schools , libraries and even settled disputes over legal matters . Naturally its encroachment over state matters caused great concern to the monarchs or emperors . The Pope became the central figure in the dispute over the appointment of bishops and other church officials . This is known as the investiture conflict . Pope Gregory VII prohibited the appointment of bishops by kings and emperors and claimed himself to be the supreme arbiter over temporal and moral disputes . The Holy Roman Emperor Henry IV became angry and announced the deposition of Pope Gregory . Pope Gregory retaliated by declaring that Henry IV was no longer the Emperor and excommunicated him . This rift ended in the humiliation of Emperor Henry IV . When he went to Canossa to seek the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three days in the cold outside his castle . After receiving the pardon , the Emperor regained his power and position . Then he turned his wrath on the Pope and made him flee from Rome . King John ( 1199-1216 A.D. ) of England was compelled to seek // pardon and submit himself as vassal to the most powerful Pope Innocent III ( 1198-1216 A.D. ) . It is no exaggeration to say that Pope Innocent III became a virtual ruler of Europe . In himself he combined the talents of an eminent jurist , gifted administrator and astute politician . The Papacy declined from the early fourteenth century on account of internal squabbles , weak and immoral successors , and the rise of national monarchies . The decline began when the French king , Philip IV succeeded in deposing the Pope , appointing his own candidate in his place and forcing him to stay in Avignon ( France ) as his subordinate in 1309 A.D. // Definition . Evolution of feudalism . Feudalism , a system of land tenure . Homage ceremony . Age of chivalry . Feudal life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ developments of the Middle Ages in Europe was the advent of Feudalism . It " developed out of a need to stabilize a society based on decentralized political power . " It began in France following the death of Emperor Charlamagne ( 814 A.D. ) and spread to many parts of disturbed Europe . It was not established by any King or Emperor as such but grew as a response to the chaotic conditions created by the barbarian invaders . Definition As feudalism appeared in a variety of forms , it is difficult to define it exactly . One may accept Stubb 's definition when he described it as a " complete organisation of society through the medium of land tenure in which from the king down to the lowest land owner all are bound together by obligation and defence ... " Evolution of Feudalism Feudalism was not a new thing or phenomenon since it developed in Ancient Egypt when the old kingdom declined . It prevailed in the Homeric Age . It also existed in a vague fashion in the Roman society when a wealthy landlord surrounded himself with clients @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form of an institution called Comitatus . Brave lads associated themselves with a powerful chief who provided food , shelter and weapons , to them . But during the middle of the tenth century it assumed a definite shape . // After the death of Charlamagne , central Europe was torn by a civil strife on the one hand and frequent invasions on the other by the Northmen of Scandinavia , the Magyars of the east and the Moors ( Arabs settled in Spain ) of the south . Lawlessness and disorder became the order of the day and there was no security to life and property since the central government had collapsed . The Emperor ruled only in name but could not command the loyalty of his subjects . It was under these conditions that relations between the people and the king underwent changes and gave rise to the birth of a new class called nobles . Feudalism , a System of Land Tenure . In theory the king owned all the lands in his kingdom and the nobles considered him as their overlord . He divided the land of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under his control he gave away the rest to his nobles on condition that they took the oath of loyalty and agreed to render military service . Thus , the nobles became his vassals and king the overlord . The land given to the nobles was called fief or feud um . The vassal became the virtual owner of the fief and governed it effectively . The vassal himself could not look after the whole fief himself and so gave away parts of it to his friends who agreed to become his vassals . This sub-division of land into parts and their distribution is called sub-infeudation . These lesser vassals were either barons or knights . The lesser vassals had to pay homage ' and render service to his lord , that is the noble . At the lowest rung of the ladder remained the serf ( agricultural labourer ) who owned the smallest bit of land and cultivated it . His life and property came to be protected as long as he pleased his master by rendering personal service . The church also owned lands and in the place of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second most important element in feudalism is the vassalage . The vassalage started usually after going through a ceremony called homage ' . The tenant knelt before his lord barehead and declared himself to be his man ' or vassal . He took a pledge to serve his liege-lord for life , promised specified number of fighting men ( forty days in a year ) , and agreed to attend the latter 's court . He further promised to pay for his lord 's ransom ( in case the lord is // captured by his enemies ) and also to bear a part of the expenses incurred at Lord 's daughter 's marriage or when his son was knighted . In return the lord promised the vassal his protection and justice , and invested him with the rights and privileges over the fief given to him . Age of Chivalry . The warriors were known as knights . They agreed to serve one powerful noble or the other and received from him a small estate ( say a village ) . At the time of his knighthood , a squire kneeled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sword on his shoulders and on his head . The knight promised loyalty to his lord . When the influence of the church increased , the knight took an oath of loyalty to the king , promised to protect the church and save the honour of women . During the age of chivalry , the knights played an important role in the society by discharging their duties faithfully . They volunteered and raised troops to fight the crusades . The knights rode on a horse fully equipped with weapons of war such as the sword , lance , and dagger , and in times of war or combat or tournaments he was fully protected with such things like shield , armour and helmet . Feudal Life . As noted above the king had limited powers and hardly came in contact with all the subjects of his kingdom . Loyalty of his subjects were divided . As the king ' s army was so small he depended upon his nobles or vassals . His revenue came mostly from his own domain . In course of time his nobles became powerful . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maintained an army and protected their subjects in their own domain . They built castles which were surrounded by moats . The castles protected not only the noble and his family but also his subjects in times of war . Often the nobles fought with one another . Feuds among the knights were common . Life for the common man was full of risk . We may say that the manorial system constituted the economic basis of the feudal society . The lord ' s estate and castle and those of his subordinates formed the manor ' . Sometimes the lord of the manor was a bishop . A lord lived with his family , servants , guards , fighting men and his serfs . As the castle was built on a small mound and well protected by a surrounding moat filled with water , it afforded the necessary protection to // people in times of danger . The outer wall of the castle had gateways with drawbridges . A drawbridge was used for a dual purpose , that is to keep out the enemy and allow people to cross the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it if need be . Outside the castle lay the village where the peasants lived in small huts . Each village had a mill , a blacksmith 's shop , a church and a small house of the priest . Beyond the village boundary lay the cultivated fields , meadows and woods . Onethird of the cultivated lands ? sometimes scattered here and there ? belonged to the lord . The rest of the land belonged to the peasants . Each peasant owned several strips of land ? good and bad ? scattered around the manor . The meadows , woods and common land belonged to the lord and his peasant . They were used for grazing of the animals and collection of firewood . A Three-field system was in vogue . In the three-field system , a peasant divided his land into there parts and cultivated barley , rye and wheat in two parts . The third part was kept fallow . Next year he cultivated in the first and the third parts and the second remained fallow . In this manner , each part lay fallow once in three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Each peasant grew vegetables , kept poultry and tended cows . As mentioned earlier each peasant or a serf who worked in the fields was a tenant of the lord . Peasants and serfs commended themselves to the service of their lord . So they were bound to the lord 's land , and used a part of his land for their own needs . Whenever there was a dispute , the lord settled the dispute in his court . Each peasant or serf received protection from the lord and for this he had to ( a ) work at least three days freely on the lord 's land , ( b ) give the lord a part of the revenue of his own land , and ( c ) make payment for getting the corn grinded and baking it for bread at the lord 's mill and oven respectively . The serf 's position was pitiable as he was neither a freeman nor a slave . He was bound to serve his lord throughout his life despite his miserable condition . He attended the church on all Sundays where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manor remained as a self-sufficient economic unit by itself with a barter system . Spices and salt were probably the only things which he got from outside . Whenever famines broke out , peasants and serfs died of // starvation It was not uncommon for a peasant to witness the destruction of his field when the enemies attacked his village or by a party of nobles hunting near his fields . Thus the lot of the peasant or the serf was miserable . Decline of Feudalism But conditions began to change slowly from the middle of the 14th century . A plague commonly known as the Black Death began to spread over the whole of Europe and took a heavy toll of one-third of the European population . In England the Black Death decimated half of the population . Peasants were not prepared to work in the fields till their wages were raised . It may be remembered that wages were paid in money currency in those days . The peasant 's revolt in 1381 in England did not succeed but the rulers tried to mitigate the sufferings of the serfs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in other parts of Europe the peasants and serfs continued to suffer from many disabilities till the outbreak of the French Revolution ( 1789 ) . While it is difficult to defend feudalism for all its ugly aspects like the bondage of the serfs and the existing inequalities in society , nevertheless , it provided the necessary stability to a society at a time when Europe was constantly being invaded by the barbarians . Feudalism provided the means of defence and a source of livelihood to those affected by foreign invasions and " supplied a rough and ready method of administration . " But in course of time it became obsolete and useless and inflicted heavy burden on the underprivileged . MEDIEVAL CITIES AND GUILDS Conditions in Europe After the Fall of the Roman Empire With the fall of the Roman empire , a number of cities and towns in Europe began to pale into insignificance . A few towns or cities which enjoyed natural protection of the sea or the rivers or the swamps survived the holocaust . Fortunately , towns like Paris , Marseilles , Tours , Naples , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old // Roman days . They survived despite the decline of the Roman empire because they lay on the trade routes . During the early Middle Ages , which is sometimes described as the Dark Age , these towns could not flourish because all trade carne to a standstill and gangs of bandits roamed about on the main roads to harass travellers and merchants . Merchants could not carry on trade because they had to pay heavy tolls on the borders . As precious metals became scarce , trade had to be carried on by barter system . The Europeans lost control over the Mediterranean sea and in their place came the Mohammedans . The church looked upon profit-making by Christian merchants as a great sin and so the Jews flourished as big merchants and money-lenders in Europe . Because of their trade , the Jews came to be hated ( known as anti-semitism ) by the European Christians . The whole picture began to gradually change when the invasions of the barbarians stopped by the ninth and tenth centuries , and feudalism began to gain a foothold in Europe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Old and new cities began to dot the map of Europe at the beginning of the eleventh century . Some cities began to grow where strong castles offered protection . Others grew around some famous monasteries . Some port cities began to grow along the coast of Italy , France , Spain and England . Crusades Caused the Growth of Towns : The Crusades of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries acted as a great catalyst and transformed life in Europe . Firstly , they indirectly brought about the end of feudalism . The destruction of the power of the nobles allowed towns and cities to play their legitimate role . Secondly , trade with oriental countries gave a fresh lease of life . Thirdly , the crusades gave opportunities to enterprising persons to purchase lands from Barons and establish free towns . It was however , the trade with the east which gave a great impetus to the revival of the old cities and towns and subsequently there occurred the birth of new towns . The European Christians who became accustomed to the luxuries of the orient demanded oriental products such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . fruits , sugar , glass , muslin and drugs . // Role of European Cities . The Italian cities like Venice , Genoa and Pisa lost no time in establishing trade links with the orient during the time of the Crusades . Their merchants brought goods from the oriental cities on land and by sea and distributed them to the towns of Europe . In northern Europe Flanders became a great centre of commerce and exchanged goods with other Baltic countries and England . These two centres in the south and the north , that is Venice and Flanders catered to the needs of people living inland . So inland trade routes developed and gave rise to the birth of new towns . The Italian port cities maintained contact with the port cities of France ( like Marseilles ) , Christian-Spain , and England . A number of port cities like Alexandria , Venice , Marseilles , London , Cologne , Hamburg , Nuremberg , Bremen , Lubeck and Briges along the Mediterranean , the North and the Baltic Sea coasts grew in importance . The French and Spanish towns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Granada . Every medieval town began to hold fairs during religious festivals like Christmas and Easter , and attracted a large number of merchants from far off places like Constantinople . One of such famous fairs was regularly held at Champagne in France where people gathered in large number not only to buy things from the colourful stalls but to enjoy the pleasures and entertainments provided by the city . Hanseatic League . A group of about seventy German cities formed an association called the Hanseatic League with the main aim of protecting their shipping from the pirates operating on the North and the Baltic Seas . In those days many Norsemen became pirates and preyed upon unwary merchant ships for plunder . The ships belonging to the Hanseatic League sailed in convoys and reached their destination safely . In the course of time the merchants of the Hanseatic League became extremely wealthy and powerful and even compelled kings to bow to their demands . The Hensa cities grew enormously rich and cosmopolitan in character . Political Role of the Cities . It must be remembered that during the height of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belonging to the feudal lords . These feudal lords extended their control over them and the people had to pay taxes . // The lords were indeed alarmed at the growing wealth of the towns and also for providing shelter to run-away serfs ( a run away serf became free if he was not caught after one year and one day ) . To be free from the clutches of the feudal lords , a town or a city paid huge sums of money as ransom . It received a charter in return which allowed her to have self-government and self-regulation of trade and industry . At the time of the crusades many nobles gave the charter of freedom to the cities and towns and collected huge sums of money . They required this amount to wage the holy war against the Muslims . After the crusades , the cities and towns helped their respective kings to destroy the power of the nobles . Thus they helped in paving the way for the growth of national monarchies in Europe . Even the Popes felt the urge to organise some cities into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ famous league which was organized for defence was the Lombard League in the twelfth century . The Rise of the New Middle Class in Towns and Cities . With the growth of towns and cities in Medieval Europe , we see the rise of a new Middle Class . They played an important role in making their city wealthy and powerful by working hard . They were educated and broad-minded . They loved freedom and gaiety . It was to them that the ancient Greek and Roman classics came to be introduced during the later medieval age . The middle-class towns people came to be called the bourgeoisie . In course of time the leading members of the Middle Class took active part in the deliberations of the Town Council . These members came either from the merchant section or from the master-craftsmen . Guilds and Crafts . With the growth of the population of cities and towns , there arose a demand-for products and their proper distribution . Merchants and craftsmen formed associations called guilds to control the business of a particular town or city . Guilds came to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merchant-guild was to protect and promote the interests of their members . For example , the merchant guild of a city regulated the quality of goods , prices , weights and measures , working conditions , wages , and to supervise business-ethics . Each member who joined the guild was bound by an oath taken at the time of his admission . The merchant // guilds in the town monopolised trade for themselves , excluded middlemen , prevented unhealthy competition and provided escorts for their travelling merchant-members . As mentioned earlier , the Hanseatic League controlling seventy German cities provided armed-convoys to its travelling members . The merchant guilds rendered a great service to the economic development of the towns and cities . Craft Guilds . When the towns grew big , the craftsmen there established their own guilds . In Paris there were more than hundred guilds . Each guild consisted of members or craftsmen belonging to a particular profession like bakers , butchers carpenters and so on The members of the guild were mostly mastercraftsmen who regulated quality , price and supply of their products . They trained boys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and opened their own shops in due course . The guilds saw to it that they were suitably employed . They opened schools for the children of craftsmen . The guilds helped craftsmen in many other ways by caring for their needs and providing social security . The guilds assisted the town or city government in building a great wall around the city for protection from foreign invaders . Guilds formed by Towns . Like the merchant guilds and craft guilds , a group of towns also formed their own guild for catering to mutual interests and protection . One such guild was the famous Hanseatic League with as many as seventy German towns joining . The traders of the member-towns opened a number of branches in Russia , Sweden , Denmark and England . Its influence was felt on the countries situated around the North and the Baltic seas . Decline of Guilds . With the passage of time guilds began to decline in power and wealth . It may be remembered that each guild had practised a kind of monopoly and did not allow competition . Therefore each member @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He employed wage-earners and paid them less . Not many journeymen ( graduated apprentices ) could hope to become master-craftsmen . When the states grew in power the guilds began to decline . The guild system finally disappeared after the advent of the Industrial Revolution . // MEDIEVAL UNIVERSITIES Learning in the Middle Ages A common man in the early Middle Ages hardly cared for Book learning . He had no sound knowledge of ' the classics or . anything that happened either in his own country or in the outside world . However , learning came to be encouraged by some wise rulers like Emperor Charlamagne and the Church . Every Church and monastery ran a school . Priests and monks taught students . But church schools only encouraged those ' subjects which were directly related to religion or encouraged religious outlook . They were designed to train students to become priests . But conditions began to improve from the eleventh century . People became interested in education because it provided a means for securing important positions in the services of the church and the state . With the growth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the church . Early Universities of Europe . The demand for higher education grew when the western Europeans came in contact with the Byzantine and Muhammedan civilisations . It led to the birth of centres of advanced learning called Universities in Europe during the thirteenth century . Universities were associations composed of masters and students . The university of Bologna was the earliest to be set up in Europe followed by others like Salerno , Paris , Heidelberg , Montpelier , Naples , Oxford , ' Cambridge , Toulouse and Salamanca . Young men crowded the portals of these universities and listened to lectures delivered by famous scholars . The university of Paris was undoubtedly the biggest with about 50,000 students attending lectures at one time in all the four faculties ? Arts , Canon Law , Medicine and Theology . Peter Abelard , a famous teacher and scholar ( incidentally the founder of this university ) , attracted a large number of students to his faculty ? the faculty of Theology . His book , Sic et Non ( " Yes " and " No " ) was banned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too much on quoted authorities on religious questions . Salerno 's medical faculty and Bologna 's law faculties similarly became famous all over Europe . During the twelfth century the university of Oxford in England // commenced working . By about the end of the thirteenth century there were about nineteen universities in Europe with famous teachers such as Peter Abelard and scholars like Roger Bacon , Thomas Aquinas and Albertus Magnus . Universities in those days had no big buildings to boast of as in modern days . Many a time the students sat on the floors and copied a text ( books were scarce ) which was slowly dictated to them by their professor with his explanations and notes . Their knowledge was tested by their teacher in classroom discussions and debates . The study of liberal arts was stressed as in the Ancient Roman schools . They included subjects like grammar , rhetoric , logic , geometry , arithmetic , astronomy and music . It is only after completing the study of these subjects successfully , students were allowed to study Law or Medicine or Theology . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ student after successfully completing his study including thorough examination ) within three or five years . Those who were qualified to teach from among the Bachelor degree holders received their Master 's degree after some years . This degree entitled them to become permanent teachers . A few universities also awarded Ph . D. ( Doctor of Philosophy ) to a few outstanding scholars . Student 's life . Students did not merely attend the universities . to acquire knowledge but wanted to prepare for a career . They had to suffer many hardships for the universities could not offer physical and material comforts . Despite these hardships , the students were devoted to studies . But the students in those days , like their modern counterparts , used to have newcomers , make fun of teachers , compose limericks and frequently fought with other rowdies . By way of conclusion , one can say that medieval universities , played an important role as centres of higher education and culture . In addition to providing many competent teachers to kindle interest among students in liberal arts , theology , philosophy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the advent of Renaissance in Europe . // Factors Aiding Geographical Discoveries Fortunately , many factors helped to realise the ambitions of European rulers and merchants . Of these the most important was the knowledge the Europeans derived from the Mariner 's compass and the astrolabe . The former was invented by the Chinese for knowing the direction and the latter in finding their way to reach a particular spot . Secondly , the Europeans began to build better ships which were used for a long journey . The sailors of the late fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries also gained useful knowledge about the winds , tides and currents from the school established by the Portuguese prince , Henry " the Navigator " ( 1394-1460 ) . Prince Henry 's School of Navigation attracted " the best sailors , astronomers and geographers of Europe " who exchanged their knowledge with others . The School sent annual maritime expeditions along the coastline of West Africa . His navigators discovered the Madiera islands and went as far as Sudan and Senegal . They brought slaves and gold and paved the way for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Explorations of Portuguese Navigators : The next few exploits of the Portuguese on sea included crossing of the equator by Lopo Gonsalves and reaching of the Cape of Storms ( called as the Cape of Good Hope ) by Bartholomew Diaz in 1487 . Ten years later Vasco da Gama set sail and followed the route , taken by Diaz . Crossing the Cape of Good Hope he sailed along the east coast for a short time . With the help of p ? t ; Arab sailors he found the direction to sail towards India . He reached Calicut in 1498 . Vasco da Gama 's discovery of a new sea-route to India was a most significant event in the history of not only Europe but of Asia also . Two years later , Cabral , a Portuguese commander , who was sailing down the west coast of Africa , was blown off his course by a storm // and at last reached the east coast of South America . Thus Brazil was discovered in 1500 . Columbus discovers the continent : In all probability the Vikings were the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the Roman Empire was being invaded by the barbarians . After about a thousand years or so , Christopher Columbus , a Genoese sailor , planned to discover a new sea route to the East . After securing monetary assistance from King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella , he set sail on 3 August 1492 across the then unknown Atlantic . After a long and difficult voyage he reached an island of the Bahamas on 12 , Oct 1492 . He thought that he had reached the shores of India . He called the natives of the Bahamas Indians . He went to explore Cuba and Haiti . He made three more voyages and explored the islands in the Caribbean Sea . He claimed all the lands that he had discovered for his king and queen . The Portuguese became jealous of the newly acquired lands of Spain and the Pope had to intervene to settle their dispute by demarcating the line of control for each . But the new continent of America that Columbus discovered came to be called after the name of an Italian explorer , Amerigo Vespucci . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and came to the conclusion that it was not India ( as Columbus believed ) but a new world . It was for this reason that a German geographer " suggested that the New World be called America in Amerigo 's honour . " Balboa Discovered the Pacific Ocean in 1513 : Vasco Nunez de Balboa , a Spanish explorer , went to the new world in search of gold . He reached the Isthmus of Panama and looked over the other side . What he saw was a vast expanse of blue ocean ... the Pacific Ocean . Ponce de Leon discovered Florida . Ferdinand Magellan ? His Voyage Round the World ( 1519-22 ) : Magellan who had come to India along with Vasco da Gama was certain that the world was a globe . He desired to find a westward passage to the east . When the Portuguese ruler turned down his proposal to finance the project , he did not lose hope . He appealed to the Spanish King Charles I ( grandson of Queen Isabella ) who agreed to help him . With five ships and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ September 1519. // He reached the coast of South America and sailed down towards the south .

He reached the Philippines . It was here that he was killed in a battle with the natives . His ship Victoria ' carrying some crew reached Spain in 1522 . It was a long voyage undertaken to circumnavigate the world . Hernando Cortez and Francisco Pizarro . Hernando Cortez proved to be one of the greatest Spanish conquistadors of the early sixteenth century . He with his soldiers landed in Mexico and fought the natives called the Aztecs and defeated them . After driving out their ruler Cortez became the Spanish governor . In 1533 , another Spanish adventurer by name Francisco Pizarro invaded Peru and defeated the Inca ruler . He set up a puppet and the Incas became angry . But the Spaniards executed all the Inca rulers and so the Incas could not organise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Peru to work in silver and gold mines for their benefit . When there was increasing resistance , the Spaniards began to bring negroes from Africa to work there . The Spanish missionaries converted many natives to Christianity . Thus Spain built a large empire on the new continent . Discoveries of English Explorers : Among the many explorers who were trying to find a new sea-route to the east in the late 15th century , there was an Italian by name John Cabot . He was ernployed by King Henry VII to discover a north-west passage across the Atlantic to India . He set sail in 1497 , crossed the Atlantic and reached Cape Breton island ( near Newfoundland ) . Cabot thought that he had reached China . It was his discovery of the east coast of Canada which made the English to claim much of North America . During the last quarter of the sixteenth century , the English explorers like Drake , Gilbert and Raleigh further explored the east coast of North America and laid claims to territories from St. Lawrence to Florida . The English @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early seventeenth century . French explorations : Like the early English explorers , a Frenchman by name Jacques Cartier sailed up to the coast // of North America for finding a north-west passage to China . He discovered St. Lawrence river in 1535 . In 1608 , another French explorer , Champlain Marquette , discovered Quebec . Joilet explored the Missisippi river valley in 1573 . La Salle explored the mouth of Mississippi . So France claimed all the regions from St. Lawrence river in Canada to the mouth of the Mississippi river . The northern part of this region was called New France and the southern part Louisiana ( named after King Louis XIV ) . Henry Hudson and the Dutch Claim : In 1609 the Dutch employed an English explorer by name Henry Hudson who tried to find a north-west passage . He discovered the Hudson river and enabled the Dutch to claim the Hudson river region . The Dutch also tried to penetrate through the northern barrier of Ice Land but did not succeed . However , their explorer Berents discovered Spitsbergen , a group of islands in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Each European power laid its claim to extensive areas she had discovered and which was not liked by her rival . So wars were fought among rival European powers on the new continent . For example , the Portuguese fought the Dutch in the East . They became jealous of Spanish possessions on the new continent and posed a challenge . England and France also became rivals on the new continent and carried on wars in Europe and India . In the late sixteenth century England and Spain became bitter rivals and the Spanish Armada threatened to invade England . But the Spaniards were defeated on the sea . Results of Geographical Discoveries : Let us examine the farreaching effects of these geographical discoveries on the nations of Europe in general and the world in particular . By and large the most far-reaching effect was on European trade and commerce . There was a conspicuous shift in the venue of the maritime trade from the Mediterranean region to the Atlantic . Alexandria , Pisa , Genoa and Venice which gained commercial importance during the Middle Ages yielded place to the new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Antwerp and London . The newly discovered Cape Route assumed great importance on account of the sea-borne trade // between the West and the East till the construction of the Suez Canal in 1869 . The discovery of America and a new sea-route to the East introduced a wide variety of commodities hitherto unknown to the Europeans . They were potatoes , chocolate , cocoa , tobacco , quinine , canesugar , whale-oil , dyewoods , indigo , tea , coffee porcelain . The Indian textiles and Persian carpets were in great demand in the European markets . European explorers brought large quantities of precious metals like gold and silver from the new continent . Mexico and Peru were known for hidden treasures and they were ransacked by the avaricious explorers . With a large amount of money in circulation in Europe , employment , wages and the standard of living showed a great deal of improvement . One of the ugliest effects of geographical discoveries was the birth of colonisation by the European powers . The European powers reached the shores of the countries of Africa , Asia and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they stayed there as conquerors and masters . These countries were turned into colonies and subjected to political and economic exploitation . Negroes in Africa were taken to Europe , Britain , and America and sold in the open market as slaves . Colonial rule was established by European powers over their respective colonies with a view to civilise its people . It was during this colonial regime of European powers that Asiatic and African countries witnessed grinding poverty . On the other side , the European powers grew wealthy at the expense of their respective colonies . The industrial revolution in the West hastened further exploitation of the colonies since the European powers needed much of their raw materials . Other Results : Other results which followed in the wake of geographical discoveries were the changes in the social order of Europe such as the birth of the middle class ( bourgeoisie class ) , the rise of absolute monarchy , large scale emigration of people ( escaping from religious persecution ) and the spread of the activities of Christian missionaries in the colonies . The voyages of the Explorers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Europe . The geographical discoveries thus paved the way for the Western domination of the world . // Factors for the growth of Renaissance . Renaissance Scholars . Renaissance Art . Venetian School : Titian ( 1477-1576 ) . Renaissance sculpture . Renaissance architecture . Renaissance Music . Renaissance in Northern Europe . England-France-Spain . Renaissance and Scientific Progress . Scientific thought and Scientists . It is difficult to say precisely when the Middle Ages ended and the Modern times began . Many historians believe that in between these two ages there lay a period of transition ? the Age of Renaissance . The term Renaissance ' is French which simply means rebirth . Many historians used the concept Renaissance ' to give the impression that it followed " the dark years of the Middle Ages . " Now this theory , that the Middle Age was the dark age , is discarded . Currently this term Renaissance is used to denote " a rebirth of Greco-Roman spirit of scientific curiosity and of . humanism in arts and letters . " The Renaissance in Europe became an intellectual movement and spread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the middle of the 14th century to the end of the 16th century . It primarily found expression in the revival of the study of ancient Greco-Roman classics , the revival of art and growth of humanism . Unknowingly the Renaissance scholars and artists breathed a new spirit and enriched , through their contributions the quality of human life . They enabled people of Europe to have a new and rational approach towards life . Factors for the Growth of Renaissance What were the factors responsible for the advent of the Renaissance ? The capture of Constantinople by the Ottoman Turks in 1453 A.D. , is said to have triggered off many things . The // Greek scholars there fled in panic with their ancient classics and settled in Western Europe . It was in Italy that they found new patrons . For years the Italian nobles and merchants had received rich dividends on account of the brisk trade with the rest of Europe . Their direct contact with the Arab traders enabled them to import oriental commodities for their final distribution to Europe . It was in the great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and crusaders " brought back new ideas , as well as spices , perfumes , and other Iuxuries . " The weakness of the church made them bold to encourage new learning . It is no wonder that a large number of merchants , bankers and few churchmen were associated with the patronage extended to the immigrant scholars . Finally , the invention of the printing press rendered it possible for the rapid spread of Renaissance scholarship . Renaissance Scholars . The Renaissance scholars and writers came to be called humanists because they dealt with topics which were concerned more with humanity than with religion . They wrote not in Latin but in their own native languages . Thus the language of the people attained the status of literature . The foremost among the Renaissance scholars in Italy were Dante ( 1265-1321 ) , Petrarch ( 1304-1374 ) and Boccaccio ( 1313-1375 ) . Dante , a poet par excellence ( sometimes known as the " Father of Italian poetry " ) , came to be widely known for his epic poem Divina Cornedia . It deals with the journey to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pleasures in heaven attracted the attention of many . What impressed his admirers most was his fearless thoughts and expressions . Petrarch is now known as " the first modern man , for staging the first humanist revolt against scholasticism . He was the first Italian scholar to arouse the interest of many in the Greek and Roman classics . He carried on the relentless task of searching long-lost manuscripts in ancient monasteries . He wrote his famous Latin love sonnets and lyrics , the most noteworthy being Sonnets to Laura . His disciple was Boccaccio who entertained his fellowmen with a collection of love stories called De Cameron . Political strife and instability prevailing generally among the Italian states in the 15th and early 16th centuries made Niccolo Machiavelli ( 1469-1527 ) write The Prince . // It became a well known work and was studied particularly by the rulers and political leaders of the time . In that book Machiavelli suggested that any available means ? fair or unfair ? should be made use of by a ruler to fulfil the goal of maintaining political stability of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideas have since then influenced the minds of rulers and politicians alike even to this day . Renaissance Art . Thanks to the renowned Medici family , Florence in Italy became a glorious centre of Renaissance art . A large number of famous artists were employed in the creation of works of art . Of these , Leonardo da Vinci ( 1452-1519 ) , Michelangelo ( 1475-1564 ) and Raphael may be considered as outstanding . Leonardo da Vinci was a versatile genius of the age whose works in painting , sculpture , mathematics , botany , geology and hydraulics have earned him a niche in the temple of genius . He even foresaw the coming of flying machines . His immortal works in painting are Monalisa ' and The Last Supper ' . He adopted new painting techniques and experimented with oil paints to give his work a fine feeling of reality . The next artist of great repute was Michelangelo . His paintings decorate the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel in the Vati can . When the Pope commissioned him for this job , he took four years to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His most famous work is The Last Judgment ' . Michelangelo 's , " main interest was sculpture where he remained unsurpassed . Since the time of ancient Greeks none had shown so much interest in carving a natural human figure to perfection . But Michelangelo exhibited his great skill as can be seen in the giant statues of Leonardo I3a Vinci Moses and David . " Grandeur of design , tragic driving force , and deep religious emotion make // Michelangelo unique as an artist . " One more important work which was assigned to Michelangelo by the Pope was to design the dome of St. Peter 's Church which was being constructed then . After very hard work he designed the most perfect dome , a model of which came to be copied later on . The third great artist of the Florentine school was Raphael Sanzio ( 1483-1520 ) . His paintings , mostly Madonnas , have been admired by all for their unsurpassing beauty and calmness . To a viewer his paintings gave not only width and height ( two dimensions ) but depth ( third dimension @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' . As an architect he helped in designing the St. Peter 's Church . His premature death cut short his otherwise glorious career as a great master-artist . Venetian School ? Titian ( 1477-1576 ) : Venice produced her own school of artists . Herantists generally produced landscapes and portraits . The most celebrated painter of Venice was Titian . In his long career ( be lived up to 99 years ) as an artist he produced more than seven hundred paintings which included portraits of many Popes , merchants , nobles and ladies . He became famous as a realistic portrait painter . Renaissance Sculpture : Progress in sculpture went hand in hand with paintings . The sculptors mostly followed the techniques of classical transition . Lorenzo Ghiberti became famous after producing the " magnificent doors for the Baptistery at Florence . " The next gifted sculptor was Donatello who produced , among other things , his best work , that is the statue of St. George in Florence . Lucadella Robbia produced glazed terracotta figurines . Lorenzo de Medici , the ruler of Florence , had his beautiful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Renaissance architecture in Italy rejected the Gothic style and imitated the classical architecture of the Greeks and Romans . Round arches , tall columns and big domes became the principal features of architecture . Typical of Renaissance architecture in Italy is the St. Peter 's Church in Rome . Its great dome ( designed by Michelangelo ) rises to a height of more than 400 feet above the ground level . This church is big enough to hold a mass for 80,000 people . Close on the lines of St. Peter 's Church we see St. Mark 's in Venice and St. Paul 's Church in London . What distinguishes Renaissance architecture from classical architecture is the // emphasis laid on design and ornamentation . Besides Churches , Renaissance architecture found its expression in public buildings and palaces . Brunelleschi designed the Pitti palace in Florence . The other palaces in the style of Renaissance architecture were the Farnese palace in Rome and the Piccolomini palace in Siena . Renaissance architecture wielded its influence for centuries and " was introduced into the United States by Thomas Jefferson in designing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Middle Ages was religious music or Church music . It was to serve the religious purpose . But during the time of Renaissance it was gradually transformed to serve humanity under the influence of humanism . Besides vocal music , instrumental music became popular with the introduction of new instruments such as the harpsichord , the violin and the lute . Orchestral music became popular . Though the Renaissance in music was largely the work of Flemish composers , its popularity was increased in the sixteenth century Europe by the Italian composer , Palestrina ( 1525-1594 ) . He composed about 100 masses . He is considered by many as " the father of modern music " on account of the impact he made on later musical composers . In the course of time Europe witnessed the age of operas ( setting the drama to music ) . RENAISSANCE IN NORTHERN EUROPE England The Renaissance and the Humanist movement spread beyond the Alps in the fifteenth century . In Britain it began in the fifteenth century and reached glorious heights during the Elizabethan times . It found expression in the work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among them were Geoffrey Chaucer with his work Canterbury Tales , SirThomis More with his Utopia ( in Latin suggesting the creation of an ideal state ' ) , Francis Bacon with his Essays , Edmund Spenser with his Faerie Queene , Christopher Marlowe with his Doctor Faustus and Ben Jonson with his drama Volpone . But the most prominent personalities in Renaissance English literature were William Shakespeare and John Milton . Shakespeare " broke with classical - concepts of drama and established an English form . " His plays // ( both tragedies and comedies ) reveal two great qualities ? his unsurpassed mastery over the English language and a deep understanding of human nature and human mind . The advent of the English theatre added a new feature to the public entertainment in those days . In English epic poetry , John Milton 's Paradise Lost , Paradise Regained and Samson Agonistes still remains unrivalled and unsurpassed . France France was also deeply affected by the pervading spirit of the Renaissance . Outstanding among her writers who enriched French literature were Montaigne ( 1533-1592 ) , Francois Rebelais ( 1494-1553 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subject " in a direct and lucid style " . Francois Rebelais was a satirical writer whose work Gargantua and Pantagruel became quite popular . It was a satire on the clergy and the educational methods of the time . John Calvin became famous not only as a religious reformer but also for his " polemical writings " . Spain Cervantes was an accomplished writer in Spanish whose novel Don Quixote set in satirical fashion ridiculed the customs , notions and manners of the Middle Ages . Humour and sadness are well brought out in this novel . Lope De Vega became famous as the true founder of the Spanish drama and had great works to his credit . Another noted poet in Spain was Calderon . In the field of art , Spain produced famous painters like El Greco , Velasquez and Murillo . El Greco became famous for " his swirling , angular , and statuesque compositions with their use of light ... " Velasquez achieved popularity for his portraits . He became the Spanish court painter whose portraits show " realism and superlative handling of colour . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 11 paintings for the almhouse of St. Jorge , 1661-74 , are regarded as his masterpieces .

RBNA1SS NCE IN EUROPE 155 , was trained as a faithful priest , he lost no time in ridiculing the church for its " malpractices " and " corruption " in his famous pamphlet , In Praise of Folly . His criticism was aimed at bringing about reforms in the church . He worked hard to bring about the Latin translation of the Greek New Testament . One of the greatest Dutch painters was Rembrandt ( 1606-1669 ) whose most famous painting is " The Night Watch " . There were others like Jan Vermeer and Frans Hals . Flemish School : Even before Italy witnessed Renaissance painting , there was the Flemish school in Flanders which produced great painters like Jan and Hubert Van Eyck . They discovered the use of oil painting and its effects on its viewers . They broke away from medieval traditions and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jan 's painting ' Annunciation , ' became famous as it " gave religious and secular character " . Peter Paul Rubens became the greatest seventeenth century Flemish painter known for his religious themes such as The Descent from the Cross ' . The next noted painter was Van Dyck ( a pupil of Rubens ) who was patronised by Stuart rulers of Britain . He painted the portrait of Charles I. His distinctive style and touch influenced many of his contemporaries . Germany From Italy the Renaissance spread to northern Europe . One of the countries affected by the Renaissance was Germany . The Humanist movement had a profound impact on German scholars . One of them was Martin Luther who was to lead the Reformation movement during the sixteenth century . He translated the Holy Bible into German . In painting , Matthias Grunewald ( 1480-1528 ) , Albrect Durer ( 1471-1528 ) , Lucas Cranach and Hans Holbein the Younger became famous .

Siger de Brabant and his followers believed that " reason and philosophy were superior to faith and knowledge from faith . " A fierce dispute arose which led St. Thomas Aquinas to defend the Church by his work Summa Theologica . Roger Bacon ( 1214-94 ) insisted on scientific temper and " empirical observation " . He believed that a man 's rational character or behaviour was a natural law " which " manifested divine insight " . His ideas were found to be dangerous and he was imprisoned . He manufactured gunpowder and used magnifying glass . The first half of the fifteenth century witnessed the study of navigation and improvement in navigational instruments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ till the sixteenth century that the Renaissance made its great impact . The result was a scientific revolution in Europe . It began with the Polish monk as well as an astronomer , Nicolas Copernicus ( 1473-1543 ) , who challenged the medieval concept of astronomy based on Ptolemy 's geocentric system . After rejecting it Copernicus proposed what is now known as the heliocentric system ( in his book De Revolutionibus Orbiurn Caelestiurn ) according to which the Earth , Moon and Planets and stars orbit around the Sun . Kepler ( 1571-1630 ) supported the hypothesis of Copernicus by formulating mathematical laws . He improved upon Copernican theory by saying that the planets revolved round the Sun not in circle ( as Copernicus believed ) but in elleptical orbits . But the final credit of substantiating the Copernican theory with necessary proof went to an Italian astronomer , Galileo ( 1564-1642 ) . By inventing the telescope and observing the motions of heavenly bodies he could prove Copernicus ' theory by and large correct . When Galileo tried to prove that the theory of Copernicus was correct through a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ challenging its belief and authority . His book was burnt . At that time Giordano Bruno was burnt as a heretic for propagating the same idea . Galileo saved himself by publicly retracting his // views . Galileo 's research in mechanics , paved the way for Newton 's laws of motion and therefore , he was called " Father of Experimental Science " . But the genius of modern science in the seventeenth century was an Englishman , Sir Isaac Newton ( 1642-1727 ) . In his most famous work , Philosophiae Natural 's Principia Mathenaatica , he explained the laws of motion and propounded the law of universal gravitation . Newton also enriched the field of mathematics with his contributions , which of course , included his newly invented calculus . A century earlier , Rene Descartes ( 1596-1650 ) , French philosopher and . mathematician , introduced " mathematical principles to scientific problems . " He invented Analytical Geometry .

Anton Van Leeuwenhoek ( 1632-1723 ) , a Dutch biologist. made a single-lens microscope and discovered protozoa and bacteria in 1677 and 1683 respectively . Interest in science began to grow steadily in the seventeenth century with the result that encyclopaedias of scientific knowledge came to be published . The wonders of scientific discoveries and inventions compelled rulers , nobles and the wealthy to advance the cause of science . Thus the Humanist movement . of the Renaissance period finally culminated in ushering the . age of Modern Science . Were it not for the efforts of scholars like Francis Bacon ( 1561-1626 ) ( founder of principles of scientific method ) science would not have become so popular in the seventeenth century .

The Society of Jesus founded by Ignatius Loyola ( 1534 ) . St. Francis Xavier ( 1506-1552 ) . Europe witnessed the division of the Christian Church'in the sixteenth century after a religious movement called the Reformation . The Reformation was primarily aimed at reforming the Roman Catholic Church . It may be remembered that the Roman Catholic Church was a medieval institution claiming Jesus Christ as its earliest founder and therefore its sanctity and authority came to be very much respected by all the Christians . However . like other medieval institutions , it developed cracks and became vulnerable . The Popes considered themselves infallible , expected meek obedience to their authority by the people and the state , and any criticism levelled against them was regarded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to defy the orders of the Church or stop its interference in matters exclusively coming under state jurisdiction . Then how was it that the Church came to be so much discredited in the 16th century ? Decline of the Papacy The reasons are not far to seek . Pious Christians all over Europe were extremely concerned about the decline in the prestige of the Papacy . At one time the successive Popes who were elected were all Frenchmen . It may be remembered th at // the French influence on the papacy began when the French King forced Pope Clement V to leave his headquarters at Rome in 1309 and stay in Avignon ( France ) . The Papacy further declined in consequence of the " Great Schism " when two rival Popes ( one in Rome and the other in Avignon ) were elected and claimed allegiance from the Christians . To add to this confusion a third Pope was elected in 1409 . The Great Schism ended in 1417 but it had caused irreparable damage to the Papacy . During the Middle Ages the Church accumulated vast wealth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it collected what was known as the " Peter 's pence " and also the tithe ( one-tenth of income ) . The Popes and the priests lived in luxury and did not strictly conform to the ethics such as celibacy , chastity and exemplary conduct . There was a general laxity in carrying out the ecclesiastical duties . In their struggle for power and pelf they forgot all about the service to be rendered to God and mankind . State Vs. the Church : The rulers of Europe cast their envious look on the growing power and wealth of the Church . The wealth of the Church could not be taxed . The Church established its own courts to punish those guilty of religious offences . It frequently interfered in state matters . It did not tolerate criticisms about the way it was functioning and those who were guilty of it were burnt at the stake . Rise of nation-states . With the rise of powerful nationstates such as England , France and Spain , the Church , for the first time , had to meet the challenge of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supremacy of the Church and considered it as a great hindrance to the well-being of their states . After a long struggle these rulers were successful in wrenching some of the powers of the Church such as nominating the church officials , limiting the jurisdiction of the church courts , controlling the enforcement of papal decrees and levying taxes on church property . Rise of secular attitude : The rise of a secular outlook was an important feature of the pre-Reformation period . This secular outlook developed among the people mainly on account of the rapidly expanding commerce and the growth of the // cities . Many people believed that there was nothing wrong in acquiring wealth if the world offered them opportunities . Merchants believed in worldly life and thought less of religion . So the changing attitudes of people towards the Church brought about the rise of secularism . Unfortunately , the Church itself had to be blamed because it had lowered its own image by accumulating wealth . The common peasants in Europe looked upon church taxes with contempt . They believed that if the Church got reformed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lands . Anti-Church Movements : Anti-church movements began to be organised from the early 12th century . The Albigensians and the Waldenses were in the forefront in France . They attacked the church sacraments and priesthood . Under the leadership of successive Popes crusades were declared to destroy them . In England , John Wycliffe ( 1328-84 ) , a priest andr professor , criticised the worldliness of the clergy and othee practices of the Church . He declared that the Bible be the sol guide to men 's spiritual thoughts and conduct . For this purpose he translated the Holy Bible into English . His followers were known as Lollards who became influential . But the Church took steps to curb their activities . John Huss ( 1369-1415 ) , a Bohemian priest and professor , who condemned the Church for its corruption , was burnt at the stake in 1415 . But the anti-church movements did not altogether disappear . In the late fifteenth century , Savonarola ( 1452-98 ) established corrupt-free rule in Florence and attacked the corruption of the Church with the result that he was burnt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : The growth of the humanist movement from the middle of the fourteenth century did much to discredit the pretensions of the Church . The humanist scholar , Reuchlin " pointed out the inconsistencies of the interpretations of scholastic theologians , made on the basis of a literal use of the text of the Bible . " Erasmus was undoubtedly the greatest humanist scholar of this century who condemned the corruption and behaviour of the monks and priests . But he was cautious enough ( being a clergyman himself ) not to advocate an open revolt against the Church . What he desired most was // reforms within the Church . Unfortunately , Pope Leo X , barely understood the danger signal . Sale of indulgences : Regardless of the criticisms levelled against the Church , be collected money from the people through his agents to build the Basillica of St. Peter 's Church . Some of the methods the Pope and his agents adopted were highly questionable according to conscientious Christians . But they kept quiet . In Germany , the sale of indulgences by the Pope 's agent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Protestant Reformation in Germany : Luther was born in a well-to-do German peasant family . His father wanted him to become a lawyer but fate decided otherwise . He became a monk . From the day of his initiation Luther was concerned very much with the attainment of salvation . He was convinced that God alone could help a man to attain salvation . Therefore , he believed that faith in Him would be the only means to attain salvation . He visited Rome in 1511 and was shocked to witness the worldliness and " spiritual emptiness " of the Catholic Church . His pent up anger burst forth when John Tetzel started his scandalous sale of indulgences . Tetzel claimed that those who bought the " indulgences " got an automatic remission of their sins by God . Martin Luther , who had then become a professor in the newly started university at Wittenberg , attacked the very concept which lay behind the sale of indulgences by nailing his Ninety-Five Theses on the door of the Castle-Church at Wittenberg . He did not believe in the " Catholic idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ implied in the sale of " indulgences " and enunciated the doctrine of " justification by faith . " His Ninety-Five Theses got wide publicity in Germany and the sale of indulgences received lukewarm response . The Church officials met to persuade him to recant his views but he remained firm . Luther wrote letters to // the Pope with a view to convince him . Furthermore , he wrote a number of pamphlets to defend his theses . He further championed the right of the individual to seek his own salvation without the assistance of the Church . They could take the assistance of the Holy Bible whenever the need arose . In other words , he rejected the infallibilty of the Pope and the doctrines of the Church . The Pope sent a bull of excommunication declaring Luther as a heretic which Luther defiantly burnt in the presence of Wittenberg in public . In 1521 , Emperor Charles V summoned Luther to the Diet of Worms to answer charges levelled against him by the Pope . Despite urging by many of his friends not to attend this congress . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decreed for his arrest . But Luther 's protector , Frederick the Wise ( Duke of Saxony ) , saved his life by forcing him to hide . So Luther went into hiding in a lonely castle for nearly a year where he translated the Holy Bible into German . Before he went into hiding Luther had urged the German princes to defy the authority of the Roman Catholic Church in their respective states . Accordingly many German princes of the north lost no time in raising their banner of revolt against the Catholic Church and formed a league to protect Luther . The Lutheran Churches were established everywhere . All the Lutheran states and towns in Germany joined the Protest movement against the Emperor in 1529 . Despite many obstacles in his way Martin Luther was able to spread his convictions through the support of the princes of northern and central Germany and also with the support of the middle class . But a strong reaction to Luther 's religious revolution came in the form of bloody religious conflict dividing Germany into Catholic led by Emperor Charles V and Protestant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ended in the Peace of Augsburg ( 1555 ) . This peace acknowledged the right of a ruler to determine his state religion . Thus , the prestige of the Catholic Church led by the Pope and that of the German Emperor suffered . Ulrich Zwingli ( 1484-1531 ) and John Calvin ( 1509-1564 ) : Luther 's Protestant movement spread far beyond Germany 's borders . His writings influenced many intellectuals , particularly // that aspect wherein he held that every individual enjoyed the right to interpret the Bible in his own way . One of those who was influenced by Luther 's writings was a young priest in Switzerland by the name Ulrich Zwingli . He became the leader of Protestant movement in Switzerland and organised a new Church in the Swiss city of Zurich . His views spread and there was a war between Catholics and Protestants in which he was killed ( 1531 ) . So the Reformation movement in Switzerland received a setback . However , a few years later , a French Reformer , John Calvin ( 1509-1564 ) , began to effectively lead the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ account of the religious persecution taking place in his country and finally settled in the Swiss city-state of Geneva . It was here that his religious teachings took deep roots and spread to the neighbouring Swiss cantons . He set up a Calvinist church which enforced strict moral rule on its citizens . His most important doctrine was that of the Doctrine of " predestination " which he popularised in his book , Institutes of the Christian Religion . This doctrine says " that God chooses His own elect , " and they live in total righteousness in this world and " enjoy salvation in the next . " Geneva became a great centre of Reformation where the Calvinist doctrines spread through the graduates of the University of Geneva . Many foreigners who studied in this university spread Calvinism to Netherlands , Hungary , France , Scotland and England . The teachings and doctrines of Calvin were followed by the Presbyterian Church in Scotland ( organised by John Knox ) , the Dutch Reformed Church in Holland , the churches of Puritans in England and America , and the Huguenot Church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Catholic Church and for what it stood had its beginning in the lollard movement ( led by the followers of John Wycliffe ) in the fourteenth century . There were other factors such as the influence of Renaissance humanism and the general laxity and corruption prevailing in the Church that made England ripe for Reformation . Unfortunately , the anti-church movement lacked organisation and leadership . It appeared as though the Reformation movement would not succeed in England . However it began due to a peculiar logic of circumstance . King // Henry VIII 's ( reign 1509-47 ) marital relationship with his first wife , Catherine of Aragon ( who could not produce a male heir ) , became the cause for the break with the Catholic Church at Rome . His petition to the Pope to grant him permission to divorce his first wife had not found favourable response becauseCatherine was the aunt of Pope 's closest ally , Emperor Charles V. The reason for the impatience of the English king was that he wanted to marry his mistress , Anne Boleyn . Indignant and disappointed at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mantle of leadership of the Reformation movement in England . He got the subservient English Parliament to nullify Pope 's power over the Churches in England by its act , the Act of Supremacy . This act made him the Protector and only Supreme Head of the Church and Clergy of England . After becoming the head of the Anglican Church he confiscated the properties of monasteries and churches . Very few changes were introduced in the doctrines and rituals of the Anglican Church . An English translation of the Bible found its place in every church . During the reign of Henry VIII 's successor , Edward VI , the Anglican Church leaned more towards Protestant doctrines . But when staunch Catholic , Queen Mary ( sometimes known as Bloody Mary ' ) ascended the throne ( 1553-58 ) , she unleashed a ruthless persecution of the Protestants . Many of them were driven into exile and about 300 were burnt at the stake . Mary 's successor , Queen Elizabeth ( 1555-1603 ) , assumed the title of " Supreme Governor " and followed a middle path by avoiding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Church . She was able to restore religious harmony during a period of crisis . THE COUNTER-REFORMATION Thus , the Reformation movement shcok the foundation of the Roman Catholic Church from the early 1500 and brought about the birth of the Protestant Church . To stem the tide of growing unpopularity , the Roman Catholic Church adopted a series of measures . The Inquisition ( the Church Court ) founded in Spain began its work of punishing the clergy who were found guilty of corruption , laxity and moral turpitude . In its enthusiasm to suppress heresy by repression , it alienated the sympathy of many , especially of those living in the Netherlands . They revolted against Spain and finally became independent . In the // meanwhile Pope Paul II convened a conference at Ratisbon in 1541 with the hope of uniting the two churches but his mission failed . The Council of Trent ( 1545-63 ) In 1545 Pope Paul III convened the Church Council at Trent which met several times between 1545 and 1563 . This council took positive steps to refurbish the image of the Catholic Church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . the Pope is the head of the Church and the ultimate interpreter of the Bible and the Church doctrines , ( 2 ) the traditional Latin translation of the Holy Bible should he treated as the authoritative version , ( 3 ) only the Church has the right to interpret the scriptures and ( 4 ) introduced following reforms : ( a ) condemned and prohibited the sale of indulgences and of the offences of the Church , ( b ) decided to ensure that church officials were properly educated , trained , and disciplined , ( c ) that sermon be preached in the Vernacular language ( d ) revived the Holy Inquisition to root out heresy , ( e ) introduced the Papal Index ( i.e. , press censorship ) to prevent publication of any book which go contrary to the teachings of the Catholic faith . The Society of Jesus Founded by Ignatius Loyola ( 1534 ) The second phase of Counter-Reformation began with the founding of different religious orders at the instance of the Pope . The most famous was the Society of Jesus which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had a strange religious experience while undergoing treatment and rest in a hospital after being wounded in a battle . He turned into a missionary after studying the life of Jesus Christ and other Saints . He studied Theology in Sorbonne university . He established the Jesuit order with only six followers to begin with after taking the consent of the Pope . He and his followers swore to lead a life of poverty , chastity and " service to God and Christianity " . The strength of the Jesuit order increased and they all rendered yeoman 's service to God and humanity in different parts of the world . // St. Francis Xavier ( 1506-1552 ) : One of the Jesuit followers of Ignatius Loyola was Francis Xavier who spent the last 12 years of his life in Japan , India and other parts of Asia . He was raised to Sainthood . His body is placed at the Church of Born Jesus in old Goa . Thus selfless and dedicated work carried out by these Jesuits went a long way in restoring the grandeur and glory of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AND FRANCE England ? The first nation-state in Europe . Royal absolutism . Limitations on royal Power . Model Parliament ( 1295 ) . Tudor Rulers . France ? Bourbon Monarchy in France . Spain  --  Englightened Despotism . The concept of Nation-State is of modern origin . It developed probably in the late Middle Ages . Prior to this , people of a particular country thought not in terms of having belonged to a particular country but as a citizen of a particular town or a city . A man who lived in London did not consider himself as an Englishman but as a Londoner . Then how did the NationStates emerge ? When feudalism thrived in Europe , the people 's loyalty was directed towards their liege-lords . But when any of their lords did not return from the Crusades , the kings of Europe began to establish their contacts with their respective subjects . They put an end to the power of the nobles . They used gunpowder ( a state monopoly ) to destroy castles of the nobles . So by the late Middle Ages the kings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . However , their struggle did not end after crushing the power of the nobles . The Church became a serious rival . Its authority began to increase and sometimes encroached on the jurisdiction of the State . The kings did not like the international connection and loyalty of their respective state churches . A few of them supported anti-church movements . Conditions began to change by the middle of the 14th century . The power of the Church declined . Growth of trade and commerce resulted in the birth of a new middle-class which became a staunch supporter of an enlightened monarchy . Medieval ideas and notions were // swept away after the discovery of new lands . Europe witnessed the revival of strong monarchies everywhere which worked for nationalist self-interest . England , the First Nation-State in Europe The earliest nation-state to emerge on the European continent was England . The most important factor which gave a sense of identity to the original inhabitants of this island ? Britons ? was the geographical contiguity . Around 1000 B.C. , the Celts of northern Europe invaded and conquered this island @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them and exacted tributes . The Romans again conquered this island and ruled her from the first century to the early fifth century A.D. When the barbarians invaded the Roman Empire , the Roman army was withdrawn from England . Then followed the invasions of Germanic , Angles , Saxons and Jutes who occupied a part of this island . During the late eighth and early ninth centuries the Danes , who were adventurous sea-faring men , attacked this island . Alfred the Great , the famous Anglo-Saxon king of England , was able to drive them out . After his death , England came under the rule of King Canute of Denmark . After Canute 's death , the Anglo-Saxons in England recovered their independence . But their independence proved to be shortlived as William , Duke of Normandy ( France ) invaded England in 1066 A.D. He defeated and killed the Saxon King , Harold , at Hastings and became the master of the island after two decades . In course of time the cultures of the two ? AngloSaxon and the Norman-French ? came to have harmonious blending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ordered the survey of all land-holdings in England for tax purpose which was recorded in the Domesday Book . His successors were weak , and in 1154 King Henry II ascended the English throne . Royal absolutism : Under King Henry II of England royal power increased by leaps and bounds and included the appointment of church officials . He established the common law appointed itinerant judges , and introduced the jury system . All these were done in order to protect the people of the land from tyrannical rulers . King Henry also made an attempt to gain // control over the faction-ridden Ireland and for that purpose sent his son , John . But John failed because his attitude alienated the sympathy of many chieftains there . Henry 's successor was Richard I ( the Lion-heart ) who remained mostly away from England because of his participation in the third crusade . In order to collect money from the people for the crusade he sold charters of freedom to many towns and cities . Eventually this innocent act paved the way not only for the self-government of the towns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Limitations on royal power : The next important phase in the development of British political culture was the evolution of parliament . When Richard I was away , his youngest brother declared himself the heir to the throne and later on imprisoned the king . He lost his valuable possessions in France and soon became extremely unpopular . It may be remembered that he was also excommunicated by Pope Innocent III . The nobles and barons rose in revolt and forced him to sign the Magna Carta in 1215 at Runnymede . This document secured for them the royal guarantee that their ancient rights and privileges would not he violated . It included ( a ) freedom from arbitrary arrest and confiscation of property , ( b ) trial by jury , and ( c ) levy of new taxes only with the consent of the Great Council . The importance of the Great Council which was to become parliament in the later days was recognised by King John . His successor was Henry III who was also a weak ruler . He became unpopular like his father after his intervention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forced him to sign the Provisions of Oxford . It was later followed by the imprisonment of the king in the Tower of London , and the leader of the nobles by the name Simon de Montfort convened the meeting of the Great Council in 1265 which included , among others , two knights from each shire and two citizens from each town . In the true sense this was the first Parliament England had ( 1265 ) . The next ruler was Edward I who needed money for the conquest of Wales and Scotland . So he required the support of all the four groups ? the nobles , clergy , townsmen , and representatives of shires ? for the imposition of new taxes . // Model Parliament ( 1295 ) : So he summoned what is now known as the Model Parliament in 1295 which also included representatives of the last two groups . He succeeded in conquering Wales but not Scotland . Scots under King Robert Bruce defeated the English at Bannockburn in 1314 and remained free for the next three centuries .

Soon after the conclusion of the Hundred Years War England witnessed a civil war . The House of York ( with its White Rose as its badge ) and the House of Lancaster ( with Red Rose as its badge ) claimed for itself the English throne . Therefore this civil war came to be known as the War of the Roses . This Thirty Years war ended in the victory of Henry the Tudor who belonged to the House of Lancaster . Tudor Rulers of England : With popular support King Henry VII suppressed the rebellious nobles and revived strong monarchy in England . He founded a special court called the Star Chamber which was used against the seditious barons . He lowered the expenses of the government and at the same time avoided waging of foreign wars . He encouraged England 's trade and commerce with Europe and laid the foundation of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her political and economic stability . His son and successor , King Henry VIII ( reign 1485-1509 ) led the Reformation movement by severing his connection with Rome ( see Chapter on Reformation ) . He founded the Anglican Church and became its champion . The British Parliament showed its subservience to royal interests and policies . The short reign of Edward VI witnessed the acceptance of Protestant doctrine by a majority of the English . His successor was Queen Mary who was a devout Catholic . She married an equally devout Catholic , King Philip of Spain , and tried to revive Catholicism in England . The persecutions of protestants and the execution of 300 of its leaders earned her the title " Bloody Mary " . Her successor , Queen Elizabeth I , avoided the extremes and established Anglicanism as the official religion of England .

Stuart rulers : After Elizabeth 's death , England came to be ruled by Stuart rulers . As the first Stuart ruler , James 1 ( 1605-1625 ) united the kingdoms of England and Scotland . He fancied himself to be the divine representative of God as often expressed in the Latin phrase , a deo rex , a rege Iex ( meaning " the king is from God , and the law from the King . " ) . His absolute despotism alienated the sympathies of the common people . His religious and foreign policies provoked the Puritans . A long dispute beween the king and the Parliament ensued . His son Charles the First ascended the throne in 1625 and made things worse by imprisoning the opposition members of the House of Commons for opposing him . However , the members of the Parliament asserted their position by forcing the king to accept the Petition of Right ( 1628 ) . Nevertheless , the bitter dispute between the king and the Parliament plunged the country into a civil war . It was fought between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roundheads ( supporters of the Parliament ) . Oliver Cromwell 's Irons/des finally defeated the royal forces at Marston Moor and Naseby . King Charles was taken captive and executed for treason in 1649 . Oliver Cromwell ruled as dictator of the newly formed Commonwealth of England until his death in 1658 . The Long Parliament invited Charles II , son of the executed Charles I , to return to England and rule as king . He treated the Puritans with contempt and drove them out of office . The Parliament tried to restrain his power by forcing him to sign the Habeas Corpus Act in 1679 which provided for the right of the accused to demand a trial in a court as to why he was being held in prison . The successor of Charles II was his brother James the Second . His short reign was marked by disputes between the king and the Parliament on the one hand and the king and the Anglicans on the other . When he baptised his newly born son in 1688 as a Catholic , the Parliament decided to invite the king @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , King of Holland ) , // to assume power in England . William and Mary accepted the invitation . James II fled , and England achieved the " Glorious Revolution " ( sometimes called the " bloodless revolution " ) in 1688 . Parliamentary control over the King and Queen was established after the Bill of Rights was passed . Some of the achievements of the " Glorious Revolution " included the end of absolute monarchy , the supremacy of the Parliament , the rise of the middle class and the establishment of a Protestant State . France With the disintegration of Charlemagne 's empire , France was split up into small kingdoms each ruled by a powerful noble . Feudalism took deep roots and therefore it took a long time before a strong monarchy could emerge . The powers of the central government began to increase gradually under King Hugh Capet and his successors . The most outstanding among them were Philip Augustus Louis IX , Philip IV and Louis XI . Philip Augustus ( 1180-1223 ) decided to augment his power at any cost . He found that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As a feudal chief , Philip called John who was his vassal of his court . But John did not oblige him , thereby providing an excuse for Philip to conquer most of the English possessions in France . Furthermore , Philip drove out the Alibigensians from Toulouse and gained control over it . King Louis IX extended his power over the nobles by various means and introduced currency and legal reforms . King Philip IV ( 1285-1314 ) augmented the royal power further by taxing the Church lands , forced the Pope to live in Avignon ( France ) and seized the properties of the knights Templar and called the first Estates General to support his policies and actions . During the time of Louis XI the whole of France except Brittany came under royal control and the nobles could hardly challenge the power of the king . France fared badly in the Hundred Years ' War with England on account of the series of defeats she suffered at the hands of the latter .

Her victories paved the way for the establishment of a strong monarchy in France under Charles VII ( 1430-61 ) who was crowned King of France at Reims Cathedral in 1430 . In the end Joan was captured by the English and accused of witchcraft in a Church court . She was declared a witch and burnt at the stake in 1430 . The French kings and soldiers were highly inspired by her great heroism and sacrifice . Nationaf feelings ran high and the French drove the English out of their country .

His Finance Minister , the Duke of Sully , averted a possible bankruptcy by introducing necessary reforms . Agriculture , textile industry and the manufacture of silks and linen were encouraged . France sent explorers in search of new lands . French settlements were established in Nova Scotia . Henry IV was succeeded by Louis XIII in 1610 . He was eight years old then but the entire task of administering Francefell upon the shoulders of the Prime Minister , Cardinal Richelieu .

French settlers established colonies in Northern America which were called New France ( Canada ) and Louisiana ( U.S.A ) . The British colonies ? in all thirteen in number ? sprang up on the eastern sea-coast of the present U.S.A. These British settlements were promoted by chartered companies and were approved by the British Crown . Jamestown in Virginia became the first British Settlement in 1607 . The main reasons for the people of Europe and British to emigrate were trade and religion . For example , the Jamestown settlement was started as a commercial venture by the Virginia Company . Religious enthusiasm of the Pilgrim Fathers who fled persecution in England was also responsible for the spread of a number of settlements . Fifty years after the foundation of Jamestown , the English established a number of colonies . Development of 13 English Colonies The Pilgrim Fathers came to America and established colonies ( in the New England area ) . They sought civil and religious autonomy from their mother-country and made the Mayflower compact as the basis of their new government . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the // rapid spread of tobacco and cotton cultivation . The landlords there were typical English Squires who employed slaves . The Quakers and Catholics developed Pennsylvania and Maryland colonies respectively . Pennsylvania was founded by William Penn ( a quaker ) where the residents were " free to worship as they pleased . " Lord Baltimore who set up the colony of Maryland exclusively for Catholics also allowed Protestants to settle there . The Dutch set up New Amsterdam as a trading post . When the English defeated the Dutch in 1664 and captured New Amsterdam they renamed it as New York . Part of the colony , of New York became New Jersey . The colony of Delaware was founded by a Swedish company and ultimately fell into the hands of the English . The colony of Connecticut was founded by some people of Massachusetts who desired more religious freedom and political voice than they were getting in their own colony . Men from Boston founded the colony of new Hampshire . With the exception of Connecticut and Rhode Island all other colonies had governors who were appointed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ council . Each colony had an assembly consisting of elected representatives who voted for local taxes and local laws . All the colonies required protection as the French across the northern border , and the Red Indians from the West , constantly posed a threat . The British governors could afford to give that protection to the natives of the thirteen colonies . By the middle of the eighteenth century the thirteen colonies had a population of about one and a half million . The natives of the 13 colonies had no reason to complain because their representatives voted to levy taxes without outside interference . British Mercantilist Policy When the colonies grew in size and importance , the British government felt keen on establishing control over them . Firstly , the British King appointed governors to rule over them . The salary of the Governor was to be borne by the colonial exchequer . Secondly , the British merchants were interested in deriving benefits from a policy which Britain was to adopt arbitrarily and implement it in her colonies in America . This Policy was called the mercantalist policy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Parliament which restricted the // scope of colonial exports and imports . For example , the colonists were made to sell their goods only to the English merchants and to buy foreign goods after paying duty at an English Port . Furthermore , the colonists were not to compete with the English manufacturers . Opposition to these mercantilist regulations were widespread and the colonists resorted to smuggling of goods . Taxes were also evaded by the colonists . Some of the merchants in the colonies maintained their trade contacts with the enemies of Britain . It was this measure of political and economic independence of the colonists which Britain sought to curb not for selfish reasons but out of dire economic compulsion . The change in English colonial policy took place in 1763 , that was after the Seven Years ' War ( 1756-63 ) in Europe . Britain finally achieved victory over France and her allies , and from the former she received Canada after signing the treaty of Paris . However , the long war strained her slender resources to such an extent that her government started imposing heavy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constraint that compelled her to change from the lenient policy she was pursuing towards her colonies to a somewhat stricter one . When the French lost Canada to Britain after the Seven Years ' War , the colonists heaved a sigh of relief . They no longer feared a French attack on their colonies . It was this change in the situation which gave them courage and self-confidence . They began to boldly articulate their views . However , the British government under King George III , was not prepared to give them a large measure of independence . On the other hand , the British government tried to exploit the colonies in order to save herself from a financial bankruptcy . Conflicting views arose when Britain tried to make good her financial deficit by resorting to taxing the colonies . It was argued that since Britain protected the colonies during the Seven Years ' War , she felt it justified that the colonies should share a part of the financial burden . But the colonists replied that the war on the continent had been fought and financed by them and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they argued that colonial assemblies alone had the right to tax them . // Enforcement of mercantilist regulations : King George III began to assert his position and forced the cabinet to secure parliamentary sanction for imposing new taxes on the colonists . The royal officials were ordered to strictly enforce the mercantilist trade regulations . For proper enforcement of trade regulations the British government sent troops to America . British agents were authorised to check smuggling and search private residences on suspicion . Britain also ordered settlers not to move beyond the traditional border on the western side lest it should provoke the Red Indians . This order made the fur traders and small farmers in the colonies angry . Businessmen also became disturbed as they hoped to buy western lands at a cheap price . Sugar Act ( 1764 ) : The British Parliament passed the Sugar Act in 1764 by which duty was imposed on molasses imported by the colonists . The colonists tried to smuggle molasses but their activities were curbed . There was considerable resentment since the tax was imposed by the British government . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towards meeting the expenses of British troops stationed in the colonies . Stamp Act ( 1765 ) and its repeal : During the next year , George Grenville ( the British Prime Minister ) , introduced a new measure , the Stamp Act , by which the colonists were required to register various legal documents , wills , and licences by affixing revenue stamps . The British Parliament gave its consent as the amount of revenue to be raised was not big , but the colonists reacted very strongly . They raised a storm of protest . Heaps of stamps and the effigies of stamp collectors were burnt , and there were riots in New England and New York . The Stamps Act Congress which was composed of the representatives of nine colonies met at New York and passed a resolution that British Parliament had no right to tax the colonies without their consent . The British government made a hasty retreat and repealed it . However , it insisted on its right to tax the colonies . On hearing that the Stamp Act had been repealed , mobs in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agitation was mainly directed not very much . against the revenue to be raised through the purchase of stamps // but on the right of the British government to tax them . Secondly , the agitation brought about the unity of all the nine colonies as apparent from the meeting of the Stamp Act Congress . Townshend Act ( 1767 ) The Grenville ministry yielded place to Pitt 's ministry . Its Chancellor of the Exchequer , Charles Townshend , proposed duties on colonial imports of glass , lead , paint , paper and tea . At the same time , he ordered the suspension of the New York Assembly for not enforcing the Mutiny Act of 1765 . The British Parliament gave consent to both these Acts . Besides a storm of protest , the merchants of Boston , Philadelphia and ' New York resorted to the boycott of British goods . It may be remembered that the non-importation agreement of colonial merchants , and the activities of the sons of liberty , compelled the English merchants to ask their government to repeal the Stamp Act earlier . Some colonial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to rely on Britain for imports . Townshend died and his place was taken by Lord North . To break the unity of the colonists , Lord North repealed all Townshend duties except on tea . The presence of the Customs Commissioners in Boston enraged Samuel Adams , the leader of the Boston mob . Their activities resulted in the firing at the mob which Samuel Adams termed as " Boston Massacre " . Boston Tea Party ( December 16 , 1773 ) : The tax on tea was retained for two reasons . Firstly , the British government wanted to retain its right to tax the colonies despite constant opposition from the colonies which raised slogans like " No taxation without representation , " and " taxation without representation is tyranny . " Secondly , Lord North tried to help the East India Company to dispose of its large stock of tea by selling them to the colonists . As usual there was popular opposition to this tea in move and leaders inthe colonies tried to prevent unloadling of the colonial ports . In Boston , Samuel Adams and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the East India Company ships and threw all the chests of tea into the water . The news of the Boston Tea Party ' spread and was repeated in many other ports . // King George III and his adviser , Lord North took retaliatory steps . By a series of acts they withdrew the charter granted to Massachusetts colony , put Boston harbour under quarantine , and banned political meetings there . Colonists accused of crimes were to be tried " in England . The Quebec Act was another coercive act aimed against the Protestants in the colonies . These colonists who were interested in western lands felt it as a serious obstacle to westward progress . More British troops were sent to Massachusetts . The First Continental Congress ( 1774 ) British retaliation roused the anger of the colonists . The colonial assembly of Virginia took the first step in issuing a call for a continental Congress to deal with the intolerable acts of the British government which endangered the liberties of every colony . Accordingly , the First Continental Congress met in September 1774 in Philadelphia . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some of them like George Washington , John and Samuel Adams , and John Jay who were to play an important role in the early history of the United States of America were taking part in the Congress . They sent a petition to King George 11I to redress their grievances , formed a " Continental Association " , with the purpose of stopping all trade with Britain , and agreed to meet again during the next spring . In Britain , Lord Chatham and Edmund Burke appealed to their government to repeal the coercive acts . But the government remained adamant . Skirmishes at Lexington and Concord lead to war : The First Continental Congress had approved steps to be taken to prepare for war . The people of Massachusetts gathered arms and ammunition and trained " minutemen " to fight . In Boston , British General Thomas Gage sent troops to capture ammunition stored by minutemen at Concord . When the troops arrived at Lexington , conflict ensued resulting in the death of minutemen . British troops advanced towards Concord and destroyed the ammunition dump . On its way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fired upon by the colonists . Tales of British atrocities spread and soon the war broke out . // Declaration of Independence ( 4th July 1776 ) : A few weeks after the battles of Lexington and Concord , the Second Continental Congress met in Philadelphia . The Congress , representing the delegates coming from all the colonies except Georgia , decided to support the war . They sent an olive branch petition and also adopted a declaration of the Causes and Necessity of Taking up Arms . ' In January 1776 , Thomas Paine 's pamphlet , Common Sense advocated independence for colonies from the corrupt British monarchy . Britain answered the olive branch petition with the Prohibitory Act which closed the colonies to international trade . The Second Continental Congress decided to break with the mother country by appointing a committee to draft a formal declaration of American Independence . Thomas Jefferson wrote the Declaration of Independence which was issued on 4th July , 1776 . It included , among other things , a list of omissions and commissions of the government of King George III , and " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Liberty , and the pursuit of Happiness . " In the end the solemn declaration mentioned , " we therefore ... solemnly publish and declare , that these United Colonies are , and of Right ought to be Free and Independent States .... " The War : The Second Continental Congress appointed General Washington as the commander of the Continental Army and began to raise necessary resources for the continuation of war . Washington commanded ill-equipped and poorly trained soldiers numbering 19,000 and was pitted against 32,000 trained British soldiers led by Sir William Howe . Howe defeated Washington at Long Island and captured New York . But Washington did not lose his courage . He recrossed the icy river of Delaware on a snowstorm Christmas night and captured Trenton from the Hessians . He followed up this victory with another at Princeton . The war entered a new phase when Lord George Germain accepted a plan to isolate the New England by sending a force of 8,000 soldiers under the command of General Burgoyne who was to come down from the Hudson Valley to New York to join Gen. Howe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was intended . Firstly , Burgoyne found it difficult to reach the South because of the difficult terrain and overburdened soldiers . Secondly , Gen. Howe left New York for the South not knowing // that he was to take his forces to meet Burgoyne . He went southwards , defeated Washington again in Brandywine creek and Germanstown and occupied Philadelphia . In the meanwhile , Gen. Burgoyne was defeated at the battle of Saratoga and finally surrendered in October 1777 . The defeat of the British at Saratoga proved to be a turning point in favour of the Colonists . The French Foreign Minister believed that the American colonists deserved assistance from a friendly country . So France joined the war on the American side in 1778 to help them in winning the war , and at the sane time derive satisfaction of avenging her defeat in the Seven Years War . France lent money and sent her volunteers to America . The French navy alsn played a decisive role during the crucial stages of the war . Soon Spain and the Netherlands were also at war with Britain as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russia , Denmark and Sweden ) assumed hostile attitude towards Britain . Thus , Britain was alone in her fight against the rebellious colonists who were thousands of miles away from her . Lack of communication and fresh reinforcements weakened the British army which had the problem of effectively controlling the territories it had conquered . In Britain'the Whigs condemned the attitude of King George III towards the colonies . General Washington spent the most bitter winter at Valley Forge . His army starved and its morale was very low . The British won several victories in the South in 1780 . But in 1781 , the // British army in the South led by General Cornwallis was surrounded by the American and the French armies . Unable to extricate himself from this predicament , Cornwallis with his soldiers surrendered to Washington at Yorktown . It was the most important event in the course of the war . The war continued till 1783 even though Britain was weary . Britain lost the war because her leaders were unable to direct it efficiently . Secondly , she had lost her supremacy on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was fighting on foreign soil which was thousands of miles away . Fourthly , her commanders committed many blunders . In the end , one mus talso give due credit to General Washington for having ably led the colonial forces to victory . Results of the war : In 1783 , the British signed the Treaty of Paris ( 1783 ) by which she recognised the independence of the 13 colonies . The treaty included the delimitation of territory ( " from the southern boundary of Canada to the northern boundary of Florida and from the Atlantic to the Mississippi " ) . One may say that the American War of Independence was an event of great importance in the history of mankind . The long struggle of the colonists against the royal tyranny ended . Ideals enshrined in the Declaration of Independence were put into practice . The Americans chose a Republic in the place of monarchy and built a truly democratic state . Thirdly , the American Revolution had its impact on the French who groaned under tyrannical monarchy . When the French volunteers led by General La Fayette @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of revolution on their native soil , thus , paving the way for the outbreak of the French Revolution in 1789 . King George III and his government stood very much discredited in the eyes of the people . Despite the advice given to King George I1I about following a policy of restraint towards the colonies , he remained adamant ( he was mentally deranged ) . So royal interference was kept at a low level henceforth . In the end , the mercantilist theory , that colonies exist for the benefit of the mother-country , came to be very much criticised . Britain changed her policies towards colonies considerably . // AND NAPOLEON BONAPARTE Political causes . Social causes . The First Estate ( the Church ) . The Second Estate ( the nobles ) .

Importance of Napoleonic era . Towards the closing years of the 18th century Europe was shaken by the French Revolution ? considered by many historians as the most important landmark in human history . The revolution which occurred in 1789 swept away the existing political institutions and aimed at establishing a more egalitarian society and responsible government than what existed before . The Revolution began with the siege of Bastille on July 14 , 1789 and continued until the rise of Napoleon Bonaparte to power . Let us examine the causes which led to the sudden overthrow of the French Monarchy in 1789 . Political Causes Royal absolutism , as witnessed during the glorious period of Louis XIV , carne to an end with his death in 1715 . His great-grandson , Louis XV , who ascended the throne at the tender age of five , neither had the capacity nor the ability to govern the country effectively . France drifted towards chaos by involving herself in numerous wars . Mindless of the financial burden that would fall upon the poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Seven Year 's War with the result that she lost her empire . Poor peasants who could not pay the taxes were sent to prison and those who spoke against royal despotism and tyranny also suffered . King Louis , // XV never evinced keen interest in governing the country but engaged himself in the pursuit of worldly pleasures . When his ministers tried to discuss with him the serious problems of the state , he said , " After me , the deluge . " He sadly neglected the affairs of the state and appointed his favourites to important offices . The treasury was empty after the wars , and the king remained , as usual indifferent . He also adopted a policy of repression by imposing curbs on the freedom of the press and speech . The king did little to alleviate the sufferings of the common people . Louis XV ' s successor was Louis ) ( VI . He was twenty years old when he came to power . He was intelligent and well intentioned . But he had no will to carry out some bold reforms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His judgement was influenced by flattering courtiers and his ill-advised queen , Marie Antoinette . Unfortunately , France had no uniform code of laws . A law which was regarded as just and fair in one province was not so in another . Nepotism and corrup-tion in every government depart ment further alienated the sympathies of the people . r The Bourbon monarchy dis-carded the practice of consulting the Estates-General on state matters since the days of Louis XIII.i They thought that it served little purpose . In the absence of the Estates-General , the kings of France arrogated powers for themselves but were advised by able chief ministers like Cardinal Richelieu Mazarin and finance ministers like Colbert . However , towards the end of the eighteenth century , the French monarch was not having such able ministers to guide the destiny of the country . Social Causes Invidious distinctions and unjust privileges marked the character of the French society . The society was divided THE FRENCH REVOLUTION AND NAPOLEON BONAPARTE 189 ; sharply into three estates or classes . The first estate was constituted by the higher clergy , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ church of France . The First Estate ( the Church ) : The Church owned one-fifth of the cultivated lands in France and enjoyed great influence with the Government . Like the nobles , the higher clergy was also exempt from paying most of the taxes . With the nobles they supported absolute monarchy . The Church collected tithe , a tax from the people for providing community services . It also maintained institutions of learning . The lower clergy lived in miserable conditions . The Second Estate ( the nobles ) : There were about 80,000 families in France who belonged to the nobility ? the second ' Estate . Even though feudalism disappeared in France since the days of Richelieu , these families continued to enjoy all the privileges such as non-payment of most of the taxes , avenues to higher positions in the French administration , and income from various feudal dues of the peasants . It may be noted that most of the nobles were absentee landlords . This idle aristocracy became a parasite and made peasants feel that they were paying taxes to them for their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : The bulk of the French population belonged to the third estate . They were the middle class members , the peasants and artisans . The educated , middle-class , which consisted of merchants , lawyers , teachers , doctors and others , was conscious of the inequalities in the social order and unfair and oppressive taxes resorted to by the despotic monarchy . The government hardly cared for their welfare . It was from them that the main thrust for the revolution . came . The peasants complained of overburdening taxes which reduced them to penury . After paying taxes to the landlord , the church and the state , a poor peasant could hardly make both . ends meet with 18 per cent of his income . He was further subjected to humiliation when the nobles destroyed his field . while hunting animals . The French artisans complained of the regulation of trade-guilds which favoured their masters and left , them with meagre income . ' 190 WORLD HISTORY Economic Causes The French system of taxation was both unjust and unfair despite the fact that peasants in the neighbouring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peasants suffered due to oppression of the tax-farmers and uncertain imposition of the taxes . The privileged classes did not pay most of the taxes and the burden was naturally shifted on to the shoulders of the poor peasants . Intellectual Awakening It is said that ideas govern the world and they come from the philosophers . France produced great philosophers during the eighteenth century . Voltaire became internationally famous as a great writer and critic whose style and pungent criticism were inimitable . It was through his plays and writings that he launched his bitter attacks against the existing institutions like the church and the state . He made fun of the eccentricities of the nobles . Writing about Voltaire ( 1694-1718 ) , Macaulay says , " Of all the intellectual weapons ever wielded by man the mockery of Voltaire was the most terrible " . While Voltaire would have liked enlightened despotism , Montesquieu ( 1659-1755 ) a good student of constitutional government , preferred constitutional monarchy in France such as the English type . He summed up his ideas of such a government in his important work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work that he popularised the theory of separation of powers and of its exercise by three branches of government ? the legislative , the executive , and the judiciary . If this is done , he argued there would be no tyranny and the liberty of the individual could be safeguarded . Probably the greatest French philosopher of the age was Jean Jacques Rousseau . In his Social Contract , he explained that the king and his subjects are parties to a contract , and therefore if the king does not rule the people according to their general will , be loses their loyalty . The people have every right to overthrow the monarchy under such circumstances . Rousseau was advocating popular sovereignty theory . His writings cast such a spell on his admirers that they were ready to revolt against the oppressive monarchy . Diderot was another // intellectual of the time who prepared an Encyclopaedia containing the latest knowledge . He exposed the rotten system of administration in France and suggested several remedial measures . The Role of the King When the American colonists revolted against the oppressive rule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Saratoga , the French government decided to help them with men , money and materials . It caused a serious strain on the finances of the country and cast a heavy burden on the poor peasants . After the success of the American Revolution ( 1783 ) , the French volunteers returned to their homeland and sowed the seeds of the revolution . The king ought to have reduced the expenses of the royal household and wisely dealt with the financial crisis . However , this was not to be because the queen and her advisers always came in his way . Turgot was appointed as the Minister of Finance to suggest remedies . He advised the king to tax the privileged class . He was summarily dismissed at the instance of the queen . The financial crisis reached threatening proportions and the government defaulted payment of salary to the armed forces . Unfortunately , France witnessed nearfamine conditions in 1788 with the result there was serious // food shortage . Coupled with this , there was unusual and severe winter in 1789 . It was at this critical juncture the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( French Parliament ) to get approval for further dose of taxation . Course of the Revolution : When the Estates-General was summoned , the king ignored the importance of the third-estate ( 600 representatives elected by the common people ) and tried to consult the representatives of the three estates separately . The representatives of the third estate advised the king to bring together the representatives of all the three estates at one place for discussion of state problems . The king discarded their advice . Subsequently , it led to a quarrel between the king and the representatives of the third estate . They , along with a few representatives from the other two estates , took a pledge ( Tennis court oath ) not to return home till the drafting of the new constitution was completed . The new constitution was to be framed to limit the powers of the king . When the king dismissed Turgot , rumour spread that he might dissolve the National Assembly also . It was then that an unruly mob in Paris stormed a medieval fortress ? prison of Bastille ( July @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ royal despotism . The Swiss guards were killed and a few political prisoners were set free . The royal power was weakened further when the revolutionaries drove out royal officials from Paris and established their own government there ( i.e. , the Paris commune ) . The king summoned troops to frighten the Paris mob . It led to further escalation of mob fury . Hungry women of Paris marched to the royal palace of Versailles and demanded bread . When there was no proper response , the mob entered the palace and ransacked it . They forced the king , the queen and their children to live in Paris . The National Assembly completed the drafting of the Constitution in 1791 . According to this new Constitution the King 's powers came to be drastically reduced . Laws were to be made by the Legislative Assembly , and members of this assembly were to be elected by tax-paying citizens . The king was not happy at the civil constitution of the clergy . However , he gave his consent to abide by the laws of the new Constitution . Looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the peasants rose in revolt against the nobles ) and also a possibility // of a war breaking out with Austria on the borders , the king thought it fit to flee the country . in June 1791 , he attempted to flee with his family but was apprehended at the border town of Varennes . Thus , ended the hopes of the Moderates who desired a constitutional monarchy . The Extremists gained ground in popularity and power . It led to the deposition of the king and his subsequent execution ( 1793 ) . France was fast drifting towards a war with her neighbours as their monarchs were shocked at the execution of King Louis XVI . A total anarchy prevailed with the new constitution being set aside . The National Convention which met in September , 1792 , began to draft a new constitution . It abolished monarchy and declared France a Republic . Then it established a committee of Public Safety which was headed by the extremist leaders like Danton and Robespierre . These leaders enjoyed unlimited authority . The Girondins who were moderates were executed and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . France witnessed the guillotining of thousands of nobles and innocent men who had supported monarchy . Among the famous women who were executed were Queen Marie Antoinette and Madame du Barry , Constitution of 1795 After the death of Robespierre , the moderate elements gained predominance in the National Convention . The National Convention framed a new constitution for France in 1795 according to which the executive powers were vested with the Directory composed of five persons who were to be advised by a legislative body consisting of two chambers . When there was royalist uprising in Paris against the new constitution , troops were ordered to crush it . A Corsican youth named Napoleon Bonaparte took charge of the command , and after a whiff of grape-shot ' dispersed the unruly mob which was about to attack the National Convention . This young officer was destined to rule France from 1799 to 1815 . Results of the revolution : During its ten-year course the French Revolution brought about far-reaching changes . Firstly , it destroyed the vestiges of feudalism and liberated the serfs . Secondly , it established @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . The declaration of the // Rights of Man came to be included in the new Constitution as an article of faith . The nobles and the Church lost their property and their lands were distributed to the peasants . Slaves in the French colonies were set free . The watchwords of the French Revolution such as Liberty , Equality and Fraternity reflected the coming of a new democratic and social order in Europe . Thirdly , the revolution roused national feelings . The common people were prepared to die for the sake of protecting the gains of the revolution . The French Citizen-militia fought the enemies , on the French borders . Finally , the French Revolution had a lasting effect on the people of Europe in the 19th century . Those who were groaning under the tyranny of foreign rulers , derived their inspiration from the French . Europe was convulsed by frequent revolutions . aimed at overthrowing oppressive governments . In the ensuing chapters one learns about the way in which the Italians and Germans overthrew the oppressive regime of Austria and achieved unity . Napoleon Bonaparte @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1769 . His parents were Italians and he spoke French with a foreign accent . He attended military schools at Brienne and in Paris . Children of French nobles who attended these schools treated him with contempt since he belonged to a poor family . When he was sixteen Napoleon joined the French army . When the revolution broke out he supported the Jacobins . When the British attacked Toulon , Napoleon went to its rescue and succeeded in driving them out . He was arrested after the fall of Robespierre and sent to prison . He would have been guillotined but for a quirk of fate . He impressed the directorate with his timely and effective action against the royalist mob which threatened to attack the National convention . He rose high in his career because he knew one of the Directors , Barras . Another Director by the name Carnot was very much impressed by Napoleon 's military ability that he appointed Napoleon as the commander of the Italian expedition . // He found his soldiers ill-fed , ill-equipped and lacking morale and courage . Despite these handicaps . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them into highly disciplined soldiers . He gave them a sense of purpose . By a brilliant master-stroke of stratagem he drove the Austrians out of Southern Italy . His brilliant victories against the Austrians compelled the Austrian Emperor to , sue for peace . Dazzled by his brilliant victories , theDirectorate asked him to undertake the task of defeating Britain , an ally of Austria . Napoleon convinced the Directorate that Britain could be subdued only if her economy was throttled . For this it was necessary to attack Egypt . The French army under Napoleon set sail for Egypt and the Egyptians were defeated in the battle of Pyramids.y However , Napoleon received a serious setback when Lord Nelon destroyed the French fleet at Aboukir Bay in the battle of Nile . Leaving his army in the lurch , Napoleon made a secret exit and returned to France . He received a hero 's welcome and he blamed the Directorate for his failure . After overthrowing the Directorate following a coup ( 1799 ) , Napoleon declared that France would be governed by the Consulate ( 1799-1801 ) consisting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later Consul for life . The French gave their consent to all these acts of Napoleon because they found at last a man who could give France political stability . France was threatend by another coalition of European powers with Britain and Austria at the forefront . Napoleon swiftly responded to the situation . He compelled the Czar of Russia to withdraw from this coalition . He struck at the Austrians in Italy and defeated them . Britain sued for peace ? the peace of Amiens in I F02. // This peace gave enough respite to Napoleon to turn his attention to the domestic problems of France . Napoleon established numerous satellite republics in Italy , Germany and Belgium . He obtained Louisiana territory in Northern America from Spain as a compensation for the loss of Canada after the seven years war . Riding on the crest of a wave of popularity he became the Consul for life . After that he became the Emperor of France and the Pope attended the coronation ceremony to perform the ritual . Napoleonic Wars Napoleon 's ambition was to unite the countries of Europeand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eager to bring about his downfall . So , the brief respite ended and the war between France and powers of European coalition continued from 1803 . Napoleon planned to make a direct attack on Britain and started organising a powerful fleet for this purpose . However he changed his mind . He attacked Austria and captured Vienna . He brought about the end of the Holy Roman Empire and himself became the king of Italy . He routed the combined armies of Austria and Russia in that splendid battle of Austerlitz which marked the climax of his career . Britain under the leadership of Prime Minister William Pitt gave up her attempt to contain Napoleonic supremacy over Europe . By 1810 Napoleon had reached the apogee of his glory . Russia turned into his ally after the treaty of Tilsit . Napoleon appointed his brothers as kings . Louis became the king of Holland ; Joseph , king of Naples and Jerome , king of Westphalia . Napoleon divorced Josephine since she could not give him a son and married Marie Louis , daughter of the Emperor of Austria . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the continental system ? through his Berlin and Milan decrees ? to compel Britain to acknowledge his leadership . However , he had gone too far . Britain retaliated by issuing Orders in Council to force nations of Europe not to obey Napoleon . Russia broke her alliance with France and Spain revolted .

At the head of a large army ( consisting of 600,000 soldiers ) he marched right up to Moscow to find it totally deserted . The Russians followed the scorched-earth policy towards the invader . To make things worse , the Russian winter set in . Starvation and severe cold destroyed the bulk of Napoleon 's army and he made a hasty retreat . Napoleon 's enemies took full advantage of this debacle . In the meanwhile , the Spanish revolted and received assistance of the English troops led by the Duke of Wellington .

He declared himself as the Emperor of France and determined to meet his enemies on the battlefield . The final battle was fought in 1815 at Waterloo , a few miles away from Brussels . It ended the career of Napoleon . The allies condemned him to exile , and he spent the rest of his days as a prisoner of the British in the island of St. Helena . He passed away in 1821 .

The Code , simple in its form , was the work of a genius and it touched every aspect of French life . Subsequently , it served as a model for other Europeon countries . The code reflected the aspirations of the French who wanted to build a new society . Along with the Napoleonic Code , two other codes , namely , the criminal and commercial were introduced to bring about social and economic stability . Concordat : Ever since the promulgation of the Civil Constitution of the Clergy , the relations between France and the Vatican had undergone severe strain . Napoleon perceived that much of rural folk in France were staunchly Catholic . Therefore , he felt that he would win their sympathy if he established friendly relations with the Pope . He made friendly overtures to the Vatican and got encouraging response . Negotiations with the Pope ended in a treaty called the Concordat .

Bank of France ( 1800 ) : It may be remembered that France had been plagued by a serious economic crisis since the outbreak of the revolution in 1789 . It was Napoleon 's desire to , tackle this serious problem on the one hand and to secure the // support of the prosperous middle-class for his wars on the other which led to the founding of a National Bank in France . Taxes were levied on the basis of one 's ability to pay . Corruption was put down to a great extent . But during the last few years of his career as French Emperor he frequently resorted to levying indirect taxes to sustain the wars he was waging . Public Works : Napoleon paid great attention to public works . He granted funds on a liberal scale for undertaking public Works . He personally evinced keen interest in the beautification of great cities such as Paris .

New Educational System : The educational system in France also received its due attention from the Emperor . He devised a new system to discipline the young minds to serve the goals he himself set for , in order to glorify the state . He weaned the schools away from the church control . He founded public schools which paid attention to the development of mind and body . Napoleon founded the Imperial University in 1808 to meet the growing demands of young scholars . He also founded an Academy of Science to encourage scientific pursuits . He took pride in attracting scholars and scientists to some of the academies he had opened . He encouraged scholars to study the ancient history of Egypt soon after his Egyptian campaigns .

Centralisation of French Administration : The most important reform of Napoleon was to reorganise the system of // administration . The characteristic feature of his reform in this field was centralisation . He appointed all the officers of the state and also the prefects in the provinces and gave some autonomy to the city municipalities . All the officers of the provinces and at the centre were appointed on the basis of their loyalty to the Emperor , moral integrity and efficiency . From the above it is evident that Napoleon , coupled with his personal ambition . tried to consolidate the achievements of the revolution .

It may be remembered that Napoleon had indirectly brought about the unification of Germany and Italy by creating several satellite republics in them . But when he started his engine of oppression , they started revolting . So it may be said that Napoleon was defeated by the very forces ? spirit of nationalism and democracy ? which he created . Napoleon tried to build a United States of Europe with France as its leader . He sought to achieve this by his spectacular military exploits . It was he who founded the idea of militarism and modern diplomacy in the nineteenth century . It was not until the rise of Bismarck that a strong military state like Germany was to play an important role in the history of modern Europe .

So when Napoleon conquered Italy , the Italians began to regard him as a liberator . But when his oppressive rule started , they began to detest him .

The principle of legitimacy was applied and Italy came to be divided . The Pope received his papal states . The king of Sardinia got back his kingdom consisting of Piedmont and the island of Sardinia . The Spanish king recovered the kingdom of the two Sicilies ( i.e. , Naples and Sicily ) . Austria annexed Lombardy and Venetia to her empire . Small duchies in northern and central Italy were revived and
