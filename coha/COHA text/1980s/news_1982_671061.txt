Mr. Bush then worked closely with James A. Baker 3d and Michael K. Deaver , the White House chief of staff and deputy chief of staff , to have President Reagan meet with black officials at the White House . The advice of Mr. Bush , in turn , helped lead to Mr. Reagan ' s decision to seek legislation to reverse his original position. // For more than 13 months , Mr. Bush has served the President in public as cheerleader , occasional director of study groups and liaison agent with organized labor and other disaffected groups . But civil rights , according to knowledgeable officials , is only one of many areas in which Mr. Bush has played a much more influential role behind the scenes as confidant to Mr. Reagan. // // ' Voodoo ' Line Keeps Returning // Mr. Bush ' s staff winces when only his gaffes seem to become news . For example , he denied recently that he had ever used the term " voodoo economics " to describe Mr. Reagan ' s policies . After a television network found a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Vice President said the denial had been voiced in jest. // In private , Mr. Bush has experienced what some people close to him would describe as frustrations . Two aides resigned recently , in part because they had too little to do . The Vice President is known to have been disappointed at his failure , as a high-level expert on regulations , to effect an early Administration position revising the Clean Air Act while retaining the support of pro-environmental Republicans in Congress. // Yet by all accounts , Mr. Bush is happy in his job . He feels he has succeeded at the one task he sought most : to serve as an influential adviser without posing a political threat to Mr. Reagan. // " The President looks at George Bush as somewhat different from his other advisers or friends , " said Mr. Deaver . " Sometimes he worries that one or the other of us may have an ax to grind or show some prejudice . He prizes George for his loyalty , sincerity and objectivity . " <> <> Influence Can ' t Be Paraded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his role has contributed to the influence he enjoys . " It ' s a funny role , because you can ' t make it into something it ' s not , " he said in a recent interview . " You shouldn ' t worry about whether other people understand . I don ' t spend any time worrying about it . If somebody comes to me and says , ' Well , prove you ' ve got influence , give me some examples of where you ' ve got influence , ' I ' m very sorry - I can ' t do it. // " If the price of that is obscurity , or anonymity or allegations that you don ' t have any clout , fine , " he went on . " But I want enough confidence from the President so I can go in and say , ' I feel very strongly about this , Mr. President , ' or ' I agree on this , sir , ' or ' I disagree on that . ' And he ' d know he could discuss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wouldn ' t discuss it with his staff , my staff , the press , my family or anyone else. " // Mr. Bush is so careful in this regard that he almost never speaks up in Cabinet meetings , lest his views be disclosed to the news media . He reserves advice for his weekly lunches with Mr. Reagan . White House aides have speculated that it is there , for instance , that he has advised the President about heeding Republican protests in Congress on the Federal deficit . <> <> Conservatives Remain Suspicious // Aides to Mr. Bush , who campaigned hard against Mr. Reagan in 1980 , say further that he remains especially sensitive to conservative fears that he may have too much influence over Administration policy . As a Reagan aide acknowledges , " The right wing needs a whipping boy , and Bush is convenient. " // Some of Mr. Bush ' s problems with the conservatives are based on his conscious effort to be an Administration ambassador to hostile political forces . For example , he is reported to have argued strongly that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaders so as to gain potential support for its foreign policy. // Mr. Bush got involved in the controversy over tax exemptions for racially discriminatory schools , officials said , because of his belief that revitalizing the Republican Party must include efforts to enlist support from blacks. // The White House " salvage operation " on the tax-exemption issue culminated Thursday when the Administration asked the Supreme Court to decide whether racially discriminatory private schools are entitled to tax exemptions . <> <> Public and Private Efforts // Last year Mr. Bush spoke at the commencements of four black colleges and conferred with black leaders and entertainers . A few months ago , without publicity , he spent part of a weekend afternoon at the home of a young diplomat from the Cameroon who had had a cross burned on the lawn of his house in Silver Spring , Md. , a Washington suburb. // Yet on the Voting Rights Act , according to White House officials , Mr. Bush and others were overruled by Mr. Reagan when they made the argument for a simple Presidential statement endorsing the act ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have bowed to the wishes of his Attorney General , William French Smith , in endorsing weakening changes in the House bill. // A more successful instance of Mr. Bush ' s influence came in November , when the President ' s inner circle was in turmoil over whether to dismiss David A. Stockman as budget director. // At a meeting called to discuss the matter , White House officials said , Mr. Bush showed up at the Oval Office with a well-marked copy of a damaging Atlantic Monthly article about Mr. Stockman . He also brought clarifying advice. // First , reviewing passage after passage in the article , Mr. Bush demonstrated that , more than the others , he had read and analyzed what Mr. Stockman had actually said , the officials said. // Then , acknowledging the existence of grounds for dismissing Mr. Stockman , he urged Mr. Reagan to " act fairly " and grant a reprieve if the President felt he could personally trust the budget director to carry out the Administration program . After talking with Mr. Stockman , Mr. Reagan took Mr. Bush ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Stockman dismissed . <> <> Planned Auto Restrictions // In foreign policy , when the Administration was debating its response to imports of Japanese automobiles , Mr. Bush suggested approaching the Japanese through Ambassador Mike Mansfield to seek voluntary restrictions on that nation ' s exports . His approach was adopted. // It was Mr. Bush who studied the nation ' s options on Poland and urged Mr. Reagan to adopt a policy of sanctions against both Poland and the Soviet Union , followed by tougher action if the Polish crackdown was not eased . The Vice President undertook this task as chairman of the Special Situation Group , which handles " crisis management " for the President. // The Vice President was also reportedly one of the stronger proponents in the Administration of selling Awacs airplanes and other air warfare equipment to Saudi Arabia . Early last fall , he told the President of his fears that unless Mr. Reagan intervened the sale would be defeated in the Senate . Mr. Bush then supplemented Mr. Reagan ' s efforts with his own energetic lobbying. // Again , as chairman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mr. Bush is reported to have pushed for a consensus or a decision on numerous matters . At one meeting , according to a participant , he directed Labor Secretary Raymond J. Donovan to " do some more homework " before the panel took action on a job safety regulation Mr. Donovan was advocating . <> <> Intervened for Latin Refugees // A few weeks ago , in another instance of Mr. Bush ' s willingness to intervene in Cabinet matters , he telephoned Richard S. Schweiker , the Secretary of Health and Human Services , to seek a delay in a cutoff of welfare and health benefits for Haitian and Cuban refugees . The delay was granted ; Mr. Bush announced it in Miami on a visit there as chairman of a study group on crime in South Florida. // More than anything else , however , Mr. Bush endeared himself to the White House last March 30 in the moments after Mr. Reagan was shot in the chest and in the weeks when the President was recovering. // Returning from a political trip in Texas , Mr. Bush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the White House South Lawn in his helicopter . He also declined to sit in the President ' s chair while presiding over Cabinet meetings in Mr. Reagan ' s absence. // " He had a perfect touch , " said a Reagan loyalist . " In the moments after the shooting , you know that the situation was not exactly harmonious among some of the rest of the people in the Administration . But Bush came through like a star. " // On Capitol Hill , where Mr. Bush has the official task of presiding over the Senate , the Vice President is well-liked . He is also used extensively as a sounding board and go-between for both Republicans and Democrats . But several knowledgeable aides and legislators said that his role has been secondary in the lobbying for key legislation . In the Senate he defers carefully to Howard H. Baker Jr. , the majority leader . <> <> More at Ease With House Members // Mr. Bush , who lost in a race for the Senate in 1970 , is said to feel more comfortable among his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to play paddle ball once a week in the House gym , and he is besieged there by members with messages to pass on to the White House or favors to ask . He responds , listening and taking notes. // " Sometimes I know he ' s gone to the President when he ' s had concerns , " said Representative G.V. ( Sonny ) Montgomery , a Texas Democrat who is one of Mr. Bush ' s paddle ball partners . " But I ' ve never heard him say anything uncomplimentary about the President. " // Mr. Bush has had problems bringing his own staff into the thick of things . Although he gets a copy of every piece of paper Mr. Reagan receives , his staff does not attend every White House meeting on relations with Congress. // Nor was there a representative of the Vice President present earlier this month when 16 aides to the President huddled at Camp David , Md. , for a strategy session on long-term Administration public relations . <> <> Two Aides Sought More to Do // As a result , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resigned , because , according to one aide , " they didn ' t have enough to do . " The aides who left , Richard N. Bond , former deputy chief of staff , and Robert V. Thompson , chief Congressional liaison , were also said by others to have been involved in disagreements with Jennifer Fitzgerald , who handles the Vice Presidential scheduling. // The Vice President ' s staff acknowledges that Mr. Bush has been embarrassed over some gaffes . Among them was his enthusiastic toast last June at the inauguration of President Ferdinand E. Marcos of the Philippines , a nation Mr. Marcos has ruled under martial law for more than a decade . In that toast , he spoke of the " love " Americans have for " your adherence to democratic principles and to the democratic processes. " // But the biggest flap of his time in office , according to leading aides , occurred when the Vice President handled preparations for the economic summit conference in Ottawa last July. // Mr. Bush was widely praised at the White House for assembling briefing materials for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some Presidential aides were incensed that the State Department negotiated a working draft of the summit communique without their being told about it by Mr. Bush. // Others were reportedly upset that the Vice President had not been careful in meshing his own preparations with the White House system of paper flow before the summit . A Bush aide called the Ottawa preparations " an innocent bust , " and maintained that they led to better coordination between the Presidential and Vice-Presidential staffs . <> <> Broad Experience Respected // Mr. Bush is said to command Mr. Reagan ' s respect on foreign policy matters because of his past experience as Director of Central Intelligence and as American delegate to the United Nations and Ambassador to China . He has taken five overseas trips as Vice President , three of them to Latin America. // As chairman of the Special Situation Group , Mr. Bush has presided over meetings on three crises in addition to the one on Poland . One of these was said by aides to have covered a situation that has not yet become public. // The Vice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are reconciled to two things : First , that he will never be the favorite of the Republican right wing , and , second , that the public will not forget that in 1980 he denounced Mr. Reagan ' s prescriptions as " voodoo economics. " // " It comes up every time , yet again , " Mr. Bush said wearily the other day . " It ' ll never go away . " But whatever misgivings he may once have had about the Reagan economic program , Mr. Bush is one of its most enthusiastic defenders now. // He lobbied hard in Congress last summer for the full Reagan tax cut , the very thing he had criticized in the 1980 campaign as potentially inflationary . More recently , Mr. Bush has publicly stated his faith in the tax cut , despite moves by some Republicans to rescind or defer portions of it . <> <> Sought Support of Labor // After a recent meeting with A.F.L.-C . I.O. executives in Miami , Mr. Bush recounted with relish how he had opened up the session by telling the leaders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , ' Let ' s get the gripes out of the way first , ' " he recalled in an interview . " Then I went into areas where they should support us - Clean Air Act , certain objectives on foreign policy . I said , ' I haven ' t heard you guys on this whole allegation that El Salvador is Vietnam . ' I said , ' For God ' s sake , look at Vietnam today ! You want that in Salvador ? Come on , let ' s go , we need your help ! ' " // " I loved it , " said Mr. Bush , sounding as if he had emerged from the lion ' s den . " It was good , good stuff . " Whether he wants it or not , Mr. Bush is also constantly aware , his aides acknowledge , that he is being tested in this job for a possible future run for the Presidency. // A Congressman who is a close friend of Mr. Bush and asked not to be identified said he put the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Just what are Mr. Bush ' s political intentions ? The Congressman said Mr. Bush replied firmly that he expected Mr. Reagan to run for re-election , and that he could not afford now to make political plans. // Nevertheless , Mr. Bush has spoken in the last year at countless political affairs , raising $3. 5 million for Republican Party candidates . He has also helped the party raise another $5. 5 million through direct mail appeals . <> <> Proud of Administration Role // He is certain to try to cash in on his tireless work for local Republicans should he run for President in 1984 or 1988 , as most aides expect him to do. // As for whether Mr. Bush is happy in his work , his friends say that he has found genuine fulfillment . " He sees himself as playing the greatest role he ' s ever played , " said Victor Gold , Mr. Bush ' s former speechwriter. // " George was very nervous about what kinds of problems he was going to have as Vice President , " said another friend of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ competitive , and Reagan does not insist on George doing anything he doesn ' t want to do. " // But even those closest to him agree that if Mr. Bush were experiencing frustrations , he would keep them to himself . Not even the President is said to be sure that Mr. Bush ' s highly disciplined style as " team player " doesn ' t mask disappointments nursed in private. // At a Kennedy Center event last fall , for example , Mr. Reagan endeared himself forever to Mr. Bush and his wife , Barbara , and left Mrs. Bush close to tears , when he drew Mrs. Bush aside and said , according to a friend , " I want to ask you a very serious question : Is George happy ? If he isn ' t , I want you to tell me. " //
