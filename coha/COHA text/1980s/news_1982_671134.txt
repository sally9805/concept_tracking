LIKE the major characters in most of Eric Rohmer ' s comedies , Sabine ( Beatrice Romand ) , the heroine of Mr. Rohmer ' s new " Le Beau Mariage , " seems almost ordinary at first . She is pretty in a fresh but unspectacular way , articulate and seemingly well adjusted to a kind of enlightened middle-class existence. // Part of the week Sabine works in an antique shop in Le Mans , where she lives with her younger sister and widowed mother , and the rest of the week she is in Paris , where she is studying - half-heartedly - for a degree in art history and carrying on a casual affair with a married painter named Simon. // One night as she and Simon are making love in his apartment , the telephone rings . The call is from his children , who are reporting , probably at their mother ' s suggestion , on some recent accomplishment , which the father attends to with patient pleasure . Sabine gets out of bed , dresses quickly and , when she finally has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not for the night but for good. // By way of explanation she tells him she is getting married . To whom ? Sabine says she doesn ' t know . She hasn ' t yet met the man , but she has no doubt that she soon will . Sabine is fed up with a life of freedom and understanding. // This is more or less the jumping-off place for " Le Beau Mariage " ( translated into English as " The Well-Made Marriage " ) , one of Mr. Rohmer ' s most charming and , in some ways , most compact comedies . The film reduces the relations between the sexes in 20th-century Western civilization to the dimensions of Sabine ' s single-minded pursuit of Mr. Right in Le Mans and Paris and back again . Sabine might at first appear to be ordinary , but it soon becomes apparent that her ordinariness disguises a woman of quite extraordinary emotional tenacity and moral conviction. // Sabine is alternately sweet and ferocious as she puts into effect her plan to convince Edmond ( Andre Dussollier ) , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are made for each other , or at least as made for each other as any two people ever are - Sabine is a pragmatist . Edmond is at first amused and then alarmed. // One of the consistent rewards of Mr. Rohmer ' s films ( " My Night at Maud ' s , " " Claire ' s Knee , " " Perceval , " among others ) is that his characters never behave in ways made predictable by the second-rate fiction of others . Under any other circumstances Sabine would probably be intolerable in the way she dogs the trail of poor Edmond and refuses to take his lack of telephone calls as a sign of indifference , which , of course , it is. // Sabine is neither stupid nor arrogant . She is , rather , totally convinced of the utter reasonableness of what she ' s about . It ' s this reason , sometimes misapplied , that forever separates her - and other Rohmer characters - from the people who turn up in far more conventional romantic comedies. // Mr. Rohmer is one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , people whose thought processes are in some fashion demonstrated and not solely defined by the music they listen to or the books they say they have read . Unlike " My Night at Maud ' s " and " Claire ' s Knee , " there is little such namedropping going on here . Sabine is certainly not an intellectual , but she is a remarkably self-aware , engaging woman with a no-nonsense approach to her life. // There is a revealing , very funny sequence in which Sabine runs into Claude , the first man she ever loved , a fellow who is now a teacher and happily married to another teacher , and goes back to his apartment with him . For a few moments it seems as if they might make love , for old times , but they immediately become embroiled in an argument about Sabine ' s militantly proclaimed desire to get married and become a housewife. // The news astonishes Claude . What about her career ? Does she want to become a hearth slave , ever dependent on her husband ? What will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for each of his questions and , moreover , makes them sound convincing. // The scope of " Le Beau Mariage " is limited , but everything within it is well-defined and magically , unexpectedly , illuminating . One has the feeling - rare in commercial films - of having met romantic characters who in no way deny the social and political complexities of the real world that exists just outside the view of the camera. // Miss Romand , who made her screen debut as the precocious teen-ager in " Claire ' s Knee , " has grown into immensely appealing womanhood and is a comedienne of the first order . Prominent in the excellent supporting cast is Arielle Dombasle as Clarisse , Sabine ' s best friend , a wise beauty , who watches Sabine with a mixture of concern and amusement ; Mr. Dussollier as the beseiged Edmond , and Thamila Mezbah as Sabine ' s mother , who is shocked when she hears her daughter talking about chastity in terms that she , the mother , considers a hundred years out of date. // " Le Beau @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is a witty , halcyon entertainment , especially in a season that has otherwise been notable mostly for extravagant overstatement and special effects. // " Le Beau Mariage , " which has been rated PG ( " parental guidance suggested " ) , includes some partial nudity and one mildly suggestive sexual sequence . <> <> Looking for Mr. Right <> <> LE BEAU MARIAGE , directed and written ( in French with English subtitles ) by Eric Rohmer ; cinematography , Bernard Lutic , Romain Wind- ing , Nicolas Brunet ; edited by Cecile Decugis and Lisa Heredia ; music by Ronan Girre and Simon des Innocents ; produced by Margaret Menegoz and Les Films du Losange and Les Films du Carrosse ; released by United Artists Classics .
