Ever since Israel 's birth as a nation in 1948 , the Israel Defense Forces have enjoyed a position of uncommon esteem both in the country and beyond . David Ben-Gurion once remarked that the I.D.F. was perhaps his nation 's most successful achievement . The London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies this year rated the Israeli military as the fourth most powerful in the world . Yet today , in the wake of the Beirut massacre , many among the I.D.F. 's 172,000 regulars and 504,000 reservists are deeply demoralized . <P> That rising tide of anger and frustration is directed primarily at one man : Defense Minister Ariel Sharon , a general and hero of the 1973 October War . Simply put , the soldiers are afraid that he will make the I.D.F. a scapegoat for the Beirut massacre . Brigadier General Amram Mitzna , head of the I.D.F. 's Staff and Command College , announced two weeks ago that he was requesting a leave of absence in protest over the killings . ( He has since relented . ) Mitzna bluntly told Sharon , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Israeli officers , including everyone above the rank of brigadier general , met behind closed doors with Chief of Staff Rafael Eitan on Sept. 24 to complain about Sharon . A group of reservists opposed to the Lebanon invasion addressed a petition to Sharon last week signed by 1,000 of them , including 150 officers , asking not to be sent to Lebanon . <P> Sharon has fanned suspicion that he is trying to evade responsibility for the massacre . During the Knesset debate two weeks ago on whether to conduct an official inquiry , the Defense Minister hinted that when the opposition Labor Party was in power in 1976 Israeli officers took part in a massacre of Palestinians by Lebanese Christians at the Tel Zaatar refugee camp near Beirut . Sharon clearly was sniping at Labor Party Leader Shimon Peres , who was then Defense Minister , and not at the army , but I.D.F. officers familiar with the matter issued angry denials . <P> Sharon then said on Israeli television that he had decided not to call up a reserve brigade during the Lebanon invasion because he was afraid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's effectiveness . Members of the brigade denounced the charge and pointed out that they had indeed been summoned to the front . <P> Even before the Beirut massacre , many Israeli soldiers felt that the I.D.F. was beginning to forget its middle name . For the past 15 years , the I.D.F. has been mainly an army of occupation , with thousands of troops tied down in the restive West Bank , Gaza Strip and Golan Heights . Israeli soldiers last April were forced to perform the anguishing task of evicting Jewish settlers from the northern Sinai town of Yamit as part of the 1979 Israeli-Egyptian peace treaty . When Israeli tanks rolled into Lebanon last June , many soldiers expected that campaign to last only a few days . Four months later , with 335 Israeli troops dead and 2,000 injured , many in the invasion force are questioning the utility of that mission . As one enlisted man in Beirut put it last week , " What are we doing here ? We have no business being involved with these people . It 's time to go home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
