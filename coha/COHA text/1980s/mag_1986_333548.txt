When a small plane strayed into restricted airspace over Los Angeles Airport and slammed into an Aeromexico jetliner last August , killing more than 80 people , the Federal Aviation Administration decided to make the skies less friendly for private-plane operators . Last week the FAA issued recommendations that include a minimum 60-day license suspension for any pilot violating the boundaries of the terminal control area above the nation 's 23 busiest airports . <P> Private aircraft entering the TCAs must be equipped with transponders that automatically report altitude to the control tower ; only about half of all private planes are currently outfitted with such devices . Edmund Pinto , senior vice president of the 260,000-member Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association , said that " the whole system wo n't work unless the control system is modernized . " Currently , a $12 billion plan to upgrade the nation 's air- traffic operations is two years behind schedule .
