THE ROAD WARRIOR Directed by George Miller <P> Screenplay by Terry Hayes and George Miller , with Brian Hannant <P> THE VERMIN HAVE INHERITED THE EARTH . So proclaims the spray-painted graffito on a truck sprawled by a desolate stretch of road in this low-budget Australian thriller . At first horrified glance , moviegoers may be convinced that the vermin have also inherited the movie industry . In The Road Warrior , cars crash , somersault , explode , get squashed under the wheels of semis . Skinless bug-eyed corpses hurtle toward the screen . A mangy dog sups at a coyote carcass . A deadly boomerang shears off fingertips , creases a man 's skull . That 's entertainment ? As a series of isolated incidents , no ; our nerve endings have long since been numbed by the movies ' aimless carnage . But as garishly precise daubs in George Miller 's apocalyptic fresco , they add up to exhilarating entertainment-and a textbook for sophisticated , popular moviemaking . <P> Like its predecessor Mad Max ( 1979 ) , The Road Warrior is set in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a white-line junkyard ; the only amenity is staying alive . Where there was high culture , now there is only car culture . In one of the film 's first images , an automobile breaks angrily through one side of the truck that has been holding it ; this is the caesarean birth of the new mutant marauders . They race across the scarred landscape on stripped-down motorcycles , killing for fuel , raping for fun , going to hell at 80 m.p.h . In a jerry-built fortress , the more admirable survivors have assembled an oil refinery-but , surrounded by the marauders , they can not escape to use their precious petrol . Into this version of cattlemen vs. homesteaders rides a scurvy Shane : Max ( Mel Gibson ) , once the leader of a vengeful highway patrol , now a misanthropic me-firster . For the technical challenge , Max makes an uneasy pact with the refiners . He will help them break through the cordon of marauders and speed them toward their image of paradise : the seacoast , 200 miles away , and peaceful freedom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aftershock . Bikers have terrorized many a decent citizen in movies over the past three decades . And the sociopathic superman has emerged to defend them in distinguished westerns ( John Ford 's The Searchers ) and easterns ( Akira Kurosawa 's Yojimbo ) . What Miller has done here is create a milieu as dense and tangy as Tolkien 's Middle Earth or Cline 's demimonde . This is Australia as the Down Underworld , where character is revealed in the gradations between good and awful . Drawn in vivid cartoon strokes , this menagerie can be funny or heroic or scary .
