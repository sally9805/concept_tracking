There is a Bible for every taste , or lack thereof : Bibles bound in denim and hand-tooled leather , translations in street slang , Bible comic books , Bible cartoon videos and seventy times seven other gimmicky editions . Now , for the parson who has everything , here comes the ultimate in modern packaging : the Electronic Bible . This is not a new translation but a hand-held computer containing the entire scriptural text in either the King James or the Revised Standard Version . The item , manufactured by New Jersey-based Franklin Computer , will go on sale in selected retail outlets next week . Price : $299 . <P> Weighing 13 oz. , measuring 5 1/2 in. square and powered by four AA batteries , the microchip Bible is more portable than most published editions . By punching in book , chapter and verse , the user can immediately call up any of the 31,173 verses of Scripture on the screen 's four display lines . From there the text can be read continuously , backward or forward . <P> But its other search @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Want to find every place in the Bible where " taxes " appears ? Just punch in the word and sit back . The computer displays all the books where the exact word is found , and a simple added command then brings each text to the screen . Taxes turn up but once in the King James , in Daniel 11 : 20 . A handy extension of this feature can also search for all variant forms , such as taxed or taxation ( there are eight in all ) . <P> Or try this : type in a request to find any place in the Bible where the words valley , shadow and death occur in the same verse . The machine will obligingly display Psalm 23 : 4 . Ca n't recall the exact words ? A built-in thesaurus lets the user search through synonyms . The machine also provides - pronunciations for proper names ( Enoch is EE-nuck ) . A handicap for some will be difficulty in reading the enhanced liquid-crystal display , whose resolution is still inferior to that of larger , more expensive personal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bible will soon have to compete with a similar product developed by the SelecTronics company of Minneapolis . The SelecTronics Bible , also priced at $299 , will contain the New International Version that is favored by conservative Evangelicals . Why the scramble to break into the microchip-Bible market ? According to II Timothy 3 : 16 , " All Scripture is given by inspiration of God and is profitable " for believers . Obviously , computer companies are also hoping to turn a profit from Holy Writ .
