For 13 years the U.S. has assessed human rights abuses around the world . But never has a friend figured as prominently as one has this year , when twelve pages of the State Department 's survey were devoted to the " substantial increase in human rights violations " by Israel in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip . The report sketched a picture of excessive force by the Israeli army , resulting in " many avoidable deaths , " against the Palestinian uprising . This account of shootings , beatings , imprisonment and deportation is the most critical U.S. review ever of Israeli actions in the territories . <P> Israeli officials condemned the report as " harsh " and " one-sided , " but did not dispute the particulars . Instead they argued that the U.S. had ignored the " constant provocations " by " extremist elements . " Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir charged that the " media exaggerate " and said that " the behavior of our army is equal to that of any other army in the Western world .
