The trial of the President 's pal <P> Hand in hand , smiling and seemingly without a care in the world , Bert and LaBelle Lance last week strode into the Richard Russell Federal Building in Atlanta . They headed for the gold-upholstered ceremonial courtroom on the 23rd floor , site of the most unpleasant event in Lance 's go-go career . His long awaited trial for violating U.S. banking laws was about to begin , and he professed to be eager to get started . Said Lance : " We 're ready to move ahead . " <P> One of President Carter 's closest friends , Lance served as Director of the Office of Management and Budget until he was forced to resign in September 1977 . Three of his associates are on trial with him : Thomas M. Mitchell , a member of the Georgia state transportation board ; H. Jackson Mullins , a former pharmacist ; and Richard T. Carr , a onetime Georgia bank president . The four defendants are charged with a variety of illegal acts in obtaining more than $20 million in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York , Hong Kong and Luxembourg . According to the indictment , they made false entries in bank records , misapplied funds , willfully overvalued property and conspired to gain unwarranted extensions of credit . <P> The first week of the trial was devoted to selecting a panel of 56 jurors and alternates , a painstakingly slow process . By week 's end 53 had been chosen . All had been required to answer 70 written inquiries about their education , employment , health-even their hobbies and reading habits . In court , Edwin J. Tomko , a member of the Justice Department 's fraud section , asked each potential juror in a high-pitched voice whether he or she had seen or heard any accounts of the case , formed an opinion or read LaBelle 's book This Too Shall Pass . In a silky Southern voice , Defense Attorney Nickolas P. Chilivis asked jury candidates if they had had satisfactory or unsatisfactory experiences with banks , if they had ever applied for a loan , if they had ever had an overdraft . Asked whether she had heard anything about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replied , " I 'm sure we all have unless we 've been out of the country . " <P> Jury selection was so prolonged that Tomko joked , " At this rate , my newborn daughter will be in first grade by the time we begin . " And in graduate school before they end . Together the two sides may call between 150 and 200 witnesses before the case goes to the jury and the fate of Jimmy Carter 's old friend is decided .
