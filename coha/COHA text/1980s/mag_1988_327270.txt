After years of neglect , American workingwomen have rediscovered their nails . From second-story shops in New York City to brightly painted storefronts in Los Angeles , quick-service nail salons are springing up faster than fresh- vegetable stands . Customers get a lot more these days than a soak and a dunk . A typical visit includes a choice of manicures ( French , oil or glue ) , a hand massage and acrylic sculpting to strengthen and lengthen the nails . Prices range from $5 for the basic treatment to $50 or more for an extensive job .
