The advantage to being a fanatic is that everybody remembers you for your obsession . The disadvantage is that nobody remembers you for much else . Nearly three-quarters of a century after his death , in 1912 , Johan August Strindberg looms large in the public consciousness as the theater 's greatest misogynist , a man who never met a woman he could n't hate . <P> The bleakest of Swedes did , in fact , think of women as " whores , " including his three wives . In brilliant but vitriolic plays like Miss Julie ( an aristocrat lusts after her servant ) and Creditors ( hell in the shape of a triangle ) , Strindberg practices his own advice to other authors on the treatment of female characters : " Accuse them , blacken them ; abuse them so that they have n't a clean spot  --  that is dramatic ! " His second wife , Frida , an Austrian journalist , compared marriage to Strindberg to " a death ride over crackling ice and bottomless depths . " There is little evidence that his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his third wife , Harriet , a Norwegian actress , would have disagreed . <P> But to begin and end with this cartoon of frothing male vituperation does nothing to reveal how a Strindberg play can still electrify an audience in 1985 , or to explain why writers as different as Kafka and Camus , Thomas Mann and Jean-Paul Sartre have read Strindberg with admiration bordering on reverence . <P> Biographer Michael Meyer , accustomed to tamer Scandinavians ( as in his 1971 Ibsen : A Biography ) , fails to address the fearful Strindberg paradox as forthrightly as he might . He is long on description , short and cautious on analysis . But in the process of collecting data from Strindberg 's life and from some 75 volumes ' worth of plays , novels , stories , poems , essays , diaries and letters , Meyer scatters all the fascinating and self-contradictory clues a reader could ask for . Strindberg emerges as the most deceptive of fanatics . He was " slim and elegant , " fastidious in his dress and aristocratic in his bearing , with a " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being " afraid of the dark , " as well as of " dogs , horses , strangers . " He did not lack that rarest trait of the possessed , a sense of humor . He loved Dickens . He translated Mark Twain . When the mood was upon him , possibly after a few absinthes , he strummed his guitar while standing on one leg . <P> For a single-minded writer , Strindberg 's interests were strangely diverse . In addition to being the most prolific of authors  --  throwing his pages to the floor as fast as they flowed from his pen  --  he was a painter of considerable skill . Before he came to the theater , by way of walk-on parts at the Royal Theater of Stockholm , he studied medicine . Dabbling in alchemy , he attempted to produce gold by mixing copper and iron sulfate . Languages enchanted him . He applied himself to Chinese and Japanese , and although he remained violently anti-Semitic , he decided in middle age to learn Hebrew . <P> For a decade Strindberg lived in exile ( Paris @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he lived as a kind of pilgrim , tracking down every cracked new theory , pursuing every wild whim in the desperate hope that it might lead to the Truth . As an early modern , caught in the whirlwind and helping to agitate it , he understood that he inhabited " an age of transition "  --  at one moment " split and vacillating , " at the next moment " urgently hysterical .
