The Massachusetts State Labor Council let everyone know this week its feeling on Proposition 2 1/2 : It is against it . The Council also made known its feelings on the upcoming Presidential election : It is for Jimmy Carter . Having done this , the delegates have accomplished only the easy part . If the council wants to implement its resolutions , it has to get out and ring door bells , visit the plant gates and translate its intentions into political reality . This was the message Secretary of Labor Ray Marshall and Sen. Paul E. Tsongas delivered . The late president of the AFL-CIO , George Meany , was a political realist . He knew that organized labor could never match industry dollar for dollar in political campaigns . He also knew and admitted that just because labor endorsed either a principle or a candidate that didn ' t necessarily spell success . " The only thing we have that is unbeatable is manpower , " he often said , " and to let the rank-and-file know what a candidate stands for . " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must do if they wish to back up their resolutions - use their manpower and let the workers know what the candidates stand for . It was no accident that President Jimmy Carter sent Marshall to the convention . He was the " warm-up man " for Carter ' s visit here next week . Marshall ' s presence and speech was also to warn Massachusetts labor that a vote for Anderson was a vote for Reagan . This is the message that the Carter-Mondale campaign wants delivered to rank-and-filers in the labor movement . And the reason they want it delivered is that they are scared to death of John Anderson taking Massachusetts ' electoral votes away from Jimmy Carter . For the next four weeks the Carter campaign committee will be concentrating on labor in the northeast industrial states . To lose those states to either Anderson or Reagan means sending Jimmy Carter back to his peanut farm . On the tax-cutting proposal know as Proposition 2 1/2 , the convention emphasized what it believed it would mean in terms of job loss to the public employees . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It might be nice for someone in Dover , but it would devastate our cities , " he said . Tsongas found himself in a peculiar situation speaking to the convention . This is the same labor organization that did everything in its power to defeat him when he opposed former Sen. Edward Brooke , a Republican . In his introduction of Tsongas , Arthur Osborn , president of the Council , said : " He is a man who is almost always for the working person . " There never were such qualifications when it came to introducing Brooke . He had a perfect labor voting record in the Senate . Not quite perfect with Tsongas . Yet , for a politician who supported Sen. Ted Kennedy against Jimmy Carter in the presidential primaries , Tsongas went all out for Carter as well as giving a different perspective as to why labor should defeat Proposition 2 1/ 2 . Now if Massachusetts labor , having made known its positions , can rally the rank-and-file , it may dispell the notion in some circles that it has become a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ challenge yet to the new regime of officers , who ran on a platform of " let ' s get Massachusetts labor moving . "
