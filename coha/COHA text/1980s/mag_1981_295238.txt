The Presidency <P> It is always unwise for a President to get hypnotized by the world 's complaints about the way he conducts business . Nudging a great nation into a new course pinches a lot of people . Likewise , the Chief Executive who reads the domestic polls every night for political guidance is apt to be paralyzed each morning . The leader who views every White House catfight as apocalyptic will be a nervous wreck in his first year . Ronald Reagan is not guilty on any count . <P> But a President who ignores those distant rumbles and internal mutterings and fails to take corrective action can find himself in peril . It is a delicate time for the Reagan presidency . <P> Those abroad and at home protesting the nuclear-arms race have a genuine concern . The Israeli anxiety following the U.S. decision to sell Saudi Arabia the AW ACS planes and support systems is real . The Soviets are not as familiar as American moviegoers with the charm and warmth of the man in the White House . Careless and casual talk about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a corporate board member or main street merchant who still believes that Reagan 's original concept of how to treat the economy can achieve the results desired , he wisely remains mute . <P> The economic indexes tell us that Reaganomics at this time , in this particular mix , is not the full answer . <P> The periodic eruptions of Secretary of State Alexander Haig against back-corridor White House grousing over his performance are , if nothing else , enervating and diverting . Budget Chief David Stockman 's unusual excursion into journalistic confession raises a credibility cloud that may be no bigger than a man 's hand but capable of yielding acid rain . <P> There probably is no danger , as some gleeful Democrats would have it , that Reagan last week consigned himself to being " a ten-month President . " But there are memories of how small and not-so-small ineptitudes can accumulate , until one day the balance unexpectedly tips against a man . Lyndon Johnson through budget deficits and Viet Nam setbacks was forgiven a host of petty exaggerations , but he ultimately was standing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carter 's competence hardened the day he embraced his troubled friend and Budget Director , Bert Lance . Carter 's presidency was never quite the same after that . <P> The Reagan Administration talks too much . True , the pressure from the press has grown immensely in the past few years , but there is no law requiring compliance . There has been built-in competition between the Secretary of State and the National Security Adviser in the White House since the days of John Kennedy . That conflict needs to be resolved structurally so that there is a clear voice , an established authority . The substance of David Stockman 's confessionals was hardly spectacular . Professional economic critics had predicted it . Amateurs had sensed it and Reagan just a fortnight ago finally admitted it . Beneath the disappointment and embarrassment , however , lurks opportunity . Few successful programs emerge as Presidents plan them . Reagan stands at a point of departure , offered the chance to build a new scheme on some solid budget and tax gains and discard some failed notions . A vital presidency is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
