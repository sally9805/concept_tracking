Twenty years to the month after Rudolf Nureyev , star of the famed Kirov Ballet in Leningrad , defected from the Soviet Union , Mr. Godunov , a former star of the Bolshoi Ballet who had himself defected under the most dramatic circumstances , was sitting in a midtown Manhattan office . He had just been asked if he would ever consider returning to his native country to dance. // " Well , if I could leave again afterward , " he said , hesitatingly . Then , with a smile , he shook his head and added , " No , it would be impossible. " // Mr. Nureyev ' s defection , at Paris ' s Le Bourget Airport on June 17 , 1961 , was the first in a series of headline-making departures by Russian dancers who were seeking greater personal and artistic freedom , and perhaps greater riches , in the West . They were : // * Natalia Makarova , who in 1970 defected from the Kirov in London. // * Mikhail Baryshnikov , another Kirov star , who defected in Toronto in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who , after a long campaign on their behalf by artists in the West , were allowed to emigrate to Israel in 1974. // * Alexander Godunov , the first major defector from Moscow ' s Bolshoi Ballet , who was given asylum while the troupe was performing at Lincoln Center in August 1979 . This was followed by a tense diplomatic tug-of-war involving Mr. Godunov ' s ballerina wife , Lyudmilla Vlasova , and Soviet and American authorities . She was finally allowed to go , and was given a heroine ' s welcome upon her return to Moscow . Mr. Godunov has not seen her since. // * Leonid and Valentina Koslov , who defected from the Bolshoi on the final stop of the company ' s American tour , in Los Angeles , three weeks after the Godunov affair. // There have been other Soviet dancers who have left in the years since Mr. Nureyev , among them Alexander Filipov , Alexander Minz , Vladimir Davidoff , Yuri Stepanov ( who later " redefected " to Russia ) , and Elena Tchernishova . And there were , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though the term used in those days had much less of a Cold War ring to it . When George Balanchine left in 1924 it was known as emigrating. // Since leaving the Soviet Union most of these dancers have , as one might expect of stars in any of the performing arts , gone their separate ways , although professional commitments occasionally bring them in touch with one another . Mr. Godunov and Miss Makarova , for instance , perform with the American Ballet Theater , which Mr. Baryshnikov directs . Mr. Nureyev danced in Valery Panov ' s 1979 Berlin Ballet production of " The Idiot " that was brought to New York last year and briefly with Mr. Baryshnikov earlier this year at a gala benefit for Paul Taylor. // Otherwise , the contact among them is sporadic and infrequent . The closest thing to a regular get-together any of them have occurs each Easter , when Mr. Baryshnikov and Mr. Balanchine worship together at a Russian Orthodox church in Manhattan and then join a small group of friends for a traditional Russian meal at Mr. Balanchine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never will be , part of a ' Russian community ' , " said Mr. Baryshnikov during a recent backstage interview at the Metropolitan Opera House . " Most of my friends are American. " // " After work , Valery might want to eat some Russian food , " said Galina Panov over the telephone from Berlin , where she and her husband are preparing for the first performance this weekend of Mr. Panov ' s ballet based on " War and Peace . " " As for Russian dancers , " she added with a laugh , " he sees enough of them at rehearsal. " // If indeed it was a yearning for greater liberty to perform that compelled these dancers to leave their country , their families and friends , they seem to have found it in their new lives . Mr. Baryshnikov and Mr. Nureyev have become bona fide superstars who have even appeared in films ; Mr. Baryshnikov in " The Turning Point " and Mr. Nureyev in " Valentino . " Mr. Godunov would like to be in movies , too , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and American tours this summer. // The Panovs were not allowed to perform at all during their last two years in the Soviet Union , and , in fact , Valery Panov , who changed his name from Shulman , spent time in a Soviet prison . In the frantic months immediately after gaining their freedom the couple were booked into cavernous sports arenas here in the United States . Nowadays they maintain attachments to ballet companies in Berlin , Vienna and Zurich , leaving them little free time to spend at their home in Jerusalem. // Leonid and Valentina Koslov haven ' t seen much of their 80-year-old house in Englewood , N.J. lately , either . In the past year they have danced in such far-flung locales as Santiago , Chile , and Sydney and Melbourne , where they are now guest principal artists with the Australian Ballet . The couple made their Manhattan debut last November , dancing Alvin Ailey ' s " The River , " at the City Center with the International Ballet of Caracas. // Valery Panov is Jewish and he and his wife struggled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Panovs say , they miss very little of what they left behind . For some of the others , however , the act of defection was more impulsive and seems to have left an occasional residue of nostalgia . Alexander Godunov ' s athletic style of dancing and Prince Valiant looks made him a great favorite of younger audiences in Russia , and now when he speaks of his partnership with Maya Plisetskaya , the Bolshoi ' s prima ballerina , he looks wistful . " I would like to dance with her again , " he said . " She was great , and for six or seven years we had a very nice relationship on stage. " // Mr. Godunov says he misses his wife , whom he talks to about twice a month , and whom he doubts he will see again . " About a year ago , the authorities said that maybe she would be allowed to visit me , but then the political situation got worse and it never happened , " he said. // Mr. Nureyev , now appearing with the London Festival @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Metropolitan Opera with the Scala Ballet in two weeks , declined to be interviewed by telephone , but his feelings about three of his family members that he left behind are well known . For years , he has been trying to arrange visas for his 77-year-old mother , Farida Nureyeva , his sister and his niece , to visit him . In 1977 , Mr. Nureyev made an emotional appeal for help to the United States Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe , where he was accorded a sympathetic hearing . His relatives , however , have still not been allowed out of the Soviet Union. // When Mikhail Baryshnikov thinks of the country he left , his recollections usually are of Leningrad , a city he describes as " unreplaceable. " // " It is still very fresh in my mind , " he said . " Street corners , the tone of voices , smells , silhouettes , the River Neva at a certain time of day . It ' s very schmaltzy , but it ' s what I feel most strongly . It has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is nostalgia for a habit that has been broken. " // Would he like to dance again in Leningrad ? " I would love to go there more than anything else , to dance a couple of performances and then fly back , " he said . Since her defection , Natalia Makarova has been married , to San Francisco industrialist Edward Karkar , and borne a son , Andrusha , now 3 years old . " I try not to think about going back , " she said . " It ' s impossible , so why think about it ? " // Miss Makarova ' s chief concern is for her mother . They speak to one another monthly and Miss Makarova is anxious for her mother to see her son . " I have sent a photograph , " she said , " but she is dying to see him . He is her first grandchild. " // George Balanchine , who still refers to Leningrad as St. Petersburg , has been back to the Soviet Union ; in 1962 and again a decade later he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as cultural exchanges between the two countries . Mr. Balanchine didn ' t enjoy them , he says , and wouldn ' t want to repeat them ; he considered them an imposition . " The audiences for most of the performances were party functionaries , not the regular public , " he recalled. // Still , Mr. Balanchine , who has been with the City Ballet since 1948 , shakes his head at the suggestion that his early training still exerts an influence on him . " It would be like asking someone who is 75 years old and who went to Columbia University as a young man whether Columbia still influences him , " he said . " I don ' t think so. // " As for me , " he went on , " I have been in this country for more than 40 years . I was there for 20 . I am much more American than Russian . I ' ve done jazz , I ' ve done Broadway . In the sense that as a choreographer I must be able to do things technically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then I suppose you could say the early things I learned still play a part in my work . But it does not go beyond that. " // Had Mr. Baryshnikov , or any of the others for that matter , not defected , they would almost certainly still be involved in dancing , but few of them believe that they would be the same dancers they are today. // " My whole base as a dancer is there , at the Kirov , " said Miss Makarova , " but here I have tried to develop it , to work in a more concentrated way . I think that if I were still at the Kirov , I would be bored , so I might have 10 children ! That is why I am here. " // Mr. Baryshnikov says he is " absolutely a different dancer today " and credits the change to not only the various choreographers he has worked with in the past seven years but also to his exposure to other art forms . " Movies , musicals , photo exhibitions , we never had access @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said , " and they have all had a tremendous effect on my dancing. " // If he were still in the Soviet Union , Mr. Baryshnikov says , " I think I would be broken mentally by now , but I am sure I would have adapted , like so many people there do . Life goes on and you go with it , you try to express yourself as best you can. // " You know , " he added , " for years with the Kirov I was a very happy man . I loved the company , I had a very romantic view of it . But after a while , when I had traveled outside the country , I was able to look at it with more dispassion , and I realized I just couldn ' t be a part of it anymore. " //
