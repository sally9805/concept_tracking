THE AWAKENING Directed by Mike Newell Screenplay by Allan Scott , Chris Bryant and Clive Exton <P> At the tomb site a professor and his assistant ( Charlton Heston and Susannah York ) are prizing open the evil princess 's mummy case . Back in camp his wife ( Jill Townsend ) goes into labor-two months early . A mysteriously difficult birth ensues . No one needs a translation of the hieroglyphics in the burial place to know what is happening-the soul of the royal personage is reversing the usual journey , moving from tomb to womb . <P> When the professor 's daughter turns 18 , she answers a mysterious call of the blood and flies to her father 's side in London . There , estranged from the child 's mother-he was always digging up stuff instead of tending to her wifely needs-he has latched on to Co-Finder York . Never was there such an absent-minded professor , or one so absently played . To make a long story unbearable , mysterious unpleasantnesses begin occurring as soon as father and daughter are reunited , and most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colorfully slain . <P> Unfortunately , there is very little suspense between the death scenes , and far more exposition of the obvious than anyone needs . Horror , as a genre , has lately become the province of functionaries who disregard such niceties as motivations , explanations and , for the most part , production values . It seems significant that The Awakening 's only credible performer is young Stephanie Zimbalist , who throws herself zestfully into the part of a girl mysteriously possessed , but gamely fighting her lethal impulses . All others look badly in need of alarm clocks . Audiences will share that need . <P> - Richard Schickel
