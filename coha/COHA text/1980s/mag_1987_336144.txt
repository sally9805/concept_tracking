Next week in Miami , Pope John Paul II begins a ten-day visit to the U.S. , the 36th major journey by this most peripatetic of Roman Catholic Pontiffs . He has worshiped with exotically clad Papuans and has preached to hundreds of thousands in Marxist Managua . But though he has been to the U.S. three times / previously  --  as Pope in 1979 and twice before that as Archbishop of Cracow in Poland  --  he has not encountered anything anywhere quite so complex and independent as today 's American Catholic . <P> A few weeks ago , even as the daunting logistics for his tour were being fine-tuned , an adult Bible class met at the red brick Our Lady of the Assumption school in Claremont , Calif . The 25 participants quickly fell into heated disagreement over two issues : Is it morally licit for couples to live together outside of marriage ? Should the church approve the remarriage of divorced parishioners ? A generation ago , members of such a group would not have challenged the church 's no to both questions . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nurse , " Everybody had a different opinion . That 's the state of American Catholicism today . People are practicing what they want to practice , and priests are giving individual advice . " <P> Lee Kimball 's feisty Bible study group typifies the dramatic shifts that have taken place in U.S. Catholicism since the Second Vatican Council ended in 1965 . The stereotype of the working-class ethnic Catholic is no more . Catholics today are having smaller families , earning higher incomes and becoming better educated than Protestants . And their attitudes toward their religion have changed along with their circumstances . Once regarded by Rome as among the most dutiful sons and daughters of the church , many American Catholics now believe they have a right to pick and choose the elements of their faith , ignoring teachings of the church they disagree with . Nonetheless , more than in most Western nations where dissent is widespread , American Catholics continue to be committed to the church , though increasingly on their own terms . <P> The independent ways of American Catholics present a challenge that the resolute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean that he will necessarily arrive with tongue lashing and finger wagging . As with his dramatic 1979 U.S. visit , John Paul 's Sept. 10-19 journey will feature blessings and warm homilies to huge and friendly crowds ( see following story ) . But this time he will rely far more on advice from American bishops , who conferred with him in Rome , and he is expected to avoid confrontational speeches . The trip , through the Sunbelt and California to Detroit , will acknowledge U.S. cultural pluralism and deal with a few political necessities as well . <P> In Miami , the day after arriving and being greeted by President Reagan , he will confer with national Jewish leaders . Jews were upset by the Pope 's audience with Austrian President Kurt Waldheim , who has been accused of complicity in Nazi war crimes . John Paul attempted to mollify ill feelings with a letter expressing sorrow over the Holocaust , and will continue the fence mending at a Vatican meeting this week with Jewish officials . In Columbia , S.C. , on Sept. 11 , he will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ churches , then join an ecumenical prayer service with 72,000 people . In Los Angeles , the Pope will greet representatives of Islam , Hinduism , Buddhism and Judaism .
