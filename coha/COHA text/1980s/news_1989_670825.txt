But Aquilino Ramos savors his good fortune in migrating to Los Angeles from rural Mexico . Mr. Ramos , the 24-year-old son of a farmer , shares a shabby house with nine other people in the largely Hispanic Pico-Union area , getting by with help from his brothers , odd jobs and collecting aluminum cans . He has few complaints about Los Angeles , where he has learned English , gained a high school diploma and received thousands of dollars in free medical care for the juvenile arthritis that crippled him. // For Mrs. Taggart , sunny Los Angeles is a Southern California dream gone sour ; for Mr. Ramos , it is a dream come true. // // Big Changes , Big Growth // These perceptions underscore powerful social and economic changes sweeping the nation ' s second largest greater metropolitan area , after New York . Many middle-class whites are abandoning the region to those who can afford $500 , 000 or more for ordinary homes , to impoverished , unskilled Hispanic immigrants , to poor blacks for the most part left out of the surging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The exodus of white middle-class residents began at least a decade ago . The most recent study of it , by the Southern California Association of Governments , found that from 1975 to 1980 - if foreign immigrants are excluded - more people moved out of the area than moved in . But recent alarm over smog , gang violence , traffic , and housing costs appears to have accelerated the trend. // The result , some experts say , is that the six counties centering on the city are becoming a land of rich and poor , with few people in between - like a third-world country . The trend is apparent in New York and other cities , as well. // The economy of Los Angeles , now the nation ' s largest manufacturing center , booms on , but many economists say it is built on unhealthy demographic underpinnings : unskilled laborers , many of whom do not speak English , willing to do menial work for low pay . <> <> Two Different Worlds // " Two cultures are growing up totally diametrically opposed to each other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shulman , an economist formerly with the University of California at Los Angeles Business Forecasting Project and now director of real estate research for Salomon Brothers Inc. in New York . Mr. Shulman recently turned pessimistic about Los Angeles , saying he foresees a substantial " correction " in real estate values as more people and companies find a " West Coast life style at half the price of L.A. " in cities like Sacramento , Portland and Seattle. // But others are optimistic , among them Joel Kotkin , co-author of " The Third Century " ( Crown Publishers , 1988 ) , a book that says Los Angeles is the city of the future . Comparing its entrepreneurial economy to that of turn-of-the-century New York , he said Los Angeles was benefiting from immigrants and the small industries they create. // " In L.A. the future looks exciting and interesting ; we are riding a wave , " he said , adding that replacement of middle-class whites with immigrants , particularly Asians , is a boon . " If it was good for New York in 1910 , why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <> <> Immigrants Spur Growth // But fewer and fewer Angelenos share Mr. Kotkin ' s unabashed optimism . In this decade , according to calculations by the Southern California government group , 2. 8 million people will have moved to other parts of California and other states while only 2. 7 million will have moved in from other states . But the loss is more than offset by 1. 2 million immigrants , about 500 , 000 of them illegal , plus growth from births exceeding deaths. // The association ' s researchers project that from 1990 to 2010 , this emigration will continue , with a net loss of 700 , 000 , again offset by 2. 1 million immigrants , and the region ' s population will surpass New York ' s , reaching 18. 3 million in 2010 . It was 14 million in January. // These projections assume that a new law meant to stem illegal immigration by imposing sanctions on companies that employ the aliens will have no effect . If that proves true , non-Hispanic whites will soon become a minority and Hispanic people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up from 14 percent in 1970 . Asians and others will reach 9 percent , up from 3 percent . <> <> Moving In and Out // The study by the regional government group conducted from 1975 to 1980 found that while New Yorkers and other Easterners were still moving to Los Angeles , more Angelenos were moving to other Western states and other parts of California . They were more likely to be white and older than the general population ; 40 percent moved back to their original states . " There did not seem to be any clear economic reason , " said James Minuto , who conducted the research . " Maybe they came here for a certain thing and did not find it . So they go deeper in the West or go home. " // They are being replaced in part by Asian immigrants , an " urban renovation task force , " in the words of Gary Wehrle , president of Foothill Thrift and Loan , which lends money to South Korean immigrants , who run grocery stores , liquor stores , gas stations and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leading garment center. // Richard Kim is a 31-year-old Korean whose family came to Los Angeles with $2 , 000 . His parents took janitorial and gardening jobs and have now built a thriving sewing contracting company , Apple Tree Fashion . He has bought and renovated a building where Koreatown blends into the barrio ; he employs 170 people , almost all Mexican and Central American immigrants , who stitch together pants for big manufacturers. // Standing amid the whirr and clicks of sewing machines , Mr. Kim , issuing orders in Spanish , said he was proud to have created so many jobs . " We are trying to be competitive with Hong Kong and Taiwan , " he said . <> <> A Success Secret : Hard Work // Monica Yi was a nurse and make-up artist , and she now owns two restaurants , employing Mexicans and Salvadorans as dishwashers and kitchen helpers . She and her husband , Sam , a real estate broker , own a big sailboat . The Korean secret for success , she said , is " hard work . " Didn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " // Aquilino Ramos , the Mexican immigrant , has found a measure of personal if not great economic success . Crippled by juvenile arthritis , he first came to America in a wheelchair and illegally overstayed his visa , but he has been granted amnesty under the new immigration law. // While here , he underwent six operations that allowed him to walk , even to dance . Recently he was a graduation speaker at the E. Manfred Evans Community Adult School , where he learned English . He plans to start college courses in psychology and math in September. // Also at the school is Edbi Carranza , a 27-year-old Guatemalan , who is a mechanic ' s helper . He never had work in Guatemala . " This city gives a lot of opportunity to work if you really want to work , " he said. // Most Hispanic immigrants here live in deplorable conditions , some crowded into garages . While some have started businesses , their ability to make the leap into the middle class is much less apparent than the Asians ' . <> <> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the U.C.L.A. Research Group on the Los Angeles Economy found a " widening divide " between the rich and the unskilled poor as a result of inferior urban schools and immigrants with little education . " Unfortunately , prosperity has not benefited everyone , " the group ' s report said . " Inequality and poverty in Los Angeles are greater today than two decades ago . " The researchers found that the number of native-born and immigration people from Latin America living below the poverty line had grown to 25 percent from 17 percent over the last two decades. // Some say cultural factors keep the immigrants down . " The new people coming from Latin America are not coming with the primary intention of assimilating , " said Richard Weinstein , dean of the school of architecture and urban planning at U.C.L.A. // The Asians ' experience here approximates that of the Jews , Italians and other Europeans who came to New York 75 years ago , he said , but not the Latin Americans . Citing the huge high-school dropout rates for Hispanic students , Mr. Weinstein said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years is going to be Hispanic , we ' ll either have a separate economy or a magnification of social problems. " // But Mr. Kotkin , the author , said , " Obviously the Hispanics are not doing as spectacularly as the Asians , " adding that they were doing better than they seemed to be doing , benefiting from a significant underground economy , working as maids , gardeners and construction workers . The next generation , he said , will do better . " There ' s no evidence of the children of these people not speaking English , " Mr. Kotkin said . " I don ' t see L.A. getting poorer as a city . The analogy with old New York is a lot better than some think . " <> <> Conflict Between Ethnic Groups // Many Asians express contempt for Hispanic workers .

When Koreans come to America , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Hispanic immigrants admire but resent the Koreans . " They help each other more than Hispanics , " said Mr. Ramos , whose landlady is Korean and who once worked for a Korean . But he also said the Koreans often worked his people extremely hard for low pay , " almost as slaves. " // And now a growing number of whites like Mrs. Taggart of Anaheim are leaving all this behind . She recalls her family moving from New Mexico to Southern California in 1939 , when she was a child . She recalls a pleasanter time when the weather did not seem as hot , when there were orange groves near the grayish-blue stucco house the family bought 26 years ago , and when traffic was nothing . She raised five girls and a boy . " But now you can not go anyplace , see a play ; it takes too long , " she said . <> <> Harvests From Housing // Another factor spurring the exodus and deterring newcomers is the cost of housing . In June the median price of homes was $220 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Orange County , meaning only 12 or 13 percent of households could afford to buy a house , as against more than 20 percent just one year ago. // And so many people like Mrs. Taggart reap the huge real estate windfall , move to other parts of the country and live better . She originally paid $16 , 700 for her home , sold it at a tenfold profit and with the profit she says she will buy a place in Yelm , Wash. , near one of her daughters ; there , $52 , 000 buys a two-bedroom house with five acres . " It ' s so pretty and green there , " she said . " I have the feeling of being out in the country. " //
