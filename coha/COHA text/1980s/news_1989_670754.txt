Some 200 repairs , called for in a report to be presented to the Federal Aviation Administration today , would take several years to complete and involve perhaps 1 , 000 airplanes , eventually costing hundreds of millions of dollars. // Beginning the repairs has taken on new urgency in the wake of the rupture of the hull of a 19-year-old United Airlines Boeing 747 Friday on a flight from Hawaii to New Zealand . Nine passengers were swept to their deaths through a hole in the fuselage . <> <> Release Is Coincidental // But the fact that the report is being released so soon after the United Airlines accident is purely coincidental . The report , under way since last summer , was prompted by several incidents in the last year in which older airliners experienced structural failures in flight. // The industry ' s aim was to identify the repairs and establish standards for when to make them to pre-empt possible action by the Government to mandate a repair program . The industry is seeking quick approval of the program from the F.A.A. , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the program would make sure that the maintenance is done uniformly. // " We want to make sure that everybody is doing what is required at the time it is required , " said Clyde Kizer , vice president of engineering and maintenance at the Air Transport Association , an airline trade group , based in Washington , that is a sponsor of the study . " People who don ' t want to do the maintenance or can ' t afford to do it will be forced to do it. " // The report has identified as many as 200 repairs that it says must be made to some jetliners manufactured by the Boeing Company , including 747 ' s with age and service records similar to the craft involved in the accident Friday , and to Boeing 727 ' s and 737 ' s . <> <> Three Types of Planes // The repairs are divided among the three types of craft . In dozens of instances the repairs will require replacing structural pieces of airplane hulls , installing new rivets or carrying out other physical modifications that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The report says about 100 repairs must also be made on about 500 airliners manufactured by the McDonnell Douglas Corporation , including the DC-9 , DC-8 and DC-10. // Several hundred repairs must be made on aging airliners if the planes are to keep flying , the re-port said . It is the result of a study begun last year after an Aloha Airlines Boeing 737 lost part of its cabin roof April 28 on a flight over Hawaii in which a flight attendant was sucked out of the craft. // Investigators working on the United Airlines accident are focusing on a cargo door as the possible suspect . The door might have been improperly latched and come open , or a structural failure in or near the door could be related to the rupture , In the Aloha incident , the villain was found to be structural failure caused by corrosion and metal fatigue rather than the failure of a piece of equipment like a cargo door. // Since that accident , several other incidents of outer-hull ruptures in flight have led to concern for many older jets still in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When purchasing a modern airliner , the carrier usually expects the plane to remain in service about 20 years , after which it will be sold or junked . The plane in the United Airlines accident Friday would probably have been included in the proposed repair program. // Before that accident and the possibility of hulls rupturing on aging jetliners , the airlines and plane manufacturers had been examining better standards for making repairs to pre-empt possible action by Congress or the executive branch . The operators and makers were concerned that another disaster like the one Friday might spur the Government to order a repair program of its own . <> <> Technical Accuracy Emphasized // " We know something will have to be done , " said Mr. Kizer of the airline industry group . " We want it to be technically correct and not be arbitrary and political in nature . " He said he did not expect the United accident to affect recommendations to the aviation agency. // " The United accident will be looked at by the industry and the F.A.A. independently , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ negate what we have done with the study or the repairs that we are recommending. " // After the Aloha accident last year , the F.A.A. , the airlines and the jetliner manufacturers conferred and decided that the industry should come up with a new repair program . A study group was formed , using airlines ' personnel , and the Air Transport Association and the Aerospace Industries Association , another trade group , led the study . It focused on Boeing , McDonnell Douglas and all other jet transport makers , and airlines ' and manufacturers ' maintenance experts took part . <> <> What Service Bulletins Do // The study calling for the 200 repairs in a " service bulletin " like those issued by a jetliner ' s manufacturer . Such papers tell how an airliner should be maintained and what parts of it should be periodically inspected for mechanical problems. // Over a jetliner ' s life , a manufacturer might issue hundreds of those bulletins . A bulletin might , for instance , tell a plane ' s operator to inspect rivets in a seam and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the plane goes on flying. // After a certain amount of takeoffs and landings the plane must be reinspected . In many cases , these periodic inspections might continue indefinitely and no repairs might be required until an inspection turned up a problem . A repair would then be made and it would terminate the bulletin ' s advice and the need for future inspections . <> <> Traditional Concept Questioned // But the Aloha accident called that traditional concept of maintenance into question . The industry study group has been reviewing hundreds of such service bulletins on metal fatigue and corrosion , two major factors in a plane ' s ' aging , to determine if the bulletins are adequate. // Boeing engineers and representatives of several airlines that use Boeings looked at the records of Boeing airliners . About 700 of the service bulletins were examined . In some cases , the study groups decided that no change was necessary and that the inspections mandated by a bulletin were enough. // But the maintenance experts concluded that some other service bulletins might have to be " terminated . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be made : For example , rivets in a seam that had been inspected periodically would be replaced. // Before the Aloha disaster , operators of older 737 ' s examined certain seams in the airplane ' s skin for corrosion . If none was found , nothing had to be done until the next inspection . But after an investigation of the Aloha plane , the F.A.A. ordered that rivets be replaced in the seams of all older 737 ' s . The F.A , A. issued an " airworthiness directive , " making the work mandatory . Operators of the 737 ' s were given six months to three years to make the repair , depending the industry study will be several hundred million dollars , perhaps even $1 billion , and the work will take several years , industry experts say. // Boeing has said the cost of all the repairs recommended will be about $600 , 000 per airplane . About 700 older Boeing 727 ' s , 737 ' s and 747 ' s are involved . The McDonnell Douglas repairs on DC-8 ' s , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many as 500 airplanes . A cost per airplane has not been determined , but it could be several hundred thousand dollars , Mr. Kizer seatimated. // " Typically , the manufacturers underestimate the cost of these repairs , " Mr. Kizer said . Frequently , he added , as a repair is being made , an airline will discover something else that should be fixed . <> <> Airplane Age <> <> Average age of planes of commercial fleets as of July 1 , 1988 , as compiled by Avmark Inc. , an aviation appraisal company . **22;110943; <> **44;110967; **42;111013; <> **76;111057; <> AIRLINE <> **26;111135; YEARS <> <> **76;111163; <> American <> **26;111241; 10. 84 <> <> **76;111269; <> Continental <> **26;111347; 12. 12 <> <> **76;111375; <> Delta <> **26;111453; 9. 48 <> <> **76;111481; <> Eastern <> **26;111559; 15. 11 <> <> **76;111587; <> Northwest <> **26;111665; 15. 47 <> <> **76;111693; <> Pan Am <> **26;111771; 14. 63 <> <> **76;111799; <> Piedmont <> **26;111877; 10. 34 <> <> **76;111905; <> TWA <> **26;111983; 15. 29 <> <> **76;112011; <> US Air <> **26;112089; 10. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <> <> **76;112223; <> Overall average <> **26;112301; 12. 67 <> <> <> <> <> <> Source : Associated Press //
