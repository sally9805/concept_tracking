Mesquite is a brush , a shrub , a tree , an infestation and a tremendous thirst . <P> It sends down roots as deep as 40 feet ; it sucks up the earth 's moisture as if it were drinking through a straw . During the great drought of the 1950s , hardly a shower fell on Tom Green County for eight years ; only the mesquite lived well . Mesquite resembles an otherwise handsome tree afflicted by terrible arthritis , but it possesses a sort of peasant vitality . It is a vigorous , complacent survivor , an efficient brute of evolution , like the shark . <P> The ranchers in West Texas do not exactly like to talk about mesquite ; to do so is a little like discussing roaches with a New Yorker . But in some ways , mesquite controls and defines the landscape . Because it exerts such exorbitant claims upon a starkly limited water supply , mesquite ( in conspiracy with prickly pear , cedar and other heavy drinkers ) dictates what will flourish and what will wither ; it decides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to grow fat upon . Water and brush run certain segments of the West Texas economy in an almost embarrassingly thorough way . Sisyphus rolled a boulder ; a rancher in West Texas , tempted to reflect on the existential futility of life ( and that must happen now and then ) , can contemplate his mesquite . <P> In West Texas , nature still needs a good deal of subduing . Man and nature tend to be a little rough with each other . The weather runs to perverse extremes ; droughts have a way of ending abruptly in floods . Nature bangs around sometimes giving melodramatic and even lunatic performances . Now , in winter , the temperature will rise to 70 F or so one day , and the next , the wind will swivel around out of Canada to bring down a " blue Norther , " a deep , dry blast of almost metaphysical cold . " There 's nothing between here and the North Pole but a barbed-wire fence , " they tell themselves in that Texas way that can lend defiant self-congratulation to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down . " <P> <P> The ranchers of West Texas are ( on their own terms ) practicing environmentalists . But one should not , as a rule , attempt to discuss ideological ecology with a man throwing rocks at a rattlesnake . In the ranchers ' world , there are still good guys and bad guys in an older sense . Mesquite tends to be a bad guy . The rancher enjoys with his mesquite roughly the relationship that Wile E. Coyote maintains with the Road Runner in the children 's cartoon ; the rancher will try anything short of nuclear weapons to conquer mesquite . He even talks about it in vaguely military terms . <P> Hal Edward Noelke whumps out across his 18,000-acre ranch in his Bell bubble helicopter . " This mesquite , " he shouts above the rotor clatter , " is a very competent adversary . " Noelke can run his eye across the vast dun-brown landscape ( gentle hills , a sweep of mesas off toward the horizon ) , and although the land is comparatively featureless to a stranger , Noelke can tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stands of mesquite .
