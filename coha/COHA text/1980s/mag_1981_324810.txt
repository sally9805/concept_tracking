On Golden Pond burnishes age with the art of Hepburn and Fonda <P> It begins with images of serenity : wild flowers gently stirring in an almost imperceptible spring breeze ; loons , bright-eyed and sleek , afloat on untroubled waters ; the lake itself shimmering in the backlight of a dying sun . The first glimpses of Golden Pond are washed with the kind of burnished light that colors our recollections of better places and better times past . <P> The first glimpses of the aged couple who are reopening their comfortable old summer house are suffused with a similar light , though that is more a trick of the moviegoer 's memory than of the cinematographer 's art . For Katharine Hepburn and Henry Fonda arrive in On Golden Pond bearing with them not merely their vacation baggage but a montage of beloved images assembled from a combined 95 years of motion picture acting in 129 features , not to mention uncounted stage and television appearances . <P> Spunky Kate and Honest Hank ! If people were allowed to vote on such matters , the pair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are among the very few movie stars who have gone on working while four or five movie generations have grown up . By this time , their personal crotchets and graces , the events in the chronicle of their lives , have merged in the public mind with fragments from all those movies . Down the long corridor of the years , it seems we have encountered them at every turning . When they were young they gave lessons in romance ; in middle age they taught steadfastness and honor ; now it seems not only right but almost inevitable that they should come **26;6615;TOOLONG the first time , to share some of the pains and puzzlements of age with us . <P> It comes as a gift that the vehicle is literately written by Ernest Thompson and sensitively directed by Mark Rydell . On Golden Pond is a mature movie , and for the first time in years that does not make it an oddity . The youth audience the film industry has been wooing for more than a decade is growing up . According to an industry source @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are now over 29 ( only 25% were in that age group eight years ago ) . Very few major movies aimed at adolescents are being released this holiday season . Instead , the next weeks will offer Ragtime , an adaptation of E.L . Doctorow 's panoramic vision of turn-of-the-century America ; Reds , Warren Beatty 's life of Revolutionary John Reed ; Absence of Malice , a serious examination of journalistic ethics ; and Whose Life Is It Anyway ? , which is about euthanasia . Even the new John Belushi-Dan Aykroyd feature is far from Animal House ; it is an adaptation of Thomas Berger 's Neighbors , a farcically structured but coruscating novel about friendship . As if to stress the point , such legendary figures as James Cagney and Fred Astaire ( see boxes ) will be back on-screen before the year turns .
