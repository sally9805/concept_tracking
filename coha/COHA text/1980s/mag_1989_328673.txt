Stefania Follini could be forgiven for losing track of time . On Jan. 13 the 27-year-old Italian interior designer descended into a cave near Carlsbad , N. Mex. , where she was to live for more than four months as part of an experiment aimed at examining how the stresses of long-term isolation could affect space $ travel . Pioneer Frontier Explorations , an Italian research foundation , had selected Follini , one of 20 volunteers for the assignment , because she was judged to have inner strength and stamina . For 131 days she dwelled alone in a 20-ft. by 12-ft . Plexiglas module sealed 30 ft. under the surface , without sunlight or any other way of measuring time . Last week she emerged aboveground on schedule . But by her calculations it was only mid-March . <P> During Follini 's subterranean stay , her sense of time had elongated . Her " day " extended to 25 hours , then to 48 hours . She tended to sleep for 22 to 24 hours , then burst into activity for up to 30 hours . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ period stopped . In short , her internal biological clocks had gone out of whack . <P> The New Mexico experiment called attention to an emerging field in science called chronobiology , the study of the body 's innate , rhythmic patterns . Today researchers realize that many human characteristics , from basic physiological functions such as blood pressure and body temperature to mental sharpness and moods , follow such patterns . Some cycles are as brief as seconds ; the heart 's permeability to certain chemical ions appears to shift back and forth in less than a minute . Others are measured in months ; some people regularly fall into deep depressions in winter and cheer up in summer . <P> The best-known rhythms are circadian , from the Latin , meaning " about a day . " The sleep-wake cycle is the most obvious , but the body 's production of hormones also fluctuates significantly over 24 hours . Says Charles Ehret , president of General Chronobionics , a research and consulting company in Hinsdale , Ill. : " Chemically , you are a very different person at noon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daily cycles is a cluster of 10,000 nerve cells  --  altogether about the size of the head of a pin  --  that are located in the hypothalamus , a segment of the brain . Some biological timepieces appear to take their cue from temperature or barometric pressure , but many are synchronized with the cycle of light and darkness caused by the rising and setting of the sun . Experiments conducted in caves , like the one in New Mexico , and others in special laboratories purposely remove all such cues . In Follini 's module the temperature was a constant 69 degreesF , and the only illumination was artificial . The aim of such experiments is to get the body to " free-run " and see what sort of patterns it establishes on its own . <P> The conditions of Follini 's underground life were extreme , but people 's biological clocks can also be disrupted by the demands of everyday life . Jetting across time zones , working twelve-hour days or irregular shifts and even sleeping late can disturb biological rhythms and impair efficiency and judgment .
