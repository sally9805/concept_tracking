I arrived at the shelter in the early evening . Just before supper . Just in time to catch the nightly intake of the hundreds of men and women who , through alcoholism , or mental illness , or just plain hard times , had nowhere to call home but this shelter . It was one of a dozen in dozens of cities , tucked away in a commercial part of town where warehouses and loading docks didn ' t form neighborhood coalitions against the housing of the homeless. // I was here to put a face on what I thought was an all-too-faceless social problem . I had stepped around my share of breathing bodies lying on the side-walk in front of department stores . I had argued with myself over whether to feel anger or pity or simply gratitude that it wasn ' t me lying there gloveless and filthy . Mostly , I wondered how people could live like that. // // That ' s where the woman came in . The woman with neatly filed nails and beautiful skin who didn ' t wait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me if I was from a newspaper . Her breath smelled faintly of mint and she wore a yellow sweater . I thought at first she was a staff member , and told her I was touring the facility . Come back and talk to me , she said . I ' ll tell you what it ' s like to live here. // I was taken first to the men ' s side of the shelter , to their front door where I watched them being frisked , a man in a black baseball jacket running his hands lightly down their sides as the men stood silently in the first of many lines - a line for admittance , a line for supper , a line for bed . Here , there are only two rules : no guns , no violence . The men had only to get across the threshold to get a bed for the night . If they came late , they joined the 200 others lying on benches or the floor of the day room or the lobby . Every night it was the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lying in the doorway with a pink electric blanket wrapped around him , cradling a boom box . The man next to him was snoring . His coat was greasy with dirt and served as a pillow for both of them . Neither of them noticed me stepping over them , or the officer who stood a few feet away . A policeman was posted here 24 hours . Just in case . Overhead fluorescent lights blazed . They stay on all night , I am told . All night someone will be awake - awake and walking , awake and talking to someone or to themselves . All night the phone will ring. // Upstairs in the painted cement block rooms , I walk by rows of twin beds with rounded edges - nothing sharp here - and plastic-covered mattresses . Three hundred men sleep on secondhand designer sheets and under donated blankets . Each bed is made up for the night . Outside in the hall , someone ' s heels click by , and the low rumble from the men standing downstairs , crowded and jostling , rises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a woman here , I think . It is less crowded for them . They are neater . No torn bread crusts and spilled cups of soup in the corners . No loud bursts of laughter. // WHEN I am taken to their side of the shelter , a woman pushes open the door wearing a rabbit fur coat and suede boots . For a minute I think she works here , until I am told that the donations here are good ones , that the bulging sacks under the stairwell belong to the bag ladies , that the women do not steal from one another , that some of them do arts and crafts here . There are homemade paintings hanging on the walls. // Now , it is dinner time for the women . They sit on benches alongside a wall waiting for an empty chair . It is almost like a restaurant , I think , but not quite . Women from a local church are serving the meal , cafeteria-style . The handwritten menu is posted at the head of the line : three kinds of sandwiches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picnic tables , the women eat neatly . They do not talk , only peel back the wax paper from the sandwiches and take small bites . They do not look at one another or anyone else. // Soon it will be time for bed . Lights here go out at 9 p. m . No exceptions . The women will go upstairs , stand in line , put their clothes in a bin , put a rubberized band around their wrist . The band has a metal tab with a number on it . It is the number for their bed . In the middle of the night , if someone should call , the women can be located by number . Next , a woman staff member takes their clothes , hands them a nightgown and a towel . Both are clean and folded . There is some lace on one of the nightgowns . The women ' s own clothes are put into the ' ' oven , ' ' where they bake all night . This is to dry them and to kill lice . Then they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s showers are stalls fitted with curtains , not like the men ' s , a bare room with a guard posted . ' ' No more than 5 minutes in the shower , ' ' says a sign taped to the wall . It is almost like being back in gym class , I think . But it isn ' t . It isn ' t a school . It isn ' t even a home . And I still wonder how people can live like this. // I make my way down the stairs , under the cold fluorescent lights and with the smell of antiseptic all around me . Now the woman in the yellow sweater finds me again , corners me here in the common room . She doesn ' t wait for my questions , but starts to tell me that all the women here are unique , that it is not easy or right to categorize them . That is her word , categorize . She tells me that the women are divorced or displaced or just couldn ' t deal with the life they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get stabilized when you do not have a job . She has lived here 3 weeks ; this is her address . She tells me she is going back to school , that she is working on her secretarial skills . She tells me she is from Cleveland , has a job here now but not the $600 a month for an apartment . ' ' You know they give foot soaks here every night , ' ' she says . ' ' Some of the women really need them. ' ' // Outside it has begun to snow . I would like to go home . Or sit down , just for a minute . But the woman hasn ' t finished . She hands me a scrap of paper she took from the bulletin board that morning . ' ' This says it for a lot of us , ' ' she says , looking right at me . She is not smiling . Someone yells for her to come pick up her things from the floor . I look down at the paper . The handwriting is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me of a situation I never want to realize again. ' ' // I LOOK up at the woman . She is not smiling . Remember , she says , everyone here is different , everyone here is an individual . I think I will not forget this , when I am out walking and see a woman pulling bottles from a trash can with dirty , ungloved hands and I start to wonder how can people live like this. // I think I will remember this when I am tired and want to go home or sit down , just for a minute . I will remember the woman with no home , the woman with the neatly filed nails practicing her typing skills . I think I will remember that persistence does not have any particular address or wear any specific outfit ; that courage can be found in a gnarled hand gripping the lip of a garbage can. // But mostly I think I will remember that compassion is not limited to those who can write checks or their representative or articles for newspapers , that empathy might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over bowls of donated soup , and that concern for one ' s fellow human beings , as in the case of this one woman , does not even have to come with a name. // //
