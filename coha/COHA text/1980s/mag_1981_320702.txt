SPECIAL PROJECT THE BELIEF IN AN ever better tomorrow , the conviction that obstacles exist to be overcome and that the U.S. has a strong and beneficial role to play in the world-these constitute the American secular religion . <P> For some time now , that religion has been corroded by doubt . Intractable inflation seems to have turned the good life into a treadmill and has shaken our confidence in the future-America 's last frontier . Our industry appears to have lost its productive magic , its daring , and sometimes even its competence . Our Government is intrusive , inept-and expensive . Our democracy too often produces only mediocrity and deadlock . <P> Abroad , allies whom we rescued from the shambles of World War II defy us , former enemies whom we defeated now often outproduce and outtrade us . Our power is challenged by growing Soviet ambitions and military prowess ; by OPEC 's endless extortions ; by a chaotic , largely hostile Third World . Much of this situation was symbolized by two recent events that showed the U.S. relatively powerless : the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Is this what has become of the American Century ? <P> Not really . America 's domestic and foreign crises are genuine . But they have been widely exaggerated . The U.S. is more self-critical than any other nation ; it is also more resilient than most . The U.S. has not suddenly turned into a second-rate power , or even ( as is sometimes suggested ) into just another big power . It remains unique . It has immense resources-physical , intellectual , spiritual-which are not being fully or rightly used . <P> An American renewal is entirely possible . But it is not inevitable . It will not be accomplished by rhetoric , chest thumping , self-hypnosis . It will take great and disciplined effort and exact a considerable price . It will also require a virtue rare in America : patience . <P> That is the theme of the special editorial undertaking by all of Time Inc. ' s magazines this month : American Renewal . <P> The need for renewal ranges well beyond economics , politics and defense ; it encompasses ethics , morale , social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reach the largest possible audience are the reasons why we decided to spread this special project among all our publications , including those not primarily concerned with public policy . In more than a score of articles all together , each of the magazines treats a different set of issues and offers suggestions about what should be done . <P> We have not tried to cover every topic worthy of attention , and we make no claims to unique answers or unique wisdom . <P> We expect disagreement and debate . But as journalists who believe that our role should be constructive as well as critical , we have given the nation 's problems much thought ; we have also made a sizable effort to sift the thinking of others and to present what we believe to be the best and most promising proposals . We hope that concerned citizens and experts in many groups , organizations , schools and colleges-possibly even in Government-will consider these issues anew . Our chief purpose is to dispel the notion that nothing can be done . Thus we also report on many people who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begun their own American Renewal .
