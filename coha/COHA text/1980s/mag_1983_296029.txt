WHITE MISCHIEF by James Fox Random House ; 299 pages ; $15.95 <P> Hemingway made it his happiest hunting ground . Isak Dinesen , in Out of Africa , compared it to England in the 18th century , when an aristocrat might possess a " lovely landscape and a multitude of servants . " For Cyril Connolly , however , the East African colony of Kenya was no paradise lost . It was the site of a 1941 murder that obsessed the British essayist and critic for a decade . By the time Connolly died in 1974 , he had come tantalizingly close to finding the answer to the question that had mesmerized two generations of colonial society : Who shot Josslyn Hay , 22nd Earl of Erroll , hereditary Lord High Constable of Scotland ? <P> Connolly 's original partner in detection and the heir to his notebooks was James Fox , a British journalist who went on to reconstruct the crime and , after trips to Kenya and interviews with Lord Erroll 's friends , produce a plausible murderer . His gift for narrative immediately carries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and debauchery . White Mischiefs authentic cast of characters is as satisfyingly repellent a crew as ever peopled Black Mischief , Evelyn Waugh 's novel of English predators on the loose in Africa . <P> Feckless , flashy Lord Erroll was a leader of the British gentry that had settled in Happy Valley near Nairobi in the 1920s and 1930s seeking the openly hedonistic existence that was denied them at home . Unobserved except by the black servants whom they regarded as subhuman , the nobs did as they pleased . Lord Erroll 's specialty was seducing married women . " To hell with husbands , " was a favorite saying . " And to cuckold a man carelessly , while slapping him on the back or borrowing a fiver , added to his pleasure , " Fox notes .

The motive seemed compelling . Broughton 's bride of three months , Diana , 27 , had fallen in love with Lord Erroll and wanted a divorce . Always the gentleman , Jock acquiesced ; he even went so far as to bless the union of his erstwhile best friend and his bride . But as Lord Erroll remarked on the eve of his murder , " He has been so nice it smells bad . " <P> At the time , the Kenyan aristocrats closed ranks to protect one of their own , though most suspected Broughton of the crime . A friend gave him an alibi . Diana hired a brilliant defense lawyer from South Africa . After Broughton was acquitted of the murder , he received a cable from the Earl of Carnarvon and Montgomery ( HEARTY CONGRATULATIONS ON WINNING @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the trial at the palace of the Maharajah of Jhopur . Still , the smell persisted . Thirty years after the crime , Fox persuaded three people to talk about the murder confessions Broughton had made to them before he took a fatal dose of morphine in 1942 , 17 months after his acquittal .
