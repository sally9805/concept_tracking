The video will not play on MTV , but it is more curious than many that do . A Christian television station in Clearwater , Fla. , recently aired a 30-min. videotape made by Vice President and Presidential Aspirant George Bush , in which the lifelong Episcopalian attempts to answer the question of whether he is " born again . " Bush 's careful response : " If it 's defined as do you accept Jesus Christ as your Saviour , I 'm a clear-cut affirmative to that . " <P> Bush made the video to placate the evangelical right wing of the Republican Party , which has insistently questioned the depth of his conservatism and religious fervor . The video may reflect an attempt by Bush to corral voters who are potential supporters of a presidential bid by Televangelist Pat Robertson .
