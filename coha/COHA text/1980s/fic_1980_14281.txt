PAUL I thought I fuck everything up in the kitchen . CAROL Sweetie , I was angry . You 're not supposed to listen to what I say when I 'm angry . You 're just supposed to listen to the noise . It 's just noise , it 's not words . It did n't happen . I did n't say anything . I take it all back . PAUL But why did you get angry , that 's what I do n't understand . What did I say ? What did I do ? CAROL Nothing . There was no reason . I just got angry , that 's all . PAUL I thought you liked her . I thought you two were friends . p. 6 CAROL Who ? Jean ? I do . I like her .

I 'm tired of her hovering around all the time I 'm tired of I do n't like the way she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she does n't like me all that much really and I barely like her at all and she knows it and I why does she keep wanting me to go shopping with her and take yoga classes and have lunch ? p. 7 PAUL But she does like you . CAROL She likes you , Paul . She 's your friend . She keeps wanting to hang around with me so we can all be friends so she can be your friend and it wo n't look so obvious what 's going on . PAUL That 's bullshit . CAROL You know what she talks about when we 're together ? You . What a great guy you are . How lucky I am . How she wishes she had someone like you . How much fun she has with us , meaning you , what a perfect couple we are . I mean , I get the point . PAUL Well , if you feel that way why do you keep hanging around with her ? CAROL Because I 'm not going to give her the satisfaction of not hanging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know that ? Jean is a friend . She happens to be a woman . What 's wrong with that ? What 's wrong with the fact that I have a best friend that 's a woman ? I 'm a freak , all right , I 'm not normal , I do n't like baseball , I do n't like poker , I do n't like talking about women I 'd like to sleep with I do n't like beer . I like women , I like to be with them , I prefer it . It 's not sexual . I just enjoy spending time with Jean . CAROL Well , that 's terrific . PAUL You have men friends . It 's not sexual . p. 8 CAROL Who ? PAUL Who ? Well , Larry , for one . CAROL Larry 's gay . PAUL Gay ? He 's living with Vickie . CAROL He needs time . He 's a slow developer .

( Paul pours her a glass . She drinks . After a moment ) PAUL It was n't the carrot . CAROL Then what was it ? PAUL It was your poking the carrot with a pencil . CAROL This is a really grown-up conversation . I feel really adult . PAUL You asked . CAROL Paul , could we please have a talk-talk . This is stupid . This is n't getting us anywhere . PAUL We have to do the meal . p. 9 CAROL I do n't care about the meal right now . If we do n't figure out what this was all about before they get here , I swear when she walks through that door with her Elrod @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm going to shove the roast down her blouse .

She giggles ) PAUL What ? CAROL You 're just so cute . ( They drink ) PAUL Well ? It 's your turn . CAROL All right . Talk-talk . I want to tell you what I think happened . This is how I see it . You were making the salad . You were cutting the carrots . I was putting the roast in the oven . You were talking about Jean . Do you agree so far ? PAUL Yes . CAROL O.K. Now you were saying how much fun Jean is . How she really listens to what you 're saying , how she really seems to understand you , how she 's really interesting . ( Pause ) Well , is n't that what you were saying ? p. 10 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am too , goddamnit , I 'm all those things . PAUL I never said you were n't . CAROL It 's still my turn , let me finish . PAUL May I just say one thing ? CAROL What ? PAUL I think you 're all those things , too . It 's just that I happened to be talking about Jean . CAROL O.K. , you can tell me when it 's your turn . PAUL I love you , Carol . CAROL O.K. , do n't forget anything you 're going to say , but let me finish . PAUL You 're beautiful CAROL You were making the salad PAUL You 're sexy CAROL Thank you so I looked at the salad PAUL I want to make love CAROL Babe , please , let me finish . Let 's just clear this up and do n't keep trying to change the subject . PAUL All right , but I just want you to know while you 're talking , I want you to keep in mind the fact that I have an erection . p. 11 CAROL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Get an erection ? CAROL Forget it ( Carol rises angrily and starts out ) PAUL All right , I 'm sorry , I 'm sorry , I 'm sorry . I 'm an asshole . Come back . CAROL Will you listen to me ? PAUL Yes , I will listen to you . Come on , sit down . ( Carol sits back down ) CAROL You were cutting the carrots and talking about Jean and you did n't see me but I was looking at you . And I was wondering why you always think everyone is so great and interesting and wonderful all the time . And then I wondered what it would be like if I was the same way if I felt the same way about everything maybe that would be better , maybe I 'd be a better person I 'm just telling you what I was thinking about , and then suddenly I thought you 're the most beautiful man I ever saw and that surprised me because we 've been married six years and sometimes I look at you and you seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a date with you and make you fall in love with me and then I realize you 're my husband and it seems amazing to me . So , anyway , I saw you cutting the carrots and I thought would n't it be nice if we were bunny rabbits . p. 12 PAUL Bunny rabbits ? CAROL Yeah . We could be furry brown bunny rabbits and dig a hole in the ground and cuddle up together and and never ever see anybody and that 'd be all I want . It was just a thought . But I also thought this is n't the kind of thing I can say to you because well , because that kind of thing makes you uncomfortable so so instead I PAUL You poked my carrot with a pencil . CAROL Sweetie , I was just joking around . It 's a carrot , for Christ sake . I thought it was funny . I was having a good time , like wives can have with their husbands , just like their husbands can have with their best nonsexual female friends . PAUL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ angry at first . I asked nicely . The carrot is for the salad . You do n't poke a pencil into a carrot that is going into a salad . It 's unsanitary , you could get lead poisoning . CAROL Graphite poisoning , they do n't use lead in pencils . Look , Jean 's weird , she 's very weird , but she 's not so weird that she 's going to go rooting through the salad looking for carrots with puncture holes . We 're not suspected of being carrot puncturers . PAUL Why did you do it , that 's all I want to know . p. 13 CAROL I told you , I wanted to be a bunny rabbit . PAUL Bunny rabbits eat carrots . They do n't poke pencils into them . CAROL I was being a bunny rabbit with penis envy . ( They laugh briefly ) PAUL This still feels like an argument . ( Suddenly Carol cries openly , no warning . Paul holds her ) CAROL What we said before we did n't mean it , did we ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't want to split up , do you ? PAUL Of course not we were just I do n't know . CAROL Why did we say it ? PAUL It does n't matter . We did n't mean it . CAROL We 're the best couple I know . You 're not tired of being together , are you ? PAUL Carol , we were just angry . That 's all . Let 's forget about it . CAROL Jean told me people think we 're the perfect couple . PAUL Well , then we ca n't split up , can we ? We have too much to live up to . We ca n't disappoint all our friends . p. 14 CAROL Splitting up was not mentioned tonight . I declare it to have never been mentioned . PAUL I second the motion . CAROL Let 's get drunk before they get here . Let 's be really disgusting hosts . See if we can gross-out Jean 's new guy . Damn , the beans . Pour me a little more wine . ( Carol exits into the kitchen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were jealous , that 's all . You never have been . That 's why I was surprised when we have all these friends , we see them all the time , we talk about them behind their backs , they talk about us behind our backs , we all wonder who has the best life , the best relationship , the best sex , the best apartment , the most happiness . I mean , that 's what friends are for . ( Carol reenters ) CAROL Beans are on . What ? PAUL I said that 's what friends are for , to make you feel your life is n't as good as theirs , or that it 's better , or that it even makes any difference . What are you looking at ? CAROL It scared me , the things we said . PAUL It scared me , too . CAROL Was it moving out of the city ? Have you changed your mind ? p. 15 PAUL No , I want to get out of here . CAROL Was it having a baby ? PAUL No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been planning . I want it . I 'm happy . CAROL Then what was it ? PAUL Do you really think Jean 's trying to get something going with me ? CAROL If she is n't , she 's stupid . I would if I were her . PAUL Come here . ( Carol sits on his lap ) I do n't know why we talked about splitting up . I do n't want to . And I know you do n't want to . So , therefore , we never said it . All right . CAROL I 've had a terrible daydream I 've had it a bunch of times . PAUL What is it ? CAROL You remember the first week ? The vegetables ? PAUL I remember . CAROL Did we ever get out of bed ? PAUL No . Except for the vegetables . CAROL Remember that note they sent up , the people downstairs ? PAUL " We appreciate the fact that you are in love but some of us have to go to work in the morning and we 'd appreciate it if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Regards , 4B . " The Millers . p. 16 CAROL Yeah . PAUL Is that the daydream ? CAROL No , but it 's like that a little we 're lying in bed watching TV but the bed is n't really there and the TV and the room and the apartment are n't really there it 's more like a hologram , you can just put your hand through it , but we 're there . We 're the only things that are solid , and we 're sort of suspended . That 's how it feels . And on the TV there 's no programs , just commercials , all commercials and we keep waiting for a story to begin but it never does . And all the actors in the commercials are friends of ours . Bob and Marge are selling Toyotas . Jean 's selling fur coats and then the ads get weird and they start plugging new identities and countries you can have sent to you in the mail for a one-week trial period , and all our friends on TV look so happy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then we look at each other and realize that all we want to do is make love suspended in the middle of all this , so we roll over and start sliding around and jus then just right when we 're about to disappear into each other , the doorbell rings . That 's all . Ding-dong . It 's terrifying . We 're both scared out of our minds but we do n't know why . PAUL That 's it ? That 's the daydream . CAROL Marge thinks I should see a shrink . p. 17 PAUL Marge thinks everyone should see a shrink . ( The phone rings ) CAROL Do n't answer it . PAUL ( To phone ) We 're not here , sorry . We went out . We do n't live here anymore . We went to Canada . We do n't have a phone up there . Carol 's having a baby and I 'm writing a book and we 're happier than you are , so fuck you . Maybe it 's Jean ? ( The phone rings once more , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that smell ? Shit , the potatoes . Hang on . Pour me some wine . ( He gets up , stumbles a little ) Heeey , I 'm getting drunk . ( He exits . The phone rings . On the second ring ) CAROL I 'll get it . ( Answers the phone ) Hello ? Oh , hi , Jean no , no everything 's , we yeah , we 've been in . Oh , well , it must have been a wrong number . Listen , Jean it 's O.K. , we have plenty of wine Well , it 's up to you , if you want to no , we have dessert . We do n't need anything , Jean , we 're fine , do n't bring anything , do n't even come . ( Pause ) I was just joking it 's from a TV show we were just watching . O.K. , about ten minutes . See you . ( Carol hangs up . Paul enters with a tray of potatoes burnt to a crisp ) p. 18 PAUL This did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little overdone . You 're right , I fuck up everything in the kitchen . CAROL I 'll make rice . PAUL I 'll make the salad . Who was that ? CAROL Jean . PAUL She 's not coming ? CAROL She 's coming . PAUL Why did n't you tell her ? CAROL We invited them . PAUL This is going to be one fucked-up dinner . Friends . CAROL Good old friends . ( They laugh ) PAUL When are they going to be here ? CAROL About ten minutes . PAUL That means we have time . CAROL Now ? Right now ? PAUL Why not ? Then when they come we 'll know something they do n't know . I wonder if it shows . CAROL I slept with someone . PAUL What ? p. 19 CAROL Else . Someone else . I slept with someone else . PAUL Oh . Why do n't we sit down ? ( They sit down ) You slept with someone else . CAROL Yes . PAUL I see . Um . Why ? CAROL I do n't know . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend of Eric 's PAUL What 's his name ? CAROL I do n't know . I do n't know anything about him . I just slept with him . I met him on a bus with Eric . He bought me a coffee and then we went to his place and it did n't mean anything . It really did n't . PAUL That 's good to know . I feel better already . CAROL I bought a pound of apricots afterwards and I ate them all and got sick . And I felt better . PAUL So that 's what 's been going on here . That 's what this was all about . CAROL I do n't know what you mean . PAUL The argument . What happened in the kitchen . I wish I 'd known the rules . CAROL No . There 's no connection . I wanted to sleep with someone else , that 's all . It did n't matter who . He just happened to be there . I thought about you when I was with him . I thought maybe now I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll feel more interesting . p. 20 PAUL Is it my turn yet ? Are we still having a talk-talk ? I 'm not sure where we are right now . CAROL Because I 'm not very interesting , am I ? We go out with friends and we have a great time and you get into a good mood and you joke around and then when we get home you 're never like that . You get quiet . You do n't joke around with me because I 'm just not very interesting and I thought maybe if I did something I 'd never do , then I 'd be instead of being the kind of person who 'd never do certain things I 'd become I 'd be different than you thought I was . And you 'd joke around more . But it did n't change anything . I was still exactly the same as I was , and we were the same . Everything was the same . And then later much later I was happy that everything was the same . I was happy that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much later ? When did this happen . CAROL About three years ago . PAUL Jesus , Carol , I mean , Jesus and you 're telling me now ? CAROL Because it does n't matter . I want you to understand that sleeping with someone does n't necessarily mean does n't change anything . Between us . PAUL Your logic is really incredible , Carol . p. 21 CAROL What I 'm saying is that it does n't matter that you 've been sleeping with Jean . I 'm jealous , but I do n't care . PAUL What ? Who says I 've been sleeping with Jean ? CAROL It does n't matter . PAUL I 'm not sleeping with Jean . I 've never slept with Jean . I do n't want to sleep with Jean ! CAROL You 've never slept with her ? PAUL No . Who told you that ? CAROL No one . It 's just the way you keep talking about her I thought you Do you want to sleep with her ? PAUL No . Not at all . CAROL I made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy , did you ever ! You 're incredible , Carol you know that What are you trying to do here ? You waited for three years to tell me this because you thought I was sleeping with Jean ? CAROL I did n't wait . I never even thought about it . It just came up . PAUL I do n't believe you . CAROL ( Rage ) Why not ? Why do n't you believe everything about me ? Why are n't I someone who could do anything and you 'd believe it ? Why ca n't I poke your carrot and it 's O.K. ? Why do I have to be someone who does n't poke carrots if I want to ? Why do I always have to be me ? p. 22 PAUL Carol , calm down CAROL No , tell me why I ca n't be someone else . Why ca n't I be you ? Why ca n't I go out and teach history and have a roomful of kids who think I 'm brilliant and funny and smart and who respect me ? PAUL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't you think I 'm all those things ? Why do you think I just cook and clean and go to bed with only you and take part-time jobs where people do n't think I 'm anything except someone doing a part-time job . It 's not enough . Nothing is enough . PAUL I make you feel like you 're not enough . CAROL Everything everything . I 'm not enough , you 're not enough , nothing is enough . That 's why you want to split up , is n't it ? PAUL I do n't want to split up . CAROL You said you did . PAUL I thought we decided we 'd never said that . CAROL But we did . We said it . If we say something it 's because we mean it . We may mean something else too , we may mean exactly the opposite , but we also mean what we say . PAUL You 're the one that slept with someone . Why did you do that ? Because I 'm enough ? You were so happy with me that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 23 CAROL I did n't . It just happened . I did n't do it . Nothing happened . PAUL Well , if that 's the way you feel , then maybe if this is what 's really going on with us maybe we maybe we should think seriously about ending it . CAROL All right . PAUL All right . CAROL After dinner or before ? ( Pause . They burst out laughing ) PAUL This is some argument . CAROL You do n't have your period or anything , do you ? PAUL Want some more wine ? CAROL O.K. ( He pours more wine ) You 've never slept with anyone else ? PAUL So we 'll be even ? CAROL I 'm not talking about Jean . I mean anyone . PAUL No . CAROL Look at me . Never ? Not once ? PAUL No . All right . Once . Twice , twice . Only twice . CAROL You did ? PAUL Yes , once with p. 24 CAROL Do n't tell me . I do n't want to know who . I only want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't make any difference . PAUL Actually it was twice with the same person . CAROL Twice ? You mean you liked her ? PAUL No . Not really . She wanted to . I wanted to . We thought it might be nice and we I guess we wanted to know if what we thought was true . CAROL Was it ? PAUL Yes . CAROL It was nice ? PAUL Yes . CAROL Well then , that 's that . PAUL What do you mean ? CAROL We 're even . We 'll make your two equal one and it cancels out and that means we 're ( Carol cries and runs out . Paul pours the last of one wine bottle into his glass . Carol comes back into the doorway , calm ) Are you going to do the salad ? PAUL Who 'd get the apartment ? CAROL What ? PAUL It was mine before you moved in but you fixed up . We have to figure out who gets to stay here . p. 25 CAROL This is n't an argument anymore . ( Paul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) I hate you , Carol . I hate the way you dress , I hate the way you do your hair , I hate the things you say , I hate your jealousy , I hate the way you 've done the apartment , I hate the way you put everything emotional on your terms , I hate the fact that you do n't like my friends , I hate the way you make love , I hate being in this apartment with you , I hate the way you look at me , I hate this city , I hate teaching , I hate my life ( Banging on the floor below . Paul looks down at the floor ) Fuck you , Mr. and Mrs. Miller , just fuck you , you do n't like it when we screw , you do n't like it when we fight , what do you want from us , this is our home , we live here , mind your own goddamned business .

PAUL I even had a pretty good day . CAROL Let 's forget it . PAUL It 's so weird . We live here . We go out and work . We see friends . We eat . We make love . We 're married . This is our home . And that 's all . CAROL I love you . We 'll go to the country . You 'll do your book . We 'll have a baby . I love you ( They come out of their embrace ) I better put on the rice .

CAROL God , what would she tell Elrod. p. 27 PAUL Emery . CAROL Paul you 're so beautiful . I love you so much . You know that 's the first really bad argument we 've had in in a long time . I did n't like it . PAUL I did n't either . We really should fuck and make up . CAROL Really ? PAUL We could even stand by the door when they knock . We could listen to what they say .

No , the real reason I bought vegetables was because the first week we were together was the nicest time in my life and I wanted to find out whether it was you or the vegetables . p. 30 CAROL Which was it ? No , just tell me what happened PAUL We went to her place and chopped up all the vegetables and laughed because when we were all done there were so many vegetables we did n't have any place to put them .
