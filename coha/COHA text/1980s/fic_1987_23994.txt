for the men in easy-care Perma-Prest ; demure skirts and one-piece bathing for the women . Cupcakes usually do not attend Ivy League schools , suits however ; they attend state universities , because they believe that going to ' ; c:h001 out of state looks pretentious , isolates them from the gang , and excludes them from the network of potential business contacts they will need after graduation . Cupcakes do pledge fraternities and sororities ; Cupcake L2nd itself is a working out in maturity of the values , such as they are , learned so painfully in the crucible of the fraternity or the sorority house . Cupcake men drink beer in moderation at backyard barbecues ; Cupcake viornen do n't drink at all , fearing to misbehave ( " I get so silly " ) , or drink A glass of white wine , please . " If the waiter specifies " Chablis ? " they answer " That will be fine . " " Chardonnay ? " would elicit an identical response . Since to Cupcakes the only point of ordering a glass of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ type of wine is n't an issue ; and since Cupcakes in general know little about wine beyond what they 've learned from television advertisements , making it an issue would appear snobbish to their friends . So of course they do n't . The suburban home and yard are the sturdy trunk and root of Cupcake Land , The ideal yard in Cupcake Land is a monoculture of bluegrass or zoysia ( a hardier Southern hybrid ) , a carpet of brilliant green maintained unvarying through the vicissitudes of summer with herbicides , pesticides , fertilizer , mowing , trimming , and irrigation . The front yards of Cupcake Land , whatever their extent and however inviting their shaded green swards , are n't used . They 're purely decorative , like the pristine curb spaces in front of Cupcake houses , where cars in urban neighborhoods would be parked . Cars in Cupcake Land belong in built-on garages with the garage doors closed . Garages for cars exemplify the Golden Rule of Cupcake Land , which is , A place for everything and everything in its place . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hoods condemned criminals wear to the gallows hide the blender and the food processor , and white-enameled tin lids painted with meadow flowers disguise the plain , functional heating coils on the electric range . In Cupcake bathrooms , a needlepoint cover , slotted on top and bottomless , slips over the Kleenex box . Cupcakes go to church . They 're comforted to find so many similarly dressed and like-minded people gathered together in one place . If the sermons are dull , the setting is peaceful . God 's in his heaven ; all 's right with the world , except in unimaginable places like Iran . The Empress of Cupcake Land is Nancy Reagan , whom Kansas City Cupcakes adore  --  always impeccable , all her deals under the table , devoted to a cause for which she has found a pleasant solution ( " Just say no " ) that is the equivalent of Cupcake Land 's pleasant solution to poverty ( " Just get a job " ) , to AIDS and teenage sex ( " Just keep your legs crossed " ) , and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ronald Reagan is the Emperor of Cupcake Land , of course , pleasantness personified , financing the imperial expansion on plastic , resplendent in his new clothes . ' ve had some luck identifying when Kansas City ceded its south side to Cupcake Land ( I grew up on the east side of town , now the black ghetto , where the old urban life persisted a few years longer ) . It began around the time I was born , not much before . The late Edward Dahlberg remembered a brawnier and more vigorous Kansas City , for example , in his 1964 autobiography , Because I Was Flesh . " A vast inland city , " he described it , " a wild , concupiscent city . " He recalled " a young , seminal town " where " the seed of its men was strong . " Clearly this is not yet Cupcake Land ; the period Dahlberg is evoking is the decade before the First World War , when he was a small boy . " There were more sporting houses and saloons than churches " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forthcoming days he asks heatedly , " Could the strumpets from the stews of Corinth , Ephesus , or Tarsus fetch a groan or sigh more quickly than the dimpled thighs of lasses from St. Joseph or Topeka ? " But by the 1930s , on the evidence of Evan S. Connell 's autobiographical 1959 novel , Mrs. Bridge , Cupcake Land was up and running , as if it Came along one sinister Christmas complete and fully assembled , in a Pandotan box . Mrs. Bridge , a young Kansas City society matron , already shops en the Country Club Plaza , where presumably she bought her guest towels : She had a supply of Margab , which were the best , at least in the opinion of every . one she knew , and whenever guests were coming to the house she would put the ordinary towels in the laundry and place several of these little pastel towels in each of the bathrooms . They were quite small , not much larger than a handker. chief , and no one ever touched them . After the visitors had gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replace them in the box till next time . Nobody touched them because they looked too nice ; guests always did as she herself did in their homes  --  she would dry her hands on a piece of Kleenex . Mrs. Bridge is conversant primarily with just such matters as towels , Connell observes , as well as the by-laws of certain committees , antique silver , Royal Doulton , Wedgwood , the price of margarine as compared to butter , or what the hemline was expected to do . " She knows the bedrock rules of Cupcake Land , which would seem not to have changed much these past sixty years . " Now see here , young lady , " she scolds one of her laugh , ters , " in the morning one does n't wear earrings that dangle . " Edward Dahlberg revisited Kansas City late in life ; his cantankerous but perspicacious reaction confirms the area 's Cupcaking : These cities , which are full of every kind of man and woman dirt , and have the most repulsive sex and movie dives , and prurient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have citizens , who are crazy about the word CLEAN . Clean health , clean living , clean politics ! Only the corrupt can use this tabu word so easily . of many blacks live in Cupcake Land : white flight was a major force behind its founding , and it 's nearly impossible to cross the invisible lines that toothless laws tolerate and realtors maintain . Recently I rented an apartment in an old restored building in midtown Kansas City ( wonderful Nutbread Land , a slice of the spirited Kansas City I remember from childhood , trucks unloading outside grocery stores and buses going by , peo , pie of all sizes and shapes and colors walking real sidewalks , some of them talking to themselves ) . " Funny thing , " the rental agent told me , " the people who rent here are almost always from somewhere else . Kansas Citians all want new . " To find the new , however diminished  --  and to escape the desegregation of the public-school system that began in 1955 and is still not complete  --  Cupcake recruits moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kansas , last year 's cow pasture become this year 's pseudo-Colonial or French Provincial suburb . Freight wagons used to follow the Santa Fe Trail from Kansas City out through Johnson County ; developers today , putting up houses and shopping malls along that trail , seem bent on moving the city itself to Santa Fe . Not that Kansas City Cupcakes dislike blacks , exactly . They avoid them not necessarily because they think them inferior but because they know them to be different , Cornbread rather than Cupcake , just as the blue-collar whites who live south and east of Kansas City in Pancake Land are different . In that difference Cupcakes measure a strong potential for unpleasant encounter . " What would I say to one ? " Connell , in Mrs. Bridge , reinforces this analysis , depicting discomfort rather than active hostility in black-white relations at the borders of the Country Club District . " The niggers are moving in , " Mrs. Bridge 's daughter announces provocatively one day : Mrs. Bridge slowly put down the tray of cookies . She did not know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On the one hand , she herself would not care ? to live next door to a houseful of Negroes ; on the other hand , there was no reason or to . She had always liked the colored people she had known . She still thought not of Beulah Mae a laundress long departed for California and worried about her , wondering if she was still alive . She had never known any Ne- wes socially ; not that she avoided it , just that there were n't any in the ? neighborhood , or at the country club , or in the Auxiliary . There just were n't any for her to meet , that was all . The Country Club Plaza is supposed to be a place for strolling , window-shopping , watering at one of its several outdoor cafes . ( Alternatively , one may ride in a horse-drawn carriage , a la Central Park : at the height of the season more than a dozen carriages work the Plaza , an area only about ten city blocks in extent . They tour no park but streets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) A little posse of black children biked into this pleasant setting one afternoon in the heyday of breakdancing . They unrolled their pads of cardboard and linoleum , cranked up their ghetto blasters on a centrally located corner outside a men 's clothing store , and got down . They were good ; spinning and double-jointing through their repertoire , they drew an appreciative crowd . But the Nichols Company does n't want vulgar street entertainment within the confines of the Plaza , particularly when the entertainers are unlicensed and black . Security guards elbowed through the crowd , spread-eagled the children against the wall , handcuffed them ( or tried to  --  the cuffs kept slipping off one small boy 's wrists ) , and dragged them away . In a subsequent year teenagers began to cruise and promenade the western end of the Plaza , to see and be seen , perhaps drawn by the McDonald 's installed in a mall building there without golden arches but with a bronze statue of a seated lad eating a bronze hamburger and reading a bronze book . The Nichols Company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Cuban mercenaries . First it tried to barricade the streets . That inconvenienced paying adults as well as conspiring teens . Next it sent in its security guards , gun-toting men paid not much more than minimum wage and trained initially only eight hours in their trade lawsuits for brutality and false arrest are still pending . Finally the Nichols Company arranged with the Kansas City Police Department to set up a command post on the Plaza , et in Arcadia ego , from which police fanned out to arrest anyone committing even the most obscure infraction  --  shirt unbuttoned , one taillight out , taking a leak in the parking-lot bushes . That draconian measure seems to have cleared the kids away . I walked with them one Saturday night not long before the end . They were , for the most part , clean , wonderfully wide-eyed , and duded up  --  and black . Their real offense was that they scared Cupcakes away . To obscure its bawdy history Kansas City lays claim to an ersatz no-They were clean , wonderfully wide-eyed , and duded up  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cupcakes away analysis ) , child encounters parent instead of child encountering child . " I do n't mind . I enjoy cuddling . Let 's try again next time . " Cupcakes , I 'm afraid , lack spice . A year ago I moved to the Missouri countryside to find out what rural life had become in the thirty years since I left the farm . ( My farm career was an adolescent interlude , six years at a boys ' home and farm outside Independence , Missouri  --  but we bused ourselves to school in Kansas City . ) The morning of the first day of my visit I met the farmer I would be following , whom I call Tom Bauer , at the outdoor feeding floor where he finishes hogs for market . One of the hogs had a prolapsed rectum , Tom explained , which he was going to try to fix . The poor animal was n't hard to identify . Knee-high , weighing about 100 pounds  --  half-grown  --  it was pink , with coarse white hair , and a swollen , bluish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of attacks by the other hogs the prolapse was bloody . " You cai n't always fix ' em , " Tom told me . " Sometimes you work them back in and they come back out . Then you 've lost the animal for sure . But we 're gon na try . " Tom 's big sixteen-year-old son , Brett , was at hand . He slipped into the pen and skillfully caught the hog by a back leg and dragged it out into the aisle . His father pulled on a sterile plastic glove . " We got to haul it up by its hind legs and hang it over the gate , " Tom directed . Brett caught the other leg and worked the animal around as if it was a wheelbarrow until its Kelly approached the gate , which was framed with smooth iron pipe . But the hog 's legs were slippery with brown , pungent hog manure . Strapping kid though he is , a reserve guard in high-school football , Brett struggled to lift the animal into position . I did n't think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farm . but on the other hand , the boy needed help . I took a deep breath  --  not , in those redolent surroundings , the wisest decision I ever made  --  stepped to Brett 's side , grabbed one shit-covered leg , timed my effort with the boy 's , and heaved the hog over the gate so that it hung down bent at the hip , its butt in the air . Brett and I held on then while Tom carefully worked the poor animal 's rectum back into its body , the hog screaming in unavoidable pain . " Gross , " Brett said . Then his dad was finished and we let the animal gently down . It did n't prolapse again  --  it lived , to be trucked at 250 pounds to the slaughterhouse for pork chops to grace the tables of Cupcake Land . I adjusted to the realities of farm work quickly enough , having grown up in the trade . But I realized that first morning as I pushed through my initial cultural shock how far removed Kansas City has become from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ removed yet  --  too far , I fear , for any straightforward recovery . To make life pleasant seems a worthy enough goal in the abstract , but increasing control and decreasing surprise is finally stifling . Full-blown and pathological , it results in life-threatening sensory deprivation . Cupcake children in their pervasive and much remarked ennui show symptoms of such deprivation . Only last summer a crowd of well-provisioned Johnson County teens raged through their suburban neighborhoods smashing cars ; Cupcake opinion of the rampage blamed permissive education . Talk is general these days of a brutal recession on its way , the ugly sequela of the Reagan years . That would be a terrible betrayal of Cupcake trust . Chatty Churchills wo n't guard the gates to Cupcake Land then , or tea cozies hood the disaster , or cuddling comfort the bewildered , or credit cards pay the bills . If any good might come from such a consequence it would be the lifting of the burden of pretension from Cupcake backs . Like other Cupcake outposts across the land , this plainspoken river-bluff city I know and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sooner or later , such artificial barriers always collapse . The Missouri River will still be around then , ready in its brown flood to sweep the stale crumbs away . People I respect who care about this place counsel patience , but it 's been a damned long wait . ? A N N O T AND NOW FOR SOMETH1 What 's coming up and goir Twenty years ago this month , the architects of the Great Society set out to open a channel of high-minded communication free from commercial TV 's wanton toadying to money . The founders pulled together a loose confederation of local educational and university stations and begot Public Television . The new medium promised new voices , more culture , and creative programming : quality television . Although eloquent about their purpose , the founders , alas , failed to establish a secure source of money . Instead of liberating PBS from the thrall of commerce , they shackled their good intentions to a Catherine wheel of perpetual need . As a result , this prime-time anniversary lineup is no cause for rejoicing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheap . Foreign imports ( shaded in gray ) make up an astounding thirty-one of the eighty-four hours  --  more than a third of this schedule . Importing a show costs a fraction of what it does to produce one . What PBS imports is often embarrassing . Buster Keaton : An American Masters Special is produced by Thames Television . Another upcoming series , Television  --  the history of a chiefly American phenomenon is a re-edited British production . There is a reason for this : England spends about $30 per capita on public television while in America we spend less than a dollar . Jack Hitt is an associate editor of Harper 's Magazine . A T ION NG COMPLETELY CHEAP down at PBS , by J ark Hitt Another source of money is PBS 's small crowd of viewers . Because only 10 percent of the audience contributes , PBS plays a Lilliputian ratings game . Like the networks , it sets programming to hold the audience  --  specifically , donor-viewers . This means building a mood throughout the evening or , in the jargon , " hooking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hour-long shows , which reduces the dial-changing chances from two per hour to one . Also note the bland homogeneity of each night 's offering : A truly original show wedged between Thursday 's The Adams Chronicles , Mystery ? and Upstairs , Downstairs would seem like a skunk at a lawn party . Other than furry animal features and Anglomaniacal soap operas , the only shows comfy in such fellowship are tranquilizing documentaries such as The First Eden , Nova , The Story of English , and Discover , which suffer from their only strength .
