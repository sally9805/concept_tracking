There ' ll be a festive air at the Oxford Ale House in Harvard Square tonight , when one of Boston ' s premier jazz saxophonists , John Payne , celebrates 52 consecutive Mondays playing at that venerable pub . " We ' re so comfortable there now after a year , " said Payne over the weekend , " that it ' s like playing in our living room . We ' re loose , mixing our well-worked-out tunes with material we choose on the spur of the moment . " Adding another upbeat note to tonight ' s proceedings is the news that the Ale House management has decided to renovate the rooms , and change the music policy ( except for Payne it ' s been mostly all hard rock cover bands ) . " We ' re going back more to the old Oxford Grille concept of a few years back , " said co-manager Jim Hogan . " There ' ll be a kitchen , probably a raw ( food ) bar , and the music format will be folk , folk-rock , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will stay , and we hope to bring in some of the best small groups around , including some of the best from the summertime happy hour scene down on Cape Cod . Project should take a month or so , but we ' ll stay open the while . " Payne is working in a quartet setting now , having dropped guitar from the quintet format he was using a year ago . " Some of the tunes were getting a bit long , " he said , " and I do like everybody to have solo room . " Bassist BobSinicrope has stayed on with the band , while two relatively new members round out the lineup : Pianist Bruce Katz and drummer Vinnie Albanese ( a busy man , since he also plays with Heidi Metzger and the Hotheads ) . Payne is equally at home on alto , tenor and soprano saxes , and his flute work is also outstanding . He is thoroughly eclectic , drawing inspiration from jazz classics from the 1920s onward , but also Brazilian-Portuguese sambas , traditional R &B; and contemporary funk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Average White Band . ( The John Payne Student Saxophone Choir , a group of 20-30 players who study at Payne ' s Brookline music school , opens at every Payne gig , and one of the nine current numbers in their crowd- pleasing repertoire is AWB ' s " Pick Up The Pieces . " ) Duncan Martin , who directs the choir , also has written some second parts to the Charlie Parker tunes , " Confirmation " and " Donna Lee , " and when he joins Payne on stage for a dueling altos session around Bird ' s music , the Ale House smokes . Now 35 , Payne has been getting paid for making music since he was 14 - when he joined his banjo-playing father on clarinet at a traditional jazz gig . He went to Harvard to major in philosophy , but also took up soprano while he was there , and added some tasty licks to a fine album made by a singer from Belfast who was living in Cambridge in the late 1960s : Van Morrison ' s " Astral Weeks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bromberg and Phoebe Snow ; formed his own band with keyboardist Louis Levin ; appeared on many albums ( including at least five as leader or co- leader ) ; and opened his John Payne Music Center . But he may be happiest about the student choir . " Yup , I figure I can take ' em from cradle to grave , " he said , laughing . " No really , they ' ve actually had two paid gigs so far : Opening for Robert Ellis Orral at the Paradise in August , and at WBZ-TV ' s Kidsfair on Boston Common last fall . At the Ale House , they get more whoops and hollers than my outfit does sometimes ! " There ' s more good music news out of Harvard Square this week . Wednesday night at Sanders Theater , the Harvard Folklore Department and Black Dog Productions are presenting a concert of contemporary music and dance rooted in Southern tradition : The Red Clay Ramblers , Robin &; Linda Williams , and Beverly Cotten are the performers . The Red Clay Ramblers hail from North @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " with , " as Black Dog ' s Kari Estrin says , " a smattering of jazz or an occasional hint of rock thrown in along the way . " The Williamses ( heard often on " A Prairie Home Companion , " the National Public Radio show broadcast here on WGBH-FM ) write original songs in the Southern tradition , sing beautiful harmonies and pick fine guitar and banjo . Beverly Cotten , a third-generation buckdancer and clawhammer banjo player , is another delight from Carolina . A blue ribbon ( American Film Festival ) work by the Michigan WomenFilmmakers is the main attraction at two benefits next weekend for the NO- MATEP organization . The film , " See What I Say , " studies Susan Freundlich and how she interprets music for the deaf , specifically the music of Holly Near as performed at Boston ' s John B. Hynes Memorial Auditorium during Near ' s antinuke tour in 1979 . Also on the bill is a powerful topical film , " Mission Hill and The Miracle of Boston .
