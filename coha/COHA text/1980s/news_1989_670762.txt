But it is not only the elephant ' s survival that is at stake , conservationists say . Unlike the endangered tiger , unlike even the great whales , the African elephant is in great measure the architect of its environment . As a voracious eater of vegetation , it largely shapes the forest-and-savanna surroundings in which it lives , thereby setting the terms of existence for millions of other storied animals - from zebras to gazelles to giraffes and wildebeests - that share its habitat . And as the elephant disappears , scientists and conservationists say , many other species will also disappear from vast stretches of forest and savanna , drastically altering and impoverishing whole ecosystems. // Just as the American buffalo was hunted almost to extinction a century ago , so the African elephant is now the victim of an onslaught of commercial killing , stimulated in this case by soaring global demand for ivory . Most of the killing is illegal , and conservationists say that although the pressure of human population and development contributes to the elephants ' decline , poaching is by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be on the way to becoming a mere zoological curiosity like the buffalo , but the trend is clear. // As recently as the 1930 ' s , some 10 million elephants lived south of the Sahara . By 1979 only 1. 5 million remained , according to scientists ' best estimates , and in the decade since then their numbers have been cut to an estimated 650 , 000 . The problem is compounded by the elephant ' s relatively slow rate of population replacement . It gestates for 20 to 21 months and takes 15 to 20 years to reach breeding age. // " The richest continent in the world in terms of large mammals is up against a real crisis , " David Western , a wildlife biologist who is the Nairobi-based director of Wildlife Conservation International , a division of the New York Zoological Society , said in a telephone interview. // In an atmosphere of mounting alarm among conservationists , a new international coordinating group backed by 21 ivory-producing and ivory-consuming countries met in London earlier this month and adopted an ambitious plan of action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is aimed both at stopping the slaughter of the elephants in the short term and nurturing them as a vital " keystone species " in the long run. // Some leaders of the organization , the African Elephant Coordinating Group , say there may not be much time left . If no action to control the ivory trade more effectively is taken by the end of this year , they say , world opinion will probably demand a global ban on the trade . This , they say , would merely drive the trade underground , making it impossible to control . They argue that this might result in the elephant ' s disappearance as a species of major importance before a new rescue effort can succeed. // It is the elephant ' s metabolism and appetite that make it a disturber of the environment and therefore an important creator of habitat . In a constant search for the 300 pounds of vegetation it must have every day , it kills small trees and underbrush and pulls branches off big trees as high as its trunk will reach . This creates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the woodlands that cover part of the African savannas . The resulting patchwork , a mosaic of vegetation in various stages of regeneration , in turn creates a greater variety of forage that attracts a greater variety of other vegetation-eaters than would otherwise be the case . <> <> Diversity of Species // In studies over the last 20 years in southern Kenya near Mount Kilimanjaro , Dr. Western has found that when elephants are allowed to roam the savannas naturally and normally , they spread out at " intermediate densities . " Their foraging creates a mixture of savanna woodlands ( what the Africans call bush ) and grassland . The result is a highly diverse array of other plant-eating species : those like the zebra , wildebeest and gazelle , that graze ; those like the giraffe , bushbuck and lesser kudu , that browse on tender shoots , buds , twigs and leaves ; and plant-eating primates like the baboon and vervet monkey . These herbivores attract carnivores like the lion and cheetah. // When the elephant population thins out , Dr. Western said , the woodlands become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from poachers forces elephants to crowd more densely onto reservations , the woodlands there are knocked out and the browsers and primates disappear. // Something similar appears to happen in dense tropical rain forests . In their natural state , because the overhead forest canopy shuts out sunlight and prevents growth on the forest floor , rain forests provide slim pickings for large , hoofed plant-eaters . By pulling down trees and eating new growth , elephants enlarge natural openings in the canopy , allowing plants to regenerate on the forest floor and bringing down vegetation from the canopy so that smaller species can get at it. // In such situations , the rain forest becomes hospitable to large plant-eating mammals such as bongos , bush pigs , duikers , forest hogs , swamp antelopes , forest buffaloes , okapis , sometimes gorillas and always a host of smaller animals that thrive on secondary growth . When elephants disappear and the forest reverts , the larger mammals give way to smaller , nimbler animals like monkeys , squirrels and rodents. // " As the forest becomes more mature , " Dr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ animals in the forest , and it ' s quite possible that in some places they would disappear as the elephant disappears . " On the savanna , he said , zebras , wildebeests and gazelles " would disappear in some very important areas that are now grassland . " <> <> Governments Join Effort // The new African Elephant Conservation Coordinating Group includes 12 governments and such conservation groups as Wildlife Conservation International , Dr. Western ' s organization ; the World Wildlife Fund , the European Economic Community and a number of organizations that deal with endangered species and international trade in animal products . The United States , which last year enacted tough measures against the illegal ivory trade and is starting to carry them out , has also expressed interest in joining the association. // The action plan adopted by the group in London starts from the premise that it will be impossible to save all 650 , 000 remaining elephants . Human population growth and the pressures of development make this certain even if poaching could be stopped immediately. // Rather , the goal is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ habitat areas and to focus efforts and resources on them . By saving the 200 , 000 to 300 , 000 elephants in those areas , the group hopes to preserve the " essence of the species " and maintain essential habitats for other large mammals. // The plan envisions a new effort to curb trade in illegal ivory and to help combat poachers by enlisting local populations in the cause . Poachers " are like guerrillas ; they need the support of the people to operate , " said Curtis Bohlen , senior vice president of the World Wildlife Fund in Washington , a key organizer of the new coordinating group . <> <> Strategies to Stop Poachers // Experiments in Zambia , Zimbabwe and Kenya offer hope that local residents can be enlisted to stop poaching and stabilize elephant populations , leaders of the group say. // The experiments rely on the assumption that the elephant is a valuable economic resource quite apart from ivory . They appeal to residents ' economic self-interest by allowing them to capitalize on and benefit from that resource. // In one experiment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another , residents are given preferential treatment in employment in hotels , park services and other tourist-related enterprises . In still another , unrelated to the tourist trade , local residents " cull " the elephant herds selectively to maintain their health . A leather-and-meat industry has grown up as a result , and the ivory gleaned is sold legally . But the elephants are maintained. // In the Kenya program , Maasai tribespeople are allowed to hunt elephants for meat when drought reduces their own herds ' productivity. // In all three experiments , poaching has been reduced . In at least one , in Kenya , the decline of the elephant has been reversed and that of the zebra and wildebeest as well . This has happened , proponents believe , because local people now have a vested interest in elephant conservation and have an active role in making decisions about management of elephant herds. // " In the past , " Dr. Bohlen said of the Zambian experiment , " local people just let poachers come through their lands . They had no reason to care . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ don ' t let them through anymore. " // Some countries , notably Zimbabwe , Kenya and Tanzania , have introduced tough measures against poachers . In Zimbabwe , for example , poachers are shot on sight . But organizers of the new conservation drive say that most governments are too impoverished to afford either adequate enforcement or conservation efforts . The group is trying to raise $20 million over the next five years to help African governments that are willing to cooperate . The United States has authorized $5 million a year as a contribution to this fund , but none of the money has yet been appropriated. // Three years ago , in response to the poaching problem , a quota system for the ivory trade was established by signers of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora , which include the United States and almost 100 countries . Virtually no one believes that the quota system works as intended . The major reason , Dr. Bohlen said , is that the ivory-export quotas assigned to each producing country are not based on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' re just what a country wants to export , " Dr. Bohlen said. // Signers of the accord plan to consider new regulations when they meet in Lausanne , Switzerland , next October . If they can devise no way to control the ivory trade effectively , some conservationists believe , the signatories might be driven to declare the elephant endangered . Trade in ivory would thereby be banned globally . If that happens , the conservationists fear , the elephant could suffer the fate of the black rhinoceros . Trade in rhinoceros horns was internationally banned , but the illegal market went underground and flourished , and today only 3 , 700 black rhinoceroses remain in Africa. //
