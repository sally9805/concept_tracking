As the economy falters , Mugabe angers both blacks and whites <P> The scene was eerily reminiscent of pre-independence demonstrations during the late ' 70s , only this time it was not blacks against whites , but blacks against blacks . Outside Salisbury 's Ministry of Education and Culture , some 400 angry teachers striking for higher wages and better working conditions last week unsuccessfully demanded an audience with Dzingai Mutumbuka , the Education Minister in the government of Prime Minister Robert Mugabe . Shouted one protester : " Come out if you are not a coward ! " The police soon moved in to arrest the teachers , along with a number of angry nurses who were besieging another government building . Government officials immediately outlawed further demonstrations as part of a new crackdown on dissent . <P> The offenders were quickly released , but their rebellious mood accurately reflected the deteriorating confidence of many Zimbabweans , both black and white , in the 18-month-old Mugabe government . After a euphoric year of independence , Zimbabwe is beset by a variety of serious economic and social problems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaders of the struggle never promised an instant Garden of Eden . The nation must choose the hard road now . " <P> Zimbabwe 's economy , which expanded a remarkable 25% during 1980 , will have a 10% rate of real growth this year . That is still a high figure by most standards ( the predicted U.S. rate for 1981 : less than 1% ) , but one that conceals growing problems such as a scarcity of gasoline and diesel fuel and spot shortages of butter , cheese and meat . An inflation rate of 20% has more than wiped out gains in wages . Foreign investors , skittish about recent government takeovers of the Zimbabwe Banking Corp. , the country 's most prominent chain of newspapers and Caps holdings , a pharmaceutical company , have shied away from financing new projects . Exports of important mining and agricultural products have been seriously affected by cutbacks , falling prices and transport problems , causing a shortage of hard currency to buy badly needed goods and services . <P> Mugabe promised a government dedicated to reconciliation between blacks and whites @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of transforming " our society in the interests and for the benefit of the broad masses of our people . " The government 's latest budget targets the new nation 's upper class , which remains largely white : a 30% capital gains tax , an increase in estate levies and the elimination of tax deductions for business entertainment expenses . <P> The response of unprecedented numbers of whites , who still run most of Zimbabwe 's commerce and agriculture , has been to pack up and leave . Some 18,000 to 20,000 have departed since the beginning of the year , reducing the country 's white population to an estimated 180,000.
