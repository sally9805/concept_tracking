EMPLOYEES ENTERING Fingermatrix Inc. ' s building in North White Plains , N.Y. , don ' t need an identification card or a key to get through the small plant ' s locked but unguarded doors . Instead , the employee approaches a small machine at the door , punches in his or her three-digit identification number and then pokes a finger into a small lighted opening . In a few seconds the door unlocks . The machine is Fingermatrix ' s answer to one of the more onerous technological problems faced by computer engineers : machine reading of fingerprints . When the worker punches in his identification number , the machine calls up a copy of his pre-filed fingerprint . It then scans the employee ' s finger to see if it matches the fingerprint on file . If so , the door unlocks . Since fingerprints , unlike ID cards or keys , can ' t be altered , counterfeited , stolen or lost , the machine represents one of the most foolproof identification systems yet devised . For Michael Schiller , the automatic fingerprint reader @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Schiller , an electrical engineer with experience in machine reading of microfilm , founded Fingermatrix in 1970 , when it seemed to him and many other engineers that machine reading of fingerprints was just around the corner . AT THAT TIME , Calspan Corp. , a company created when Cornell University spun off its aeronautical laboratory , had developed a machine that could read fingerprint cards , such as those used by police , and convert the fingerprint pattern to digital data that could be stored and retrieved by computers . The Calspan technology , which Fingermatrix bought and improved , is being used by the Federal Bureau of Investigation in a long-running program to computerize the 83 million fingerprint cards it has on file . The fingerprint card reader , which looks like a large photocopying machine , records in digital form each fingerprint ' s " minutiae points , " the points where the tiny ridges end , divide or join . Each fingerprint contains 80 to 100 of these minutiae points and their number and location are the basis of fingerprint identification . It seemed at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fingerprint cards to reading prints on live fingers . Mr. Schiller dreamed then  --  and now  --  of a huge market for such print readers . In addition to identifying individuals seeking entrance to high security industrial and government facilities , the fingerprint checker could make credit cards counterfeit-proof : A small machine at the cash register could check the customer ' s fingerprint to see if it matched the print pattern electronically imbedded in the card . FINGERPRINT READERS at international airports could similarly detect forged passports and spot known criminals and terrorists whose fingerprints would be stored in the computer ' s blacklist . " There ' s a $12 billion market out there " for such fingerprint readers , Mr. Schiller says . Armed with seed money from the security-conscious Air Force , Fingermatrix engineers tried to adapt the card reader to reading " live " prints . " We tried three or four times to get a production mode , but each time we found additional problems , " the executive says . In the card reader , the card with the entire fingerprint in two dimensions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a scanner . But if one presses a finger on the glass plate , problems develop . The ridges near the fingernail are farther away from the scanner than those in the center of the fingertip . Pressing the finger down on the glass plate flattens out some of the ridges . And last but hardly least , a fingerprint is left on the glass that has to be meticulously cleaned off before the next finger can be read . " About a year and a half ago I told everybody to stop building gear that involved touching surfaces and to build a unit that could read a free-floating finger , " Mr. Schiller says . The key was a small , low-powered laser scanner that can measure to a fraction of a millimeter the height of the ridges and depths of the valleys on a finger , nail edge to nail edge , tip to crease , even if the finger isn ' t in the exact same position each time . THE RIDGE READER , as it ' s called , is in limited production and costs about $3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost , " we ' ve got a backlog of $7. 5 million , " he adds . Much of this interest is from European governments and companies that want the machines to verify that an individual is authorized to enter a facility . Fingermatrix isn ' t without problems . Although it is experimenting with fingerprint verification of credit cards , Mr. Schiller says the cost of the ridge reader will have to come down to $1 , 200 or less to open such markets . And , although it has $6 million in the bank , he says , Fingermatrix could use a well-heeled corporate partner . Then there ' s competition . Even though Fingermatrix claims it ' s the only U.S. company in the field , Nippon Electric Co. of Japan and De La Rue Co . PLC of Britain also are working on automated fingerprint reading systems . But Mr. Schiller is optimistic about his product . With obvious pride , he asks a visitor to poke a finger into one of the ridge readers . A few seconds later a fingerprint card with a reproduction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearby machine . The days of a policeman or a plant security guard inking a person ' s fingers and pressing them onto a card appear to be numbered .
