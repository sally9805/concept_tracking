THE LETTERS OF VIRGINIA WOOLF , VOL . VI : 1936-1941 Edited by Nigel Nicolson and Joanne Trautmann ; Harcourt Brace Jovanovich ; 556 pages ; $19.95 <P> " The art of letter writing , " Virginia Woolf wrote in 1930 , " has now reached a stage , thanks to the penny post and telephone , where it is not dead-that is the last word to apply to it-but so much alive as to be quite unprintable . The best letters of our time are precisely those that can never be published . " <P> How wrong she was , especially in her own case . Granted , she had a point about the stylistic changes since Horace Walpole or , later , those Victorian worthies enshrined in three-decker " Lives and Letters . " Vanished are the leisurely epistles addressed to a quasi-public circle of acquaintances ( and , between the lines , to posterity ) ; the 20th century goes elsewhere for its literary entertainment and journalism . In all of Woolf 's 3,710 collected letters-here rounded off in the last of six stout volumes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to paint a scene or describe great events ; even wars are kept to the background : " I write with the usual air raid going on ; distant droning ; a bomb now and then . " <P> Modern letters are hasty and utilitarian , usually meant for one pair of eyes only . But by that token the best of them , like Woolf 's , are also vibrant with immediacy , intimacy and often indiscretion ( " Why , " she asks , " is it so pleasant to damn one 's friends ? " ) . With her aristocratic sense of decorum she may have felt that their very privacy was what made them unpublishable . If so , she failed to reckon on this age 's voracious , ransacking appetite for all that is private in a writer 's life . As significant as her novels may be in the canon of modernist fiction , what really makes her writing live today-and what largely accounts for the current Virginia Woolf boom in publishing-is the vividness of personality in her nonfiction . When her letters and memoirs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with two to go ) , we may , as Editor Nigel Nicolson says , " be able to know Virginia Woolf better than we can know almost any other person of this century . " <P> Her deeper , more solemn reflections on art and life she saved for her diary . In her letters she is determinedly light , at times kittenish ; but she gives full play to her quick eye , sharp tongue and mocking sense of social comedy . An unfavorite cousin 's face reminds her of a " mandrill 's behind . " T.S . Eliot 's poem Ash Wednesday she greets as " Tom 's hard-boiled egg . " She describes avoiding an encounter with Ethel Smyth , the doughty , pipe-smoking feminist and composer who became infatuated with her : " I could not face her , though she was passing our door . Her letters sound as if she was in a furious droning mood , like a gale , all on one note . "                @ @ @ @ @
