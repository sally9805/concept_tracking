Benjamin Ruggiero  --  " Lefty Guns " to the mobsters he hung around with in New York City 's Little Italy  --  always remembered a conversation . No one knew that better than FBI Undercover Agent Joseph D. Pistone as he sat with Lefty , his Mafia chief and partner , in Nathan 's in Miami Beach one morning in 1980 . Several months before , Pistone had borrowed a white yacht from a fellow agent for an oceangoing party to impress Lefty and his Mafia pals . A girlfriend 's rich brother had provided the boat , Pistone explained . Now an unhappy Lefty was looking at a page of TIME with a picture of the very same yacht : it had been used by the FBI in the Abscam scandal to help catch several crooked Congressmen accepting bribes from agents posing as rich Arabs . <P> " Lefty , that 's not the same boat , " a wary Pistone insisted . Lefty was adamant : " Tell me about this boat . How did we get on this boat ? " Thinking fast , Agent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pointed out that if they had partied on a fed boat , they had been a lot smarter than the Congressmen : they had not been caught . " We 're sitting here , Left . We beat those FBI guys . " <P> It was probably the closest Pistone came to being unmasked and " whacked " ( killed ) during the five years that he posed as Jewel Thief Donnie Brasco with the Bonanno and Colombo crime families . When he emerged from under cover in 1981 , he was closer than any previous outsider to the inner sanctum of the Mafia . <P> His upcoming book Donnie Brasco : My Undercover Life in the Mafia ( New American Library ; $18.95 ) , written with Richard Woodley , reveals the full extent of his dangerous voyage into the underworld . Pistone lived with mobsters , gained their trust and came close to being initiated as a wise guy  --  a " made " Mafioso . He helped arrange business deals between crime families in different parts of the country and was the subject of three Mob-style tribunals , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resulted in a contract on his life . " In the Mafia , it 's always someone you know real well who kills you , " says Pistone , 48 , a tall , swarthy , bearded man with the build of an athlete . <P> Danger still lurks : the Mafia commission put out a $500,000 contract on Pistone 's life , forcing him and his long-suffering family to live under an assumed name somewhere in New Jersey . Pistone , who left the FBI in 1986 , is no longer protected by the agency but carries a .38-cal. pistol at all times . The Mob has reason to rage at the former agent : his daring double life was instrumental in gaining more than 100 federal convictions of organized-crime members . He was a key witness in the " pizza connection " case involving Sicilian heroin importers , as well as the 1986 Mafia commission trial in New York City . <P> Of equal importance , Pistone exposed the degree to which Government crime- busting efforts have weakened the Mafia , says Ronald Goldstock , director of the New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which once ran thorough security checks on any stranger , simply lacked the " discipline and internal controls " to unmask the agent , he says . <P> Pistone shows the Mafia as holding a disregard for human life that is terrifyingly amoral . As a wise guy , Pistone quotes Lefty as saying , " you can cheat , you can steal , you can kill people  --  legitimately . You can do anything you want , and nobody can say anything about it . "
