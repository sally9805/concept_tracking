You can bank on this : Milos Forman will never make a movie called The Milos Forman Story . Though the plot is dramatic enough  --  early renown in his native Czechoslovakia , exile in cultural limbo , the struggle of starting over in a new land with a new language  --  the climax does not ring true . It is too improbable : a smash hit and Oscars galore for his second American film , One Flew over the Cuckoo 's Nest ( 1975 ) , more profits and honors with last year 's Amadeus . Sorry , pal . Send the script to Sly Stallone . <P> Now consider these plots . A wily misfit takes on the mind benders in an Oregon psychiatric hospital ( Cuckoo 's Nest ) . Hippies raise their voices , and a little hell , against the Viet Nam War ( Hair , 1979 ) . A black man is driven by righteousness to lead an armed revolt against white America ( Ragtime , 1981 ) . A great but graceless composer battles the musical establishment of Old Vienna ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individualist is forever butting his head against the walls of official power and getting bashed for his pains . These parables of dreams defeated hold echoes of tales from Forman 's compatriots in dark absurdity , Franz Kafka , Milan Kundera and Tom Stoppard . They are hardly the stuff of Hollywood dreams . <P> Yet much about Forman and his films mirrors the spirit of America . Like any true Hollywood director , he works on the grand scale , in broad , confident strokes . Energy , not nuance , informs every frame . And like any true immigrant with a success story , Forman is grateful to his adoptive country . " For me , " he says , " there was only one place to go if I could n't live in my own country : America . It is a country of immigrants . There is such a tolerance for the foreign and the unfamiliar . America continues to amaze me . " <P> Born 53 years ago , in Caslav , Czechoslovakia , Forman was already a significant cinema voice before his arrival in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 1960s with a trio of wry social comedies : Black Peter , Loves of a Blonde and The Fireman 's Ball . But in 1968 the Prague Spring ended abruptly to the rumble of Soviet tanks , and shortly thereafter Forman went to New York City to shoot his first American film , the gentle , generation-gap comedy Taking Off . " I 've never been political , " he insists , " not in Czechoslovakia , not in this country . But after the commercial failure of Taking Off , I did n't have money to take a plane home , so I asked the Czech government if they 'd bring me back . And they fired me . " Sacked by an entire country ! There was nothing to do but start from scratch in the U.S. <P> Fortunately , Forman had studied his new subject , America and its movies , like a scholar lover . " I knew America by way of the films I 'd seen growing up , " he recalls . " I had a kind of mythical vision of the country , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so many things about America are larger than life that it was a more accurate vision about things than you might think . " Forman 's early years in New York City gave him glimpses of New World generosity ( " The manager at the Chelsea Hotel was very relaxed about the rent " ) and mendacity . " In America , " he says expansively , " there 's room for lots of dishonesty in the film business . "
