Is Britain depressed and divided ? Is it buoyantly forging ahead ? Or is it simply muddling through ? As the country launched into a 24-day parliamentary- election campaign last week , the portraits that political leaders painted of their country were starkly different  --  and the conflicting images at once turned into political battle flags . To the strains of Brahms ' Fourth Symphony in London 's Queen Elizabeth Conference Center , Neil Kinnock , the leader of the opposition Labor Party , strode onto the podium to describe a joyless , divided Britain , an " economically and socially disabled " country afflicted with Dickensian misery . Two hours later , at Conservative Party headquarters near Westminster Abbey , Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher , at the helm for the past eight years , evoked a very different nation , one with " revived spirit and restored reputation , " a land that could boast of being Western Europe 's " fastest-growing economy . " The previous day , Britain 's third political force , the Social Democratic-Liberal Party Alliance , had outlined a more subdued picture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and human costs to be intolerable . Their program , said S.D.P. Leader David Owen , was the " achievable dream . " <P> Thatcher , 61 , had chosen June 11 as polling day to ride an evident swelling of Conservative Party strength . When she made the decision to take the country to the ballot box 13 months before the end of her five-year term , her party held a 13% lead over Labor in the polls . By the time the campaign got under way last week , the margin had shrunk , with polls showing the Conservatives at around 42% to Labor 's 33% . The Alliance hovered at 25% . <P> Despite her lead , Thatcher is vulnerable , especially at a time when the British electorate has turned volatile and unpredictable . That condition has been linked by a Leeds University research center to the growing role of television in election campaigns . Moreover , Britons seem less inclined to follow a traditional pattern of voting along class lines , and they now have three rather than two major parties from which to choose . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both the most respected and the least liked of the main party leaders . While supporters regard the Prime Minister with something approaching awe , opponents like to caricature her as a hectoring nanny or , worse , a leader insensitive to the needs of the poor and the unemployed . At 10.9% , or 3 million people , the number of jobless , for example , is up dramatically from the 4.3% , or 1.1 million , when Thatcher took over in 1979 . Labor Leader Kinnock calls the unemployment situation a " lead weight of misery dragging down the British economy . " Thatcher 's attitude , he said last week , would lead Britain to have " beggars in the street and young boys on the run in the city , to people dying for lack of warmth in their own homes . " The Church of England and even some patrician Tory leaders have become persistent critics of Thatcher 's social policies , particularly in education and health care .                  @ @ @
