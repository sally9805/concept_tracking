The disclosure contradicts a repeated assertion by William L. Brown , chairman of the bank , that the reason for the bank ' s failure to comply with the currency reporting requirements was that it was unaware of them until 1984. // Earlier this month the Bank of Boston pleaded guilty to failure to report $1. 2 billion in cash transfers with Swiss banks from 1980 to 1984 and was fined $500 , 000 , a record amount. // <> <> Chairman ' s Remarks on Filing // Mr. Brown said at a news conference on Feb. 11 that the bank had simply failed to notice the regulations in the Federal Register , and he said that in June 1984 , " as soon as we had determined that these reports were required to be filed , we did so . " To underscore his point , Mr. Brown held up a copy of the Federal Register showing how many regulations it contained and how small the print was. // The regulation , intended to curb money laundering by organized crime , requires banks to report all cash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ banks . It went into effect in 1980. // But officials in the Treasury Department and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency said today that in August 1982 , Daniel Dormer , the vice president of the Bank of Boston for coin and currency , was told of the bank ' s failure to file the necessary reports with Treasury authorities. // The officials said the Treasury Department then referred the matter to the Comptroller ' s office for a full review of the bank ' s compliance with the reporting rules for foreign and domestic transactions. // In September 1982 , during the review , the officials added , examiners from the Comptroller ' s office again pointed out to Mr. Dormer the bank ' s lack of compliance. // Mr. Dormer then pledged that he would bring the Bank of Boston into compliance , the officials said . Despite his promise , the bank sent a total of $210 million in cash back and forth to the Swiss banks in 1983 and 1984 , without reporting these transactions to the Government. // A similar account of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ H. Joe Selby , the Acting Comptroller of the Currency , to Representative Carroll Hubbard Jr. , a Kentucky Democrat and chairman of the House Subcommittee on General Oversight and Investigations. // <> <> Name Unmentioned in Letter // Mr. Selby ' s letter did not mention Mr. Dormer by name , but it said , " The Treasury Department had been in contact with the officer in charge of currency operations at F.N.B. of Boston who had told the Department of Treasury that he was ' not completely familiar with the provisions of the Bank Secrecy Act regulations. ' " // The letter went on to say that the examiners found that the bank was unfamiliar " with the regulations concerning international transactions. " // " Corrective action was promised by the bank , " the letter added. // A spokesman for the Bank of Boston , Barry Allen , said today that he would not comment " on any conversations that may or may not have taken place " in 1982. // Mr. Dormer did not return phone calls made to him at the bank today. // Mr. Allen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1982 report , had only pointed out violations in the bank ' s domestic reporting , not its international transactions . Mr. Allen said the bank " is shocked and disappointed that the Comptroller has seen fit to imply that his office brought to the attention of top management and directors of the bank the failure to report international transactions. " // In a related development , Representative Fernand St Germain , Democrat of Rhode Island and chairman of the House Banking , Finance and Urban Affairs Committee , said today that his panel would begin extensive hearings on the Bank of Boston on March 20 in Boston. // <> <> Topics of Committee ' s Inquiry // He said the hearings would look into the bank ' s large unreported international cash transfers , its admission that it may have been unwittingly used by Boston ' s organized crime family to launder money and the role of the Comptroller ' s office in reviewing the bank. // Expressing " dissatisfaction " with the performance of the Comptroller ' s office , Mr. St Germain said it appeared that the Comptroller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until alerted by other Government agencies in 1982 , despite annual examinations. " // He continued , " More important , it appears that the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency failed to provide in a timely fashion special assistance sought by the enforcement division of the Treasury , which was trying to track the currency transactions at the bank in the fall of 1982. " // The Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations has also said it will hold hearings on the Bank of Boston later this spring. // <> <> Accounts at Brokerage Firm // In still another development , the legal counsel for Cowen &; Company , a New York-based brokerage firm , acknowledged today that the Angiulo family , Boston ' s criminal syndicate , held nine accounts with the firm. // Two weeks ago , when it was reported that in 1982 the Angiulos had purchased $270 , 000 worth of cashier ' s checks from the Bank of Boston payable to Cowen &; Company , the manager of its Boston office , Robert M. Jaffe , denied that the firm had accepted any money from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who asked not to be named , said the Securities and Exchange Commission was now examining the accounts held by the Angiulos . He also said their accounts had been brought to Cowen &; Company by Mr. Jaffe when he moved over from E. F. Hutton &; Company five years ago . But he insisted that the commissions that Cowen &; Company earned from the Angiulos ' accounts were " peanuts. " // Cowen &; Company , a privately owned concern , has offices in 16 cities and says it is among the top 30 brokerage firms in terms of capital. //
