The Reagan Administration has long claimed that many of the arms used by rebel forces in El Salvador are supplied by the Marxist-led Sandinista regime in Nicaragua . Washington justifies its support of the antigovernment contra forces largely as a way to stanch this flow . Last week a former CIA analyst made the unsettling charge that for the past three years the agency has been unable to produce hard evidence that such shipments are still occurring . <P> David MacMichael , 56 , who until April 1983 served as a CIA estimates officer specializing in Central American and Caribbean affairs , claims that intelligence reports of cross-border arms shipments " fell off to nothing " after the failure of the Salvadoran guerrillas ' " final offensive " in the spring of 1981 . Now , he says , he believes the Administration has " systematically misrepresented Nicaraguan involvement in the supply of arms to Salvadoran guerrillas to justify its efforts to overthrow the Nicaraguan government . " Secretary of State George Shultz says of MacMichael , " He must be living in some other world . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
