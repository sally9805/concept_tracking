" Bienvenido ! trumpeted Diario 16 , a Madrid daily , in joyous welcome . To the applause of hundreds who had gathered at Madrid 's Barajas Airport , Iberian Airlines Flight No. 952 touched down safely at 8:30 one morning last week with its priceless cargo . Stepping from the plane , Spanish Culture Minister Iigo Cavero emotionally proclaimed : " The last exile has returned home today . " <P> The jubilant occasion was the repatriation of Guernica , Pablo Picasso 's stark protest against the savagery of war , which had come to symbolize Spanish hopes for democracy .

The <P> Spanish civil war had already begun , and when German bombers supporting General Francisco Franco 's fascist forces leveled the Basque town of Guernica , Picasso made the act the theme of the painting . After Franco 's forces won the war , Picasso-who never returned to Spain as a protest against the Franco dictatorship-decreed that Guernica not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been restored . Picasso died in 1973 , two years before Franco . <P> In June , Picasso 's lawyer and heirs agreed that Spain was now sufficiently democratic to meet his wishes . Under tight security , the painting was transferred from New York 's Museum of Modern Art , where it had hung since 1939 , to Madrid 's Prado Museum .

Guernica will be formally unveiled on Oct. 25 , the centenary of Picasso 's birth .
