Many writers are turning to acting for fun and profit <P> " A writer must write what he has to say , not speak it , " said Ernest Hemingway . But times change and so do writers . If The Old Man and the Sea were published today , Papa would probably play the old man-and perhaps the fish too . And if he did not , no doubt Norman Mailer would volunteer for the role , and perhaps such other aspiring actor-writers as George Plimpton , James Leo Herlihy or Jerzy Kosinski would audition . Nowadays it is almost as fashionable for writers to act as it is for actors to write . In recent months , filmgoers have seen Mailer get violently murdered in Ragtime and Herlihy shoot both his daughter and himself in Four Friends . They have watched Reds in wonderment as Plimpton tries to seduce Diane Keaton and Kosinski helps guide the Russian Revolution . " It has become a trend , " says Ragtime Director Milos Forman . " Writers have a hidden affection for show business . " <P> Writers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; Shakespeare and Molire learned their craft on the boards performing in their own plays . It can also be , and often is , argued that writing is a form of acting . " I act all my parts when I write a play , " observes Arthur Miller ( Death of a Salesman , A View from the Bridge ) . Miller says that he would probably have become a player if he had failed as a playwright . " I well could have , " he says . " Some people think I 'm pretty good . " <P> But never before have so many writers actually stepped upon a stage or gone before the cameras . In months to come , John Irving will be seen as a wrestling coach in the film version of his novel The World According to Garp , Herlihy will play the king of the hobos in a new play by California Playwright Henry Murray , and Novelist and Screenwriter John Sayles will take Plimpton 's cue and assume the role of seducer in a film titled Lianna . <P> The reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other movie trends . Kosinski 's explanation is probably as good as any : television talk shows have turned writers into market able stars , recognizable to even the nonliterary . " Our photographs are every where , " he maintains . " I have a portfolio that rivals Brando 's . I 'm routinely stopped by people who say , ' I saw you on a talk show . ' I 'm known . " More modestly he adds : " There are also some people who have read our books who will come to see us out of curiosity . "
