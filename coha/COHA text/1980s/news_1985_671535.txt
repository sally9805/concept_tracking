" Israel is shocked and outraged by these two new acts of senseless terror against innocent civilians , " a Foreign Ministry statement said. // " The terrorist attacks come against a background of declarations by the head of the P.L.O. , and those Arab states that support this organization , that these terrorists will cease terrorist operations outside of Israel . Israel will continue its struggle against terrorism in every place and at any time it sees fit . " <> <> Syrian Missiles in Lebanon // Meanwhile , Israeli analysts said Israel ' s ability to retaliate for the attacks had been limited by Syria ' s decision to move mobile surface-to-air missiles into Lebanon. // In the past , Israel has often retaliated for terrorist attacks abroad by bombing Palestinian guerrilla bases in Lebanon , regarding these as convenient " return addresses. " // To do so now , however , Israeli jets would have to penetrate the new curtain of surface-to-air missiles Syria has drawn over the Bekaa region in Lebanon , which could lead to an all-out war with Syria , the analysts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Tunisia last October , that too is no longer an option for retaliation . The analysts said new P.L.O. offices in Baghdad would not be easy to reach and were widely dispersed . This would seem to leave as the only option for retaliation a more surgical strike against specific individuals , the analysts said . <> <> A Political Statement // To appreciate the full Israeli quandary , officials said , it must be understood that the Syrian decision to deploy the SAM-6 and SAM-8 mobile batteries a few miles inside Lebanon , for the second time in a month , was as much a political statement as a strategic military maneuver. // It was apparently designed , Israeli officials say , to send Israel and the United States clear signals about Damascus ' s intentions to change some of the rules in the Middle East. // To begin with , said Itamar Rabinovich , an authority on Syria at Tel Aviv University , the Syrians are apparently trying to establish a new relationship with Israel in Lebanon after the Israeli withdrawal. // While Israel wants to hold onto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freedom to fly reconnaissance missions over the Syrian-controlled Bekaa , the Syrians want to reverse once and for all this free Israeli access to their neighboring client state . <> <> A Challenge to Israel // " By sending the missiles back , the Syrians are signaling Israel that they intend to reassert their hegemony over all of Lebanon and its airspace and to test Israel ' s willingness to resist this new situation , " Mr. Rabinovich said. // The Syrians are also indicating that no one in the region should consider them prey to American influence , the Israeli analysts said . Israeli officials now recognize that not only did they provoke Damascus by shooting down two Syrian MIG ' s over Syrian territory Nov. 19 , but they also compounded the situation by announcing two weeks later that thanks to American mediation Syria decided to remove the mobile batteries. // " The Syrians do not like to be depicted as being subject to either American or Israeli pressure , " a senior Israeli official said . " We should have kept the whole matter secret. " // In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sending a signal to the Arab world , and particularly King Hussein of Jordan , who is to arrive in Damascus on Saturday for a state visit , that if the Arabs stand firm they can get what they want from Israel. // " This move is very much directed at King Hussein , " said Abba Eban , chairman of the Defense and Foreign Affairs Committee of Parliament . " What Assad is saying is that we are the bosses , we create the situations to which others react , we are the dynamic initiating party in the Middle East , and don ' t think you can start making peace without us . " <> <> Options for Israel // Given this Syrian approach , the analysts said Israel had a number of options. // The first is to send Israeli aircraft to destroy the missile batteries , as Israel did in June 1982 , when it destroyed 19 Syrian SAM launchers in one afternoon. // But officials say this option has drawbacks . For the Israeli Air Force to destroy the Syrian mobile batteries requires it to use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ electronic countermeasures involved the use of decoy aircraft that prompted the Syrians to turn on their missile radar at the wrong time , or for too long a period , enabling Israeli aircraft to fire anti-radiation missiles down the radar beams . At the same time the Israelis used jamming devices to confuse the radar guidance of the Syrian missiles . <> <> Lessons of June 1982 // Israeli officials have no doubt that the Syrians and their Soviet backers have learned the electronic lessons of the June 1982 debacle . Israel , it is assumed , has also learned the lessons that the Syrians have learned and devised the appropriate electronic counter-countermeasures. // For Israel to use this sophisticated electronic intelligence in something less than an all-out confrontation would be a great waste , Israeli military sources said . Even more so if this technology were used to destroy mobile missile batteries , which , like a field of mushrooms , would immediately spring up anew. // In addition , if Israel starts destroying Syrian SAM-6 and SAM-8 launchers in Lebanon , the Syrians are almost certain to respond by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their own territory . Israel would have to destroy those missiles as well , and that would be act of war against Syria proper . This could lead to an all-out confrontation , for which the Israeli public has not been prepared. // " The Israeli public is in no mood for a full-scale war with Syria , " said Moshe Maoz , an expert on Syria at Hebrew University . " People here are still getting over Lebanon . " <> <> Playing Into Assad ' s Hands // Finally , for Prime Minister Shimon Peres of Israel to enter into a conflict with Syria now would be to play into Mr. Assad ' s hands , by disrupting whatever progress Israel has made in improving relations with Egypt and nurturing Jordan toward negotiations , Israeli analysts said. // With all of these constraints in mind , however , if Israel simply allows the new situation created by Syria to take hold , it will be paying a heavy price in its own long-term deterrent power , Mr. Rabinovich said. // Israeli leaders are now trying to negotiate between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to avoid flights over the Bekaa for now and to try collect the same data in other ways , probably through pilotless drones. // At the same time , they are quietly working through American mediators to persuade Damascus to pull back , while also warning the Syrians publicly and privately that if they fire at any Israeli planes Israel will have no choice but to react. // " We do have an ability to act , " Mr. Eban said , " so that action might not be necesssry - provided the Syrians understand that. " // For now the weather over Lebanon is cloudy and rainy , and reconnaissance flights have been curtailed , military sources said . But eventually the weather will break , and the unstable situation on the ground in Lebanon or Palestinian attacks will demand that Israel resume its reconnaissance or air strikes , analysts said. // Only then will it be clear which bad option Israel has chosen , officials said. //
