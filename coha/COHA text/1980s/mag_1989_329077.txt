As if following the path from Rome that was trod by missionaries of long ago , the envoys of the Holy See scored major triumphs in Eastern Europe last week . First , with the remarkable assent of the Kremlin , Pope John Paul II named a new bishop for Belorussia , a Soviet republic that borders Poland . It was the first such appointment in 63 years ; the region 's last Catholic bishop was sent to prison in 1927 . The Pontiff then named three new bishops and regularized the status of a fourth to give hard-line Czechoslovakia its fullest hierarchy since the Communists launched a postwar effort to liquidate Catholicism . Coming only one week after the Holy See established diplomatic ties with Poland , the latest moves point to a growing accommodation between the church and the officially atheistic regimes of the Soviet bloc . <P> In Minsk , capital of Belorussia , Tadeusz Kondrusiewicz , 43 , was named apostolic administrator ( acting bishop under direct Vatican jurisdiction ) , thus becoming the leader of the republic 's 2 million Catholics . Kondrusiewicz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been a priest only since 1981 . <P> In Czechoslovakia six of the nation 's 13 sees are now led by Rome-appointed bishops or apostolic administrators . Restoration of the hierarchy had been stalled for years because the regime wanted bishops tied to a Communist-front " peace " association . Rome refused  --  and finally prevailed . <P> The most dramatic church reforms have occurred in Lithuania . The Kremlin has permitted a nearly complete hierarchy , even though the Vatican refuses to recognize the U.S.S.R. 's 1940 annexation of Lithuania . In 1988 the regime restored the two top churchmen , who between them spent 53 years in internal exile . In March the Pope named three new bishops ( the first since World War II ) and two apostolic administrators , so that five of the six dioceses have resident leaders . <P> Lithuania 's Catholics have also regained church buildings , established their own bimonthly magazine and , as of three weeks ago , are producing a TV show that is seen each Sunday . The man responsible for the new religious freedoms , Mikhail Gorbachev , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay a historic visit to the Polish Pontiff . It would be the first meeting ever between a Pope and a Soviet leader .
