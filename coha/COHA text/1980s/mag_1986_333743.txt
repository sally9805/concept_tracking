As one who has always done her overbearing best to be a huge success , Media Diva Grace Jones decided to go for maximum splash when it came time to make the video for her new song , I 'm Not Perfect ( But I 'm Perfect for You ) . In the $250,000 video out this week , she gets her lanky legs waxed , dunks herself in a milk bath and even undergoes pseudo psychoanalysis with Guru Timothy Leary . Of course , Jones has always had a sizable appetite for fashion overstatement , so she did not shrink from slipping her 5-ft. 9-in. frame into a 30-ft. by 60- ft. dress . And she tops off the reckless excess with phantasmagoric headgear that looks like a co-creation by Medusa and Dr. Seuss . Proclaims Jones : " The audience sees me as a larger-than-life image they can worship  --  like a hero . " So there . And Liberace , babe , eat your heart out .                   @ @
