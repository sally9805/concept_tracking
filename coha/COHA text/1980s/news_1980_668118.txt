The greatest problem he had with his new boat was to consider it a cure for smoking . " If I buy this boat , " he said , much too loudly and much too often , " I am going to quit smoking . " His wife smiled quietly . His kid said , " Sure . " " No , I mean it , " he thundered injudiciously , trying to blast away the mountain of their skepticism . " If I buy this boat , I will never smoke on it . " Several things were going on here , you may be sure , not least of which was an attempt to weigh the odds in favor of his impulsive desire to own a new sailboat . Throw the butts into the bargain and any reasonable resistance got buried so fast and so deep that his personal debt structure and savings account hardly had a chance to cry out . In a neat quick convolution of logic , buying the boat had somehow become necessary to his quitting smoking . Though he was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even to accomplishing the spectacular cerebral feat of forgetting that roughly the same argument had produced an addition to the house , a sports car , swimming pool , and an assortment of exotic vacations . " When ? " said his wife . " When what ? " " When are you going to quit ? " Standing in the midst of the boat show , he held the smoldering weed before his eyes , believing for the moment that it was a vile thing , then stomped it dead on the floor as a gallant token of things to come . " When ? " said his wife again . " Why , " he said , " when the boat ' s delivered . " This gave him about six weeks time . Time to get ready , you see ; time to prepare psychologically for The Changing of The Ways . " Ah , immortality , " croons the inner brain of the smoker , " thy name is six weeks . " Now it is a peculiar relationship that exists between smoking and outdoorsiness in all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was so bad for you ( but after the WWII era when it was something less than patriotic not to smoke Camels or Lucky Strikes ) , lighting up a cigarette was a hearty punctuation mark to an adventure on land or sea . Sail a race , canoe down white water , hike 15 miles in the Appalachians , and what better way to underline the experience than with a trail of meandering smoke ? The orange eyes of an evening ' s leisure . Alas for the advance of medical research . Mark Trail has replaced his pipe with a carrot stick and some wheat germ . Light up now after a day of the Great Outdoors and someone - usually a reformed smoker - will sneer loud enough for you to overhear : " Look at him ! Comes out here to get some fresh air , and look what he does ! Fills his lungs up with that crud ! " Still , there are some left like George Breen . George has caught something like 15 bass this year , and remembers ceremonially toasting each with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of smokes , he knows , but you can catch two or even three bluefish before you ' ve earned any such reward . And as game rewards used to go , three good black ducks or bluebills were worth a smoke , but you needed half a dozen sea ducks . One goose would suffice , and for a single deer , bear , moose , turkey , or any larger game , you could smoke for the rest of the day . Thus were the sacrificial creatures of the earth memorialized by the American tobacco industry . And what of our sailor who spent $25,000 or thereabouts to purify his blood ? Well , things went fine for quite a while . Family aboard , he would sail days across the broad ocean , holing up evenings in snug harbors - some beaching , cocktail hour , supper . . . but , even to his amazement , no smoking . And back on land in the office , just the memory of of one of those amazing hours plunging along in a fresh wind , galloping in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bow - just such a memory would be enough for the strength he needed . But then it happened . He did not mean it to happen , but it happened . He had sailed the boat through one miserable day with a friend . And they had spent 12 hours through rain and wind and an eastern fog bank that would descend between squalls , white tearing squalls that blinded them and threw the boat , even under bare poles , dangerously close to several broaches . All day it took both of them to keep the boat going , and so when they landed that evening they had had nothing to eat or drink , no comforts of any kind . And what kind of evening must it have been for such a thing to happen ! His companion was a shameless smoker , and just as they turned up the dogleg into the long channel home , just as a genial sun broke out over a placid bay , just as a rum bottle was produced on deck , this snake of a friend of his took out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what the hell . . . It was , he now reflects , the most enjoyable cigarette he has ever smoked . But , oh , the suffering that ensued , that has since ensued . He might even have been able to give them up again except for a certain instrument in his cabin , a barometer in the shape of a Chelsea clock which , when opened , has space just large enough to conceal a package of cigarettes . And ever since that fateful calm after the storm , it has done just that . " Where are you going now ? " his good wife will ask him . " Just up to check the anchor , m ' dear . I think we ' re dragging . " " Nonsense , " says she ; " it ' s as calm as a mill pond in here . " " Well , I think I ought to check it anyway . " And up to the bow . No one watching . A few desperate puffs that take him back to sneaking butts in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Someone coming up . Crush the butt . Throw it over . Stagger back down the deck , reeling nowfrom the effects of a brutal blast of carbon monoxide . Oh well , he came so close this time he figures to try it again . And he has figured out just what he has to do to make it work : New boat . And this time he ' ll get one without a barometer .
