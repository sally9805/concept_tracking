It ' s simple enough , just this . Career-mother Barbara Baxley and career-daughter Laurie Kennedy are having a snack at a restaurant table , debating the pros and cons of marrying , having children , taking sex as it comes , settling for the satisfactions of having landed at the top of one ' s profession , and/or just plain running away from it all . Miss Baxley is sleek and smiling and catlike , with a voice like two wineglasses tipped together . She is also exceedingly swift with her replies . Miss Kennedy , being less experienced though not inexperienced , is more urgent , more earnest , more searching . In fact , having just fired off a barage of inquiries , she is actually about to phrase another. // " Mother , " she begins , " one more question - " She is not permitted to finish her One More Question . She is not allowed to fashion so much as another syllable . Before she can even gather breath for the effort , Miss Baxley has intercepted her by tossing her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accurate , all-purpose Answer , the Answer to all the questions that should never be asked , the Answer to all the questions for which there is no answer . It comes in a flash , though quietly : // " To get to the other side . " Now I do like that . So does the audience , after a few seconds ' consideration . The quick little exchange gets a laugh but it is what the trade calls a delayed laugh . First there is a sharp silence as the audience feels caught off base by an apparent non sequitur . Then , without too much effort and with increasing glee , theatergoers begin to send a ripple of acknowledgement across the auditorium . They ' ve figured out what Miss Baxley ' s doing , and what Miss Baxley ' s doing is fun . Having been drained by her daughter of such worldly wisdom as she does possess , she is telling the 28-year-old child that if there is really going to be one more question it might as well be " Why does a chicken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one she ' s prepared to answer , in any case. // And if the playful little bypass is fun , it ' s more than that . Its implications - the gap between the lines , the stammer at the heart of things , the tumble into uncertainty - is precisely what author Wasserstein means to write about . There ' s nothing doctrinaire about the attitudes explored in " Isn ' t It Romantic " unless it ' s doctrinaire to suggest that no , things aren ' t really very romantic anymore . Miss Wasserstein isn ' t interested in sitting behind the scenes playing trump cards ; she ' s much more interested in playing fair . And fair she is , even , in a manner of speaking , to Bob Gunton ' s professional office cad - we ' d have called him a lounge lizard when I was a boy - who is made utterly irresponsible but so candid about his irresponsibility that you become intrigued by the fact that he doesn ' t lie. // On to the girls , however ; they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ options have they , in this time of socio-sexual crisis ? Janie ( Alma Cuervo ) is overweight , Jewish , sweetly funny and genuinely devoted to the genuinely devoted young man with whom she will not share an apartment . " Martin , " she says to him in a sardonic effort to explain herself , " I ' m reflective and Rubenesque and my mother was a pioneer in modern dance . " Martin , in the appealing and sometimes forceful presence of Peter Riegert , pauses long enough to tilt her chin at a certain angle , place her brow in a certain light , to see if she ' ll come clear . She doesn ' t and she won ' t , fond as she is of him . " Sometimes I look at him and I think he ' s such a nice young boy I must be a nice young girl , " she murmurs to herself . Indeed , these two are so attractive together - in the writing , in the performing - that you find yourself rooting for the impossible . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Janie is a puzzle to the boy who loves her , she ' s a puzzle to herself as well . And , it would seem , philosophic enough about it , going off to her job at the Book of the Month Club. // Laurie Kennedy is over at Colgate Palmolive , first surrendering to Mr. Gunton ' s promise of nothing but assignations at the Ramada Inn , then ditching Mr. Gunton ( who , deeply suntanned and still oily , is very , very good ) for marriage with a chap we never meet and can ' t measure . Miss Baxley , who doesn ' t really think her offspring is going to " have it all " in her new arrangement , is glitteringly tart and fetchingly composed throughout . Success has been good for her , and let ' s not pretend otherwise . Three women , three ways of life that don ' t match , three reflections of a new world that isn ' t necessarily going to make everyone happy . With the exception of Janie ' s parents , who are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claims to our attention. // I said to start with , though , that I also had a doubt about what Miss Wasserstein is doing . It ' s a serious one , and it has nothing to do with the fact that our author goes insidey from time to time ( a complicated and rather tasteless jest that drops the name of the late " Babe " Paley is still lodged in my teeth ) or that the laughter she does inspire at the Marymount Manhattan Theater is often markedly girlish ( at least it was on the night I was there ) . Miss Wasserstein is a writer , she can be funny ( " My mother identifies with Jean Harris " ) , we do grow fond of her four or five sparring partners as they grope after happiness while a song on the soundtrack asks if we still believe in magic , " the magic in a young girl ' s heart . " The one thing I ' m not sure of is whether Miss Wasserstein is in any special sense a dramatist. // An explorer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On the 71st Street stage , four sizable sofas have been anchored in space , taking up most of the acting area . They are the acting area . On them , separate couples are going to pretend to dine at restaurant tables , to take the air on park benches , to shuck their clothing and tumble into foldaway beds. // And the first obvious thing about this structural design is that we are in for a sitdown play . Two schoolgirl friends will sit down to compare life-style notes . Two mothers will meet by chance and do much the same thing , allowing for the lapse of a generation . A boy will playfully resort to sign-language in an effort to get through to his reluctant girl . The office seducer will point out to his conquest how useful he is : of course his conquest will try to change him , of course she will fail , of course she will leave him , causing her to marry well and please her mother . And so on. // Now people do sit down in plays all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that in most plays the characters finally get up . They get up because they are infuriated , or because they are hurt , or because they are preoccupied with other and more urgent matters . Something stings them , something appalls them , something reminds them that life and the world are getting on with it and they ' d better get on with it , too . In short , they ' re stirred into action , and that ' s where at long last the excitement begins . Miss Wasserstein is not instinctively given , it would seem , to such sudden fevers or ultimate explosions . There is only one moment in her several dozen meetings when a threat of awkward , humiliating , dangerous tension all too briefly asserts itself . Miss Kennedy is angry with the coolly conquering Mr. Gunton , so angry that she is willing to make a break with him publicly , in the presence of several close friends . An alarm sounds ; it ' s the wrong time for her to make the effort ; there ' s going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t . Even as the atmosphere is beginning to give off a highly welcome crackle , it is also losing its momentum , dissipating its promise . The author seems to have no real affinity for armored clashes , by day or by night , and she ducks away from this one . Rather than alarm their friends , the two who are quarreling go off to do battle in private . Invariably Miss Wasserstein herself retreats into yet another inconclusive , ultimately gentle conversation . Result : her scenes , even the attractive ones , are all written at the same even pace ; they could be interchanged without harm ; a half-dozen could be dropped without altering the play ' s meaning much. // We are faced with an uninterrupted placidity of tone , with exchanges that blur into one another because they one and all open smoothly and end softly , with a theatrical architecture that is as horizontal as the sofas on which it rests . Plays are normally built vertically , out of an agonized reaching ; they spiral dizzily upward toward climaxes , ambitious as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' t really requre a stage . It would function exactly as well - perhaps even better - on paper , as a novel or a short story or an interpretative survey for a magazine . Indeed , if her characters didn ' t eat in restaurants rather more than most people do , I ' m afraid there ' d be no " play " here at all. // I stress the point not because there ' s any rigid formula that drama proper must sniff out and keep trailing - certainly there ' s no such clearly marked path in this transitional time we inhabit - but because there really ought to be a reason , and an urgent one , for casting material in one form rather than another . The question a writer should ask , I suppose , runs something like this : will the things I want to do work best on paper , where they can be read at the reader ' s own rate , or will they function better out loud , on a stage , most publicly , with the headlong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miss Wasserstein should think seriously about the future and about the particular literary form - whatever it may turn out to be - that is most congenial to her . She ' s too good not to get to the other side. //
