" All I want , " says the half-maddened character in Woody Allen ' s movie , Love and Death , ' clutching a square of grassy turf to his chest , " is a little piece of land . " John Smith , 62 , has his . It cost him $15 , and three months after planting it ' s sprouting peanuts and cabbage , onions and white potatoes , string beans and celery , squash and black-eyed peas , mustard greens and collards . " I ' m really not what you ' d call a farm boy , " says the heavy set Smith , his voice trailing behind him as he ambles through the trails of Boston State Hospital in Mattapan at a slow lope . " I ' m the kind of guy who believes in trying something . If you do something and it seems to work good , well then I ' ll try it myself to see if it works good . " Smith settles into a steel-backed chair placed underneath a large shady tree . " Sometimes I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says , " cause then I would know more about these farm-type things . " Farm-type things . Tomatoes pulled off the vine . Lettuce pulled from the ground . Basil snipped carefully for salads and sauces . Born and raised in Virginia , Smith says native-born Bostonians don ' t care much for gardening and aren ' t very good at it . But the patchwork of city vegetable gardens - springing up between buildings of housing projects in Roxbury , lying beneath a skyscraper in Chinatown , landscaped across the Fenway - prove him wrong . Boston has scores of victory gardens and community gardens . The 500-plot garden on the grounds of Boston State Hospital , bordered by American Legion Highway and Walk Hill street , is one of the largest and best maintained . " I come out here every day , " says Alan Farrar , 59 , gray haired with a cane , voice filled with a North Carolina drawl that still turns dogs into dawgs ' and daughters into dawtuhs . ' His 20-by-30- foot garden carriescantaloupe , watermelons , okra , collard greens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flat in a beach chair , shaded from the sun by his l976 lime green Dodge Dart , tilting his head sideways whenever a car passes - to see if he recognizes the driver . " I didn ' t say I worked in the garden every day , " he says . " I said I ' d be here every day . " The extensive Boston State Hospital gardens cover more than 7 acres anddraw gardeners from neighbohoods throughout Boston . But many of the gardeners are blacks born in the South or Midwest . " It ' s mostly country people , " says Kirby Jordan , a big , bearded man orginally from Georgia near the Alabama border . " City people don ' t want to be bothered with it . They say like this : " I can buy it cheaper than I can grow it . " Maybe so . After paying $15 to rent a 20-by-30 foot plot of land for a year , gardeners can expect to pay another $15 to get the land plowed and ready for planting . Then there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fencing if you want it , plus a a scarecrow or scraps of rags tied to string to scare away the birds . Farrar , the man from North Carolina lying in the beach chair , figures it cost him $150 to get his garden started last year . So far this year all he ' s eaten from it are mustard greens and turnip greens . " My husband thinks it ' s a pain in the neck , " said Barbara Moran , an office worker from Harvard , armed with a small three- pronged tool topped by an orange handle . " I go on and on about my tomatoes to people at work and they just go , Oh yes that ' s nice , that ' s very nice . ' " The gardens at Boston State Hospital grow so well that two years ago the gardeners held a senior citizen day , giving away vegetables to more than 100 elderly , and depositing bags of fresh vegetables at elderly housing projects throughout the surrounding area . Even pilfering doesn ' t bother the gardeners too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Most have learned to plant extra produce - some for the pilferers - the rest for the gardeners . For the men and women who work the small plots at Boston State Hospital , vegetable gardening makes enormous sense : It ' s outdoor recreation , its productive . For many it ' s a form of social recreation , like the boaters who gather at a marina and talk long into the evening about the weather and conditions on the water . The people the Mattapan gardeners can ' t understand are some amateur horticulturalists over at the Fenway . " All they grow are flowers , " says Jordan , with disdain . He utters a soft curse and adds : " You can ' t eat flowers . " Pointers for a late garden It is late in the season to begin a city vegetable garden , but there is still time for string beans , turnip greens , mustard greens and pole beans , according to John Smith , who supervises plantings at the Community Garden on the grounds of Boston State Hospital . Standing over straight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Legion Highway , Smith yesterday offered the following tips : - Plow the ground twice , putting lime in after the first plow and then turning it under . This helps plants grow faster and healthier . - Water early in the morning or late in the afternoon . If you water in the middle of the day and the sun is hot , the sun will scorch the plants . - Don ' t plant vegetables too close together . At least 18 inches apart for cabbage , for example , two inches apart for peanuts . - Fertilize three weeks after planting . Smith uses bone meal , placed in a trench running about 4 inches away from each row and then covered with earth . - Try scarecrows or pieces of rags and tinfoil tied to string and streteched along the garden perimeter to keep the birds away Some gardenersput branches over very young plants to hide them from marauding birds .
