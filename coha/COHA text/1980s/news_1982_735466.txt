txt The farmers of Owatonna , Minn. , do n't want to sell their corn and beans after harvesting them this fall . Prices are " so godawful poor , " one says , " it 's like giving them away . " The farmers of Hutchinson , Kan. , feel the same way about their wheat , as do the farmers in Diller , Neb. , about their milo . In fact , many have been reluctant to sell their crops for the past two or three years or even longer . Some North Dakota and Nebraska farmers still are holding on to grain grown in 1976 . Today , the Midwest is bloated with grain , and the U.S. is quickly running out of places to put it . There is space to store 18.9 billion bushels in this country , and by the end of this year 's harvest , nearly all of it will be full . Most of the available room is in such places as New York and Montana . far from where the grain is planted , processed or exported . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Iowa , Illinois , Nebraska and Kansas , farmers and grain elevators are short of space for hundreds of millions of bushels of grain . ' Months Became Years ' Instead of bins and silos , they plan to use airplane hangars , machine sheds , rail cars and barges , and some will just dump the excess grain on the ground and protect it from weather and animal damage with plastic tarps . " We kept on thinking , next month we 'll be able to sell the grain , but then the months became years and prices are worse than ever , " says Cecil Smith of Owatonna , Minn . He now gets less than $2 a bushel for his corn , " but you can hardly plant it for less than $2.75 , " he says . The lack of space worsens all the other troubles plaguing farmers . Farm income this year is expected to be the lowest since the Depression , and this burdensome supply is driving grain prices even lower . The corn harvest began last week in central Illinois , and prices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to find a place to put the crop . As space becomes tighter , grain elevators have increased their storage charge in recent weeks as much as 54% , to 40 cents a bushel . And the ever-growing piles of grain on the farm are teeming with bugs because farmers did n't prepare their crops for longterm storage . " All of this came about because farmers are so productive , " observes James Gill , director of market analysis for the Illinois Farm Bureau . " This is n't exactly the reward we were expecting . " Giving It Away There is n't much relief in sight . Exports are slipping for the first time since 1972 . Hog and poultry production is being cut , and the nation 's cattle herd is the smallest in nearly 10 years . A recent meeting of agricultural trade group leaders considered seriously , if Source : Agriculture Department briefly , a strategy of working off the surplus by giving away a free bushel of grain for every one purchased . To the farmers of the Midwest , there 's an irony to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we held it off the market , " says Dennis Hennerberg of Diller , Neb . The government thought so , too , and it has been lending farmers money since 1978 for the wheat and corn they agreed to store rather than sell . Today there are more than 2.1 billion bushels of gram in that reserve program , valued at more than $6 billion . When the government loans on that grain come due , farmers are forfeiting the grain rather than selling it to repay the loans , because prices are below the loan level . The Agriculture Department predicts it will have to assume $400 million worth of grain this year , and $600 million next year . " We 'd forfeit it , too , if we could , " an Agriculture Department economist says . " But we ca n't . " As a result , farmers , who traditionally have turned to the government for help in getting rid of surpluses , find themselves competing with the government for storage space . Michael Hennerfent of Gilson , Ill. , usually stores 10,000 bushels of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " but all they got in there now is that reserve corn , " he says . So he 's spending $19,000 to build a bin , an expenditure he can ill afford . A grain elevator manager explains , " The government is a better customer , because they contract to use the space for two years . They just let it sit . there . Farmers can pull theirs out at any time . " Grain analysts estimate that all the crops dumped outside or stored in unconventional warehouses will probably have a regular home by next March . " But that still does n't solve the problem . What will we do next year and the year after that ? " says Robert Swanson of the Kansas State Department of Agriculture . In the 1960s , the U.S. had a similar glut and was forced to store it in mothballed naval ships ; that surplus evaporated when the Soviet Union began importing billions of bushels of U.S. grain . But the U.S. sacrificed its stronghold in that country when it embargoed grain shipments to the U.S.S.R. for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fill the gap . No Bugs for Dinner As farmers and the government worry about how to handle the surplus , part of it is quietly disappearing anyway , but that in itself is a problem . More than 25% of the wheat and 80% of the corn stored on farms is infested with bugs , and they reproduce best when covered by piles of grain . " Farmers did n't fumigate or clean their grain before they stored it because they thought they 'd be selling it years ago , " says Charles Storey , one of the scientists at the U.S. Grain Marketing Research Laboratory who conducted a study of 8,000 bins in 27 states . The bugs do n't reach the dinner table because the infested grain is usually fed to livestock or the bugs are removed in the milling process . But they feed on the grain , reducing its nutritional content and its value . " Of course that 's the last way in the world you 'd want to get rid of your grain , " says a farmer in Bremen , Kan .
