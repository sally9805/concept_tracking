Lawrence , Sandersoff on the 30th floor , but turned down the long corridor in the opposite direction . Fred led the way around one turn to Room 3015 . He halted before the flush door . " Take a look at this door , Irene , " he demanded . " Tell me what you see . Or do n't see ! " She knew immediately what it was  --  she had read about it in the hotel trade magazine  --  but she could not deny him his moment of triumph . " It just looks like an ordinary door to me , " she said , shrugging . " No keyhole ! " he said . " Just that thing ... " He pointed to a narrow , metal-rimmed slot directly under the knob . Then he took a white plastic card from his jacket pocket . It was no larger than a credit card . " Magnetic , " he explained to Zoe . " The printed code is between two pieces of solid plastic . You ca n't see it . And no way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet there is n't . " " That 's wonderful , " she said . " Great security , " he said . " Practically eliminates break-ins . Who can pick a lock that does n't show ? " He fumbled a bit , then got the plastic card inserted into the slot . The bolt slid back , he turned the knob , opened the door and stood aside . " Welcome to my castle , " he said . The room was certainly larger , cleaner , and more attractively furnished than the rooms at the Hotel Granger . But it had the impersonality of all hotel rooms : everything designed to repel cigarette burns and glass stains , to require minimal maintenance . Pictures were bolted to the walls ; the base of the TV set was anchored to the floor . " Make yourself at home , " Fred said . " I got ta see a man about a dog . " He went into the bathroom , closed the door . Zoe moved slowly and cautiously . She removed her coat , folded it once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door . She sat down slowly in a high-backed armchair . She touched no surface . The Third Deadly Sin 41She heard the toilet flush . In a moment he came out of the bathroom , smoothing strands of rusty hair across his white scalp . " Well now , " he said heartily , " let 's get this show on the road . How about a shot of the world 's best brandy ? I never travel without it . " " You know what they say about alcohol ? " she said archly . " It increases the desire and decreases the performance . " " Lotta bullshit , " he said . " You wo n't have any complaints , little lady . " " Well . . . maybe just a sip . " " Atta girl . This 'll put lead in your pencil  --  if you had a pencil ! " They both laughed immoderately . She watched him take a pint bottle from the top dresser drawer . He poured her a small drink in a water glass and a larger one for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , she was deliberately busy with a compact mirror , poking at her wig . So he set the glass on the endtable next to the armchair . Then he sat on the edge of the bed . He turned to face her . " Say , " he said , " you would n't mind if I smoked a cigar , would you ? " " Of course not , honey , " she said . " I just love the smell of a good cigar . " " You sure , babe ? " he said doubtfully . " My wife does n't . " " I do , " she assured him . " Go right ahead . " So he stripped the cellophane from a cigar and lighted up , ! Duffing contentedly . He took the pillows from under the bedspread , propped them against the headboard . He removed his jacket and vest , took off his shoes . He loosened his tie , unbuttoned his collar . The fleshy neck , reddened , bulged free . Then he sat back against the pillows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his cigar in one hand , brandy in the other . " Oh boy , oh boy , oh boy , " he sighed . " This is the life . Daddy told me there would be nights like this , but he did n't tell me how lew and far between . Hey , sweetheart , why do n't you make yourself more comfortable ? " 42 Lawrence Sanders " I thought you 'd never ask , " she said , giggling . She stood , moved closer to the bed . She locked his eyes , but when she began to draw the side zipper of her dress slowly downward , his gaze followed that movement . The brandy and cigar were forgotten . He watched everything she did . She pulled the dress over her head , being careful not to dislodge her wig . She smiled at his expression , turned , walked away with an exaggerated wiggle . She folded the dress atop her trenchcoat . She turned to face him , hip-sprung , hands on her waist . She sucked in her stomach , thrust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side . " You like ? " she said coquettishly . " Wow , " he said shakily . " Oh wow , you 're really something . Old Fred really grabbed the brass ring tonight . Come here . " She stood next to the bed . He put his brandy on the bedside table . He touched the band of smooth white skin between bikini and stocking top . She turned back and forth , letting him stroke . " You 're driving me crazy , " she said throatily . She leaned over the bed , her face close to his . He reached up to touch the wig . She drew back . " Why do n't you take off all those clothes ? " she whispered . " I have to go make wee-wee and then I 'll come back to you . I 'll do anything you want . And I mean anything . " He made a grunting sound and reached for her . But she laughed , moved away . She picked up her shoulder bag , went to the bathroom door , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her fingers at him , disappeared inside . She locked the door , worked swiftly . She took off sandals , garters , stockings , lingerie . She relieved herself . When she flushed the toilet , she used two sheets of toilet paper to press the tank lever , then watched as the tissue went swirling away . She opened her bag , made her preparations . Then she just waited , staring at her image in the medicine cabinet mirror . After a while she recognized herself . She stayed in there until she heard his call : The Third Deadly Sin 43 " Irene ? What 's keeping you ? " She unlocked the door , opened it a crack , peeked out . He had turned off the overhead light , turned on the bedside lamp . The bedspread and blankets had been thrown off . He was lying back . The sheet was pulled up to his waist . His naked torso was haired and puffy . His plump breasts made almond-shaped shadows . He was smoking his cigar . She draped one of the hotel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ switched off the bathroom light . " Ready or not , " she said lightly , " here I come . " ' He turned to stare at her naked body moving into the cone of lamplight . " Ah Jesus , " he breathed . She went around to the right side of the bed , away from the table and the lamp . She bent over him , smiling tenderly . He turned to the left to put his cigar in the ashtray . She lowered her arm , let the towel fall away . Handling the Swiss Army Knife like a dagger , she plunged the big blade into the left side of his fat neck and sawed back toward her . He made a sound , a gargle , and his heavy body leaped onvulsively from the bed . Blood spouted in streams , gobbets , a flood that sprayed the air with a crimson fog . It soaked the bed , dripped onto the floor . Zoe Kohler threw back the sheet , exposing his pulpy abdomen , veined legs , his flaccid penis and testicles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . With bloodied , slippery hand , she drove the knife blade again and again into his genitals . No triumph or exultation in her face . Not grinning or yowling , but intent and businesslike . Saying loud with each stab , " There . There . There . " Former Chief of Detectives Edward X. Delaney had two methods of eating sandwiches . Those he categorized as " dry " sandwiches  --  such as roast beef on white or what he termed an interracial sandwich , ham on bagel  --  were eaten while seated at the kitchen table . The top was spread with the financial section of the previous day 's New York Times . The meal finished , crumbs and newspaper were crumpled up and dumped into the step-on garbage can under the sink . " Wet " sandwiches  --  such as potato salad and pastrami on rye , with hot English mustard , or brisling sardines with tomato and onion slices slathered with mayonnaise  --  were eaten while standingbent over the sink . Finished , Delaney ran the hot water and flushed the drippings away . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife , Monica . She never ceased in her efforts to persuade him to adopt more civilized eating habits , even if it was only a midday snack . Delaney tried to explain to her , as patiently as he could , that he had spent thirty years of his life with the New York Police Department , most of them in the Detective Division . He had become addicted to sandwiches since , considering the long , The Third Deadly Sin 45brutal hours the job demanded , sandwiches consumed while working were usually the only sustenance available . " But you 're retired now ! " she would cry . " Habits are habits , " he would reply loftily . Actually , he loved sandwiches . One of the recurring fantasies of his increasingly onerous retirement was the dream that he might one day compile a slim volume , Chief Delaney 's Sandwich Book . Who had a better right ? Who but he had discovered the glory of cold pork and thinly sliced white radish on pumper-nickel ? On the evening of March 19th , Monica Delaney , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Detective Sergeant Abner Boone , was preparing a buffet for fourteen members of her women 's group . The dinner was to be preceded by a psychologist 's lecture followed by a general discussion . Then the buffet would be served . " We 're having avocado and cottage cheese salad , " Monica said firmly . " Bibb lettuce , cherry tomatoes , cucumbers , little green peppers . There 's plenty for you . And if you do n't like that , there 's a cheese-and-macaroni casserole ready to pop in the oven , or the cold chicken left over from last night . " " Do n't you worry about me , " he advised . " I ate so much yesterday , I 'd really like to take it easy tonight . I 'll just make a sandwich and take that and a bottle of beer into the den . I assure you , I am not going to starve . " In his methodical way , he began his preparations early , before Rebecca Boone arrived and the women got busy in the kitchen . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two sandwiches from what was available . One was white meat of chicken with slices of red onion and little discs of pitted black olives . With a small dollop of horseradishsauce . The second was a crude construction of canned Argentine corned beef , the meat red and crumbly , with cucumterslices . On rye . He wrapped both sandwiches in aluminum foil , and thrust them in the back of the refrigerator to chill . When Rebecca arrived , and soon after that the front doorbell46 Lawrence Sandersbegan to ring , Edward X. Delaney hastily retrieved his sandwiches , took a bottle of cold Lowenbrau Dark , and hustled out of the kitchen . He retired to his den , closing the heavy door firmly behind him . The desk in the study was covered with papers , receipts , letters , vouchers , open notebooks . For the past two weeks , Delaney had been spending a few hours each day working on his federal income tax return . Actually , the Chief was doing the donkey work , assembling totals of income , expenses , deductions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his second wife . Monica was the widow of Bernard Gilbert , a victim of Daniel Blank , a random killer Delaney had helped apprehend . The multiple homicides had been brought to an end right there in the room where Delaney was now seated , headquarters for OperationLombard . A year after his first wife , Barbara , had died of kidney infection , the Chief had married Monica Gilbert . He had two children , Edward , Jr. , and Elizabeth , both now married , Liza with twin boys . Monica had two young girls , Mary and Sylvia , now away at boarding school , preparing for college . Monica 's first husband , Gilbert , had been a CPA and tax accountant , and she had taken courses to enable her to assist him in what had started as a kitchen business . She had kept up with annual changes in the tax laws . Delaney was happy to leave to her the task of preparing the final return that each year seemed to become longer and more complex . Since he did n't want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up a wheeled typewriter table . He removed his old Underwood , setting it on the floor with an effort that , he was pleased to note , did n't elicit a grunt . He then lifted the leaves of the table , locked them in position , and spread the wide surface with newspaper . He unwrapped his sandwiches , uncapped the beer , and settled down in his worn swivel chair . He took a bite of the corned beef sandwich . Washed it down with a swallow of dark beer . Then he grunted . The Third Deadly Sin 47He donned his reading glasses and set to work , oblivious to the sounds of talk and laughter in the living room outside his door . When you had worked as long as he had in a crowded detective squad room , you learned the trick of closing your ears . You can shut your mouth and your eyes ; why not your ears ? He worked steadily , doggedly . He added up their total annual income , for Monica had brought to their marriage an annuity her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modest stock portfolio that yielded good dividends although prices were down . Edward X. Delaney had a generous pension , income from investments in high-yield , tax-exempt New York City bonds which  --  thank God  --  had not defaulted , and he had applied for early Social Security . Between them , husband and wife , they were able to live comfortably in a wholly owned refurbished brownstone right next to the 251st Precinct house . Still , a combined income that would have allowed them to live in comparative luxury ten years ago was now being cruelly eroded by inflation . It had not yet seriously affected their way of life , since neither was profligate , but it was worrisome . Delaney , going over his check disbursements , saw how much had gone in cash gifts to Eddie , Jr. , to Liza , and to Liza 's children . And how much had gone to clothing and educating Mary and Sylvia . He did not regret a penny of it , but still . . . By the time the two younger girls were ready for college @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ university education would probably be $50,000 or more . It was discouraging . He finished the corned beef sandwich . And the beer . He listened carefully at the door to the living room . He heard the voice of a woman he believed to be the lecturing psychologist . Judging the time was right , he darted out the door leading to the kitchen . Moving as quietly as he could , he grabbed another lx  --  er from the refrigerator , a can of Schlitz this time , and hurried back to his study . He pushed his glasses atop his head . He popped the beer , took a swallow . Took a bite of the chicken % , uulwich. lie sat slumped , feet up on the corner of his desk . He thought48 Lawrence Sandersabout the children , all the children , Monica 's and his . And he thought sadly of the one child they had together , an infant son who died from a respiratory infection after three months of fragile life . The coffin had been so small . After a while , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sounds of conversation and vociferous debate coming from the living room . He guessed the lecture was over , the general discussion period was concluding , and soon the avocado and cottage cheese salad would be served . He had been wise to avoid that ! The door to the living room opened suddenly . A young woman started in . She saw him , drew back in alarm and confusion . " Oh ! " she said . " I 'm sorry . I thought this was ... " He lumbered to his feet , smiling . " Perfectly all right , " he said . " What you 're probably looking for is out in the hallway , near the front door . " " Thank you , " she said . " Sorry to disturb you . " He made a small gesture . She closed the door . He sat down again , and to reassure himself , to convince himself , he tested his skills at observation . He had seen the woman for possibly five seconds . She was , he recited to himself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 5 ' 6 " tall , weight : 120 , blondish hair shoulder-length , triangular face with long , thin nose and pouty lips . Wearing gold loop earrings . A loose dress of forest-green wool . Digital watch on her left wrist . Bare legs , no stockings . Loafers . A distinctive lisp in her voice . A Band-Aid on her right shin . He smiled . Not bad . He could pick her out of a lineup or describe her sufficiently for a police artist to make a sketch . He was still a cop . God , how he missed it . He sat brooding , wondering not for the first time if he had made an error in resigning his prestigious position as Chief ofThe Third Deadly Sin 49Detectives and opting for retirement . His reason then had been the political bullshit connected with the job . Now he questioned if the political pressures in such high rank were not a natural concomitant . The fact that he could not endure them might have been a weakness . Perhaps a stronger man could have done all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plots of a city government of ambitious men and women . And when he could not resist , then compromising to the smallest degree compatible with survival . Still , he wasHis reverie was interrupted by a light , tentative tap on the door leading to the kitchen . " Come in , " he called . The door opened . Edward X. Delaney struggled to his feet , strode across the room , shook the other man 's proffered hand . " Sergeant ! " he said , smiling happily . A few minutes later , Detective sergeant Abner Boone was seated in a cracked leather club chair . Delaney moved his swivel chair so he could converse with his visitor without the desk being a barrier between them . The Chief had made a quick trip to the busy kitchen to bring lack a bucket of ice and a bottle of soda water for the sergeant , who was an alcoholic who had not touched a drop in two years . Delaney mixed himself a weak highball , straight rye and water . " I dropped by to pick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're still eating . I hope I 'm not disturbing you , sir . " " Not at all , " the Chief said genially . He motioned toward his littered desk . " Tax returns . I 've had enough for one night . Tell me , what 's the feeling about the new PC ? " For about fifteen minutes the two men talked shop , gossiping alxiut Departmental matters . Most of the information came from Moore : who had been promoted , who transferred , who retired. 50 Lawrence Sanders " They 're putting the dicks back in the precincts , " he told Delaney . " The special squads just did n't work out . " " I read about it , " the Chief said , nodding . " But they 're keeping some of the squads , are n't they ? " " A few . That 's where I am now . It 's a major crime unit working out of Midtown North . " " Good for you , " Delaney said warmly . " How many men have you got ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a month ago I had five . Right now I have twenty-four , and they 're bringing in a lieutenant tomorrow morning . " The Chief was startled , but tried not to show it . He looked at Boone curiously . The man seemed exhausted , sallow loops below his eyes . His body had fallen in on itself , shrunken with fatigue . He looked in need of forty-eight hours of nothing but sleep and hot food . Boone was tall , thin , with a shambling walk and floppy gestures . He had gingery hair , a pale and freckled complexion . He was probably getting on to forty by now , but he still had a shy , awkward , farmerish manner , a boyish and charming smile . Delaney had worked with him on the Victor Maitland homicide and knew what a good detective he was when he was off the booze . Boone had a slow but analytical and thorough mind . He accepted the boredom and frustrations of his job without complaint . When raw courage was demanded , he could be a tiger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slight tremor of the slender fingers . It could n't be booze . Rebecca had married him only after he had vowed never to touch the stuff again . Delaney could n't believe that Boone would risk what was apparently a happy marriage . " Sergeant , " he said finally , " I 've got to tell you : you look like death warmed over . What 's wrong ? " Boone set his empty glass on the rug alongside his chair . He sat hunched over , forearms on his bony knees , his long hands clasping and unclasping . He looked up at Delaney . " We 've got a repeater , " he said . " Homicide . " The Third Deadly Sin 51The Chief stared at him , then took a slow sip of his highball . " You 're sure ? " he asked . Boone nodded . " Only two so far , " he said , " but it 's the same MO ; no doubt about it . We 've kept a lid on it so far , but it 's only a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together . " " Two similar killings ? " Delaney said doubtfully . " Could be coincidence . " The sergeant sighed , straightened up . He lit a cigarette , holding it in tobacco-stained fingers . He sat back , crossed and recrossed his gangly legs . " Maybe we 're antsy , " he acknowledged . " But ever since that Son of Sam thing , everyone in the Department 's been super-alert for repeat homicides . We should have been onto the Son of Sam killings earlier . It took Ballistics to tip us off . Now maybe we 're all too eager to put together two unconnected snuffings and yell , ' Mass killer ! ' But not in this case . These two are identical . " Chief Edward X. Delaney stared at him , but not seeing him . He felt the familiar tingle , the excitement , the challenge . More than t hat , he felt the anger and the resolve . " Want to tell me about it ? " he asked Boone . " Do I ever ! " Boone said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ missed . " " I doubt that very much , " Delaney said . " But try me . " Detective Sergeant Abner Boone recited the facts in a rapid staccato , toneless , as if reporting to a superior officer . It was obvious he had been living with this investigation for many long hours ; his recital never faltered . " First homicide : February fifteenth , this year . Victim : male Caucasian , fifty-four years old , found stabbed to death in Room 914 of the Grand Park Hotel . Naked body discovered by chambermaid at approximately 9:45 A.M. Victim had throat cut olwn and multiple stab wounds in the genitals . Cause of death according to autopsy : exsanguination . That first throat slash did n't kill him . Weapon : a sharp instrument about three inches IOng. " 52 Lawrence Sanders " Three inches ! " Delaney cried . " My God , that 's a pocket knife , a jackknife ! " " Probably , " Boone said , nodding . " Maximum width of the blade was about three-quarters of an inch , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The sergeant picked up his glass from the floor , began to chew on the ice cubes . Now that he was talking , he seemed to relax . His speech slowed , became more discursive . " So the chambermaid knocks and goes in to clean , " he continued . " She 's an old dame who does n't see too good . She 's practically alongside the bed , standing in the blood , when she sees him . She lets out a scream and faints , right into the mess . A porter comes running . After him come two hotel guests passing in the corridor . The porter calls the security man , using the room phone of course , and ruining any prints . The security man comes running with his assistant , and he calls the manager who comes running with his assistant . Finally someone has enough brains to call 911 . By the time the first blues got there , there 's like maybe ten people milling about in the room . Instant hysteria . Beautiful . I got there about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They were furious , and I do n't blame them . You could have galloped the Seventh Cavalry through that room and not done any more damage . " " These things happen , " Delaney said sympathetically . " I suppose so , " Boone said , sighing , " but we sure were n't overwhelmed with what you might call clues . The victim was a guy named George T. Puller , from Denver . A wholesale jewelry salesman . His line was handmade silver things set with turquoise and other semiprecious stones . He was in town for a jewelry show being held right there at the Grand Park . It was his second night in New York . " " Forced entry ? " " No sign , " Boone said . He explained that Room 914 was equipped with a **26;8887;TOOLONG and half dead-bolt . The door locked automatTheThird Deadly Sin 53ically when closed , but the dead-bolt could only be engaged by a turn of the key after exiting or by a thumb knob inside . " When the chambermaid came in , " Boone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead-bolt . That looks like the killer exited and just pulled the door closed . " Delaney agreed . " No signs of fiddling on the outside of the lock , " Boone went on . " And the Crime Scene Unit took that mother apart . No scratches on the tumblers , no oil , no wax . So the chances are good the lock had n't been picked ; George T. Puller invited his killer inside . " " You went through the drill , I suppose , " the Chief said . " Friends , business acquaintances ? Personal enemies ? A feud ? Business problems ? A jealous partner ? " " And hotel guests , " the sergeant said wearily . " And hotel staff . And bartenders and waiters in the cocktail lounge and dining room on the lobby floor . A lot of Well , perhaps . . . ' and Maybes . . . ' But it all added up to zip . With the jewelry show and all , the hotel was crowded that night . The last definite contact was with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That was about seven Y.M. Then the three men split . Puller told the others he was going to wander around , find a place that served a good steak , and turn in early . They never saw him again . " The CSU found a lot of prints , but mostly partials and smears . They 're still working on elimination prints . My God , Chief , in that hotel room you 've got to figure all the people who crowded in there after the body was discovered , plus the hotel staff , plus people who stayed in the room before Puller checked in. l lopeless . But we 're still working on it . " " You 've got no choice , " Delaney said stonily . " Right . One other thing : The Crime Scene Unit took the bathroom apart . They found blood in the bathtub drain . Not enough for a positive make , but the Lab Services Unit thinks it 's the victim 's blood : Same type and also , the victim was on ' 1'horazine , and it showed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 54 Lawrence Sanders " Thorazine ? What the hell was he taking that for ? " " You 're not going to believe this , but he had bad attacks of hiccups . The Thorazine helped . Anyway , it 's almost certain it was his blood in the drain , and no one else 's . There was no way he was going to get from that bed to the bathroom , take a shower , and then go back to bed to bleed to death . So it had to be the killer  --  right ? Covered with blood . Takes a shower to wash it off . Then makes an exit . " " No hairs in the drain ? Hairs that did n't belong to the victim ? " " Nothing , " Boone said mournfully . " We should be so lucky ! " " A damp towel ? " the Chief asked . Boone smiled , for the first time . " You do n't miss a thing , do you , sir ? No , there was no damp towel . But one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the killer took it along . " " Probably , " Delaney said . " A smart apple . " Sergeant Boone , intent again , serious , leaned forward . " Chief , " he said , " I think I 've given you everything I had on the Puller homicide in the first couple of days . If you had caught the squeal , how would you have handled it ? The reason I ask is that I 'm afraid I blew it . Well , maybe not blew it , but spent too much time charging off in the wrong direction . How would you have figured it ? " Edward X. Delaney was silent a moment . Then he got to his feet , went over to the liquor cabinet . He mixed himself another highball , using the last of the ice in the bucket . " Another club soda ? " he asked Boone . " Coffee ? Anything ? " " No , thanks , sir . I 'm fine . " " I 'm going to have a cigar . How about you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stick to these . " Boone shook another cigarette from his pack . The Chief held a light for him , then used the same wooden match for his cigar . From the living room and hallway , they heard the sounds of departing guests : cries and laughter , the front door slamming . Monica Delaney opened the door to the kitchen and poked her head in . The Third Deadly Sin 55 " They 're leaving , " she announced , " but it 'll take another hour to clean up . " " Need any help ? " the Chief asked . " What if I said , ' Yes ' ? " " I 'd say , ' No . ' " " Grouch , " she said , and withdrew . Delaney sat down heavily in his swivel chair . He tilted back , puffing his cigar , staring at the ceiling . " What would I have done ? " he asked . " I 'd have figured it just as you probably did . Going by percentages . A salesman in New York for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out on the town by himself . He finds that good steak he was looking for . Has a few drinks . Maybe a bottle of wine . More drinks . " Boone interrupted . " That 's what the stomach contents showed . " " He wanders around , " Delaney continued . " Visits a few rough joints . Picks up a prostitute , brings her back to his room . Maybe they had a fight about money . Maybe he wanted something kinky , and she would n't play . She 's got a knife in her purse . Most hookers carry them . He gets ugly , and she offs him . That 's the way I would have figured it . Did n't you ? " Abner Boone exhaled a great sigh of relief . " Exactly , " he said . " I figured the same scenario . A short-bladed knife  --  that 's a woman 's weapon . And the killer had to be naked when Puller was killed . Otherwise , why the shower and missing towel ? So I started the wheels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ west as Eleventh Avenue . We alerted all our whore and pimp snitches . Hit every bar in midtown Manhattan slid flashed Puller 's photograph . Zilch . Then I began to wonderwe were n't wasting our time . Because of something I haven'tId you . Something I did n't find out myself for sure until threeys after the body was found . " " What 's that ? " " Puller was n't rolled . He had an unlocked sample case in the H-trr with about twenty G 's of silver and turquoise jewelry . tithing taken . He had a wallet filled with cash and credit cards. 56 Lawrence SandersAll still there . We went back over his movements since he left Denver . His wife and partner knew how much he was carrying . We figured how much he would spend in one day and two nights in New York . It came out right . It was all there . He was n't rolled . " Edward X. Delaney stared a moment , then shook his massive head from side to side . " It does n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have taken him . For something . She did n't panic because she was smart enough to shower away his blood before she left . So why did n't she fleece him ? " The sergeant threw his hands in the air . " Beats the hell out of me , " he said bitterly . " It just does n't figure . And there 's another thing that does n't make sense : there was no sign of a struggle . Absolutely none . Nothing under Puller 's fingernails . No hairs other than his on the bed . The guy was fifty-four , sure , but he was heavy and muscular . If he had a fight with a whore , and she comes after him with a shiv , he 's going to do something  --  right ? Roll out of bed , smack her , throw a lamp  --  something . But there is no evidence he put up any resistance at all . Just lay there happily and let her slit his throat . How do you figure that ? " " Was n't unconscious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did the blood alcohol level and says he was about half-drunk , but unconsciousness would be highly improbable . " Then both men were silent , staring blankly at each other . Finally .. . " You mentioned his wife , " Delaney said . " Children ? " " Three , " Boone said . " Shit . " Boone nodded sadly . " Anyway , Chief , they gave me more men , and we 've really been hacking it . Out-of-town visitor in New York for a sales meeting gets stiffed in a midtown hotel . You can imagine the flak the Commissioner has been getting  --  from the hotel association and tourist bureau right up through a Deputy Mayor . " The Third Deadly Sin 57 " I can imagine , " Delaney said . " All right , " the sergeant said , " that was the first killing . Listen , Chief , are you sure I 'm not disturbing you ? I do n't want to bore you silly with my problems . " " No , no , you 're not boring me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and help Rebecca and Monica clean up the mess . You want to do that ? " " God forbid ! " Boone said . " I 'll just keep crying on yourshoulder . Well , the second homicide was six days ago . " " How many days between killings ? " the Chief said sharply . " Uh . . . twenty-seven , sir . Is that important ? " " Might be . Same MO ? " " Practically identical . The victim 's name was Frederick Wolheim , male Caucasian , fifty-six , stabbed to death in Room 3015 of the Hotel Pierce , that new palace on Sixth Avenue . Naked , throat slit , multiple stab wounds in the genitals . This time the victim died from that first slash . The killer got the carotid and the jugular . Blood ? You would n't believe ! A swimming pool . l'he  --  " " Wait a minute , " Delaney interrupted . " Those stab wounds in the genitals  --  vicious ? " " Very . The ME counted at least twenty in each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' Delivered with force . A few wounds in the lower groin showed bruise marks indicating the killer 's knuckles had slammed into the surrounding skin . " " I 'm aware of what bruise marks indicate , " Edward X. Delaney said . " Oh , " Boone said , abashed . " Sorry , sir . Well , this time everythingwent off all right . I mean , as far as protecting the murder s ( cue . Wolheim was supposed to deliver a speech at a morning meeting of marketing managers of electrical appliances . It was a convention being held at the Pierce . When he did n't show up on time , the guy who had organized the program came up to his toom looking for him . He got the chambermaid to open the oor . They took one look , slammed the door , and called hotelcurity . The security man took one look , slammed the door , and58 Lawrence Sanderscalled us . When my crew got there , and the Crime Scene Unit showed up , it was virgin territory , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guard outside the door . " " Good man , " Delaney said . " Ex-cop , " Boone said , grinning . " But it was n't all that much help . The Hotel Pierce is new , just opened last November , so the print problem was a little easier . But the CSU found nothing but Wolheim 's prints and the chambermaid 's . So the killer must have been very careful or smeared everything . Before he died , the victim had been drinking a brandy . His prints were on the glass and on the bottle on the dresser . There was another glass with a small shot of brandy on a table next to an armchair . Wolheim 's prints on that . No one else 's . " " The door ? " the Chief asked . " Here 's where it gets cute , " Boone said . " No keyhole showing on the outside . " He explained how the new electric locks worked . The door was opened by the insertion of a coded magnetic card into an outside slot . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even necessary to insert the card into an inside slot when exiting from the room . " A good security system , " he told Delaney . " It 's cut way down on hotel B-and-E 's . They do n't care if you do n't turn in the card when you leave because the magnetic code for the lock is changed when a guest checks out , and a new card issued . No way for a locksmith to duplicate the code . " " There must be a passcard for all the rooms , " the Chief said . " Oh sure . Held by the Security Section . The chambermaids have cards only for the rooms on the floor they service . " " Well , " Delaney said grudgingly , " it sounds good , but sooner or later some wise-ass will figure out how to beat it . But the important thing is that the killer could n't have left Wolheim 's room without putting the card in the slot on the inside of the door . Have I got that right ? " " Right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had apparently beenThe Third Deadly Sin 59used to open the door , then it was tossed on top of a bureau . It 's white plastic that would take nice prints , but it had been wiped clean . " " I told you , " the Chief said with some satisfaction . " You 're up against a smart apple . Any signs of a fight ? " " None , " Boone reported . " The ME says Wolheim must have died almost instantly . Certainly in a second or two after his throat was ripped . Chief , I saw him . It looked like his head was ready to fall off . " Delaney took a deep breath , then a swallow of his highball . He could imagine how the victim looked ; he had seen similar cases . It took awhile before you learned to look and not vomit . " Anything taken ? " he asked . " Not as far as we could tell . He had a fat wallet . Cash and travelers checks . Credit cards . All there . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pinkie ring with a diamond as big as the Ritz . Untouched . " " Son of a bitch ! " Delaney said angrily . " It does n't make sense . Anything from routine ? " " Nothing , and we 've questioned more than 200 people so far . That Hotel Pierce is a city , a city ! No one remembers seeing him with anyone . His last contact was with some convention buddies . They had dinner right there in the hotel . Then his pals wanted to go down to the traps in Greenwich Village , but Wolheim split . As far as we 've been able to discover , they were the last to see him alive . " " Was he married ? " " Yes . Five children . He was from Akron , Ohio . The cops out there broke the news . Rather them than me . " " I know what you mean . " Delaney was silent a moment , brooding . Then : " Any connection between the two men  --  Puller and Wolheim ? " " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look good . As far as we can tell , they did n't even know each other , were n't related even distantly , never even met , for God 's sake ! Went to different60 Lawrence Sandersschools . Served in different branches of the armed forces . If there 's a connection , we have n't found it . They had nothing in common . " " Sure they did . " " What 's that ? " " They were both men . And in their mid-fifties . " " Well . . . yeah , " Boone acknowledged . " But , Chief , if someone is trying to knock off every man in his mid-fifties in Manhattan , we got real trouble . " " Not every man , " the Chief said . " Out-of-towners in the city for a convention , staying at a midtown hotel . " " How does that help , sir ? " " It does n't , " Delaney said . " But it 's interesting . Did the Crime Scene Unit come up with anything ? " " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This time there were traces of the victim 's blood in the trap under the sink , so I guess the killer did n't have to take a shower . Just used the sink . " " Towel missing again ? " " That 's right . But the important thing is that they found hairs . Three of them . One on the pillow near the victim 's head . Two on the back of the armchair . Black hairs . Wolheim had reddish-gray hair . " " Well , my God , that 's something . What did the lab men say ? " " Nylon . From a wig . Too long to be from a toupee . " Delaney blew out his breath . He stared at the sergeant . " Theplot thickens , " he said . " Thickens ? " Boone cried . " It curdles ! " " It could still be a hooker . " " Could be , " the sergeant agreed . " Or a gay in drag . Or a transvestite . Anyway , the wig is a whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gays these days , and they 're cooperating  --  asking around and trying to turn up something . And of course we have some undercover guys they do n't know about . And we 're covering the black leather joints . Maybe it was aThe Third Deadly Sin 61transvestite , and the victims did n't know it until they were in bed with a man . Some of those guys are so beautiful they could fool their mother . " Edward X. Delaney pondered awhile , frowning down into his empty highball glass . " Well . . . " he said , " maybe . Was the penis cut off ? " " No . " " In all the homosexual killings I handled , the cock was hacked off . " " I talked to a sergeant in the Sex Crimes Analysis Unit , and that 's what he said . But he does n't rule out a male killer . " " I do n't either . " Then the two men were silent , each looking down , busy with his own thoughts . They heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clash of pots and pans . Comforting domestic noises . " Chief , " Sergeant Boone said finally , " what do you think we 've got here ? " Delaney looked up . " You want me to guess ? That 's all I can do  --  guess . I 'd guess it 's the start of a series of random killings . Motive unknown for the moment . The more I think about it , the more reasonable it seems that your perp is a male . I never heard of a female random killer . " " You think he 'll hit again ? " " I 'd figure on it , " Delaney advised . " If it follows the usual pattern , the periods between killings will become shorter and shorter . Not always . Look at the Yorkshire Ripper . But usually the random killer gets caught up in a frenzy , and hits faster and aster . Going by the percentages , he should kill again in about nee weeks . You better cover the midtown hotels . " " How ? " Boone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we lest all the hotels ' security sections , the word is going to get round that New York has a new Son of Sam . There goes the ) nvention business and the tourist trade . " 62 Lawrence SandersEdward X. Delaney looked at him without expression . " That 's not your worry , sergeant , " he said tonelessly . " Your job is to nab a murderer . " " Do n't you think I know that ? " Boone demanded . " But you 've got no idea of the pressure to keep this thing under wraps . " " I 've got a very good idea , " the Chief said softly . " I lived with it for thirty years . " But the sergeant would not be stopped . " Just before I came over here , " he said angrily , " I got a call from Deputy Commissioner Thorsen , and he . . . " His voice trailed away . Delaney straightened up , leaned forward . " Ivar ? " he said . " Is he in on this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he tell you to brief me on the homicides ? " " He did n't exactly tell me , Chief . He called to let me know about the lieutenant who was taking over . I told him I was beat , and I was taking off . I happened to mention I was coming over here to pick up Rebecca , and he suggested it would n't do any harm to fill you in . " Delaney smiled grimly . " If I did anything wrong , sir , I apologize . " " You did n't do anything wrong , sergeant . No apologies neces-sary . " " To tell you the truth , I need all the help on this I can get . " " So does Deputy Commissioner Thorsen , " Delaney said dryly . " Who 's the loot coming in ? " " Slavin . Marty Slavin . You know him ? " Delaney thought a moment . " A short , skinny man ? " he asked . " With a mean , pinched-up face ? Looks like a ferret ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sergeant , " the Chief said solemnly , " you have my sympathy . " The door to the living room burst open . Monica Delaney stood there , hands on her hips , challenging . " All right , you guys , " she said . " That 's enough shop talk andThe Third Deadly Sin 63Remember whens ... ' for one night . Coffee and cake in the living room . Right now . Let 's go . " They rose smiling and headed out . At the door , Sergeant Abner Boone paused . " Chief , " he said in a low voice , " any suggestions ? Anything at all that I have n't done and should do ? " Edward X. Delaney saw the fatigue and worry in the man 's face . With Lieutenant Martin Slavin coming in to take over command , Boone had cause for worry . " Decoys , " the Chief said . " If they wo n't let you alert the hotels , then put out decoys . Say between the hours of seven Y.M. and midnight . Dress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t heir early fifties . Loud , beefy , flashing money . Have them cruise bars and hotel cocktail lounges . Probably a waste of time , but you never can tell . " " I 'll do it , " the sergeant said promptly . " I 'll request the manpower tomorrow . " " Call Thorsen , " Delaney advised . " He 'll get you what you need . And sergeant , if I were you , I 'd get the decoy thing rolling before Stavin shows up . Make sure everyone knows it was your idea . " " Yes . I 'll do that . Uh , Chief , if this guy hits again like you figure , and I get the squeal , would you be willing to come over to the scene ? You know just to look around . I keep thinking there might be something we 're missing . " Delaney smiled at him . " Sure . Give me a call , and I 'll be there . It 'll be like old times . " " Thank you , Chief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ' cat help . " " I have ? " Delaney said , secretly amused , and they went in for coffee and cake . Chief Edward X. Delaney inspected the living room critically . t had been tidied in satisfactory fashion . Ashtrays had been leaned , footstools were where they belonged . His favorite club hair was in its original position . Ile turned to see his wife regarding him mockingly. 64 Lawrence Sanders " Does it pass inspection , 0 lord and master ? " she inquired . " Nice job , " he said , nodding . " You can come to work for me anytime . " " I do n't do windows , " she said . The oak cocktail table had been set with coffeepot , creamer , sugar , cups , saucers , dessert plates , cutlery . And half a pineapple cheesecake . " Ab , " Rebecca Boone said , " the coffee is decaf , so you wo n't have any trouble sleeping tonight . " He grunted . " And the cheesecake is low-cal , " Monica said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said cheerfully . " I 'm going to have a thin slice anyway . They helped themselves , then settled back with their coffeeand cake . Delaney was ensconced in his club chair , SergeantBoone in a smaller armchair . The two women sat on the sofa . " Good cake , " the Chief said approvingly . " Rich , but light . Where did you get it ? " " Clara Webster made it , " Monica said . " She insisted on leaving what was left . " " How did the meeting go ? " Boone asked . " Very well , " Monica said firmly . " Interesting and  --  and instructive . Did n't you think so , Rebecca ? " " Absolutely , " Mrs. Boone said loyally . " I really enjoyed the discussion after the lecture . " " What was the lecture about ? " Boone said . Monica Delaney raised her chin , glanced defiantly at her husband . " The Preorgasmic Woman , " Monica said . " Good God ! " the Chief said , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 'd say that , " Rebecca explained . " Oh she did , did she ? " Delaney said . " Well , I think it 's a natural , normal reaction . What , exactly , is a Preorgasniie Woman ? " The Third Deadly Sin 65 " It 's obvious , is n't it ? " Monica said . " It 's a woman who has never had an orgasm . " " A frigid woman ? " Boone said . " Typical male reaction , " his wife scoffed . " Frigid ' is a pejorative word , " Mrs. Delaney said . " A loaded word . Actually , frigid ' means being averse to sex , applying to both men and women . But the poor men , with their fragile little egos , could n't stand the thought of there being a sexless male , so they 've used the word frigid ' to describe only women . But our speaker tonight said there is no such irreversible condition in men or women . They 're just preorgasmic . Through therapy t raining , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their rightful place in society , " Chief Delaney added with heavy irony . Monica refused to rise to the bait . She was aware that he was proud of her activities in the feminist movement . They might have discussions that sometimes degenerated into bitter argu- ments . But Monica knew that his willingness to debate was better than his saying , " Yes , dear . . . Yes , dear . . . Yes , dear , " with his nose stuck in the obituary page of The New York Times . And he was proud of her . Following the death of their infant son , she had gone into such a guilt-ridden depression that he had despaired of her sanity and tried to steel himself to the task of urging her to seek professional help . But she was a strong woman and had pulled herself up . The presence of her two young girls helped , of course ; their needs , problems , and demands could not be met if she continued to sit In a darkened room , weeping . And after they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) r her physical energy and mental inquisitiveness in the feminist u vement . She embarked on a whirlwind of meetings , lectures , ymposiums , picketings , petition-signing , letter-writing , and righborhood betterment . Edward X. Delaney was delighted . It gave him joy to see her ive , flaming , eager to advance a cause in which she believed . If sr brought her " job " home with her , it was no more than he had one when he was on active duty. 66 Lawrence SandersHe had discussed all his cases with Monica and with Barbara , his first wife . Both had listened patiently , understood , and frequently offered valuable advice . But admiring Monica 's ardor for the feminist cause did n't mean he had to agree with all the tenets she espoused . Some he did ; some he did not . And he 'd be damned if he 'd be reticent about expressing his opinion . Now , sitting across from his wife as she chatted with the Boones , he acknowledged , not for the first time , how lucky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Monica Delaney was a heavy-bodied woman , with a good waist between wide shoulders and broad hips . Her bosom was full , her legs tapered to slender ankles . There was a soft sensuality about her , a physical warmth . Her ardor was not totally mental . Thick black hair , with a sheen , was combed back from a wide , unlined brow and fell almost to her shoulders . She made no effort to pluck her solid eyebrows , and her makeup was minimal . She was a big , definite woman , capable of tenderness and tears . Watching his wife 's animation as she talked to the Boones , Edward X. Delaney felt familiar stirrings and wished his guests gone . Monica turned her head suddenly to look at him . As usual , she caught his mood . She winked . " Tell me , Chief , " Rebecca said in her ingenuous way , " what do you really think of the women 's movement ? " He kept his eyes resolutely averted from Monica , and addressedhis remarks directly to Rebecca . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Well , I have no quarrel with most of the aims . " " I know , " she said , sighing resignedly . " Equal pay for equal work . " " No , no , " he said quickly . " Monica has taught me better than that . Equal pay for comparable work . " His wife nodded approvingly . " And what do you object to ? " Rebecca asked pertly . He marshaled his thoughts . " Not objections , " he said slowly . " Two reservations . The first is no fault of the feminist movement . It 's a characteristic of allThe Third Deadly Sin 67minority or subjugated groups that desire to be treated as individuals , not stereotypes . No argument there . But to achieve that aim , they must organize . Then , to obtain political and economic power , they must project as  --  as monolithic a front as they can . The blacks , Chicanos , Indians , Italian-Americans , women  --  whatever . To wield maximum power , they must form a group , association @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice . Again , no argument . " But by doing that , they become  --  or at least this is their public image  --  less individuals and more stereotypes . They become capitalized Women , Blacks , and so forth . There is a contradiction there , a basic conflict . Frankly , I do n't know how it can be resolved  --  if it can . If the answer is fragmentation , allowing the widest possible expressions of opinion within the bloc , then they sacrifice most of the social , political , and economic power which was the reason for their organizing in the first place . " " Do you think I 'm a feminist stereotype ? " Monica said hotly . " No , I do not , " he replied calmly . " But only because I know you , am married to you , live with you . But can you deny that ittce the current women 's movement started  --  when was it , about ( teen years ago ?  --  a stereotype of the feminist has been evoly-gMonica Delaney slammed her palm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Empty coffee cups rattled on their saucers . " You 're infuriating ! " she said . " That 's true , " he said equably . " What 's the second thing ? " Rebecca Boone said hastily , think-g to avert a family squabble . " You said you had two objections the feminist movement . What 's the second ? " Not objections , " he reminded her . " Reservations . The second this " Women in the feminist movement are working to achieve uality of opportunity , equal pay , and the same chances for vancement offered to men in business , government , industry , cl so forth . Fine . But have you really thought through what you II ' equality ' might entail ? " Look at poor Sergeant Boone there  --  dead to the world . " The68 Lawrence Sanderssergeant grinned feebly .

But he 's a professional cop , and he does the best he can . Would you like a comparable job with all its demands and stress and strain and risk ? I do n't believe it . " What I 'm trying to say is that I do n't believe that feminists fully realize what they 're asking for . You do n't knock down a wall until you know what 's behind it . There are dangers , drawbacks , and responsibilities you 're not aware of . " " We 're willing to accept those responsibilities , " Rebecca Boone said stoutly . " Are you ? " the Chief said with gentle sarcasm . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dark alley after some coked-up addict armed with a machete ? Are you willing to serve in the armed forces in combat and go forward when you know your chances of survival are practically nil ? " On a more prosaic level , are you willing to work the hours that a fast-track business executive does ? Willing to meet the demands of bosses and workers , make certain your schedules are met , stay within budget , turn a profit  --  and risk peptic ulcers , lung cancel. , alcoholism , and keeling over from a coronary or cerebral hemorrhageat the age of forty ? " Look , I 'm not saying all men 's jobs are like that . A lot of men can handle the pressures of a top-level position and go home every night and water the petunias .

" Let us be the judge of what makes us happy , " she snapped . " That 's what the movement is all about .

It 's not all true , but there 's truth in it . " " So ? " he said . " So , " she said , " we recognize that when - omen achieve their rightful position in the upper levels of the establishment , they will be subject to the same strains , stresses , and pressures that men endure .

" 70 Lawrence SandersChief Delaney went for hats and coats . The women kissed . The men shook hands . Farewells were exchanged , promises to get together again as soon as possible . The Delaneys stood inside their open front door , watched as the Boones got into their car and drove off , waving . Then the Chief closed the front door , double-locked and chained it . He turned to face his wife . " Alone at last , " he said . She looked at him . " You covered yourself with glory tonight , buster , " she said . " Thank you , " he said . She glared , then burst out laughing . She took him into her strong arms . They were close , close . She drew back . " What would I do without you ? " she said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He made the rounds . He did it every night : barring the castle , flooding the moat , hauling up the drawbridge . He started in the attic and worked his way down to the basement . He checked every lock on every door , every latch on every window . This nightly duty did n't seem silly to him ; he had been a New York cop . When he had finished this chore , he turned off the lights downstairs , leaving on the outside stoop light and a dim lamp in the hallway . Then he climbed the stairs to the second-floor bedroom . Monica was turning down the beds . He sat down heavily in a fragile , cretonne-covered boudoir chair . He bent over , began to unlace his thick-soled , ankle-high shoes of black kangaroo leather , polished to a high gloss . He did n't know of a single old cop who did n't have trouble with his feet . " Was it really a good meeting ? " he asked his wife . " So-so , " she said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stuff . The lecture , I mean . But everyone seemed interested . And they ate . My God , did they eat ! What did you have ? " " A sandwich and a beer . " " Two sandwiches and two beers . I counted . Edward , you 've gotThe Third Deadly Sin 71to stop gorging on sandwiches . You 're getting as big as a house . " " More of me to love , " he said , rising to his bare feet , beginning to strip off his jacket and vest . " What does that mean ? " she demanded . " That when you weigh 300 pounds I wo n't be able to contain my passion ? " They both undressed slowly , moving back and forth , to the closet , their dressers , the bathroom . They exchanged disconnectedremarks , yawning . " Poor Abner , " he said . " Did you get a close look at him ? He 's out on his feet .

" " Make us one . Strawberry , please . " He sat on the edge of his bed in his underdrawers . Around his thick neck was a faded ring of blue : a remembrance of the days when New York cops wore the old choker collars . He watched his wife become naked . " You 've lost a few pounds , " he said . " Does it show ? " she said , pleased . " It does indeed . Your waist ... " She regarded herself in the full-length mirror on the closet door . " Well ... " she said doubtfully , " maybe a pound or two . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Sure . " " No more sandwiches for you . " Fie sighed . " You never give up , do you ? " he said wonderingly . " You 'll ever admit defeat . Never admit that you 're married to the most stubborn man in the world . " 72 Lawrence Sanders " I 'll keep nudging you , " she vowed . " Lots of luck , " he said . " Have you heard from Karen Thorsen lately ? " " As a matter of fact , she called yesterday . Did n't I tell you ? " " No . " " Well , she did . Wants to get together with us . I told her I 'd talk to you and set a time . " " Uh-huh . " Something in his tone alerted her . She finished pulling the blue cotton nightgown over her head . She smoothed it down , then looked at him . " What 's it about ? " she said . " Does Ivar want to see you ? " " I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do is pick up the phone . " She guessed . She was so shrewd . " What did you and Abner talk about  --  a case ? " " Yes , " he said . " Can you tell me about it ? " " Sure , " he said . " Wait 'll I cream my face , " she said . " Do n't fall asleep first . " " I wo n't , " he promised . While she was in the bathroom , he got into his flannel pajama pants with a drawstring top . He sat on the edge of his bed , longing for a cigar but lighting one of Monica 's low-tar cigarettes . It did n't taste like anything . He was a rude , blocky man who lumbered when he walked . His iron-gray hair was cut en brosse . His deeply lined , melancholy features had the broody look of a man who hoped for the best and expected the worst . He had the solid , rounded shoulders of a machine-gunner , a torso that still showed old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the weathered face , the body bearing scars of old wounds  --  all gave the impression of a beast no longer with the swiftness of youth , but with the cunning of years , and vigor enough to kill . He sat there solidly , smoking his toy cigarette . He watched hisThe Third Deadly Sin 73wife get into bed , prop her back against the headboard . She pulled sheet and blanket up to her waist . " All right , " she said . " Tell . " But first he went to his bedside table . It held , among other things , his guns , cuffs , a sap , and other odds and ends he had brought home when he had cleaned out his desk at the old headquarters building on Centre Street . It also contained a bottle of brandy and two cut-glass snifters . He poured Monica and himself healthy shots . " Splendid idea , " she said . " Better than pills , " he said . " We 'll sleep like babies . " He sat on the edge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . They raised their glasses to each other , took small sips . " Plasma , " he said . He then recounted to her what Sergeant Boone had told him of the two hotel murders . He tried to keep his report as brief and succinct as possible . When he described the victims ' wounds , Monica 's face whitened , but she did n't ask him to stop . She just took a hefty belt of her brandy . " So , " he concluded , " that 's what Boone 's got  --  which is n't a whole hell of a lot . Now you know why he was so down tonight , and so exhausted . He 's been going all out on this for the past month . " " Why have n't I read anything about it in the papers ? " Monica asked . " They 're trying to keep a lid on it  --  which is stupid , but understandable . They do n't want a rerun of the Son of Sam I ) vsteria . Also , tourism is big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all I know . You can imagine what headlines like 11 ) TEL KILLER ON LOOSE IN MANHATTAN would do to the convention trade . " " Maybe Abner will catch the killer . " " Maybe , " he said doubtfully . " With a lucky break . But I do n't think he 'll do it on the basis of what he 's got now . It 's just too thin . Also , he 's got another problem : they 're bringing in Lieuten-74 Lawrence Sandersant Martin Slavin to take command of the investigation . Slavin is a little prick . An ambitious conniver who always covers his ass by going strictly by the book . Boone will have his hands full with him . " " Why are they bringing in someone over Boone ? Has n't Abner been doing a good job ? " " I know the sergeant 's work , " the Chief said , taking a sip of brandy . " He 's a good , thorough detective . I believe that he 's done all that could be done . But they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about twenty-five men working on this thing now , so I guess they feel they need higher rank in command . But I do assure you , Slavin 's not going to break this thing . Unless there 's another homicide and the killer slips up . " " You think there will be another one , Edward ? " He sighed , looked down at his brandy glass . Then he stood , began to pace back and forth past the foot of her bed . She followed him with her eyes . " I practically guarantee it , " he said . " It has all the earmarks of a psycopathic repeater . The worst , absolutely the worst kind of homicides to solve . Random killings . Apparently without motive . No connection except chance between victim and killer . " " They do n't know each other ? " " Right . The coming together is accidental . Up to that time they 've been strangers . " Then he explained things to her that he did n't have to explain to Sergeant Boone . " Monica @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , many years ago , about seventy-five percent of all homicides in New York were committed by relatives , friends , acquaintances , or associates of the victims . " The other homicides , called stranger murders , ' were committedby killers who did n't know their victims . They might have been felony homicides , committted during a burglary or robbery , or snipings , or  --  worst of all just random killing for the pleasure of killing . There 's a German word for it that I do n't remember , but it means death lust , murder for enjoyment . " Anyway , in those days , when three-quarters of all homicidesThe Third Deadly Sin 75were committed by killers who knew their victims , we had a high solution rate . We zeroed in first on the husband , wife , lover , whoever would inherit , a partner who wanted the whole pie , and so forth . " But in the last ten years , the percentage of stranger murders has been increasing and the solution rate has been declining . I 've never seen a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curves are almost identical , percentage-wise ; as stranger murders increase , the solution rate decreases . " Because stranger murders are bitches to break . You 've got nothing to go on , nowhere to start . " " You did , " she said somberly . " You found Bernard 's killer . " " I did n't say it could n't be done . I just said it 's very difficult . Alot tougher than a crime of passion or a murder that follows afamily fight . " " So you think there 's a chance they 'll catch him  --  the hotel killer ? " He stopped suddenly , turned to face her . " Him ? " he said . " After what I told you , you think the murderer is a man ? " She nodded . " Why ? " he asked her curiously . " I do n't know , " she said . " I just ca n't conceive of a woman doing things like that . " " A short-bladed knife is a woman 's weapon , " he told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an attack . And the killer seems to have been naked at the time of the assault . " " But why ? " she cried . " Why would a woman do a thing like t hat ? " " Monica , crazies have a logic all their own . It 's not our logic . What they do seems perfectly reasonable and justifiable to them . To us , it 's monstrous and obscene . But to them , it makes sense . Their sense . " He came over to sit on the edge of her bed again . They sipped their brandies . He took up her free hand , clasped it in his big paw . " I happen to agree with you , " he said . " At this point , knowing76 Lawrence Sandersonly what Sergeant Boone told me , I do n't think it 's a woman either . But you 're going by your instinct and prejudices ; I 'm going by percentages . There have been many cases of random killings : Son of Sam , Speck , Heirens , Jack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Black Dahlia , the Hillside Strangler  --  all male killers . There have been multiple murders by women  --  Martha Beck in the Lonely Hearts Case , for instance . But the motive for women is almost always greed . What I 'm talking about are random killings with no apparent motive . Only by men , as far as I know . " " Could it be a man wearing a long black wig ? Dressed like a woman ? " " Could be , " he said . " There 's so much in this case that has no connection with anything in my experience . It 's like someone came down from outer space and offed those salesmen . " " The poor wives , " she said sadly . " And children . " " Yes , " he said . He finished his brandy . " The whole thing is a puzzle . A can of worms . I know how Boone feels . So many contradictions . So many loose ends . Finish your drink . " Obediently , she drained the last of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took the two glasses into the bathroom , rinsed them , set them in the sink to drain . He turned off the bathroom light . He came back to Monica 's bedside to swoop and kiss her cheek . " Sleep well , dear , " he said . " After that ? " she said . " Thanks a lot . " " You wanted to hear , " he reminded her . " Besides , the brandy will help . " He got into his own bed , turned off the bedside lamp . " Get a good night 's sleep , " Monica muttered drowsily . " I love you . " " I love you , " he said , and pulled sheet and blanket up to his chin . He went through all the permutations and combinations in his mind : man , woman , prostitute , homosexual , transvestite . Even , 1w considered wildly , a transsexual . That would be something new . The Third Deadly Sin 77He lay awake , wide-eyed , listening . He knew the moment Monica was asleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , became deeper , each exhalation accompanied by a slight whistle . It did n't annoy him any more than his own grunts and groans disturbed her . He was awake a long time , going over Boone 's account again and again . Not once did he pause to wonder why the investigationinterested him , why it obsessed him . He was retired ; it was really none of his business . If his concern had been questioned , he would have replied stolidly : " Well . . . two human beings have been killed . That 's not right . " He turned to peer at the bedside clock . Almost 2:30 A.M. But he could n't let it go till tomorrow ; he had to do it now . He slid cautiously out of bed , figuring to get his robe and slippers from the closet . He was halfway across the darkened room when : " What 's wrong ? " came Monica 's startled voice . " I 'm sorry I woke you up , " he said . " Well , I am up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going ? " " Uh , I thought I 'd go downstairs . There 's a call I want to make . " " Abner Boone , " she said instantly . " You never give up , do you ? " He said nothing . " Well , you might as well call from here , " she said . " But you 'll wake him up , too . " " No , I wo n't , " Delaney said with certainty . " He wo n't be sleeping . " He sat on the edge of his bed , switched on the lamp . They both blinked in the sudden light . He picked up the phone . " What 's their number ? " he asked . She gave it to him . He dialed . " Yes ? " Boone said , picking up after the first ring . His voice was clogged , throaty . " Edward X. Delaney here . I hope I did n't wake you , sergeant . " 78 Lawrence Sanders " No , Chief . I thought I 'd pass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My brain is churning . " " Rebecca ? " " No , sir . She 'd sleep through an earthquake . " " Sergeant , did you check into the backgrounds of the victims ? The personal stuff ? " " Yes , sir . Sent a man out to Denver and Akron . If you 're wondering about their homosexual records , it 's nit . For both of them . No sheets , no hints , no gossip . Apparently both men were straight . " " Yes , " Delaney said , " I should have known you 'd look into that . One more thing ... " Boone waited . " You said that after the second homicide , the Crime Scene Unit found two black hairs on the back of an armchair ? " " That 's correct , sir . And one on the pillow . All three were black nylon . " " It 's the two they found on the armchair that interest me . Did they take photographs ? " " Oh , hell yes . Hundreds of them . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Did they photograph those two hairs on the armchair before they picked them up ? " " I 'm sure they did , Chief . With a ruler alongside to show size and position . " " Good , " Delaney said . " Now what you do is this : Get that photograph of the exact position of the two hairs on the armchair . Take a man with you from the Lab Services Unit or the Medical Examiner 's office . Go back to the murder scene and find that armchair . Measure carefully from the point where the hairs were found to the seat of the chair . Got that ? Assuming the hairs came from the killer , you 'll get a measurement from the back of his head to the base of his spine . From that , the technicians should be able to give you the approximate height of the killer . I t wo n't be exact , of course ; it 'll be a rough approximation . But it 'll be something . " The Third Deadly Sin 79There was silence a moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Why did n't I think of that ? " " You ca n't think of everything , " Delaney said . " I 'm supposed to , " Boone said bitterly . " That 's what they 're paying me for . Thank you , sir . " " Good luck , sergeant . " When he hung up , he saw Monica looking at him with wonderment . " You 're something , you are , " she said . " I just wanted to help him out . " " Oh sure . " " I really am sorry I woke you up , " he said . " Well , " she said , " so it should n't be a total loss ... " She reached for him . Zoe Kohler had read the autobiography of a playwright who had suffered from mental illness . He had been confined for several years . He said it was not true that the insane thought themselves sane . He said that frequently the mad knew themselves to be mad . Either they were unable to fight their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he wrote , there were pleasures and beauties in madness . The phrase " pleasures and beauties " stuck in her mind ; she thought of it often . The pleasures of madness . The beauties of madness . On the afternoon after her second adventure ( that was what Zoe Kohler called them : " adventures " ) , Everett Pinckney came into her office at the Hotel Granger . He parked his lank form on the edge of her desk . He leaned toward her ; she smelled the whiskey . " There 's been another one , " he said in a low voice . She looked at him , then shook her head . " I do n't understand , Mr. Pinckney . " " Another murder . A stabbing . This one at the Pierce . Just like that one at the Grand Park last month . You read about that ? " 8()The Third Deadly Sin 81She nodded . " This one was practically identical , " he said . " Same killer . " " How awful , " she said , her face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Sam , " he said with some relish . She sighed . " I suppose the newspapers will have a field day . " " They 're trying to keep the connection out of the papers . Forthe time being . Not good news for the hotel business . But it 's gotto come out , sooner or later . " " I suppose so , " she said . " They 'll catch him , " he said , getting off her desk . " It 's just a question of time . How are you feeling today ? " " Much better , thank you . " " Glad to hear it . " She watched him shamble from her office . " Him , " he had said . " They 'll catch him . " They thought it was a man ; that was comforting . But what Pinckney had said about the newspapers  --  that was exciting . She looked up the telephone number of The New York Times . It was an easy number to remember . She stopped at the first working phone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She tried to speak in a deep , masculine voice , and told the Times operator that she wanted to talk to someone about the murder at the Hotel Pierce . There was a clicking as her call was transferred . She waited patiently . " City desk , " a man said . " Gardner . " " This is about that murder last night at the Hotel Pierce , " she %a id , trying to growl it out . " Yes ? " " It 's exactly like the one last month at the Grand Park Hotel . Ike same person did both of them . " There was silence for a second or two . Then : " Could you give me your name and  --  " She hung up , smiling . She recalled , as precisely as she could , her actions of the previous night after she had waved goodbye to Ernest Mittle82 Lawrence Sandersoutside her apartment house door . She concentrated on the areas of risk . When she had exited again , the doorman had hardly given her a glance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoes . The cabdriver would never remember the woman he had driven to 72nd Street and Central Park West . And even if he did , what had that to do with a midnight murder at the Hotel Pierce ? No one in the ladies ' room of the Filmore had seen her don wig and apply makeup . She had left from the hotel exit ; the bartender could not have noted the transformation . The driver of the taxi that had taken her to a corner three blocks from the Pierce had hardly looked at her . They had exchanged no conversation . The cocktail lounge , El Khatar , had been thronged , and there had been women more flamboyantly dressed than she . There had been another couple in the crowded elevator who had gotten off on the 30th floor . But they had turned away in the opposite direction , talking and laughing . Zoe Kohler did n't think she and Fred had been noticed . Within the room , she had been careful about what she touched . After he was gone ( she did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just gone ) , she was surprised to see that she was bloodsplatteredonly from the elbows down . She had stared at the blood a long time . Her hands and forearms dripping the bright , viscid fluid . She sniffed it . It had an odor . Not hers , but it did smell . Then she had gone into the bathroom to wash the crimson stains away . Rinsing and rinsing with water as hot as she could endure . And then letting the hot water run steadily to cleanse the sink and drain while she dried her arms and hands . She went back to the bedroom to dress , not glancing at what lay on the bed . Then , returning to the bathroom , she had turned off the water and used the damp towel to wipe the faucet handles , the inside doorknob and later , the white plastic card Fred had tossed atop the bureau near the outside door . The Third Deadly Sin 83Before she left , she had removed her wig and makeup , scrubbing her face with the towel . Wig @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a final look around and decided there was nothing she should have done that she had not . The descending elevator was crowded and no one had looked at her : a pale-faced , mousy-haired woman wearing a loose-fitting trenchcoat buttoned up to the chin . Of course no one looked at her ; she was Zoe Kohler again , the invisible woman . She had walked over to Fifth Avenue and taken a cab downtown to 38th Street and Fifth . She walked from that corner to her apartment house . She felt no fear alone on the street . Her life could have ended at that moment and it would have been worthwhile . That was how she felt . Locked and chained inside her own apartment , she had showered ( the third time that day ) . She replaced all her secret things in their secret places . She pushed the damp towel deep into the plastic bag in her garbage can , to be thrown into the incinerator in the morning . She had n't been aware of her menstrual cramps for hours and hours . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gripping with increasing intensity . She inserted a tampon and swallowed a Midol , two Anacin , a vitamin B-complex capsule , a vitamin C tablet , and ate half a container of blueberry yogurt . Just before she got into bed , she shook a Pulvule 304 from her jar of prescription Tuinal and gulped it down . She slept like a baby . During the month that followed , Zoe Kohler had the sense of her ordered life whirling apart . She was conscious of an acceleratedpassage of time . Days flashed , and even weeks seemed condensed , so that Fridays succeeded Mondays , and it was an rl fort to recall what had happened between . Increasingly , the past intruded on the present . She found erself thinking more and more of her marriage , her husband , ' other , father , her girlhood . She spent one evening trying to84 Lawrence Sandersremember the names of friends who had attended her 13th birthday party , and writing them down . The party had been a disaster . Partly because several invited guests had not shown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because her periods had started on that day . She had begun to bleed , and was terrified . She thought it would never stop , and saw herself as an emptied sack of wrinkled white skin . Ernest Mittle phoned her at home a week after their meeting . She had n't expected him to call , as he had promised  --  men never did  --  and it took her a moment to bring him to mind . " I hope I 'm not disturbing you , " he said . " Oh no , " she said . " No . " " How are you , Zoe ? " " Very well , thank you . And you ? " " Just fine , " he said in his light , boyish voice . " I was hoping that if you did n't have any plans for tomorrow night , we might have dinner and see a movie , or something . " " I 'm sorry , " she said quickly . " I do have plans . " He said he was disappointed and would try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then hung up . She stared at the dead , black phone . " Do n't be too eager , Zoe , " her mother had instructed firmly . " Do n't let men get the idea that you 're anxious or easy . " She did n't know if it was her mother 's teaching or her own lack of inclination , but she was n't certain she wanted to see Ernest Mittle again . If she did , it would just be something to do . He did call again , and this time she accepted his invitation . It was for Saturday night , which she took as a good omen . New York men dated second or third choices during the week . Saturday night was for favorites : an occasion . Ernest Mittle insisted on meeting her in the lobby of her apartment house . From there , they took a cab to a French restaurant on East 60th Street where he had made a reservation . The dining room was warm , cheerfully decorated , crowded . Relaxing there , smoking a cigarette , sipping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diners , Zoe Kohler felt for a moment that she was visible and belonged in the world . The Third Deadly Sin 85After dinner , they walked over to 60th Street and Third Avenue . But there was a long line before the theater showing the movie he wanted to see . He looked at her , dismayed . " I do n't want to wait , " he said . " Do you ? " " Not really , " she said . And then , without considering it , she added : " Why do n't we go back to my apartment and watch TV , or just talk ? " Something happened to his face : a quick twist . But then he was the eager spaniel again , anxious to please , his smile hopeful . He seemed constantly prepared to apologize . " That sounds just fine , " he said . " I 'm afraid I have nothing to drink , " she said . " We 'll stop and pick up a couple of bottles of white wine , " he said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she assured him . They had exhausted remembrances of their youth in Minnesotaand Wisconsin . They had no more recollections to exchange . Now , tentatively , almost fearfully , their conversation became more personal . They explored a new relationship , feinting , pulling back , trying each other , ready to escape . Both stiff with shyness and embarrassment . In her apartment , she served the white wine with ice cubes . He sat in an armchair , his short legs thrust out . He was wearing a vested tweed suit , a tattersall shirt with a knitted tie . He seemed laden and bowed with the weight of his clothing , made smaller and frail . He had tiny feet . She sat curled into a corner of the living room couch , her shoes off , legs pulled up under her gray flannel jumper . She felt remarkably at ease . No tension . He did not frighten her . If she had said , " Go , " he would have gone , she was certain . " Why have n't you married ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gay . " Who 'd have me ? " he said , showing his small white teeth . " Besides , Zoe , there is n't the pressure to marry anymore . There at i. all kinds of different lifestyles . More and more single-person households every year . " " I suppose , " she said vaguely. 86 Lawrence Sanders " Are you into the women 's movement ? " " Not really , " she said . " I do n't know much about it . " " I do n't either , " he said . " But what I 've read seems logical and reasonable . " " Some of those women are so  --  so loud and crude , " she burst out . " Oh my , yes , " he said hurriedly . " That 's true . " " They just just push so , " she went on . " They call themselves feminists , but I do n't think they 're very feminine . " " You 're so right , " he said . " I think that , first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ? I mean , refined and gentle . Low-voiced and modest in her appearance . That 's what I was always taught . Clean and wellgroomed . Generous and sympathetic . " " I was brought up to respect women , " he said . " That 's what my mother told me  --  that men will always respect you if you act like a lady . " " Is your mother still alive ? " he asked . " Oh yes . " " She sounds like a wonderful woman . " " She is , " Zoe said fervently , " she really is . She 's over sixty now , but she 's very active in her bridge club and her garden club and her book club . She reads all the best-sellers . And she 's in charge of the rummage sales at the church . She certainly does keep busy . " What I mean is that she does n't just sit at home and do housecleaning and cook . She has a life of her own . That does n't mean she does n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he 's not her entire life . She 's a very independent woman . " " That 's marvelous , " Ernest said , " that she finds so much of interest to do . " " You should see her , " Zoe said . " She looks much younger than her age . She has her hair done every week , a blue rinse , and she dresses just so . She 's got wonderful taste in clothes . She 's immaculate . Not a hair out of place . She 's a little overweight now , but she stands just as straight as ever . " " Sounds like a real lady , " he said . The Third Deadly Sin 87 " Oh , she is . A real lady . " Then Ernest Mittle began to talk about his mother , who seemed to be a woman much like Zoe had described . After a while she heard his voice as a kind of drone . She was conscious of what he was saying . She kept her eyes fixed on his face with polite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the past intruding . She had lived in New York for about a year . Then , shriveled with loneliness , had ventured out to a highly publicized bar on Second Avenue that advertised : " For discriminating , sophisticatedsingles who want to get it on and get it off ! " It was called The Meet Market . She had given a great deal of thought to how she would dress and how she would comport herself . She would be attractive , but not in a brazen , obvious way . She would be alert , sparkling , and would listen closely to what men said , and speak little . Friendly but not forward . She would not express an opinion unless asked . She had worn a black turtleneck sweater cinched with a wide , rushed leather belt . Her long wool skirt fitted snugly but not immodestly . Her pantyhose were sheer , and she wore pumps with heels that added an inch to her 5 ' 6 " height . She tried a light dusting of powder , a faint blush of rouge and lipstick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first experiment with false eyelashes was not a success ; she got them on crooked , giving her a depraved , Oriental look . Finally , she at ripped them away and darkened her own wispy lashes . The Meet Market had been a shock . It was smaller than she had envisaged , and so crowded that patrons were standing outside on the sidewalk . They were drinking beers and shouting tit each other to be heard above the din of the jukebox just inside the door . She edged herself nervously inside and was dismayed to seethat most of the women there , the singles and those with escorts , ere younger than she . Most were in their late teens and early rt-ties , and were dressed in a variety of outlandish costumes , ightly colored , that made her look like a frump. 88 Lawrence SandersIt took her fifteen minutes to work her way to the bar , and another five minutes to order a glass of beer from one of the busy , insolent bartenders . She was bumped continually , shouldered , jostled back and forth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a fixed smile , not looking about . Life surged around her : shouts of laughter , screamed conversation , blare of jukebox , obscene jesting . The women as lewd as the men . Still she stood , smiling determinedly , and ordered another glass of beer . " Sorry , doll , " a man said , knocking her shoulder as he reached across to take drinks from the bartender . She turned to look . A husky young man , dark , with a helmet of greasy ringlets , a profile from a Roman coin . He wore an embroidered shirt unbuttoned to the waist . About his muscled neck were three gold chains . Ornate medallions swung against the thick mat of hair on his chest . He had a musky scent of something so cloying that she almost gagged . His teeth were chipped , and he needed a shave . There were wet stains on the shirt beneath his armpits . He does n't care , she had thought suddenly . He just does n't care . She admired him for not caring . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and watched the strange world swirl about her . She felt that she had strayed into a circus . Everyone was a performer except her . She had seen that most of the women were not only younger than she , but prettier . With ripe , bursting bodies they flaunted without modesty . Zoe saw blouses zipped down to reveal cleavage . Tanktops so tight that hard nipples poked out . Sheer shirts that revealed naked torsos . Jeans so snug that buttocks were clearly delineated , some bearing suggestive patches : SMART ASS . BOTTOMS UP . srx POT . She had arrived at The Meet Market shortly after 11:30 P.M. The noise and crush were at their worst an hour later . Then , The Third Deadly Sin 89slowly , the place began to empty out . Contacts were made ; couples disappeared . Still Zoe Kohler stood at the bar , drinking her flat beer , her face aching with her smile . " Wassamatta , doll ? " the dark young man said , at her elbow again . " Get stood up ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his mouth wide . She saw his bad teeth , a coated tongue , a red tunnel . He took another drink from the bartender , gulped down half of it without stopping . A rivulet of beer ran down his chin . He wiped it away with the back of his hand . He looked around at the emptying room . " I missed the boat , " he said to Zoe . " Always looking for something better . Know what I mean ? Then I end up with Mother Five-fingers . " He laughed again , in her face . His breath smelled sour : beer , and something else . He clapped her on the shoulder . " Where you from , doll ? " he said . " Manhattan , " she said . " Well , that 's something , " he said . " Last night I connected with a real doll , and she 's from Queens and wants to go to her place . My Dick  --  right ? No way am I going to Queens . North of Thirtyfourthand south of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the corner . " " So ? " she said archly . " So let 's go , " he said . " Beggars ca n't be choosers . " She had never decided if he meant her or himself . He lived in a dreadful one-room apartment in a tenement on Kith Street , off Second Avenue . The moment they were inside , lic said , " Got ta piss , " and dashed for the bathroom . He left the door open . She heard the sound of his stream splashing into the bowl . She put her palms over her ears and Wondered dully why she did not run . Ile came out , stripping off his shirt , and then stepping out of is jeans . He was wearing a stained bikini no larger than a  --  kstrap . She could not take her eyes from the bulge. 90 Lawrence Sanders " I got half a joint , " he said , then saw where she was looking . He laughed . " Not here , " he said , pointing . " I mean good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thank you , " she said primly . " But you go right ahead . " He found the butt in a dresser drawer , lighted up , inhaled deeply . His eyelids lowered . " Manna from Heaven , " he said slowly . " You know what manna is , doll ? " " A food , " she said . " From the Bible . " " Right on , " he said lazily . " But they did n't call it womanna , did they ? Manna . You give good head , doll ? " " I do n't know , " she said truthfully , not understanding . " Sure you do , " he said . " All you old , ' hungry dames do . And if you do n't know how , I 'll teach you . But that comes later . Let 's get with it . Off with the uniform , doll . " It was more of a cot than a bed , the thin mattress lumpy , sheet torn and blotched . He would not let her turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself , could only block out what was happening by closing her eyes . But that was not enough . He smelled of sweat and the awful , musky scent he was wearing . And he was so hairy , so hairy . He wore a singlet of black wire wool that covered chest , shoulders , arms , back , legs . His groin was a tangle . But his buttocks were satiny . " Oh , " she had cried out . " Oh , oh , oh . " " Good , huh ? " he said , grunting with his effort . " You like this ... and this . . . and this ? Oh God ! " Moaning , just as Maddie Kurnitz had advised . And Remedial Moaning . Zoe Kohler did as she had been told . Going through the motions . Threshing about . Digging nails into his meaty shoulders . Pulling his hair . " So good ! " she kept crying . " So good ! " Wondering if she had remembered to turn off the gas range before she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and she heaved up to meet him , she recalled her ex-husband Kenneth and his fury at her mechanical response . The Third Deadly Sin 91 " You 're just not there ! " he had complained . Finally , finally , the hairy thing lying atop her and punishing her with its weight , finished with a sob , and almost immediately rolled away . He lighted the toke again , a roach now that he impaled on a thin wire . " That was something , " he said . " Was n't that something ? " " The best I 've ever had , " she recited . " You made it ? " " Of course , " she lied . " Twice . " " What else ? " he said , smiling complacently . " Have n't had any complaints yet . " " I 've got to go , " she said , sitting up . " Oh no , " he said , pushing her back down . " Not yet . We 've got some unfinished business . " Something in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not threatening her . It was the brute confidence . Kenneth had suggested it once , but she had refused . Now sh could not refuse . He clamped her head between his strong hanr  --  s and guided her mouth . " Now you 're getting it , " he instructed her . " Up . Down . 1'hat 's it . Around . Right there . The tongue . It 's all in knowing how , doll . Fake it easy with the teeth . " Later , on her way home in a cab , she had realized that she did n't even know his name and he did n't know hers . That was some comfort . " More wine ? " she asked Ernest Mittle . " Your glass is empty . " " Sure , " he said , smiling . " Thank you . We might as well finish the bottle . I 'm really enjoying this . " She rose , staggered just briefly , giddy from the memory , not the wine . She brought more ice cubes from the kitchen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ' images . With their watery coloring , pinched frames , their soft , wistful vulnerability , they could have been brother and sister. " ' 1'his is better than standing on line to see a movie , " he said . " It was probably no good anyway . " 92 Lawrence Sanders " Or going to some crowded party , " she said . " Everyone getting drunk as fast as they can  --  like at Maddie 's . " " I suppose you go out a lot ? " " I really do prefer a quiet evening at home , " she said . " Like this . " " Oh yes , " he agreed eagerly . " One gets tired of running around . I know I do . " They stared at each other , blank-eyed liars . He broke first . " Actually , " he said in a very low voice , " I do n't go out all that much . Very rarely , in fact . " " To tell you the truth , " she said , not looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm alone most of the time . " He looked up , intent . He hunched forward . " That 's why'l enjoy seeing you , Zoe , " he said . " I can talk to you . When I do go to a party or bar , everyone seems to shout . People do n't talk to each other anymore . I mean about important things . " " That 's very true , " she said . " Everyone seems to shout . And no one has good manners either . No common courtesy . " " Yes ! " he said excitedly . " Right ! Exactly the way I feel . If you try to be gentle , everyone thinks you 're dumb . It 's all push , rush , shove , walk over anyone who gets in your way . I , for one , think it 's disgusting . " She looked at him with admiration . " Yes , " she said , " I feel the same way . I may be old-fashioned , but  --  " " No , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sit home by myself , " she went on , " with a good book or something tasteful on educational TV  --  I 'd rather do that than get caught up in the rat race . " " I could n't agree more , " he said warmly . " Except ... " " Except what ? " she asked . " Well , look , you and I work in the most frantic city in the world . And I wonder  --  I 've been thinking a lot about this lately  --  that in spite of the way I feel , if it is n't getting to me . I mean , theThe Third Deadly Sin 93noise , the anger , the frustration , the dirt , the violence . Zoe , they 've got to be having some effect . " " I suppose , " she said slowly . " What I mean , " he said desperately , " is that sometimes I feel I ca n't cope , that I 'm a victim of things I ca n't control . It 's all changing so fast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answer ? To drop out and go live in the wilderness ? Who can afford that ? Or to try to change things ? I do n't believe an individual can do anything . It 's just just forces . " He drew a deep breath , drained off his wine . He laughed shakily . " I 'm probably boring you , " he said . " I 'm sorry . " " You 're not boring me , Ernest . " " Ernie . " " You 're not boring me , Ernie . What you said is very interesting . You really think we can be influenced by our environment ? Even if we recognize how awful it is and try to  --  to rebel against it ? " " Oh yes , " he said . " Definitely . Did you take any psychology courses ? " " Two years . " " Well , then you know you can put rats in a stress situation  --  loud noise , overcrowding , bad food , flashing lights , and so forth  --  and drive them right up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more intelligence than rats . We have the ability to know when we are in a stress situation , and can make a conscious effort to endure it , or escape it . But I still say that what is going on about us today , in the modern world , is probably affecting us in ways we 're not even aware of . " " Physically , you mean ? Affecting us physically ? " " ' That , of course . Polluted air , radiation , bad water , junk food . But what 's worse is what 's happening to us , the kind of people we are . We 're changing , Zoe . I know we are . " " flow are we changing ? " " Getting harder , less gentle . Our attention span is shortening. 94 Lawrence SandersWe ca n't concentrate . Sex has lost its significance . Love is a joke . Violence is a way of life . No respect for the law . Crime does pay . Religion is just another cult . And so forth and so on . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doom ! " She went back to what fascinated her most . " And feeling this way , " she said , " knowing all this , you still feel that you are being changed ? " He nodded miserably . " The other night , " he said , " I was eating my dinner in front of the TV set . Franks and beans . With a can of beer . I was watching the evening news . They had films from the refugee camps in Thailand . The Cambodians . " I sat there eating and drinking , and saw kids , babies , with pipe-stem arms and legs , and swollen bellies , flies on their eyes . I sat there eating my franks and beans , drinking my beer , and watched people dying . And after a while I discovered I was crying . " " I know , " she said sympathetically . " It was terrible . " " No , no , " he said in anguish . " That was n't why I was crying  --  because it was so terrible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I was watching those pictures , and I knew they were true , and those people really were dying , and I did n't feel a thing . I just ate my franks and beans , drank my beer , and watched a TV show . But I did n't feel anything , Zoe . I swear , I did n't feel anything . That 's what I mean about this world changing us in ways we do n't want to be changed . " Suddenly , without warning , his eyes brimmed over , and he began to weep . She watched him helplessly for a moment , then held her arms out to him . He stumbled over to collapse next to her on the couch . She put an arm about his thin shoulders , drew him close . With her other hand she smoothed the fine flaxen hair back from his temples . " There , " she said in a soft , crooning voice . " There , Ernie . There . There . " In the days following Zoe Kohler 's phoned tip to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the newspaper with avid interest . But nothing appeared other than a few brief follow-ups on the slaying of Frederick Wolheim at the Hotel Pierce . Soon , even this case disappeared from the paper . Zoe was convinced a cover-up was in effect . As Everett Pinckney had said , it was n't good for the hotel business . Hotels advertised in newspapers . The economy of the city was based to a large extent on tourism . So the newspapers were silent . But on March 24th , a two-column article appeared in the Times ' Metropolitan Report . Headlined : KILLER SOUGHT IN TWO HOMICIDES , it reviewed the murders of George T. Puller and FrederickWolheim , pointing out the similarities , and said the police were working on the theory that both killings were committed by the same person . The motive was unknown . The Times ' article reported that the investigation was under the command of Detective Lieutenant Martin Slavin . He had stated : " We are exploring several promising leads , and an arrest is expected shortly . " A special phone number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crimes . The Times did not mention the Son of Sam killings , but the afternoon Post and the evening 's Daily News were not so restrained . The Post headline was : ANOTHER SON OF SAM ? The News bannered their page 4 report with : cops CALL DAUGHTER OF SAM ' A POSSIBILITY . Both papers suggested the police were afraid that the Puller and Wolheim murders might be just the first of a series of psychopathic , motiveless slayings . Both papers repeated LieutenantSlavin 's statement : " We are exploring several promising leads , and an arrest is expected shortly . " After a brief initial shock , Zoe Kohler decided she had nothing to fear from Slavin 's optimistic prediction ; it was intended to t e  --  assure New Yorkers that everything that could be done was being done , and this menace to the public safety would soon be eliminated . More worrisome was the Daily News ' reference to " Daughter of Sam . " But a careful reading of the story indicated that the police96 Lawrence Sanderswere merely investigating the possibility that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whores and their pimps were being rousted and questioned in record numbers . So , Zoe Kohler felt , nothing had been discovered that really threatened her . It was , she admitted , becoming increasingly exciting . All those policemen running around . Millions of newspaperreaders titillated and frightened . She was becoming someone . Her exhilaration was dampened two days later when Everett Pinckney came into her office with a notice that had been handdeliveredby the police to the chiefs of security in every hotel in midtown Manhattan . It was , in effect , a WANTED poster , asking the security officers to aid in apprehending the killer of George T. Puller and Frederick Wolheim . It was believed the murderer made contact with the victims in the bars , cocktail lounges , or dining rooms of hotels , especially those hosting conventions , sales meetings , or large gatherings of any type . The description of the person " wanted for questioning " was sparse . It said only that the suspect could be male or female , approximately 5 ' 5 " to 5 ' 7 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Not much to go on , " Pinckney said . " If we grabbed every man and woman wearing a black nylon wig , we 'd really be in the soup . Can you imagine the lawsuits for false arrest ? " " Yes , " Zoe said . " Well , " Mr. Pinckney said , studying the notice , " the two murders happened around midnight . I 'll make sure Joe Levine sees this when he comes on at five tonight . Then I 'll leave it on my desk . If I miss Barney McMillan in the morning , will you make sure he sees it ? " " Yes , sir , " she said . When he was gone , she sat upright at her desk , spine rigid , her back not touching her chair . She clasped her hands on the desktop . Knuckles whitened . The black nylon wig did n't bother her . That was a detail thatThe Third Deadly Sin 97could be remedied . But how had they come up with the correct height ? She went over and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recall nothing that would give the police an accurate estimation of her height . She had a shivery feeling that there was an intelligence at work of which she knew nothing . Something or someone secret who knew . She wondered if it might be a medium or someone versed in ESP , called in by the police to assist in their investigation . " I see a man or woman with  --  yes , it 's black hair . No , not hair  --  it 's a wig , a black nylon wig . And this person is of average height . Yes , I see that clearly . About five-five to five-seven . Around there . " That might have been how it was done . Zoe Kohler nodded , convinced ; that was how . On Thursday night , she went down to Wigarama on 34th Street . She tried on a nylon , strawberry blond wig , styled just like her black one . She looked in the mirror , pulling , tugging , poking it with her fingers . " It 'll make you a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm sure it will , " Zoe Kohler said , and bought it . Madeline Kurnitz called and insisted they meet for lunch . Zoe was wary ; a lunch with Maddie could last more than two hours . " I really should n't , " she said . " I 'm a working woman , you know . I usually eat at my desk . " " Come on , kiddo , " Maddie said impatiently . " You 're not chained to the goddamned desk , are you ? Live a little ! " " How about right here ? " Zoe suggested . " In the hotel dining room ? " " How tacky can you get ? " Maddie said disgustedly . When she showed up , twenty minutes late , she was wearing her ranch mink , so black it was almost blue , over a tight sheath of brocaded satin . The dress had a stain in front ; a side seam gapped . She could n't have cared less . She led the way grandly into the Hotel Granger dining room. 98 Lawrence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sad smile . " Two , ladies ? " he said in sepulchral tones . " This way , please . " He escorted them to a tiny table neatly tucked behind anenormous plaster pillar . Maddie Kurnitz opened her coat and put a soft hand on his arm . " You sweet man , " she said , " could n't we have a table just a wee bit more comfortable ? " His eyes flicked to her unholstered breasts . He came alive . " But of course ! " he said . He conducted them to a table for four in the center of the dining room . " Marvelous , " Maddie caroled . She gave the maitre d ' a warm smile . " You 're a perfect dear , " she said . " My pleasure ! " he said , glowing . " Enjoy your luncheon , ladies . " He helped Maddie remove her mink coat , touching her tenderly . Then he moved away regretfully . " I made his day , " Maddie said . " How do you do it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'd never have the nerve . " " Balls , luv , " Maddie advised . " All it takes is balls . " As usual , her hair seemed a snarl , her makeup a blotch of primary colors . Her feral teeth shone . Diamonds glittered . She dug into an enormous snakeskin shoulder bag and came out with a crumpled pack of brown cigarillos . She offered it to Zoe . " No , thank you , Maddie . I 'll have one of my own . " " Suit yourself . " Maddie twirled a cigarillo between her lips . Instantly , a handsome young waiter was hovering over her , snapping his lighter . She grasped his hand to steady the flame . " Thank you , you beautiful man , " she said , smiling up at him . " May we have a drink now ? " " But of course , madam . What is your pleasure ? " " I 'd tell you , " she said , " but it would make you blush . For a drink , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with two olives . Zoe ? " The Third Deadly Sin 99 " A glass of white wine , please . " The waiter scurried off with their order . Maddie looked around the crowded room . " Never in my life have I seen so many women with blue hair , " she said . " What 's the attraction here  --  free Geritol ? " " The food is very good , " Zoe said defensively . " Let me be the judge of that , kiddo . " She regarded Zoe critically . " You do n't look so bad . Not so good , but not so bad . Feeling okay ? " " Of course . I 'm fine . " " Uh-huh . Have a good time at our bash the other night ? " " Oh yes . I meant to thank you before I left , but I could n't find you . Or Harry . " " Never did meet David something , did you ? The guy I told you about ? " " No , " Zoe said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lucky , " Maddie said , laughing . " He was picked up later that night with a stash of coke on him . The moron ! But you did n't leave alone , did you ? " Zoe Kohler hung her head . The waiter came bustling up with their drinks and left menus alongside their plates . " Whenever you 're ready , ladies , " he said . " I 'm always ready , " Maddie said , " but we 'll order in a few minutes . " They waited until he moved away . " How did you know ? " Zoe asked . " My spies are everywhere , " Maddie said . " What 's his name ? " " Ernest Mittle . He works for your husband . " Madeline Kurnitz spluttered into her martini . " Mister Meek ? " she said . " That nice little man ? " " He 's not so little . " " I know , sweetie . He just looks little . Did n't try to get into your pants , did he ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Of course not . He 's not like that at all . " 100 Lawrence Sanders " Did n't think so , " Maddie said . " Poor little mouse . " " Could we order , Maddie ? I really have to get back to work . " Zoe ordered a fresh fruit salad . Maddie would have the fresh oysters . Bluepoints were n't her favorite , but they were the only kind available . On each oyster she wanted a spoonful of caviar topped with a sprinkling of freshly ground ginger . Then she would have thin strips of veal sauteed in unsalted butter and Marsala wine , with a little lemon and garlic . Cauliflowerwith bacon bits would be nice with that , she decided . And a small salad of arrugola with sour cream and chives . The ordering of her luncheon took fifteen minutes and required a conference of maitre d ' , headwaiter , and two waiters , with a busboy hovering in the background . All clustered about Maddie , peered down her neckline , and conversed volubly in rapid Italian . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wished she were elsewhere . Finally their meals were served . Maddie sampled one of her oysters . The waiters watched anxiously . " Magnifico ! " she cried , kissing the tips of her fingers . They relaxed with grins , bowed , clapped each other on the shoulder . " So-so , " Maddie said to Zoe Kohler in a low voice . " The oysters are a bit mealy , but those dolts were so sweet , I did n't have the heart . . . Want to try one ? " " Oh no ! Thank you . " " Still popping the pills , kiddo ? " " I take vitamins , " Zoe said stiffly . " Food supplements . " Maddie finished the oysters , sat back beaming . " Not bad , " she admitted . " Not the greatest , but not bad . By the way , " she added , " this is on me . I should have told you ; maybe you 'd have ordered a steak . " " We 'll go Dutch , " Zoe said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Harry 's company . This is a business lunch in case anyone should ask . " She laughed . The Third Deadly Sin 101She had another martini while waiting for her veal . Zoe hadanother glass of white wine . Then their entrees were served . " Beautiful , " Maddie said , looking down at her plate . " You'vegot to order for color as well as taste . Is n't that a symphony ? " " It looks nice . " Maddie dug in , sampled a slice of veal . She closed her eyes . " I 'm coming , " she said . " God , that 's almost as good as a high colonic . " She attacked her lunch with vigor . " Sweetie , " she said , while masticating , " I never asked you about your divorce . Never . Did I ? " " No , you never did . " " If you do n't want to talk about it , just tell me to shut my yap . But I 'm curious . Why the hell did you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whatever . I thought you two had the greatest love affair since 1 litler and Eva Braun . That 's the way your letters sounded . What happened ? " " Well . . . ah . . . " Zoe Kohler said , picking at her salad , " we just drifted apart . " " Bullshit , " Madeline Kurnitz said , forking veal into her mouth . " Can I guess ? " " Can I stop you ? " Zoe said . " No way . My guess is that it was the sex thing . Am I right ? " " Well . . . maybe , " Zoe said in a low voice . Maddie stopped eating . She sat there , fork poised , staring at the other woman . " He wanted you to gobble ze goo ? " she asked . " What ? " " Chew on his schlong , " Maddie said impatiently . Zoe looked about nervously , fearing nearby diners were tuned in to this discomfiting conversation . No one appeared to be listening . " ' That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " There were other things . " 102 Lawrence SandersMaddie resumed eating , apparently sobered and solemn . She kept her eyes on her food . " Sweetie , " she said , " were you cherry when you got married ? " " Yes . " " After all I told you at school ? " Maddie said , looking up angrily . " I tried to educate you , for God 's sake . Stupid , stupid , stupid ! Well , how was it ? " " How was what ? " " The wedding night , you idiot . The first bang . How was it ? " " It was n't the greatest adventure I 've ever had , " Zoe Kohler said dryly . " Did you make it ? " " He did . I did n't , no . " Maddie stared long and thoughtfully at her . " Have you ever made it ? " " No . I have n't . " " What ? Speak up . I did n't hear that . " " No , I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in silence . Maddie pushed her plate away , belched , relighted the butt of her cigarillo . She looked at Zoe with narrowed eyes through a plume of smoke . " Poor little scut , " she said . " Sweetie , I know this wonderful woman who treats women like  --  " " There 's nothing wrong with me , " Zoe Kohler said hotly . " Of course there is n't , luv , " Maddie said soothingly . " But it 's just a shame that you 're missing out on one of the greatest pleasures of this miserable life . This woman I know holds classes . Small classes . Five or six women like you . She explains things . You have discussions about what 's holding you back . She gives you exercises and things to do by yourself at home . She 's got a good track record for helping women like you . " " It 's not me , " Zoe Kohler burst out . " It 's the men . " " Uh-huh , " Maddie said , squashing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you this woman 's name . " " No , " Zoe said . The Third Deadly Sin 103Maddie Kurnitz shrugged . " Then let 's have some coffee , " she suggested . " And some rich , thick , fattening dessert . " She was conscious of other things happening to her . Not only the acceleration of time , and the increasing intrusion of the past into the present so that memories of ten or twenty years ago had the sharp vividness of the now . She was also beginning to see reality in magnified close-ups , intimate and revealing . She had seen the pores in Maddie 's nose , the nubby twist of Mr. Pinckney 's tweed suit , the fine grain of the paper money in her purse . But not only the visual images . All her senses seemed more alert , tender and receptive . She heard new sounds , smelled new odors , felt textures that were strange and wonderful . All of her was becoming more perceptive , open and responsive to stimuli . It seemed to her that she could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a scent . She twanged with this new sensitivity . She saw herself as raw , touched by life in marvelous and sometimes frightening ways . She wondered that if this growing awareness increased , she might not develop X-ray vision and the ability to communicate with the dead . A universe was opening up to her , unfolding and spreading like a bloom . It had never happened to anyone before , she knew . She was unique . It had all started with her first adventure , a night of fear , anguish and resolve . Then , when it was over , she was flooded with a warm peace , an almost drunken exaltation . When she had returned home , she had stared at herself in a mirror and was pleased with what she saw . It seemed to her that , for self-preservation , she could not , should not stop . She was rational enough to recognize the dangers , to plan coldly and logically . But logic was limited . It was not an end in itself , a way of life . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life . The gratification was not sexual . Oh no , it was not that , although she loved those men for what they had given her . But104 Lawrence Sandersshe did not experience an orgasm or even a thrill when she  --  when those men went . But she felt a thawing of her hurts . The adventures were a sweet justification . Of what , she could not have said . " It 's God 's will , " her mother was fond of remarking . If a friend sickened , a coffee cup was broken , or a million foreigners died in a famine  --  " It 's God 's will , " her mother said . Zoe Kohler felt much the same way about what she was doing . It was God 's will , and her newfound sensibility was her reward . She was being allowed to enter a fresh world , reborn . Dr. Oscar Stark , an internist , had his offices on the first floor of his home , a converted brownstone on 35th Street just east of Park Avenue . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the front door said to have been designed by Louis Tiffany . The suite of offices consisted of a reception room , the doctor 's office , two examination rooms , a clinic , lavatories , storage cubicles , and a " resting room . " All these chambers had the high , ornate ceilings , wood paneling , and parquet floors installed when the home was built in 1909 . The waiting room and the doctor 's office were equipped with elaborate , marble-manteled fireplaces . There were window seats , wall niches , and sliding oak doors . Dr. Stark and his wife of forty-three years had found it impossible to reconcile this Edwardian splendor with the needs of a physician 's office : white enameled furniture , stainless steel equipment , glass cabinets , and plastic plants . Regretfully , they had surrendered to the demands of his profession and moved their heavy antiques and gloomy paintings upstairs to the living quarters . Dr. Stark employed a receptionist and two nurses , both RNs . His waiting room was invariably occupied , and usually crowded , from 9:00 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ; the doctor sometimes saw patients early in the morning , late in the evening , and on weekends . The Third Deadly Sin 105Zoe Kohler had a standing appointment for 6:00 P.M. on the first Tuesday of every month . Dr. Stark had tried to convince her that these monthly visits were not necessary . " Your illness does n't require it , " he had explained with his gentle smile . " As long as you keep on the medication faithfully , every day . Otherwise , you 're in excellent health . I 'd like to see you twice a year . " " I 'd really prefer to get a checkup every month , " she said . " You never can tell . " He shrugged his meaty shoulders , brushed cigar ashes from the lapels of his white cotton jacket . " If it makes you feel better , " he said . " What is it , exactly , you 'd like me to do for you every month ? " " Oh . . . " she said , " the usual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Weight and blood pressure . The lungs . Urine and blood tests . Breast examination . A pelvic exam . A Pap test . " " A Pap smear every month ? " he cried . " Zoe , in your case it 's absolutely unnecessary . Once or twice a year is sufficient , I assure you . " " I want it , " she said stubbornly , and he had yielded . He was a short , blunt teddy bear of a man in his middle sixties . An enormous shock of white hair crowned his bullet head like a raggedy halo . And below , ruddy , pendulous features hung in bags , dewlaps , jowls , and wattles . All of his thick face sagged . It waggled when he moved . His hands were wide and strong , fingers fuzzed with black hair . I le wore carpet slippers with white cotton socks . Unless a patient objected , he chain-smoked cigars . More than once his nurse had plucked a lighted cigar from his fingers as he was about to start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a sweet old man with eyes of Dresden blue . He did not frighten her or intimidate her . She s bought she might tell him anything , anything , and he would not he shocked , angered , or disgusted . On the first Tuesday of that April , the first day of the month , 106 Lawrence SandersZoe Kohler arrived at Dr. Stark 's office a few minutes early for her 6:00 P.M. appointment . Mercifully , there were only two other patients in the waiting room . She checked in with the receptionist , then settled down with a year-old copy of Architectural Digest . It was 6:50 before Gladys , the chief nurse , came into the reception room and gave Zoe as pleasant a smile as she could manage . " Doctor will see you now , " she said . Gladys was a gorgon , broad-shouldered and wide-hipped , with a faint but discernible mustache . Zoe had once seen her pick up a steel cabinet and reposition it as easily as if it had been a paper carton . Dr. Stark had told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a military academy in Virginia . She lived alone with four cats . A few moments later Zoe Kohler was seated in Dr. Stark 's office , watching him light a fresh cigar and wave the cloud of smoke away with backhand paddle motions . He peered at her genially over the tops of his half-glasses . " So ? " he said . " Feeling all right ? " " Fine , " she said . " Regular bowel movements ? " She nodded , lowering her eyes . " What about your food ? " " I eat well , " she said . He looked down at the opened file Gladys had placed on his desk . " You take vitamins , " he noted . " Which ones ? " " Most of them , " she said . " A , B-complex , C , E , and some minerals . " " Which minerals ? " " Iron , zinc , magnesium . " " And ? What other pills ? " " My birth control pill , " she said . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " And ? " The Third Deadly Sin 107 " Sometimes a Librium . Midol . Anacin . Occasionally a Darvon for my cramps . A Tuinal when I ca n't sleep . " He looked at her and sighed . " Oy gevalt , " he said . " What a stew . Believe me , Zoe , if you 're eating a balanced diet the vitamins and minerals and that seaweed just are n't needed . " " Who eats a balanced diet ? " she challenged . " What about the choline ? Why choline ? " " I read somewhere that it prevents premature senility . " He leaned back and laughed , showing strong , yellowed teeth . " A young woman like you , " he chided , " worrying aboutsenility . Me , I should be worrying . Try to cut down on the pills . All right ? " " All right , " she said . " You promise ? " She nodded . " Good , " he said , pushing a buzzer on his desk . " Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minute . " In the examination room , she took off all her clothes and put them on plastic hangers suspended from the top edge of a threepaneledmetal screen . She draped a sheet about herself . Gladys came in with an examination form fastened to a clipboard . Zoe stepped onto the scale . Gladys moved the weights back and forth . " One twenty-three , " she announced . " How do you do it ? One of ' my legs weighs one twenty-three . Better put on your shoes , dear ; the floor is chilly . " She handed Zoe a wide-mouthed plastic cup . " The usual contribution , please , " she said , motioning toward the lavatory door . Zoe went in there and tried . Nothing . In a few moments Gladys opened the door a few inches . " Having trouble ? " she asked . " Run some warm water on your hands and wrists . " Zoe did as directed , and it worked . She came back into the108 Lawrence Sandersexamination room bearing half a cup of warm urine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had poured half of it down the sink . She handed the cup to Gladys without looking at her . Dr. Stark came in a few moments later . He set his cigar carefully aside . Zoe sat in an armless swivel chair of whiteenameledsteel . The doctor sat on a swivel stool facing her . His bulk overflowed the tiny seat . " All right , " he said , " let 's get this critical operation going . " The nurse handed a stethoscope to Stark . He motioned Zoe to drop the sheet . She slid it from her shoulders , held it gathered about her waist . He warmed the stethoscope on his hairy forearm for a moment , then applied the metal disk to Zoe 's chest , sternum , ribcage . " Deep breath , " he said . " Another . Another . " She did as he commanded . " Fine , fine , fine , " he said . He spun her chair around and moved the plate over her shoulders , back . He rapped a few times with his knuckles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he reported . He hung the stethoscope around his neck and reached to Gladys without looking . The nurse had the sphygmomanometer ready and waiting . Stark wrapped the cuff about Zoe 's upper arm and pumped the bulb . Gladys leaned down to take the readings . " A little high , " the doctor noted . " Just a tiny bit . Nothing to worry about . Now let 's do the Dracula bit . " Gladys handed him the syringe and needle . She swabbed the inside of Zoe 's forearm . Zoe looked away . She felt Dr. Stark 's strong fingers feeling deftly along her arm . He found a vein ; the needle went in unerringly . He had a light , butterfly touch . Still she felt the needle pierce , her body penetrated . Her tainted blood drained away . In a few moments , the doctor pressed her arm , withdrew the needle and full syringe . He handed it to Gladys . The nurse set it aside , applied a small , round adhesive patch to the puncture in Zoe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the fun part , " Dr. Oscar Stark said . He hitched his wheeled stool closer and stared critically at Zoe Kohler 's naked bosom through his half-glasses . He began to palpate her breasts . She hung her head . Through half-closed eyes she watched his furred fingers moving over her flesh . Like black caterpillars . He used the flats of his wide fingertips , moving his hand in a small circle to feel the tissue under the skin . He examined each breast thoroughly , probing to the middle of her chest and under her arms . He finished by squeezing each nipple gently to detect exudation . By that time , Zoe Kohler had her eyes tightly shut . " A-Okay , " Stark said . " You can wake up now . Do you examine your breasts yourself , Zoe ? " " Uh . . . no , I do n't . " " Why not ? I showed you how . " " I , ah , rather have it done by a doctor . A professional . " " Uh-huh . Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You 'd be surprised at how many women I 'm getting with their boobs down to their knees . If you start to jog , make sure you wear a firm bra . All right , let 's ride the iron pony . " Gladys assisted her onto the padded examination table , adjustedthe pillow under her head . She placed Zoe 's heels in the stirrups , smoothed the sheet to cover her body down to the waist . l ) r . Stark , propelling himself with his feet , wheeled over to place himself between Zoe 's legs . The nurse helped him into rubber gloves . He leaned close , peering . He examined the vulva , using one hand to open the entrance to the vagina . He pushed back the clitoral hood . Then he reached sideways , and the nurse smacked a plastic speculum into his palm . " ' Fell me if it hurts , " the doctor said . " It should n't ; it 's your size . " I le inserted the speculum slowly and gently , pressing with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guide the instrument . Once inserted , the handle was turned to spread and lock the110 Lawrence Sandersblades . They locked with an audible click . Zoe was expecting the sound , but could n't resist twitching when she heard the crack . " All right ? " Dr. Stark asked . " Fine , " she said faintly . She stared at the ceiling , biting on her lower lip . She felt no pain . Only the humiliation . " Relax , " he said . " It 'll help if you try to relax . You 're all rigid . Take deep breaths . " She tried to relax . She thought of blue skies , fair fields , calm waters . She breathed deeply . " Spatula , " the doctor said in a low voice . She felt nothing , but knew he was getting the Pap smear , the plastic spatula scraping cells from her cervix . Part of Zoe Kohler ravaged and removed from her . Stark and the nurse worked swiftly , efficiently . In a moment , the spatula was withdrawn , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Something , a stretched fullness , was subsiding . Then Dr. Oscar , that sweet , sweet teddy bear of a man , was standing between her legs . " Do n't tense up , " he cautioned . He inserted two gloved fingers into her vagina slowly , pressingthe walls apart as he went . He placed his other hand flat on hergroin . Fingers pressed gently upward , palm downward . " Pain ? " he asked . " No , " she gasped . " Tenderness ? " " No . " He began to probe her abdomen , feeling both sides , the center , down toward the junction of her thighs . " Pain here ? " " No . " " Anything here ? " " No . " " Here ? " " No.  --  The Third Deadly Sin 111 " Just another minute now . " She waited , knowing what was coming . Slowly , easily , he inserted one gloved finger , coated with a jelly , into her rectum . Between that finger and the one still within her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passages as the fingertips of his other hand pressed deep into her groin . She had been staring wide-eyed at the ceiling . She was determined not to cry . It was not the pain ; she felt no pain . A twinge now and then , a sensation of being stretched , opened to the foreign world , but no pain . So why did she have to fight to hold back her tears ? She did not know . Slowly , easily , gently , fingers and hands were withdrawn . Dr. Stark stripped off his gloves . He slapped her bare knee lightly . " Beautiful , " he said . " Not a thing wrong . You 're in great shape . Get dressed and stop by my office . " He reclaimed his cigar and lumbered out . Gladys helped her off the table . Her legs were trembling . The big nurse held her until her knees steadied . " Okay ? " she asked . " Fine . Thank you , Gladys . " " There are tissues in the bathroom if you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the doctor 's when you 're dressed . " She put on her clothes slowly . Drew a comb through her hair . She felt drained and , somehow , satisfied and content . Dr. Stark was slumped behind his desk , his glasses pushed up atop that cloud of snowy hair . He rubbed his lined forehead wearily . " Everything looks normal , " he reported to Zoe . " We 'll have the reports of the lab tests in three days . I do n't anticipate anything unusual . If there is , I 'll call . If not , I wo n't . " " Can I call ? " she asked anxiously . " If I do n't hear from you ? In three or four days ? " " Sure , " he said equably . " Why not ? " Ile put the short stub of his cigar aside . He yawned , showing those big , stained teeth . Then he laced his fingers comfortably across his thick middle . He regarded her kindly. 112 Lawrence Sanders " Regular periods , Zoe ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Twenty-six or - seven or - eight days . Around there . " " Good , " he said . " When 's the next ? " " April tenth , " she said promptly . " Still have the cramps ? " " Yes . " " When do they start ? " " A day or two before . " " Severe ? " " They get worse . They do n't stop until I begin to bleed . " He made an expression , a wince , then shook his head . " I told you , Zoe , I ca n't find any physical cause . I wish you'dtake my advice and see , uh , a counselor . " " Everyone wants me to see a shrink ! " she burst out . He looked up sharply . " Everyone ? " She would n't look at him . " A friend . " " And what did you say ? " " No . " He sighed . " Well , it 's your body and your life . But you should n't have to suffer that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're not so bad , " she said . But they were . At about 8:30 that evening , Dr. Oscar Stark pushed a button fixed to the doorjamb of his office . It rang a buzzer upstairs in the kitchen and alerted his wife that he 'd be up in ten or fifteen minutes , ready for dinner . He had already said goodnight to his receptionist and nurses . He took off his white cotton jacket . He washed up in one of the lavatories . He donned a worn velvet smoking jacket , so old that the elbows shone . He wandered tiredly through the first floor offices , turning off lights , making certain the drug cabinet was locked , trying doors and windows . He climbed the broad staircase slowly , pulling himself along with the banister . Once again he vowed that he would retire inThe Third Deadly Sin 113two years . Sell the practice and the building . Spend a year breaking in the new man . Then he and Berthe would leave New York . Buy a condominium in Florida . Most of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left . He and Berthe deserved some rest . At peace . In the sun . He knew it would never happen . That night Berthe had prepared mushroom-and-barley soup , his favorite , and a pot roast made with first-cut brisket . His spirits soared . He had a Scotch highball and lighted a cigar . " It was a hard day ? " his wife asked . " No better or worse than usual , " he said . She looked at him narrowly . " That Zoe Kohler woman ? " she said . He was astonished . " You know about her ? " " Of course . You told me . " " I did ? " " Twice , " she said , nodding . " The first Tuesday of every month . " " Oh-ho , " he said , looking at her lovingly . " Now I understand the mushroom-and-barley soup . " " The first Tuesday of every month , " Berthe said , smiling . " To revive you . Oscar , you think she . . . Well , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me so . " " Yes , " he said seriously , " that 's so . But not her . For her it 's painful . " " Painful ? It hurts ? You hurt her ? " " Oh no , Berthe . No , no , no . You know me better than that . But I think it 's a kind of punishment for her . That 's how she sees it . " Punishment for what ? Has she done something ? " " Such a question . How would I know ? " " Come , let 's eat . " ' They went into the dining room . It was full of shadows . " I do n't think she 's done something , " he tried to explain . " I114 Lawrence Sandersmean , she does n't want punishment because she feels guilty . I think she feels unworthy . " " My husband the psychologist . " " Well , that 's what I think it is , " he repeated stubbornly . " She comes every month for an examination she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ punishment for her unworthiness . That 's how she gets her gratification . " " Sha , " his wife said . " Put your cigar down and eat your soup . " The cramps were bad . None of her pills helped . The pain came from deep within her , in waves . It wrenched her gut , twisted her inside . It was a giant hand , clawing , yanking this way and that , turning her over . She wanted to scream . She left work early on Wednesday night , April 9th . Mr. Pinckney was sympathetic when she told him the cause . " Take tomorrow off , " he said . " We 'll manage . " " Oh no , " she said . " I 'll be all right tomorrow . " She went directly home and drew a bath as hot as she could endure . She soaked for an hour , running in more hot water as the tub cooled . She searched for telltale stains , but the water remained clear ; her menses had not yet started . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dressed . She did n't care what Dr. Stark said ; she was convinced they were helping her survive . And she sipped a glass of white wine while she dressed . The cramps had diminished to a dull , persistent throbbing . She regretted the necessity of going up to the Filmore on West 72nd Street to put on makeup and don her new strawberry blond wig . But she did n't want to risk the danger of having her neighbors and doorman see her transformed . Also , there was a risk of going directly from her apartment house to the Hotel Coolidge . The cabdriver might remember . A circuitous route was safer . She had selected the Coolidge because the hotel trade magazine , in its directory of conventions and sales meetings , had listedThe Third Deadly Sin 115the Coolidge as hosting two conventions and a political gathering on the night of April 9th . It was an 840-room hotel on Seventh Avenue and 50th Street . Close enough to Times Square to get a lot of walk-in business in its cocktail lounges and dining rooms . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sheer pantyhose with a reddish tint , her evening sandals with their " hookers ' heels . " The dress , tightly fitted , was a bottle-green silk so dark it was almost black . It shimmered , and was skimpy as a slip , suspended from her smooth shoulders by spaghetti straps . Two hours later she was seated alone at a small banquette in the New Orleans Room of the Hotel Coolidge . Her trenchcoat was folded on the seat beside her . She was smoking a cigarette and sipping a glass of white wine . She did not turn her head , but her eyes were never still . It was a small , dimly lighted room , half-filled . A three-piece band played desultory jazz from a raised platform in one corner . It was all relatively quiet , relaxed . Zoe Kohler wondered if she might do better in the Gold Coast Room . Most of the men who entered were in twos and threes , hatless and coatless , but bearing badges on the lapels of their suit jackets . They invariably headed directly for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small tables , but not many . Shortly after 11:00 P.M. , a single man came to the entrance of the New Orleans Room . He stood a moment , looking about . Come to me , Zoe Kohler willed . Come to me . He glanced in her direction , hesitated , then moved casually toward the wall of banquettes . Lover , she thought , not looking at him . He slid behind the table next to hers . She pulled her shoulder bag and trenchcoat closer . The cocktail waitress came over and he ordered a bourbon and water . His voice was a deep , resonant baritone . He was tall , more than six feet , hunched , and almost totally bald . He wore rimless spectacles . His features were pleasant116 Lawrence Sandersenough , his cheeks somewhat pitted . The backs of his hands were badly scarred . He wore the ubiquitous name-badge on his breast pocket . Zoe caught a look at it . HELLO ! CALL ME JERRY . They sat at their adjoining tables . She ordered another glass of wine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in each other 's direction . Finally .. . " I beg your pardon , " he said , leaning toward her . She turned to look coldly at him . He blushed , up into his bald head . He seemed about to withdraw . " Uh , I , ah , uh , wondered if I could ask you a personal question ? " " You may ask , " she said severely . " I may or may not answer . " " Uh , " he said , gulping , " that dress you 're wearing . . . It 's so beautiful . I want to bring my wife a present from New York , and she 'd look great in that . " He added hastily , " Not as good as you do , of course , but I wondered where you bought it , and if ... " His voice trailed away . She smiled at him . " Thank you  --  " She peered closer at his badge as if seeing it for the first time . " Thank you , Jerry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shop where I bought it has gone out of business . " " Oh , " he said , " that 's too bad . But listen , maybe you can suggest a store where I can buy something nice . " Now they had turned to face each other . He kept lifting his eyes from her shoulders and cleavage , and then his eyes would slide down again . They talked awhile , exploring . He was from Little Rock , Arkansas , and was regional manager for a chain of fast-food restaurants that sold chicken-fried steaks and was about to go the franchise route . She touched the scars on the backs of his hands . " What happened ? " she asked . " A war wound ? " " Oh no , " he said , laughing for the first time . He had a nice , sheepish laugh . " A stove caught fire . They 'll heal . Eventually . " " My name 's Irene , " she said softly . He bought them two more rounds of drinks . By that time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoulder bag to her other side , and he was sitting beside her , at her table . She pressed her thigh against his . He drew his leg hastily away . Then it came back . The New Orleans Room had filled up , every table taken . Patrons were standing two and three deep at the bar . The jazz trio was playing with more verve , music blasting . The distracted waitresses were scurrying about . Zoe Kohler was reassured ; no one would remember her . " Noisy in here , " Jerry said , looking about fretfully . " We ca n't rightly talk . " " Where are you staying , Jerry ? " she asked . " What ? " he said . " Snow again ; I do n't get your drift . " She put her lips close to his ear . Close enough to touch . She repeated her question . " Why , uh , right here in the hotel , " he said , shaken . " The fourteenth floor . " " Have anything to drink in your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sippin ' whiskey , " he said , staring at her . " Bourbon . " She put her lips to his ear again . " Could n't we have a party ? " she whispered . Her tongue darted . " I 've never done anything like this before , " he said hoarsely . " I swear , I never have . " There was one other couple in the automatic elevator , but they got off on the ninth floor . Jerry and Irene rode the rest of the way alone . " Notice they got no thirteenth floor ? " he said nervously . " It goes from twelve to fourteen . I guess they figure no one would want a room on the thirteenth . Bad luck . But I 'm on the fourteenth which is really the thirteenth . Makes no never-mind to Inc . She put a hand on his arm . " You 're sweet , " she said . " No kidding ? " he said , pleased . Inside his room , the door locked , he insisted on showing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his Labrador retriever , 118 Lawrence Sandersnamed Boots . Zoe looked at what she thought were a dumpy blonde , a naked development house with no landscaping , and a beautiful dog . " Jerry , you 're a very lucky man , " she said , handling the photos by the edges . " Do n't I know it ! " " Children ? " " No , " he said shortly . " No children . Not yet . " She thought he was in his late thirties , maybe forty . No children . That was too bad . But his widow would remarry . Zoe was sure of it ; she had that look . He rummaged in his open suitcase and came up with an almost full pint bottle of bourbon . " Voila ! " he said , pronouncing it , " Viola . " Zoe did n't know if he was making a joke or not . " I think I 'll skip , " she said . " All that white wine has got me a tiny bit tipsy . But you go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'm sure . " He poured a small shot into a water glass . His hand was trembling ; the bottle neck rattled against the rim of the glass . " Listen , " he said , not looking at her , " I told you I 've never done anything like this before , and that 's God 's own truth . I got to be honest with you ; I do n't know whether you ... " He looked at her helplessly . She went over to him , held him by the arms , smiled up at him . " I know what you 're wondering , " she said . " You 're wondering if I want money and if you should pay me before or after . Is n't that so ? " He nodded dumbly . " Jerry , " she said gently , " I 'm not a professional , if that 's what you think . I just enjoy being here with you . If a man wants to give me a little gift later because he 's had such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said swallowing . " I understand . " " You 've got a radio ? " she said briskly . " Turn on the radio . Let 's get this show on the road . " The Third Deadly Sin 119He turned on the bedside radio . The station was playing disco . " Wow , " she said , snapping her fingers , " that 's great . Do you like to dance ? " He took a gulp of bourbon . " I 'm not very good at it , " he said . " Then I 'll dance by myself , " she said . She began to move about the room , dipping , swaying , her hips moving . Her arms were extended overhead , fingers still snapping . She bowed , writhed , twisted , twirled . Her heels caught in the heavy shag rug . A shoulder strap slipped off and hung loose . He sat on the edge of the bed , touching the bourbon to his lips , and watched her with wondering eyes . " Too many clothes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she sashayed over to him , turned her back , and motioned . " Open me up , " she commanded . Obediently , he drew her back zipper down . It hissed . She slid off the remaining strap , let her dress fall , stepped out . She tossed it onto a chair . She stood there a moment , facing him , in her heart-flecked lingerie , reddish pantyhose , high heels . They stared at each other . Then the music changed to a tango . She began to swoop and glide about the room . " I swear to God , " he said , his voice a croak , " this is the damndest thing that ever happened to me . Irene , you are one beautiful lady . I just ca n't believe it . " " You better believe it , " she said , laughing . " It 's true . " She continued dancing for him until the music ended . An announcer came on , talking about motor oil . Zoe Kohler took off her sandals , wiggled out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Jerry , " she said . Ile raised his head , looked at her . " You like ? " she said , posing with hands on her waist , weight on mu leg . She cocked her head quizzically . I k nodded . He looked frightened and miserable . She went over to him , stood close , between his legs . She pressed his head120 Lawrence Sandersbetween her palms , pulled his face into her soft , scented belly . " You get out of all those clothes , honey , " she said throatily . " I have to go make wee-wee . Be back in a minute . " She took her shoulder bag and headed for the bathroom . She glanced back , but he was n't looking at her . He was staring at the floor again . She made her usual preparations , thinking that he was a difficult one . He did n't come on . He was troubled . He had no confidence . That was n't fair . She came out of the bathroom naked , towel draped over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " she said gaily . He was n't lying naked under the sheet . He had taken off only his jacket and vest , had loosened his tie and opened his collar . He was still sitting on the edge of the bed , hunched over , elbows on knees . He was turning his glass around and around in his scarred hands . Now it was filled with whiskey , almost to the brim . When he heard her voice , he turned to look over his shoulder . " Good lord a'mighty , " he said with awe . She came over to the bed , on the other side . She kneeled behind him . With her left hand , she pulled him gently back until he was leaning against her , pressing her breasts , stomach , thighs . " Jerry , " she said , " what 's wrong ? " He groaned . " Irene , this is no good . I just ca n't do it . I 'm sorry , but I ca n't . Listen , I 'll give you money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I think of my little girl waiting at home for me , I just ca n't ... " Shh , shh , " she said soothingly . She put the soft palm of her left hand on his brow and drew his head back toward her , between her breasts . " Do n't think about that . Do n't think about a thing . " She let the towel fall free . She plunged the point of the knife blade below his left ear and pulled it savagely to the right , tugging when it caught . His body leaped convulsively off the bed . Glass fell . Drink spilled . He went flopping to the floor , limbs flailing . That was n't what surprised her . The shock was the fountain ofThe Third Deadly Sin 121blood , the giant spurt , the wild gush . It had gone out so far that gobbets had hit the . wall and were beginning to drip downward . She watched those trickles for a brief moment , fascinated . Then she scrambled across the bed and stood astride him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , eyelids fluttering . He was clothed , but it made no difference . She did n't want to see that knobbed thing , that club . She drove the blade through his clothing into his testicles , with the incantation , " There . There . There . " After a while she straightened up , looked about dully . Nothing had changed . She heard , dimly , traffic sounds from Seventh Avenue . An airliner droned overhead . Someone passed in the outside corridor ; a man laughed . Next door , a toilet flushed . She looked down at Jerry . He was gone , his life soaked into the carpet . The bedside radio was still playing . Disco again . She went into the bathroom for sheets of toilet paper before she handled the radio knob , stopping the music . She was so careful . Edward X. Delaney found himself obsessed with the puzzle of the two hotel deaths . He tried to turn his mind to other concerns , to keep himself busy . Inevitably , his thoughts returned to the murder of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was done , who might have done it . Sighing , he surrendered to the challenge of the mystery , put his feet on his desk , smoked a cigar , and stared at the far wall . Everything in his cop 's instinct and experience told him it was the work of a criminal psychopath , a crazy , a nut . It was almost hopeless to try to imagine a motive . But it did n't seem to be greed ; nothing had been stolen . On impulse , he searched through the pages of an annual diary and appointment book , looking for the section that listed phases of the moon . There was no connection between the full moon and the dates of the slayings . He slammed the desk drawer in disgust . The problem was , there was no brilliantly deductive way to approach a case in which a random killer selected victims by chance and murdered for apparently no reason . There was no handle , nowhere to start . Because , Delaney told himself , he had nothing better to do , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to recall everything122The Third Deadly Sin 123Sergeant Abner Boone had told him . Then he headed a third sheet : Perpetrator . He pored over the known facts about the two victims , trying to find a link , a connection . He found nothing other than what he had mentioned to Boone : they were both middle-aged men , visitors to New York , staying at midtown hotels . That , he knew , meant next to nothing . But in his meticulous way , he made a careful note of it . The sheet of paper devoted to the killer had few notations : 1 . Could be male or female. 2 . Wears black nylon wig. 3 . Clever ; careful ; crafty if not intelligent . Just writing all this down gave him a certain satisfaction . It brought a solution no closer , he knew , but it was a start in bringing order and form to a chaotic enigma . It was the only way he knew to apply logic to solving a crime born of abnormal motives and an irrational mentality . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ March 21t , ruminating about the case . He was playing with the idea that perhaps the two victims , George T. Puller and Frederick Wolheim , had , at some time in their business careers , employed the same man , and had fired this man , for whatever reasons . Then , years later , the discharged employee , his resentment turned to homicidal fury , had sought out his two former employers and slashed them to death . A fanciful notion , the Chief acknowledged , but not impossible . In fact , not farfetched at all . He was still considering this possibility and how it might be Decked out when his phone rang . He reached for it absently . " Edward X. Delaney here , " he said . " Chief , this is Boone , " the sergeant said . " I thought you 'd like to know . . . I did what you said : took a Crime Scene Unit man hick to the room at the Hotel Pierce where Wolheim was chilled . We took measurements on that armchair where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sanders " And ? " " Chief , it was approximate . I mean , when you sit in that chair , it has a soft seat cushion that depresses . You understand ? So it was tough getting an exact measurement from the back of the head to the tailbone . " " Of course . " " Anyway , " Boone went on , " we did what we could . Then there was no one in the Lab Services Unit or ME 's office who could help . But one of the assistant ME 's suggested we call a guy up at the American Museum of Natural History . He 's an anthropologist , supposed to be a hotshot on reconstructing skeletons from bone fragments . " " Good , " Delaney said , pleased with Boone 's thoroughness . " What did he say ? " " I gave him the measurement and he called back within an hour . He said his estimate  --  and he insisted it was only a guess  --  was that the person who sat in that chair was about five feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Chief ? " Boone said . " You still there ? " " Yes , sergeant , " Delaney said slowly , " I 'm still here . Five-five to five-seven ? That could be a smallish man or a tallish woman . " " Right , " the sergeant said . " But it 's something , is n't it , Chief ? I mean , it 's more than we had before . " " Of course , " Edward X. Delaney said , as heartily as he could . He did n't want to say how frail that clue was ; the sergeant would know that . " How are you getting along with Slavin ? " " Okay , " Boone said , lowering his voice . " So far . He 's been making us recheck everything we did before he came aboard . I guess I can understand that ; he does n't want to be responsible for anything that happened before he took command . " " Uh-huh , " Delaney said , thinking that Slavin was a fool to waste his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their professional competence . " Chief , I 'd like to ask you a favor ... " " Of course . Anything . " The Third Deadly Sin 125 " Could I call you about the investigation ? " the sergeant asked , still speaking in a muffled voice . " Every once in a while ? To keep you up on what 's going on and ask your help on things ? " That would be Deputy Commissioner Ivar Thorsen 's suggestion , the Chief knew . " Sergeant , why do n't you call Delaney every day or so ? You 're friends , are n't you ? Keep him up on the progress of the investigation . See if he has any ideas . " Which meant that Thorsen did n't entirely trust the expertise of Lieutenant Martin Slavin . " Call me any time you like , sergeant , " Edward X. Delaney said . " I 'll be here . " " Thank you , sir , " Boone said gratefully . Delaney hung up . On the dossier headed Perpetrator , he added : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the kitchen and made a sandwich of sliced kielbasa and Jewish coleslaw , on sour rye . Since it was a " wet " sandwich , he ate it standing over the sink . There was one person Edward X. Delaney was eager to talk to -- -but he was n't sure the old man was still alive . He had been Detective Sergeant Albert Braun , assigned to the office of the District Attorney of New York County . But he had retired about fifteen years ago and Delaney lost track of him . Braun had joined the New York Police Department with a law degree at a time when the force was having trouble recruiting qualified high school graduates . During his first five years , he served as a foot patrolman and continued his education with special studies at local universities in criminal law , forensic science and , his particular interest , the psychology of criminal behavior . During his early years in the Department , he had won the reputation of being a dependable , if unspectacular , street cop . his nickname during this period of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t Phan Annie 's dog . That hound was n't a bulldog , but Albert Braun was  --  and that 's how he got the canine monicker . Delaney remembered that it was said of Braun that if he was126 Lawrence Sandersassigned to a stakeout in front of a house , and told , " Watch for a male Caucasian , 5-11 , 185 pounds , about fifty-five , grayish hair , wearing a plaid sport jacket , " you could come back two years later and Arf would look up and say , " He has n't shown up yet . " Finally , Albert Braun 's background , erudition , and intelligence were recognized . He earned the gold shield of a detective , received rapid promotions , and ended up a sergeant in the Manhattan DA 's office where he remained until his retirement . Long before that , he was recognized as the Department 's top expert in the history of crime . He possessed a library of more than 2,000 volumes on criminology , and his knowledge of old cases , weapons , and criminal methodology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ police departments outside New York City and even by foreign police bureaus and Interpol . In addition , he taught a popular course on investigative techniques to detectives of the NYPD and was a frequent guest lecturer at John Jay College of Criminal Justice . Delaney remembered that Braun had never married , and lived somewhere in Elmhurst , in Queens . The Chief consulted his personal telephone directory , a small , battered black book that contained numbers so ancient that instead of a three-digit prefix some bore designations such as Murray Hill-3 , Beekman-5 , and Butterfield-8 . He found Albert Braun 's number and dialed . He waited while the phone rang seven times . He was about to hang up when a woman came on the line with a breathless " Yes ? " " Is this the Albert Braun residence ? " Delaney asked . " Yes , it is . " He did n't want to ask anything as crude as , " Is the old man still alive ? " He tried , " Is Mr. Braun available ? " " Not at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calling , please ? " " My name is Edward X. Delaney . I 'm an old friend of Mr. Braun . I have n't seen or spoken to him in years . I hope he 's in good health ? " " Not very , " the woman said , her voice lowering . " He fell andThe Third Deadly Sin 127broke his hip about three years ago and developed pneumonia from that . Then last year he had a stroke . He 's recovering from that , somewhat , but he spends most of his time in bed . " " I 'm sorry to hear it . " " Well , he 's doing as well as can be expected . A man of his age . " " Yes , " Delaney said , wanting to ask who she was and what shewas doing there . She answered his unspoken question . " My name is Martha Kaslove . Mrs. Martha Kaslove , " she addedfirmly . " I 've been Mr. Braun 's housekeeper since he fell . " " Well , I 'm glad he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had hoped totalk to him , but under the circumstances I wo n't bother him . I'dappreciate it if you 'd tell him I called . The name is Edward X.  --  " " Wait a minute , " she said . " You knew him when he was apoliceman ? Before he retired ? " " Yes , I knew him well . " " Mr. Braun does n't have many visitors , " she said sadly . " None , in fact . He does n't have any family . Oh , neighbors stop by occasionally , but it 's really to visit with me , not him . I think a visit from an old friend would do him the world of good . Would you be willing to . . . ? " " Of course , " Delaney said promptly . " I 'll be glad to . I 'm in Manhattan . I could be there in half an hour or so . " " Good , " she said happily . " Let me ask him , Mr. Laney . " " Delaney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Hang on just a minute , please , " she said . He hung on for several minutes . Then Mrs. Kaslove came back on the phone . " He wants to see you , " she reported . " He 's all excited . He'seven putting clothes on and he wants me to shave him . " " Wonderful , " the Chief said , smiling at the phone . " Tell him I 'm on my way . " Ile made sure he had his reading glasses , notebook , two ballpoint pens , and a sharpened pencil . He pulled on his heavy , navy-blue melton overcoat , double-breasted . He set his hard black homburg squarely atop his big head . Then he went128 Lawrence Sanderslumbering over to a liquor store on Second Avenue where he bought a bottle of Glenlivet Scotch . He had it gift-wrapped and put in a brown paper bag . He stopped an empty northbound cab , got in , closed the door . He gave Albert Braun 's address in Elmhurst . The driver turned around to stare at him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said . " Sure you do , " Edward X. Delaney said genially . " Or we can go to the Two-five-one Precinct House , just a block away . Or , if you prefer , you can take me downtown to the Hack Bureau and I 'll swear out a complaint there . " " Jesus Christ ! " the driver said disgustedly and slammed the cab into gear . They made the trip in silence , which was all right with Delaney . He was rehearsing in his mind the questions he wanted to ask Albert Braun . It was a pleasant house on a street of lawns and trees . In spring and summer , Delaney thought , it would look like a residential street in a small town , with people mowing the grass , trimming hedges , poking at flower borders . He had almost forgotten there were streets like that in New York . She must have been watching for him through the front window , for the door opened as he came up the stoop . She filled the doorway : a big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Mr. Delaney ? " she said in a warm , pleasing voice . " Yes . You must be Mrs. Kaslove . Happy to meet you . " He took off his homburg . They shook hands . She ushered him into a small entrance hall , took his hat and coat , hung them away in a closet . " I ca n't tell you how he 's looking forward to your visit , " she said . " I have n't seen him so alive and chirpy in months . " " If I had known ... " " Now you must realize he 's been a very sick man , " she rattled on , " and not be shocked at the way he looks . He 's not bedridden , but when he gets up , he uses a wheelchair . He 's lost a lot ofThe Third Deadly Sin 129weight and the left side of his face  --  you know  --  from the stroke ... " Delaney nodded . " An hour , " she said definitely . " The doctor said he can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to upset him . " " I wo n't upset him , " the Chief said . He held up his brown paper bag . " Can he have a drink ? " " One weak highball a day , " she said firmly . " You 'll find glasses in his bathroom . Now I 'm going to run out and do some shopping . But I 'll be back long before your hour is up . " " Take your time , " Delaney said , smiling . " I wo n't leave until you get back . " " His bedroom is at the head of the stairs , " she said , pointing . " On your right . He 's waiting for you . " The Chief took a deep breath and climbed the stairs slowly , looking about . It was a cheerful , informal home . Patterned wallpaper . Lots of chintz . Bright curtains . Some good rugs . Everything looked clean and shining . The man in the bedroom was a bleached skeleton propped up iii a motorized wheelchair parked in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his lap and legs and was tucked in at the sides . A fringed paisley shawl was draped about his bony shoulders . He wore a starched white shirt , open at the neck to reveal slack , crepey skin . His twisted face wrenched in a grimace . Delaney realized that Albert Braun was trying to grin at him . He stepped forward and picked up the man 's frail white hand and pressed it gently . It felt like a bunch of grapes , as soft and tender . " How are you ? " he asked , smiling . " Getting along , " Braun said in a wispy voice . " Getting along . I low are you , Captain ? I thought you 'd be in uniform . How are things at the precinct ? The usual hysteria , eh ? " Delaney hesitated just a brief instant , then said , " You 're right . I the usual hysteria . It 's good to see you again , Professor . " " Professor , " Braun repeated , his face wrenching again . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me Professor . " 130 Lawrence Sanders " You are a professor , " Delaney said . " I was , " Braun said , " I was . But not really . It was just a courtesy , an honorary title . It meant nothing . Detective Sergeant Albert Braun . That 's who I was . That meant something . " The Chief nodded understandingly . He held out the brown paper bag . " A little something to keep you warm . " Braun made a feeble gesture . " You did n't have to do that , " he protested . " You better open it for me , Captain . I do n't have much strength in my hands these days . " Delaney tore the wrappings away and held the bottle close to the man in the wheelchair . " Scotch , " Braun said , touching the bottle with trembling fingers . " What makes the heart grow fonder . Let 's have one now for old times ' sake . " " I thought you 'd never ask , " Delaney said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bathroom to mix drinks . He poured himself a heavy shot , tossed it down , and stood there , gripping the sink as he felt it hit . He thought he had been prepared , but the sight of Albert Braun had been a shock . Then he mixed two Scotch highballs in water tumblers , a weak one for the Professor , a dark one for himself . He brought the drinks back into the bedroom . He made certain Braun 's thin fingers encircled the glass before he released it . " Sit down , Captain , sit down , " the old man said . " Take that armchair there . I 've got the cushions all broke in for you . " Edward X. Delaney sat down gingerly in what seemed to him to be a fragile piece of furniture . He hoisted his glass . " Good health and a long life , " he toasted . " I 'll drink to good health , " Braun said , " but a long life is for the birds . All your friends die off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Say , whatever happened to Ernie Silverman ? Remember him ? He was with the ... " Then they were off and running  --  twenty minutes of reminiscences , mostly gossip about old friends and old enemies . Braun did most of the talking , becoming more garrulous as he touched the watery highball to his pale lips . Delaney did n't see himThe Third Deadly Sin 131swallowing , but noted the level of liquid was going down . Then the old man 's glass was empty . He held it out in a hand that had steadied . " That was just flavored water , " he said . " Let 's have another with more kick to it . " Delaney hesitated . Braun stared at him , face mangled into a gargoyle 's mask . All his bones seemed to be knobby , pressing out through parchment skin . Feathers of grayish hair skirted his waxen skull . Even his eyes were filmed and distant , gaze dulled and turned inward . Black veins popped in his sunken temples . " I know what Martha told you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Right ? " " Right , " Delaney said . Still he hesitated . " She keeps the booze downstairs , " the skeleton complained . " I ca n't get at it . I 'm eighty-four , " he added in a querulous tone . " The game is up . You think I should be denied ? " Edward X. Delaney made up his mind . He did n't care to analyze his motives . " No , " he said , " I do n't think you should be denied . " He took Braun 's glass , went back to the bathroom . He mixed two more Scotch-and-waters , middling strong . He brought them into the bedroom , and Braun 's starfish hand plucked the glass from his hand . The old man sampled it . " That 's more like it , " he said , leaning back in his wheelchair . Ile observed Delaney closely . The cast over his eyes had faded . Ile had the shrewd , calculating look of a smart lawyer . " You did n't come all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said . " No . I did n't . " " Old Iron Balls ,  --  Braun said affectionately . " You always did have the rep of using anyone you could to break a case . " " ' That 's right , " Delaney agreed . " Anyone , anytime . There is something I wanted to ask you about . A case . It 's not mine ; a It iend 's ass is on the line and I promised I 'd talk to you . " " What 's his name ? " 132 Lawrence Sanders " Abner Boone . Detective Sergeant . You know him ? " " Boone ? Boone ? I think I had him in one of my classes . Was his father a street cop ? Shot down ? " " That 's the man . " " Sure , I remember . Nice boy . What 's his problem ? " " It looks like a repeat killer . Two so far . Same MO , but no connection between the victims . Stranger homicides . No leads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said excitedly , leaning forward . " What a case that was ! Did you work that one , Captain ? " " No , " Delaney said shortly , " I never did . " " I was retired then , of course , but I followed it in the papers and on TV every day . Made notes . Collected clippings . I had a crazy idea of writing a book on it some day . " " Not so crazy , " Delaney said . " Now this thing that Boone caught is  --  " " Fascinating case , " Albert Braun said slowly . His head was beginning to droop forward on the skinny stem of his neck . " Fascinating . I remember the last lecture I gave at John Jay was on that case . Multiple random homicides . The motives . . . " His loose dentures clacked . " Yes , yes , " Delaney said hurriedly , wondering if he was losing the man . " That 's what I wanted to talk to you about  --  the motives . And also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Sam ? A woman who commits several random homicides ? " " A woman ? " the old man said , raising his head with an effort . " It 's all in my lecture . " " Yes , " Delaney said , " but could you tell me now ? Do you remember if there was ever a case like Son of Sam when a woman was the perp ? " " Martha Beck , " Braun said , trying to recall . " A woman in Pennsylvania  --  what was her name ? I forget . But she was a babysitterand knew the victims . All kids . A woman at a Chicago fair , around the turn of the century , I think . I 'd have to look it up . She ran a boardinghouse . Killed her boarders . Greed , again . " His face tried to make a grin . " Ground them up into sausages . " The Third Deadly Sin 133 " But stranger homicides , " Delaney insisted . " Any woman involved in a series of killings of strangers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Albert Braun said sadly . " Two days later I fell . The steps were n't even slippery . I just tripped . That 's how it ends , Captain ; you trip . " He held out his empty glass . Delaney took it to the bathroom , mixed fresh highballs . When he brought the drinks back to the bedroom , he heard the outside door slam downstairs . Braun 's head had fallen forward , sharp chin on shrunken chest . " Professor ? " the Chief said . The head came up slowly . " Yes ? " " Here 's your drink . " The boiled fingers clamped around . " That lecture of yours , " Delaney said . " Your last lecture . Was it written out ? Typed ? " The head bobbed . " Would you have a copy of it ? I 'd like to read it . " Albert Braun roused , looking at the Chief with eyes that had a spark , burning . " Lots of copies , " he said . " In the study @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a metal box fixed to the arm of his wheelchair . He began to move slowly toward the doorway . Delaney stood hastily , hovered close . But Braun maneuvered his J pair skillfully through the doorway , turned down the hallway . 1 ' he Chief moved nearby , ready to grab the old man if he toppled . But he did n't . He steered expertly into the doorway of a darkened room and stopped his chair . " Switch on your right , " he said in a faint voice . Delaney fumbled , found the wall plate . Light blazed . It was a long cavern of a room , a study-den-library . Rough , unpainted Dille bookshelves rose to the ceiling . Bound volumes , some in ant lent leather covers . Paperbacks . Magazines . Stapled and pho-134 Lawrence Sanderstocopied academic papers . One shelf of photographs in folders . There was a ramshackle desk , swivel chair , file cabinet , typewriteron a separate table . A desk lamp . A wilted philodendron . The room had been dusted ; it was not squalid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long unused . The desktop was blank ; the air had a stale odor . It was a deserted room , dying . Albert Braun looked around . " I 'm leaving all my books and files to the John Jay library , " he said . " It 's in my will . " " Good , " Delaney said . " The lectures are over there in the lefthand corner . Third shelf up . In manila folders . " Delaney went searching . He found the most recent folder , opened it . At least a dozen copies of a lecture entitled : " Multiple Random Homicides ; History and Motives . " " May I take a copy ? " he asked . No answer . " Professor , " he said sharply . Braun 's spurt of energy seemed to have depleted him . He raised his head with difficulty . " May I take a copy ? " Delaney repeated . " Take all you want , " Braun said in a peevish voice . " Take everything . What difference does it make ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Braun 's last lecture . He folded it lengthwise , tucked it into his inside jacket pocket . " We 'll get you back to your bedroom now , " he said . But there in the doorway , looming , was big , motherly Mrs. Martha Kaslove . She looked down with horror at the lolling Albert Braun and snatched the glass from his nerveless fingers . Then she looked furiously at Edward X. Delaney . " What did you do to him ? " she demanded . He said nothing . " You got him drunk , " she accused . " You may have killed him ! You get out of here and never , never come back . Do n't try to call ; The Third Deadly Sin 135I 'll hang up on you . And if I see you lurking around , I 'll call the cops and have you put away , you disgusting man . " He waited until she had wheeled Albert Braun back to his bedroom . Then Delaney turned off the lights in the study , went downstairs , and found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the living room phone . He went outside and stood on the sidewalk , waiting for the cab . He looked around at the pleasant , peaceful street , so free of traffic that kids were skateboarding down the middle of the pavement . Nice homes . Private lives . He was back in Manhattan shortly after 3:30 P.M. In the kitchen , taped to the refrigerator door  --  she knew how to communicate with him  --  was a note from Monica . She had gone to a symposium and would return no later than 5:30 . He was to put the chicken and potatoes in the oven at precisely 4:00 . He welcomed the chore . He did n't want to think of what he had done . He was not ashamed of how he had used a dying man , but he did n't want to dwell on it . There were six chicken legs . He cut them into pieces , drumsticksand thighs , rinsed and dried them . Then he rubbed them with olive oil , sprinkled on toasted onion flakes , and dusted them with garlic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the thighs skin side down ) in a disposable aluminum foil baking pan . He washed and dried the four Idaho potatoes . He rubbed them with vegetable oil and wrapped them in aluminum foil . Monica and he could never eat four baked potatoes , but the two left over would be kept refrigerated , sliced another day , and fried with butter , chopped onions , and lots of paprika . Good homefries . He set the oven for 350  --  and put in chicken and potatoes . He searched in the fridge for salad stuff and found a nice head of romaine . He snapped it into single long leaves , washed them , wrapped them in a paper towel . Then he put them back into the t efrigerator to chill . He and Monica liked to eat romaine leaf by leaf , dipped into a spicy sauce. 136 Lawrence SandersHe made the sauce , a tingly mixture of mayonnaise , ketchup , mustard , Tabasco , salt , pepper , garlic powder , and parsley flakes . He whipped up a bowl of the stuff and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cook ; he knew that . He smoked too much and drank too much ; his palate was dulled . That was why he overspiced everything . Monica complained that when he cooked , sweat broke out on her scalp . He had accomplished all his tasks in his heavy , vested sharkskin suit , a canvas kitchen apron knotted about his waist . Finished , he untied the apron , took an opened can of Ballantine ale , and went into his study . He settled down , took a sip of the ale , donned his reading glasses . He began to read Detective Sergeant Albert Braun 's last lecture . He read it twice . Between readings , he went into the kitchen to turn the chicken , sprinkling on more toasted onion flakes and garlic and parsley salt . And he opened another ale . Multiple Random HomicidesHistory and Motivesby Albert Braun , Det . Sgt. , NYPD , Ret . " Good evening , ladies and gentlemen .. . " The homicide detective , in establishing the guilt or innocence of a suspect must concern himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opportunity , and motive . The criminal may choose his weapon and select his opportunity . His motive can not be manipulated ; he is its creature . And it is usually motive by which his crime succeeds or fails . " What are we to make of the motive of New York 's current multiple murderer  --  an individual described in headlines as The .44 Caliber Killer ' or Son of Sam ' ? The former title refers to the handgun used to kill six and wound seven  --  to date . The latter is a self-awarded nickname used by the killer in taunting notes to the police and press and , by extension , to all of us . " The detective 's mind at work : He calls himself Son of Sam . ' Invert to Samson , who lost his potency when his long hair wasThe Third Deadly Sin 137shorn . Then we learn the victims had long hair . A connection here ? A clue ? No , I do not believe so . Too tenuous . But it illustrates how every possibility , no matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the criminal 's motive or plural motives . " In researching the murky drives of the wholesale killer , the detective goes to the past history of similar crimes , and finds literature on the topic disturbingly scant . Rape , robbery , even art forgery have been thoroughly studied , analyzed , charted , computerized , dissected , skinned , and hung up to dry . " But where are the psychologists , criminologists , sociologists , and amateur aficionados of murder most foul when it comes to resolving the motives of those who kill , and kill again , and again , and again . . . ? " Good reason for this , I think . Cases of mass homicide are too uncommon to reveal a sure pattern . Each massacre is different , each slaughter unique . Where is the link between Jack the Ripper , Charles Manson , Unruh , the Black Dahlia , Speck , the Boston Strangler , Panzram , William Heirens ( ' Stop me before I kill again ! ' ) , Zodiac ( never caught , that one ) , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bag ' butchers , the homosexualkillers in Houston , the executioner of the California itinerant workers ? What do all these monsters have in common ? " They were all quite mad , ' you say . An observation of blinding brilliance rivaled only by John F. Kennedy 's , Life is unfair . ' " No , the puzzling denominator is that they are all male . Where are the ladies in this pantheon of horror ? Victims frequently , killers never . Oh , there was Martha Beck , true , but she worked ' with a male paramour and slaughtered from corruptive greed . Shoddy stuff . " We are not here concerned with greed as a motive forinultiple homicide . Nor shall we muse on familial tensions whicherupt in the butchery of an entire Nebraska family or Kentuckyclan , including in-laws and , oddly enough , usually the family dog . " What concerns us this evening is a series of isolated murders , lrequcutly over a lengthy period of time , the victims unrelated138 Lawrence Sandersand strangers to the slayer . Let us also eliminate political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not enough to intone , Paranoiac schizophrenic , ' and let it go at that . It may satisfy a psychologist , but should not satisfy the homicide detectivesince labels are of no use to him in solving the case . " What , then , should the detective look for ? What possible motives for random slayings may exist that will help him apprehend the perpetrator ? " Pay attention here ; watch your footing . We are in a steamy place of reaching vines , barbed creepers , roots beneath and swamp around . Beasts howl . Motives intertwine and interact . Words fail , and the sun is blocked . Poor psychologists . Poor sociologists . No patterns , no paths . But shivery shadows  --  plenty of those . " First , maniacal lust . Oh yes . This staple of penny dreadfuls did exist , does exist and , if current statistics on rape are correct , seems likely to increase tomorrow . It might  --  and that was the first of many mights ' you will hear from me tonight  --  it might account @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Strangler , the Black Dahlia , Heirens , Speck , and others whose names , fortunately , escape me . I have a good memory for old lags , con men , outlaws and safecrackers . When it comes to recalling mass killers , my mind fuzzes over . It is , I think , an unconscious protective mechanism . The horror is too bright ; it shines a light in corners better left in gloom . " Sexual frenzy : passion becomes violence through hatred , impotence , a groaning realization of the emptiness of sex without love . Water results ; blood is wanted . Then blood is needed , and the throat-choked slayer seeks the ultimate orgasm . And aware  --  oh yes , aware !  --  and weeping for himself  --  never for his victim ; his own anguish fills him  --  he scrawls in lipstick on the bathroom mirror , Stop me before I kill again ! ' As if anyone could rein his demented desire or want to . Leave that to the hangman 's noose . It is stated that capital punishment does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revenge . It might serve for Jack the Ripper , theThe Third Deadly Sin 139Boston Strangler , Unruh , the killer of those California farmhands , the homosexual executioner in Houston  --  ah , it might serve for the whole scurvy lot , including the latest addition , Son of Sam . " Revenge , as a motive , I interpret as hatred of a type of individual or a class of individuals who , in the killer 's sick mind , are deserving of death . All women , all blacks , all homosexuals , the poor , the mighty , or attractive young girls with long brown hair . " When the New York Police Department compared ballistics reports and came to the stunned conclusion that it was up against a repeat killer , one of the first theories advanced involved the long hair of the victims . It was suggested that the murderer , having been spurned or humiliated by a girl with flowing tresses , vowed vengeance and is intent on killing her over and over again . " More recent reports demolish this hypothesis . Males @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not all the female victims had brown , shoulder-length hair . One was blonde ; others had short coiffures . " But still , revenge as a motive has validity . It has been proposed that Jack the Ripper executed and mutilated prostitutesbecause one had infected him with a venereal disease . A neat theory . Just as elegant , I believe , is my own belief : that he was the type of man who compulsively sought the company of whores ( there are such men ) and killed to eradicate his own weakness , eliminate his shame . " I told you we are in a jungle here , and nowhere does the sun shine through . We are poking around the dark , secret niches of the human heart , and our medical chart resembles antique maps with the dread legends : Terra incognita ' and Here be dragons . ' " ' Third , rejection . Closely allied to revenge , but rejection not by individual or class but by society , the world , life itself . I did n't ask to lw born , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Who did ? ' Is Son of Sam of this rejected brotherhood ? " ' There was once a mass killer named Panzram . He was an intelligent man , a thinking man , but a bum , a drifter , scorned , 140 Lawrence Sandersabused , and betrayed . He rejected , scorned , and abused in turn . And he slew , so many that it seemed he wanted to kill not people but life itself . Wipe out all humanity , then all things that pulse , and leave only a cinder whirling dead through freezing space . " That was total rejection : rejection of the killer by society , and of society by the killer . Has no one ever turned his back on you , or you to him ? We are dealing here not with another planet 's language that no one speaks on ours . The vocabulary is in us all , but we dast not give it tongue . " The flip side of rejection , real or fancied , is the need to assert : I do exist . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attention . And to make certain you do , I shall kill a baker 's dozen of those lumps who look through me on the street . Then you will recognize who I am . ' Is that what Unruh was thinking as he strolled along the New Jersey street , shooting passersby , drivers of cars , pausing to reload , stopping in stores to pot a few more ? " I am I. World , take notice ! ' First , rejection ; then , need to prove existence . Murder becomes a mirror . " Finally , punk rock , punk fashion , punk souls . Not Small is better than big , ' but Nothing is better than something . ' So , what 's new ? Surely there were a few wild-eyed Neanderthals rushing about the caves , screaming , Down with up ! ' " We can afford a low-kilowatt smile at combat boots worn with gold lame bikinis , at the splintered dissonance of punk rock , at the touching fervor with which punkists assault the establishment . We can smile , oh yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and personal habits will be preempted , smoothed , glossed , gussied-up , and sold tomorrow via 30-second commercials at highly inflated prices . " But there are a few punk souls whose nihilism is so intense , who are so etched by negativism and riddled by despair , that they will never be preempted . Never ! Anarchy was not invented yesterday ; the demons of Dostoevski have been with us always . To the man who believes Nothing is evil , ' it is but one midget step to Everything is good . ' The Third Deadly Sin 141 " The nihilist may murder to prove himself superior to the tribal taboo ( the human tribe ) : Thou shalt not kill . ' Or he may slay to prove to his victims the fallacy and ephemerality of their faith . In either case , the killer is acting as an evangelist of anarchy . It is not enough that he not believe ; he must convert  --  at the muzzle of a revolver or the point of a knife . " Because the hell of punk souls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believes , he is doomed . And so the spiritual anarchist will kill before he will acknowledge that he has spent his life in thin sneers while other , more ignorant and less cynical men have affirmed , and accepted the attendant pain with stoicism and resolve . " The acrid stink of nihilism followed Charles Manson and his merry band on all their creepy-crawlies . And a charred whiff of spiritual anarchy rises from the notes and deeds of Son of Sam . But I do not believe this his sole goad . Two or more motives are interacting here . " And that is the thought I wish to leave with you tonight . The motives of mass killers are rarely simple and rarely single . We are not earthworms . We are infinitely complex , infinitely chimerical organisms . In the case of multiple random killings , it is the task of the homicide detective to pick his way through this maze of motives and isolate those strands that will , hopefully , enable him to apprehend the murderer . " Any questions ? " ' ! ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was 4 rislp and tasty . The baked potatoes , with dabs of sweet butter and a bit of freshly ground pepper , were light and fluffy . The more for the romaine leaves was not too spicy . And there was a billed jug of California chablis on the table . But the meal was spoiled by Monica 's mood . She was silent , morose . She picked at her food or sat motionless for long moments , fork poised over her food . " What 's wrong ? " Delaney asked 142 Lawrence Sanders " Nothing , " she said . They cleaned the table , sat silently over coffee and small anise biscuits . " What 's wrong ? " he asked again . " Nothing , " she said , but he saw tears welling in her eyes . He groaned , rose , bent over her . He put a meaty arm about her shoulders . " Monica , what is it ? " " This afternoon , " she sniffled . " It was a symposium on child abuse . " " Jesus Christ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next to hers . He sat holding her hand . " Edward , it was so awful , " she said . " I thought I was prepared , but I was n't . " " I know . " " They had a color film of what had been done to those kids . I wanted to die . " " I know , I know . " She looked at him through brimming eyes . " I do n't know how you could have endured seeing things like that for thirty years . " " I never got used to it , " he said . " Never . Why do you think Abner Boone cracked up and started drinking ? " She was shocked . " Was that it ? " " Part of it . Most of it . Seeing what people are capable of . What they do to other people  --  and to children . " " Do you suppose he told Rebecca ? Why he started drinking ? " " I do n't know . Probably not . He 's ashamed of it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of feeling horror and revulsion and sympathy for the victims ? " " Cops are n't supposed to feel those things , " he said grimly . " Not if it interferes with doing your job . " " I think I need a brandy , " she said . After the brandy , and after they had cleaned up the kitchen , they both went into the study . Monica sat behind the desk . The lefthand stack of drawers was hers , where she kept her stationTheThird Deadly Sin 143ery , correspondence , notepaper , appointment books , etc . She began to write letters to the children : Eddie , Jr. , Liza , Mary , and Sylvia . When she was finished , Delaney would append short notes in his hand . Usually things like : " Hope you are well . Weather here cold but clear . How is it there ? " The children called these notes " Father 's weather reports . " It was a family joke . While Monica wrote out her long , discursive letters at the desk , Edward X. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He slowly sipped another brandy and read , for the third time , the last lecture of Albert Braun , Det . Sgt. , NYPD , Ret . What Braun had to say about motives came as no surprise . During thirty years in the Department , most of them as a detective , Delaney had worked cases in which all those motives were involved , singly or coexistent . The problem , he decided , was one that Braun had recognized when he had made a brief reference to labels satisfying the criminologist or psychologist , but being of little value to the investigating detective . An analogy might be made to a man confronting a wild beast in t he woods . An animal that threatens him with bared fangs and raised claws . In his laboratory , the biologist , the scientist , would be interested only in classifying the beast : family , genus , species . Its external appearance , bone structure , internal organs . Feeding and mating habits . From what previous animal forms it had evolved . To the man in the forest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All he knew was the fear , the danger , the threat . The homicide detective was the man in the woods . The crimittologist , psychologist , or sociologist was the man in the laboratory . The lab man was interested in causes . The man in the arena was interested in events . ' I'hat was one point Delaney found not sufficiently emphasized in Braun 's lecture . The other disappointment was lack of any %peculation on why women were conspicuously missing from the rolls of multiple killers. 144 Lawrence SandersBraun had made a passing reference to Martha Beck and other females who had killed many from greed . But a deep analysis of why random murderers were invariably male was missing . And since Braun 's lecture had been delivered , the additional cases of the Yorkshire Ripper and the Chicago homosexual butcher had claimed headlines . Both murderers were men . Delaney let the pages of the lecture fall into his lap . He took off his reading glasses , massaged the bridge of his nose . He rubbed his eyes wearily . " Another brandy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head , without looking up . He regarded her intently . In the soft light of the desk lamp , she seemed tender and womanly . Her smooth skin glowed . The light burnished her hair ; there was a radiance , almost a halo . She wrote busily , tongue poking out one cheek . She smiled as she wrote ; something humorous had occurred to her , or perhaps she was just thinking of the children . She seemed to Edward X. Delaney , at that moment , to be a perfect portrait of the female presence as he conceived it . " Monica , " he said . She looked up inquiringly . " May I ask you a question about that child abuse symposium ? I wo n't if it bothers you . " " No , " she said , " I 'm all right now . What do you want to know ? " " Did they give you any statistics , national statistics , on the incidence of child abuse cases and whether they 've been increasingor decreasing ? " " They had all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's been increasing in the last ten years , but the speaker said that 's probably because more doctors and hospitals are becoming aware of the problem and are reporting cases to the authorities . Before , they took the parents ' word that the child had been injured in an accident . " " That 's probably true , " he agreed . " Did they have any statistics that analyzed the abusers by sex ? Did more men than women abuse children , or was it the other way around ? " The Third Deadly Sin 145She thought a moment . " I do n't recall any statistics about that , " she said . " There were a lot of cases where both parents were involved . Even when only one of them was the , uh , active aggressor , the other usually condoned it or just kept silent . " " Uh-huh , " he said . " But when just one parent or relative wasthe aggressor , would it more likely be a man or a woman ? " She looked at him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Edward , I told you , there were no statistics on that . " " But if you had to guess , what would you guess ? " She was troubled . " Probably women , " she admitted finally . Then she added hastily , " But only because women have more pressures and more frustrations . I mean , they 're locked up all day with a bunch of squalling kids , a house to clean , meals to prepare . While the husband has escaped all that in his office or factory . Or maybe he 's just sitting in the neighborhood tavern , swilling beer . " " Sure , " Delaney said . " But it 's your guess that at least half of all child abusers are women  --  and possibly a larger proportion than half ? " She stared at him , suddenly wary . " Why are you asking these questions ? " she demanded . " just curious , " he said . On the morning of March 24th , Delaney walked out to buy his copy of The New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bakery on Second Avenue . By the time he got back , Monica had the kitchen table set with glasses of chilled grapefruit juice , a jar of honey , a big pot of black coffee . They made their breakfasts , settled back . He gave her the Business Day section , began leafing through the Metropolitan Report . " I ) amnn it , " she said . I lc looked up . " What 's wrong ? " " Bonds are down again . Maybe we should do a swap . " " What 's a swap ? " 146 Lawrence Sanders " The paper-value of our tax-exempts are down . We sell them and take the capital tax loss . We put the money back into taxexemptswith higher yields . We can write the loss off against gains in our equities . If we do it right , our annual income from the new tax-exempts should be about equal to what we 're getting now . Maybe even more . " He was bewildered . " Whatever you say , " he told her . " Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the article headlined : KILLER SOUGHT IN TWO HOMICIDES . " That 's Abner 's case , " he said . " The hotel killings . The newspaperswill be all over it now . The hysteria begins . " " It had to happen sooner or later , " she said . " Did n't it ? It was only a question of time . " " I suppose , " he said . But when he took the newspaper and a second cup of coffee into the study , the first thing he did was look up the phone number of Thomas Handry in his private telephone directory . Handry was a reporter who had provided valuable assistance to Delaney during Operation Lombard . The phone was picked up after the first ring . The voice was terse , harried .. . " Handry . " " Edward X. Delaney here . " A pause , then : " Chief ! How the hell are you ? " " Very well , thank you . And you ? " They chatted a few minutes , then Delaney asked : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reporter said , " you never forget a thing , do you ? " " Nothing important . " " No , I 've given up on the poetry . I was lousy and I knew it . Now I want to be a foreign correspondent . Who knows , nextweek I may want to be a fireman or a cop or an astronaut . " Delaney laughed . " I do n't think so . " " Chief , it 's nice talking to you after all these years , but I 've gotThe Third Deadly Sin 147the strangest feeling that you did n't call just to say hello . You want something ? " " Yes , " Delaney said . " There was an article on page three of the Metropolitan Report this morning . About two hotel murders . " " And ? " " No byline . I just wondered who wrote it . " " Uh-huh . In this case three guys provided information for the story , including me . Three bylines would have been too much of a good thing for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off . That 's all you wanted to know ? " " Not exactly . " " I did n't think so . What else ? " " Who made the connection ? Between the two killings ? They were a month apart , and there are four or five homicides every clay in New York . " " Chief , you 're not the only detective . Give us credit for a little intelligence . We studied the crimes and noted the similarities in the MOs . " " Bullshit , " Delaney said . " You got a tip . " Handry laughed . " Remember , " he said , " you told me , I did n't tell you . " " Phone or mail ? " Delaney asked . " Hey , wait a minute , " the reporter said . " This is more than idle curiosity . What 's your interest in this ? " Delaney hesitated . Then : " A friend of mine is on the case . He needs all the help he can get . " " So why is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Delaney said angrily . " If you wo n't  --  " " Iley , hold it , " Handry said . " I did n't say I would n't . But what do I get out of it ? " " An inside track , " Delaney said , " that you did n't have before . It may be something and it may add up to zilch . " Silence a moment . " All right , " the reporter said , " I 'll gamble . Harvey Gardner took the call . About a week ago . We 've been checking it out eversince. 148 Lawrence Sanders " Did you talk to Gardner about it ? " " Of course . The call came in about five-thirty in the evening . Very short . The caller would n't give any name or address . " " Man or woman ? " " Hard to tell . Gardner said it sounded like someone trying to disguise their voice , speaking in a low growl . " " So it could be a man or a woman ? " " Could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caller said , The same person did both of them . ' Not , It 's the same killer ' or The same guy did both of them , ' but The same person did both of them . ' What do you think ? " " I think maybe you would n't make a bad cop after all . Thanks , Handry . " " I expect a little quid pro quo on this , Chief . " " You 'll get it , " Delaney promised . " Oh , one more thing ... " " There had to be , " Handry said , sighing . " I may need some research done . I 'll pay , of course . Do you know a good researcher ? " " Sure , " Thomas Handry said . " Me . " " You ? Nah . This is dull , statistical stuff . " " I 'll bet , " the reporter said . " Listen , I 've got the best sources in the world right here . Just give me a chance . You wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Delaney said . " Nice talking to you . " " Keep in touch , " Handry said . The Chief hung up and sat a moment , staring at the phone . " The same person did both of them . " The reporter was right ; there was a false note there in the use of the word " person . " It would have to be the killer who called in the tip , or a close confederate of the killer . It seemed odd that either would say , " The same person . . . " That was a prissy way of putting it . Why did n't they say " guy " or " man " or " killer " ? He sighed , wondering why he had called Handry , why he was becoming so involved in this thing . He was a private citizen now ; it was n't his responsibility . Still . . . There were a lot of motives involved , he decided . He wanted toThe Third Deadly Sin 149 dhelp Abner Boone . His retirement was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life . There was the challenge of a killer on the loose . And even a private citizen owed an obligation to society , and especially to his community . There was one other factor , Delaney acknowledged . He was getting long in the tooth . Why deny it ? When he died , thirty years of professional experience would die with him . Albert Braun would leave his books and lectures to instruct detectives in the future . Edward X. Delaney would leave nothing . So it seemed logical and sensible to put that experience to good use while he was still around . A sort of legacy while he was alive . A living will . Detective Sergeant Abner Boone called on the morning of March 26th . He asked if he could stop by for a few moments , and Delaney said sure , come ahead ; Monica was at a feminist meeting where she was serving as chairperson for a general discussion of government-financed day-care centers . The two men had talked almost every day on the phone . Boone had nothing new to report on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ripper " in newspapers and on TV . Boone did say that Lieutenant Martin Slavin was convinced t hat the murderer was not a prostitute , since nothing had been stolen . Most of the efforts of the cops under his command were directed to rousting homosexuals , the S &M; joints in the Village , and known transvestites . " Well , " Delaney said , sighing , " he 's going by the percentages . I ca n't fault him for that . Almost every random killer of strangers has been male . " " Sure , " Boone said , " I know that . But now the Mayor 's office has the gays yelling , plus the hotel associations , plus the tourist Ix  --  ople . It 's heating up . " But when Sergeant Abner Boone appeared on the morning of March 26th , he was the one who was heated up . " Look at this , " he said furiously scaling a flyer onto Delaney's150 Lawrence Sandersdesk . " Slavin insisted on sending one of these to the head of security in every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the notice slowly . Then he looked up at Boone . " The stupid son of a bitch , " he said softly . " Right ! " the sergeant said , stalking back and forth . " I pleaded with him . Leave out that business about the black nylon wig , I said . There 's no way , no way , we 'll be able to keep that out of the papers if every hotel in midtown Manhattan knows about it . So it gets in the papers , and the killer changes his wig  --  am I right ? Blond or red or whatever . Meanwhile , all our guys are looking for someone in a black wig . It just makes me sick ! " " Take it easy , sergeant , " Delaney said . " The damage has been done ; nothing you can do about it . Did you make your objections to Slavin in the presence of witnesses ? " " I sure did , " Boone said wrathfully . " I made certain of that . " " Good , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not yours . Getting many false confessions ? " " Plenty , " the sergeant said . " Every whacko in the city . Another reason I wanted to keep that black nylon wig a secret . It made it easy to knock down the fake confessions . Now we 've got nothing up our sleeve . What an asshole thing for Slavin to do ! " " Forget it , " Delaney advised . " Let him hang himself . You 're clean . " " I guess so , " Boone said , sighing . " I do n't know what to tell our decoys now . Look for anyone in any color wig , five-five to fiveseven . That 's not much to go on . " " No , " Delaney said , " it 's not . " " We checked out that suggestion you gave me . You know  --  both victims employing the same disgruntled guy and firing him . We 're still working on it , but it does n't look good . " " It 's got to be done , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And I appreciate the lead . We 're grabbing at anything . Anything . Also , I remembered what you said about the time between killings becoming shorter and shorter . So I  --  " " Usually , " Delaney reminded him . " I said usually . " The Third Deadly Sin 151 " Right . Well , it was about a month between the Puller and Wolheim murders . If there 's a third , God forbid , I figure that going by what you say  --  what you suggest , it may be around April third . That would be three weeks after the Wolheim kill . So I 'm alerting everyone for that week . " " Wo n't do any harm , " Edward X. Delaney said . " If there is another one , " Boone said , " I 'll give you a call . You promised to come over  --  remember ? " " I remember . " But April 3rd came and went , with no report of another hotel homicide . Delaney was troubled . Not because events had proved him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nagged that this case was n't following any known pattern . There was no handle on it . It was totally different . But was n't that exactly what Albert Braun had said in his last lecture ? " Cases of mass homicide are too uncommon to reveal a sure pattern . Each massacre different , each slaughter unique . " Early on the morning of April 10th , about 7:30 , Delaney was awake but still abed , loath to crawl out of his warm cocoon of blankets . The phone shrilled . Monica awoke , turned suddenly in bed to stare at him . " Edward X. Delaney here , " he said . " Chief , it 's Boone . There 's been another . Hotel Coolidge . Can you come over ? " " Yes , " Delaney said . He got out of bed , began to strip off his pajamas . " Who was that ? " Monica asked . " Boone . There 's been another one . " " Oh God , " she said . Delaney came off the elevator on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He looked to the right . A uniformed black cop was planted in the middle of the corridor . He was swinging a nightstick from its leather thong . Beyond him , far down the long hallway , Abner Boone and a few other men were clustered about a doorway. 152 Lawrence Sanders " I 'd like to see Sergeant Boone , " Delaney told the cop . " He 's expecting me . " " Yeah ? " the officer said , giving Delaney the once-over . He turned and yelled down the corridor , " Hey , sarge ! " When Boone turned to look , the cop hooked a thumb at Delaney . The sergeant nodded and made a beckoning motion . The cop moved aside . " Be my guest , " he said . Delaney looked at him . The man had a modified Afro , a neat black mustache . His uniform fit like it had been custom-made by an Italian tailor . " Do you know Jason T. Jason ? " he asked . " Jason Two ? " the officer said , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know that big mother . He a friend of yours ? " Delaney nodded . " If you happen to see him , I 'd appreciate it if you 'd give him my best . The name is Delaney . Edward X. Delaney . " " I 'll remember , " the cop said , staring at him curiously . The Chief walked down the hallway . Boone came forward to meet him . " Sorry I 'm late , " Delaney said . " I could n't get a cab . " " I 'm glad you 're late , " the sergeant said . " You missed a mob scene . Reporters , TV crews , a guy from the Mayor 's office , the DA 's sergeant , Deputy Commissioner Thorsen , Chief Bradley , Inspector Jack Turrell  --  you know him ?  --  Lieutenant Slavin , and so on and so on . We had everyone here but the Secretary of State . " " You did n't let them inside ? " " You kidding ? Of course not . Besides , none of them wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Spoil their breakfast . They just wanted to get their pictures taken at the scene of the crime and make a statement that might get on the evening news . " " Did you tell Slavin I was coming over ? " " No , sir , but I mentioned it to Thorsen . He said , Good . ' So if Slavin comes back and gives us any flak , I 'll tell him to take it up with Thorsen . We 'll pull rank on him . " " Fine , " Delaney said , smiling . The Third Deadly Sin 153He looked around the corridor . There were two ambulance men with a folding , wheeled stretcher and body bag , waiting to take the corpse away . There were two newspaper photographers , laden with equipment . The four men were sitting on the hallway floor , playing cards . The Chief looked inside the opened door . The usual hotel room . There were two men in there . One was vacuuming the rug . The other was dusting the bedside radio for prints . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " They 'll be finished soon . The guy with the vacuum cleaner is Lou Gorki . The tall guy with glasses is Tommy Callahan . The same team that worked the Puller and Wolheim kills . They 're sore . " " Sore ? " " Their professional pride is hurt because they have n't come up with anything solid . They want this guy so bad they can taste it . ' 1'his time they rigged up that little canister vacuum cleaner with clear plastic bags . They vacuumed the bathroom , took the bag out and labeled it . Did the same thing to the bed . Then the furniture . Now Lou 's doing the rug . " " Good idea , " Delaney said . " What have you got on the victim ? " Sergeant Abner Boone took out his notebook , began to flip pages ... " Like Puller and Wolheim , " he said . " With some differences . I'he clunk is Jerome Ashley , male Caucasian , thirty-nine , and  --  " " Wait a minute , " Delaney said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boone nodded . " Got it off his driver 's license . Why ? " " I was hoping there might be a pattern  --  overweight men intheir late fifties . " " Not this guy . He 's thirty-nine , skinny as a rail , and tops sixone , at least . He 's from Little Rock , Arkansas , and works for a fast-food chain . He came to town for a national sales meeting . " " IIe1d where ? " " Right here at the Coolidge . He had an early breakfast date With a couple of pals . When he did n't show up and they got no answer on the phone , they came looking . They had a porter open the door and found him . " 154 Lawrence Sanders " No sign of forced entry ? " " None . Look for yourself . " " Sergeant , if you say there 's no sign , then there 's no sign . A struggle ? " " Does n't look like it . But some things are different from Puller and Wolheim . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off his suit packet , but that 's all . He 's on the floor , alongside the bed . His glasses fell off . His drink spilled . The way I figure it , he was sitting on the edge of the bed , relaxed , having a drink . The killer comes up behind him , maybe pulls his head back , slices his throat . He falls forward onto the floor . That 's what it looks like. a There 's blood on the wall near the bed . " " Stab wounds in the genitals ? " " Plenty of those . Right through his pants . The guy 's a mess . " The Crime Scene Unit men moved toward the door carrying their kit bags , cameras , the vacuum cleaner . " He 's all yours , " Callahan said to Boone . " Lots of luck . " " Lou Gorki , Tommy Callahan , " the sergeant said , introducing them . " This is Edward X. Delaney . " " Chief ! " Gorki said , thrusting out his hand . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Operation Lombard , with Lieutenant Jeri Fernandez . " Delaney looked at him closely , shaking his hand . " Sure you were , " he said . " You were in that Con Ed van , digging the street hole . " " Oh , that fucking hole ! " Gorki said , laughing , happy that Delaney remembered him . " I thought we 'd be down to China before that perp broke . " " See anything of Fernandez lately ? " Delaney asked . " He fell into something sweet , " Gorki said . " He 's up in Spanish Harlem , doing community relations . " " Who did he pay ? " Delaney said , and they all laughed . The Chief turned to Callahan . " What have we got here ? " he asked . The two CSU men knew better than to question why he was present . He was Boone 's responsibility . " Bupkes is what we 've got , " Callahan said . " Nothing really hot . The usual collections of latents and smears . We even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a new , very iffy technique . Might work on a strangulation . We came up with nit . " " Any black nylon hairs ? " Boone said . " Or any other color ? " " Did n't see any , " Callahan said . " But they may turn up in the vacuum bags . " " One interesting thing , " Gorki said . " Not earth-shaking , but interesting . Want to take a look ? " The two technicians led the way to the corpse alongside the bed . It was uncovered , lying on its side . But the upper torso was twisted , face turned upward . The throat slash gaped like a giant mouth , toothed with dangling veins , arteries , ganglia , muscle , stuff . Unbroken spectacles and water tumbler lay nearby . To the Chief , the tableau had the frozen , murky look of a 19th century still life in an ornate frame . One of those dark , heavily varnished paintings that showed dead ducks and hares , bloody and limp , fruit on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A brass title plate affixed to the frame : AFTER THE HUNT . He surveyed the scene . It appeared to him that the murder had happened the way Boone had described it : the killer had come up behind the victim and slashed . A dead man had then fallen from the edge of the bed . He bent to examine darkened stains in the rug . " You do n't have to be careful , " Callahan said . " We got samples of blood from the stiff , the rug , the wall . " " Chances are it 's all his , " Gorki said disgustedly . " What 's this stain ? " Delaney asked . He got down on his hands and knees , sniffed at a brownish crust on the shag rug . " Whiskey , " he said . " Smells like bourbon . " " Right , " Gorki said admiringly . " That 's what we thought . Where his drink spilled ... " Delaney looked up at Boone . " I 've got thirty men going through the hotel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " It 's brutal . People are checking in and out . Mostly out . Nobody knows a thing . The bartenders and waitresses in the '  --  co ktail lounges do n't come on till five tonight . Then we 'll ask them about bourbon drinkers . " " I Irre 's what we wanted to show you , " Gorki said . " You 'll have156 Lawrence Sandersto get down close to see it . This lousy shag rug fucked us up , but we got shots of everything that shows . " The other three men got down on their hands and knees . The four of them clustered around a spot on the rug where Gorki was pointing . " See that ? " he said . " A footprint . Not distinct , but good enough . The shag breaks it up . Tommy and I figure the perp stood over the stiff to shove the knife in his balls . He stepped in the guy 's blood and did n't realize it . Then he went toward the bathroom . The footprints get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet onto the rug . " On their hands and knees , the four of them moved awkwardly toward the bathroom , bending far over , faces close to the rug . They followed the spoor . " See how the prints are getting fainter ? " Callahan said . " But still , enough to get a rough measurement . The foot is about eight-and-a-half to nine inches long . " " Shit , " Delaney said . " That could be a man or a woman . " They looked at him in surprise . " Well . . . yeah , " Gorki said . " But we 're looking for a guy  --  right ? " Delaney did n't answer . He bent low again over the stained rug . He could just barely make out the imprint of a heel , the outside of the foot , a cluster of toes . A bare foot . " The size of the footprint is n't so important , " Callahan said . " It 's the distance between prints . The stride . Get it ? We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ length of the killer 's step . The Lab Services guys have a chart that shows average height based on length of stride . So we 'll be able to double-check that professor up at the museum to see if the perp really is five-five to five-seven . " " Nice , " Delaney said . " Very nice . Any stains on the tiles in the bathroom ? " " Nothing usable , " Gorki said , " but we took some shots just in case . Nothing in the sink , tub , or toilet drains . " The four men were still kneeling on the rug , their heads raisedThe Third Deadly Sin 157to talk to each other , when they became conscious of someone looming over them . " What the fuck 's going on here ? " an angry voice demanded . The four men lumbered to their feet . They brushed off their knees . The Chief stared at the man glowering at him . Lieutenant Martin Slavin looked like a bookkeeper who had flunked the CPA exam . " Delaney ! " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? You got no right to be here . " " That 's right , " Delaney said levelly . He started for the door . " So I 'll be on my way . " " Wait a sec , " Slavin said , putting out a hand . His voice was high-pitched , strained , almost whiny . " Wait just one goddamned sec . Now that you 're here . . . What did you find out ? " Delaney stared at him . Slavin was a cramped little man with nervous eyes and a profile as sharp as a hatchet . Bony shoulders pushed out his ill-fitting uniform jacket . His cap was too big for his narrow skull ; it practically rested on his ears . Appearances are deceiving ? Bullshit , Edward X. Delaney t bought . In Slavin 's case , appearances were an accurate tipoff to ! he man 's character and personality . " I did n't find out anything , " Delaney said . " Nothing these men ca n't tell you . " " You 'll have our report tomorrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maybe later than that , " Tommy Callahan put in . " Lab Services have a lot of tests to run . " Slavin glared at them , back and forth . Then he turned his wrath on Delaney again . " You got no right to be here , " he repeated furiously . " This is my case . You 're no better than a fucking civilian . " " Deputy Commissioner Thorsen gave his okay , " Sergeant Boone said quietly . I'he four men looked at the lieutenant with expressionless eyes. 158 Lawrence Sanders " We 'll see about that ! " Slavin almost screamed . " We 'll goddamnedwell see about that ! " He turned , rushed from the room . " He 'll never have hemorrhoids , " Lou Gorki remarked . " He 's such a perfect asshole . " Sergeant Boone walked Delaney slowly back to the elevators . " I 'll let you know what the lab men come up with , " he said . " If you think of anything we 've missed , please let me know . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Delaney said , wondering if he should tell Boone about the phoned tip to the Times and deciding against it . Handry had admitted that in confidence . " Sergeant , I hope I did n't get you in any trouble with Slavin . " " With a rabbi like Thorsen ? " Boone said , grinning . " I 'll survive . " " Sure you will , " Edward X. Delaney said . He decided to walk home . Over to Sixth Avenue , through Central Park , out at 72nd Street , and up Fifth Avenue . A nice stroll . He stopped in the hotel lobby to buy a Montecristo . A soft morning in early April . A warming sun burning through a pearly haze . In the park , a few patches of dirty snow melting in the shadows . The smell of green earth thawing , ready to burst . Everything was coming alive . He strode along sturdily , topcoat open and flapping against his legs . Hard homburg set squarely . Cigar clenched in his teeth . Joggers passed him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He savored it all  --  and thought of Jerome Ashley and his giant mouth . It was smart , Delaney figured , for a detective to go by the percentages . Every cop in the world did it , whether he was aware of it or not . If you had three suspects in a burglary , and one of them was an ex-con , you leaned on the lag , even if you knew shitallabout recidivist percentages . " It just makes common fucking sense , " an old cop had remarked to Delaney . So it did , so it did . But the percentages , the numbers , theThe Third Deadly Sin 159patterns , experience  --  all were useful up to a point . Then you caught something new , something different , and you were flying blind ; no instruments to guide you . What was it the early pilots had said ? You fly by the seat of your pants . Edward X. Delaney was n't ready yet to jettison percentages . If he was handling the Hotel Ripper case , he 'd probably be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a male killer and rounding up every homosexual with a rap sheet . But there were things that did n't fit and could n't be ignored just because they belonged to no known pattern . Delaney stopped at a Third Avenue deli , bought a few things , carried his purchases home . Monica was absent at one of her meetings or lectures or symposiums or colloquies . He was happy she was active in something that interested her . He was just as happy he had the house to himself . He had bought black bread , the square kind from the frozen food section . A quarter-pound of smoked sable , because sturgeon was too expensive . A bunch of scallions . He made two sandwiches carefully : sable plus scallion greens plus a few drops of fresh lemon juice . He carried the sandwiches and a cold bottle of Heineken into the study . He sat down behind his desk , put on his reading glasses . As he ate and drank , he made out a dossier on the third victim , Jerome Ashley , trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he himself had observed . Finished with sandwiches and beer , he read over the completed dossier , checking to see if he had omitted anything . Then he 14 ) ( ked up the number of the Hotel Coolidge and called . he told the operator that he was trying to locate Sergeant Abner Boone , who was in the hotel investigating the crime on the 14th floor . He asked her to try to find Boone and have him call 1 , to k . He left his name and number . I le started comparing the dossiers of the three victims , still - oping to spot a common denominator , a connection . They were Olen from out of town , staying in Manhattan hotels : that was all he could find.
