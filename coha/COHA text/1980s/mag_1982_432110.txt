 | Whatever happened to all those " renewable fuels " that were supposed to free America from dependence on foreign oil by using energy from the sun , wind , water and crops ? Eight years after the original Arab oil embargo dispatched angry U.S. motorists to gasoline lines ? and scientists to laboratories ? a momentary oil glut and a temporarily stable market have reduced the air of urgency about developing additional energy sources High interest rates , among other things , are making it difficult to finance energy projects , and the Reagan administration is cutting research funds and even thinking of asking Congress to repeal some tax credits that were intended to make renewable energy more competitive with oil and natural gas . Yet the subsidies , coupled with investment incentives in new tax laws , are still pumping fresh interest into the search for substitutes for fossil fuels . Here is a rundown on how four of the renewable energy sources are faring : Solar : Still Hot The nation 's fledgling solar-energy industry is growing rapidly despite high borrowing rates . Underpinned by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equipment in 1980 more than doubled the 150 million dollars that were spent in 1979 . There are indications that 1981 showed similar gains . But there is trouble on the horizon . Reagan , in his drive for a balanced budget , is reducing solar-energy research and demonstration funds . The White House also is studying the idea of asking Congress to repeal tax credits that help cut the high cost of solar equipment . " If tax credits are killed , it would be the demise of small firms like ours , " warns Albert Leary , president of Scientific Solar Installations of Falls Church , Va . Individuals who install solar equipment on their principal residences can take a 40 percent federal income-tax credit on outlays of up to $10,000 , and at least 44 states provide other tax breaks . The Internal Revenue Service reports that 136,000 federal income-tax returns filed for 1980 included 395 million dollars in solar expenditures , up from 61,245 returns filed for 1979 that listed 165.5 million in solar outlays. lnudustry gradually is doing more with solar energy because of an extra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has signed a multimilliondollar contract to supply three large Souther ii textile mills with solar-generated steam over 20 years at prices 10 percent below the cost of oil or gas . To head off any attempt to eliminate tax credits , solar-power advocates have mounted an intensive lobbying effort in Congress . If they are successful , analysts say , solar companies are likely to prospoi when the housing market revives . Water : Back to the Dams Construction of enormous hydroelectric projects is over in the U.S. Most good sites are developed , and those that remain are zealously guarded by environmentalists and property owners . I et hydropower is a booming part of the energy future as cities , public utilities and private companies compete to generate electricity from small dams that have stood unused for decades . A recent Army Corps of Engineers ' study identified about 2,200 existing darns or potential sites across the country that could produce electricity for nearby communities . Most of the small dams ? less than 65 feet high-are on streams or rivers in the Northeast and upper Midwest , where they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hydropower is being fed by an 11 percent tax credit for small-scale water projects , plus the regular 10 percent investment tax credit . Another incentive : The Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 , which requires local utilities to buy electricity produced by small darns at a price up to the cost of electricity generated with conventional fuels . This is being challenged in court . Among projects in the works : Paterson , N.J. , is spending about 9 million dollars to rehabilitate an old hydroelectric plant on the Passaic River . The plant was built in 1912 but was abandoned in the 1960s , when oil was selling for less than $3 a barrel . The 133-year-old Great Stone Dam on the Merrimack River near Lawrence , Mass. , recently began producing power after a group of investors spent 28 million dollars on restoration . When fully operational , the dam is expected to generate enough electricity to meet the needs of 17,000 homes . The normal cost of building a small hydro plant is $1,000 to $2,000 a kilowatt , slightly more than a conventional or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , water provides free " fuel . " Ronald Corso , director of the division of hydropower licensing for the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission , noted that 1,850 preliminary permits were filed in 1981 , three fourths of them for small-scale hydro studies , and that 25 percent may become active projects . Hydropower now accounts for less than 5 percent of the nation 's total energy production . But if all feasible hydropower dams were fully utilized today , said Corso , they " could generate the equivalent of almost 1 million barrels of oil a day ? and that 's 20 percent of current imports . " Wind : Picking Up The idea of harnessing the wind continues to attract interest as the cost of generating electricity from oil , natural gas and nuclear energy keeps soaring . Businesses that use wind power are eligible for a special 15 percent tax break , plus the regular 10 percent investment tax credit . Individuals who install windmills get the 40 percent credit for costs up to $10,000 . Utilities also are required to purchase electricity generated by wind machines . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firm , estimated that about 2,200 wind generators were installed in the U.S. during 1981 ? up from 1,700 in 1980 and about 1,000 in 1979 . Sales , , of wind equipment have grown from 4 million dollars in 1979 to an estimated 26.5 million last year . The Energy Department is building what are believed to be the world 's three largest wind turbines near Yakima , Wash . Each of the huge machines , with 300-foot-long blades , will be capable of producing 2.5 megawatts of power that will be sold to local utilities . The largest private project is being erected by Windfarms , Ltd. , in Solano County , Calif. , near San Francisco . It will include 51 machines with a combined generating capacity of 92 megawatts . Commercial operations are set to begin in 1983 . A second stage will add 95 more machines . The entire complex is expected to produce enough power each year to fill the needs of 150,000 homes and save the equivalent of 1.6 million barrels of oil annually . Cost of the Windfarms complex is estimated at about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conventional power . Advocates claim , however , that mass production of wind machines could cut costs almost in half . Experts say the best sites for wind machines are along the U.S. coastline , in mountainous regions and on the Great Plains , where strong , steady winds blow most of the year .  | Says John Wilson of the Renewable Energy Institute : " Wind may not be the answer to the energy crisis , because there are n't enough sites in this country . But in areas with enough wind , it makes a lot of sense when compared with the cost of oil , gas and nuclear power . " Gasohol : Sputtering Along During the 1979 gasoline shortage , the idea of hitting back at the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries by growing the nation 's own fuel seemed irresistible . President Jimmy Carter announced a crash program ' , aimed at replacing 10 percent of the nation 's gasoline by 1990 with alcohol produced from crops . Congress exempted alcohol-fuel sales from the 4-cent-per-gallon excise tax on gasoline . Lawmakers also approved a special 10 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and created a 3-billion-dollar , 10-year program of loans and loan guarantees to build ethanol plants . Many states , particularly in areas where farmers were struggling with crop surpluses and rising operating costs , cut sales taxes on alcohol fuel , Most of these incentives were aimed at promoting the use of gasohol ? a blenc of 10 percent ethanol , or grain alcoho and 90 percent unleaded gasoline . Today , with the country awash in gasoline , the bloom is off the gasohol boon . Disenchantment extends to Presider . ' Reagan , who has cut all but about 75. million out of the gasohol loan budgets Motorists are shunning gasohol at the pumps , where it usually sells for 3 to 5 cents a gallon more than unleaded gasoline . Texaco , Inc. , the largest marketer of gasohol , announced in October that it was halting gasohol sales in 14 Northeastern states . Amoco and Cities Service Company made a similar retreat . The fuel retains some lingering popularity in farm areas . In Iowa , where gasohol taxes run only 6 cents a gallon . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 30 percent of the unleaded-gasoline market . Instead of promoting gasohol as a gasoline substitute , producers are pushing ethanol as a fuel additive that boostoctane and reduces engine noise . Archer Daniels Midland Company recently opened a distillery at Cedar Rapids . Iowa , with a 40-million-gallon-a-year capacity . Texaco and CPC International have converted an existing wet-milling facility at Pekin , Ill. , to a **34;463;TOOLONG ethanol plant At least 10 other projects are planned . Yet the U.S. produced only an estimated 100 million gallons of ethanol in 1981 ? a tiny amount in comparison with the 2.4 billion gallons of gasoline American motorists burned last year . David E. Hallberg , president of the Renewable Fuels Association , complains : " A lot of uncertainty has set back the timetable for a number of projects . If the government would stop changing the rules of the game , the alcohol-fuels industry would do O.K. " While all renewable fuels account for only a minor share of U.S. energy output , they are making an increasing contribution . Resource &; Technology Management Corporation , a Washington , D.C. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wood and waste ? have absorbed about 22 percent of total growth in the nation 's energy demand from 1975 to 1980 . Notes Charles Hansen , the firms chief executive officer : " This means that alternative energy is actually displacing conventional energy sources at a faster rate than most people realize .
