The concern that this would burden West Germany more than its allies also underlies Bonn ' s urgent pleas to the United States and its Western European neighbors to help formulate a common Western strategy and provide money and political support for advocates of change in Poland and Hungary. // If they fail , Bonn argues , change will never have a chance in East Germany , and rising discontent could prompt a million East Germans to leave for the West as more than 50 , 000 did in the last month. // // Allies Notified // Officials of Chancellor Helmut Kohl ' s Government say that since the new East German leader , Egon Krenz , took over from Erich Honecker last week , they have drawn the attention of the United States , Britain and France , the three Western occupying powers after World War II , to their worries. // " No one really knows what Krenz will do , " Mr. Kohl ' s foreign policy adviser , Horst Teltschik , said in an interview . Mr. Krenz was better known as a Communist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " but we have to give him a chance to surprise us. " // " The demonstrations are continuing , showing that there are still expectations that can ' t be satisfied , " he said . " There could always be a crisis , a violent demonstration with bloody repression . The Western allies have a responsibility if this happens , for Berlin and Germany as a whole . " How Many Is a Strain ? Some West German officials wonder whether the Americans , the British and the French have contingency plans for dealing with a march of angry East Berliners on the crossing points in the Berlin wall . " We estimate that 150 , 000 East Germans will have arrived here this year alone , " Mr. Teltschik said . The new arrivals , mostly young and skilled , are being absorbed into the West German economy and society without great disruption. // " But what happens if 500 , 000 come ? " he asked . " The more things change in East Germany , the more political and economic reform there is , the less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There is only one solution for this problem : fundamental reform in the German Democratic Republic. " // Mr. Teltschik agreed with President Bush ' s statement , made in an interview this week with The New York Times , that he did not fear the idea of German reunification but thought it would take time . " The fear is a united Germany that belongs neither to East nor West , which would lead to an international imbalance , " he said. // " Americans are geographically farther away from the real problems , and so they say , ' Why not ? ' We believe it will take a long time , and that for the immediate future , the only realistic policy is thorough reform in the G.D.R. , " Mr. Teltschik said. // Chancellor Kohl , who faces elections sometime next year and obviously would prefer to not to face the voters and an immigration crisis simultaneously , promised " comprehensive and far-reaching " support for political and economic change in East Germany in a speech to a group of German business leaders on Wednesday . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to improve living conditions in the G.D.R. so that its people will feel at home and wish to remain there. " // The same sort of goal underlay Bonn ' s " Eastern policy " - improving relations with all its Soviet bloc neighbors , which was first carved out in the early 1970 ' s . The neighboring countries have sizable ethnic German minorities , and hundreds of thousands of these people have left for West Germany during the last year . What Sort of Reunification ? Officially , West Germany welcomes them all as Germans . Unofficially , the Government fears " reunification on West German soil , " a fear shared by many in the Social Democratic opposition who see risks as well as benefits in the new East German leadership ' s promise to grant its citizens freedom to travel to the West. // Egon Bahr , a Social Democratic member of Parliament and one of the architects of the " Eastern policy , " said : " There are estimates that between 1. 2 and 1. 4 million East Germans have made applications for exit visas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be very difficult . The G.D.R. has to create a situation in which people want to stay , but that will only happen if there ' s freedom of speech and the media , a prospect of raising the standard of living , and the freedom to travel as well. " // The Government and the opposition in Bonn agree that a joint Western strategy to deal with change in all of Eastern Europe is urgently needed , and that Western offers of aid to Poland and Hungary so far have been insufficient. // Mr. Kohl will go to Warsaw on Nov. 9 with a package of aid and Government investment-credit guarantees worth more than $1 billion . His Government will pledge about the same amount as President Bush promised , $200 million , toward a $1-billion currency stabilization credit that Poland wants to help bring its inflation under control , and it supports Poland ' s request for a moratorium of at least three years on payments on its $39 billion foreign debt , Mr. Teltschik said. // Polish officials and experts have been scurrying all over Western Europe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to help them succeed , but they also make it evident that they are not altogether sure how to do it. // Britain has promised $40 million each , over five years , to Poland and Hungary to help train the managers , investment bankers , economists and joint-venture experts it needs , and Mr. Teltschik suggested an international institute in Warsaw , with experts to tell the Poles " not what to do , but how to do it. " // " All these bilateral measures have to be coordinated , or they will just dissipate , " he said , " and they should not be limited in scope . Besides Poland and Hungary today , the G.D.R. could join tomorrow , or Czechoslovakia , or Bulgaria . One country alone can not satisfy all of Eastern Europe ' s needs , even if it wanted to. " // But he also conceded that Bonn has some items on its own agenda . Among the agreements Mr. Kohl will sign in Poland when he visits next month is an accord establishing the rights of the ethnic German minority there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Germans hope might make it more attractive for such people to stay in Poland rather than come to West Germany and compete for jobs and scarce housing. //
