Fewer than 300 of the 56,000 commercial airline pilots in the U.S. are women . In that select group , Claudia Jones , 35 ( left ) , and Cathy Jones , 25 , have still another distinction : they are stepmother and daughter . Florida-raised Claudia began as an entertainer ( she plays 19 instruments and sings ) , then learned to fly so she could barnstorm with her Vegas act . Claudia started putting in time as a flight instructor , and during one stint Cathy turned up as a student . That led to Claudia 's marrying Cathy 's father , Hal Jones . Now Claudia co-pilots Boeing 727s for Continental Airlines , while Cathy , though a licensed pilot , works as a flight engineer with Western Airlines . Last year 's proposed merger between the two airlines might have brought the two women closer together ; as it is , the Joneses have trouble keeping up with each other . Says Claudia : " We always seem to be going in different directions . "         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
