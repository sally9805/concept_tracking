 | Every noble pursuit ? romance , the gaining of wisdom , raising a family , bowling ? requires dedication above all . So let 's try a simple test . Consider Jonathan Scott and Lyle Nelsen , both of Chicago . Scott , 32 , produces " rock-star bowling events " that actually take place in nightclubs . He describes bowling as " almost like a tres chic thing . " Nelsen , 65 , bowls every Tuesday night in a league sponsored by his union and is in his fifth decade as a kegler . He once checked out of the hospital on a Friday morning after a gall-bladder operation and went bowling that night . Question : which of these men is truly dedicated to bowling ? It is n't that we mean to pick on Yuppies , although now that we think about it we kind of like the idea . But there is a battle taking shape in the lanes and alleys of America . What 's at stake is not survival ? the industry is in good shape , with both more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 8,000 ) than there were 20 years ago . What 's at stake is the soul of bowling , an ancient game that proceeds in a straight historical line from Fred Flintstone through Ralph Kramden to the present day . The opposing sides may loosely be termed the Scotts and the Nelsens . Anybody who cares about the game will finally have to choose : which side are you on ? Capri pants : The central issue can be summed up in one word : image . Bowling tends to call up a specific set of pictures in the American mind ? of dark , smoky alleys ; guys with D.A . ' s swilling Pabst from longnecks ; women in capri pants teetering toward the foul line on spike heels . These images are largely the product of the urban bowling alleys that flourished in the ' 50s and ' 60s . But in the ' 80s , an era of soaring real-estate prices and high liability premiums , urban alleys are in trouble . Spencer 's Marina City Bowl on the Chicago River is the only alley left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Angeles has lost four bowling centers to development in the last few years . In New York at least seven alleys have closed in the last five years . " There used to be a bowling alley every subway stop , " sighs Bill Nye , day manager of the 10-alley Beacon Lanes on Amsterdam Avenue . Now the Beacon is one of just four alleys left in Manhattan . And so , as bowling rolls into the ' 90s , it is changing forever . The industry sees this as the time to reinvent the bowling alley ? which it now prefers to call a lane ? in an attempt to go after younger , more affluent bowlers . " The old-style , cigar-chomping , beer-drinking alleys are rapidly becoming a thing of the past , " says Mark Spiegel , chief executive officer of the 27-center Active West chain in California . The future will look more like Active West 's new South Bay Bowl in Redondo Beach ? a brightly lit , high-ceilinged " family environment " that includes an ice-cream parlor and Persian restaurant . Or the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contains a video arcade , a billiard room , beauty and barber shops and an insurance broker . There are " lock-in parties " at lanes in Houston and Ft . Worth , where teenagers bowl all night for a free breakfast in the morning , and weekend rock-and-roll parties at Bowlmor in New York 's Greenwich Village . Lakeside Bowl in suburban Chicago features a comedy club on Saturday nights . A more centralized effort at image manipulation is coming out of the National Bowling Council , an industry marketing group . A 16-page booklet published by the council last spring describes the bowling public in staggering demographic detail : bowlers are better educated than the national average , earn more money , have more children , own their homes more often . The message for prospective advertisers : " Bowlers are the great American mar- ket . " The push did n't end there . Last year the council signed Mary Lou Retton to a four-year contract as a pitchperson for the game . The ex-Olympian anchored a $3.5 million " Superbowlin ' Saturday " campaign that the council @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appears for the council at annual industry conventions . She also shows up on page 9 of the National Bowling Council booklet , grinning and clutching a bowling ball that is bigger than her head . Why Mary Lou ? " We wanted someone who could reach folks who had n't done much bowling , " says council vice president Joe Schoenberg . " Mary Lou can do that . " Yeah , but can she bowl ? " She has a respectable average for someone her age and stature , given the amount of time she puts into it , " Schoenberg says . ( Her average : 135 . ) The council sees its image-shaping culminating in 1988 , when bowling makes its debut as an exhibition sport at the Olympics . Add all this up , says managing editor Jim Dressel of Bowling Magazine , and what you have is " the great search for the Yuppie consumer . " Clashing sound : And this is precisely the problem . Active West 's Spiegel brings it into sharper focus , albeit inadvertently : " People who have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been into tennis or gold or heavy vacations , are now thinking about bowling . " Forget for a moment the awful clashing sound made by the phrase " discretionary recreation dollars , " and think about this : Yuppies are fickle . They 'll seize on bowling for a time , seeing in it some kind of ironic retro-thrill . But they 'll never really get it . They wo n't grasp the pure sonic pleasure of crashing tenpins , or smell the sweetness in stale beer and cigar smoke , or savor the glare of neon or the solid thwock of a real steel pinball against a wooden bumper off in the cocktail lounge . And when the game pales , just as tennis and gold and heavy vacations paled , these fairweather bowlers will move on . And what will be left behind for the rest of us to bowl in ? We 'll tell you what will be left : clean , bright alleys the size of airplane hangars , with rose-scented humidified air and spring water on tap and foam-rubber pins that do n't make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bowl in a place like that ? Turn back . There 's still time . Let bowling be bowling .
