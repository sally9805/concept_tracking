But , along with thousands of others who are buying or refinancing their homes these days , Mr. Hackett is caught in a severe traffic jam at the lender ' s window . Still waiting for his loan to be processed , his " apprehension level is rising , " he said . Since mortgage rates turned up shortly after he sought his new mortgage , Mr. Hackett said , " I ' m on the phone with my mortgage company every other day. " // The problem stems from the huge volume of loan applications stimulated by the sharp and sudden drop in interest rates this year to a more affordable level . It has flooded banks , mortgage companies , credit unions and other lenders - and has stalled the commitment and closing process . <> <> Rates Moving Up Again // This slowdown is already costly to borrowers as they see rates rising again . According to the Federal National Mortgage Association , the average mortgage rate on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages now stands at 10. 475 percent . That rate compares with 10. 095 percent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 634 percent in May 1985. // Thus , individuals , such as Mr. Hackett , who may have fixed an interest rate of about 9. 5 percent in April with a 60-day lock-in could have only one more day to assure that level before a higher rate would go into effect . And when the timing of one mortgage closing is delayed , others down the line may be equally delayed as home sellers are prevented from buying another property on which they are waiting to close. // " You ' re just dealing with a system that ' s taxed , " said Peter Knight , vice president of the National Council of Savings Institutions . " Some lenders say they ' re not going to take certain types of business. " // Other lenders have even been forced to schedule appointments with borrowers weeks in advance . In some cases , application and reservation fees are also being raised as a tool to stem the flow of new loan applications. // Adding to the backlog was the suspension for several weeks this month of the Federal Housing Administration ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of home mortgages . The F.H.A. ' s credit limit in the area is expected to be reached at the end of July . This means that the agency will not be able to accept any more applications for mortgage backing unless Congress raises its debt ceiling . <> <> ' Biggest Year ' Seen // " We used to see a processing time of four to six weeks , " said Charles A. Breinig , mortgage analyst for the Mortgage Reporting Service of Jenkintown , Pa . " Now we ' re seeing anywhere from eight to ten weeks . This will probably be the biggest year in history in terms of the number of loans processed by lending institutions. " // Estimates by the Federal National Mortgage Association support Mr. Breinig ' s view . The agency predicts that a huge $300 billion in mortgages for one- to four-family homes will be financed or refinanced in 1986 , compared with $246 billion last year. // " It ' s comparable to a back-office crisis in the stock brokerage business , " said Ted Robertson , a real estate broker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ L.I. " There is a tremendous pent-up demand and there is no set of rules. " // The mortgage crush at financial institutions has been exacerbated by two parallel developments : a rash of refinancing due to lower mortgage rates - the lowest in eight years - and a resurgent real estate market during the prime home buying season . Refinancings alone - expected to total $150 billion for two million units in 1986 - represent almost half of the business now being done by mortgage bankers , companies that originate mortgage loans . Thus lenders are being bombarded with many more requests for mortgage loans than can be handled expeditiously . <> <> Many Are ' Shopping ' // " One of the problems in this thing is that an awful lot of people who want to refinance are shopping , " said Robert Chaut , vice president of Salomon Brothers . " So they will file papers at three or four institutions and wait and see who comes in first and who comes in cheapest. " // The biggest bottleneck , according to lenders and economists , is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They say that appraisers , either independent companies or the lending institution , can not keep up with the demand. // " We are inundated with applications for financings and refinancings , " said Stuart Reis , senior product manager for Chemical Bank . " And we just can ' t get the appraisals done fast enough. " // " It really gets backed up at the real estate appraisal end , " added Mark Obrinsky , economist for the United States League of Savings Institutions . " You can hire new people for other processing , but this is the one kind of job you can ' t train someone quickly for . Real estate appraisers are working overtime and still getting longer queues behind them . " <> <> Other Delays // Appraisals , however , are not the only slow part of the process . Other problems are reported at credit bureaus , title companies and lawyers ' offices , creating major delays for lenders in all parts of the country. // Still another element adding to the mortgage backlog is the increasing number of loans being made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of retaining their loans , most lenders now pool them for sale to investors in the secondary market through such agencies as the Government National Mortgage Association and the Federal National Mortgage Association . And those agencies require additional clearances and more paperwork before granting approval. // " The secondary market makes it possible for banks to make fixed-rate loans in this environment , " said Howard Culang , vice president of Citibank . " And that ' s a spur to lending. " // The excessive delays are not only frustrating to buyers and sellers , but also expensive for buyers when mortgage rates move upward , as they have recently . Depending on the lender , the interest rate can be set at the time of application , commitment or closing , but it is usually guaranteed , or locked in , only for a fixed period of 45 to 90 days. // " When rates are going up , you ' ll want to lock in at application , " said Paul Havemann , vice president of HSH Associates of Riverdale , N.J. , which surveys the offerings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ' ll want to lock in at commitment or closing . But it ' s usually up to the lender . " <> <> Cautious on Commitments // But " because of current experience , almost no lender is committing at the time of application , " said Warren Lasko , executive vice president of the Mortgage Bankers Association of America . " They ' re doing ' floaters ' and setting the rate just before the closing. " // As the backlog of unprocessed mortgages grows , a ripple effect takes place , since sellers are often unable to acquire new homes until their old homes are sold . And in cases where a seller must proceed with a new purchase , he or she may be forced to carry a particularly heavy financial burden. // That is the situation with the house that Mr. Hackett has contracted to purchase . " The person we ' re buying the house from had to take a bridge loan for his new house , " he said . " He ' s going to be paying two mortgages. " //  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
