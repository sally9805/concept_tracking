txt VERY QUIETLY , without even ' a written announcement , Betsy Rosenfield has opened a handsome gallery .. It is on the first floor of the building at 226 E. Ontario St. , in the space most recently occupied by the Vorpal gallery . Those who visited Vorpal may remember its laid-back ? California ambience , complete with the requisite bad taste . Rosenfield has gotten rid of everything , right down to the shag carpet , And the 1,600-square-foot space ? designed by Jon Cockrell ? is elegantly streamlined , ? yet filled with character . This is rather new to Chicago : With few exceptions , galleries here are small white boxes or sprawling , not always finished lofts . Rosenfield avoids the conventional coldness of white walls , but nonetheless maintains a thoroughly businesslike setting . It is the kind of look one would expect to find more often in Europe . The gallery 's coMmitment is unusual , too . Without being strictly devoted to clay or glass , it will present such works on a regular basis , along with paintings , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ? ay she will be exhibiting modern , rather than only contemp nary , art , making the entire century a possible ran . , a . The only thing she wants to avoid is the idea of Cr ! . ts . IIER DIVERSE appreciation Is partly attributable to the remarkable collection of her parents , Ed and Lindy Bergman , an influence of which Rosenfield is justifably ? proud . But her taste is her own , developed while work- , ing at the Museum of Contemporary Art . Rosenfield 's last position there was director of development , and one hears the voice of a businesswoman when she speaks of gallery efficiency , , plans for advertising , and a computerized inventory . Running a gallery might have been a dream since childhood ; but now that it has become a reality this director does not leave one in doubt of her serious approach . On the artistic side , the current group ? exhibition of 27. works by 13 ' artists serves to ' introduce some of those iyho will have one-person shows in the pear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remarkable ceramic sculidor whose pieces occasionally were seen at the Allan Fruity-kin Gallery ( Sept. ** 7 ) ; Chicago 's Don Baum , who has n't exhihitdd in nvir'e than a decade ( Oct. 10-Nov. 11 ) ; Joseph Piccillo , a consummate draftsman from New York ( Nov. ** 16 ) ; and Ken Price , whose third and largest " death shrine " will close the year ( Dec. ** 26 ) . AMONG THE ) OTHERS now on view are Doug Baldwin , a ceramicist . as playful as David Gilhooly ; Rosamond Berg , . whose rows ' of dyed cotton sacks surprisingly have never been shown here before ; the contemporary master of glass , Dale Chihuly ; one of the painters who reopened the MCA last year , Richaryll Jackson ; and a ceramic sculptor of extraordinary delicacy , John Roloff . Summer hours are 10 a.m. to 5:30 p.m . Monday through Friday . One should not hesitate to go . ? The Hyde Park Art Center , 5236 S. Blackstone Av. , is facing a problem that has recurred with disheartening regularity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to move . Neither the occurrence nor the circumstances are new : demolitions and high rents have forced no fewer than eight relocations . But the present address has been home since 1961 , and many of the exhibitions that helped shape Chick ? art took place there . The space has been leased from the Hyde Park YMCA , which is around the corner , on 53d Street . This fall the ' YMCA 's main building will be closed and may be torn down . Its offices will take over the gallery Oct. 1 , but some of the classes from the center 's school apparently will stay . The center is negotiating for a move . to the old Del Prado Hotel , on the southeast corner of Hyde Park Boulevard and 53d Street , which is being converted to an apartment building . The . gallery would occupy a former ballroom and cocktail lounge . According to Jane Pugh , treasurer of the center , " Nothing has been resolved yet , but if we take over the space , it will require renovation . At our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and $40,000. but that was quite a while ago . It probably will be higher . ' Whatever the cost , we will , have to raise all the money . " IT LOOKS AS IF the current Emil Armin retrnspretive , " which runs through Aug. 24 , will be the last show on Blackstone Avenue . A Don Baum retrospective was scheduled to open Oct. 5 , and center coordinator Robert Hutchison reported that a temporary space might be located and the show 's dates maintained . If not , the exhibition will inaugurate the new permanent gallery . Four years ago , Goldene Shaw wrote : " How the center . .. survived not only wars but the tearing down and redevelopment of an entire community is testimony to the foresight of its founders and a legacy to those who have followed them . " The comment seems narticularlv appropriate now .
