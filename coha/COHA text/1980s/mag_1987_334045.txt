When Viktor Berkhin , a reporter for the monthly magazine Soviet Miner , was arrested last July on charges of " hooliganism , " cries of foul came from an unlikely Big Brother . None other than the mighty Pravda , the official Communist Party newspaper , rushed to Berkhin 's defense with two articles setting out the details of his arrest , 14-day detention and the police search of his apartment . Pravda charged that Berkhin 's only crime was that he had done his job too well , riling local authorities by exposing government corruption in a coal-mining region of the Ukraine . The paper concluded that the secret police had committed " gross violations of socialist legality " in their treatment of Berkhin . <P> Last week the case came to a startling and unprecedented conclusion . The KGB official who had engineered Berkhin 's arrest was fired , and there were warnings that more dismissals were in the offing . Even more surprising was the way the firing was announced : on the front page of Pravda . In a statement signed by KGB @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a discredit to his profession . Chebrikov pledged to take measures to " ensure the strict observance of law " by state security forces . <P> Both the admission of misconduct and the public disclosure of punitive action against a ranking KGB officer were virtually unheard-of events . They seemed to indicate that even the elite secret police will not be immune to Mikhail Gorbachev 's calls for glasnost , a program of openness aimed at exposing shortcomings and abuses of power in Soviet life . Some analysts speculate that the Kremlin is determined to bring the KGB under control . It will undoubtedly take time , and more disciplinary actions , before KGB agents lose their enthusiasm for trampling on the civil rights of Soviet citizens . But the incident is certain to encourage Soviet journalists to write more frankly about their country 's problems .
