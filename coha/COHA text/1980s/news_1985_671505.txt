Now through the Labor Day weekend is the time to " get the big shot treatment while the big shots are out of town , " according to Charles Gillett , president of the New York Convention and Visitors Bureau . If you ever wanted to go to a clublike restaurant such as Elaine ' s , Mr. Gillett suggests this may be the week to do it , " because her regular customers are out in the Hamptons. " // Although a few of the city ' s most popular restaurants , such as Lutece , Arcadia and Positano , are closed for the holiday , the bustling eating places such as Petaluma , Amsterdam ' s , El Coyote , Victor ' s Cafe 52 , Canastel ' s and America are not , and diners who are showing up without reservations this week are finding they can be seated either immediately or with just a few minutes wait . In a restaurant like Elio ' s , which seats only by reservation and where bookings days in advance are not unusual , " reservations are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owner. // Have you been hankering to try the chicken fried steak and mashed potatoes at How ' s Bayou in TriBeCa ? Usually in the evenings , the crowds are spilling out through the wrought iron doors of this no-reservations restaurant onto Greenwich Street . A 45-minute wait at the bar is not unusual . " But this is a slow week for us , " said Tom Montera , the manager . It is slow also at Victor ' s Cafe 52 a traditional Cuban restaurant where the likes of Roberto Duran and Jose Iglesias are regulars , a fine place for some cold gazpacho on a muggy evening. // At the Quilted Giraffe , the staff has taken early vacations so as to be open this slower week . At Indochine , Mezzaluna , the American Festival and Uzie ' s , where even reservations are usually difficult , seats can be had for the calling . Indochine ' s owners had intended to close the restaurant late in August , according to Michael Callahan , its manager , " but business was good , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nonetheless , a seat in a green banquette among the rubber plants of the Lafayette Street restaurant is not as difficult a ticket as it will be after Labor Day. // Aldo Bozzi , co-owner of Mezzaluna , one of the East Side ' s growing number of Italian restaurants , said : " We are crowded , but less crowded than we are usually , less crowded than we will be . After Labor Day we will be back to our mad level. " // Evenings are a bit slower , too , this week at America and Petaluma , where waiting is an accepted part of dining . Most nights there are mob scenes at both places , with America ' s prospective patrons seemingly happy just to stand behind the sidewalk ropes in hopes of getting inside within an hour , and with Petaluma ' s customers waiting interminably for a chance at its boutique pizzas . But for these few days at least , " The wait is only a few minutes , " said Vincent Pascal , the manager of America. // Jim Claras , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s Upper East Side apartment , was sipping a drink at the bar at Petaluma earlier this week . " I ' m having an easy time getting into all the places my daughter says are so crowded , " he said , " places like this . " Mr. Claras said he had managed to drink margaritas without being jostled at Juanita ' s and to have dinner , without a wait , at Odeon. // A table at a popular restaurant isn ' t the only thing easier to come by right now . A woman calling one of the Bergdorf Goodman hair salons late one recent afternoon was surprised to be able to get an appointment - for herself and for a friend - the next day . Leslie Waller of the Elizabeth Arden on Fifth Avenue said that there , too , business has been slower and last-minute appointments easier to get . " Normally we ' re just not able to offer such service , " she said. // There is also more room to maneuver through the aisles of the big department stores such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s and B. Altman , even though there are end-of-summer sale items available and back-to-school necessities to buy . It is even easier to make reservations at Bloomingdale ' s dining car restaurant , Le Train Bleu , these days. // Jack MacBean , who likes to shop at Tiffany , says that on most visits to the store he expects to stand in line at the upper-floor gift department . But when he walked in the other day , he said , " Three people came up and asked if they could help me . " Another pleasantly surprised shopper walked into Altman ' s food department at noon several days ago and found herself the only customer. // It is a fine week for recreational sports in the city as well . The swimming pool lanes at the New York Health and Racquet Club on East 45th Street are " unbelievably empty , " according to Brian Herzer , the manager . Similarly , the Parc Swim and Health Club in midtown , is " much less crowded than usual , " according to a spokesman . Several tennis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of American Theaters and Producers says tickets for just about all of Broadway ' s shows , even tickets for hits like " Biloxi Blues , " " 42d Street , " " Cats " and " Sunday in the Park With George , " are available , and will remain so through the Labor Day weekend and even for a brief time thereafter. // " It is a historical pattern that after holiday weekends business falls off slightly , " said George Wachtel , the league ' s director of research . And TKTS in Times Square will be selling half-price tickets to every show currently on Broadway every day this week from 3 to 8 P.M. , additionally on matinee days from noon until 2 P.M. and on Sunday from noon until theater box offices close. // The other day , Ruth Fenton and Natalie Feingold , buyers for their dress and accessories shop in Coral Gables , Fla. , walked up to the box office of the Neil Simon Theater on West 52d Street and bought two tickets for " Biloxi Blues . " " It is easier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " Usually everybody ' s rude and the service is not so good. " // " You can walk around , " Miss Feingold added , " without everybody hitting your elbows.
