Edwin Landseer , seen afresh , had wallop with the pathos <P> Twenty-five years ago , everyone knew Sir Edwin Landseer was as dead as a shot stag-dispatched , as it were , by the bullets of postimpressionism and " significant form . " Even ten years ago , the idea that a major museum might commit itself to a resurrection of his work would have seemed , if not absurd , at least improbable . Realist revivals were one thing-but Landseer ? Yet here he is , in an exhibit that opened last month at the Philadelphia Museum of Art and will go on to London 's Tate Gallery in early 1982 . And he has been restored with great care , at much expense , in all his Victorian gloss and tearjerking bluffness . One hears again the squalling pibroch and the coarse jests of whisky millionaires tramping the heather . In this microcosm of gillies and grouse feathers , one is made to see as much moral pathos licked into the pink eye of a rabbit as is pulled by most other Victorian painters from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to put it mildly , quite an experience . <P> When Landseer died , mad and alcoholic , in 1873 , people closed their shops and waited on the London pavements for his cortege to pass by . Flags went to half-staff , and mourning wreaths were placed in the mouths of the four bronze lions which , a few years before , he had sculpted for the base of Nelson 's Column in Trafalgar Square . He was buried in St. Paul 's , and his monument bears a stone copy of one of his best-known paintings , an image recognizable to thousands of people who probably could not have identified a Turner , a Blake or even a Constable : The Old Shepherd 's Chief Mourner , a grief-stricken collie resting its head on its master 's coffin . <P> Artists had drawn animals , of course , since the bisons of Lascaux . But Landseer was the only painter who ever became a court favorite and a national culture hero by painting dogs . He painted other creatures too-ptarmigans and parrots , monkeys , cats , horses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a time when no cottage parlor or country hall lacked its framed print of Landseer 's defiant twelve-point stag , The Monarch of the Glen . <P> He also painted people , and his fussy , glass-smooth portraits of his royal patrons , Queen Victoria and Prince Albert , are among the most obsequious images of British royalty ever done by a court artist . <P> <P> But the dogs made him . Sometimes they were royal dogs , like Victoria 's spaniel Dash , or Albert 's black greyhound Eos . Sometimes they were proletarian lurchers and terriers . Almost always , however , they were moralized . The " pathetic fallacy , " the somewhat tiresome habit of affixing human feelings and traits to animals or plants , reached its height in Victorian England . It was Landseer 's use of it , along with his extraordinarily realistic observation of fur , fin and feather , that made him a demigod of popular culture . <P>
