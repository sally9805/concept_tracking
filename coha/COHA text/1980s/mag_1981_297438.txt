The White House sends a Saudi deal to a surly Congress <P> There was no compromise . The Senate had fervently hoped for some modification of the Administration 's plan to sell five Airborne Warning and Control System ( AWACS ) jets to Saudi Arabia , some face-saving deal that would give the U.S. more control over use of the sophisticated radar planes . Yet Ronald Reagan decided last week to place his presidential power and prestige behind a proposal that most members had already declared unacceptable . " I have proposed this sale because it significantly enhances our own vital national security interests in the Middle East , " he said at a news conference a few hours after officially submitting the agreement to Congress. * The head-on battle he thus opened will be the first major congressional test of his foreign policy . <P> Reagan argued that the AWACS sale , one of several topics he touched on at the news conference ( see following story ) , was needed to keep Saudi oilfields safe , and that the planes posed no threat to the security @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the security and stability of the region , it serves Israel 's long-range interests . " <P> The President also broached a sensitive issue : " It is not the business of other nations to make American foreign policy , " he said . The nation he meant was Israel , and it was Reagan 's strongest attack yet on the lobby that has been highly effective thus far on Israel 's behalf in encouraging opposition to the sale . The American Israel Public Affairs Committee , the organization leading that effort , has been presenting a detailed case against the sale to Senators and Congressmen for the past five months . The lobbying also has a strong grass-roots component , with Jewish leaders in each state who agree with the lobby 's aim being asked to contact their Congressmen . For their part , the Saudis have hired a high-priced Washington consultant , Frederick Dutton , but efforts on their behalf have generally been quieter . Says Dutton : " The Saudis take the position that this is a battle for the Administration to fight , not them . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plastered all over town that say REAGAN OR BEGIN . " <P> From the beginning , the Administration has mishandled its own AWACS lobbying effort . Secretary of State Alexander Haig , who recognized that the sale might be doomed , suggested to the White House that National Security Adviser Richard Allen be put in charge of it . The recommendation , some insiders claim , was a clever way to cripple further one of Haig 's rivals by sloughing off on him a thankless task . In fact , Haig had facetiously suggested that Vice President George Bush , another sometime adversary , might be the best man to take charge of selling the sale . <P> Some sympathetic White House aides say that Allen , who reports to the President mainly through Counsellor Edwin Meese , is now being unfairly cast as a scapegoat . Most insiders , however , feel that he has managed to make a difficult situation worse by his inept efforts on the Hill . " He had neither the clout nor the brains to pull it off , " said one Senate aide . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
