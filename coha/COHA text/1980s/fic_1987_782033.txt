You 'd better believe it . " The camera panned to show the massive crowds gathered on Pennsylvania Avenue , huddled inside their overcoats against the bitter January wind , listening to the ceremony on loudspeakers set up around the podium . Jason Merlin , Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court , finished the swearing-in oath , and the new President shook his hand and stepped up to the microphone .

My definition of a liberal is a man who has his ass thinly stuck in clouds of cotton wool . " The truth was that Ben Cohn was not as cynical as he sounded . Ile had covered Paul Ellison 's career from the beginning , and while it was true that he had not been impressed at first , as Ellison moved up the political ladder Ben ( ' ohn began to change his opinion .

I speak today not only to our allies , but to those countries in the Soviet camp . I say to them now , as we prepare to move into the twenty-first century , that there is no longer any room for confrontation and that we must learn to make the phrase one world become a reality .

In Junction City , Kansas , it was a potbellied stove kind of day , bleak and raw , and snowing so hard that the visibility on Highway 6 was almost zero . Mary Ashley cautiously steered her old station wagon toward the center of the highway , where the snowplows had been at work . The storm was going to make her late for the class she was teaching . She drove slowly , careful not to let the car go into u skid . From the car radio came the President 's voice : " . . . are many in government as well as in private life who insist that America build more moats instead of bridges .

He was in bed , naked , sandwiched between the Dolly sisters . Lantz had empirical evidence that they were not truly sisters . Annette was a tall natural brunette , and Sally was a tall natural blonde . Not that Harry Lantz gave a damn whether they were blood relatives . What was important was that they were both expert at what they did , and what they were doing made Lantz groan aloud with pleasure . At the tar end of the motel room , the image of the President flickered on the television set .

I want to inform you now that we have approached the government of Romania and its President , Alexandros Ionescu , and he has agreed to reestablish diplomatic relations with our country .

" I 've already been circumcised ! What the fuck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you move for , hon ? " Lantz did not hear her . His eyes were glued to the television set . " One of our first official acts , " the President was saying , " will be to send an ambassador to Romania . And that is merely the beginning . .  | In Bucharest , it was evening . The winter weather had turned unexpectedly mild and the streets of the late marketplaces were crowded with citizens lined up to shop in the unseasonably warm weather . Romanian President Alexandros lonescu sat in his office in Peles , the old palace , on Calea Victoriei , surrounded by half a dozen aides , listening to the broadcast on a shortwave radio . " . . . I have no intention of stopping there , " the American President was saying . " Albania broke off all diplomatic relations with the United States in 1946 . I intend to reestablish those ties .

The day you were nominated for the pt csidency , I was as jealous as hell , Paul . It was my dream , and you were living it . But do you know something ? I finally came to realize that if I could n't sit in that chair , there was no one else in the world I would want to sit there but you . ' I hat chair suits you .

" Yes , Mr. President ? " Paul Ellison turned to Rogers . " Coffee ? " " Sounds good . " " Want anything with it ? " " No , thanks . Barbara wants me to watch my waistline . " The President nodded to Henry , the steward , and he quietly left the room . Barbara . She had surprised everyone . The gossip around Washington was that the marriage would not last out the first year . But it had been almost fifteen years now , and it was a success . Stanton Rogers had built up a prestigious law practice in Washington , and Barbara had earned the reputation of being a gracious hostess . Paul Ellison rose and began to pace .

" " It 's not going to fail . " He leaned back in his chair . " Do you know the biggest problem with the world today ? There are no more statesmen . Countries are being run by politicians .

" Stanton Rogers took a sip of his coffee and rose to his feet . " I 'll get State on it right away . " In the little suburb of Neuilly , it was two A.M. Marin Groxa 's villa lay in ebon darkness , the moon nested in a thick layer of storm clouds . The streets were hushed at this hour , with only the sound of an occasional passerby rippling the silence . A black-clad figure moved noiselessly through the trees toward the brick wall that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rope and a blanket , and in his arms was cradled an Uzi with a silencer and a dart gun . When he reached the wall , he stopped and listened . He waited , motionless , for five minutes . Finally , satisfied , he uncoiled the nylon rope and tossed the scaling hook attached to the end of it upward until it caught on the far edge of the wall . Swiftly , the man began to climb . When he reached the top of the H all , he flung the blanket across it to protect himself against the poison-tipped metal spikes embedded on top . He stopped again to listen . He reversed the hook , shifting the rope to the inside of the wall , and slid down onto the grounds . He t flecked the halisong at his waist , the deadly Filipino folding  | knife that could be flicked open or closed with one hand . The , rit , t k dogs would be next . " Me intruder crouched there , waiting for them to pick tip his scent . There were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only the first obstacle . The grounds and the villa were filled with electronic devices , and continuously monitored by television cameras . All mail and packages were received at the gatehouse and opened there by the guards . The doors of the villa were bombproof . The villa had its own water supply , and Marin Groza had a food taster . The villa was impregnable . Supposedly . The figure in black was here this night to prove that it was not . He heard the sounds of the dogs rushing at him before he saw them . They came flying out of the darkness , charging at his throat . " There were two of them . He aimed the dart gun and shot the nearest one on his left first , and then the one on his right , dodging out of the way of their hurtling bodies . He spun around , alert for the third dog , and when it came , he fired again , and then there was only stillness . The intruder knew where the sonic traps were buried in the ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the areas of the grounds that the television cameras did not cover , and in less than two minutes after he had gone over the wall , he was at the hack door of the villa . As he reached for the handle of the door , he was caught in the sudden glare of floodlights . A voice called out , " Freeze ! Drop your gun and raise your hands . " The figure in black carefully dropped his gun and looked up . There were half a dozen men spread out on the roof , with a variety of weapons pointed at him . The man in black growled , " What the fuck took you so long ? I never should have gotten this far . " " You did n't , " the head guard informed him . " We started tracking you before you got over the wall . " Lev Pasternak was not mollified . " Then you should have stopped me sooner . I could have been on a suicide mission with a load of grenades or a goddamn mortar . I want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , eight o'clock sharp . The dogs have been stunned . Have someone keep an eye on them until they wake up . " Lev Pasternak prided himself on being the best security guard in the world . He had been a pilot in the Israeli SixDay War , and after the war had become a top agent in Mossad , one of Israel 's five secret services . He would never forget the morning , two years earlier , when his colonel had called him into his office . " Lev , someone wants to borrow you for a few weeks . " " I hope it 's a blonde , " Lev quipped . " It 's Marin Groza . " Mossad had a complete file on the Romanian dissident . Groza had been the leader of a popular Romanian movement to depose Alexandros Ionescu and was about to stage a coup when he was betrayed by one of his men . More than two dozen underground fighters had been executed , and Groza had barely escaped the country with his life . France had given him sanctuary . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and put a price on his head . So far half a dozen attempts to assassinate Groza had failed , but he had been wounded in the latest attack . " What does he want with me ? " Pasternak asked . " He has government protection . " Not good enough . He needs someone to set up a foolproof security system . He came to us . I recommended you . " " I 'd have to go to France ? " " It will only take you a few weeks . " " I do n't ? " " I . ev , we 're talking about a mensch . He 's the guy in the %bite hat . Our information is that he has enough popular rrpport in his home country to knock over Ionescu . When the timing is right , he 'll make his move . Meanwhile , we have to keep the man alive . " I . cv Pasternak thought about it . " A few weeks , you said ? " " " That 's all . "  | The olonel had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ r ight about Marin Groza . He was a thin , fragile-looking man with an ascetic air about him and a face etched with sorrow . He had an aquiline nose , a firm chin , and a broad forehead , topped by a spray of white hair . He had deep black eyes , and when he spoke , they blazed with passion . " I do n't give a damn whether I live or die , " he told Lev at their first meeting . " We 're all going to die . It 's the when that I 'm concerned about . I have to stay alive for another year or two . " That 's all the time I need to drive Ionescu out of my country . " He ran his hand absently across a livid scar on his cheek . " No man has the right to enslave a country . We have to free Romania and let the people decide their own fate . " Lev Pasternak went to work on the security system at the villa in Neuilly . He used some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ checked out thoroughly . Every single piece of equipment was state of the art . Pasternak saw the Romanian rebel leader every day , and the more time he spent with him , the more he came to admire him . When Marin Groza asked Pasternak to stay on as his security chief , Pasternak did not hesitate . " I 'll do it , " he said , " until you 're ready to make your move . Then I will return to Israel . " They struck a deal . At irregular intervals , Pasternak staged surprise attacks on the villa , testing its security . Now , he thought : Some of the guards are getting careless . I 'll have to replace them . He walked through the hallways , carefully checking the heat sensors , the electronic warning systems , and the infrared beams at the sill of each door . As he reached Marin Groza 's bedroom , he heard a loud crash , and a moment later Groza began screaming out in agony . Lev Pasternak passed Groza 's room and kept walking . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Potomac River in Langley , Virginia , seven miles northwest of Washington , D.C. At the approach road lo the agency is a flashing red beacon on top of a gate . The gatehouse is guarded twenty-four hours a day , and authorized visitors are issued colored badges giving them access only to the particular department with which they have business . Outside the gray seven-level headquarters building , himsically called the Toy Factory , is a large statue of Nathan Hale . Inside , on the ground floor , a glass corridor wall laces an inner courtyard with a landscaped garden dotted oh magnolia trees .

Seated around the large oak table were Ned Tillingast , director of the CIA ; General Oliver Brooks , Army Chief of Staff ; Secretary of State Floyd Baker ; Pete Connors , chief of counterintelligence ; and Stanton Rogers . Ned Tillingast , the CIA director , was in his sixties , a cold , taciturn man , burdened with maleficent secrets . There is a light branch and a dark branch of the CIA . The dark branch handles clandestine operations , and for the past seven years , Tillingast had been in charge of the forty-five hundred employees working in that section . General Oliver Brooks was a West Point soldier who conducted his personal and professional life by the book . He was a company man , and the company he worked for was the United States Army . Floyd Baker , the secretary of state , was an anachronism , a throwback to an earlier era . He was of Southern vintage , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gallantry . He was a man who wore mental spats . He owned a chain of influential newspapers around the country , and was reputed to be enormously wealthy . There was no one in Washington with a keener political sense , and Baker 's antennae were constantly tuned to the changing signals around the halls of Congress . Pete Connors was black-Irish , a stubborn bulldog of a man , hard-drinking and fearless . This was his last year with the CIA . He faced compulsory retirement in June . Connors was chief of the counterintelligence staff , the most secret , highly compartmentalized branch of the CIA . He had worked his way up through the various intelligence divisions , and had  | been around in the good old days when ( ' IA agents were the golden boys . Pete Connors had been a golden boy himself . He had taken part in the coup that restored the Shah to the Peacock Throne in Iran , and had been involved in Operation Mongoose , the attempt to topple Castro 's government in 1961 . " After the Bay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from time to time . The length of his diatribe usually depended upon how drunk he was .

Some anti-CIA bastard published the names of our agents , and Dick Welch , our chief of station in Athens , was murdered . " Pete Connors had gone through three miserable marriages because of the pressures and secrecy of his work , but as far as he was concerned , no sacrifice was too great to make for his country . Now , in the middle of the meeting , his face was red with anger . " If we let the President get away with his fucking people-to-people program , he 's going to give the country away . It has to be stopped . We ca n't allow ? " Floyd Baker interrupted . " The President has been in office less than a week . We 're all here to carry out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hand over my country to the damned Commies , mister . The President never even mentioned his plan before his speech . He sprang it on all of us . We did n't have a chance to get together a rebuttal . " " Perhaps that 's what he had in mind , " Baker suggested . Pete Connors stared at him . " By God , you agree with it ! " " I le 's my President , " Floyd Baker said firmly . " Just as he 's yours . " Ned ' l'illingast turned to Stanton Rogers . " Connors has a point . The President is actually planning to invite Romania , Albania , Bulgaria , and the other Communist countries to send their spies here posing as cultural attaches and chauffeurs  | and secretaries and maids . We 're spending billions of dollars to guard the back door , and the President wants to throw open the front door . " General Brooks nodded agreement . " I was n't consulted , either . In my opinion , the President 's plan could damn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Gentlemen , some of us may disagree with the President , but let 's not forget that the people voted for Paul Ellison to run this country . " His eyes flicked across the men seated around him . " We 're all part of the President 's team , and we have to follow his lead and support him in every way we can . " His words were followed by a reluctant silence . " All right , then . The President wants an immediate update on the current situation in Romania . Everything you have . " " Including our covert stuff ? " Pete Connors asked . " Everything . Give it to me straight . What 's the situation in Romania with Alexandros lonescu ? " " Ionescu 's riding high in the saddle , " Ned Tillingast replied . " Once he got rid of the Ceau  --  escu family , all of Ceau ? escu 's allies were assassinated , jailed , or exiled . Since he seized power , lonescu 's been bleeding the country dry . The people hate his guts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Tillingast said , " Ah . That 's rather interesting . Remember a couple of years back when Marin Groza almost toppled the Ionescu government ? " " Yes . Groza got out of the country by the skin of his butt . " " With our help . Our information is that there 's a popular ground swell to bring him back . Groza would be good for Romania , and if he got in , it would be good for us . We 're keeping a close watch on the situation . " Stanton Rogers turned to the secretary of state . " Do you have that list of candidates for the Romanian post ? " Floyd Baker opened a leather attache case , took some papers from it , and handed a copy to Rogers . " These are our  | top prospects . They 're all qualified career diplomats . Each one of them has Stanton Rogers took the list , the secretary of state added , " Naturally , the State Department favors a career diplomat , rather than a political appointee . Someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In this situation , particularly . Romania is an extremely sensitive post . It has to be handled very carefully . " " I agree . " Stanton Rogers rose to his feet . " I 'll discuss these names with the President and get back to you . He 's anxious to fill the appointment as quickly as possible . " As the others got up to leave , Ned Tillingast said , " Stay here , Pete . I want to talk to you . " t When Tillingast and Connors were alone , Tillingast said , " You came on pretty strong , Pete . " " But I 'm right , " Pete Connors said stubbornly . " The President is trying to sell out the country . What are we supposed to do ? " " Keep your mouth shut . " " Ned , we 're trained to find the enemy and kill him . What if the enemy is behind our lines  --  sitting in the Oval Office ? " " Be careful . Be very careful . " Tillingast had been around longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wild Bill Donovan 's OSS before it became the CIA . He too hated what the bleeding hearts in Congress were doing to the organization he loved . In fact , there was a deep split within the ranks of the CIA between the hard-liners and those who believed the Russian bear could he tamed into a harmless pet . We have to fight for every single dollar , Tillingast thought . In Moscow , the Komitet Gosudarstvennoy Bezopasnosti  --  the KGB  --  trains a thousand agents at a time . Ned Tillingast had recruited Pete Connors out of college , and Connors had turned out to be one of the best . But in the Iust few years , Connors had become a cowboy  --  a little too  | independent , a little too quick on the trigger . Dangerous . " Pete  --  have you heard anything about an underground organization calling itself Patriots for Freedom ? " Tillingast asked . Connors frowned . " No . Ca n't say that I have . Who are they ? " " So far they 're just a rumor . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lead on them . " " Will do . " An hour later , Pete Connors was making a phone call from a public booth at Hains Point . " I have a message for Odin . " " This is Odin , " General Oliver Brooks said . Riding back to the office in his limousine , Stanton Rogers opened the envelope containing the names of the candidates for the ambassadorship and studied them . It was an excellent list . The secretary of state had done his homework . The candidates had all served in Eastern and Western European countries , and a few of them had additional experience in the Far East or Africa . The President 's going to be pleased , Stanton thought . " They 're dinosaurs , " Paul Ellison snapped . He threw the list down on his desk . " Every one of them . " " Paul , " Stanton protested , " these people are all experienced career diplomats . " " And hidebound by State Department tradition .

I know that there are a lot of powerful people who do n't want to see this work . If it fails , I 'm going to get cut off at the knees .

" Paul Ellison took a cigar from the humidor on his desk and lit it . " As a matter of fact , " he said slowly , " I think I may have . " " Who is he ? " " She . Did you happen to see the article in the current issue of Foreign Affairs magazine called Detente Now ' ? " " Yes . " " What did you think of it ? " " I thought it was interesting .

That 's no reason to consider her for a post as imp ? "  | " Stan  --  she went further than my theory . She outlined a detailed plan that 's brilliant . She wants to take the four major world economic pacts and combine them . " " How can we ? ? " " It would take time , but it could be done . Look . You know that in 1949 the Eastern-bloc countries formed a pact for mutual economic assistance , called COMECON , and in 1958 the other European countries formed the EEC  --  the Common Market .

" " You know the old Chinese saying , A journey of a thousand miles must begin with a single step . ' " She 's an amateur , Paul . " " Some of our finest ambassadors have been amateurs . Anne Armstrong , the former ambassador to Great Britain , was an educator with no political experience . Perle Mesta was appointed to Luxembourg , Clare Boothe Luce was ambassador to Italy .

There were twelve graduate students in the seminar being held in a classroom at Kansas State University 's Dykstra Hall . The students were seated in a semicircle facing Mary . he waiting lists to get into her classes were longer than any other professor 's at the university . She was a superb teacher , with an easy sense of humor and a warmth that made being around her a pleasure . She had an oval face that changed twin interesting to beautiful , depending on her mood . She had the high cheekbones of a model and almond-shaped hair ) eyes . Her hair was dark and thick . She had a figure that made her female students envious , and the males fantasize , ' rt she was unaware of how beautiful she was .  | Barry was wondering if she was happy with her husband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at hand . " Well , when Ionescu took over Romania , he cracked down on all the pro-Groza elements and reestablished a hard-line , pro-Soviet position . Even Ceau  --  escu was n't that bad . " Another student spoke up . " Then why is President Ellison so anxious to establish diplomatic relations with him ? " " Because we want to woo him into the Western orbit . " " Remember , " Mary said , " Nicolae Ceausescu also had a foot in both camps . What year did that start ? " Barry again . " In 1963 , when Romania took sides in the dispute between Russia and China to show its independence in international affairs . " " What about Romania 's current relationship with the other Warsaw Pact countries , and Russia in particular ? " Mary asked . " I 'd say it 's stronger now . " Another voice . " 1 do n't agree . Romania criticized Russia 's invasion of Afghanistan , and they criticized the Russians ' arrangement with the EEC . Also , Professor Ashley ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " Monday we 'll talk about the basic factors that affect the Soviet attitude toward Eastern Europe , and we 'll discuss the possible consequences of President Ellison 's plan to penetrate the Eastern bloc . Have a good weekend . " Mary watched the students rise and head for the door . " You too , Professor . " Mary Ashley loved the give-and-take of the seminar . History and geography came alive in the heated discussions among the bright young graduate students . Foreign names and places became real , and historical events took on flesh and blood . This was her fifth year on the faculty of Kansas State University , and teaching still excited her . She taught five political science classes a year in addition to the graduate seminars , and each of them dealt with the Soviet Union  | and its satellite countries . At times she felt like a fraud . I 've never been to any of the countries I teach about , she thought . I 've never even been outside the United States . Mary Ashley had been born @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only member of her family who had known Europe was her grandfather , who had come from the small Romanian village of Voronet . Mary had planned a trip abroad when she received her master 's degree , but that summer she met Edward Ashley , and the European trip turned into a three-day honeymoon at Waterville , fifty-five miles from Junction City , where Edward was taking care of a critical heart patient . " We really must travel next year , " Mary said to Edward shortly after they were married . " I 'm dying to see Rome and Paris and Romania . " " So am I. It 's a date . Next summer . " But that following summer Beth was born , and Edward was caught up in his work at the Geary Community Hospital . Two years later , Tim was born . Mary had gotten her Ph.D . and gone back to teaching at Kansas State University , and somehow the years had melted away . Except for brief trips to Chicago , Atlanta , and Denver , Mary had never been out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promised herself . One day Mary gathered her notes together and glanced out the window . Frost had painted the window a winter gray , and it was beginning to snow again . She put on her lined leather coat and a red woolen scarf and headed toward the Vattier Street entrance , where she had parked her car . the campus was huge , 315 acres dotted with eighty-seven buildings , including laboratories , theaters , and chapels , amid u rustic setting of trees and grass . From a distance , the brown limestone buildings of the university , with their turrets , re-  | sembled ancient castles ready to repel enemy hordes . As Mary passed Denison Hall , a stranger with a Nikon camera was walking toward her . He aimed the camera at the building and pressed the shutter . Mary was in the foreground of the picture . I should have got out of his way , she thought . I 've spoiled his picture . One hour later , the photograph was on its way to Washington , D.C. Every town has its own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people and the land . Junction City , in Geary County , is a farm community , population 20,381 , 130 miles west of Kansas City , priding itself on being the geographical center of the continental United States . It has a newspaper  --  The Daily Union  --  a radio station , and a television station . The downtown shopping area consists of a series of scattered stores and gas stations along Sixth Street and on Washington . There is a J. C. Penney 's , the First National Bank , a Domino Pizza , Flower Jeweler 's , and a Woolworth 's . There are fast-food chains , a bus station , a menswear shop , and a liquor store  --  the type of establishments that are duplicated in hundreds of small towns across the United States . But the residents of Junction City love it for its bucolic peace and tranquillity . On weekdays , at least . Weekends , Junction City becomes the rest-and-recreation center for the soldiers at nearby Fort Riley . Mary Ashley stopped to shop for dinner at Dillon 's Market on her way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lovely residential area overlooking a lake . Oak and elm trees lined the left side of the road , while on the right side were beautiful houses variously made of stone , brick , or wood . The Ashleys lived in a two-story stone house set in the middle of gently rolling hills . It had been bought by Dr. Ed-  | ward Ashley and his bride thirteen years earlier . It consisted of a large living room , dining room , library , breakfast room , and kitchen downstairs , and a master suite and two additional bedrooms upstairs . " It 's awfully large for just two people , " Mary Ashley had protested . Edward had taken her into his arms and held her close . " Who said it 's going to be for only two people ? " When Mary arrived home from the university , Tim and Beth were waiting to greet her . " Guess what ? " Tim said . " We 're going to have our pictures in the paper ! " " Help me put away the groceries , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man did n't say , but he took our pictures and he said we 'd hear from him . " Mary stopped and turned to look at her son . " Did this man say why ? " " No , " Tim said , " but he sure had a nifty Nikon . " On Sunday , Mary celebrated  --  although that was not the word that sprang to her mind  --  her thirty-fifth birthday . Edward had arranged a surprise party for her at the country club . Their neighbors , Florence and Douglas Schiffer , and four other couples were waiting for her . Edward was as delighted as a small child at the look of amazement on Mary 's lace when she walked into the club and saw the festive table and the happy birthday banner . She did not have the heart to tell him that she had known about the party for the past t wo weeks . She adored Edward . And why not ? Who would n't ? l i r was attractive and intelligent and caring . His grandfather , uf father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ f dward to be anything else . He was the best surgeon in Junction City , a good father , and a wonderful husband .  | As Mary blew out the candles on her birthday cake , she looked across at Edward and thought : How lucky can a lndv he ? Monday morning , Mary awoke with a hangover . There had been a lot of champagne toasts the night before , and she was not used to drinking alcohol . It took an effort to get out of bed . That champagne done me in . Never again , she promised herself . She eased her way downstairs and gingerly set about preparing breakfast for the children , trying to ignore the pounding in her head . " Champagne , " Mary groaned , " is France 's vengeance against us . " Beth walked into the room carrying an armful of books . Who are you talking to , Mother ? " " Myself . " ' Fhat 's weird . " " When you 're right , you 're right . " Mary put a box of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cereal for you . You 're going to like it . " Beth sat down at the kitchen table and studied the label on the cereal box . " I ca n't eat this . You 're trying to kill inc . ' ' " Do n't put any ideas in my head , " her mother cautioned . " Would you please eat your breakfast ? " Tim , her ten-year-old , ran into the kitchen . He slid into a chair at the table and said , " I 'll have bacon and eggs . " " Whatever happened to good morning ? " Mary asked . " Good morning . I 'll have bacon and eggs . " " Please . " " Aw , come on , Mom . I 'm going to be late for school . " " I 'm glad you mentioned that . Mrs. Reynolds called me . You 're failing math . What do you say to that ? " " It figures . " " Tim , is that supposed to be a joke ? "  | " I personally do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He made a face at his sister . " If you want funny , look in the mirror . " " That 's enough , " Mary said . " Behave yourselves . " Her headache was getting worse . Tim asked , " Can I go to the skating rink after school , Mom ? " " You 're already skating on thin ice . You 're to come right home and study . How do you think it looks for a college professor to have a son who 's failing math ? " " It looks okay . You do n't teach math . " They talk about the terrible twos , Mary thought grimly . What about the terrible nines , tens , elevens , and twelves ? Beth said , " Did Tim tell you he got a D in spelling ? " He glared at his sister . " Have n't you ever heard of Mark Twain ? " " What does Mark Twain have to do with this ? " Mary asked . " Mark Twain said he has no respect for a man who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't win , Mary thought . They 're smarter than we are . She had packed a lunch for each of them , but she was concerned about Beth , who was on some kind of crazy new diet . " Please , Beth , eat all of your lunch today . " " If it has no artificial preservatives . I 'm not going to let the greed of the food industry ruin my health . " Whatever happened to the good old days of junk food ? Mary wondered . Tim plucked a loose paper from one of Beth 's notebooks . " Look at this ! " he yelled . " Dear Beth , let 's sit together during study period . I thought of you all day yesterday and ? ' " " Give that back to me ! " Beth screamed . " That 's mine . " She made a grab for Tim , and he jumped out of her reach . Ile read the signature at the bottom of the note . " Hey !  | It 's signed Virgil . ' I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snatched the note away from him . " What would you know about love ? " Mary 's twelve-year-old daughter demanded . " You 're a child . " The pounding in Mary 's head was becoming unbearable . " Kids  --  give me a break . " She heard the horn of the school bus outside . Tim and Beth started toward the door . " Wait ! You have n't eaten your breakfasts , " Mary said . She followed them out into the hallway . " No time , Mother . Got to go . " " Bye , Mom . " " It 's freezing outside . Put on your coats and scarves . " " I ca n't . I lost my scarf , " Tim said . And they were gone . Mary felt drained . Motherhood is living in the eye of a hurricane . She looked up as Edward came down the stairs , and she felt a glow . Even after all these years , Mary thought , he 's still the most attractive man I 've ever known . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His eyes were a soft gray , reflecting a warm intelligence , but they could turn into twin blazes when he became impassioned about something . " Morning , darling . " He gave her a kiss . They walked into the kitchen . " Sweetheart  --  would you do me a favor ? " " Sure , beautiful . Anything . " " I want to sell the children . " " Both of them ? " " Both of them . " " When ? " " Today . " " Who 'd buy them ? " " Strangers . They 've reached the age where I ca n't do anything right . Beth has become a health-food freak , and your son is turning into a world-class dunce . "  | Edward said thoughtfully , " Maybe they 're not our kids . " " I hope not . I 'm making oatmeal for you . " He looked at his watch . " Sorry , darling . No time . I 'm due in surgery in half an hour . Hank Cates got tangled up in some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Is n't he too old to still be farming ? " " Do n't let him hear you say that . " Mary knew that Hank Cates had not paid her husband 's bills in three years . Like most of the farmers in the community , he was suffering from the low farm prices and the Farm Credit Administration 's indifferent attitude toward them . Many were losing farms they had worked on all their lives . Edward never pressed any of his patients for money , and many of them paid him with crops . The Ashleys had a cellar full of corn , potatoes , and wheat . One farmer had offered to give Edward a cow in payment , but when Edward told Mary about it , she said , " For heaven 's sake , tell him the treatment is on the house . " Mary looked at her husband now and thought again : How lucky I am . " Okay , " she said . " I may decide to keep the kids . I like their father a lot . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their mother . " Ile took her in his arms and held her close . " Happy birthday , plus one . " " Do you still love me now that I 'm an older woman ? " " I like older women . " " Thanks . " Mary suddenly remembered something . " I 've got to get home early today and prepare dinner . It 's our turn to have the Schiffers over . " Bridge with their neighbors was a Monday night ritual . The fact that Douglas Schiffer was a doctor and worked with Edv and at the hospital made them even closer . Mary and Edward left the house together , bowing their heads against the relentless wind . Edward strapped himself  | into his Ford Granada and watched Mary as she got behind the wheel of the station wagon . " The highway is probably icy , " Edward called . " Drive carefully . " " You too , darling . " She blew him a kiss , and the two cars drove away from the house , Edward heading toward the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where the university was located , sixteen miles away . Two men in an automobile parked half a block from the Ashley house watched the cars leave . They waited until the vehicles were out of sight . " Let 's go . " They drove up to the house next door to the Ashleys . Rex Olds , the driver , sat in the car while his companion walked up to the front door and rang the bell . The door was opened by an attractive brunette in her middle thirties . " Yes ? Can I help you ? " " Mrs. Douglas Schiffer ? " " Yes . . . ? " The man reached into his jacket pocket and pulled out an identification card . " My name is Donald Zamlock . I 'm with the Security Agency of the State Department . " " Good God ! Do n't tell me Doug has robbed a bank ! " The agent smiled politely . " No , ma'am . Not that we know of . I wanted to ask you a few questions about your neighbor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sudden concern . " Mary ? What about her ? " " May I come in ? " " Yes . Of course . " Florence Schiffer led him into the living room . " Sit down . Would you like some coffee ? " " No , thanks . I 'll only take a few minutes of your time . " " Why would you be asking about Mary ? " He smiled reassuringly . " This is just a routine check . She 's not suspected of any wrongdoing . "  | " I should hope not , " Florence Schiffer said indignantly . " Mary Ashley is one of the nicest persons you 'll ever meet . " She added , " Have you met her ? " " No , ma'am . This visit is confidential , and I would appreciate it if you kept it that way . How long have you known Mrs. Ashley ? " " About thirteen years . Since the day she moved in next door . " " Would you say that you know Mrs. Ashley well ? " " Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What ? ? " " Do she and her husband get along well ? " " Next to Douglas and me , they 're the happiest couple I 've ever known . " She thought a moment . " I take that back . They are the happiest couple I 've ever known . " " I understand Mrs. Ashley has two children . A girl twelve and a boy ten ? " " That 's right . Beth and Tim . " " Would you say she 's a good mother ? " " She 's a great mother . What 's ? ? " " Mrs. Schiffer , in your opinion , is Mrs. Ashley an emotionally stable person ? " " Of course she is . " " She has no emotional problems that you are aware of ? " " Certainly not . " " Does she drink ? " " No . She does n't like alcohol . " " What about drugs ? " " You 've come to the wrong town , mister . We do n't have a drug problem in Junction City @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Yes . " " If she wanted to get drugs ? ? " " You 're way off base . She does n't do drugs . She does n't snort , and she does n't shoot up . " Ile studied her a moment . " You seem to know all the terminology . "  | " I watch Miami Vice , like everybody else . " Florence Schiffer was getting angry . " Do you have any more ques-tions ? " " Mary Ashley 's grandfather was born in Romania . Have you ever heard her discuss Romania ? " " Oh , once in a while she 'll tell stories her grandfather told her about the old country . Her grandfather was born in Romania but he came over here when he was in his teens . " " Have you ever heard Mrs. Ashley express a negative opinion about the present Romanian government ? " " No . Not that I can remember . " " One last question . Have you ever heard Mrs. Ashley or Dr. Ashley say anything against the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in your estimation , they 're both loyal Americans ? " " You bet they are . Would you mind telling me ? ? " The man rose . " I want to thank you for your time , Mrs. Schiffer . And I 'd like to impress upon you again that this matter is highly confidential . I would appreciate it if you did n't discuss it with anyone  --  not even your husband . " A moment later he was out the door . Florence Schiffer stood there staring after him . " I do n't believe this whole conversation took place , " she said aloud . The two agents drove down Washington Street , heading north . They passed a billboard that read : ENJOY YOURSELF IN THE LAND OF AH 'S . " Cute , " Rex Olds grunted . They went by the chamber of commerce and the Royal Order of the Elks building , Irma 's Pet Grooming and a bar called The Fat Chance . The commercial buildings came to an abrupt end . Donald Zamlock said , " Jesus , the main @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a town . It 's a pit stop . "  | Rex Olds said , " To you it 's a pit stop , and to me it 's a pit stop , but to these people it 's a town . " Zamlock shook his head . " It 's probably a nice place to live , but I sure as hell would n't want to visit here . " The sedan pulled up in front of the state bank and Rex Olds went inside . He returned twenty minutes later . " Clean , " he said , getting into the car . " The Ashleys have seven thousand dollars in the bank , a mortgage on their house , and they pay their bills on time . The president of the bank thinks the doctor is too soft-hearted to be a good businessman , but as far as he 's concerned , he 's a top credit risk . " Zamlock looked at a clipboard at his side . " Let 's check out a few more names and get back to civilization before I begin to moo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man , but at the moment there was a grim expression on his face . The Schiffers and the Ashleys were in the middle of their weekly bridge game , and the Schiffers were ten thousand points behind . For the fourth time that evening , Florence Schiffer had reneged . Douglas Schiffer slammed down his cards . " Florence ! " he exploded . " Which side are you playing on ? Do you know how much we 're down ? " " I 'm sorry , " she said nervously . " I  --  I just ca n't seem to concentrate . " " Obviously , " her husband snorted . " Is anything bothering you ? " Edward Ashley asked Florence . " I ca n't tell you . " They all looked at her in surprise . " What does that mean ? " her husband asked . Florence Schiffer took a deep breath . " Mary  --  it 's about  | " What about me ? " " You 're in some sort of trouble , are n't you ? " Mary stared at her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think that ? " " I 'm not supposed to tell . I promised . " " You promised who ? " Edward asked . " A federal agent from Washington . He was at the house this morning asking me all kinds of questions about Mary . He made her sound like some kind of international spy . " " What kind of questions ? " Edward demanded . " Oh , you know . Was she a loyal American ? Was she a good wife and mother ? Was she on drugs ? " " Why the devil would they be asking you questions like that ? " " Wait a minute , " Mary said excitedly . " I think I know . It 's about my tenure . " " What ? " Florence asked . " I 'm up for tenure . The university does some sensitive government research on campus , so I suppose they have to check everyone pretty thoroughly . " " Well , thank God that 's all it is . " Florence Schiffer breathed a sigh of relief . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I hope they do , " Mary smiled . " At Kansas State . " " Well , now that that 's out of the way , " Douglas Schiffer said , " can we get on with the game ? " He turned to his wife . " If you renege one more time , I 'm going to put you over my knee . " " Promises , promises . "  | Abbeywood , England " We are meeting under the usual rules , " the chairman announced . " No records will be kept , this meeting will never he discussed , and we will refer to one another by the code names we have been assigned . " There were eight men inside the library of the fifteenthcentury Claymore Castle . Two armed men in plain clothes , bundled up in heavy overcoats , kept vigil outside , while a third man guarded the door to the library . The eight men inside the room had arrived at the site separately a short time earlier . The chairman continued . " The Controller has received some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alexandros Ionescu . A group of senior army officers in Romania has decided to back Groza . This time he could very well be successful . " t ) din spoke up . " How would that affect our plan ? " " I t could destroy it . It would open too many bridges to the West . "  | Freyr said , " Then we must prevent it from happening . " Balder asked , " How ? " " We assassinate Groza , " the chairman replied . " That 's impossible . Ionescu 's men have made half a dozen attempts that we know of , and they 've all failed . His villa seems to be impregnable . Anyway , no one in this room can afford to be involved in an assassination attempt . " " We would n't be directly involved , " the chairman said . " Then how ? " " The Controller discovered a confidential dossier that concerns an international terrorist who 's for hire . " " Abul Abbas , the man who organized the hijacking of the Achille Lauro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in town , gentlemen . A better one . He 's called Angel . " " Never heard of him , " Sigmund said . " Exactly . His credentials are most impressive . According to the Controller 's file , Angel was involved in the Sikh Khalistan assassination in India . He helped the Macheteros terrorists in Puerto Rico , and the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia . He 's masterminded the assassinations of half a dozen army officers in Israel and the Israelis have offered a million-dollar reward for him , dead or alive . " " He sounds promising , " Thor said . " Can we get him ? " " He 's expensive . If he agrees to take the contract , it will cost us two million dollars . " Freyr whistled , then shrugged . " That can be handled . We 'll take it from the general fund we 've set up . " " How do we get to this Angel person ? " Sigmund asked . " All his contacts are handled through his mistress , a woman named Neusa Munez . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She lives in Argentina . Angel has set her up in an apartment in Buenos Aires . " Thor said , " What would the next step be ? Who would get in touch with her for us ? "  | The chairman replied , " The Controller has suggested a man named Harry Lantz . " " That name sounds familiar . " The chairman said dryly , " Yes . He 's been in the newspapers . Harry Lantz is a maverick . He was thrown out of the CIA for setting up his own drug business in Vietnam . While he was with the CIA , he did a tour in South America , so he knows the territory . He 'd be a perfect go-between . " He paused . " I suggest we take a vote . All those in favor of hiring Angel , please raise your hands . " Eight well-manicured hands went into the air . " Then it 's settled . " The chairman rose . " The meeting is adjourned . Please observe the usual precautions . " It was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the greenhouse on the castle 's grounds , where he had no right to be . He was not alone , he later had to explain to his superiors . It was warm in the greenhouse , and his companion , Annie , a buxom country lass , had prevailed upon the good constable to bring a picnic hamper . " You supply the food , " Annie giggled , " and I 'll supply the dessert . " The " dessert " was five feet six inches , with beautiful , shapely breasts and hips that a man could sink his teeth into . Unfortunately , in the middle of dessert Constable Hanson 's concentration was distracted by a limousine driving out of the castle gate . This bloody place is supposed to be closed on Mondays , " he muttered . " Do n't lose your place , " Annie coaxed . " Not likely , pet . " Twenty minutes later , the constable heard a second car leaving . This time he was curious enough to get up and peer out the window . It looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the passengers . " Are you comin ' , then , Leslie ? "  | " Right . I just ca n't figure out who could be in the castle . Except for tour days , it 's closed down . " " Exactly what 's going to happen to me , love , if you do n't hop it . " Twenty minutes later , when Constable Hanson heard the third car leave , his libido lost out to his instincts as a policeman . There were five more vehicles , all limousines , all spaced twenty minutes apart . Because one of the cars stopped long enough to let a deer run by , Constable Hanson was able to note the license-plate number . " It 's supposed to be your bloody day off , " Annie complained . " This could be important , " the constable said . And even as he said it , he wondered whether he was going to report it . " What were you doing at Claymore Castle ? " Sergeant Twill demanded . " Sight-seeing , sir . " " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The greenhouse was open . " " So you decided to sight-see in the greenhouse ? " " Yes , sir . " " Alone , of course ? " " Well , to tell the truth ? " " Spare me the grotty details , Constable . What made you suspicious of the cars ? " " Their behavior , sir . " " Cars do n't behave , Hanson . Drivers do . " " Of course , sir . The drivers seemed very cautious . The cars left at intervals of twenty minutes . " " You are aware , of course , that there are probably a thousand innocent explanations . In fact , Hanson , the only one who does n't seem to have an innocent explanation is yourself . " " Yes , sir . But I thought I should report this . " " Right . Is this the license number you got ? "  | " Yes , sir . " " Very well . Be off with you . " He thought of one witticism to add . " Remember  --  it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a glass house . " He chuckled at his bon mot all morning . When the report on the license plate came back , Sergeant Twill decided that Hanson had made a mistake . He took his information upstairs to Inspector Pakula and explained the background . " I would n't have bothered you with this , Inspector , but the license-plate number ? " " Yes . I see . I 'll take care of it . " ' " Thank you , sir . " At SIS Headquarters , Inspector Pakula had a brief meeting with one of the senior heads of the British Secret Intelligence Service , a beefy , florid-faced man , Sir Alex HydeWhite . " You were quite right to bring this to my attention , " Sir Alex smiled , " but I 'm afraid it 's nothing more sinister than trying to arrange a royal vacation trip without the press being aware of it . " " I 'm sorry to have bothered you about this . " Inspector Pakula rose to his feet . " Not at all , Inspector . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you say the name of that young constable was ? " " Hanson , sir . Leslie Hanson . " When the door closed behind Inspector Pakula , Sir Alex Hyde-White picked up a red telephone on his desk . " I have a message for Balder . We have a small problem . I 'll explain it at the next meeting . Meanwhile , I want you to arrange for three transfers . Police Sergeant Twill , an Inspector Pakula , and Constable Leslie Hanson . Spread them out a few days . ? N ant them sent to separate posts , as far from London as  | possible . I 'll inform the Controller and see if he wants to take any further action . " In his hotel room in New York , Harry Lantz was awakened in the middle of the night by the ringing of the telephone . Who the hell knows I 'm here ? he wondered . He looked blearily at the bedside clock , then snatched up the phone . " It 's four o'fucking clock in the morning ! Who the ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the line began speaking , and Lantz sat upright in bed , his heart beginning to pound . " Yes , sir , " he said . " Yes , sir . . . . No , sir , but I can arrange to make myself free . " He listened for a long time . Finally he said , " Yes , sir . I understand . I 'll be on the first plane to Buenos Aires . Thank you , sir . " He replaced the receiver and lit a cigarette . His hands were trembling . The man he had just spoken to was one of the most powerful men in the world , and what he had asked Harry to do . . . What the hell is going down ? Harry Lantz asked himself . Something big . The man was going to pay him fifty thousand dollars to deliver a message . It would be fun going back to Argentina . Harry Lantz loved the South American women . I know a dozen bitches there with hot pants who would rather fuck than eat . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lantz picked up the telephone and dialed the number of Aerolineas Argentinas . " What time is your first flight to Buenos Aires ? " The 747 arrived at Ezeiza Airport in Buenos Aires at five P.M. the following afternoon . It had been a long flight , but Harry Lantz had not minded it . Fifty thousand dollars for delivering a message . He felt a surge of excitement as the wheels lightly kissed the ground . He had not been to Argen-  | tina for almost five years . It would be fun to renew old acquaintances . As Harry Lantz stepped out of the plane , the blast of hot air startled him for a moment . Of course . It 's summer here . During the taxi ride into the city , Lantz was amused to see that the graffiti scrawled on the sides of buildings and sidewalks had not changed . PLEBISCITO LAS PELOTAS ( Fuck the plebiscite ) . MILITARES , ASESINOS ( Army , assassins ) . TENEMOS HAMBRE ( We are hungry ) . MARIHUANA LIBRE ( Free pot ) .

Siesta was over and the streets were crowded with people lazily walking to and from appointments . When the taxi arrived at the Hotel El Conquistador in the heart of the fashionable Barrio Norte sector , Lantz paid the driver with a million-peso note . " Keep the change , " he said . Their money was a joke . He registered at the desk in the huge , modern lobby , picked up a copy of the Buenos Aires Herald and La Prensa , and let the assistant manager show him to his suite . Sixty dollars a day for a bedroom , bathroom , living room , and kitchen , air-conditioned , with television . In Washington , this setup would cost an arm and a leg , Harry Lantz thought . I 'll take care of my business with this Neusa broad tomorrow , and stay around a few days and enjoy myself . I t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to track down Neusa Munez . his search began with the city telephone directories . Lantz %tarted with the places in the heart of the city : Area ConstituriOn , Plaza San Martin , Barrio Norte , Catelinas Norte . None of them had a listing for a Neusa Munez . Nor was there any  | listing in the outlying areas of Bahia Blanca or Mar del Plata . Where the hell is she ? Lantz wondered . He took to the streets , looking up old contacts . He walked into La Biela , and the bartender cried out , " Senor Lantz ! Por dios  --  I heard you were dead . " Lantz grinned . " I was , but I missed you so much , Antonio , I came back . " " What are you doing in Buenos Aires ? " Lantz let his voice grow pensive . " I came here to find an old girl friend . We were supposed to get married , but her family moved away and I lost track of her . Her name is Neusa Munez . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Lo siento . " " Would you ask around , Antonio ? " " zPor que no ? " Lantz 's next stop was to see a friend at police headquarters . " Lantz ! Harry Lantz ! /Dios ! zQue pasa ? " " Hello , Jorge . Nice to see you , amigo . " " Last I heard about you , the CIA kicked you out . " Harry Lantz laughed . " No way , my friend . They begged me to stay . I quit to go into business for myself . " " ; Si ? What business are you in ? " " I opened up my own detective agency . As a matter of fact , that 's what brings me to Buenos Aires . A client of mine died a few weeks ago . He left his daughter a bundle of money , and I 'm trying to locate her . All the information I have on her is that she lives in an apartment somewhere in Buenos Aires . " " What 's her name ? " " Neusa Munez @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment stretched into half an hour .  | " Sorry , amigo . I ca n't help you . She is not in our computer or in any of our files . " " Oh , well . If you should come across any information about her , I 'm at the El Conquistador . " " Bueno . " The bars were next . Old familiar haunts . The Pepe Gonzalez andAlmeida , Cafe Tabac . " Buenas tardes , amigo . Soy de los Estados Unidos . Estoy buscando una mujer . El nombre es Neusa Munez . Es una emergencia . " Lo siento , senor . No la conozco . " The answer was the same everywhere . No one has ever heard of the fucking broad . Harry Lantz wandered around La Boca , the colorful waterfront area where one could see old ships rusting at anchor in the river . No one around there knew of Neusa Mu-iez . For the first time , Harry Lantz began to feel he might he on a wild-goose chase . It was at the Pilar , a small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suddenly changed . It was a Friday night and the bar was filled with workingmen . It took Lantz ten minutes to get the bartender 's attention . Before Lantz was halfway through his prepared speech , the bartender said , " Neusa Munez ? Si . I know her . If she wishes to talk to you , she will come here manana , about midnight . " The following evening , Harry Lantz returned to the Pilar at eleven o'clock , watching the bar gradually fill up . As midnight approached , he found himself getting more and more nervous . What if she did not show up ? What if it was the %tong Neusa Munez ? I . antz watched as a group of giggling young women came into the bar . They joined some men at a table . She 's got to  | show up , Lantz thought . If she does n't , I can kiss the fifty grand good-bye . He wondered what she looked like . She had to be a stunner . He was authorized to offer her boyfriend , Angel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so Angel was probably up to his ass in millions . He would be well able to afford a beautiful young mistress . Hell , he could probably afford a dozen of them . This Neusa had to be an actress or model . Who knows , maybe I can have a little fun with her before I leave town . Nothing like combining business and pleasure , Harry Lantz thought happily . The door opened and Lantz looked up expectantly . A woman was walking in alone . She was middle-aged and unattractive , with a fat , bloated body and huge , pendulous breasts that swayed as she walked . Her face was pockmarked , and she had dyed blond hair , but her dark complexion indicated mestizo blood inherited from an Indian ancestor who had been bedded by a Spaniard . She was dressed in an ill-fitting skirt and sweater meant for a much younger woman . A hooker down on her luck , Lantz decided . But who the hell would want to fuck her ? The woman looked around the bar with vacant , listless eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her way through the crowd . She walked up to the bar . " Wan na buy me a drink ? " She had a heavy Spanish accent , and up close she was even more unattractive . She looks like a fat , unmilked cow , Lantz thought . And she 's drunk . " Get lost , sister . " " Esteban say you are lookin ' for me , no ? " He stared at her . " Who ? " " Esteban . The bartender . " Harry Lantz still could not accept it . " He must have made a mistake . I 'm looking for Neusa Munez . " " Si . Yo soy Neusa Munez . " But the wrong one , Harry Lantz thought . Shit ! " Are you Angel 's friend ? "  | She smiled drunkenly . " Si . " Harry Lantz recovered swiftly . " Well , well . " He forced a smile . " Can we go to a corner table and talk ? " She nodded indifferently . " Ess okay . " They fought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were seated , Harry Lantz said , " I 'd like to talk about ? " " You buy me a rum , si ? " Lantz nodded . " Sure thing . " A waiter appeared , wearing a filthy apron , and Lantz said , " One rum and a Scotch and soda . " Munez said , " Make mine a double , huh ? " ' When the waiter left , Lantz turned to the woman seated beside him . " I want to meet with Angel . " She studied him with her dull , watery eyes . " Wha ' for ? " Lantz lowered his voice . " I have a little present for him . " " iSi ? What kin ' a presen ' ? " " Two million dollars . " Their drinks arrived . Harry Lantz raised his glass and said , " Cheers . " " Yeah . " She downed her drink in one gulp . " Wha ' for you wan na give Angel two million dollars ? " " That 's something I 'll have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Angel , he don ' talk to nobody . " " Lady , for two million dollars ? " " Kin I have ' nother rum ? A double , huh ? " My God , she already looks like she 's about to pass out . " Sure . " Lantz summoned the waiter and ordered the drink . " Have you known Angel a long time ? " He made his tone casual . She shrugged . " Yeah . " " He must be an interesting man . " Her vacant eyes were fixed on a spot on the table in front of her . Jesus ! Harry Lantz thought . It 's like trying to have a conversation with a fucking wall .  | Her drink arrived , and she finished it in one long swallow . She has the body of a cow and the manners of a pig . " How soon can I talk to Angel ? " Neusa Munez struggled to her feet . " I tol ' you , he don ' talk to nobody . Adios . " Harry Lantz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wait a minute ! Do n't go . " She stopped and looked down at him with bleary eyes . " What you wan ' ? " " Sit down , " Lantz said slowly , " and I 'll tell you what I want . " She sat down heavily . " I need a rum , huh ? " Harry Lantz was baffled . What the fuck kind of man is this Angel ? His mistress is not only the ugliest broad in all of South America , but she 's a lush . Lantz did not like dealing with drunks . They were too unreliable . On the other hand , he hated the thought of losing his fifty-thousand-dollar commission . He watched as Munez gulped her drink . He wondered how many she had had before coming to meet him . Lantz smiled and said reasonably , " Neusa , if I ca n't talk to Angel , how can I do business with him ? " " Ess simple . You tell me what you wan ' . I tell Angel . If he say si @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I tell you no . " Harry Lantz distrusted using her as a go-between , but he had no choice . " You 've heard of Marin Groza . " " No . " Of course she had n't . Because it was n't the name of a rum . This stupid bitch was going to get the message all wrong and screw up the deal for him . " I need a drink , huh ? " He patted her fat hand . " Certainly . " He ordered another double rum . " Angel will know who Groza is . You just say Marin Groza . He 'll know . " " Yeah ? Then wha ' ? " She was even stupider than she looked . What the fuck did  | she think Angel was supposed to do for two million dollars ? Kiss the guy ? Harry Lantz said carefully , " The people who sent me want him blown away . " She blinked . " Whas blown away ' ? " Christ ! " Killed . " " Oh . " She nodded indifferently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice was beginning to slur even more . " Wha ' you say the man 's name is ? " He wanted to shake her . " Groza . Marin Groza . " " Yeah . My baby 's outa town . I 'll call him tonight an ' meet you here tomorrow . Kin I have ' nother rum ? " Neusa Munez was turning out to be a nightmare . The following evening , Harry Lantz sat at the same table in the bar from midnight until four in the morning , when the bar closed . Munez did not appear . " Do you know where she lives ? " Lantz asked the bartender . The bartender looked at him with innocent eyes . " Quien Babe ? " The bitch had fouled everything up . How could a man who was supposed to be as smart as Angel get hooked up with such a rum dummy ? Harry Lantz prided himself on being a pro . He was too smart to walk into a deal like this without first checking it out . He had cautiously asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the Israelis had put a price of a million dollars on Angel 's head . A million bucks would buy a lifetime worth of booze and young hookers . Well , he could forget about that and he could forget about his fifty thousand . His only link to Angel had been broken . He would have to call The Man and tell him he had failed . l ri'o n't call him yet , Harry Lantz decided . Maybe she 'll come back here . Maybe the other bars will run out of rum . 1ta ' be I should have had my ass kicked for saying yes to this fucking assignment .  |  | The following night at eleven o'clock , Harry Lantz was seated at the same table in the Pilar , intermittently chewing peanuts and his fingernails . At two A.M. he saw Neusa Munez stumble in the door , and Harry 's heart soared . He watched as she made her way over to his table . " Hi , " she mumbled , and slumped into a chair . " What happened to you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do to control his anger . She blinked . " Huh ? " " You were supposed to meet me here last night . " " Yeah ? " " We made a date , Neusa . " " Oh . I went to a movie with a girlfrien ' . There 's this new movie , see ? Ess ' bout this man who falls in love with this tuckin ' nun an ' ? " Lantz was so frustrated he could have wept . What could Angel possibly see in this dumb , drunken bitch ? She must  | have a golden pussy , Lantz decided . " Neusa  --  did you remember to talk to Angel ? " She looked at him vacantly , trying to understand the question . " Angel ? Si . Kin I have a drink , huh ? " He ordered a double rum for her and a double Scotch for himself . He needed it desperately . " What did Angel say , Neusa ? " " Angel ? Oh , he say yeah . Ess okay . " Harry Lantz felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He no longer gave a damn about his messenger-boy mission . He had thought of a better idea . This drunken bitch was going to lead him to Angel . One million dollars reward money . He watched her slop down her drink , spilling some of it down her already soiled blouse . " What else did Angel say ? " Her brow knit in concentration . " Angel , he say he wan na know who your people are . " Lantz gave her a winning smile . " You tell him that 's confidential , Neusa . I ca n't give him that information . " She nodded , indifferent . " Then Angel say to tell you to fuck off . Kin I have a rum ' fore I go ? " Harry Lantz 's mind started working at top speed . If she left , he was sure he would never see her again . " I 'll tell you what I 'll do , Neusa . I 'll telephone the people I 'm working for , and if they give me permission , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shrugged . " I don ' care . " " No , " Lantz explained patiently , " but Angel does . So you tell him I 'll have an answer for him by tomorrow . Is there someplace I can reach you ? " " I guess so . " He was making progress . " Where ? " " Here . " Her drink arrived , and he watched her gulp it down like an animal . Lantz wanted to kill her .  | Lantz made the telephone call collect , so it could not be traced , from a public-telephone booth on Calvo Street . It had taken him one hour to get through . " No , " the Controller said . " I told you that no names are to be mentioned . " " Yes , sir . But there 's a problem . Neusa Munez , Angel 's mistress , says he 's willing to make a deal , but he wo n't move without knowing who he 's dealing with . Naturally , I told her I had to check it out with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " The Controller was not a man to play games with . " She 's fat and ugly and stupid , sir . " " It 's much too dangerous for my name to be used . " Harry Lantz could feel the deal slipping away from him . " Yes , sir , " he said earnestly . " I understand . The only thing is , sir , Angel 's reputation is based on his being able to keep his mouth shut . If he ever started talking , he would n't last five minutes in his business . " There was a long silence . " You have a point . " There was another silence , even longer . " Very well . You may give Angel my name . But he is never to divulge it , and never to contact me directly . He 'll work only through you . " Harry Lantz could have danced . " Yes , sir . I 'll tell him . Thank you , sir . " He hung up , a big grin on his face . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And then the million-dollar reward . When Harry Lantz met Neusa Munez late that evening , he immediately ordered a double rum for her and said , happily , " Everything 's set . I got permission . " She looked at him indifferently . " Yeah ? " He told her the name of his employer . It was a household word , and he expected her to be impressed . She shrugged . " Never hearda him . "  | " Neusa , the people I work for want this done as quickly as possible . Marin Groza is hiding out in a villa in Neuilly , and ? " " Where ? " God Almighty ! He was trying to communicate with a drunken moron . He said patiently , " It 's a little town outside of Paris . Angel will know . " " I need ' nother drink . " An hour later , Neusa was still drinking . and this time Harry Lantz was encouraging her . Not that she needs much encouragement , Lantz thought . When she 's drunk enough , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest will be easy . He looked over at Neusa Munez staring filmy-eyed into her drink . It should n't be hard to catch Angel . He may be tough , but he ca n't be very bright . " When is Angel coming back to town ? " She focused her watery eyes on him . " Nex ' week . " Harry Lantz took her hand and stroked it . " Why do n't you and I go back to your place ? " he asked softly . " Oka " Y ? He was in . Neusa Munez lived in a shabby two-room apartment in the Belgrano district of Buenos Aires . The apartment was messy and unkempt , like its tenant . When they walked through the door , Neusa made straight for the little bar in the corner . She was unsteady on her feet . " How ' bout a drink ? " " Not for me , " Lantz said . " You go ahead . " He watched as she poured out a drink and downed it . She 's the most ugly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the million dollars is going to be beautiful . He looked around the apartment . There were some books piled on a coffee table . He picked them up , one by one , hop-  | ing to get an insight into Angel 's mind . The titles surprised him : Gabriela , Clove &; Cinnamon , by Jorge Amado ; Fire from the Mountain , by Omar Cabezas ; One Hundred Years of Solitude , by Gabriel Garcia Marquez ; At Night the Cats , by Antonio Cisneros . So Angel was an intellectual . The books did not fit with the apartment or the woman . Lant7 , walked over to her and put his arms around her huge , flabby waist . " You 're damned cute , do you know that ? " He reached up and stroked her breasts . They were the size of watermelons . Lantz hated big-breasted women . " You 've got a really great body . " " Huh ? " Her eyes were glazed . Lantz 's arms moved down and stroked her fat thighs through the thin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " he whispered . " Wha ' ? " He was getting nowhere . He had to think of an approach that would get this amazon into bed . But he knew he had to make his move carefully . If he offended her , she might go back and report him to Angel , and that would be the end of the deal . He could try to sweet-talk her , but she was too drunk to know what he was saying . As Lantz was desperately trying to think of a clever gambit , Neusa mumbled , " Wan na fuck ? " He grinned in relief . " That 's a great idea , baby . " " Come on ' n the bedroom . " She was stumbling as Lantz followed her into the small bedroom . It contained one closet with the door ajar , a large unmade bed , two chairs , and a bureau with a cracked mirror above it . It was the closet that caught Harry Lantz 's attention . In it he glimpsed a row of men 's suits hanging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bed , fumbling with the buttons on her blouse . Under ordinary circumstances , Harry I . antz would have been at her side , undressing her , caressing her body and murmuring exciting indecencies into her ear .  | But the sight of Munez sickened him . He stood there watching as her skirt dropped to the floor . She was wearing nothing under it . Naked , she was uglier than when dressed . Her huge breasts sagged , and her protruding stomach shook like jelly as she moved . Her fat thighs were a mass of cellulite . She 's the grossest thing I 've ever seen , Lantz thought . Think positively , Lantz told himself . This will be over in a few minutes . The million bucks will last forever . Slowly , he forced himself to get undressed . She was propped up in bed like a leviathan , waiting for him , and he crawled in beside her . " What do you like ? " he asked . " Huh ? Choc'late . I like choc'late . " She was drunker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will make things easier . He began to caress her flabby , fish-white body . " You 're a very pretty woman , hon. You know that ? " " Yeah ? " " I like you a lot , Neusa . " His hands moved down toward the hairy mound between her fat legs , and he began to make small , titillating circles . " I 'll bet you live an exciting life . " " Huh ? " " I mean  --  being Angel 's girl friend . That must be really interesting . Tell me , baby , what 's Angel like ? " There was a silence , and he wondered if Neusa had fallen asleep . He inserted his fingers in the soft , damp cleft between her legs , and felt her stir . " Do n't go to sleep , sweetheart . Not yet . What kind of man is Angel ? Is he handsome ? " " Rich . Angel , he 's rich . " Lantz 's hand continued its work . " Is he good to you ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'm going to be good to you too , baby . " His voice was soft . His problem was that everything was soft . What he needed was a million-dollar erection . He started thinking about the Dolly sisters and some of the things they had done to him . He visualized them working on his naked body with  | their tongues and fingers and nipples , and his penis began to grow hard . He quickly rolled over on top of Neusa and inserted himself into her . God , it 's like sticking it in a fucking pudding , Harry Lantz thought . " Does that feel good ? " " Ess okay , I guess . " He could have strangled her . There were dozens of beautiful women around the world who were thrilled by his lovemaking , and this fat bitch was saying , Ess okay , I guess . He began moving his hips back and forth . " Tell me about Angel . Who are his friends ? " Her voice was drowsy . " Angel got no frens . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , babe . Does Angel live here with you , or does he have his own place ? " Neusa closed her eyes . " Hey , I 'm sleepy . When you gon na come ? " Never , he thought . Not with this cow . " I already came , " Lantz lied . " Then le 's go to sleep . " He rolled off her and lay at her side , fuming . Why could n't Angel have had a normal mistress ? Someone young and beautiful and hot-blooded . Then he would have had no trouble getting the information he needed . But this stupid bitch ? ! Still . . . there were other ways . Lantz lay there quietly for a long time , until he was certain Neusa was asleep . Then he carefully arose from the bed and padded over to the closet . He switched the closet light on and closed the door so the light would not awaken the snoring behemoth . There were a dozen suits and sports outfits hanging on the rack , and six pairs of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jackets and examined the labels . The suits were all custom-made by Herrera , Avenida la Plata . The shoes were made by Vill . I 've hit the jackpot ! Lantz gloated . They 'll have a record of Angel 's address . I 'll go to the shop first thing in the morning and ask a few questions . A warning sounded in his mind . No . No questions . He had to be more clever than  | that . He was , after all , dealing with a world-class assassin . It would be safer to let Neusa lead him to Angel . Then all I have to do is tip off my friends in the Mossad and collect the reward . I 'll show Ned Tillingast and the rest of the fucking CIA bunch that old Harry Lantz has n't lost his touch . All the bright boys have been chasing their asses trying to find Angel , and I 'm the only one smart enough to pull it off . He thought he heard a sound from the bed . He carefully peeked out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lantz turned out the closet light and walked over to the bed . Munez 's eyes were closed . Lantz tiptoed to the bureau and began looking through the drawers , hoping to find a photograph of Angel . That would be a help . No luck . He crept back into bed . Neusa was snoring loudly . When Harry Lantz finally drifted off to sleep , his dreams were filled with visions of a white yacht crowded with beautiful naked girls with small , firm breasts . In the morning when Harry Lantz awoke , Neusa was gone . For an instant , Lantz panicked . Had she already left to meet Angel ? He heard noises in the kitchen . He hurried out of bed and slipped into his clothes . Neusa was at the stove . " Buenos dias , " Lantz said . " Wan ' coffee ? " Neusa mumbled . " I ca n't fix no breakfast . I got ' n appointment . " With Angel . Harry Lantz tried to hide his excitement . " That 's fine . I 'm not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appointment and we 'll meet for dinner tonight . " He put his arms around her , fondling her pendulous breasts . " Where would you like to have dinner ? Nothing but the best for my girl . " I should have been an actor , Lantz thought . " I don ' care . " " Do you know Chiquin on Avenida Cangallo ? " " No . " " You 'll like it . Why do n't I pick you up here at eight  | o'clock ? I have a lot of business to attend to today . " He had no business to attend to . " Oka " Y ? It took all his willpower to lean over and kiss Neusa goodbye . Her lips were flabby and wet and disgusting . " Eight o'clock . " Lantz walked out of the apartment and hailed a taxi . He hoped Neusa was watching from the window . " Turn right at the next corner , " he instructed the driver . When they had turned the corner , Harry Lantz said , " I 'll get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprise . " You wish to ride only one block , senor ? " " Right . I have a bad leg . War wound . " Harry Lantz paid him , then hurried back to a tobacconist shop across from Neusa 's apartment building . He lit a cigarette and waited . Twenty minutes later , Neusa came out of the apartment building . Harry watched as she waddled down the street , and he followed her at a careful distance . There was no chance of his losing her . It was like following the Lusitania . Neusa Munez seemed to be in no hurry . She moved down the Avenida Belgrano , past the Spanish library , and plodded along the Avenida Cordoba . Lantz watched as she walked into Berenes , a leather shop on San Martin . He stood across the street and observed her chatting with a male clerk . Lantz wondered whether the shop could be a connection with Angel . He made a mental note of it . Neusa came out a few minutes later carrying a small package . Her next stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cream . She walked down San Martin , moving slowly . She seemed to be strolling aimlessly with no particular destination in mind . What the hell happened to her appointment ? Lantz wondered . Where is Angel ? He did not believe Neusa 's state-  | ment that Angel was out of town . His instincts told him that Angel was somewhere nearby . Lantz suddenly realized that Neusa Munez was not in sight . She had turned a corner ahead and disappeared . He quickened his step . When Lantz rounded the corner , she was nowhere to be seen . There were small shops on both sides of the street , and Lantz moved carefully , his eyes searching everywhere , fearful that Neusa might see him before he saw her . He finally spied her in a fiambreria , a delicatessen , buying groceries . Were they for her , or was she expecting someone at her apartment for lunch ? Someone named Angel . From a distance , Lantz watched Neusa enter a verduleria and buy fruit and vegetables . He trailed her back to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there had been no suspicious contacts . Harry Lantz watched Neusa 's building from across the street for the next four hours , moving around to make himself as inconspicuous as possible . Finally he decided that Angel was not going to show up . Maybe I can get some more information out of her tonight , Lantz thought , without fucking her . The idea of having to make love to Neusa again sickened him . In the Oval Office at the White House , it was evening . It had been a long day for Paul Ellison . The entire world seemed to be composed of committees and councils and urgent cables and conclaves and sessions and he had not had a moment to himself until now . Well , almost to himself . Stanton Rogers was sitting across from him , and the President found himself relaxing for the first time that day . " I 'm keeping you from your family , Stan . " " That 's all right , Paul . "  | " I wanted to talk to you about the Mary Ashley investigation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost completed . We 'll have a final check on her by tomorrow or the next day . So far it looks very good . I 'm getting excited about the idea . I think it 's going to work . " " We 'll make it work . Would you like another drink ? " " No , thanks . Unless you need me for anything else , I 'm taking Barbara to an opening at the Kennedy Center . " " You go ahead , " Paul Ellison said . " Alice and I are due to entertain some relatives of hers . " " Please give my love to Alice , " Stanton Rogers said . He rose . " And you give mine to Barbara . " He watched Stanton Rogers leave . The President 's thoughts turned to Mary Ashley . When Harry Lantz arrived at Neusa 's apartment that evening to take her out to dinner , there was no answer to his knock . He felt a moment of consternation . Had she walked out on him ? He tried the door , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Perhaps he had decided to discuss the contract face-to-face . Harry assumed a brisk , businesslike manner and walked in . The room was empty . " Hello . " Only an echo . He went into the bedroom . Neusa was lying across the bed , drunk . " You dumb ? " He caught himself . He must not forget that this stupid , drunken broad was his gold mine . He put his hands on her shoulders and tried to rouse her . She opened her eyes . " Wha'sa matter ? " " I 'm worried about you , " Lantz said . His voice throbbed with sincerity . " I hate to see you unhappy , and I think you 're drinking because someone is making you unhappy . I 'm your friend . You can tell me all about it . It 's Angel , is n't it ? "  | " Angel , " she mumbled . " I 'm sure he 's a nice man , " Harry Lantz said soothingly . " You two probably just had a little misunderstanding , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bed . It 's like beaching a whale , Lantz thought . Lantz sat down beside her . " Tell me about Angel , " Lantz said . " What 's he doing to you ? " Neusa stared up at him , bleary-eyed , trying to focus on him . " Les fuck . " Oh , Jesus ! It was going to be a long night . " Sure . Great idea . " Reluctantly , Lantz began to undress . When Harry Lantz awakened in the morning alone in bed , memories came flooding into his brain , and he felt sick to his stomach . Neusa had awakened him in the middle of the night . " You know wha ' I wan ' you to do to me ? " she mumbled . She told him . He had listened in disbelief , but he did the things she had asked him to do . He could not afford to antagonize her . She was a sick , wild animal , and Lantz wondered whether Angel had ever done those things for her . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to vomit . He heard Neusa singing off-key in the bathroom . He was not sure he could face her . I 've had enough , Lantz thought . If she does n't tell me this morning where Angel is , I 'm going to his tailor and shoemaker . He threw back the covers and went in to Neusa . She was standing in front of the bathroom mirror . Her hair was in fat curlers , and she looked , if possible , even more unattractive than before . " You and I are going to have a talk , " Lantz said firmly . " Sure . " Neusa pointed to the bathtub full of water . " 1 fix a bath for you . When you 're finish ' , I fix breakfast . " Lantz was impatient , but he knew he must not press too hard .  | " You like omelettes ? " He had no appetite . " Yeah . Sounds great . " " I make good omelettes . Angel teach me . " Lantz watched as she started to take the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stepped into the bathtub . Neusa picked up a large electric dryer , plugged it in , and began drying her hair . Lantz lay back in the warm tub thinking : Maybe I should get a gun and take Angel myself . If I let the Israelis do it , there 'll probably be a fucking inquiry into who gets the reward . This way there wo n't be any question . I 'll just tell them where to pick up his body . Neusa said something , but Harry Lantz could barely hear her over the roar of the hair dryer . " What did you say ? " he called out . Neusa moved to the side of the tub . " I got a presen ' for you from Angel . " She dropped the electric hair dryer into the water and stood there watching as Lantz 's body twitched in a dance of death .  |  | President Paul Ellison put down the last security report on Mary Ashley and said , " Not a blemish , Stan . " " I know . I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ State is n't going to be happy . " " We 'll send them a crying towel . Now let 's hope the Senate will back us up . " Mary Ashley 's office in Kedzie Hall was a small , pleasant room lined with bookcases that were crammed with reference books on Middle European countries . The furniture was sparse , consisting of a battered desk with a swivel chair , a small table at the window piled with examination papers , a ladder-back chair , and a reading lamp . On the wall behind the desk was a map of the Balkans . An ancient photograph of Mary 's grandfather hung on the wall . It had been taken around the turn of the century , and the figure in the photograph was standing in a stiff , unnatural pose , dressed in the  | clothes of the period . The picture was one of Mary 's treasures . It had been her grandfather who had instilled in her a deep curiosity about Romania . He had told her romantic stories of Queen Marie , and baronesses and princesses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Alexander II , czar of Russia , and dozens of other thrilling characters . Somewhere in our background there is royal blood . If the revolution had not come , you would have been a princess . She used to have dreams about it . Mary was in the middle of grading examination papers when the door opened and Dean Hunter walked in . " Good morning , Mrs. Ashley . Do you have a moment ? " It was the first time the dean had ever visited her office . Mary felt a sudden sense of elation . There could be only one reason for the dean coming here himself : He was going to tell her that the university was giving her tenure . " Of course , " she said . " Wo n't you sit down ? " He sat down on the ladder-back chair . " How are your classes going ? " " Very well , I think . " She could not wait to relay the news to Edward . He would be so proud . It was seldom that someone her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ill at ease . " Are you in some kind of trouble , Mrs. Ashley ? " The question caught her completely off guard . " Trouble ? I  --  no . Why ? " " Some men from Washington have been to see me , asking questions about you . " Mary Ashley heard the echo of Florence Schiffer 's words : Some federal agent from Washington . . . . He was asking all kinds of questions about Mary . He made her sound like some kind of international spy . . . . Was she a loyal American ? Was she a good wife and a good mother ? . . . So it had not been about her tenure , after all . She sud-  | denly found it difficult to speak . " What  --  what did they want to know , Dean Hunter ? " " They inquired about your reputation as a professor , and they asked questions about your personal life . " " I ca n't explain it . I really do n't know what 's going on . I 'm in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know , " she added lamely . He was watching her with obvious skepticism . " Did n't they tell you why they were asking questions about me ? " " No . As a matter of fact , I was asked to keep the conversation in strict confidence . But I have a loyalty to my staff , and I felt it only fair that you should be informed about this . If there is something I should know , I would prefer to hear it from you . Any scandal involving one of our professors would reflect badly on the university . " She shook her head helplessly . " I  --  I really ca n't think of anything . " He looked at her a moment , as though about to say something else , then nodded . " So be it , Mrs. Ashley . " She watched him walk out of her office and wondered : What in God 's name could I have done ? Mary was very quiet during dinner . She wanted to wait until Edward finished eating before she broke the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figure out the problem together . The children were being impossible again . Beth refused to touch her dinner . " No one eats meat anymore . It 's a barbaric custom carried over from the caveman . Civilized people do n't eat live animals . " " It 's not alive , " Tim argued . " It 's dead , so you might as well eat it . " " Children ! " Mary 's nerves were on edge . " Not another word . Beth , go make yourself a salad . "  | " She could go graze in the field , " Tim offered . " Tim ! You finish your dinner . " Her head was beginning to pound . " Edward ? " The telephone rang . " That 's for me , " Beth said . She leaped out of her chair and raced toward the telephone . She picked it up and said seductively , " Virgil ? " She listened a moment , and her expression changed . " Oh , sure , " she said disgustedly . She slammed down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was that all about ? " Edward asked . " Some practical joker . He said it was the White House calling Mom . " " The White House ? " Edward asked . The telephone rang again . " I 'll get it , " Mary said . She rose and walked over to the telephone . " Hello . " As she listened , her face grew grim . " We 're in the middle of dinner , and I do n't happen to think this is funny . You can just  --  what ? . . . Who ? The President ? " There was a sudden hush in the room . " Wait a  --  I ? oh , good evening , Mr. President . " There was a dazed expression on her face . Her family was watching her , wide-eyed . " Yes , sir . I do . I recognize your voice . I  --  I 'm sorry about hanging up a moment ago . Beth thought it was Virgil , and  --  yes , sir . Thank you . " She stood there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what ? " Her face suddenly flushed . Edward was on his feet , moving toward the phone , the children close behind him . " There must be some mistake , Mr. President . My name is Mary Ashley . I 'm a professor at Kansas State University , and ? You read it ? Thank you , sir . . . . That 's very kind of you . . . . Yes , I believe it is . . . . " She listened for a long time . " Yes , sir , I agree . But that does n't mean that I . . . Yes , sir . Yes , sir . I see . Well , I 'm certainly flattered . I 'm sure it 's a wonderful opportunity , but I . . . Of course I will .  | I 'll talk it over with my husband and get back to you . " She picked up a pen and wrote down a number . " Yes , sir . I have it . Thank you , Mr. President . Good-bye . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shock . " What in God 's name was that all about ? " Edward demanded . " Was that really the President ? " Tim asked . Mary sank into a chair . " Yes . It really was . " Edward took Mary 's hand in his . " Mary  --  what did he say ? What did he want ? " Mary sat there , numb , thinking : So that 's what all the questioning has been about . She looked up at Edward and the children and said slowly , " The President read my book and the article of mine in Foreign Affairs magazine , and he thought it was brilliant . He said that 's the kind of thinking he wants for his people-topeople program . He wants to nominate me as ambassador to Romania . " There was a look of total disbelief on Edward 's face . " You ? Why you ? " It was exactly what Mary had asked herself , but she felt that Edward could have been more tactful . He could have said , " How wonderful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was being realistic . Why me , indeed ? " You have n't had any political experience . " " I 'm well aware of that , " Mary responded tartly . " I agree that the whole thing is ridiculous . " " Are you going to be the ambassador ? " Tim asked . " Are we moving to Rome ? " " Romania . " " Where 's Romania ? " Edward turned to the children . " You two finish your dinner . Your mother and I would like to have a little talk . " " Do n't we get a vote ? " Tim asked . By absentee ballot . "  | Edward took Mary 's arm and led her into the library . He turned to her and said , " I 'm sorry if I sounded like a pompous ass in there . It was just such a ? " " No . You were perfectly right , Edward . Why on earth should they have chosen me ? " When Mary called him Edward , he knew he was in trouble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ambassador , or ambassadress , or whatever they call it these days . But you must admit it came as a bit of a shock . " Mary softened . " Try thunderbolt . " She sounded like a little girl . " I still ca n't believe it . " She laughed . " Wait until I tell Florence . She 'll die . " Edward was watching her closely . " You 're really excited about this , are n't you ? " She looked at him in surprise . " Of course I am . Would n't you be ? " Edward chose his words carefully . " It is a great honor , honey , and I 'm sure it 's not one they would offer lightly . They must have had good reason for choosing you . " He hesitated . " We have to think about this very carefully . About what it would do to our lives . " She knew what he was going to say , and she thought : Edward 's right . Of course he 's right . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my patients . I have to stay here . I do n't know how long you 'd have to be away , but if it really means a lot to you , well , maybe we could work out some way where you could go over there with the children and I could join you when-ever ? " Mary said softly , " You crazy man . Do you think I could live away from you ? " " Well  --  it 's an awfully big honor , and ? " " So is being your wife . Nothing means as much to me as you and the children . I would never leave you . This town ca n't find another doctor like you , but all the government  | has to do to find a better ambassador than me is to look in the Yellow Pages . " He took her in his arms . " Are you sure ? " " I 'm positive . It was exciting being asked . That 's enough for ? " The door flew open and Beth and Tim hurried in . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him you 're going to be an ambassador . " " Then you 'd better call him back and tell him I 'm not . " " Why not ? " Beth asked . " Your mother has decided she 's going to stay here . " " Why ? " Beth wailed . " I 've never been to Romania . I 've never been anywhere . " " Me neither , " Tim said . He turned to Beth . " I told you we 're never going to escape from this place . " " The subject is closed , " Mary informed them . The following morning Mary dialed the telephone number that the President had given her . When an operator answered , Mary said , " This is Mrs. Edward Ashley . I think the President 's assistant  --  a Mr. Greene  --  is expecting my call . " " One moment , please . " A male voice on the other end said , " Hello . Mrs. Ash-ley ? " " Yes , " Mary said . " Would you please give the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Would you please tell him that I 'm very , very flattered by his offer , but my husband 's profession ties him down here , o I 'm afraid it would be impossible for me to accept . I hope he understands . " " I ' 11 pass on your message , " the voice said noncommittally . " Thank you , Mrs. Ashley . " The line went dead . Mary slowly replaced the receiver . It was done . For one brief moment , a tantalizing dream had been offered her . But  | that was all it was . A dream . This is my real world . I 'd better get ready for my next political science class . Manama , Bahrain The whitewashed stone house was anonymous , hidden among dozens of identical houses a short walk from the souks , the large , colorful outdoor markets . It was owned by a merchant sympathetic to the cause of the organization known as the Patriots for Freedom .

" The motion that was recently passed has run into difficulty . " " What sort of difficulty ? " Balder asked . " The go-between we selected  --  Harry Lantz  --  is dead . " " Dead ? Dead , how ? " " He was murdered . His body was found floating in the harbor in Buenos Aires . " " Do the police have any idea who did it ? I mean  --  can they connect this to us in any way ? " " No . We 're perfectly safe . " Thor asked , " What about our plan ? Can we go ahead with it ? " " Not at the moment . We have no idea how to reach Angel . However , the Controller gave Harry Lantz permission to reveal his name to him . If Angel is interested in our proposition , he will find a way to get in touch with him . All we can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Junction City Daily Union read : JUNCTION CITY 'S MARY ASHLEY DECLINES AMBASSADORSHIP . There was a two-column story about Mary , and a photo-  | graph of her . On KJCK , the afternoon and evening broadcasts carried feature stories on the town 's new celebrity . The fact that Mary Ashley had rejected the President 's offer made the story even bigger than if she had accepted it . In the eyes of its proud citizens , Junction City , Kansas , was a lot more important than Bucharest , Romania . When Mary Ashley drove into town to shop for dinner , she kept hearing her name on the car radio . " . . . Earlier , President Ellison had announced that the ambassadorship to Romania would be the beginning of his people-to-people program , the cornerstone of his foreign policy . How Mary Ashley 's refusal to accept the post will reflect on ? " She switched to another station . . . is married to Dr. Edward Ashley , and it is believed that ? " Mary switched off the radio . She had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends , neighbors , students , and curious strangers . Reporters had called from as far away as London and Tokyo . They 're building this up all out of proportion , Mary thought . It 's not my fault that the President decided to base the success of his foreign policy on Romania . I wonder how long this pandemonium is going to last . It will probably be over in a day or two . She drove the station wagon into a Derby gas station and pulled up in front of the self-service pump . As Mary got out of the car , Mr. Blount , the station manager , hurried over to her . " Mornin ' , Mrs. Ashley . An ambassador lady ai n't got no call to be pumpin ' her own gas . Let me give you a hand . " Mary smiled . " Thanks . I 'm used to doing it . " " No , no . I insist . " When the tank was filled , Mary drove down Washington Street and parked in front of the Shoe Box . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greeted her . " How 's the ambassador this mornin ' ? "  | This is going to get tiresome , Mary thought . Aloud , she said , " I 'm not an ambassador , but I 'm fine , thank you . " She handed him a pair of shoes . " I 'd like to have Tim 's shoes resoled . " The clerk examined them . " Ai n't these the ones we did last week ? " Mary sighed . " And the week before . " Mary 's next stop was at Long 's Department Store . Mrs. Hacker , the manager of the dress department , said to her , " I jest heard your name on the radio . You 're puttin ' Junction City on the map . Yes , sir . I guess you and Eisenhower and Alf Landon are Kansas 's only political big shots , Mrs. Ambassador . " " I 'm not an ambassador , " Mary said patiently . " I turned it down . " " That 's what I mean . " It was no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Beth . Preferably something in iron . " " How old is Beth now ? About ten ? " " She 's twelve . " " Land 's sake , they grow so fast these days , do n't they ? She 'll be a teenager before you know it . " " Beth was born a teenager , Mrs. Hacker . " " How 's Tim ? " " He 's a lot like Beth . " The shopping took Mary twice as long as usual . Everyone had some comment to make about the big news . She went into Dillon 's to buy some groceries , and was studying the shelves when Mrs. Dillon approached . " Mornin ' , Mrs. Ashley . " " Good morning , Mrs. Dillon . Do you have a breakfast food that has nothing in it ? " " What ? " Mary consulted a list in her hand . " No artificial sweet-  | eners , no sodium , fats , carbohydrates , caffeine , caramel coloring , folic acid , or flavorites . " Mrs. Dillon studied the paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " In a sense . It 's for Beth . She 'll only eat natural foods . " " Why do n't you just put her out to pasture and let her graze ? " Mary laughed . " That 's what my son suggested . " Mary picked up a package and studied the label . " It 's my fault . I never should have taught Beth how to read . " Mary drove home carefully , climbing the winding hill toward Milford Lake . It was a few degrees above zero , but the windchill factor brought the temperature down to well below zero , for there was nothing to stop the winds from their biting sweep across the endless plains . The lawns were covered with snow , and Mary remembered the previous winter when an ice storm had swept the county and the ice snapped the power lines . They had no electricity for almost a week . She and Edward made love every night . Maybe we 'll get lucky again this winter , she grinned to herself . When Mary arrived home , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the study watching a science-fiction program . Mary put away the groceries and went in to confront her son . " Are n't you supposed to be doing your homework ? " " I ca n't . " " And why not ? " " Because I do n't understand it . " " You 're not going to understand it any better by watching Star Trek . Let me see your lesson . " Tim showed her his fifth-grade mathematics book . " These are dumb problems , " Tim said . " " There are no such things as dumb problems . There are only dumb students . Now let 's take a look at this . "  | Mary read the problem aloud . " A train leaving Minneapolis had one hundred and forty-nine people on board . In Atlanta more people boarded the train . Then there were two hundred and twenty-three on the train . How many people boarded in Atlanta ? " She looked up . " That 's simple , Tim . You just subtract one hundred forty-nine from two hundred twenty-three . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glumly . " It has to be an equation . One hundred forty-nine plus N equals two hundred twenty-three . N equals two hundred twenty-three minus one hundred forty-nine . N equals seventy-four . " " That 's dumb , " Mary said . As Mary passed Beth 's room , she heard noises . Mary went in . Beth was seated on the floor , cross-legged , watching television , listening to a rock record , and doing her homework . " How can you concentrate with all this noise ? " Mary shouted . She walked over to the television set and turned it off and then turned off the record player . Beth looked up in surprise . " What did you do that for ? That was George Michael . " Beth 's room was wallpapered with posters of musicians . There were Kiss and Van Halen , Motley Crue and Aldo Nova and David Lee Roth . The bed was covered with magazines : Seventeen and Teen Idol and half a dozen others . Beth 's clothes were scattered over the floor . Mary looked around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can you live like this ? " Beth looked up at her mother , puzzled . " Live like what ? " Mary gritted her teeth . " Nothing . " She looked at an envelope on her daughter 's desk . " You 're writing to Rick Springfield ? " " I 'm in love with him . " " I thought you were in love with George Michael . "  | " I burn for George Michael . I 'm in love with Rick Springfield . Mother , in your day did n't you ever burn for any-body ? " " In my day we were too busy trying to get the covered wagons across the country . " Beth sighed . " Did you know Rick Springfield had a rotten childhood ? " " To be perfectly honest , Beth , I was not aware of that . " " It was awful . His father was in the military and they moved around a lot . He 's a vegetarian too . Like me . He 's awesome . " So that 's what 's behind Beth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a movie Saturday night with Vir-gil ? " " Virgil ? What happened to Arnold ? " There was a pause . " Arnold wanted to fool around . He 's dorky . " Mary forced herself to sound calm . " By fooling around , ' you mean ? ? " " Just because I 'm starting to get breasts the boys think I 'm easy . Mom , did you ever feel uncomfortable about your body ? " Mary moved up behind Beth and put her arms around her . " Yes , my darling . When I was about your age , I felt very uncomfortable . " " I hate having my period and getting breasts and hair all over . Why ? " " It happens to every girl , and you 'll get used to it . " " No , I wo n't . " She pulled away and said fiercely , " I do n't mind being in love , but I 'm never going to have sex . No one 's going to make me . Not Arnold or Virgil or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if that 's your decision . . . " " Definitely . Mom , what did President Ellison say when you told him you were n't going to be his ambassador ? "  | " He was very brave about it , " Mary assured her . " I think I 'd better get dinner started . " Cooking was Mary Ashley 's secret bete noir . She hated to cook , and consequently was not very good at it , and because she liked to be good at everything she did , she hated it even more . It was a vicious circle that had partly been solved by having Lucinda come in three times a week to cook and clean the house . This was one of Lucinda 's days off . When Edward came home from the hospital , Mary was in the kitchen , burning some peas . She turned off the stove and gave Edward a kiss . " Hello , darling . How was your day ? Dorky ? " " You 've been communicating with our daughter , " Edward said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I treated a thirteen-year-old girl this afternoon who had genital herpes . " " Oh , darling ! " She threw out the peas and opened a can of tomatoes . " You know , it makes me worry about Beth . " " You do n't have to , " Mary assured him . " She 's planning to die a virgin . " At dinner Tim asked , " Dad , can I have a surfboard for my birthday ? " " Tim  --  I do n't want to rain on your parade , but you happen to live in Kansas . " " I know that . Johnny invited me to go to Hawaii with him next summer . His folks have a beach house in Maui . " " Well , " Edward said reasonably , " if Johnny has a beach house , then he probably has a surfboard . " Tim turned to his mother . " Can I go ? " " We 'll see . Please do n't eat so fast , Tim . Beth , you 're not eating anything . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consumption . "  | She looked at her parents . " I have an announcement to make . I 'm going to change my name . " Edward asked carefully , " Any particular reason ? " " I 've decided to go into show business . " Mary and Edward exchanged a long , pained look . Edward said , " Okay . Find out how much you can get for them . "  |  | In 1965 , in a scandal that rocked the international secretservice organizations , Mehdi ben Barka , an opponent of King Hassan II of Morocco , was lured to Paris from his exile in ( ieneva and murdered with the help of the French secret service . It was following this incident that President Charles de Gaulle took the secret service from the control of the premier 's office and placed it under the aegis of the Ministry of Defense . Thus it was that the current minister of defense , koland Passy , was responsible for the safety of Malin Groza , who had been granted sanctuary by the French government . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on twenty-four-hour shifts , but it was the knowledge that Lev Pasternak was in charge of the villa 's inner security that gave Passy confidence . He had seen the security arrangements himself and was firmly convinced that the house was impregnable . In recent weeks , rumors had been sweeping the diplomatic world that a coup was imminent , that Malin Groza was plan-  | ning to return to Romania , and that Alexandros Ionescu was going to be deposed by his senior military officers . Lev Pasternak knocked on the door and entered the bookcrammed library that served as Marin Groza 's office . Groza was seated behind his desk , working . He looked up as Lev Pasternak came in . " Everybody wants to know when the revolution is going to happen , " Pasternak said . " It 's the world 's worst-kept secret . " " Tell them to be patient . Will you come to Bucharest with me , Lev ? " More than anything , Lev Pasternak yearned to return to Israel . I 'll only take this job temporarily , he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your move . Temporarily had turned into weeks and months , and finally into three years . And now it was time to make another decision . In a world peopled with pygmies , Lev Pasternak thought , I have been given the privilege of serving a giant . Marin Groza was the most selfless and idealistic man Lev Pasternak had ever known . When Pasternak had come to work for Groza , he had wondered about the man 's family . Groza would never speak of them , but the officer who had arranged for Pasternak to meet Groza told him the story . " Groza was betrayed . The Securitate picked him up and tortured him for five days . They promised to free him if he would give them the names of his associates in the underground . He would n't talk . They arrested his wife and his fourteen-year-old daughter and brought them to the interrogation room . Groza was given a choice : Talk or watch them die . It was the hardest decision any man ever had to make . It was the lives of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of people who believed in him . " The man paused , then went on more slowly . " I think in the end what made Groza decide the way he did was that he was convinced that  | he and his family were going to be killed anyway . He refused to give them the names . The guards strapped him in a chair and forced him to watch his wife and daughter being gangraped until they died . But they were n't through with Groza yet . When it was over and their bloody bodies were lying at his feet . they castrated him . " " Oh , my God ! " The officer looked into Lev Pasternak 's eyes and said , " The most important thing for you to understand is that Marin Groza does not want to return to Romania to seek vengeance . He wants to go back to free his people . He wants to make certain that such things can never again happen . " Lev Pasternak had been with Groza from that day on , and the more time he spent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . Now , he would have to decide whether to give up his return to Israel and go to Romania with Groza . Pasternak was walking down the hallway that evening , and as he passed Marin Groza 's bedroom door , he heard the familiar screams of pain ring out . So it 's Friday , Pasternak thought . The day the prostitutes came . They were selected from England , North America , Brazil , Japan , Thailand , and half a dozen other countries , chosen at random . They had no idea what their destination was , or who they were going to see . They were met at Charles de Gaulle Airport , driven directly to the villa , and , after a few hours , taken back to the airport and put on a return flight . Every Friday night the halls resounded with Marin Groza 's screams . The staff assumed that kinky sex was going on . The only one who knew what was really happening behind the bedroom door was Lev Pasternak . For the visits with the prostitutes had nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Once a week Groza stripped himself naked and had a woman tie him to a chair and whip him mercilessly , until his blood flowed , and each time he was whipped he would see his wife and daughter  | being raped to death , screaming for help . And he would cry out , " I 'm sorry ! I 'll talk . Oh , God , please let me talk . . . " The telephone call came ten days after Harry Lantz 's body was found . The Controller was in the middle of a staff meeting in the conference room when the intercom buzzer sounded . " I know you asked not to be disturbed , sir , but there 's an overseas call for you . It sounds urgent . A Miss Neusa Munez is calling from Buenos Aires . I told her ? " " It 's all right . " He kept his emotions under tight control . " I 'll take the call in my private office . " He excused himself , went into his office , and locked the door . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this Miss Munez ? " " Yeah . " It was a voice with a South American accent , coarse and uneducated . " I got a message for you from Angel . He din ' like the nosy messenger you sent . " He had to choose his words carefully . " I 'm sorry . But we would still like Angel to go ahead with our arrangement . Would that be possible ? " " Yeah . He say he wan na do it . " The man held back a sigh of relief . " Excellent . How shall I arrange his advance ? " The woman laughed . " Angel , he don ' need no advance . Nobody cheats Angel . " Somehow the words were chilling . " When the job is finished , he say you put the money in ? wait a minute  --  I got it wrote down  --  here it is  --  the State Bank in Zurich . Thas someplace in Switzerland .

I 'm going to give you my private telephone number in case Angel needs to reach me . " He gave it to her slowly .

In the eyes of her students she had become a celebrity . It was a heady feeling . She could feel the class hanging on her words . As we know , 1956 was a watershed year for many of the I.lastern European countries . With Gomulka 's return to power , national communism emerged in Poland . In Czechoslovakia Antonin Mavorony led the Communist party . There were no major political changes in Romania that year . . . " Romania . . . Bucharest . . . From the photographs Mary had seen , it had to be one of the most beautiful cities in I.tirope . She had not forgotten any of the stories her grandfather had told her about Romania . She remembered how terrified she had been as a little girl by his tales of the horihle Prince Vlad of Transylvania . He was a vampire , Mary ,  | living in his huge castle high in the mountains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mary was suddenly aware of a deep silence in the room . The class was staring at her . How long have I been standing here daydreaming ? she wondered . She hurriedly continued her lecture . " In Romania , Gheorghiu-Dej was consolidating his power in the Workers ' Party . . . " The class seemed to go on endlessly , but mercifully it was almost over . " Your homework assignment will be to write an essay on the USSR 's economic planning and management , describing the basic organization of the government organs , and the CPSU control . I want you to analyze the internal and external dimensions of Soviet policy , with emphasis on its positions on Poland , Czechoslovakia , and Romania . " Romania . . . Welcome to Romania , Madam Ambassador . Your limousine is here to drive you to your embassy . Her embassy .

I could have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her reverie by the sound of the bell . Class was over . Time to go home and change . Edward would be back from the hospital early . He was taking her out to the country club for dinner . As befitted an almost-ambassador . " Code Blue ! Code Blue ! " the crackling voice sounded over the loudspeaker throughout the hospital corridors . Even as the emergency crew began to converge on the ambulance entrance , the sound of an approaching siren could be heard . The Geary Community Hospital is an austere-looking threestory brown building perched on a hill on St. Mary 's Road in the southwest section of Junction City . The hospital holds sixty-six beds , and has two modern operating rooms and a series of examining rooms and administrative offices .  | It had been an unusually busy Friday , and the ward on the top floor was already filled with injured servicemen who had come to town from nearby Fort Riley , home of the 1st Infantry Division , known as The Big Red One , for their weekend R and R.

Edward Ashley had been a doctor at Geary Memorial Hospital for thirteen years , and before going into private practice he had been an air force flight surgeon with the rank of captain . Several prestigious hospitals in large cities had tried to lure him away , but he preferred to stay where he was . He finished with the patient he was working on and looked around . There were at least a dozen soldiers waiting to be patched up . He heard the sound of the approaching ambulance siren . " They 're playing our song . " Dr. Douglas Schiffer , who was tending a gunshot-wound victim , nodded . " It looks like M*A*S*H in here . You 'd think we were in some kind of war . " Edward Ashley said , " It 's the only war they have , Doug . That 's why they come into town every weekend and go a little nuts . They 're frustrated . " He finished the last stitch . " ' There you are , soldier . You 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Schiffer . " We 'd better get down to emergency . " The patient wore the uniform of a private , and he looked to he no more than eighteen years old . He was in shock . He was sweating profusely and his breathing was labored . Dr. Ashley felt his pulse . It was weak and thready . A splotch of blood stained the front of his uniform jacket . Edward Ashley turned to one of the paramedics who had brought in the patient . " What do we have here ? " " A knife wound to the chest , Doctor . " " Let 's see if his lung is collapsed . " He turned to a nurse . " I want a stat chest X ray . You 've got three minutes . "  | Dr. Douglas Schiffer was observing the jugular vein . It was raised . He looked over at Edward . " It 's distended . The pericardium 's probably been penetrated . " Which meant that the sac that protected the heart was filled with blood , pressing against the heart so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was taking the patient 's blood pressure said , " Blood pressure 's dropping fast . " The monitor measuring the patient 's electrocardiogram began to slow . They were losing the patient . Another nurse hurried in with the chest X ray . Edward scanned it . " Pericardial tamponade . " The heart had a hole in it . The lung was collapsed . " Get a tube in him and expand the lung . " His voice was quiet , but there was no mistaking the urgency in it . " Get an anesthesiologist . We 're going to open him up . Intubate him . " A nurse handed Dr. Schiffer an endotracheal tube . Edward Ashley nodded at him . " Now . " Douglas Schiffer carefully began to push the tube into the unconscious soldier 's windpipe . There was a bag at the end of the tube , and Schiffer began to squeeze it in a steady rhythm , ventilating the lungs . The monitor began to slow , and the curve on the monitor was completely flat . The smell of death was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was no time to wheel the patient up to the operating room . Dr. Ashley had to make an instant decision . " We 're going to do a thoracotomy . Scalpel . " The instant the knife was in his hand , Edward reached down and slashed it across the patient 's chest . There was almost no blood , because the heart was trapped in the pericardium . " Retractor ! " The instrument was put in his hands , and he inserted it into the patient 's chest to spread the ribs apart . " Scissors . Stand back ! " He moved closer so that he could reach the pericardial  | sac . He snipped the scissors into it , and the blood released from the imprisonment of the heart sac spurted out , hitting the nurses and Dr. Ashley . Dr. Ashley reached in and began to massage the heart . The monitor began to beep , and the pulse became palpable . There was a small laceration at the apex of the left ventricle . " Get him up to the operating room . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table . " Transfusion  --  a thousand cc 's . " There was no time to match blood type , so 0 negative ? the universal donor  --  was used . As the blood transfusion began , Dr. Ashley said , " A thirtytwo chest tube . " A nurse handed it to him . Dr. Schiffer said , " I 'll close , Ed . Why do n't you get cleaned up ? " Edward Ashley 's surgical gown was stained with blood . He looked at the monitor . The heart was strong and steady . " Thanks . " Edward Ashley had showered and changed clothes and was in his office writing up the required medical report . It was a pleasant office , filled with bookcases containing medical tomes and athletic trophies . It contained a desk , an easy chair , and a small table with two straight chairs . On the walls were his diplomas , neatly framed . Edward 's body felt stiff and tired from the tension he had just gone through . At the same time , he felt sexually aroused , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming face-tolace with death that magnifies the values of the life force , a psychiatrist had once explained to Edward . Making love is the affirmation of nature 's continuum . Whatever the reason , Edward thought , I wish Mary were here . Ile selected a pipe from the pipe rack on his desk , lighted it , and sank into the easy chair and stretched out his legs . Thinking about Mary made him feel guilty . He was respon-  | sible for her turning down the President 's offer , and his reasons were valid . But there 's more to it than that , Edward admitted to himself . I was jealous . I reacted like a spoiled brat . What would have happened if the President had made me an offer like that ? I 'd probably have jumped at it . Jesus ! All I could think of was that I wanted Mary to stay home and take care of me and the kids . Talk about your genuine male chauvinist pig ! He sat there , smoking his pipe , upset with himself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it up to her . I 'll surprise her this summer with a trip to Paris and London . Maybe I 'll take her to Romania . We 'll have a real honeymoon . The Junction City Country Club is a three-level limestone building set in the midst of lush hills . The club has an eighteen-hole golf course , two tennis courts , a swimming pool , a bar and dining room with a large fireplace at one end , a card room upstairs , and locker rooms downstairs . Edward 's father had belonged to the club , as had Mary 's father , and Edward and Mary had been taken there since they were children . The town was a closely knit community , and the country club was its symbol . When Edward and Mary arrived , it was late , and there was only a sprinkling of guests left in the dining room . They stared , watching as Mary sat down , and whispered to one another . Mary was getting used to it . Edward looked at his wife . " Any regrets ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ castles-in-Spain regrets about the kind of glamorous , impossible dreams that everyone has . If I had been born a princess ; if I were a millionnairess ; if I received the Nobel Prize for curing cancer ; if . .. if . . . if . . . Mary smiled . " None , darling . It was a fluke that they even asked me . Anyhow , there 's no way I would ever leave you or the children . " She took his hand in hers . " No regrets . I 'm glad I refused the offer . "  | He leaned across to her and whispered , " I 'm going to make you an offer you ca n't refuse . " " Let 's go . " Mary smiled . with time , but the emotions were still there , constant and sweet and fulfilling . When they returned home now , they undressed without haste and got into bed . Edward held her close to him , then began to stroke her body gently , playing with her breasts , teasing the nipples with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ softness . Mary moaned with pleasure . " That feels wonderful . " She moved on top of him and began flicking her tongue down his body , feeling him become hard . When they were both ready , they made love until they were exhausted . Edward held his wife tightly in his arms . " I love you so much , Mary . " " I love you twice as much . Good night , darling . " At three o'clock in the morning , the phone exploded into sound . Edward sleepily reached for the instrument and brought it to his ear . " Hello . . . " A woman 's urgent voice said , " Dr. Ashley ? " " Yes . . . " " Pete Grimes is havin ' a heart attack . He 's in pain somethin ' awful . I think he 's dyin ' . I do n't know what to do . " Edward sat up in bed , trying to blink the sleep away . " Do n't do anything . Keep him still . I 'll be there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ receiver , slid out of bed , and started to dress . " Edward . . . " lie looked over at Mary . Her eyes were half open . " What 's wrong ? " In the beginning , when they were first married , their lovemaking had been fierce and demanding . They had a constant physical need for each other that could not be satisfied until they were both completely spent . The urgency had mellowed  | " Everything 's fine . Go back to sleep . " " Wake me up when you come back , " Mary mumbled . " I think I 'm going to feel sexy again . " Edward grinned . " I 'll hurry . " Five minutes later , he was on his way to the Grimes farm . He drove down the hill on Old Milford Road toward J Hill Road . It was a cold and raw morning , with a northwesterly wind driving the temperature well below zero . Edward turned up the car heater . As he drove , he wondered whether he should have called for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two " heart attacks " Pete Grimes had had turned out to be bleeding ulcers . No . He would check it out first . He turned the car onto Route 18 , the two-lane highway that went through Junction City . The town was asleep , its houses huddled against the bitter , frigid wind . When Edward came to the end of Sixth Street , he made the turn that took him onto Route 57 and headed toward Grandview Plaza . How many times had he driven over these roads on hot summer days with the sweet smell of corn and prairie hay in the air , past miniature forests of cottonwood trees and cedars and Russian olive trees , and August haystacks piled up alongside the roads ? The fields had been filled then with the odor of burning cedar trees that had to be destroyed regularly because they kept taking over the crops . And how many winters had he driven on this road through a frosted landscape , with power lines delicately laced with ice , and lonely smoke from far-off chimneys ? There was an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ darkness , watching fields and trees fly silently past . Edward drove as fast as possible , mindful of the treacherous road beneath the wheels . He thought of Mary lying in their warm bed , waiting for him . Wake me up when you come back . I think I 'm going to feel sexy again . He was so lucky . I 'll make everything up to her , Edward promised himself . I 'll give her the damnedest honeymoon any woman ever had .  | Ahead , at the intersection of highways 57 and 77 , was a stop sign . Edward turned at Route 77 , and as he started into the intersection , a truck appeared out of nowhere . He heard a sudden roar , and his car was pinned by two bright headlights racing toward him . He caught a glimpse of the giant five-ton army truck bearing down on him , and the last sound he heard was his own voice screaming . In Neuilly church bells pealed out across the quiet noon air . The gendarmes guarding Marin Groza 's villa had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cruising by . Angel drove slowly , but not slowly enough to arouse suspicion , taking everything in . Two guards in front , a high wall , probably electrified , and inside , of course , the usual electronic nonsense of beams , sensors , and alarms . It would take an army to storm the villa . But I do n't need an army , Angel thought . Only my genius . Marin Groza is a dead man . If only my mother were alive to see how rich I have become . How happy it would have made her . In Argentina , poor families were very poor , indeed , and Angel 's mother had been one of the unfortunate descamisados . No one knew or cared who the father had been . Through the years Angel had watched friends and relatives die of hunger and sickness and disease . Death was a way of life , and Angel thought philosophically : Since it is going to happen anyway , why not make a profit from it ? In the beginning , there were those who doubted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put roadblocks in the way had a habit of disappearing . Angel 's reputation as an assassin grew . I have never jailed , Angel thought . I am Angel . The Angel of Death .  |  | The snow-covered Kansas highway was ab Iles with flashing red lights that turned the fr red . A fire truck , ambulance , tow truck , four cars , a sheriff 's car , and in the center , ringed the five-ton M871 army tractor-trailer , and pa it , Edward Ashley 's crumpled car . A dozen and firemen were milling around , swinging 1 stamping their feet , trying to keep warm in the I n the middle of the highway , covered by a L body . A sheriff 's car was approaching , and a a stop , Mary Ashley ran out of it . She was tre that she could barely stand . She saw the tarpal toward it . Sheriff Munster grabbed her arm . " I would It I were you , Mrs. Ashley . " " Let go of me ! " She was screaming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | " Please , Mrs. Ashley . You do n't want to see what he looks like . " He caught her as she fainted . She woke up in the backseat of the sheriff 's car . Sheriff Munster was sitting in the front seat , watching her . The heater was on , and the car was stifling . " What happened ? " Mary asked dully . " You fainted . " She suddenly remembered . You do n't want to see what he looks like . Mary stared out the window at all the emergency vehicles and flashing red lights and thought : It 's a scene from hell . In spite of the heat in the police car , her teeth were chattering . " How did ? " She found it difficult to get the words out . " How did it h-happen ? " " He ran the stop sign . An army truck was comin ' along Seventy-seven and tried to avoid him , but your husband drove right out in front of him . " She closed her eyes and watched the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bearing down on Edward and felt his last-second panic . All she could think of to say was , " Edward was a c-careful driver . He would n-never go through a stop sign . " The sheriff said sympathetically , " Mrs. Ashley , we have eyewitnesses . A priest and two nuns saw it happen , and a Colonel Jenkins from Fort Riley . They all said the same thing . Your husband ran the stop sign . " Everything after that seemed to happen in slow motion . She watched Edward 's body being lifted into the ambulance . Police were questioning a priest and two nuns , and Mary thought : They 're going to catch cold standing out there like that . Sheriff Munster said , " They 're takin ' the body to the morgue . "  | The body . " Thank you , " Mary said politely . He was looking at her strangely . " I 'd best get you back home , " he said . " What 's the name of your family doctor ? " " Edward Ashley , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctor . " Later , she remembered walking up to the house and Sheriff Munster leading her inside . Florence and Douglas Schiffer were waiting for her in the living room . The children were still asleep . Florence threw her arms around her . " Oh , darling , I 'm so terribly , terribly sorry . " " It 's all right , " Mary said calmly . " Edward had an accident . " She giggled . Douglas was watching her closely . " Let me take you upstairs . " " I 'm fine , thank you . Would you care for some tea ? " Douglas said , " Come on , I 'm putting you to bed . " " I 'm not sleepy . Are you sure you would n't care for something ? " As Douglas led her upstairs into the bedroom , Mary said to him , " It was an accident . Edward was in an accident . " Douglas Schiffer looked into her eyes . They were wide and vacant . He felt a chill go through him . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returned , Mary had not moved . " I 'm going to give you something to make you sleep . " He gave her a sedative , helped her into bed , and sat at her side . An hour later , Mary was still awake . He gave her another sedative . Then a third . Finally , she slept . In Junction City there are strict investigative procedures involved in the report of a 1048 ? an injury accident . An ambulance is dispatched from the County Ambulance Service , and a sheriff 's officer is sent to the scene . If army personnel  | are involved in the accident , the CID  --  the Criminal Investigating Division of the army  --  conducts an investigation along with the sheriff 's office . Shel Planchard , a plainclothes officer from the CID headquarters at Fort Riley , and the sheriff and a deputy were examining the accident report in the sheriff 's office on Ninth Street . " It beats me , " Sheriff Munster said . " What 's the problem , Sheriff ? " Planchard asked . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the accident , right ? A priest and two nuns , Colonel Jenkins , and the truck driver , Sergeant Wallis . Every single one of them says Doc Ashley 's car turned onto the highway , ran the stop sign , and was hit by the army truck . " " Right , " the CID man said . " What 's bothering you ? " Sheriff Munster scratched his head . " Mister , have you ever seen an accident report where even two eyewitnesses said the same thing ? " He slammed a fist against the papers . " What bothers the hell out of me is that every one of these witnesses says exactly the same thing . " The CID man shrugged . " It just shows that what happened was pretty obvious . " The sheriff said , " There 's somethin ' else nigglin ' at me . " " Yeah ? " " What were a priest and two nuns and a colonel doing out on Highway Seventy-seven at four o'clock in the mornin ' ? " " Nothing mysterious about that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leonardville , and the colonel was returning to Fort Riley . " The sheriff said , " I checked with the DMV . The last ticket Doc Ashley got was six years ago for illegal parking . He had no accident record . " The CID man was studying him . " Sheriff , just what are you suggesting ? " Munster shrugged . " I 'm not suggestin ' anythin ' . I jest have a funny feelin ' about this . "  | " We 're talking about an accident seen by five witnesses . If you think there 's some kind of conspiracy involved , there 's a big hole in your theory . If ? " The sheriff sighed . " I know . If it was n't an accident , all the army truck had to do was knock him off and keep goin ' . There would n't be any reason for all these witnesses and rigamarole . " " Exactly . " The CID man rose and stretched . " Well , I 've got to get back to the base . As far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Sergeant Wallis , is cleared . " He looked at the sheriff . " Are we in agreement ? " Sheriff Munster said reluctantly , " Yeah . It musta been an accident . " Mary was awakened by the sound of the children crying . She lay still , her eyes tightly closed , thinking : This is a part of my nightmare . I 'm asleep , and when I wake up , Edward - , ' ill be alive . But the crying continued . When she could stand it no longer , she opened her eyes and lay there , staring at the ceiling . Finally , reluctantly , she forced herself to get out of bed . She felt drugged . She walked into Tim 's bedroom . Florence and Beth were there with him . The three of them were crying . I wish I could cry , Mary thought . Oh , I wish I could cry . Beth looked up at Mary . " Is  --  is Daddy really d-dead ? " Mary nodded , unable to speak the words . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to tell them , " Florence apologized . " They were going to go off to play with some friends . " " It 's all right . " Mary stroked Tim 's hair . " Do n't cry , darling . Everything is going to be all right . " Nothing was going to be all right again . Ever . The United States Army CID Command at Fort Riley is headquartered at Building 169 , in an old limestone structure  | surrounded by trees , with steps leading up to the porch of the building . In an office on the first floor , Shel Planchard , the CID officer , was talking to Colonel Jenkins . " I 'm afraid I have some bad news , sir . Sergeant Wallis , the driver of the truck that killed the civilian doctor ? " " Yes ? " " He had a fatal heart attack this morning . " " That 's a shame . " The CID man said tonelessly , " Yes , sir . His body is being cremated this morning . It was very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I 'm being transferred overseas . " He allowed himself a small smile . " A rather important promotion . " " Congratulations , sir . You 've earned it . " Mary Ashley decided later that the only thing that saved her sanity was being in a state of shock . Everything that happened seemed to be happening to someone else . She was underwater , moving slowly , hearing voices from a distance , filtered through cotton wool . The funeral service was held at the Mass-Hinitt-Alexander Funeral Home on Jefferson Street . It was a blue building with a white portico and a large white clock hanging above the entrance . The funeral parlor was filled to overflowing with friends and colleagues of Edward . There were dozens of wreaths and bouquets . One of the largest wreaths had a card that read , simply : " My deepest sympathy . Paul Ellison . " Mary and Beth and Tim sat alone in the small family room off to one side of the parlor , the children red-eyed and still . The casket with Edward 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to think about the reason . The minister was speaking : " Lord , thou hast been our dwelling place . In all generations , before the mountains were brought forth , or ever thou hadst formed the earth and the world , ever from everlasting to everlasting , thou art God . Therefore , we will not fear , though the earth doth change ,  | and though the mountains be shaken into the heart of the seas . . . " She and Edward were in the small sailboat on Milford Lake . " Do you like to sail ? " he had asked her the first night they dated . " I 've never been sailing . " " Saturday , " he said . " We have a date . " They were married one week later . " Do you know why I married you , lady ? " Edward teased . " You passed the test . You laughed a lot and you did n't fall overboard . " When the service ended , Mary and the children got into the long , black limousine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cemetery on Ash Street is a vast park , with a graveled road circling it . It is the oldest cemetery in Junction City , and many of the headstones have long since been eroded by time and weather . Because of the numbing cold , the graveside ceremony was kept brief . " I am the resurrection and the life ; he that believeth in me , though he were dead , yet shall he live ; and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die . I am he that liveth and was dead ; and , behold , I am alive forever more . " Finally , mercifully , it was over . Mary and the children stood in the howling wind watching the casket being lowered into the frozen , uncaring earth . Good-bye , my darling . Death is supposed to be an ending , but for Mary Ashley it was the beginning of an , unbearable hell . She and Edward had talked about death , and Mary thought she had come to terrns with it , but now death had suddenly assumed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer a vague event that would happen on some far , distant day . There was no way to cope with it . Everything within Mary screamed to deny what had happened to Edward . When he died ,  | everything wonderful died with him . The reality kept hitting her in fresh waves of shock . She wanted to be alone . She cowered deep within herself , feeling like a small , terrified child abandoned by an adult . She found herself raging against God . Why did n't you take me first ? she demanded . She was furious with Edward for deserting her , furious with the children , furious with herself . I 'm a thirty-five-year-old woman with two children , and I do n't know who I am . When I was Mrs. Edward Ashley , I had an identity , I belonged to someone who belonged to me . Time was spinning by , mocking her emptiness . Her life was like a runaway train over which she had no control . Florence and Douglas and other friends stayed with her , trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away and leave her alone . Florence came in one afternoon and found Mary in front of the television set watching a Kansas State football game . " She did n't even know I was there , " Florence told her husband that evening . " She was concentrating so desperately on that game . " She shivered . " It was spooky . " " Why ? " " Mary hates football . It was Edward who watched every game . " It took Mary 's last ounce of willpower to handle the detritus left by Edward 's death . There was the will , and insurance , and bank accounts and taxes and bills due and Edward 's medical corporation and loans and assets and deficits , and she wanted to scream at the lawyers and bankers and accountants to leave her in peace . I do n't want to cope , she wept . Edward was gone , and all anyone wanted to talk about was money . Finally , she was forced to discuss it . Frank Dunphy , Edward 's accountant , said , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use up a lot of the life-  | insurance money , Mrs. Ashley . Your husband was pretty lax about his patients paying him , He 's owed a lot of money . I 'll arrange for a collection agency to go after the people who owe ? " " No , " Mary said fiercely . " Edward would n't want that . " Dunphy was at a loss . " Well , then , I guess the bottom line is that your assets are thirty thousand dollars in cash and this house , which has a mortgage on it . If you sold the house ? " " Edward would n't want me to sell it . " She sat there , stiff and rigid , holding in her misery , and Dunphy thought : I wish to God my wife cared that much about me . The worst was yet to come . It was time to dispose of Edward 's personal things . Florence offered to help her , but Mary said , " No . Edward would have wanted me to do it . " There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pipes , a fresh can of tobacco , two pairs of reading glasses , notes for a medical lecture he would never give . She went into Edward 's closet and ran her fingers over suits he would never again wear . The blue tie he had worn on their last night together . His gloves and scarf that kept him warm against the winter winds . He would not need them in his cold grave . She carefully put away his razor and toothbrushes , moving like an automaton . She found love notes they had written to each other , bringing back memories of the lean days when Edward started his own practice , a Thanksgiving dinner without a turkey , summer picnics and winter sleigh rides , and her first pregnancy and both of them reading and playing classical music to l3eth while she was in the womb , and the love letter Edward wrote when Tim was born , and the gold-plated apple Edward had given her when she began teaching , and a hundred other wonderful things that brought tears to her eyes . His death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | Edward was there , alive , talking , smiling , loving , and the next moment he had vanished into the cold earth . I 'm a mature person . I have to accept reality . I 'm not mature . I ca n't accept it . I do n't want to live . She lay awake through the long night , thinking how simple it would be to join Edward , to stop the unbearable agony , to be at peace . We 're brought up to expect a happy ending , Mary thought . But there are no happy endings . There 's only death waiting for us . We find love and happiness , and it 's snatched away from us without rhyme or reason . We 're on a deserted spaceship careening mindlessly among the stars . The world is Dachau , and we 're all Jews . She finally dozed off , and in the middle of the night her wild screams awakened the children , and they ran to her bedside and crawled into bed with her , hugging her . " You 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whispered . Mary thought : I ca n't kill myself . They need me . Edward would never forgive me . She had to go on living . For them . She had to give them the love Edward would not be able to give them . We 're all so needy without Edward . We need one another so terribly . It 's ironic that Edward 's death is harder to bear because we had such a wonderful life together . There are so many more reasons to miss him , so many memories of things that will never happen again . Where are you , God ? Are you listening to me ? Help me . Please help me . Ring Lardner said , " Three out of three are going to die , so shut up and deal . " I have to deal . I 'm being terribly selfish . I 'm behaving badly , as if I 'm the only person in the world who is suffering . God is n't trying to punish me . Life is a cosmic grab bag . At this moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child , skiing down a mountain , having an orgasm , getting a haircut , lying on a bed of pain , singing on a stage , drowning , getting married , starving in a gutter .  | In the end , are n't we all that same person ? An aeon is a thousand million years , and an aeon ago every atom in our bodies was a part of a star . Pay attention to me , God . We are all a part of your universe , and if we die , part of your universe dies with us . Edward was everywhere . He was in the songs Mary heard on the radio , in the hills they had driven through together . He was in bed at her side when she awoke at sunrise . Got to get up early this morning , honey . I have a hysterectomy and a hip operation . His voice came to her clearly . She began to talk to him : I 'm worried about the children , Edward . They do n't want to go to school . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wo n't be here . Mary went to visit the cemetery every day , standing in the icy air , mourning for what was lost to her forever . But it gave her no comfort . You 're not here , Mary thought . Tell me - there you are . Please . She thought of the story by Marguerite Yourcenar , " How Wang-Fo Was Saved . " It was the tale of a Chinese artist condemned to death by his emperor for lying , for creating pictures of a world whose beauty was contradicted by reality . But the artist cheated the emperor by painting a boat and sailing away in it . I want to escape too , Mary thought . I ca n't stand it here without you , darling . Florence and Douglas tried to comfort her . " He 's at peace , " they told Mary . And a hundred other cliches . The easy words of solace , except that there was no solace . Not now . Not ever . She would awaken in the middle of the night and rush into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My children are going to die , Mary thought . We 're all going to die . People were calmly walking the streets . Idiots , laughing ,  | happy  --  and they are all dying . Their hours were numbered , and they wasted them playing stupid card games and going to silly movies and pointless football games . Wake up ! she wanted to scream . The earth is God 's slaughterhouse , and we 're his cattle . Do n't they know what 's going to happen to them and to everyone they love ? The answer came to her slowly , painfully , through the heavy black veils of grief . Of course they knew . Their games were a form of defiance , their laughter an act of bravado  --  a bravado born from the knowledge that life was finite , that everyone faced the same fate ; and slowly her fear and anger melted and turned to wonder at the courage of her fellow human beings . I 'm ashamed of myself . I have to find my own way through the maze of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone , but in the meantime , we must all huddle together to give one another comfort and warmth . The Bible says that death is not a final ending , it is merely a transition . Edward would never leave her and the children . He was there , somewhere . She carried on conversations with him . I talked to Tim 's teacher today . His grades are improving . Beth is in bed with a cold . Remember how she usually gets them this time of the year ? We 're all having dinner over at Florence and Douglas 's tonight . They 've been wonderful , darling . And , in the middle of the black night , The dean stopped by the house . He wanted to know whether I planned to go back to teaching at the university . I told him not now . I do n't want to leave the children alone , even for a little while . They need me so much . Do you think I should go hack one day ? A few days later : Douglas , got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staff at the hospital . Could Edward hear her ? She did not know . Was there a God , and was there a hereafter ? Or was it a fable ? T. S. Eliot said : " Without some kind of God , man is not even very interesting . "  | President Paul Ellison , Stanton Rogers , and Floyd Baker were meeting in the Oval Office . The secretary of state said , " Mr. President , we 're both getting a lot of pressure . I do n't think we can hold off any longer on naming an ambassador to Romania . I 'd like you to look over the list I gave you and select ? " " Thanks , Floyd . I appreciate your efforts . I still think Mary Ashley would be ideal . Her domestic situation has changed . What was rotten luck for her may turn out to be good luck for us . I want to try her again . " He turned to Stanton Rogers . " Stan , I 'd like you to fly out to Kansas and persuade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's what you want , Mr. President . " Mary was preparing dinner when the telephone rang , and when she picked it up , an operator said , " This is the White House . The President is calling Mrs. Edward Ashley . " Not now , she thought . I do n't want to speak to him or anyone . She remembered how excited his call had once made her . Now it was meaningless . She said , " This is Mrs. Ashley , but ? " " Would you please hold ? " Moments later the familiar voice came on the line . " Mrs. Ashley , this is Paul Ellison . I just want you to know how terribly sorry we are about your husband . I understand he was a fine man . " " Thank you , Mr. President . It was kind of you to send dowers . " " I do n't want to intrude on your privacy , Mrs. Ashley , and I know it 's been a very short time , but now that your domestic situation has changed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ambassadorship . " " Thank you , but I could n't possibly ? " " Hear me out , please . I 'm having someone fly out there to talk to you . His name is Stanton Rogers . I would appre-  | ciate it if you would at least meet with him . " She did not know what to say . How could she explain that her world had been turned upside down , that her life had been shattered ? All that mattered now were Beth and Tim . She decided that in all courtesy she would see the man and then refuse as gracefully as possible . " I 'll meet with him , Mr. President , but I wo n't change my mind . " There was a popular bar on the Boulevard Bineau that Mann Groza 's guards frequented when they were not on duty at the villa in Neuilly . Even Lev Pasternak occasionally visited the bar . Angel selected a table in an area of the room where conversations could be overheard . The guards , away from the rigid routine of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they talked . Angel listened , seeking the villa 's vulnerable point . There was always a vulnerable point . One simply had to be clever enough to find it . It was three days before Angel overheard a conversation that gave the clue to the solution of the problem . A guard was saying , " I do n't know what Groza is doing to the whores he brings in there , but they 're sure whipping the hell out of him . You should hear the screaming that goes on . Last week I got a look at the whips he keeps in his closet . . . . " And the next night : " The hookers our fearless leader gets up at the villa are real beauties . They bring them in from all over the world . Lev arranges it himself . He 's smart . He never uses the same girl twice . That way , no one can use the girls to get at Marin Groza . " It was all Angel needed .  | Early the following morning , Angel changed rental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shop was in Montmartre , on the Place Pigalle , in the middle of a section populated by whores and pimps . Angel went inside , walking slowly along the aisles , carefully studying the merchandise for sale . There were shackles and chains and iron-studded helmets , leather pants with slits in front , penis massagers and Joy Jelly , inflatable rubber dolls and porno videotapes . There were male douches and anal cream and six-foot-long braided leather whips with thongs at the end . Angel selected a whip , paid cash for it , and left . The following morning , Angel brought the whip back to the shop . The manager looked up and growled , " No refunds . " " I do n't want a refund , " Angel explained . " I feel awkward carrying this around . I would appreciate it if you would mail it for me . I 'll pay extra , of course . " Late that afternoon , Angel was on a plane to Buenos Aires . The whip , carefully wrapped , arrived at the villa in Neuilly the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gatehouse . He read the store label on the package , opened it , and examined the whip with great care . You would think the old man had enough of these already . He passed it through , and a guard took it to Marin Groza 's bedroom closet , where he placed it with the other whips .  |  | Fort Riley , one of the oldest active army forts in the United States , was constructed in 1853 when Kansas was still referred to as Indian territory . It was built to protect wagon trains from Indian war parties . Today it is used primarily as a helicopter base and a landing field for smaller military fixedwing planes . When Stanton Rogers landed in a DC-7 , he was welcomed by the base commander and his staff . A limousine was standing by , waiting to drive Stanton to the Ashley home . Ile had telephoned Mary after the President 's call . " I promise to make my yisit as brief as possible , Mrs. Ashley . I plan to fly in Monday afternoon to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's being so polite . And he 's such an important man . Why is the President sending him to talk to me ? " That will he fine . " In a reflex action , Mary asked , " Would you care to have dinner with us ? "  | He hesitated . " Thank you . " It 's going to be a long , boring evening , Stanton thought . When Florence Schiffer heard the news , she was thrilled . " The President 's foreign affairs adviser is coming to dinner here ? That means you 're going to accept the appointment ! " " Florence , it means nothing of the kind . I promised the President I would talk to him . That 's all . " Florence put her arms around Mary and hugged her . " I just want you to do whatever makes you happy . " " I know that . " Stanton Rogers was a formidable man , Mary decided . She had seen him on Meet the Press and in photographs in Time magazine , but she thought : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but there was something distant about him . " Permit me to convey again the President 's sincere regrets about your terrible tragedy , Mrs. Ashley . " " Thank you . " She introduced him to Beth and Tim . They made small talk while Mary went into the kitchen to see how Lucinda was getting along with the dinner . " Whenever you 're ready , " Lucinda said . " But he 'll hate it . " When Mary had told Lucinda that Stanton Rogers was coming to the house for dinner and that she wanted her to make a pot roast , Lucinda had said , " People like Mr. Rogers do n't eat pot roast . " " Oh ? What do they eat ? " " Chateaubriand and crepes suzette . " " We 're having pot roast . " " All right , " Lucinda had said stubbornly , " but it 's the wrong dinner . " Along with the pot roast she had prepared creamed mashed potatoes , fresh vegetables , and a salad . She had baked a pumpkin pie for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | During dinner Mary and he discussed the problems of the farmers . " The farmers in the Midwest are caught in a terrible squeeze between low prices and overproduction , " Mary said earnestly . " They 're too poor to paint , and too proud to whitewash . " They talked about the colorful history of Junction City , and Stanton Rogers finally brought the discussion around to Romania . " What is your opinion of President Ionescu 's government ? " he asked Mary . " There is no government in Romania , in the real sense of the word , " Mary replied . " Ionescu is the government . He 's in total control . " " Do you think there will be a revolution there ? " " Not in the present circumstances . The only man powerful enough to depose him is Marin Groza , who 's in exile in France . " The questioning went on . She was an expert on the iron curtain countries , and Stanton Rogers was visibly impressed . Mary had the uncomfortable feeling that he had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closer to the mark than she knew . Paul was right , Stanton Rogers thought . She really is an authority on Romania . And there was something more . We ' red the opposite of the ugly American . She 's beautiful . And she and the children make an all-American package that will %ell . Stanton found himself getting more and more excited by the prospect . She can be more useful than she realizes . At the end of the evening , Stanton Rogers said , " Mrs. Ashley , I 'm going to be frank with you . Initially I was against the President appointing you to a post as sensitive as Romania . I told him as much . I tell you this now because I 've hanged my mind . I think you may very well make an excellent ambassador . "  | Mary shook her head . " I 'm sorry , Mr. Rogers . I 'm no politician . I 'm just an amateur . " " As President Ellison pointed out to me , some of our finest ambassadors have been amateurs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the foreign service . Walter Annenberg , our former ambassador to the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland , was a publisher . " " I 'm not ? " " John Kenneth Galbraith , our ambassador to India , was a professor . Mike Mansfield started out as a reporter before he became a senator and then was appointed our ambassador to Japan . I could give you a dozen more examples . These people were all what you would call amateurs . What they had , Mrs. Ashley , was intelligence , a love for their country , and goodwill toward the people of the country where they were sent to serve . " " You make it sound so simple . " " As you 're probably aware , you 've already been investigated very thoroughly . You 've been approved for a security clearance , you have no problem with the IRS , and there 's no conflict of interest . According to Dean Hunter you 're an excellent teacher , and of course you 're an expert on Romania . You 've got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have the kind of image the President wants to project in the iron curtain countries , where they 're fed so much adverse propaganda about us . " Mary listened , a thoughtful expression on her face . " Mr. Rogers , I want you and the President to know that I appreciate everything you 've said . But I could n't accept it . I have Beth and Tim to think about . I ca n't just uproot them like ? " " There 's a fine school for diplomats ' children in Bucharest , " Rogers told her . " It would be a wonderful education for Tim and Beth to spend time in a foreign country . They 'd learn things they could never learn in school here . "  | " I do n't  --  I 'll think about it . " " I 'm staying in town overnight , " Stanton Rogers said . " I 'll be at the All Seasons Motel . Believe me , Mrs. Ashley , I know what a big decision this is for you . But this program is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Please think about that . " When Stanton Rogers left , Mary went upstairs . The children were waiting for her , wide awake and excited . " Are you going to take the job ? " Beth asked . " We have to have a talk . If I did decide to accept it , it would mean that you would have to leave school and all your friends . You would be living in a foreign country where we do n't speak the language , and you would be going to a strange school . " " Tim and I talked about all that , " Beth said , " and you know what we think ? " " What ? " " That any country would be really lucky to have you as an ambassador , Mom . " She talked to Edward that night : You should have heard him , darling . He made it sound as though the President really needed me . There are probably a million people who could do a better job than I could , but he was very flattering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how exciting it would be ? Well , I have the chance again , and I do n't know what to do . To tell you the truth , I 'm terrified . This is our home . How can I bear to leave it ? There 's so much of you here . She found that she was crying . This is all I have left of oil . Help me decide . Please help me . . . She sat by the window in her robe , looking out at the trees shivering in the howling , restless wind . At dawn she made her decision . The conversation was not going the way Mary had planned .  | At nine o'clock in the morning , Mary telephoned the All Seasons Motel and asked for Stanton Rogers . When he came on the line , she said , " Mr. Rogers , would you please tell the President that I will be honored to accept his nomination for the ambassadorship. "  | This one 's even more beautiful than the others , the guard thought . She did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movie actress or a model . She was in her early twenties , with long blond hair and a clear , milky complexion . She wore a designer dress . Lev Pasternak came to the gate himself to conduct her to the house . The girl , Bisera , was a Yugoslavian , and it was her first trip to France . The sight of all the armed security guards made her nervous . I wonder what I 've gotten into ? All Bisera knew was that her pimp had handed her a roundtrip plane ticket and told her she would be paid two thousand dollars for an hour 's work . Lev Pasternak knocked at a bedroom door and Groza 's voice called out , " Come in . " Pasternak opened the door and ushered the girl inside . Marin Groza was standing at the foot of the bed . He had on a robe , and she could tell he was naked under it .  | Lev Pasternak said , " This is Bisera . " He did not mention Marin Groza 's name . " Good evening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , carefully closing the door behind him , and Marin Groza was alone with the girl . She moved toward him and smiled seductively . " You look comfortable . Why do n't I get undressed and we can both be comfortable ? " She started to get out of her dress . " No . Keep your clothes on , please . " She looked at him in surprise . " Do n't you want me to ? ? " Groza walked over to the closet and selected a whip . " I want you to use this . " So that was it . A slave fetish . Strange . He did not look the type . You never know , Bisera thought . " Sure , honey . Whatever turns you on . " Marin Groza took off his robe and turned around . Bisera was shocked by the sight of his scarred body . It was covered with cruel welts . There was something in his expression that puzzled her , and when she realized what it was , she was even more perplexed . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pain . Why did he want to be whipped ? She watched him as he walked over to a stool and sat on it . " Hard , " he commanded . " Whip me very hard . " " All right . " Bisera picked up the long leather whip . Sadomasochism was not new to her , but there was something different here that she did not understand . Well , it 's none of my business , Bisera thought . Take the money and run . She raised the whip and cracked it down against his naked back . " Harder , " he urged . " Harder . " He flinched with pain as the tough leather beat against his skin . Once . . . and twice . . . and again . . . and again , harder and harder . The vision he had been waiting for came to him then . Scenes of his wife and his daughter being raped seared through his brain . It was a gang rape , and the laughing soldiers went from the woman to the child , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their turn . Marin Groza strained against the stool as though bound to it . As the whip fell again and again he could hear the screams of his wife and daughter begging for mercy , choking on the men 's penises in their mouths , being raped and sodomized at the same time , until the blood started pouring out and their cries finally trailed off . And Marin Groza groaned , " Harder ! " And with each crack of the whip he felt the sharp blade of the knife tearing into his genitals , castrating him . He was having difficulty breathing . " Get  --  get ? " His voice was a croak . His lungs felt paralyzed . The girl stopped , holding the whip in midair . " Hey ! Are you all right ? I ? ? " She watched as he toppled to the floor , his eyes open , staring at nothing . Bisera screamed , " Help ! Help ! " Lev Pasternak came running in , gun in hand . He saw the figure on the floor . " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead . He 's dead ! I did n't do anything . I just whipped him like he told me to . I swear ! " The doctor , who lived in the villa , came into the room within seconds . He looked at Marin Groza 's body , and bent down to examine him . The skin had turned blue and the muscles were rigid . He picked up the whip and smelled it . " What ? " " Damn ! Curare . It 's an extract from a South American plant . The Incas used it on darts to kill their enemies . Within three minutes the entire nervous system is paralyzed . " The two men stood there , staring helplessly at their dead leader . The news of Marin Groza 's assassination was carried all over the world by satellite . Lev Pasternak was able to keep the sordid details away from the press . In Washington , D.C. ,  | the President had a meeting with Stanton Rogers . " Who do you think 's behind it , Stan ? " " Either the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same thing , does n't it ? They did n't want the status quo disturbed . " " So we 'll be dealing with Ionescu . Very well . Let 's push the Mary Ashley appointment through as quickly as possible . " " She 's on her way here , Paul . No problem . " " Good . " On hearing the news , Angel smiled . It happened sooner than I thought . At ten P.M. the private phone rang and the Controller picked it up . " Hello . " He heard the sound of Neusa Munez 's guttural voice . " Angel saw this mornin 's paper . He say to deposit the money in his bank account . " " Inform him that it will be taken care of immediately . And Miss Munez , tell Angel how pleased I am . Also tell him that I may need him again very soon . Do you have a telephone number where I can reach you ? " There was a long pause , then : " I guess so . " She gave it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The line went dead . Damn the stupid bitch . The money was deposited in the account in Zurich that morning , and one hour after it was received it was transferred to a Saudi Arabian bank in Geneva . A person ca n't be too careful these days , Angel thought . The goddamned bankers will cheat you every chance they get .  | It was more than packing up a household . It was packing up a life . It was bidding farewell to thirteen years of dreams , memories , love . It was saying a final good-bye to Edward . This had been their home , and now it would become merely a house again , occupied by strangers with no awareness of the joys and sorrows and tears and laughter that had happened within these walls . Douglas and Florence Schiffer were delighted that Mary had decided to accept the post . " You 'll be fantastic , " Florence assured Mary . " Doug and I will miss you and the kids . " " Promise that you 'll come to Romania to visit us. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the practical details that had to be taken care of , a multitude of unfamiliar responsibilities . She made a list : Call the storage company to pick up personal things that we 're leaving . Cancel milkman . Cancel newspaper . Give postman new mailing address . Sign lease on house . Arrange for insurance . Change over utilities . Pay all bills . Do n't Panic ! An indefinite leave of absence from the university had been arranged with Dean Hunter . " I 'll have someone take over your undergraduate classes . That 's no problem . But your seminar students are certainly going to miss you . " He smiled . " I 'm sure you 'll do us all proud , Mrs. Ashley . Good luck . " " Thank you . " Mary withdrew the children from their school . There were travel arrangements to be made and airline tickets to be bought . In the past , Mary had taken all the financial transactions for granted because Edward had been there to handle them . Now there was no Edward , except in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be . Mary was worried about Beth and Tim . In the beginning , they had been enthusiastic about living in a foreign country , but now that they were face-to-face with the reality , they were filled with apprehension . They each came to Mary separately . " Mother , " Beth said , " I ca n't just leave all my friends . 1  | may never see Virgil again . Maybe I could stay here until the end of the semester . " Tim said , " I just got into Little League . If I go away , they 'll find another third baseman . Maybe we can go after next summer , when the season 's over . Please , Mom ! " They 're frightened . Like their mother . Stanton Rogers had been so convincing . But alone with her fears in the middle of the night , Mary thought : I do n't know anything about being an ambassador . I 'm a Kansas housewife pretending to be some kind of statesman . Everyone 's going to know I 'm a fraud . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , miraculously , everything was ready . The house had been rented on a long lease to a family that had just moved to Junction City . It was time to leave . " Doug and I will drive you to the airport , " Florence insisted . The airport where they would catch the six-passenger commuter plane to Kansas City , Missouri , was located in Manhattan , Kansas . In Kansas City , they would transfer to a larger plane to Washington , D.C. " Just give me a minute , " Mary said . She walked upstairs to the bedroom she and Edward had shared for so many wonderful years . She stood there , taking a long last look . I 'm leaving now , my dearest . I just wanted to say goodbye . I think I 'M doing what you would have liked me to do . I hope I am . The only thing that really bothers me is that I have a feeling we may never come back here . I feel as though I 'm deserting you . But you 'll be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than I 've ever needed you . Stay with me . Help me . I love you so much . Sometimes I do n't think I can stand it without you . Can you hear me , darling ? Are you there . . . ?  | Douglas Schiffer saw to it that their baggage was checked onto the little commuter plane . When Mary saw the plane sitting on the tarmac , she froze in her tracks . " Oh , my God ! " " What 's the matter ? " Florence asked . " I  --  I 've been so busy , I forgot all about it . " " About what ? " " Flying ! Florence , I 've never been up in a plane in my life ! I ca n't go up in that little thing ! " " Mary  --  the odds are a million to one against anything happening . " " I do n't like the odds , " Mary said flatly . " We 'll take the train . " " You ca n't . They 're expecting you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm not going to be any good to them dead . " It took the Schiffers fifteen minutes to persuade Mary to board the plane . Half an hour later , she and the children were strapped aboard Air Midwest flight number 826 . As the motors revved up and the plane began racing down the runway , Mary closed her eyes and gripped the arms of her seat . Seconds later , they were airborne . " Mama ? " " Sh ! Do n't talk ! " She sat rigid , refusing to look out the window , concentrating on keeping the plane in the air . The children were pointing out the sights below , having a wonderful time . Children , Mary thought bitterly . What do they know ! At the Kansas City airport they changed to a DC-10 and took off for Washington , D.C. Beth and Tim were seated together and Mary was across the aisle from them . An elderly lady sat next to Mary .  | " To tell you the truth , I 'm a little nervous , " Mary 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mary patted her hand and smiled . " There 's nothing to be nervous about . The odds are a million to one against anything happening . "  | page deleted  | page deleted  | page deleted  | page deleted  | Mary looked at John Burns in embarrassment . " I 'm afraid the children are n't very sophisticated , " she apologized . " You see , they 've never been away from ? " She glanced out the window and her eyes widened . " Oh , my goodness ! " she cried . " Look ! It 's the White House ! " The limousine moved up Pennsylvania Avenue , surrounded by some of the most stirring landmarks in the world . Mary thought excitedly : This is the city that rules the world . This is where the power is . And in a small way I 'm going to be a part of it . As the limousine approached the hotel , Mary asked , " When will I see Mr. Rogers ? " " He 'll be in touch with you in the morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counterintelligence section of the CIA , was working late , and his day was far from over . Every morning at three A.M. a team reported to prepare the President 's daily intelligence checklist , collected from overnight cables . The report , code-named " Pickles , " had to be ready by six A.M. so that it could be on the President 's desk at the start of his day . An armed courier carried the list to the White House , entering at the west gate . Pete Connors had a renewed interest in the intercepted-cable traffic coming from behind the iron curtain , because much of it concerned the appointment of Mary Ashley as the American ambassador to Romania . The Soviet Union was worried that President Ellison 's plan was a ploy to penetrate their satellite countries , to spy on them or seduce them . The Commies are n't as worried as I am , Pete Connors thought grimly . If the President 's idea works , this whole country is going to be open house for their fucking spies . Pete Connors had been informed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen photographs of her and the children . She 's going to be perfect , Connors thought happily .  | The Riverdale Towers , one block away from the Watergate complex , is a small family hotel with comfortable , nicely decorated suites . A bellman brought up the luggage , and as Mary started unpacking , the telephone rang . Mary picked it up . " Hel-lo A masculine voice said , " Mrs. Ashley ? " " Yes . " " My name is Ben Cohn . I 'm a reporter with The Washington Post . I wonder if we could talk for a few minutes . " Mary hesitated . " We just checked in and I 'm ? " " It will only take five minutes . I really just wanted to say hello . " " Well , I  --  I suppose ? " " I 'm on my way up . " Ben Cohn was short and stocky , with a muscular body and the battered face of a prizefighter . He looks like a sports reporter , Mary thought . He sat in an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Washington , Mrs. Ashley ? " Ben Cohn asked . " Yes . " She noticed that he had no notebook or tape recorder . " I wo n't ask you the dumb question . " She frowned . " What 's the dumb question ' ? " " How do you like Washington ? Whenever a celebrity steps off an airplane somewhere , the first thing they 're asked is , How do you like this place ? " Mary laughed . " I 'm not a celebrity , but I think I 'm going to like Washington a lot . " " You were a professor at Kansas State University ? " " Yes . I taught a course called Eastern Europe : Today 's Politics . " " I understand that the President first learned about you  | when he read a book of yours on Eastern Europe and several of your magazine articles . " " Yes . " " And the rest , as they say , is history . " " I suppose it is an unusual way to ? " " Not that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the same way , and he made her ambassador to the UN . " He smiled at her . " So you see , there 's precedent . That 's one of the big buzzwords in Washington . Precedent . Your grandparents were Romanian ? " " My grandfather . That 's right . " Ben Cohn stayed for another fifteen minutes , getting information on Mary 's background . Mary asked , " When will this interview appear in the paper ? " She wanted to be sure to send copies to Florence and Douglas and her other friends back home . Ben Cohn rose and said evasively , " I 'm going to save it for now . " There was something about the situation that puzzled him . The problem was that he was not sure what it was . " We 'll be talking again later . " After he left , Beth and Tim came into the living room . " Was he nice , Mom ? " " Yes . " She hesitated , unsure . " I think so . " The following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ashley . It 's Stanton Rogers . " It was like hearing the voice of an old friend . Maybe it 's because he 's the only person in town I know , Mary thought . " Good morning , Mr. Rogers . Thank you for having Mr. Burns meet us at the airport , and for arranging our hotel . " " I trust it 's satisfactory ? " " It 's lovely . " " I thought it would be a good idea if we met to discuss some of the procedures you 'll be going through . " " I would like that . "  | " Why do n't we make it lunch today at the Grand ? It 's not far from your hotel . One o'clock ? " " Fine . " " I 'll meet you in the downstairs dining room . " It was starting . Mary arranged for the children to have room service , and at one o'clock a taxi dropped her off at the Grand Hotel . Mary looked at it in awe . The Grand Hotel is its own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all over the world stay there , and it is easy to see why . It is an elegant building , with an imposing lobby that has Italian marble floors and gracious columns under a circular ceiling . There is a landscaped courtyard , with a fountain and an outdoor swimming pool . A marble staircase leads down to the promenade restaurant , where Stanton Rogers was waiting for her . " Good afternoon , Mrs. Ashley . " " Good afternoon , Mr. Rogers . " He laughed . " That sounds so formal . What about Stan and Mary ? " She was pleased . " That would be nice . " Stanton Rogers seemed different somehow , and the change was hard for Mary to define . In Junction City there had been an aloofness about him , almost a resentment toward her . Now that seemed to have completely vanished . He was warm and friendly . The difference is that he 's accepted me , Mary thought happily . " Would you like a drink ? " " Thank you , no . " They ordered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's not like the prices in Junction City . Her hotel suite was $250 a day . At that rate , my money 's not going to last very long , Mary thought . " Stan , I do n't want to seem rude , but can you tell me how much an ambassador is paid ? "  | He laughed . " That 's a fair question . Your salary will be sixty-five thousand dollars a year , plus a housing allowance . " " When does that begin ? " " The moment you 're sworn in . " " And until then ? " " You 'll be paid seventy-five dollars a day . " Her heart sank . That would not even take care of her hotel bill , let alone all the other expenses . " Will I be in Washington long ? " Mary asked . " About a month . We 'll do everything we can to expedite your move . The secretary of state has cabled the Romanian government for approval of your appointment . Just between us , there have already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be no problem with the Romanians , but you still have to pass the Senate . " So the Romanian government is going to accept me , Mary thought wonderingly . Perhaps I 'm better qualified than I realized . " I 've set up an informal consultation for you with the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee . The next step after that will be an open hearing of the full committee . They 'll ask you questions about your background , your loyalty to this country , your perceptions of the job , and what you hope to accomplish . " " What happens after that ? " " The committee votes , and when they turn in their report , the full Senate votes . " Mary said slowly , " Nominations have been voted down in the past , have n't they ? " " The President 's prestige is on the line with this one . You 'll have the full backing of the White House . The President is eager to push your appointment through as quickly as possible . Incidentally , I thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the next few days , so I 've ar-  | ranged for a car and driver for you , and a private tour of the White House . " " Oh ! Thank you so much . " Stanton Rogers smiled . " My pleasure . " The private tour of the White House was arranged for the following morning . A guide escorted them around . They were taken through the Jacqueline Kennedy Garden and the eighteenth-century-style American garden containing a pool , trees , and herbs for use in the White House kitchen . " Just ahead , " the guide announced , " is the East Wing . It houses military offices , congressional liaisons to the President , a visitor 's office , and offices of the First Lady 's staff . " They went through the West Wing and looked into the President 's Oval Office . " How many rooms have they got in this place ? " Tim asked . " There are one hundred and thirty-two rooms , sixty-nine closets , twenty-eight fireplaces , and thirty-two bathrooms . " " They sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President Washington helped supervise much of the construction of the White House . He is the only President who never resided here . " " I do n't blame him , " Tim muttered . " It 's too darned big . " Mary nudged him , red-faced . The tour took almost two hours , and by the end of it the Ashley family was exhausted and impressed . This is where it all began , Mary thought . And now I 'm going to be a part of it . " Mom ? " " Yes , Beth ? " " You have a funny look on your face . " The call from the President 's office came the following niurning . " Good morning , Mrs. Ashley . President Ellison wonders  | whether you could make yourself available this afternoon to meet with him ? " Mary swallowed . " Yes , I  --  of course . " " Would three o'clock be convenient ? " " That would be fine . " " A limousine will be downstairs for you at two forty-five . " Paul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He walked over to shake her hand , grinned , and said , " Gotcha ! " Mary laughed . " I 'm glad you did , Mr. President . This is a great honor for me . " " Sit down , Mrs. Ashley . May I call you Mary ? " " Please . " They sat down on the couch . President Ellison said , " You 're going to be my doppelganger . Do you know what that is ? " " It 's a kind of identical spirit of a living person . " " Right . And that 's us . I ca n't tell you how excited I was when I read your latest article , Mary . It was as though I were reading something I had written . There are a lot of people who do n't believe our people-to-people plan can work , but you and I are going to fool them . " Our people-to-people plan . We 're going to fool them . He 's a charmer , Mary thought . Aloud , she said , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President . " " I 'm counting on you . Very heavily . Romania is the testing ground . Since Groza was assassinated , your job is going to be more difficult . If we can pull it off there , we can make it work in the other Communist countries . " They spent the next thirty minutes discussing some of the problems that lay ahead , and then Paul Ellison said , " Stan Rogers will keep in close touch with you . He 's become a big fan of yours . " He held out his hand . " Good luck , doppelganger. "  | The next afternoon Stanton Rogers telephoned Mary . " You have an appointment at nine o'clock tomorrow morning with the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee . " The Committee on Foreign Relations has offices in the Dirksen Building . A plaque in the hallway at the right side of the door reads : COMMITTEE ON FOREIGN RELATIONS SD-419 . The chairman was a rotund , gray-haired man with sharp green eyes and the easy manner of a professional politician . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's a pleasure to meet you , Mrs. Ashley . I 've certainly been hearing a lot about you . " Good or bad ? Mary wondered . He led her to a chair . " Some coffee ? " " No , thank you , Senator . " She was too nervous to hold a cup in her hand . " Well , then , let 's get right down to business . The President is eager to have you represent us in Romania . Naturally , we all want to give him our full support in every way possible . The question is  --  do you think you 're qualified to handle that position , Mrs. Ashley ? " " No , sir . " Her answer caught him off guard . " I beg your pardon ? " " If you mean have I had any diplomatic experience in dealing with foreign countries , then I 'm not qualified . However , I 've been told that one third of the country 's ambassadors are also people without previous experience . What I would bring to my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with its economic and sociological problems and with its political background . I believe I could project a positive image of our country to the Romanians . " Well , Charlie Campbell thought in surprise . I expected a bubblehead . In fact , Campbell had resented Mary Ashley even before meeting her . He had been given orders from the top " ' to see that Mary Ashley got his committee 's approval no  | matter what they thought of her . A lot of snickering was going on in the corridors of power about what a gaffe the President had made by selecting an unknown hayseed from a place called Junction City , Kansas . But , by God , Campbell thought , I think the boys may be in for a little surprise . Aloud , he said , " The full Hearing Committee meets at nine o'clock Wednesday morning . " The night before the hearing , Mary was in a panic . Darling , when they question me about my experience , what am I going to tell them ? That in Junction City I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three years in a row ? I 'm panicky . Oh , how I wish you were here with me . But once again the irony struck her . If Edward were alive , she would not be here . I 'd be safe and warm at home with my husband and children , where I belong . She lay awake all night . The hearing was held in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee room , with the full fifteen members of the committee present , seated at a dais in front of a wall that held four large world maps . Along the left side of the room was the press table , filled with reporters , and in the center , seats for two hundred spectators . The corners were brightly lighted for television cameras . The room was filled to overflowing . Pete Connors sat in a back row . There was a sudden hush as Mary entered with Beth and Tim . Mary was wearing a dark tailored suit and a white blouse . The children had been forced out of their jeans and sweaters and were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the press table , watched as they came in . Jesus , he thought , they look like a Norman Rockwell cover . An attendant seated the children in a front row , and Mary  | was escorted to the witness chair facing the committee . She sat under the glare of the hot lights , trying to conceal her nervousness . The hearing began . Charlie Campbell smiled down at Mary . " Good morning , Mrs. Ashley . We thank you for appearing before this committee . We will proceed to the questions . " They started innocently enough . " Name . . . ? " " Widow . . . ? " " Children . . . ? " The questions were gentle and supportive . " According to the biography we 've been furnished , Mrs. Ashley , for the last several years you 've taught political science at Kansas State University . Is that correct ? " " Yes , sir . " " You 're a native of Kansas ? " " Yes , Senator . " " Your grandparents were Romanian ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 've written a book and articles on rapprochement between the United States and Soviet-bloc countries ? " " Yes , sir . " " The latest article was printed in Foreign Affairs magazine and came to the attention of the President ? " " That 's my understanding . " " Mrs. Ashley , would you kindly tell this committee what the basic premise of your article is ? " Iler nerv6usness was rapidly disappearing . She was on sure ttimind now , discussing a subject on which she was an authority . She felt as though she were conducting a seminar at Sc hool . " Several regional economic pacts currently exist in the H orld , and because they are mutually exclusive , they serve to divide the world into antagonistic and competitive blocs , instead of uniting it . Europe has the Common Market , the  | Eastern Bloc has COMECON , and then there is the OECD , consisting of the free market countries , and the nonaligned movement of Third World states . My premise is very simple : I would like to see all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Individuals who are engaged in a profitable partnership do n't kill one another . I believe that the same principle applies to countries . I would like to see our country spearhead a movement to form a common market that includes allies and adversaries alike . Today , as an example , we 're paying billions of dollars to store surplus grain in grain elevators while people in dozens of countries are starving . The one-world common market could solve that . It could cure inequities of distribution , at fair market prices for everyone . I would like to try to help make that happen . " Senator Harold Turkel , a senior member of the Foreign Relations Committee and a member of the Opposition party , spoke up . " I 'd like to ask the nominee a few questions . " Ben Cohn leaned forward in his seat . Here we go . Senator Turkel was in his seventies , tough and abrasive , a noted curmudgeon . " Is this your first time in Washington , Mrs. Ashley ? " " Yes , sir . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I suppose you 've done a good deal of traveling ? " " Well , no . My husband and I had planned to travel , but ? " " Have you ever been to New York ? " " No , sir . " " California ? " " No , sir . " " Been to Europe ? " " No . As I said , we planned to ? " " Have you , in fact , ever been outside the state of Kansas , Mrs. Ashley ? " " Yes . I gave a lecture at the University of Chicago and a series of talks in Denver and Atlanta . "  | Turkel said dryly , " That must have been very exciting for you , Mrs. Ashley . I ca n't recall when this committee has been asked to approve a less-qualified candidate for an ambassadorial post . You expect to represent the United States of America in a sensitive iron curtain country , and you 're telling us that your entire knowledge of the world comes from living in Junction City , Kansas , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Atlanta . Is that true ? " Mary was aware of the television cameras focused on her , and she held back her temper . " No , sir . My knowledge of the world comes from studying it . I have a Ph.D . in political science and I 've been teaching at Kansas State University for five years , with an emphasis on the iron curtain countries . I 'm familiar with the current problems of the Romanian people and what their government thinks of the United States , and why . " Her voice was stronger now . " All they know about this country is what their propaganda machines tell them . I would like to go over there and try to convince them that the United States is not a greedy , war-hungry country . I would like to show them what a typical American gamily is like . I ? " She broke off , afraid she had gone too far in her anger . And then , to her surprise , the members of the committee started to applaud . All except Turkel . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Camphell asked , " Are there any more questions ? " " I think the nominee has expressed herself very clearly , " one of the senators commented . " I agree . Thank you , Mrs. Ashley . This session is adjourned . " Pete Connors studied Mary thoughtfully a moment , then quietly left as the members of the press swarmed around her . " Was Was the President 's appointment a surprise to you ? " " Do you think they 're going to approve your appointment , Mrs. Ashley ? "  | " Do you really believe that teaching about a country qualifies you to ? ? " " Turn this way , Mrs. Ashley . Smile , please . One more . " " Mrs. Ashley ? " Ben Cohn stood apart from the others , watching and listening . She 's good , he thought . She has all the right answers . I wish to hell I knew the right questions . When Mary arrived back at the hotel , emotionally drained , Stanton Rogers was on the telephone . " Hello , Madam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You mean I made it ? Oh , Stan . Thank you so much . I ca n't tell you how excited I am . " " So am I , Mary . " His voice was filled with pride . " So am I. " When Mary told the children , they hugged her . " I knew you 'd make it ! " Tim screamed . Beth asked quietly , " Do you think Daddy knows ? " " I 'm sure he does , darling . " Mary smiled . " I would n't be surprised if he gave the committee a little nudge . . . . " Mary telephoned Florence , and when she heard the news she began to cry . " Fantastic ! Wait until I spread this around town ! " Mary laughed . " I 'll have a room at the embassy ready for you and Douglas . " " When do you leave for Romania ? " " Well , first the full Senate has to vote , but Stan says it 's just a formality . " " What happens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few weeks of briefing sessions in Washington , and then the children and I are on our way to Romania . " " I ca n't wait to call The Daily Union ! " Florence ex-  | claimed . " The town will probably put up a statue to you . I 've got to go now . I 'm too excited to talk . 1 ' 11 call you tomorrow . " Ben Cohn heard the results of the confirmation hearing when he returned to his office . He was still bothered . And he did not know why .  |  | As Stanton Rogers predicted , the full Senate vote was a formality . Mary was voted in by a comfortable majority . When President Ellison heard the news , he said to Stanton Rogers , Our plan is under way , Stan . Nothing can stop us now . " Stanton Rogers nodded . " Nothing , " he agreed . Pete Connors was in his office when he received the news . I lc immediately wrote out a message and encoded it . One of his men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 want to use the Roger Channel , " Connors said . " Wait outside . " The Roger Channel is the CIA 's ultraprivate cable system , a ailable only for use by top-level executives . Messages are stilt by a laser transmitter on an ultrahigh frequency in a ( faction of a second . When Connors was alone , he dispatched the cable . It was addressed to Sigmund .  | During the next week , Mary called on the deputy secretary for political affairs , the head of the CIA , the secretary of commerce , the directors of the New York Chase Manhattan Bank , and several important Jewish organizations . Each of them had admonitions , advice , and requests . Ned Tillingast at the CIA was enthusiastic . " It will be great to get our people back into action there , Madam Ambassador . Romania 's been a blind spot for us since we became personae non gratae . I 'll assign a man to your embassy as one of your attaches . " He gave her a meaningful look . " I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mary wondered exactly what that meant . Do n't ask , she decided . The swearing-in ceremony of the new ambassadors is customarily presided over by the secretary of state , and there are usually twenty-five to thirty candidates sworn in at the same time . The morning the ceremony was to take place , Stanton Rogers telephoned Mary . " Mary , President Ellison has asked that you be at the White House at noon . The President himself is going to swear you in . Bring Tim and Beth . " The Oval Office was filled with members of the press . When President Ellison walked in with Mary and her children , television cameras began to turn and still cameras began to flash . Mary had spent the previous half hour with the President , and he had been warm and reassuring . " You 're perfect for this assignment , " he had told her , " or I would never have chosen you . You and I are going to make this dream come true . " And it does seem like a dream , Mary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Raise your right hand , please . " Mary repeated after the President : " I , Mary Elizabeth  | Ashley , do solemnly swear that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies foreign and domestic , that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same , that I take this obligation freely and without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion , that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office on which I am about to enter , so help me God . " And it was done . She was the ambassador to the Socialist Republic of Romania . The treadmill began . Mary was ordered to report to the European and Yugoslavian Affairs section at the State Department . There she was assigned a small , boxlike temporary office next to the Romanian desk . James Stickley , the Romanian desk officer , was a career diplomat with twenty-five years in the service . He was in his late fifties , of medium height , with a vulpine face and small , thin lips . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked with disdain on the political appointees who were invading his world . He was considered the foremost expert on the Romanian desk , and when President Ellison had announced his plan to appoint an ambassador to Romania , Stickley was ecstatic , fully expecting that the post would be given to him . The news about Mary Ashley was a bitter blow . It was bad enough to have been passed over , but to have lost out to a political appointee  --  a nobody from Kansas  --  was galling . " Can you believe it ? " he asked Bruce , his closest friend . " Half of our ambassadors are fucking appointees . That could never happen in England or France , chum . They use professional career officers . Would the army ask an amateur to be . i general ? Well , overseas our fucking amateur ambassadors ale generals . " " You 're drunk , Jimbo . " " I 'm gon na get drunker . " Ile studied Mary Ashley now , as she sat across from his desk .  | Mary was also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would n't want to have him as an enemy , Mary thought . " You 're aware that you 're being sent to an extremely sensitive post , Mrs. Ashley ? " " Yes , of course , I ? " " Our last ambassador to Romania put one wrong foot forward and the whole relationship exploded in our faces . It 's taken us three years to get back in the door . The President would be damned mad if we blew it again . " If I blew it , he means . " We 're going to have to make an instant expert out of you . We do n't have a lot of time . " He handed her an armful of files . " You can start by reading these reports . " " I 'll dedicate my morning to it . " " No . In thirty minutes you 're scheduled to begin a language course in Romanian . The course usually takes months , but I have orders to push you through the mill . " Time became a blur , a whirlwind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Stickley went through the daily files of the Romanian desk together . " I 'll be reading the cables you send in , " Stickley informed her . " They will be yellow copies for action , or white copies for information . Duplicates of your cables will go to Defense , the CIA , the USIA , the Treasury Department , and a dozen other departments . One of the first issues you 'll be expected to resolve is Americans being held in Romanian prisons . We want their release . " " What are they charged with ? " " Espionage , drugs , theft  --  anything the Romanians want to charge them with . " Mary wondered how on earth one went about getting a charge of espionage dismissed . I 'll find a way . " Right , " she said briskly .  | " Remember  --  Romania is one of the more independent iron curtain countries . We have to encourage that attitude . " " Exactly . " Stickley said , " I 'm going to give you a package . Do n't let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes only . When you 've read it and digested it , I want you to return it to me personally tomorrow morning . Any questions ? " " No , sir . " He handed Mary a thick manila envelope sealed with red tape . " Sign for it , please . " She signed . During the ride on the way back to the hotel , Mary clutched it to her lap , feeling like a character in a James Bond movie . The children were dressed up and waiting for her . Oh , dear , Mary remembered . I promised to take them out to a Chinese dinner and a movie . " Fellas , " she said , " there 's been a change of plans . We 'll have to make our excursion another evening . Tonight we 're going to stay in and have room service . I have some urgent work to do . " " Sure , Mom . " " Okay . " And Mary thought : Before Edward died , they would have screamed like banshees . But they 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grow up . She took them both in her arms . " I 'll make it up to you , " she promised . The material James Stickley had given her was incredible . No - r'onder he wants this right back , Mary thought . There were detailed reports on every important Romanian official , ( rent the President to the minister of commerce . There was a dossier on their sex habits , financial dealings , friendships , personal traits , and prejudices . Some of the reading was lu-  | rid . The minister of commerce , for example , was sleeping with his mistress and his chauffeur , while his wife was having an affair with her maid . Mary was up half the night memorizing the names and peccadillos of the people with whom she would be dealing . I wonder if I 'll be able to keep a straight face when I meet them ? In the morning , she returned the secret documents . Stickley said , " All right , now you know everything you should know about the Romanian leaders . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's something you should bear in mind : By now the Romanians know everything there is to know about you . " " That wo n't get them far , " Mary said . " No ? " Stickley leaned back in his chair . " You 're a woman , and you 're alone . You can be sure they 've already marked you as an easy target . They 'll play on your loneliness . Every move you make will be watched and recorded . The embassy and the residence will be bugged . In Communist countries , we 're forced to use local staffs , so every servant in the residence will be a member of the Romanian security police . " He 's trying to frighten me , Mary thought . Well , it wo n't work . Every hour of Mary 's day seemed to be accounted for , and most of the evenings . Besides Romanian language lessons , her schedule included a course at the Foreign Service Institute in Rosslyn , briefings at the Defense Intelligence Agency , meetings with the secretary of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They all had demands , advice , questions . Mary felt guilty about Beth and Tim . With Stanton Rogers 's help , she had found a tutor for the children . In addition , Beth and Tim had met some other children living in the ho-  | tel , so at least they had playmates ; still , she hated leaving them on their own so much . Mary made it a point to have breakfast with them every morning before she went off to her eight A.M. language course at the Institute . The language was impossible . I 'm surprised even Romanians can speak it . She studied the phrases aloud : Good morning Bunadimineata Thank you Multumesc You 're welcome Cu pldcere I do n't understand Nu inteleg Sir Domnule Miss Domnicoara And none of the words was pronounced the way it was spelled . Beth and Tim sat watching her struggle over her homework , and Beth grinned , " This is our revenge for your making us learn the multiplication tables . " James Stickley said , " I want you to meet your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Bill McKinney wore mufti , but his military bearing was like a uniform . He was a tall middle-aged man with a seamed , weathered face . " Madam Ambassador . " His voice was rough and gravelly , as though his throat had suffered an injury . " I 'm pleased to meet you , " Mary said . Colonel McKinney was her first staff member , and meeting him gave her a sense of excitement . It seemed to bring her new position much closer . " I look forward to working with you in Romania , " Colonel McKinney said . " Have you been to Romania before ? " The colonel and James Stickley exchanged a look . " He 's been there before , " Stickley replied .  | Every Monday afternoon diplomatic sessions for new ambassadors were held in a conference room on the eighth floor of the State Department . " In the Foreign Service , we have a strict chain of command , " the class was told . " At the top is the ambassador . Under him ( under her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deputy chief of mission . Under him ( under her ) are the political consular , economic consular , administrative consular , and public affairs consular . Then you have agriculture , commerce , and the military attache . " That 's Colonel McKinney , Mary thought . " When you are at your new posts , you will have diplomatic immunity . You can not be arrested for speeding , drunk driving , burning down a house , or even for murder . When you die , no one can touch your body or examine any note you may have left . You do n't have to pay your bills  --  the stores ca n't sue you . " Someone in the class called out , " Do n't let my wife hear that ! " " Always remember that the ambassador is the personal representative of the President and to the government of the country to which he is accredited . You will be expected to behave accordingly . " The instructor glanced at his watch . " Before our next session , I suggest you study the Foreign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which talks about social relationships . Thank you . " Mary and Stanton Rogers were having lunch at the Watergate Hotel . " President Ellison would like you to do some public relations for him , " Rogers said . " What kind of public relations ? " " We 'll set up some national things . Press interviews , radio , television ? " " I 've never  --  well , if it 's important . I 'll try . " " Good . We 'll have to get you a new wardrobe . You ca n't pose in the same dress twice . "  | " Stan , that would cost a fortune ! Besides , I do n't have time to shop . I 'm busy from early morning until late at night . If ? " " No problem . Helen Moody . " " What ? " " She 's one of Washington 's top professional shoppers . Just leave everything to her . " Helen Moody was an attractive , outgoing black woman who had been a successful model before she started her own personal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early one morning and spent an hour going through her wardrobe . " Very nice , for Junction City , " she said frankly , " but we have to wow Washington , D.C. Right ? " " I do n't have much money to ? " Helen Moody grinned . " I know where the bargains are . And we 'll do it fast . You 're going to need a floor-length evening gown , a dress for cocktail parties and evening receptions , an afternoon dress for tea parties and lunch parties , a suit for street or office wear , a black dress , and an appropriate head covering for official mournings or funerals . " The shopping took three days . When it was finished , Helen Moody studied Mary Ashley . " You 're a pretty lady , but I think we can do even better for you . I want you to see Susan at Rainbow for makeup and then I 'll send you to Billy at Sunshine for your hair . " A few evenings later Mary ran into Stanton Rogers at a formal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mary and smiled . " You look absolutely ravishing . " The media blitz began . It was orchestrated by Ian Villiers , chief of press relations for the State Department . Villiers was  | in his late forties , a dynamic ex-newspaperman who seemed to know everybody in the media . Mary found herself in front of the cameras on Good Morning America , Meet the Press , and Firing Line . She was interviewed by The Washington Post , The New York Times , and half a dozen other important daily papers . She did interviews for the London Times , Der Spiegel , Oggi , and Le Monde . Time magazine and People did feature articles on her and the children . Mary Ashley 's photograph seemed to be everywhere , and whenever there was a newsbreak about an event in some far-off corner of the world , she was asked for her comments . Overnight , Mary Ashley and her children became celebrities . Tim said , " Mom , it 's really spooky seeing our pictures on the covers of all the magazines . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she felt uneasy about all the publicity . She spoke to Stanton Rogers about it . " Look on it as a part of your job . The President is trying to create an image . By the time you arrive in Europe , everyone there will know who you are . " Ben Cohn and Akiko were lying in bed , naked . Akiko was a lovely Japanese girl , ten years younger than the reporter . They had met a few years earlier , when he was writing a story on models , and they had been together ever since . Cohn was having a problem . " What 's the matter , baby ? " Akiko asked softly . " Would you like me to work on you some more ? " His thoughts were far away . " No . I 've already got a hardon . " I do n't see it , " she teased . " It 's in my mind , Akiko . I 've got a hard-on for a story . There 's something weird happening in this town . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is different . I ca n't figure it out . "  | " Do you want to talk about it ? " " It 's Mary Ashley . I 've seen her on the covers of six magazines in the last two weeks , and she has n't even taken up her post yet ! Akiko , someone is giving Mrs. Ashley a moviestar buildup . And her two kids are being splashed all over the newspapers and magazines . Why ? " " I 'm supposed to be the one with the devious Oriental mind . I think you 're complicating that which is very simple . " Ben Cohn lit a cigarette and took an angry puff on it . " You could be right , " he grumbled . She reached down and began to stroke him . " How about putting out that cigarette and lighting me . . . ? " " There 's a party being given for Vice-President Bradford , " Stanton Rogers informed Mary , " and I 've arranged for you to be invited . It 's on Friday night at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a large , sedate building with a huge courtyard , and was frequently used for diplomatic functions . The dinner for the Vice-President was an elaborate affair , with tables holding gleaming antique silverware and sparkling Baccarat glasses . There was a small orchestra . the guest list consisted of the capital 's elite . Besides the VicePresident and his wife , there were senators , ambassadors , and celebrities from all walks of life . Mary looked around at the glamorous gathering . I must remember everything so I can tell Beth and Tim about it , she thought . When dinner was announced , Mary found herself at a taHe with an interesting mix of senators , State Department officials , and diplomats . The people were charming and the dinner was excellent .  | At eleven o'clock , Mary looked at her watch and said to the senator on her right , " I did n't realize it was so late . I promised the children I 'd be back early . " She rose and nodded to the people seated at her table . " It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was a stunned silence , and everyone in the huge banquet hall turned to watch Mary as she walked across the dance floor and exited . " Oh , my God ! " Stanton Rogers whispered . " No one told her ! " Stanton Rogers had breakfast with Mary the following morning . " Mary , " he said , " this is a town that takes its rules seriously . A lot of them are stupid , but we all have to live by them . " " Oh , oh . What did I do ? " He sighed . " You broke rule number one : No one  --  but no one  --  ever leaves a party before the guest of honor . Last night it happened to be the Vice-President of the United States . " " Oh , dear . " " Half the telephones in Washington have been ringing off the hook . " " I 'm sorry , Stan . I did n't know . Anyway , I had promised the children ? " " There are no children in Washington  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Never forget that . " Money was proving to be a problem . Living expenses were horrendous . The price of everything in Washington seemed to Mary to be outrageous . She gave some laundry and pressing to the hotel 's valet service , and when she got the bill she was shocked . " Five dollars and fifty cents to wash a blouse , " she said . " And a dollar ninety-five for a brassiere ! " No more , she vowed . From now on I 'll do the laundry myself : She soaked her pantyhose in cold water , and then put them  | in the freezer . They lasted much longer that way . She washed the children 's socks and handkerchiefs and underpants along with her bras in the bathroom sink . She spread the handkerchiefs against the mirror to dry , and then carefully folded them so that they would not have to be ironed . She steamed out her dresses and Tim 's trousers by hanging them on the shower-curtain rack , turning the hot water of the shower on full force , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door one morning , she was hit by a wall of steam . " Mother  --  what are you doing ? " " Saving money , " Mary informed her loftily . " The laundry charges a fortune . " " What if the President walked in ? How would it look ? He 'd think we were Okies . " " The President 's not going to walk in . And close the bathroom door , please . You 're wasting money . " Okies , indeed ! If the President walked in and saw what she was doing , he would be proud of her . She would show him the hotel laundry list and let him see how much she was saving by using a little Yankee ingenuity . He would be impressed . " If more people in government had your imagination , Madam Ambassador , the economy of this country would he in a lot better shape than it is . We 've lost the pioneering . spirit that made this country great . Our people have gotten soft . We rely too much on time-saving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like to use you as a shining example to some of the spendthrifts in Washington who think this country is made of money . You could teach them all a lesson . As a matter of fact , I have a wonderful idea . Mary Ashley , I 'm going to make you secretary of the treasury . " Steam was seeping out from under the bathroom door . Dreamily , Mary opened it . A cloud of steam poured into the living room . There was the sound of the doorbell and Beth said , " Mother , James Stickley is here to see you . "  |  | " The whole thing gets weirder and weirder , " Ben Cohn said . He was sitting up in bed , nude , his young mistress , Akiko Hadaka , at his side . They were watching Mary Ashley on Meet the Press . The new ambassador to Romania was saying , " I believe that mainland China is heading for a more humane , individualistic Communist society with its incorporation of Hong Kong and Macao . " " Now what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ben Cohn muttered . He turned to Akiko . " You 're looking at a housewife from Kansas who 's become an expert on everything overnight . " " She seems very bright , " Akiko said . " Bright is beside the point . Every time she gives an interview , the reporters go crazy . It 's like a feeding frenzy . How did she get on Meet the Press ? I 'll tell you how . Someone decided that Mary Ashley was going to be a celebrity . Who ? Whv ' . ' Charles Lindbergh never had a buildup like this . "  | " Who 's Charles Lindbergh ? " Ben Cohn sighed . " That 's the problem with the generation gap . There 's no communication . " Akiko said softly , " There are other ways to communicate . " She gently pushed him down on the bed and moved on top of him . She worked her way down his body , flicking her long , silken hair across his chest and his stomach and his groin , watching him grow hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arthur . " " Arthur wants to get inside you . " " Not yet . I 'll be back to him . " She rose and padded off to the kitchen . Ben Cohn watched her as she moved out of the room . He looked at the television set and thought : That lady gives me shpilkes . There 's a hell of a lot less there than meets the eye , and I 'm damned well going to find out what it is . " Akiko ! " he shouted . " What 're you doing ? Arthur 's falling asleep . " " Tell him to wait up , " she called . " I 'll be right there . " A few minutes later she returned , carrying a dish filled with ice cream , whipped cream , and a cherry . " For God 's sake , " he said . " I 'm not hungry . I 'm horny . " " Lie back . " She put a towel under him , took the ice cream from the dish , and started spreading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! That 's cold . " " Sh ! " Akiko put the whipped cream over the ice cream and then put his penis in her mouth until it became turgid . " Oh , my God , " Ben moaned . " Do n't stop . " Akiko put the cherry on top of his now rigid penis . " I love banana splits , " she whispered . And as she began to eat it , Ben felt an incredible mixture of sensations , all of them wonderful . When he could stand it no longer , he rolled Akiko over and plunged inside her . On the television set Mary Ashley was saying , " One of  | the best ways to prevent war with countries opposed to the American ideology is to increase our trade with them . . . " Later that evening , Ben Cohn telephoned Ian Villiers . " Hi , Ian . " " Benjie , my boy  --  what can I do for you ? " " I need a favor . " " Name it , and you 've got it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ press relations for our new ambassador to Romania . " A cautious " Yes . . . ? " " Who 's behind her buildup , Ian ? I 'm interested in ? " " I 'm sorry , Ben . That 's State Department business . I 'm just a hired hand . You might drop a note to the secretary of state . " Hanging up , Ben said , " Why did n't he just tell me to go fuck myself ? " He made a decision . " I think I 'm going to have to go out of town for a few days . " " Where are you going , baby ? " " Junction City , Kansas . " As it turned out , Ben Cohn was in Junction City for only one day . He spent an hour talking to Sheriff Munster and one of his deputies , then drove a rental car to Fort Riley , where he visited the CID office . He caught a late afternoon plane to Manhattan , Kansas , and a connecting flight home . As Ben @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Was placed from the fort to a number in Washington , D.C. Mary Ashley was walking down the long corridor of the Foreign Service Institute on her way to report to James Stickley when she heard a deep male voice behind her say , " Now that 's what I call a perfect ten . " Mary spun around . A tall stranger was leaning against a  | wall , openly staring at her , an insolent grin on his face . He was rugged-looking , dressed in jeans , T-shirt , and tennis shoes , and he looked scruffy and unshaven . There were laugh lines around his mouth , and his eyes were a bright mocking blue . There was an air of arrogance about him that was infuriating . Mary turned on her heel and angrily walked away , conscious of his eyes following her . The conference with James Stickley lasted for more than an hour . When Mary returned to her office , the stranger was seated in her chair , his feet on her desk , looking through her papers . She could feel the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you think you 're doing ? " The man gave her a long , lazy look and slowly got to his feet . " I 'm Mike Slade . My friends call me Michael . " She said icily , " What can I do for you , Mr. Slade ? " " Nothing , really , " he said easily . " We 're neighbors . I work here in the department , so I thought I 'd come by and say hello . " " You 've said it . And if you really are in the department , I assume you have your own desk . So in the future you wo n't have to sit at my desk and snoop . " " God , it has a temper ! I heard the Kansians , or whatever you people call yourselves , were supposed to be friendly folks . " She gritted her teeth . " Mr. Slade , I 'll give you two seconds to get out of my office before I call a guard . " " I must have heard wrong , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work in this department , I 'd suggest you go home and shave and put on some proper clothing . " " I used to have a wife who talked like that , " Mike Slade sighed . " I do n't have her anymore . " Mary felt her face getting redder . " Out . " He waved his hand at her . " Bye , honey . I 'll be seeing you . " Oh , no , Mary thought . No , you won't.  | The whole morning was a series of unpleasant experiences . James Stickley was openly antagonistic . By noon , Mary was too upset to eat . She decided to spend her lunch hour riding around Washington , getting the anger out of her system . Her limousine was sitting at the curb in front of the Foreign Service Institute . " Good morning , Madam Ambassador , " the chauffeur said . " Where would you like to go ? " " Anywhere , Marvin . Let 's just drive around . " " Yes , ma'am . " The car pulled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see Embassy Row ? " " Fine . " Anything to get the taste of the morning out of her mouth . He made a left turn at the corner and headed for Massachusetts Avenue . " It begins here , " Marvin said as he turned onto the wide street . He slowed the car down and began to point out the various embassies . Mary recognized the Japanese embassy because of the rising-sun flag in front of it . The Indian embassy had an elephant over the door . They passed a beautiful Islamic mosque . There were people in the front courtyard kneeling in prayer . They reached the corner of Twenty-third Street and passed a white stone building with a pillar on either side of three steps . " That 's the Romanian embassy , " Marvin said . " Next to it is ? " " Stop , please ! " The limousine swung to the curb . Mary looked out the car window at a plaque on the outside of the building . It read : MRASSY OF THE SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF ROMANIA . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , please . I 'm going inside . "  | Her heart began to beat faster . This was going to be her first real contact with the country she had been teaching about  --  the country that was going to be her home for the next few years . She took a deep breath and pressed the doorbell . Silence . She tried the door . It was unlocked . She opened it and stepped inside . The reception hall was dark and freezing cold . There was a red couch in an alcove and next to it were two chairs placed in front of a small television set . She heard footsteps and turned . A tall , thin man was hurrying down the stairs . " Yes , yes ? " he called . " What is it ? What is it ? " Mary beamed . " Good morning . I 'm Mary Ashley . I 'm the new ambassador to Rom ? " The man slapped his hand to his face . " Oh , my God ! " She was startled . " What 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were not expecting you , Madam Ambassador . " " Oh , I know that . I was just driving by and I ? " " Ambassador Corbescue is going to be terribly , terribly upset ! " " Upset ? Why ? I just thought I 'd say hello and ? " " Of course , of course . Forgive me . My name is Gabriel Stoica . I am the deputy chief of mission . Please let me put on the lights and some heat . We were not expecting guests , as you can see . Not at all . " He was so obviously in a panic that all Mary wanted to do was leave , but it was too late . She watched as Gabriel Stoica ran around turning on overhead lights and lamps until the reception hall was brightly lit . " It will take a few minutes for the heat to come on , " he apologized . " We try to save as much on fuel costs as we can . Washington is very expensive . " She wished she could have disappeared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . " " No , no ! It is nothing , nothing . The ambassador is upstairs . I will inform him you are here . "  | " Do n't bother ? " Stoica was racing upstairs . Five minutes later , Stoica returned . " Please come . The ambassador is delighted that you are here . Delighted . " " Are you sure that ? ? " " He is waiting for you . " He escorted Mary upstairs . At the top of the stairs was a conference room with fourteen chairs around a long table . Against the wall was a cabinet filled with crafts and sculptures from Romania , and on the wall was a relief map of Romania . There was a fireplace with the Romanian flag above it . Coming forward to greet her was Ambassador Radu Corbescue , in shirt sleeves , hastily pulling on a jacket . He was a tall , heavy-set man with a dark complexion . A servant was hurriedly turning on lights and adjusting the heating . " Madam Ambassador ! " Corbescue cried . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so informally . Your State Department did not notify us that you were coming . " " It 's my fault , " Mary said apologetically . " I was in the neighborhood and I ? " " It is a pleasure to meet you ! A pleasure ! We have seen so much of you on television and in newspapers and magazines . We have been very curious about the new ambassador to our country . You will have some tea ? " " Well , I  --  if you 're sure it is n't too much trouble . " " Trouble ? Of course not ! I apologize because we have not prepared a formal luncheon for you . Forgive me ! I am so embarrassed . " I 'm the one who 's embarrassed , Mary thought . What made Wc do this crazy thing ? Dumb , dumb , dumb . I 'm not even i ; Ding to tell the children about this . It will be my secret till the When the tea was brought , the ambassador from Romania  | was so nervous that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Forgive me ! " Mary wished he would stop saying that . The ambassador tried to make small talk , but that only made the situation worse . It was obvious that he was miserably uncomfortable . As soon as she discreetly could , Mary rose . " Thank you so much , Your Excellency . It was very nice meeting you . Good-bye . " And she fled . When Mary returned to the office , James Stickley immediately sent for her . " Mrs. Ashley , " he said coldly , " would you mind explaining to me exactly what you thought you were doing ? " I guess it 's not going to be a secret I 'll carry to the grave , Mary decided . " Oh . You mean about the Romanian embassy ? I  --  I just thought I 'd drop in and say hello and ? " " This is not a cozy little back-home get-together , " Stickley snapped . " In Washington , you do n't just drop in on an embassy . When an ambassador makes a call on another ambassador @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hell out of Corbescue . I had to talk him out of making a formal protest to the State Department . He believes that you went there to spy on him and catch him off guard . " " What ! Well , of all the ? " " Just try to remember you 're no longer a private citizen ? you 're a representative of the United States government . The next time you have an impulse less personal than brushing your teeth , you 'll check with me first . Is that clear  --  I mean very clear ? " Mary swallowed . " That 's fine . " " Good . " He picked up the telephone and dialed a number . " Mrs. Ashley is with me now . Would you like to come in ? Right . " He replaced the receiver . Mary sat there in silence , feeling like a small child being  | chastised . The door opened and Mike Slade walked in . He looked at Mary and grinned . " Hi . I took your advice and shaved . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two have met ? " Mary was glaring at Slade . " Not really . I found him snooping at my desk . " James Stickley said , " Mrs. Ashley , Mike Slade . Mr. Slade is going to be your deputy chief of mission . " Mary stared at him . " He 's what ? " " Mr. Slade is on the East European desk . He usually works out of Washington , but it 's been decided to assign him to Romania as your deputy chief . " Mary found herself springing out of her chair . " No ! " she protested . " That 's impossible . " Mike said mildly , " I promise to shave every day . " Mary turned to Stickley . " I thought an ambassador was permitted to choose her own deputy chief of mission . " " That is correct , but ? " " Then I am unchoosing Mr. Slade . I do n't want him . " " Under ordinary circumstances , you would be within your rights , but in this case , I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the White House . " Mary could not seem to avoid Mike Slade . The man was everywhere . She ran into him in the Pentagon , in the Senate dining room , in the corridors of the State Department . He wits always dressed in either denims and a T-shirt or in sports clothes . Mary wondered how he got away with it in an environment that was so formal . ( ) ne day Mary saw him having lunch with Colonel McKinney . They were engaged in an earnest conversation , and Mary wondered how close the two men were . Could they be old friends ? And could they be planning to gang up on me ? I 'm getting paranoid , Mary told herself . And I 'm not even ill Romania vet .  | Charlie Campbell , head of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , hosted a party in Mary 's honor at the Corcoran Gallery . When Mary walked into the room and saw all the elegantly gowned women , she thought : I do n't even belong here . They look like they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she looked . There were more than a dozen photographers present , and Mary was the most photographed woman of the evening . She danced with half a dozen men , some married and some unmarried , and was asked for her telephone number by almost all of them . She was neither offended nor interested . " I 'm sorry , " she said to each of them , " my work and my family keep me too busy to think about going out . " The idea of being with anyone but Edward was unthinkable . There could never be another man for her . She was at a table with Charlie Campbell and his wife and several people from the State Department . The conversation turned to anecdotes about ambassadors . " A few years ago in Madrid , " one of the guests recounted , " hundreds of rioting students were clamoring for the return of Gibraltar in front of the British embassy . As they were on the verge of breaking into the building , one of General Franco 's ministers telephoned . I 'm deeply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' he said . Shall I send more police ? ' No , ' the ambassador said , just send fewer students . ' " Someone asked , " Was n't it Hermes who was regarded by the ancient Greeks as the patron of ambassadors ? " " Yes , " came the rejoinder . " And he was also the protector of vagabonds , thieves , and liars . " Mary was enjoying the evening tremendously . The people were bright and witty and interesting . She could have stayed all night .  | The man next to her said , " Do n't you have to get up early for appointments tomorrow ? " " No , " Mary said . " It 's Sunday . I can sleep late . " A little later , a woman yawned . " Excuse me . I 've had a long day . " " So have I , " Mary said brightly . It seemed to her that the room was abnormally quiet . She looked around , and everyone seemed to be staring at her . What on earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two-thirty A.M. And with horror she suddenly remembered something Stanton Rogers had told her : At a dinner party , the guest of honor always leaves first . And she was the guest of honor ! Oh , my God , Mary thought . I 'm keeping everybody up . She rose to her feet and said in a choked voice , " Good night , everybody . It 's been a lovely evening . " She turned and hurried out the door , and behind her she could hear the other guests scrambling to leave . Monday morning she ran into Mike Slade in the hallway . Ile grinned and said , " I hear you kept half of Washington lip Saturday night . " His supercilious air infuriated her . She brushed past him and went into James Stickley 's office . " Mr. Stickley , I really do n't think it would serve the best interests of our embassy in Romania for Mr. Slade and me to try working together . " lie looked up from the paper he was reading . " Really ? What 's the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I find Mr. Slade to be rude and arrogant . Frankly , I do n't like Mr. Slade . " " Oh , I know Mike has his little idiosyncrasies , but ? " " Idiosyncrasies ? He 's a rhinestone in the rough . I 'm offii Tally requesting that you send someone else in his place . "  | " Are you finished ? " " Yes . " " Mrs. Ashley , Mike Slade happens to be our top field expert on East European affairs . Your job is to make friends with the natives . My job is to see to it that you get all the help I can give you . And his name is Mike Slade . I really do n't want to hear any more about it . Do I make myself clear ? " It 's no use , Mary thought . No use at all . She returned to her office , frustrated and angry . I could talk to Stan , she thought . He would understand . But that would be a sign of weakness . I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Daydreaming ? " Mary looked up , startled . Mike Slade was standing in front of her desk , holding a large stack of memos . " This should keep you out of trouble tonight , " he said . He laid them on her desk . " Knock next time you want to come into my office . " His eyes were mocking her . " Why do I get the feeling you 're not crazy about me ? " She felt her temper rising again . " I 'll tell you why , Mr. Slade . Because I think you 're an arrogant , nasty , con-ceited ? " He raised a finger . " You 're being tautological . " " Do n't you dare make fun of me . " She found herself yelling . His voice dropped to a dangerous level . " You mean I ca n't join the others ? What do you think everyone in Washington is saying about you ? " " I do n't really care what they 're saying . " " Oh , but you should . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right you have to be sitting at an ambassador 's desk . I spent four years in Romania , lady . It 's a piece of dynamite ready to explode , and the government is sending in a dumb kid from the sticks to play with it . "  | Mary sat there listening , gritting her teeth . " You 're an amateur , Mrs. Ashley . If someone wanted to pay you off , they should have made you ambassador to Iceland . " Mary lost control . She sprang to her feet and slapped him hard across the face . Mike Slade sighed . " You 're never stuck for an answer , are you ? "  |  | The invitation read : " The Ambassador of the Socialist Republic of Romania requests your presence for cocktails and dinner at the Embassy , 1607 23rd Street , N.W. , at 7:30 P.M. , Black Tie , RSVP 555-6593 . " Mary thought of the last time she had visited that embassy and what a fool she had made of herself . Well , that wo n't happen again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Washington scene now . She put on one of the new outfits she had bought , a black rut-velvet evening dress with long sleeves . She wore black k high-heeled pumps , and a simple pearl necklace . Beth said , " You look prettier than Madonna . " Mary hugged her . " I 'm overwhelmed . You two have dinner in the dining room downstairs and then you may come np and watch television . I 'll be home early . Tomorrow we 're .111 going to visit President Washington 's home at Mount Vernon . " " I lave a good time , Mom . "  | The telephone rang . It was the desk clerk . " Madam Ambassador , Mr. Stickley is waiting for you in the lobby . " I wish I could have gone alone , Mary thought . I do n't need him or anyone else to keep me out of trouble . The Romanian embassy looked completely different from the last time Mary had seen it . There was a festive air about it that had been totally missing on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Gabriel Stoica , the deputy chief of mission . " Good evening , Mr. Stickley . How nice to see you . " James Stickley nodded toward Mary . " May I present our ambassador to your country ? " There was no flicker of recognition on Stoica 's face . " It is a pleasure to meet you , Madam Ambassador . Please follow me . " As they walked down the hallway , Mary noticed that all the rooms were brightly lighted and well heated . From upstairs she could hear the strains of a small orchestra . There were vases of flowers everywhere . Ambassador Corbescue was talking to a group of people when he saw James Stickley and Mary Ashley approach . " Ah , good evening , Mr. Stickley . " " Good evening , Ambassador . May I present the United States ambassador to Romania ? " Corbescue looked at Mary and said tonelessly , " I am happy to meet you . " Mary waited for the twinkle in his eye . It never came . There were a hundred people at dinner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beautifully gowned in dresses by Givenchy , Oscar de la Renta , and Louis Esteves . The large table Mary had seen upstairs on her earlier visit had been augmented by half a dozen smaller tables around it . Liveried butlers circled the room with trays of champagne . " Would you like a drink ? " Stickley asked .  | " No , thank you , " Mary said . " I do n't drink . " " Really ? That 's a pity . " She looked at him , puzzled . " Why ? " " Because it 's part of the job . At every diplomatic dinner party you attend , there will be toasts . If you do n't drink , you 'll offend your host . You have to take a sip now and then . " " I 'll remember , " Mary said . She looked across the room , and there was Mike Slade . She did not recognize him for a moment . He was wearing a dinner jacket , and she had to admit that he was not unattractive in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blonde who was about to fall out of her dress . Cheap , Mary thought . Just his taste . I wonder how many girl friends he has waiting for him in Bucharest ? Mary remembered Mike 's words : You 're an amateur , Mrs. Ashley . If someone wanted to pay you off , he should have made you ambassador to Iceland . The bastard . As Mary watched , Colonel McKinney , in full dress uniform , walked up to Mike . Mike excused himself from the blonde and walked over to a corner with the colonel . I 'm going to have to watch them both , Mary thought . A servant was passing by with champagne . " I think I will have a glass , " Mary said . James Stickley watched her as she drank it down . " Okay . I t ' s time to start working the room . " " Working the room ? " " A lot of business gets done at these parties . That 's why embassies give them . " Mary spent the next hour being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Washington 's most powerful political figures . Romania had become a hot ticket , and nearly everyone of importance had managed to get an invitation to the embassy dinner . Mike Slade approached 1. mies Stickley and Mary , holding the blonde in tow .  | " Good evening , " Mike said genially . " I 'd like you to meet Debbie Dennison . This is James Stickley and Mary Ashley . " It was a deliberate slap . Mary said coolly , " It 's Ambassador Ashley . " Mike clapped his hand to his forehead . " Sorry . Ambassador Ashley . Miss Dennison 's father happens to be an ambassador too . He 's a career diplomat , of course . He 's served in half a dozen countries for the last twenty-five years . " Debbie Dennison said , " It 's a wonderful way to grow up . " Mike said , " Debbie 's been around a lot . " " Yes , " Mary said evenly . " I 'm sure she has . " Mary prayed she would not be seated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ granted . He was at another table , next to the half-naked blonde . There were a dozen people at Mary 's table . Some of them were familiar faces she had seen on magazine covers and on television . James Stickley was seated across from Mary . The man to Mary 's left spoke a mysterious language that she was unable to identify . To her right was a tall , thin , middle-aged blond man , with an attractive , sensitive face . " I am delighted to be your dinner companion , " he said to Mary . " I am an ardent fan of yours . " He spoke with a slight Scandinavian accent . " Thank you . " A fan of my what ? Mary wondered . I have n't done anything . " I am Olaf Peterson . I am the cultural attache from Sweden . " " I 'm very happy to meet you , Mr. Peterson . " " Have you been to Sweden ? " . " No . To tell you the truth , I really have n't been anywhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ places have a treat in store for them . " " Perhaps one day the children and I will visit your country . "  | " Ah , you have children ? How old are they ? " " Tim is ten and Beth is twelve . I 'll show you . " Mary opened her purse and took out snapshots of the children . Across the table , James Stickley was shaking his head disapprovingly . Olaf Peterson examined the snapshots . " They are beautiful children ! " he exclaimed . " They take after their mother . " " They have their father 's eyes . " They used to have mock arguments about which one of them the children resembled . Beth is going to be a beauty , like you , Edward would say . I do n't know who Tim looks like . Are you sure he 's mine ? And their play-argument would end in lovemaking . Olaf Peterson was saying something to her . " I beg your pardon ? " " I said I read about your husband being killed in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very difficult for a woman to be alone without a man . " His voice was filled with sympathy . Mary picked up the glass of wine in front of her and took a sip . It was cold and refreshing . She drained the glass . It was immediately refilled by a white-gloved waiter hovering behind the guests . " When do you take up your post in Romania ? " Peterson asked . " I was told we 'll be leaving within the next few weeks . " Mary picked up her wineglass . " To Bucharest . " She drank . fhe wine was really quite delicious , and everyone knew that wine had a low alcohol content . When the waiter offered to fill her glass again , she nodded happily . She looked around the room at all the beautifully th essed guests speaking in a dozen different tongues and thought : They do n't have banquets like this in good old Junction City . No , sir . Kansas is as dry as a bone . Washington is as wet as a  --  what was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think .  | " Are you all right ? " Olaf Peterson asked . She patted him on the arm . " Great . I 'm just great . I 'd like another glass of wine , Olaf . " " Certainly . " He motioned to the waiter , and Mary 's wineglass was refilled . " At home , " Mary said confidentially , " I never drank wine . " She lifted her glass and took a swallow . " In fact , I never drank anything . " Her words were beginning to slur . " That doesn " clude water , of course . " Olaf Peterson was studying her , smiling . At the center table , Romanian Ambassador Corbescue rose to his feet . " Ladies and gentlemen  --  distinguished guests  --  I would like to propose a toast . " The ritual began . There were toasts to Alexandros Ionescu , the President of Romania . There were toasts to Madam Alexandros lonescu . There were toasts to the President of the United States , and to the Vice-President , to the Romanian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mary that there were thousands of toasts . She drank to every one of them . I 'm a ' bassador , she reminded herself . ' S my duty . In the middle of the toasts , the Romanian ambassador said , " I am sure we would all like to hear a few words from the United States ' charming new ambassador to Romania . " Mary raised her glass and started to drink a toast , when she suddenly realized she was being called upon . She sat there for a moment , then managed to get to her feet . She stood up , holding on to the table for support . She looked out at the throng of people and waved . " Hi , everybody . Having a good time ? " She had never felt happier in her life . Everyone in the room was so friendly . They were all smiling at her . Some were even laughing . She looked over at James Stickley and grinned . " It 's a great party , " Mary said . " I 'm delighted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and turned to Olaf Peterson . " They put somethin ' in my wine . "  | He pressed her hand . " I think what you need is a little fresh air . It is very stuffy in here . " " Yeah . Stuffy . To tell you the truth , I 'm feelin ' a li ' 1 dizzy . " " Let me take you outside . " He helped Mary to her feet , and to her surprise , she found it difficult to walk . James Stickley was engaged in an earnest conversation with his dinner partner and did not see Mary leave . Mary and Olaf Peterson passed Mike Slade 's table , and he was watching her with a frown of disapproval . He 's jealous , Mary thought . They didn ' ask him t ' make a speech . She said to Peterson , " You know his problem , don ' you ? He wan'sa be ambassador . He ca n't stand it that I got the job . " " Who are you talking about ? " Olaf Peterson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's not importan ' . " They were outside in the cold night air . Mary was grateful for the support of Peterson 's arm . Everything seemed blurred . " I have a limousine here somewhere , " Mary said . " Let 's send it away , " Olaf Peterson suggested . " We 'll go tip to my place for a little nightcap . " " No more wine . " " No , no . Just a little brandy to settle your stomach . " Brandy . In books , all the sophisticated people drank brandy . Brandy and soda . It was a Cary Grant kind of drink . " With soda ? " " Of course . " Olaf Peterson helped Mary into a taxi and gave the driver an address . When they stopped in front of a large apartment building , Mary looked at Peterson , puzzled . " Where are we ? " " We 're home , " Olaf Peterson said . He supported Mary as she stepped out of the taxi , holding on to her as she started lo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked . " Of course not , " he said soothingly . " I feel funny . "  | Peterson led her into the lobby of the building and rang for the elevator . " A little brandy will fix you up . " They stepped into the elevator and he pressed a button . " Did you know I 'm a toeteetler ? I mean  --  teetotler ? " " No . I did not know that . " " ' S 's a fact . " Peterson was stroking her bare arm . The elevator door opened , and Peterson helped Mary out of the elevator . " Did anyone ever tell you your floor 's uneven ? " " I 'll have it taken care of , " Olaf promised . He held her up with one hand while he fumbled for the key to his apartment and unlocked the door . They stepped inside . The apartment was dimly lit . " ' S dark in here , " Mary said . Olaf Peterson took her in his arms . " I like the dark , do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure . " You are a very beautiful woman , do you know that ? " " Thank you . You 're a beautiful man . " He led her to the couch and sat her down . She was feeling giddy . His lips pressed against hers , and she felt his hand sliding up her thigh . " What 're you doing ? " " Just relax , darling . It 's going to feel lovely . " It did feel lovely . His hands were very gentle , like Edward 's . " He was a won'erful doctor , " Mary said . " I 'm sure he was . " He pressed his body against hers . " Oh , yes . ' Never anyone needed an operation , they always asked for Edward . " She was lying on the couch on her back , and soft hands had pushed her dress up and were gently massaging her . Edward 's hands . Mary closed her eyes and felt his lips moving down her body  --  soft lips , and a gentle tongue . Edward had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And she wanted it never to stop . " That 's so good , my darling , " she said . " Take me . Please take me . " " I will . Now . " His voice was husky . Suddenly harsh . Not at all like Edward 's voice . Mary opened her eyes , and she was staring into the face of a stranger . As she felt the man start to thrust inside her , she screamed , " No ! Stop it ! " She rolled away from him and fell to the floor . She stumbled to her feet . Olaf Peterson was staring at her . " But ? " " No ! " She looked around the apartment wildly . " I 'm sorry , " she said . " I made a mistake . I do n't want you to think I ? " She turned and ran toward the door . " Wait ! Let me at least take you home . " She was gone . She walked down the deserted streets , bracing herself against the icy wind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was no explanation for what she had done . And there was no excuse . She had disgraced her position . And in what a stupid way ! She had gotten drunk in front of half the diplomatic corps in Washington , had gone to a stranger 's apartment , and had almost let him seduce her . In the morning she was going to be the target for every gossip columnist in Washington. - Ben Cohn heard the story from three people who had attended the dinner at the Romanian embassy . He searched through the columns of the Washington and New York newspapers . There was not one word about the incident . Someone had killed the story . It had to be someone very important .  | Cohn sat in the small cubicle that the newspaper called an office , thinking . He dialed Ian Villiers 's number . " Hello , is Mr. Villiers in ? " " Yes . Who 's calling ? " " Ben Cohn . " " One moment , please . " She was back on the line one minute later . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Villiers seems to have stepped out . " " When can I reach him ? " " I 'm afraid he 's fully booked up all day . " " Right . " He replaced the receiver and dialed the number of a gossip columnist who worked on another newspaper . Nothing happened in Washington without her knowing it . " Linda , " he said , " how goes the daily battle ? " " Plus ( a change , plus c'est la meme chose . " " Anything exciting happening around this gilded watering hole ? " " Not really , Ben . It 's deadly quiet . " He said casually , " I understand the Romanian embassy had a big wingding last night . " " Did they ? " There was a sudden caution in her voice . " Uh-huh . Did you happen to hear anything about our new ambassador to Romania ? " " No . I 've got to go now , Ben . I have a long-distance call . " The line went dead . He dialed the number of a friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through , he said , " Hello , Alfred . " " Benjie ! What 's cooking ? " " It 's been a long time . I thought we might get together for lunch . " " Fine . What are you working on ? " " Why do n't I tell you about it when I see you ? " " Fair enough . My calendar is pretty light today . Do you want to meet me at the Watergate ? " Ben Cohn hesitated . " Why do n't we make it Mama Regina 's in Silver Spring ? "  | " That 's a little out of the way , is n't it ? " Ben said , " Yes . " There was a pause . " I see . " " One o'clock ? " " Fine . " Ben Cohn was seated at a table in the corner when his guest , Alfred Shuttleworth , arrived . The host , Tony Sergio , seated him . " Would you care for a drink , gentlemen ? " Shuttleworth ordered a martini . " Nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a sallow-looking middle-aged man who worked in the European section of the State Department . A few years earlier , he had been involved in a drunk-driving accident that Ben Cohn had covered for his newspaper . Shuttleworth 's career was at stake . Cohn had killed the story , and Shuttleworth showed his appreciation by giving him news tips from time to time . " I need your help , Al . " " Name it , and you 've got it . " " I 'd like the inside information on our new ambassador to Romania . " Alfred Shuttleworth frowned . " What do you mean ? " " Three people called to tell me that she got so stoned at the Romanian ambassador 's party last night that she made a horse 's ass of herself in front of Washington 's who 's who . Have you seen-the morning papers today , or the early editions of the afternoon papers ? " " Yes . They mentioned the embassy party , but there was no mention of Mary Ashley . " " Exactly . The curious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Blaze . ' " " I beg your pardon ? " " Sherlock Holmes . The dog did n't bark . It was silent . So are the newspapers . Why would the gossip columnists skip  | over a juicy story like that ? Someone had that story killed . Someone important . If it had been any other VIP who publicly disgraced herself , the press would have had a Roman holiday . " " That does n't necessarily follow , Ben . " " Al , there 's this Cinderella who comes out of nowhere , is touched by the magic wand of our President , and suddenly becomes Grace Kelly , Princess Di , and Jacqueline Kennedy rolled into one . Now , I 'll admit the lady is pretty  --  but she is n't that pretty . The lady is bright but she is n't that bright . In my humble opinion , teaching a political science course at Kansas State University does n't exactly qualify anyone to be the ambassador to one of the world 's hot spots . I 'll tell you something else that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and talked to the sheriff there . " Alfred Shuttleworth drained the remainder of his martini . " I think I 'd like another one . You 're making me nervous . " " Join the club . " Ben Cohn ordered a martini . " Go on , " Shuttleworth said . " Mrs. Ashley turned down the President because her husband could n't leave his medical practice . Then he was killed in a convenient auto accident . Voila ! The lady 's in Washington , on her way to Bucharest . Exactly as someone had planned from the beginning . " " Someone ? Who ? " " That 's the jackpot question . " " Ben  --  what are you suggesting ? " " I 'm not suggesting anything . Let me tell you what Sheriff Munster suggested . He thought it was peculiar that half a dozen witnesses showed up out of nowhere in the middle of a freezing winter night just in time to witness the accident . And do you want to hear something even more peculiar ? They 've all disappeared . Every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I went over to Fort Riley to talk to the driver of the army truck that killed Dr. Ashley . "  | " And what did he have to say ? " " Not much . He was dead . Heart attack . Twenty-seven years old . " Shuttleworth was toying with the stem of his glass . " I assume there 's more ? " " Oh , yes . There 's more . I went over to the CID office at Fort Riley to interview Colonel Jenkins , the officer in charge of the army investigation as well as being one of the witnesses to the accident . The colonel was n't there . He 's been promoted and transferred . He 's a major general now , overseas somewhere . No one seems to know where . " Alfred Shuttleworth shook his head . " Ben , I know you 're a hell of a reporter , but I honestly think this time you 've gone off the track . You 're building a few coincidences into a Hitchcock scenario . People do get killed in auto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do get promoted . You 're looking for some kind of conspiracy where there is none . " " Al , have you heard of an organization called Patriots for Freedom ? " " No . Is it something like the DAR ? " Ben Cohn said quietly , " It 's nothing like the DAR . I keep hearing rumors , but there 's nothing I can pin down . " " What kind of rumors ? " " It 's supposed to be a cabal of high-level right-wing and left-wing fanatics from a dozen Eastern and Western countries . Their ideologies are diametrically opposed , but what brings them together is fear . The Communist members think President Ellison 's plan is a capitalist trick to destroy the astern bloc . The right-wingers believe his plan is an open door that will let the Communists destroy us . So they 've formed this unholy alliance . " " Jesus ! I do n't believe it . " " " There 's more . Besides the VIPs , splinter groups from various international security agencies are said to be involved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out for me ? "  | " I do n't know . I 'll try . " " I would suggest you do it discreetly . If the organization really exists , they wo n't be too thrilled to have anyone nosing around . " " I 'll get back to you , Ben . " " Thanks . Let 's order lunch . " The spaghetti carbonara was superb . Alfred Shuttleworth was skeptical about Ben Cohn 's theory . Reporters are always looking for sensational angles , Shuttleworth thought . He liked Ben Cohn , but Shuttleworth had no idea how to go about tracking down a probably mythical organization . If it really did exist , it would be in some government computer . He himself had no access to the computers . But I know someone who does , Alfred Shuttleworth remembered . I 'll give him a call . Alfred Shuttleworth was on his second martini when Pete Connors walked into the bar . " Sorry I 'm late , " Connors said . " A minor problem at the pickle factory . " Peter Connors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The two men had met because Connors 's girl friend and Shuttleworth 's wife worked for the same company and had become friends . Connors and Shuttleworth were complete opposites ; one was involved in deadly games of espionage , and the other functioned as a desk-bound bureaucrat . It was this dissimilarity that made them enjoy each other 's company , and from time to time they exchanged useful information . When Shuttleworth had first met him , Pete Connors had been an amusing and interesting companion . Somewhere along the line , something had soured him . He had become a bitter reactionary . Shuttleworth took a sip of his martini . " Pete  --  I need a  | favor . Could you look up something for me in the CIA computer ? It may not be in there , but I promised a friend I 'd try . Connors smiled inwardly . The poor schmuck probably wants to find out if someone is banging his wife . " Sure . I owe you a few . Who do you want to know about ? " " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And it probably does n't even exist . It 's an organization called Patriots for Freedom . Have you heard of it ? " Pete Connors carefully set down his drink . " I ca n't say that I have , Al . What 's the name of your friend ? " " Ben Cohn . He 's a reporter for the Post . " The following morning , Ben Cohn made a decision . He said to Akiko , " I either have the story of the century , or I have nothing . It 's time I found out . " " Thank God ! " Akiko exclaimed . " Arthur 's going to be very happy . " Ben Cohn reached Mary Ashley at her office . " Good morning , Ambassador . Ben Cohn . Remember me ? " " Yes , Mr. Cohn . Have you written that story yet ? " " That 's what I 'm calling you about , Ambassador . I went to Junction City and picked up some information that I think will interest you . " " What kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the phone . I wonder if we could meet somewhere ? " " I have a ridiculously full schedule . Let me see . . . . I have half an hour free on Friday morning . Would that be all right ? " Three days away . " I guess it can wait until then . " " Do you want to come up to my office ? " ' There 's a coffee shop downstairs in your building . Why do n't we meet there ? " " All right . I 'll see you Friday . "  | They said good-bye and hung up . A moment later there was a third click on the line . There was no way to get directly in touch with the Controller . He had organized and financed the Patriots for Freedom , but he never attended Committee meetings , and he was completely anonymous . He was a telephone number  --  untraceable ? ( Connors had tried ) and a recording that said , " You have sixty seconds in which to leave your message . " The number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Connors stopped at a public telephone booth to make the call . He talked to the recording . The message was received at six P.M. In Buenos Aires it was eight P.M. The Controller listened to the message twice , then dialed a number . He waited for three full minutes before Neusa Munez 's voice came on . The Controller said , " This is the man who made arrangements with you before about Angel . I have another contract for him . Can you get in touch with him right away ? " " I don ' know . " She sounded drunk . He kept the impatience out of his voice . " When do you expect to hear from him ? " " I don ' know . " Damn the woman . " Listen to me . " He spoke slowly and carefully , as though addressing a small child . " Tell Angel I need this done immediately . I want him to ? " " Wait a minute . I got ta go to the toilet . " He heard her drop the phone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Three minutes later she was back on the line . " A lotta beer makes you pee , " she announced . He gritted his teeth . " This is very important . " He was afraid she was going to remember none of it . " I want you to get a pencil and write this down . I 'll speak slowly . "  | That evening Mary attended a dinner party given by the Canadian embassy . As she had left the office to go home and dress , James Stickley had said , " I would suggest that you sip the toasts this time . " He and Mike Slade make a wonderful pair . Now she was at the party , and she wished she were home with Beth and Tim . The faces at her table were unfamiliar . On her right was a Greek shipping magnate . On her left was an English diplomat . A Philadelphia socialite dripping with diamonds said to Mary , " Are you enjoying Washington , Madam Ambassa-dor ? " " Very much , thank you . " " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Mary looked at her , not understanding . " Escape from Kansas ? " The woman went on . " I 've never been to Middle America , but I imagine it must be dreadful . All those farmers and nothing but dreary fields of corn and wheat . It 's a wonder you could bear it as long as you did . " Mary felt a surge of anger , but she kept her voice under control . " That corn and wheat you 're talking about , " she said politely , " feeds the world . " The woman 's tone was patronizing . " Our automobiles run on gasoline , but I would n't want to live in the oil fields . Culturally speaking , I think one has to live in the East , do n't you ? Quite honestly now  --  in Kansas , unless you 're out harvesting in the fields all day , there really is n't anything to do , is there ? " The others at the table were all listening closely . There really is n't anything to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and county fairs and exciting classical dramas at the university theater . Sunday picnics in Milford Park and softball tournaments , and fishing in the clear lake .  | The band playing on the green and Town Hall meetings and block parties and barn dances and the excitement of harvest time . . . winter sleigh rides and Fourth of July fireworks rainbowing the soft Kansas sky . Mary said to the woman , " If you 've never been to Middle America , you really do n't know what you 're talking about , do you ? Because that 's what this country is all about . America is n't Washington or Los Angeles or New York . It 's thousands of small towns that you 'll never even see or hear of that make this country great . It 's the miners and the farmers and the blue-collar workers . And yes , in Kansas we have ballets and symphonies and theater . And , for your information , we raise a lot more than corn and wheat  --  we raise honest-to-God human beings . " " You know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very important senator , " James Stickley informed Mary the following morning . " Not enough , " Mary said defiantly . " Not enough . " Thursday morning . Angel was in a bad mood . The flight from Buenos Aires to Washington , D.C. , had been delayed because of a telephoned bomb threat . The world is n't safe anymore , Angel thought angrily . The hotel room that had been reserved in Washington was too modern , too  --  what was the word ? ? plastic . That was it . In Buenos Aires , everything was autentico . I 'll finish this contract and get back home . The job is simple , almost an insult to my talent . But the money is excellent . I 've got to get laid tonight . I wonder why killing always makes me horny . Angel 's first stop was at an electrical supply store , then a paint store , and finally a supermarket , where Angel 's only purchase was six light bulbs . The rest of the equipment was  | waiting in the hotel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Inside the first box were four carefully packed army-green hand grenades . In the second box was soldering equipment . Working very slowly with exquisite care , Angel cut the top off the first grenade , then painted the bottom of it the same color as the light bulbs . The next step was to scoop out the explosive from the grenade and replace it with a seismic explosive . When it was tightly packed , Angel added lead and metallic shrapnel to it . Then Angel shattered a light bulb against a table , preserving the filament and threaded base . It took less than a minute to solder the filament of the bulb to an electrically activated detonator . The final step was to insert the filament into a gel to keep it stable and then gently place it inside the painted grenade . When Angel was finished , it looked exactly like a normal light bulb . Then Angel began to work on the remaining light bulbs . After that , there was nothing to do but wait for the phone call . The telephone rang at eight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listened , without speaking . After a moment a voice said , " He 's gone . " Angel replaced the receiver . Carefully , very carefully , the light bulbs were packed into an excelsior-padded container and placed in a suitcase , along with all the scraps of discarded materials . The taxi ride to the apartment building took seventeen minutes . " There was no doorman in the lobby , but if there had been , Angel was prepared to deal with him . The target apartment was on the fifth floor , at the far end of the corridor . The lock was an early-model Schlage , childishly simple to manipulate . Angel was inside the dark apartment within seconds , standing stock-still , listening . There was no one there .  | It was the work of a few minutes to replace six light bulbs in the living room of the apartment . Afterward , Angel headed for Dulles Airport to catch a midnight flight back to Buenos Aires . It had been a long day for Ben Cohn . He had covered a morning press conference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retiring secretary of the interior , and had been given an off-the-record briefing from a friend in the Defense Department . He had gone home to shower and change , and then left again to have dinner with a senior Post editor . It was almost midnight when he returned to his apartment building . I have to prepare my notes for the meeting with Ambassador Ashley tomorrow , Ben thought . Akiko was out of town and would not be returning until tomorrow . It 's just as well . I can use the rest . But Jesus , he thought with a grin , the lady sure knows how to eat a banana split . He put the key in the lock and opened the door . The apartment was pitch-black . He reached for the light switch and pressed it . There was a sudden bright flash of light and the room exploded like an atomic bomb , splashing pieces of his body against the four walls . The following day Alfred Shuttleworth was reported missing by his wife . His body was never found .  | " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The Romanian government has approved you as the new ambassador from the United States . " It was one of the most thrilling moments of Mary Ashley 's life . Grandfather would have been so proud . " I wanted to bring you the good news in person , Mary . The President would like to see you . I 'll take you over to the White House . " " I  --  I do n't know how to thank you for everything you 've done , Stan . " " I have n't done anything , " Rogers protested . " It was the President who selected you . " He grinned . " And I must say , he made the perfect choice . " Mary thought of Mike Slade . " There are some people who do n't agree . " " They 're wrong . You can do more for our country over there than anyone else I can think of . " " ' ( ' hank you , " she said sobe , ' v. " I 'll try to live up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the subject of Mike Slade . Stanton Rogers had a lot of power . Perhaps he could arrange to have Slade stay in Washington . No , Mary thought . I must n't impose on Stan . He 's done enough already . " I have a suggestion . Instead of flying directly to Bucharest , why do n't you and the children stop first in Paris and Rome for a few days ? Tarom Airlines flies directly from Rome to Bucharest . " She looked at him and said , " Oh Stan  --  that would be heaven ! But would I have time ? " He winked . " I have friends in high places . Let me work it out for you . " Impulsively , she hugged him . He had become such a dear friend . The dreams she and Edward had talked about so often were about to come true . But without Edward . It was a bittersweet thought . Mary and Stanton Rogers were ushered into the Green Room , where President Ellison was waiting for them . " I want to apologize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Stanton has told you that you 've been approved by the Romanian government . Here are your credentials . " He handed her a letter . She read it slowly : Mrs. Mary Ashley is herewith appointed to be Chief Representative of the President of the United States in Romania , and every United States government employee there is herewith subject to her authority . " This goes along with it . " The President handed Mary a passport . It had a black cover instead of the usual blue one . On the front , in gold letters , was printed DIPLOMATIC PASSPORT . Mary had been anticipating this for weeks , but now that the time had come , she could scarcely believe it . Paris ! Rome !  | Bucharest ! It seemed almost too good to be true . And for no reason , something that Mary 's mother used to tell her popped into her mind : If something seems to be too good to be true , Mary , it probably is . There was a brief item in the afternoon press that Washington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explosion in his apartment . The explosion was attributed to a leaky stove . Mary did not see the news item . When Ben Cohn did not show up for their appointment , Mary decided that the reporter had either forgotten or was no longer interested . She returned to her office and went back to work . The relationship between Mary and Mike Slade became steadily more irritating to her . He 's the most arrogant man I 've ever met , Mary thought . I 'm going to have to talk to Stan about him . Stanton Rogers accompanied Mary and the children to Dulles Airport in a State Department limousine . During the ride , Stanton said , " The embassies in Paris and Rome have been alerted to your arrival . They 'll see to it that the three of you are well taken care of . " " Thank you , Stan . You 've been wonderful . " He smiled . " I ca n't tell you how much pleasure it 's given me . " " Can I see the catacombs in Rome ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty scary down there , Tim . " " That 's why I want to see it . " At the airport , Ian Villiers was waiting with a dozen photographers and reporters . They surrounded Mary , Beth , and Tim , and called out all the usual questions . Finally , Stanton Rogers said , " That 's enough . " Two men from the State Department and a representative  | of the airline ushered the party into a private lounge . The children wandered off to the magazine stand . Mary said , " Stan  --  I hate to burden you with this , but James Stickley told me that Mike Slade is going to be my deputy chief of mission . Is there any way to change that ? " He looked at her in surprise . " Are you having some kind of problem with Slade ? " " Quite honestly , I do n't like him . And I do n't trust him ? I ca n't tell you why . Is n't there someone who could replace him ? " Stanton Rogers said thoughtfully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I know he has a magnificent record . He 's served brilliantly in posts in the Middle East and Europe . He can give you exactly the kind of expertise you 're going to need . " She sighed . " That 's what Mr. Stickley said . " " I 'm afraid I have to agree with him , Mary . Slade 's a troubleshooter . " Wrong . Slade 's trouble . Period . " If you have any problem with him , I want you to let me know . In fact , if you have problems with anyone , I want you to let me know . I intend to make sure that you get every bit of help I can give you . " " I appreciate that . " " One last thing . You know that all your communications will be copied and sent to various departments in Washing-ton ? " " Yes . " " Well , if you have any messages that you want to send to me without anyone else reading them , the code at the top of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only one to receive that message . " " I 'll remember . " The Charles de Gaulle Airport was something out of science fiction , a kaleidoscope of stone columns and what seemed  | to Mary like hundreds of escalators running wild . The airport was crowded with travelers . " Stay close to me , children , " Mary urged . When they got off the escalator , she looked around helplessly . She stopped a Frenchman passing by , and summoning up one of the few French phrases she knew , she asked haltingly , " Pardon , monsieur , as sont les bagages ? " In a heavy French accent , he said witheringly , " Sorry , madame . I do n't speak English . " He walked away , leaving Mary staring after him . At that moment , a well-dressed young American hurried up to Mary and the children . " Madam Ambassador , forgive me ! I was instructed to meet you at the plane , but I was delayed by a traffic accident . My name is Peter Callas . I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glad to see you , " Mary said . " I think I 'm lost . " She introduced the children . " Where do we find our lug-gage ? " " No problem , " Peter Callas assured her . " Everything will he taken care of for you . " He was true to his word . Fifteen minutes later , while the other passengers were starting to wend their way through ( ' ustoms and Passport Control , Mary , Beth , and Tim were heading for the airport exit . Inspector Henri Durand , of the general directorate of External Security , the French intelligence agency , watched as they got into the waiting limousine . When the car pulled away , the inspector walked over to a bank of phone booths and entered one . He closed the door , inserted a jeton , and dialed . When a voice answered , he said , " S'il vous plait , dire a Dior que son paquet est arrive a Paris . " When the limousine pulled up in front of the American embassy , the French @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the car window . " My God ! It l ) ok like a riot . "  | Waiting for them inside was Hugh Simon , the American ambassador to France . He was a Texan , middle-aged , with inquisitive eyes in a round face , topped by a wave of brightred hair . " Everyone 's sure eager to meet you , Madam Ambassador . The press has been snapping at my heels all morning . " Mary 's press conference ran longer than an hour , and when it was over she was exhausted . Mary and the children were taken to Ambassador Simon 's office . " Well , " he said , " I 'm glad that 's over . When I arrived here to take up this job , I think it got one paragraph on the back page of Le Monde . " He smiled . " Of course , I 'm not as pretty as you are . " He remembered something . " I received a telephone call from Stanton Rogers . I have life-anddeath instructions from the White House to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you 're in Paris . " " Really life and death ? " Tim asked . Ambassador Simon nodded . " His words . He 's very fond of you all . " " We 're very fond of him , " Mary assured him . " I 've arranged a suite for you at the Ritz . It 's a lovely hotel off the Place de la Concorde . I 'm sure you 'll be quite comfortable there . " " Thank you . " Then she added nervously , " Is it very ex-pensive ? " " Yes  --  but not for you . Stanton Rogers has arranged for the State Department to pick up all your expenses . " Mary said , " He 's incredible . " " According to him , so are you . " The afternoon and evening newspapers carried glowing stories of the arrival of the President 's first ambassador in his people-to-people program . The event was given full coverage on the evening television news programs , and in the morning papers the following day .  | Inspector Durand looked at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as planned . The buildup was even better than expected . He could have predicted the Ashleys ' itinerary during the next three days . They 'll go to all the mindless tourist places that Americans want to see , he thought . Mary and the children had lunch at the Jules Verne restaurant in the Tour Eiffel , and later they went to the top of the Arc de Triomphe . They spent the following morning gazing at the treasures of the Louvre , had lunch near Versailles , and dinner at the Tour d'Argent . Tim stared out the restaurant window at Notre Dame and asked , " Where do they keep the hunchback ? " Every moment in Paris was a joy . Mary kept thinking how much she wished Edward were there . The next day after lunch , they were driven to the airport . Inspector Durand watched them as they checked in for their flight to Rome . The woman is attractive  --  quite lovely , in fact . An intelligent face . Good body , great legs and derriere . I wonder what the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprise . They were well mannered for Americans . When the plane took off , Inspector Durand went to a telephone booth . " S'il vous plait , dire a Thor que son paquet est en route a Rome . " In Rome , the paparazzi were waiting at the Leonardo da Vinci Airport . As Mary and the children disembarked , Tim said , " Look , Mom , they followed us ! " Indeed it seemed to Mary that the only difference was the Italian accents . The first question the reporters asked was , " How do you like Italy . . . ? "  | Ambassador Oscar Viner was as puzzled as Ambassador Simon had been . " Frank Sinatra did n't get this big a reception . Is there something about you I do n't know , Madam Ambassador ? " " I think I can explain , " Mary replied . " It is n't me the press is interested in . They 're interested in the President 's people-to-people program . We 'll soon have representatives in every iron curtain country . It will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's what the press is excited about . " After a moment , Ambassador Viner said , " A lot is riding on you , is n't it ? " Captain Caesar Barzini , the head of the Italian secret police , was also able to predict accurately the places Mary and her children would visit during their brief stay . The inspector assigned two men to watch the Ashleys , and each day when they reported back it was almost exactly as he had anticipated . " They had ice cream sodas at Doney 's , walked along the Via Veneto , and toured the Colosseum . " " They went to see the Trevi Fountain . Threw in coins . " " Visited Termi de Caracalla and then the catacombs . Boy became ill and was taken back to hotel . " " Subjects went for a carriage ride in Borghese Park and walked along the Piazza Navona . " Enjoy yourselves , Captain Barzini thought sardonically . Ambassador Viner accompanied Mary and the children to the airport . " I have a diplomatic pouch to go to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your luggage ? " " Of course not , " Mary said . Captain Barzini was at the airport to watch the Ashley family board the Tarom Airlines plane bound for Bucharest .  | He stayed until the plane took off , and then made a telephone call . " Ho un messaggio per Balder . Il suo pacco e in via a Bucharest . " It was only after they were airborne that the enormity of what was about to happen really struck Mary Ashley . It was so incredible that she had to say it aloud . " We 're on our way to Romania , where I 'm going to take up my post as ambassador from the United States . " Beth was looking at her strangely . " Yes , Mother . We know that . That 's why we 're here . " But how could Mary explain her excitement to them ? The closer the plane got to Bucharest , the more her excitement increased . I 'm going to be the best damned ambassador they 've ever seen , she thought . Before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to be close allies . The NO SMOKING sign flashed on , and Mary 's euphoric dreams of great statesmanship evaporated . We ca n't be landing already , Mary thought in a panic . We just took off . Why is the flight so short ? She felt the pressure on her ears as the plane began to descend , and a few moments later the wheels touched the ground . It 's really happening , Mary thought incredulously . Ito not an ambassador . I 'm a fake . I 'm going to get us into a war . God help us . Dorothy and I should never have left Kansas .  | page deleted  | page deleted  | page deleted  | page deleted  | Costache said . " Welcome to our country . " In a way , Mary thought , it 's going to be my country too . " Mu4umesc , domnule , " Mary said . " You speak Romanian ! " Costache cried . " Cu placere ! " Mary hoped the man was not going to get carried away . " A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Bunadimineala . " And Mary was so proud she could have burst . She introduced Tim and Beth . Jerry Davis said , " Your limousine is waiting for you , Madam Ambassador . Colonel McKinney is outside . " Colonel McKinney . Colonel McKinney and Mike Slade . She wondered whether Slade was here too , but she refused to ask . There was a long line waiting to go through Customs , but Mary and the children were outside the building in a matter of minutes . There were reporters and photographers waiting again , but instead of the free-for-alls that Mary had encountered earlier , they were orderly and controlled . When they had finished , they thanked Mary and departed in a body . Colonel McKinney , in army uniform , was waiting at the curb . He held out his hand . " Good morning , Madam Ambassador . Did you have a pleasant trip ? " " Yes , thank you . " " Mike Slade wanted to be here , but there was some important business he had to take care of . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blonde . A long , black limousine with an American flag on the right front fender pulled up . A cheerful-looking man in a chauffeur 's uniform held the door open . " This is Florian . " The chauffeur grinned , baring beautiful white teeth . " Welcome , Madam Ambassador . Master Tim . Miss Beth . It will be my pleasure to serve all of you . " " Thank you , " Mary said .  | " Florian will be at your disposal twenty-four hours a day . I thought we would go directly to the residence , so you can unpack and relax . Later , perhaps you would like to drive around the city a bit . In the morning , Florian will take you to the American embassy . " " That sounds fine , " Mary said . She wondered again where Mike Slade was . The drive from the airport to the city was fascinating . They drove on a two-lane highway heavily traveled by trucks and automobiles , but every few miles the traffic would be held up by little gypsy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the highway were modern factories next to ancient huts . The car passed farm after farm , with women working in the fields , colorful bandannas knotted around their heads . They drove by Baneasa , Bucharest 's domestic airport . Just beyond it , off the main highway , was a low , blue and gray , two-story building with an ominous look about it . " What is that ? " Mary asked . Florian grimaced . " The Ivan Stelian Prison . That is where they put anyone who disagrees with the Romanian government . " During the drive , Colonel McKinney pointed to a red button near the door . " This is an emergency switch , " he explained . " If you 're ever in trouble  --  attacked by terrorists or whomever just press this button . It activates a radio transmitter in the car that 's monitored at the embassy , and turns on a red light on the-roof of the car . We 're able to triangulate your position within minutes . " Mary said fervently , " I hope I 'll never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too , Madam Ambassador . " The center of Bucharest was beautiful . There were parks and monuments and fountains everywhere one looked . Mary temembered her grandfather saying , " Bucharest is a minia-  | ture Paris , Mary . They even have a replica of the Eiffel Tower . " And there it was . She was in the homeland of her forefathers . The streets were crowded with people and buses and streetcars . The limousine honked its way through the traffic , the pedestrians scurrying out of the way , as the car turned into a small , tree-lined street . " The residence is just ahead , " the colonel said . " The street is named after a Russian general . Ironic , eh ? " The ambassador 's residence was a large and beautiful oldfashioned three-story house surrounded by acres of lovely grounds . The staff was lined up outside the residence , awaiting the arrival of the new ambassador . When Mary stepped out of the car , Jerry Davis made the introductions . " Madam Ambassador , your staff . Mihai , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , your housekeeper ; Cosma , your chef ; and Delia and Carmen , your maids . " Mary moved down the line , receiving their bows and curtsies , thinking : Oh , my God . What am I going to do with all of them ? At home I had Lucinda come in three times a week to cook and clean . " We are very honored to meet you , Madam Ambassador , " Sabina , the social secretary , said . They all seemed to be staring at her , waiting for her to say something . She took a deep breath . " Bung ziva . Mullumesc . Nu vorbesc ? " Every bit of Romanian she had learned flew out of her head . She stared at them , helplessly . Mihai , the butler , stepped forward and bowed . " We all speak English , ma'am . We welcome you and shall be most happy to serve your every need . " Mary sighed with relief . " Thank you . " There was iced champagne waiting inside the house , along with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delicious ! " Mary exclaimed . They were  | watching her hungrily . She wondered whether she should offer them anything . Did one do that with servants ? She did not want to start out by making a mistake . " Did you hear what the new American ambassador did ? She invited the servants to eat with her , and they were so shocked that they quit . " " Did you hear what the new American ambassador did ? She gorged herself in front of the starving servants and did n't offer them a bite . " " On second thought , " Mary said , " I 'm not hungry right now . I 'll  --  I 'll have something later . " " Let me show you around , " Jerry Davis said . They followed him eagerly . The residence was a lovely house . It was pleasant and charming , in an old-fashioned way . On the ground floor were an entryway , a library filled with books , a music room , a living room , and a large dining room , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comfortably furnished . A terrace ran the length of the building outside the dining room , facing a large park . Toward the rear of the house was an indoor swimming pool with an attached sauna , and dressing rooms . " We have our own swimming pool ! " Tim exclaimed . " Can I go swimming ? " " Later , darling . Let 's get settled in first . " The piece de resistance downstairs was the ballroom , built near the garden . It was enormous . Glistening Baccarat sconces lined the walls , which were done in flocked paper . Jerry Davis said , " This is where the embassy parties are given . Watch this . " He pressed a switch on the wall . There was a grinding noise and the ceiling began to split in the center , opening up until the sky became visible . " It can also he operated manually . " " Hey , that 's neat ! " Tim exclaimed . " I 'm afraid it 's called the Ambassador 's Folly , ' " Jerry   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
