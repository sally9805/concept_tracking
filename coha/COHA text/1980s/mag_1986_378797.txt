Imagine that a new work by Giacomo Puccini had been discovered . Opera houses the world over would fight for the rights to the first performance . The best singers would scramble to create the roles . Audiences would line up eagerly . It would be a sensation . <P> Surprise , such a work exists . Except this Puccini opera is not newly discovered , it is being rediscovered . After years of unwarranted neglect , La Rondine ( The Swallow ) may be finding a perch in the major opera houses . La Rondine ( pronounced Ron-dee-nay ) is not yet a repertory staple . But in 1984 the New York City Opera staged a bubbly version that revealed the many charms of the seductive score . Now in Chicago , the renascent Lyric Opera is proving that treated with respect , the little bird can soar . <P> Conceived in 1913 as a Viennese operetta but developed at Puccini 's insistence into a more operatic work , La Rondine has never been considered the equal of such tearjerkers as La Bohme or Madama Butterfly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are held against it , as are its less serious origins . " It has proved the weakest of Puccini 's works , uneasily hovering between opera and operetta and devoid of striking lyrical melody , " wrote Puccini Scholar Mosco Carner in a typical critical assessment . <P> At first the opera does appear to be something of a rewrite . The story certainly recalls La Traviata : Parisian Courtesan Magda meets innocent Country Boy Ruggero , loves him and then , out of concern for his family 's honor , leaves him . And as in La Bohme , there is a joyous caf scene and a secondary pair of quarrelsome lovers . Yet the feel of La Rondine is very different , for Magda is a more worldly-wise heroine than either Violetta or Mimi . Her affair with Ruggero is a self-deluding attempt to recapture a lost moment from her youth , and in the last act , she realizes she has been acting out a fantasy , not conducting a love affair . The opera comes to a close with her wistful sigh floating high above the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a core of cynicism and bears about as much relation to Lehar as Ravel 's fierce La Valse does to the waltzes of Johann Strauss . <P> The score is the work of a master . The irresistible Doretta 's Dream , the opera 's most famous aria , is sung first by the poet Prunier , a sadder , wiser Rodolfo , whose prominence at the opera 's beginning sets the tone for what is to come . The gradual transformation of the lovers ' duet into a full-blown chorus in the second act is a magical lyric moment . There is even wit : a sly quote from Richard Strauss 's Salome when Prunier describes his ideal woman , and a love duet that deliberately recalls the end of the first act of La Bohme . The melodies are supple and strongly defined , and there is none of the manipulative abuse of the heroine that coarsens , say , Butterfly . <P> Aside from a somewhat shaky performance from Rumanian-born Soprano Ileana Cotrubas , who sings Magda , the Lyric 's handsome , glittering production is cast with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Teatro Comunale G. Verdi , it is directed by Giulio Chazalettes , who might have made more of Rondine 's disillusioned subtext and in so doing brought out its richer texture . But as performers gradually realize the opera 's possibilities , harder-edged interpretations will no doubt follow .
