Never has Washington seen such an army march down its old avenues.the soldiers clad in pinstripes and shod in Guccis . Not in all U.S. history have such unusual political alliances been formed as those now taking to the barricades against Ronald Reagan 's budget cuts . From church basements and corporate boardrooms , tens of thousands of special pleaders , lobbyists and their experts have marshaled to do battle for their special causes . It is Chautauqua , the circus , a Greek drama of a thousand acts , running from dawn to midnight , from Capitol hideaways to the Pentagon . <P> The first thing that strikes one is the sameness of dress , manners and mode of all the combatants . Battles for poverty programs and corporate interests alike are camouflaged in three-piece numbers from Brooks Brothers and armed with computer printouts , artful charts and direct mail lists . <P> Lane Kirkland , the delightful panjandrum of labor , rides through the Washington nights in a chauffeured Chrysler limousine , often as not in a dinner jacket , almost always with his cigarette holder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the downtrodden , having assembled 185 organizations into a budget coalition to contend with Ronald Reagan , who does not smoke but who happens to wear a dinner jacket just as often and rides in a chauffeured Cadillac limousine . <P> Within the Kirkland coalition , the phalanxes of the National Wildlife Federation rub elbows with those of the National Low Income Housing Coalition , the Association for the Advancement of Psychology , the Center for Community Change , the National Conference of Catholic Bishops , and Omega Psi Phi Fraternity Inc . Then , too , there is the Food Research and Action Center , whose troops tramped up to the Hill to protest the proposed food-stamp cuts . FRAC , employing 25 lawyers , technicians and persuaders , gets two-thirds of its million-dollar budget from the Federal Government it is now attacking . Uncle Sam is once again caught beating himself over the head . <P> The picture of Nancy Reagan being knocked off balance by a loving orphan was in its way a subtle lobby for yet another cause , Foster Grandparents . Wonder of wonders , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose cantilevered brassiere was the sensation of the movie era that also elevated Ronald Reagan , showed up to plead against changes in children 's programs that she supports . Luscious Liz Taylor , newly svelte , and some weary turtles from the fifth-rate aquarium kept in the Commerce Department basement were enlisted to stave off the budget knife for their respective interests , the arts and sea life . The National Symphony fiddled through Rimsky-Korsakov last week to mellow members of Congress who must vote on endangered federal funds for the arts . Wherever one dines these days in Washington , there is , over the $50 ( for two ) lunches of shad roe or the $100 ( for two ) dinners of partridge , a whole new vocabulary . Men and women who used to cut deals , apply pressure and give each other the treatment now talk about safety nets , marginal tax rates and econometric models . <P> The great moiling confrontation is a testimony of sorts to the energy and health of our democracy . The danger , of course , is that the sum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good , though at this point so many are clamoring , it appears that they all may fail .
