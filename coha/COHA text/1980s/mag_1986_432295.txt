 | Anybody looking for the American theater ? searing new plays , bold new voices ? had better not look on Broadway . The old dream of the Great White Way has turned into a nightmare for American playwrights . Consider this statistic : if you wanted to go see a new American play ( one which opened in 1986 ) on Broadway today , you would have a choice of exactly two : Neil Simon 's " Broadway Bound " or Andrew Bergman 's " Social Security . " Everything else is either a revival ( " Arsenic and Old Lace " ) , a long-running musical ( " A Chorus Line " ) or a British import ( " Wild Honey " ) . If it 's theater you 're after , and the voice of a playwright , the likely place to find it these days is at the movies . The movies ? Look up at the screen this Christmas and you will see a strange , anachronistic sight : theater pieces transferred to celluloid . Beth Henley 's Pulitzer Prize-winning " Crimes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Sissy Spacek and Jessica Lange . Neil Simon 's " Brighton Beach Memoirs . " The hit off-Broadway musical " Little Shop of Horrors . " Julie Andrews in Tom Kempinski 's somber " Duet for One . " And this just caps a year that has been unusually play-heavy . We 've had Mark Medoff 's " Children of a Lesser God , " Marsha Norman 's " ' night , Mother , " William Mastrosimone 's " Extremities , " " About last night ... , " derived from David Mamet 's " SexualPerversity in Chicago . " When you consider that in 1983 not a single American play , not even a Neil Simon , was turned into a movie , the shock of this turnabout sets in . This is no mere fluke . Next year 's schedule continues the trend , from Christopher Durang 's comedy " Beyond Therapy , " which Robert Altman has directed , to Tom Topor 's " Nuts , " starring Barbra Streisand , to Lyle Kessler 's three-character " Orphans . " Nor is it mere coincidence that producers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to write screenplays . Why is this happening now ? Why , just when it seemed action-crazy Hollywood had irrevocably abandoned the loquacious theater ? except for the rare prestige item like " Amadeus " or high-priced soap operas like " On Golden Pond . " Did a lightning bolt suddenly hit Spago and Le Dome , converting hundreds of dealmakers into artistes in the middle of a power lunch ? Do n't bet on it . No , the real reason that dozens of plays are being optioned and scores of starving playwrights are flying into LAX with sharpened pencils can be traced to a shiny rectangle called the VCR . New money : It works like this . The homevideo boom , now just about the largest single source of income for the movie industry , has resulted in a rush of new money being invested in the feature-film business . There is a perception , whether true or not , that filmmaking has become a no-lose economic game , thanks to all the ancillary markets . As a result , more and more movies are being made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the largest number in a decade . And in just the first nine months of this year , production starts were up an astonishing 52 percent over last year 's blistering pace . What this means is that Hollywood is hungry for properties , and the theater has become the logical place to look for both material and pretested writing talent . If you are a producer anxious to keep your costs down , a play has decided advantages : limited casts and sets . The two-character " ' night , Mother " may have bombed at the box office , but it cost only $3 million to make ; the home-video revenues alone should cover more than half of that . And as Paramount production president Dawn @#  | Steel points out , aging audiences want something more sophisticated than tales of horny skateboarders . " You ca n't just make movies for 16-year-olds anymore . The demographics have changed and you need a much more eclectic mix of film . " Jon Denny , coproducer of Beth Henley 's first screenplay , " Nobody 's Fool , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above ? and is often the cart that drives the horse these days . Considering that , it makes sense to do more mature themes , and that 's when you turn to playwrights . " And so we witness the Darwinian spectacle of an expansionary power ? i.e. , Hollywood ? moving in to fill a perceived power vacuum . The retreating force being , of course , the comatose Broadway - rage , which ironically has had to rely more and more on Hollywood star names and mindless fluff to attract crowds . Hollywood mythology is replete with tales of promising New York playwrights succumbing to the big bucks of Lotusland . Back in the " Golden Age , " the studios beckoned legions of stage writers , from Hecht and MacArthur to Clifford Odets ; some settled happily into their new lifestyle , some returned to the presumably higher calling of the theater . But that was another country , and besides , the wench Broadway is dead . For a new generation of writers , for whom Broadway is more hollow than hallowed , the issue is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Unless you are Neil Simon , a playwright has as much chance of getting rich from the theater as winning the lottery . Hollywood is n't just a temptation now , it 's a necessity . John Steppling is a 35-yearold playwright ( " Dream Coast , " " The Shaper " ) who was recently hired to work on the movie " 52 Pick-up . " " I made more money on Pick-up ' than I did in 10 years in the theater , " he says . For " The Shaper , " which was produced all over the country , he made all of $400 . " To go from that to $60,000 was an enormous jump . I was n't in a position to say no . " Wendy Wasserstein sold the paperback rights to her play " Uncommon Women and Others " for a whopping $300 . " I 'm the only person I know who made a three-figure deal , " quips the acclaimed author of " Is n't It Romantic . " Now she is writing a screenplay for Steven Spielberg . Last year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sea " ) was a little-known young playwright from the Bronx . Now he has two films in production . William Morris agent Michael Peretzian specializes in handling playwrights doing screenplays ( among his clients are Henley , Medoff , Steppling and Michael Cristofer ) . He knows there 's little market for straight drama " Unless your name is David Mamet or Sam Shepard , there 's just no avenue for you . How do you earn a living ? I find that the film and television mediums are subsidizing playwrights more than any other institution in the country . " " I want money as much as anyone , " admits Steppling , " but somewhere along the line I made a commitment to be an artist and , as silly as it sounds , that means something to me . Hollywood is corrupting , it 's extraordinarily corrupting to an artist . " Old snobbism : Indeed it is , and yet the old litany of the big bad movies and the pure , good theater can no longer be swallowed whole . For one thing , more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ onstage in the last two decades . And for a new generation of playwrights , who grew up on the movies , the old snobbism is largely irrelevant . " In college I was obsessed by the movies to the point of neurosis " says Christopher Durang , author of the ferocious comedy " Sister Mary Ignatius Explains It All For You . " Indeed , his 1977 play , " A History of the American Film , " is a satirical regurgitation of that obsession . David Mamet puts it even more boldly . " To me the great American art form is the movies . It 's the movies that really express our culture . That 's what throws us all together , as the theater might have at one time but does n't anymore . We all know what Make my day ' means or who E.T . is . " Mamet , the author of " Glengarry Glen Ross , " is one of the few writers who could support himself solely by the theater , but @# @# NEWSWEEK : DECEMBER 15 , 1986 73  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TV . He has written the script for " The Untouchables , " which Brian De Palma has just finished shooting with Sean Connery , Robert DeNiro and Kevin Costner as Eliot Ness . He has also done an episode of " Hill Street Blues , " and he has directed his first movie , " House of Games , " from his original screenplay . " I ca n't write and produce a play a year anymore , " Mamet says . " It 's not any fun . I could do one every three years . And New York does n't want a play a year from me anymore . As I 'm becoming middle-aged , I get nostalgic and wish that it was the ' 30s and that I was Philip Barry ? but wishing does n't make it so . Broadway , which used to be a home for American literature , is no longer , and that 's just the way it is . " Ted Tally ( " Terra Nova " ) is another playwright who debunks the old image of the author lusting after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just about money or even mainly about money . Playwrights want to reach a wider audience . The other thing is that screenwriting is a different kind of storytelling challenge . " At Yale drama school , Tally recalls , " I had it drilled into me that plays are good and movies are evil . It 's not true . Writing is writing . " Loss of control : Still , for most playwrights there is one big drawback in movie work ? the loss of control . In the theater , the writer remains boss . In Hollywood he 's lucky to get his phone calls returned . Michael Cristofer , who parlayed his Pulitzer Prize for " Shadow Box " into film work ( " Falling in Love , " the upcoming adaptation of John Updike 's " The Witches of Eastwick " ) has seen it firsthand . " In the theater , the playwright is God , while in film there 's a big battle that goes on constantly between the producers , the writers , the directors and the studios . And the writer is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mention was the stars , eager to tailor a script to their image . Make that fifth on the list . Even when Hollywood decides to film a prestigious , critically acclaimed play , @# there 's no guarantee the playwright 's intentions will be honored . David Mamet has simply refused to see " About last night .. , " which turns the acerbic romantic point of " Sexual Perversity in Chicago " on its head . Mark Medoff has gone on record with his unhappiness with the movie of " Children of a Lesser God . " The director , Randa Haines , turned to television writer Hesper Anderson to reshape the story into a full-scale Hollywood love story . Beth Henley is one of the lucky ones . Australian director Bruce Beresford was determined to remain faithful to " Crimes of the Heart " from the start . It was Henley who wanted to make changes , relishing the opportunity to open up her play . " I was saying to Bruce , Maybe we should even change this or that to fit the actresses . ' Bruce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , award-winning roles have a special fondness for the playwright 's art . When Horton Foote turned " The Trip to Bountiful " into a film it provided Geraldine Page with her first Oscar , and his screen original " Tender Mercies " did the same for Robert Duvall . John Guare ( " The House of Blue Leaves " ) turned out one of the most dazzling screenplays of the decade in " Atlantic City , " giving Burt Lancaster the role of a lifetime . The stars of " Crimes of the Heart " agreed to reduced fees to see that the film got made . But to fully understand this Broadwayto-Hollywood phenomenon , one should n't forget that primal Hollywood force ? ego . Movie executives may be obsessed with grosses , but they are equally aware of their image , and the benefits of a prestige item on their bios . Quips Denny : " At a cocktail party they can point to Karate Kid Part II ' and " night , Mother .

" Life is easier ' : The question that haunts theater producers is whether their errant writers will ever return to the fold , having tasted the high life and having learned that success or failure does not depend on the drama critic of The New York Times . " I do n't feel threatened , " says Andre Bishop , artistic director of Playwrights Horizons in New York . " The principal love of the writers I know continues to be theater . " But he does worry about the new generation young writers who do n't have real roots in the stage . " I think anything that pays a lot of money and is vaguely glamorous is very impressive to this generation . " The veteran impresario Joseph Papp , of New York 's Public Theater , is less sanguine . " Very few playwrights come back . You get into the California mode , life is easier , you get used to it , you make more money . Why go out of your way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone . " The West Coast has its own prayer : that all this talent will bring a new depth and vitality to the movies . To which the moviegoer can only add : not a minute too soon .
