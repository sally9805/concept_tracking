TURNER &; HOOCH <P> Directed by Roger Spottiswoode <P> Screenplay by Dennis Shryack , Michael Blodgett , Daniel Petrie Jr. , Jim Cash and Jack Epps Jr . <P> Scott Turner ( Tom Hanks ) is a tidy bundle of compulsions , the kind of man who gets off on an improved filing system and looks forward to flossing his teeth . Hooch ( a mastiff named Beasley ) is a messy bundle of sinew and instinct , the kind of dog who lives to wreck your living room and looks forward to sinking his teeth into the necks of people he does n't like . Also , he drools a lot . <P> This is obviously not Lassie Come Home ; it is the odd couple as crime busters . Turner is a small-town detective , an apt occupation for a man of his temperament . He has placed Hooch , the only witness to his former owner 's murder , in protective custody . As the movie 's none-too-ambitious mystery plot unfolds , it is Hooch , ferociously loyal to both his former master and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 's obviously never heard of Miranda rights . Not that he is a one-note character : he introduces Turner to romance with the local veterinarian ( Mare Winningham ) , and in moments of repose he has a watchful sobriety that becomes a comment on the human propensity to rush around needlessly . If food , sex or loyalty is not at issue , what 's all the excitement about ? <P> Hanks , a wonderfully natural and unpretentious actor , may be the only star capable of holding his own against this competition , even stealing a scene or two from his furry friend . In the end , Turner tames Hooch down , Hooch loosens Turner up , and this little nothing of a movie  --  sweeter and smarter than it has a right to be  --  may cheer you on through the , uh , dog days .
