Stuart got it open and slid back . He reached in and unsnapped the harness buckle that held Lt. Jesus Ramirez 's nearly headless corpse . Stuart could see the bits of bone and brains spattered around already covered with fat black flies , and once again he fought to control his stomach . The cockpit seemed literally awash with blood . Stuart got his arms around Ramirez and pulled him onto his shoulder . The body seemed surprisingly light . He lifted and pulled the pilot out of the aircraft , and laid him gently on the sandy creek edge . He swiped ineffectually at the flies , most of which did not even bother to rise from their feast . Stuart spat something bitter onto the beach , took a hurried look behind him , and went back up after Butterworth . Stuart found a small hollow next to the creek for a shelter . There was a fallen tree in front , which gave some concealment from anyone approaching the helicopter . Stuart carried Butterworth to the hollow , and left him . His leg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beneath the thin fabric of the gray flight suit . His face was very pale and sweaty and his hands were cold . Shock , thought Stuart , absently , as he returned to the helo . Soon he had collected the machine gun , the last two belts of ammunition , the splintered first aid box , and the code bag . As he placed the last of these next to Butterworth , he heard the roar overhead of searching aircraft . He looked up , but saw nothing through the dense jungle canopy . " A-Ds , " said Butterworth . " You radioed our position just before the crash , right ? " " Right . Can you see them ? " Butterworth 's eyes were closed . Stuart stood a little , and looked up . He heard the A-Ds return , and this time he thought he saw a flash of metal . He heard the rotors of approaching helicopters . I ca n't see shit ! thought Stuart , fighting panic . What if they ca n't find us ? " Can you see them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , man , I ca n't . And they wo n't see us ! We 've got to do some-thing . " " Smoke grenades . In the bird , under the right seat . Orange plastic can with flotation collar . " Stuart hobbled back to the helo as fast as he could . My leg hurts too , he thought . He heard more helicopters overhead . Stay with me , you guys ! He found the cannister and wrenched it out from beneath the seat , and carried it like a baby hack to the hollow . He unscrewed the cap and dumped out the flares of various types . 1 le found two fatp201tubes of waxed cardboard , marked ORANGE SMOKE . " Butterworth , how do you light these things ? " " You just twist off the cap , and rub the abrasive surface against the top of the flare , like lighting a kitchen match . But you have to get out in the open , first . " " Hey , why , man ? The smoke will rise through the trees . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You think I am going crawling out there among the entire VC army , you are crazy , thought Stuart . Butterworth opened his eyes . They seemed to plead . " Stuart , pull yourself together , and listen . That smoke grenade is especially made to put out a thick smoke , which will lie flat on the sea surface , and point to the downed man . You have to get into the open . " Stuart stopped tearing at the top . Another helo wop-wopped overhead . It seemed farther away . Stuart felt close to tears . " I 'd go if I could , man . I know you 've already done a lot , " said Butterworth , quietly . Stuart felt his body drain of tension , and his head clear . Fuck it , just fuck it , he thought . " I know you would , man . " He stuffed the two smokes in his shirt , drew his .45 , and stepped from the hollow . His left leg felt on fire from the knee down , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straight , and stood . Fuck you , leg , just walk , he thought , as new waves of pain swept upward . Crouching low , with the .45 hanging loosely in his right hand , he began to walk , then jog , up the side of the canyon , following the path of crushed vegetationthe helo had made on the way down . He kept moving his eyes right and left . Come on , VC . Just let me see you before you do it . Stuart grabbed an exposed root , pulled himself over the last steep part , and rolled on his side at the edge of the dry paddy . He set the .45 on the ground , and carefully twisted off the cap of the first flare . He could hear helicopters all around , but none close . He struck the flare head smoothly , as the directions printed on the tube said , and as the flare caught , he tossed it as far as he could into the paddy . A thick coil of orange smoke rose up in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breeze . And it sure did hug the ground . Stuart felt dizzy from the pain in his leg and the exertion . His blurred vision and lightheadedness told him he had suffered a concussion . He sat up and shook his head sharply to clear it . He picked up his .45 and waited.  |p202Stuart  's head snapped up and his eyes opened . The helo was a few feet from the ground , still coming toward him . The rotor wash dissipated the orange smoke and sent bits of straw and dirt stinging into Stuart 's face . Stuart tried to shout , but the roar of the engine and the force of the rotor wash blew the words away unformed . Two men jumped from the chopper as it landed , followed by two more . The first man reached Stuart , and laid his M-14 rifle down next to him . Gently he pried the .45 from Stuart 's hand , unloaded the chamber , and put it back in Stuart 's holster . The act made Stuart feel slightly foolish . The man hauled Stuart to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so . They started toward the helo . Stuart stopped the marine , shouting in his ear over the rotor and engine noise . " There 's a wounded man , and four dead down there , by the downed bird . " The man gave him a thumbs-up , and once again started them toward the helicopter . Another landed behind , and marines poured out to secure a perimeter . Stuart was helped into the marine CH-34 , and made to lie on a stretcher . Almost immediately two marines appeared carrying Butterworth , who was put in a stretcher on the ground , then lifted in beside Stuart . His eyes were once again closed . The marine who had helped Stuart , a black sergeant with Morrow stenciled above his pocket , jumped into the helicopter as it tilted forward for takeoff . He placed a bag next to Stuart , who recognized it as the sealed code bag he was carrying to Danang . All that seemed so long ago . He wondered what time it was ; the inside of the helicopter seemed dark as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the officers ' club . The medical corpsman gave Butterworth a shot of morphine . Butterworthsmiled his thanks . " The other guy in pain ? " Sergeant Morrow looked at Stuart closely . " No , Doc , he 's fast asleep . "  |p203Stuart  woke up in a hospital bed . He felt badly hung over , but knew at once no liquor had caused it . He could n't see well ; the room was fuzzy . He knew he had been awake before , but could n't remember what happened then . His burned shin throbbed , but he knew he had felt that before . He wondered how bad his leg could be ; it had n't felt that bad when he walked in , but the medics seemed pretty concerned . Infection . It moved so quickly in the humid , living heat of Vietnam . Stuart 's own backup medical training had taught him enough about how fast infection moved through burned or punctured flesh into the blood . He knew , but had had no opportunity to dress the wound after the helo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have any sense of the passage of time . The throbbing of his leg provided a pulse , a measure of time , but it could have been once a second or once a year . He felt he should get a grip , swim out of this foggy lethargy , but the effort seemed enormous , and reality illusive . He was in the hospital at Danang . What difference could it possibly make whether he really got his shit together today or next week ? He slept . The throbbing paced him along , through sleeping , waking , and the vague and dreamless state that intervened . It really did n't hurt very much , but then , infection did n't . He wondered whether he would lose the leg . Surely they would have cut off the leg in the hospital if hisp204life were threatened . Suddenly he was fully awake . Suppose they had cut it off ! He knew that he would still have the throbbing even if the leg had been amputated . He sat up , fighting the dizzy sickness , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peered down his body and saw the tent made in the sheet by two feet . He still had both his legs . The throbbing subsided , receded to the edge of consciousness . Stuart lay back , feeling the dizziness back off , and wiped the sweat from his face with the gray sleeve of his hospital garment . Stuart felt his body probe itself , and he became gradually aware of a new sensation : a crawly itching in his left elbow , like the passage of a heavy insect . Risking the dizziness again , he raised and tilted his head and saw a tube in the large vein of his left elbow . Red . Blood . He was receiving a transfusion . He looked upward for the bottle of blood flowing in . He saw none . He refocused carefully on the itching elbow , squinting to clear his blurred vision . The tube ran down , over the side of the bed . The blood ran out , not in . Stuart leaned as far left as he could , but could not see where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a chair , very far away , next to the bed , with a copy of Stars and Stripes spread open on his lap . Stuart realized the bottle must have fallen while the corpsman slept , that his transfusion had thus been reversed . He shouted to awaken the corpsman ; no sound emerged . He raised himself up on his sore left shoulder and bellowed ; a sound like the crushing of dry twigs came out . The corpsman stirred , awakened , and smiled unconcernedly at Stuart . " How you doin ' , sir ? " Stuart croaked , gagged , fell off the fragile rest of his left shoulder . He swallowed , calmed himself a little . Tried again . " The bottle . Transf-trans-fus-ion ? " The corpsman stood up ; suddenly his face was inches away . " There ai n't no transfusion , sir . You do n't need no blood . You 're OK . The surgeon said it was OK to take a pint of yours . That 's what I 'm doing . It 's almost done . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It do n't hurt , sir , does it ? I tried to place the needle real careful , ' cause I thought you were asleep . " Stuart sank deeply into the pillows , and shut his eyes to block out the nausea . " Sir ? "  | " Why , " Stuart croaked . " Why ? " a little stronger . " Well , sir , you 're all right . You 'll be leaving here , maybe tomorrow . The docs said we could take blood from the nonserious casualties , sir , and you got type A , which they need real bad , on account of the new casualties . " " Why ? " Stuart croaked again , once again weak . " Well , gee , sir , we got a bunch of new casualties today , sir , one hundred sixty-three before four o'clock , when I came on . This is the first day the helos could fly in from the western mountains , since Sunday , sir . " Stuart fought to steady his mind . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even the hospital . He forced back the urge to vomit , staring carefully at the light fixture on the ceiling . The room lost its spin , swayed , stopped . Stuart concentrated on making his voice steady , even . " What day is today ? " " Why , Tuesday , sir . " The corpsman 's face held a dumb , puzzled look . " When did I come in here ? " said Stuart , carefully but with newfound confidence in his voice as messenger . The corpsman moved closer , his puzzled face showing more concern . " Sunday night , sir , the day before yesterday . They finished patching you up yesterday morning . " Oh , God , thought Stuart . I thought it must have been weeks . " Are you feelin ' bad , sir ? Should I call the doc ? " Stuart held himself in , eyes closed . A moment only . " No , I 'm OK . Where do these casualties come from ? " " From up north , sir . Near the Laotian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sanh . The fog kept the choppers out for three days . Awful casualties , sir . " Oh my God , thought Stuart , clamping his eyes shut against the face of the corpsman . That 's where Chandler and his men were going after Moser and I took them up the Cua Viet . He felt a tug at his left elbow , a swabbing of cool alcohol . " Donation 's done , sir . I 'll go now . " Stuart could not open his eyes . " You rest , sir . I 'll take this blood down to the lab , and I 'll bring the donation papers for you to sign tomorrow . You 'll feel better then . " The corpsman receded through the great depth of the room as Stuart watched through slitted eyes . The door closed with a soft clang , feltp206more than heard . This is a bad dream , thought Stuart . The throbbing of his leg rocked him to sleep . The following afternoon , Stuart was given a green uniform and boots , then discharged and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His bed was needed for the increasing flow of more seriously wounded and dying from Khe Sanh . Stuart took the transit bus from the hospital in Danang over to the naval installation at Camp Tien Shaw . He felt dizzy and blearyeyedin the violent Vietnamese sun , and his body seemed unbalanced by the stiff bandages on his leg . He knew he should report to somebody , but he could n't quite figure out whom . He knew the ship 's helicopter from the Valley would land at the Tien Shaw pad around four o'clock , to discharge and pick up mail for the squadron . He could think of no reason why the Valley would have left station , especially with a major battle apparently in progress near the DMZ . Then again , he thought , since the Valley with her squadron of CH-34s and her two fully equipped operating rooms was a primary casualty evacuation and treatment ship , the marine aviators would probably be flying day and night to get the dead and wounded out from Khe Sanh , and the ship 's helo would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in front of the main administration building of the camp , his daydream shattered by the realization that the ship 's helicopterhe was relying on to get him back to the Valley lay broken and blood-soaked in the bottom of a ravine somewhere north of Danang . Vivid pictures of the scene , and especially of the bodies of Ramirez and the crew chief , and the three boys in black pajamas , flashed through his mind . He remembered the young marine he had tried to care for , who had died as well . With what seemed to be an audible bang inside his skull , Stuart 's mind cleared . He looked blankly at the admin building . He swayed slightly as his heart slowed , and wiped the streaming sweat from his face . I was so close to death , he thought . The urgent need to report back to the Valley receded rapidly from his mind . Stuart decided to check into the Transient Officers ' Quarters until he could find out for sure where the Valley was and how he was meant to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stuart had his hospital discharge and treatment sheet and his ID , but no one asked to see then . He selected a bunk in an empty four-man room , and took a sponge bath . He locked up his gear , which consisted of a Red ( ' ross shaving kit in ap207plastic pouch he had been given at the hospital , some underwear and socks he had been allowed to buy , and the receipt for David Epstein 's code machine . He put on the second set of jungle greens he had been issued at the hospital , and put the new boots back on over fresh green socks . He checked his .45 , noted it was dirty , decided it was n't very dirty , and put it in the holster on his right hip . He abruptly remembered he would have to reach the Valley or some facility with a medical team tomorrow , to get his dressing changed . " Rebuilt , " the fat burn specialist with the Texas drawl had said , pointing out to Stuart the detailed instructionson the discharge and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back into the foreground . Stuart pushed it away , back down through his brain into the dark . It did n't really hurt very much , and the fat specialist had been very proud of his work . Not even significant scarring , he had drawled . Stuart hated Texas accents . He completed dressing . He wished he could have taken a real shower , but that was out for at least a week , and then only between dressing changes . His body was already sticking to the clean uniform . The heat was impossible to get used to . Only one thing to ease it , he thought , the Stone Elephant for drinks . I can call Hooper from there , tell him what happened . He will know what I should do . Happy hour started at five ; it was only four , but Stuart figured he deserved a head start . Somebody there would have some knowledge of the whereabouts of the Valley . Stuart walked out into the glare , wishing for the dark glasses he had lost in the helo crash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Officers ' Club . The pain in his leg boomed up into his head . Stuart slid onto a stool in the cool , nearly deserted bar . He decided to start with a beer , to see what his doped-up , overslept body could take . He assumed he was doped up ; he still had not read his discharge and treatment sheet . The Vietnamese barman brought a large icy mug of beer . Not so bad , thought Stuart , as half of it slid down his throat and spread out inside of him . His mind drifted back to the crash and the firefight that had left four Americans and three VC dead . Part of his brief battlefield medicine course had been a couple of lectures on the psychological effects of combat . The doctors had listed the various ways otherwise healthy men react to the trauma of killing , watching their comrades die , and fear of pain and death and cowardice.  |p208During  the long minutes or seconds after the helo had crashed and the little VC field team charged firing into the clearing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one who had gotten closest to the aircraft , whose body Stuart looked at after he stopped firing , was no more than three meters from the aircraft when the bullets from the .30-caliber machine gun ripped into him . The slugs from the thirty were not very large , but arriving in large numbers they had the effect of a chain saw , smashing the boy 's face and chest , and leaving one of his arms attached to his shoulder by only a piece of what might have been tendon behind the splintered and exposed bone . Stuart recalled vividly the appearance and position of all three bodies , and he recalled his first feeling while looking at them  --  curiosity . Stuart ordered another beer . When the barman brought it , Stuart looked thoughtfully at his inevitably blank expression . I wonder what he would think if he knew I just wasted three of his brothers ? Or were they his enemies ? Probably would n't give a shit , Stuart decided . You did n't have to know everything in Vietnam to know the Vietnamese did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whatever his race . He sipped the beer and tried to recall what the doctors had said about normal and abnormal reflections upon self as killer . The more intelligent the newly blooded killer , the doctors had said , the more thoughtful , the more introspective , the harder time they would have in understandingwhat their emotions were telling them . The thoughtful ones could never think of themselves as killers , it seemed . Most felt they could kill , but abhorred it as necessary in war and nothing to be proud of . They would disdain and even fear the macho types who swaggered about gleefully , bragging about wasting gooks and taking ears and reveling in the horror of war . If they had to kill , these thoughtful ones , they would have to steel themselves , before and especially after , against the revulsion they would feel about this lowly , animal act . The bar was filling rapidly as five o'clock approached , and the barmen were getting busy . Stuart looked around for familiar faces , and found none . Someone from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure , or at least someone from the Okinawa 's squadron who could tell him what was going on up north . Stuart took a good pull of the cold beer . The medicine taste in his mouth and the sourness in his stomach were disappearing . He suddenly felt good , and wanted to talk to someone . He drank some more of the very cold beer , and realizedp209he was grinning broadly . Something like a chill passed through his mind . He realized that his grin had coincided with a flashback of the firefight , of the gooks going down under his , his machine gun . The grin faded . Stuart knew it would return . He also knew he would talk about it when he saw his friends again . Those bastards had made their decision when they came into the clearing , firing into the downed helicopter full of people , my people . They would have killed us all ( they did kill four out of the six of us , for Christ 's sake ) , so why should I not feel a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Of course it was a normal reaction . Stuart decided he was n't even going to wonder about the lack of remorse . He was n't even going to think about it . You did n't have to love people who tried to kill you . The beer , he realized , was beginning to make him feel a little drunk . He also realized he was grinning again . A heavy hand clamped his shoulder , upsetting his balance . He struggled to retain his perch on the stool . " Hey , Stuart , how 's the gentlemen 's seagoing Navy ? In which off-limits saloon did you get that fine set of black eyes ? You are two days fucking late . " Stuart pushed his head up against the weight of the hand and found himself looking into the grin of Lieutenant Hooper . " Hello , Hoop . I was going to call you . " " Lucky I found you , then . I came over to pick up new weapons and equipment , and decided to vary the venue of at least my earlyeveningdrinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are n't you fighting the hated Cong from the breezy bridge of the Valley ? " Lieutenant Hooper attracted the barman with a great commanding sweep of his arm , and two more cold beers were produced . Stuart told his story briefly , and , it seemed to him , modestly . Hooper shook his head thoughtfully . " You 're one lucky son of a bitch . You 're not supposed to walk away from that sort of ambush . " " Well , the river helped . They could only come from one side . " " Still , they must have thought you all were dead in the chopper or they would n't have come straight in . They probably figured to rob the chopper and the bodies before the whole thing burned . " " Yeah , Hoop . I guess so . " Stuart felt a little queasy listening to Hooper tell him how he ought to be lying gut-shot and burned up in a helicopter skeleton by a steamy riverbank instead of sitting in the Elephant getting drunk . He ordered another round from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the edge off his earlier feeling ofp210triumph . He felt a little mental shrug . Better , he supposed , to be lucky than smart . Hooper suddenly gave a great shout of laughter and belted Stuart on the shoulder , slopping about a third of Stuart 's beer onto the bar . " Hey . What 's the funny part ? " Stuart asked , lifting his sleeve out of the spilled beer . Hooper guffawed again . " I was just thinking you must have shocked the shit out of those dinks when you let fly with the thirty from the middle of a pile of bodies . " Stuart tried to adopt a thoughtful expression , but wound up with half a grin . " They did look a mite surprised . " Hooper laughed again . " Let 's drink up , laddie , then go pick up the new weapons for my unit . " " I have to get back to the Valley . " " Not tonight . The war owes you a little rest . " " Well , maybe , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this dressing changed every day . " " Not to worry . Old Hoop will see you get your dressing changed . " Stuart joined Hooper in the black SEAL team jeep . Stuart felt relaxed from the combination of the slight beer buzz and the easy conversation . Now that he had told someone , someone well equipped to understand , he could begin to feel that the crash and the firefight , and his comparatively minor injuries , were part of the past . The experience would sink in , become part of him . Fuck it , he thought . The war did n't encourage too much introspection . The jeep bounced into the yard behind the nondescript warehouse whose number corresponded to the number on the pickup notice in Hooper'shand . Stuart swung stiffly out of the jeep , allowed the dizziness to pass with both feet on the ground , then followed Hooper inside . The big lieutenant had already organized two civilian clerks , one American and one Vietnamese , who were scurrying around locating his order . Fourteen Stoner System carbines and related spares @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ammunition . These last two were obviously heavy , but in fifteen minutes Hooper and the two clerks had everything sweated into the jeep . " You familiar with this system , Lieutenant ? " the American clerk asked , as Hooper signed the delivery and custody receipts . " Nope , " said Hooper . " Never even seen one of the fuckers . " " Come on around the back , " smiled the civilian . " We 'll show you . Tran , get two guns and some ammo. "  |p211The  two officers followed the skinny civilian around to the back of the long row of warehouses , where there was a trash-choked ravine with steep grown-over sides . The little dead-eyed Vietnamese came through the back door of the warehouse carrying the two black rifles in front of him like cord wood , with an ammunition cannister balanced on top . The civilian took the ammunition off the top of the pile , then handed a carbine to each officer . The weapon was all black , steel and plastic , with no wooden stock at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way , examining it with an experienced eye . " Goddam thing is so light , it feels like a toy , " said Hooper . Right , thought Stuart . The civilian grinned a toothy , country-boy grin . " Oh , it ai n't no toy , " he said . " It 's a real gook splitter . " Stuart winced , and glanced beneath his eyebrows at Tran , who squattedin the dust a few paces away . The Vietnamese clerk 's expression did not register the insult . Probably ca n't hate us any more than he does , no matter what we call them , thought Stuart . The civilian handed each officer a curved thirty-round clip . Stuart 's clip went in easily and locked solidly . " The firing selector is on the right side . Four positions from top to bottom : safe , single fire , stitch fire , full automatic . Try ' em on single fire . Just pick out any old can or box down there . Might even scare out a rat . " Both officers raised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rounds . It sure does n't kick like the M-14 , thought Stuart , though the muzzle jumped a bit . He fired again , splitting a Schlitz can . He was pleased . He had missed the same can on the previous shot . " OK , " the civilian said , holding up his hand , " now let her rip on full auto . " Dutifully the two officers thumbed the selector switches down to the fourth position , sighted , then began firing short , then longer , bursts into the garbage at the bottom of the ravine . The weapons worked smoothly . Cans and other debris bounced around in a satisfying way . The damp evening air held the tangy smells of cordite and warm gun oil . Stuart and Hooper stopped firing when their clips were exhausted . llooper drew the bolt back twice to make sure the weapon was indeed empty , then set it down carefully . " Nice . " He smiled , and gave a low whistle . " It really tears , even with that light ammunition . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The civilian pulled another two clips from the can , picking up Hooper'scarbine . " Whoa ! You ai n't seen the best part ! " Ills grin had becomep212positively lupine , threatened to split his skinny , stupid face . Hooper took the cue . " OK , " he almost growled , " what the fuck is stitch fire gon na do for us ? " He had examined the selector , which made no mention of stitches , giving only choices of S , 1 , 3 , and FA . Hooper shot Stuart a wry look that Stuart read to mean I am sure we could have figured this out , but might as well let the goofy turd have his day . Stuart smiled . The civilian positively beamed , reloaded Hooper 's carbine , and swung it around on the gully . " Now this is really somethin ' . The M-sixteen do n't even have this ! You ready ? " The civilian conspicuously clicked the selector from S through 1 to 3 . " Now , then . This little jewel allows the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trigger . You see how the muzzle kicks up and to the right , same 's any automatic ? Well , you remember that and the good ole stitch switch , and you do n't hardly have to aim the damn thing ! " Neither Hooper nor Stuart spoke . The skinny man seemed almost breathless with excitement . " Well , anyways , you do n't have to aim it like we was taught , takin ' it up to your shoulder and all . You just point it a little low and to the left , and let her rip ! " The civilian chambered a round , pointed into the gully , and pulled the trigger . The Stoner snapped three times in rapid succession and a five-gallon can jumped and fell over . " You see ! " crowed the civilian . " You hit what you aimed at ? " drawled Hooper . " Shore did . You call me a target . " " How about that yellow and green box that says somebody 's peaches ? " Without hesitation , and without lifting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fired . The peach carton tore in half . The clerk cackled , absolutely delighted . " Come on , you boys have a try . I ai n't no trick shot . " He handed the carbine back to Hooper . " Just like takin ' a stitch . " Stuart and Hooper stepped up to the gully and took a few tentative " stitches . " At first the stance felt stiff and awkward , but within a very few minutes and not too far into the next clips the civilian handed out , both officers were able to hit virtually anything they intended . Although the technique was meant to be used at close range against a target the size of a man , Stuart quickly found he could vary his grip on the carbine and therefore the tightness of the three-shot groups . Bottles and cans leaped and died.  |p213Both  officers stopped firing at the end of the third thirty-round clip . Hooper examined the weapon with new interest . " Potent , " he said . Potent indeed , thought Stuart . " You see , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and you let him have a stitch . Now , if he 's closer than you think , or if he 's running at you , your first two slugs prob'ly get him while the third goes high and wide . But if he 's really a little farther away , or if he ai n't comin ' an ' you think he is , then the first one prob'ly goes in the dirt in front of him , while the next two tear him up . You see ? " Hooper looked almost reverently at the Stoner as he handed it to the civilian , who passed it on to the waiting Tran along with the other carbine and the ammunition box . Stuart and Hooper started back for the loaded jeep . Darkness was closing in rapidly now , and Stuart felt sure Hooper would want to get the Stoners unloaded and locked away before beginning the serious evening 's drinking in the bars along Da Lat Street in the ville . The skinny civilian scurried along at their heels , hating to give up the conversation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to shake the civilian 's hand . " Hey , Lieutenant , " the clerk beamed , " another thing the techs mentioned , you see ? You get some green kid , maybe , gets a little buck fever , maybe the first time under fire ? So , maybe , he just pulls the ole trigger and closes his eyes ? The stitch , well , he just lets off three rounds into the trees  --  on full auto , he sprays thirty rounds every which-a-way , leaving him an empty piece , huh ? " A good thought , considered Stuart . Hooper let out the jeep 's clutch . " Potent , hey ? " said Hooper , wheeling the jeep around . " Deadly potent , Hoop , " Stuart responded . Hooper shook Stuart awake . He raised himself from the sweat-soaked cot in Hooper 's quarters , and sat sideways . Jesus . His head and leg throbbed in unison . If they have to cut one off , thought Stuart , it should be the head . Stuart realized he had virtually no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Broken Hand Bar in Da Lat Street . How long had he slept ? " Good morning , asshole , " rasped Hooper . Stuart probed his sore head with his fingers , expecting bruises . " Merry Christmas to you , lloop ! " " Come on , pardner , " Hooper 's voice reflected his own pain . " It'sp214eight o'clock . We got ta get your ass over to the hospital to get that dressing changed , then I 'll drive you to Transient and they will cut you orders back to the Valley . Jesus , my head . " " Any coffee ? " Stuart 's voice was a croak . " Sure . Full breakfast if you want it . But hustle up , it 's down in the mess tent , on the left . I 'll get your gear together , " replied Hooper . Stuart swayed as he got up , bolted out the door , and threw up as discreetly as possible in the ditch outside the hootch . No one seemed to be around . Searching more with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tent and had a considerable breakfast . He felt immediately better , and realized that he really did n't know when he had last eaten solid food . He savored a third cup of rich coffee , and then returned to Hooper 's quarters . Hooper had packed his hospital carryall and was sorrowfully sipping a warm beer . " Ah , old buddy , I love you , but do n't come back too often . " Hooper cracked a painful grin as he swung Stuart 's bag onto the jeep . Stuart wondered briefly why the bag clanked , then forgot about it as he swung his bad leg aboard . Stuart emerged from the hospital he had left less than twenty-four hours before , with a new dressing and a feeling of well-being due to the painkillers he had cadged off the duty medical corpsman . He found Hooper slumped in a pool of sweat in the jeep 's driver seat . " What kept you ? " said Hooper . " Had to pick up your breakfast , " said Stuart , handing Hooper one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cover of the film storage . " Sweet Jesus , " said Hooper as he finished the beer . Stuart opened another as Hooper started the jeep . " Maybe you can come back . " Stuart discovered at the transient desk that he might have to wait several days to get a flight up to Khe Hah , where the marine squadrons were operating a forward base from the carriers , or to one of the dirty , nameless towns along the Cua Viet River into which landing craft were bringing the heavy equipment for what had become a major operation around Khe Sanh . Everything Stuart heard about Khe Sanh sounded bad  --  a short airstrip surrounded by hills on which the marines were dug in , where they were pounded day and night by NVA artillery set up on other hills . Sometimes the marine outposts were overrun , andp215then the enemy brought up his guns and worked over the airstrip itself . Added to this was virtually constant fog and drizzle , which made both air resupply and air strikes ineffective and often impossible . Stuart felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was pointed at Khe Sanh . Once you got started on such a routing , there was no certainty you could just hop off at a convenient waypoint and pick up a returning boat or aircraft . Things tended to get swept along . Things and people . Stuart accepted the flight orders , noted the very low priority assigned to his movement , and rejoined Hooper in the jeep . " You all set , pardner ? " Hooper handed Stuart the last , no-longercoldbeer . Stuart explained . " Bad shit , " said Hooper . " Scuttlebutt is we may be heading north ourselves . Where you supposed to go now ? " " I 'm supposed to go over to the air base , get quarters , then hang around with my low priority for an empty seat going anywhere north . Look , Hoop , I think I 'll go back to the TOQ and try for at least a day or two to catch a ride on one of the squadron 's helicopters if they come down for mail . If that does n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a couple of days . " Stuart hoped his friend would approve . " Seems a'right . I 'll drop you there , but then I got ta turn up at operations to see what nasty little things those desk-bound assholes have dreamed up for me and my Sealies to do . " Well , at least Hooper did n't seem to disapprove , thought Stuart . He suddenly wondered why he cared . He was certainly obeying the spirit of his orders , and if he did catch a ship 's helo , he would be back to his command sooner than if he obeyed his orders to the letter . Nevertheless , in the eleven months since he had received his commission , this was the first time he had varied even slightly from his orders , and Stuart was n't sure how he felt about that . Hooper stopped in front of the TOQ , and Stuart swung stiffly down from the jeep . " ' Bye , Hoop . Thanks for the stimulating evening . " " Not at all , my friend . With your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a SEAL . " Stuart turned to go . " Hey , shooter , do n't forget your gear , " called Hooper . Stuart went to the hack of the jeep to get his bag . He could n't remember why Hooper had thought it so important he have his gear last night . He picked up the hag and it rattled like a bag of steel hones.  | " What 'd you put in here , Hoop ? " " Well , a bottle of Scotch , among other things . I know how dry it gets at sea . " Hooper twisted around in the seat and grinned . " I also disassembled and packed up one of those neat little sewing machines and a couple of clips . " " Hoop ! What the hell am I going to do with that ? " Again , Stuart 's emotions were mixed . " Well , old son , I 'd say that was fairly obvious . If you insist on eschewing the important but admittedly safer contribution to the war effort of the seaborn serving officer to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you 'd best be suitably equipped . " Hooper got down and took the bag from Stuart and carried it inside , thereby seeming to make Stuart 's decision for him . " You ca n't just give it to me , Hoop . " " Not to worry . I requisitioned two more of the little darlings than I need for my team . I made a note of the number , and we 'll lose this one on our very next nighttime walkabout . " Hooper 's grin was gone . " Besides , you 're too good a friend to trust to the vagaries of a fortyfivewhen we know there 's something much better available . " They said their farewells and Hooper left Stuart to study his mixed emotions . Would I see combat again ? How much should one bend the rules in order to survive ? Stuart caught a marine helicopter from the Valley Forge at four o'clock that same afternoon . An hour later he was back " home . " He signed in the .45 he was accountable for , and asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the armory . He then went to his stateroom , washed as best he could , and slept for fourteen hours.  |p217Valley  Forge pushed her bow into the white-capped gray swells of the northern Pacific , straining against the seas like a harness . Stuart looked into the conning tower as Quartermaster First Class Preston turned the chart to show it to him . " Time forty still look good to turn , Preston ? " " Yes , sir . Eastward and home . " Stuart looked out into the cold rain . Off to port was the island of Ie Shima , which guarded the southern approaches to Tokyo Bay . At 1140 , he would turn from his southerly course to 085 , just north of east , the first leg in the great circle course to Long Beach , California , USA . Stuart stood the JOOD watch on the special sea and anchor detail with Lieutenant Commander Donald . Donald had made Stuart his JOOD for all special evolutions , having added entering and leaving port to underway replenishment . Stuart had conned the ship into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said a word . Yokosuka was difficult and dangerous , because of all the traffic going to and coming from Tokyo and Yokohama steaming in the narrow channel . Yokosuka lies seaward of both Yokohama and Tokyo , so to get into Yokosuka , a ship has to make a left turn across all the outbound traffic  --  ships of every nation and type . all going at different speeds in the confined channel . " Coming up on time forty . Mr. Stuart ...  |p218Stuart  walked over to the Captain , who was slumped in his seat and staring at the rain-spattered windscreen . " Captain , the navigator recommends coming left to course oh-eight-five at this time . " " Make it so . " " Aye , aye , sir . Shall we continue at fifteen knots ? " The Captain turned and looked at Stuart . He actually moved , thought Stuart . " What do you think ? " The Captain wore a sardonic expression . Stuart mentally shrugged . " I expect you will want best speed , sir . " The Captain pushed his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , William , and best speed is flank speed . Bring her up slowly to thirty knots , and if she 's handling the seas , thirty-two . If she is n't riding well , call me in my in-port cabin . Bill , set the steaming watch . " The Captain touched his brow in acknowledgment of the two salutes , and left the bridge . " The Captain has left the bridge , " intoned the Quartermaster of the Watch . " All engines ahead full , one-three-five rpms , " said Stuart . " All engines are ahead full , one-three-five rpms , sir , " answered the lee helmsman . " Left ten degrees rudder . " " My rudder is left ten degrees , " answered the helmsman . " Very well , " said Stuart , watching the big ship turn into the easterly breeze , with le Shima on the port beam . " All engines ahead flank , one-five-five rpms . " The lee helm answered , and Stuart gave Fellows , the helmsman for special sea detail , his course . Gradually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knots . The ship twisted a little in the long swells , but felt very good . He took her up to 26 knots , then 28 , realizing he had never before felt the ship at speed , much less driven her . He ordered 30 knots . Bill Donald leaned into the conning tower . " Bos'n 's Mate of the Watch ! " " Yes , sir ! " " Secure the special sea and anchor detail . " " Aye , aye , sir ! " Stuart listened for the keening of the boatswain 's pipe , amplified by the 1-mc public address system . The Boatswain 's Mate of the Watch piped " attention , "  --  a short low note , followed by a long high note , then the low note , and the high note held even longer , then allowed to trail off to nothing . Stuart loved the sound . The boatswain made hisp219announcement , " Now , secure the special sea and anchor detail , set the regular steaming watch , on deck , section three . " Stuart felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under his feet , powering into the open Pacific at thirty knots . Each long swell threw a top of gray-white foam high over the bow and down the flight deck as the ship dropped into the trough , and the ship shook and shuddered as she pushed aside each succeeding crest with raw power . " Lee helm ! Two-five-zero rpms ! " " Two-five-zero , and answered , sir ! " Stuart heard excited chatter and spontaneous applause from the conning tower . The men knew that the ship was now coursing home at major speed , thirty-two knots . Lieutenant Freitag came on the open bridge to relieve Lieutenant Commander Donald . They went over the nav plot and the few remaining contacts on the radar screen . Stuart had been on watch for nearly five hours , first preparing for the exit from Yokosuka and then doing it , but he was in tune with the rush of the carrier through the long swells of the Pacific , and he wanted to stay with it . Donald leaned in to the Quartermaster of the Watch , Quartermaster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Voytek . " " Aye , aye , sir . " " This is Lieutenant Freitag , I have the deck and the conn . " Stuart 's spirit contracted . He wanted to drive , drive the mighty ship on . A particularlylarge wave top bounced off the bow and sent spray all the way to the windows of the bridge . " William , " said Lieutenant Commander Donald . " Yes , sir ? " " When you 're relieved , come to the wardroom . I 'd like a word with you , over coffee and late lunch . " " Aye , aye , sir . Bill . " Ensign Fiedler , the new JO in fire-control division , hauled himself onto the bridge from the port companionway , unaccustomed to the motions of the Valley driving through fifteen-foot swells at thirty-two knots . He slid across the wet linoleum-tiled deck of the open bridge , and saluted Stuart , " Ready to relieve you , sir . " Stuart gave Fiedler the briefing . William sensed that Fiedler shared the electricity of the entire watch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ racing through the real Pacific . Steaming at five to ten knots in the relatively calm waters of the South China Sea seemed a far lesser experience by comparison . Stuart did not want to leave the bridge.  | " Sir , request permission to relieve Ensign Stuart as Junior Officer of the Deck . " " Permission granted , " said Lieutenant Freitag . " Sir , I have been properly relieved by Ensign Fiedler , " said Stuart , with regret . " Roger , Stuart , and thanks , " said Lieutenant Freitag . Stuart joined Donald at one of the outer ring tables . The wardroom was nearly empty . " You handle the deck well , William . " " Thank you , Bill . You 've given me a lot of opportunities . " Donald pushed aside his plate , and motioned to a steward for coffee . William continued to eat his ham steak , which had been dried out under a heat lamp while he was still driving the boat . " Can you handle the Valley , William ? " Donald 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knife and fork together on the plate . " Yes , sir . Yes , Bill , I believe I can . " " So do I. " Donald sipped his coffee . Stuart 's heart raced . " Uh , thank you , Bill . " " And I believe you want it . " " Yes , sir ! I surely do . " Donald reached down under his chair , and brought up a manila envelope . " The old man just signed this , William . Congratulations . " Stuart opened the envelope , slid the letter out , and read it . It was his qualification as Officer of the Deck , underway , with added paragraphs qualifying him for underway replenishment and entering and leaving port . " The whole nine yards , William , " said Lieutenant Commander Donald . Stuart was dumbfounded . OOD , and unrep and sea detail ? " Why , uh , all at once , Bill ? " " Because I 'll be leaving the ship , as soon as we reach Long Beach . " Stuart took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Bill ? " It felt like asking Daddy why he had to go away on your birthday . Donald pushed himself back , and scratched a cigarette from the pack he never seemed to remove from his shirt pocket . " The Valley will be in the yard five months at least , more likely six or seven , the way we 've pushed her this trip . Many officers will be pulled off . Some , like me , because a long yard period is not seen as conducive for advancementfor ship drivers , have asked for reassignment. "  |p221Stuart  felt puzzlement join his feeling of triumph . " What does this mean for me , Bill ? " " Nothing bad . You are a reserve . You will spend time in Long Beach , with your new wife . Your work while in the yard will be excruciatinglydull , but when the Valley rejoins the fleet in five or six or however many months , you will be the premium ship driver , and maybe the only one , so you will have to train the others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you will have a good jacket ; if not , you will have spent much time with something approaching shore duty , and you will have had some fun . " Stuart sipped his tepid coffee . " Could I be transferred off the ship , Bill ? " " Unlikely . This old war lady will likely be pared of almost all regular navy officers , and worse , with respect , of her best petty officers as the yard period progresses . Guys like you , well-regarded USNR types , will form the backbone of the crew that gets this poor old fighter through the yard period and back out to sea . " " What about not-so-well-regarded USNR types ? " Donald smiled . " They remain , William , they remain . But enough of this lugubrious talk of life ashore for many months . " I 'll take it , thought William . Ashore , get the marriage going , look after my Karen , I 'll take it . Still , making OOD has been a goal , and playing the grizzled mariner to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be all bad , either . " When do I go on the OOD Watch bill , Commander ? " Donald grinned . " Luck is with you , William . You can begin tonight , with the Midwatch . As of now , Bill Donald has disappeared from the watch bill . " Stuart almost slumped . The fucking Mid . He had just gotten used to the idea of standing one watch in seven as JOOD ; now it was one in five as OOD . But not a bad trade , he thought . " Aye , aye , sir . " " So get some rest . And , William , congratulations . " Bill Donald extended his hand as he stood . Stuart jumped to his feet . " Yes , sir ! Thank you , Bill . " Lieutenant Commander Donald looked into William 's eyes long enough to make his eyelids twitch . " William , I 'm not your counselor , but I think you might he happiest if you did n't rule out a career with usUs , thought William . Navy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Karenp222and I have plans . Service is service , but then , there is life . " Thanks , Bill , I will keep that thought . " Stuart climbed down the ladders from the Open Bridge after the Morning Watch . He felt tired ; the watch had seemed long . As the Valley had closed the coast of California , shipping traffic became heavier . They had a particularly vexing time with an elusive , faint radar contact that zigzagged in front of the ship at low and inconsistent speed , betraying no set pattern . In the early pink light of dawn , it turned out to be a large sailing yacht , beating toward Los Angeles . She was a lovely sight , with white topsides and teak decks , and the crew waved cheerfully as the carrier hurtled past . The long-range air search radar had picked up the San Gabriel Mountainsduring the midwatch , some two hundred miles out . Stuart knew the visual sighting of land would come in the forenoon ; then the ship would slow to time her arrival in Long Beach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time for the Valley 's entry two days previously , and the ship had radioed the Naval Officers ' Wives Association the arrival time and dock assignment . Stuart hoped that the wives ' group would have reached Karen , and that she would be there to meet the ship . He felt the ache for Karen that had been suppressed for nearly eight months become more painful , more urgent with each passing hour . She is so close , he thought , so close . The last mail he had received in Yokosuka had contained pages of description of the wedding arrangements , and the date she had set , March 2nd . The enthusiasm of her letters infected him ; he looked forward to the marriage as the formal and public affirmation of their love . March 2nd , barely one and a half months away . Stuart stopped at the flight deck and stepped out , enjoying the crisp , damp breeze . He wanted a cigarette , but the smoking lamp was always out on the flight deck , even now , with the gasoline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floated back over his first eleven months as a commissioned officer in the Navy . He thought with affection of Hoop , and Bill Donald , who had done the most to shape his shipboard development . He was , on balance , pleased ; he felt he had developed rapidly from the confused and almost frightened novice who had walked aboard the Valley in June , and who now could drive the ship in all important evolutions , and could run a division . lie thought as well of his three very different trips into the deeply mysterious heart of Vietnam :  |p223the  festival-like foray into cosmopolitan Saigon , shattered by the monk 's self-immolation ; the terrifying but exhilarating run up the Cua Viet River with Moser saving his hide ; and the disastrous helicopter ride to Danang , sudden killing and sudden death . He felt a lingering confusion about what each of the incidents really meant to him , or ought to mean . Stuart ducked back in through the flight deck companionway , and ran down the last two long ladders to the hangar deck . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sea detail , which would be set around 1100 . As he strode forward toward officers ' country , he heard the boatswain 's pipe trilling attention , and calling the relief of the watch . " Now , sweepers , sweepers , start your brooms , sweep down all laddersand passageways , take all trash and garbage to the fantail for dumping . Lifeboat crew of the watch to watch , and mus-ter , on deck , section one . Now , sweepers . " Stuart strode on toward the wardroom , feeling proud and feeling good . Stuart dropped from his bunk and caught the phone on its second ring . He glanced at his watch , 1030 . " Stuart . " " Hey , William , Paul Freitag . The Captain wants to set the Special sea and anchor detail in fifteen minutes . " " OK , Paul . Thanks . " " Do n't forget the uniform of the day is service dress blue . " " Who could forget ? But , thanks . " " See you presently . " Stuart pulled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his locker . He had n't worn it since arriving on the Valley , and it had gotten a fine coating of mildew , but a vigorous brushing the previous evening had cured that . He dressed rapidly , tying his tie three times before he had it right . He had n't tied a tie for eight months . Ten minutes later he stepped onto the bridge . The Valley had slowed to fifteen knots , and the horizon ahead was filled with the vast coastline of greater Los Angeles . The sky was brilliant blue , though smudged with smog over the city itself . The Valley was surrounded by sailboats and other small craft , and the Captain cursed softly each time one got too close to the bow . Stuart got up to date on the navigation plot , laid out right past the breakwater to the long dock on the southern end of the naval station . Stuart noted the wind was logged as east-northeast at ten knots , virtuallyp224perfect for a straight-in landing . Stuart stepped out onto the bridge wing , and confirmed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until both ears are evenly chilled , Lieutenant Commander Donald had told him ; you are then facing the wind . More reliable than any instrument . Stuart watched as the sailors in dungarees and the officers in khaki were replaced by officers and men in dress blues . When Preston reported the sea detail manned and ready , Stuart relieved Lieutenant Freitag . " Captain , I have the deck and the conn . Request permission to slow to ten knots . " " Permission granted , William , " the old man actually smiled , " permissiongranted to take her right the way in . We both hope you wo n't hear further from me until we 're firmly tied up . " " Aye , aye , sir ! Lee helm , all engines ahead two-thirds , zero-sevenfiverpms . " The order was answered . Next Stuart called for maneuvering combination , ready to enter the confined waters inside the breakwater and into the harbor itself . Many senior officers had crowded onto the starboard bridge wing , chattering and getting in the way , but there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Commander Skelly come up together . Donald smiled and gave Stuart the thumbs-up sign . As the ship slid past the light at the end of the outer breakwater , Stuart slowed to four knots , and ordered one prolonged blast of the ship 's whistle , which meant changing occupation , from underway to in port . The long blast rumbled and echoed back to them . As the bow of the Valley passed the inner end of the breakwater , Stuart could see the dock , and the crowd of several thousand people , many waving American flags . I hope Karen is there . If only she could know that it 's me driving ! A railroad crane was already in position to lift the brows across as soon as the ship was in position . " Everything going smoothly , William ? " asked the Captain , softly . He sounds a little nervous , thought Stuart . " Aye , aye , Captain . " I am a little nervous , too , with everybody on and off the ship watching , but this really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " All engines stop . " " All engines are stopped , " answered the lee helm . " Right , five degrees rudder . " Stuart wanted to get the bow pointed in toward the dock early , so he could gradually pull the stern into line with tiny increments of left rudder , and contrary orders of the engines . " My rudder is right five degrees , sir . "  | " Very well . " The bow was swinging nicely , and now was pointed directly at the crane . Stuart estimated the distance to the dock from the bow at three hundred yards . " Rudder amidships . " " My rudder is amidships . " " Left five degrees rudder . Port engine back one-third . " " My rudder is left five , " answered Fellows . " Port engine back one-third , sir , " answered the lee helmsman . Stuart was now conning from the starboard bridge wing , and he was grateful that the chattering senior officers made way for him . The distance to the dock was down to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The wind was now a factor , shoving the bow off to the right , toward the dock . Stuart felt he had the solution just right , a little power into the wind , and the Valley would come to rest against the camels . I bet that crane wo n't have to move ten feet , he thought . " Port engine stop , starboard engine ahead one-third . Rudder amidships . " The big ship glided ever closer , with the starboard engine holding the bow on the wind . When the crane was abreast the forward aircraft elevator , Stuart called all engines stop , and he heard the pop-pop of shot lines being fired , and saw the red padded bolts bounce on the dock to be seized by waiting line handlers . As the first line struck the dock , the Boatswain 's Mate of the Watch piped attention , then announced , " Shift colors ; the ship is moored , " which brought a cheer from the spectators , held back beyond the crane by beribboned sawhorses . The ship still inched forward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and then the heavy hawsers pulled over after the messengers . As soon as the looped ends of the hawsers were dropped over the bollards on the concrete dock , the sailors on the forecastle , the hangar deck , and the fantail began to winch them in , and the Valley came to a complete halt . " Sir ! " called the talker for the boatswain , " the bos'n says the ship is in position . He requests permission to have the forward brow swung over . " " Permission granted , " said Stuart , and sure enough , the crane , its warning bell ringing a welcome , rolled forward about ten feet and dropped the brow . " Captain , request permission to tell Main Control we 're finished with engines . " " Permission granted , " boomed the Captain , pushing himself away from the rail ; then , more softly , " Damn fine landing , son . " " Thank you , sir , " said William , saluting the Captain 's receding hack . Most of the senior officers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to get hold of a pair of binoculars and to search the crowd for Karen . " Bos'n 's Mate of the Watch ? " " Sir ! " " Secure the special sea and anchor detail , set the in-port watch on the quarterdeck . " " Aye , aye , sir ! " The crane had set the forward and after brows in place , and had rolled away on its rails , its bells ringing cheerfully . The crowd surged forward . Stuart watched the people cross the brow , two abreast . Five minutes into the stampede , he spotted Karen , in a blue and white silk dress , her golden hair shining . He waved , but she was not looking up , and did n't see him . He passed the binoculars in to Preston , and made his way quickly down the ladders and onto the hangar deck . The quarterdeck was a small area at the end of the brow , with a highly polished linoleum deck and cordoned off with spotless white rope strung between polished five-inch shells . Standing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deal of attention from the Officer of the Deck , Gordy Mason , and his JOOD , David Epstein , was Karen . She caught William 's eye and rushed into his arms . " Hello , my good love . " " Oh , my God , William , you 're really back . " " Tsk , tsk , Ensign , snogging on the holy quarterdeck ? " said Mason , in a tone of offended piety . " Tea and cookies in the wardroom , Mr. Stuart , " added Epstein . Stuart flushed , but he saw both men were smiling . He led Karen toward the wardroom . " William , when can I take you home ? " whispered Karen , holding tightly to his arm . " In a little while . I just want to show you off for a few minutes , then my department head will let us go . I 'm as anxious as you are , my love . " " You could n't be , " said Karen , with a smile somewhere between sweetness and lust . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so briefly . His throat was tight . " Just a few minutes . " Their lovemaking was urgent , almost violent at first , but it soon subsided to the slower , gentler pace they both preferred . They had beenp227in bed in the furnished apartment with the drapes drawn since early afternoon , and now it was fully dark . William felt incongruously hungry , then he remembered that he had not had lunch . Karen returned from the kitchen with a bottle of champagne and two frosted glasses . William noted that she had abandoned her previous practice of putting on a wrap when walking about , and now moved easily , naked as a wild animal , sensuous beyond any measuring . Karen filled the glasses , and put the bottle on the bedside table . They clinked glasses and toasted . William became more aware of his hunger . Karen put her glass down , and slid toward the bottom of the bed , stroking his belly and then his thighs with her long , strong fingers . She bowed her head , and kissed his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a jolt as he realized she had taken his limp penis into her mouth . He was shocked and delighted , frightened and ecstatic , as he sprang to full and fat erection . Will I hurt her , he thought ? He raised his head from the neck , and saw Karen rolling her tongue around his shaft , across the swollen tip . Her eyes were closed ; a moan escaped her lips . He threw back his head onto the pillow , and came violently , grasping Karen 's golden head and calling her name . Karen knelt between his legs , her head on his stomach , cradled in his caressing hands . After minutes of silence , she crawled up his chest and kissed him . " Umm , " she said . " That was a surprise . A nice surprise , " said William , his voice weak and his breath short . Karen rose up , and looked at him quizzically , " Surprise ? " William stroked her hair . " You never did that before . " Again , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , love . Did n't you like it ? " " I loved it , my love , I love everything about you . " She gave him a mocking look , and settled her head back on his chest . A tiny doubt gnawed at his brain . He was sure he had never asked her to do that . Could she have perhaps ? . . . He drove the thought away . It was disloyal to his love , and unwelcome in his own mind . It is just so good to be home.  |p228Bobby  Coles pushed himself to master all of the skills of a marine , even as he taught new boots the advanced infantry training course . He told himself he was not doing it to compensate for living out his life as a marine playing football . He just wanted to be the best prepared in case they changed his assignment . He himself had been sent to a steady stream of special schools . He had been to a school in battlefield medicine , really just advanced first aid with special attention to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care of patients suffering from shock . He took a course in spotting artillery and air strikes . He had asked for parachute training , but the Topkick said he had to wait until the end of the football season , since the course took three full weeks out at Twentynine Palms , and worse , might cause an injury . So Coles learned , and taught , and practiced , and played football . The team continued to win , and Bobby felt that the men were playing better as a team , especially the defense . In the last two games , neither March Air Force Base nor San Diego Naval Station had scored a touchdown . And then the word came down that the camp commandant had been given his third star , and ordered to take up a job in the office of the commandant of the Marine Corps in Washington . The new camp commandant was a young-looking major general who had been deputy commander of ' the 3d Marine Amphibious Force in Danang.  |p229The  day after General Dowd took over , the team had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the general came to watch . The joke in the locker room was how do we make ourselves inconspicuous and win a football game at the same time . The men were far too nervous to laugh . No one knew how the new commandant would react to discoveringhe owned a team of ringers , kept on at Pendleton long after their training programs had been completed . The pessimists assumed that since the general was a Vietnam vet , he probably thought everyone should be one . Sergeant Major Jackson told them just to quit bitching and win the fucking game . The players shrugged and filed onto the sunlit field . Bobby saw the new commandant for the first time , saluting as the " Star-Spangled Banner " was played . Morituri to salutamus , thought Bobby , holding his hand salute against his football helmet . Pendleton won the toss and received the kickoff . After two ineffective running plays , the quarterback , a new kid who had flunked out of Oregon State but who really had an arm , threw a bullet to a fleet black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starting position at tight end . The ball bounced off Motor 's shoulder pad and into the arms of a Miramar linebacker . Touchdown . Shit , thought Coles , the offense is so tight it squeaks . Pendleton received the kickoff again , and once again they failed to move the ball . Coles went in on fourth down and punted , a good , long spiral . Miramar started on offense from their own thirty-seven , and at last Pendleton got to play defense . It seemed to Coles that the defense was as loose as the offense had been tight . The major strength of the defense was a corps of very fast , strong , and aggressive linebackers . The best of the bunch was a black marine named Lee from Midland , Texas , whom Bobby had come to like . Lee was into the Miramar backfield before the handoff from the quarterback to the tailback was quite completed , and his tackle drove the tailback hard into the ground . The second play was a reverse , which fooled no one on the Pendleton defense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and eighteen , estimated Bobby , watching the linebackersin front of him shifting in and out between the down linemen as the Miramar quarterback called his signals . If they had had a commentator from a network , thought Bobby , he would have said that Pendleton was " showing blitz . " Bobby smiled as the count continued . That quarterbackis about to be well and truly welcomed to Camp Pendleton . The ball was snapped and the quarterback fled from the onrushing linemen and linebackers . Bobby worked in his zone , keeping an eyep230on the rest of the coverage . The wide receiver on this side would be Bobby 's responsibility , and , as the man feinted out and then turned in , the ball was thrown , hard and accurately . Bobby had to stretch full length , diving over the receiver , to knock the ball down . The receiver grumbled something about interference , and Bobby growled that the pussy should play the whistle . The apathetic crowd of off-duty marines and their wives and girlfriends began to make a little noise . Fourth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Bobby stayed on the field to catch the punt . Punting and catching punts were things he had never done in college , but he liked them . Besides , he knew a lot of young prospects clung to their pro teams through the first few difficult years of adjustment by playing well on special teams . The kick was short , and very high , so Bobby had to make a fair catch . The offense would have the ball on their own forty-five . Bobby met the quarterback as he trotted out , and stopped him , putting his hands on his shoulder pads . " Just play loose , Lawrence . If the commandantdoes n't like ringers , he sure is n't likely to like ringers who do n't win ! " Lawrence grinned . " You fuckers just keep backin ' ' em up ; we 'll get it in . " They exchanged a hand slap and Bobby left the field . Now he watched the offense begin to play . Lawrence opened up immediately with quick , short passes , mostly timing patterns , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ downs , then a four-yard run for the six . Bobby sat on the bench , getting cold . Lee sat beside him , watching intently . " Offense looks good , Bro . " " Yeah , " said Bobby . " They loose , now . " " They had a meeting while you was catchin ' that punt . They decided that if the new commandant decides to dump the team , it was n't gon na be ' cause the team was n't good . " Bobby smiled , and his spirits picked up . " Defense ought a go out in a blaze of glory , then , too , hey Bro ? " Lee butted his helmet against Bobby 's . His smile was frightening ; he was missing about eight teeth in the middle of his mouth . " Right , mothafucka . Offense , that big guard from Grambling , say they gon na cover the spread by halftime . " Coles had heard that Pendleton was favored by the bettors by a spread of ten points . " So what do we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , running and passing , less than a hundred yards , the whole fuckin ' game . " Ambitious , thought Coles . During the last game with Miramar , theirp231quarterback had completed passes for close to two hundred yards and two touchdowns , and they had a good running tailback . " Why not , Bro ? Let 's get ' em . " Pendleton 's place kicker had kicked the ball out of the end zone , and Miramar would start from the twenty . Lee and Coles and the rest of the defense trotted onto the field . Lee punched Bobby 's arm , hard . " Bro , you know what this strategy mean ? " Bobby laughed . " Yeah , it means you front horses are going to be swarming and blitzing all day . " " Right , and it mean any fuckin ' ball that motherless white boy manage to squeeze past us got ta be caught , or knocked down , by you brave fuckas back here . " Lee pointed at the ground at Bobby 's feet for emphasis . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the safeties will do the rest , " said Bobby , now very much into the spirit of the game . " Right , " said Lee , as Miramar broke the huddle with a loud clap and came to the line of scrimmage . Pendleton controlled the game through ferocious intensity . The score was 21  --  7 at halftime , so the offense made good its boast . Miramar managed total offense of 118 yards , so the defense came up a little short , but no one held it against them . The final score was 38  --  10 . The players laughed and slapped and frolicked in the showers like a highschoolteam that had just won a state championship . The commandant received congratulations from the admiral who commanded NAS Miramar , a little coolly , the admiral later remarked . The commandant asked the base personnel officer , Lieutenant Colonel Rogers , seated behind him in the stands , where in his command had all these fine football players come from . Colonel Rogers answered that they were nearly all from the training command . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any harder to keep expression out of his face , he might just as well have blushed . When he returned to his office , he placed a call to Colonel Emrite , head of the training command , and congratulated him on the fine play of so many of his instructors . Colonel Emrite thanked the general . The commandant then invited the colonel to dinner , asking him to bring with him the service records of all of the players on the team who were attached to his command.  |p232Colonel  Emrite sat in the commandant 's tiny den , trying to appear relaxed , as the commandant leafed through the last of the service records . The general had a snifter of brandy and a cigar in an ashtray next to him . He occasionally puffed at the cigar , but had barely sipped the fine cognac . Emrite had long since finished his brandy and wanted another . The commandant set the last of the records aside , took a tiny sip of brandy , and looked at the colonel over his reading glasses . " Mike , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most with some college , three college graduates . " The general paused , but Emrite did not feel it was the time to speak . The commandant continued , " Well trained , even over trained , mostly noncoms , even sergeants , all with combat MOSs , and they 're all in your command , and they 're a superb , even professional quality , football team . " Once again the general paused and Emrite waited . " Does n't that strike you as odd , given , Mike , that there is a nasty little war on ? " The general 's voice was soft , but the colonel heard an edge of sarcasm , and he felt his face redden . " Why were n't these men deployed when their units were , Mike ? Instructors should n't be that hard to attract from among more seasoned NCOs . " Emrite took in his breath slowly . Surely the general had figured out that this scheme had n't originated with training command . " General , these men were kept here at Pendleton to play football @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You signed the orders that these men be transferred from departing units into your command . " So that 's it . " Yes , sir , I did . " The general took off the half glasses and massaged his nose . Emrite felt sweat trickling underneath his gabardine shirt , although the room was cold . The general leaned back in his chair , his cigar in one hand , the other tapping ominously on the stack of service records on the table beside him . " Colonel Emrite , I want you to know that if your answers to those two questions had been anything , anything , other than the ones you just gave , I would have had you out of my command , and even out of the Marine Corps . Do we understand each other ? " Emrite 's throat was so dry he croaked . " Yes , General . " The commandant rose . " Give me your glass , Mike . I 'm going toneed your advice as to how to unwind this mess without causing embarrassmentto , ah , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sudden smile to his face , and held out his brandy glass to he tilled . The general poured slowly , and Emrite willed his hand not to shake.  |p233The  general sat , and resumed . " My predecessor took a great interest in the team , I 'm told . " " Yes , sir , he did . I believe , sir , he felt a winning team enhanced the prestige of the camp . " The general laughed , a loud , single bark . It was so unexpected , it made Emrite jump . " Shit , Mike , I 've just admired your courage and forthrightness . Do n't get political with me and ruin the favorable impression I have of you . " The colonel leaned back , and smiled weakly . He again felt the sweat trickling . " Yes , General . " " OK . Now , I do n't suppose there will be any way to get these men back to the units they were assigned to before they , ah , made the team . " " I doubt it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What we have to figure out , Mike , is how to get these men back into the mainstream of the Marine Corps without giving any suggestion that we 're punishing them . " " We could make them available as replacements to field units . " " Yes , some , maybe , but we do n't want them thinking they just got dumped . " The colonel thought for a moment , being careful not to drink his brandy too quickly . " If at least some of them could be induced to volunteer for small , elite units , " he let the thought hang between them . The general smoked and sipped . " Perhaps . Find out what 's out there , Mike . I just do n't want anyone to think these boys are being dumped because they played ball well enough to serve a somewhat unorthodox need of a commander . Sony , Mike , you never heard that implied criticism of my predecessor . " The commandant smiled . " One other thing . I want to talk to some of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Marine Corps . We really must try to handle this whole situation with great delicacy , Mike . " " Yes , sir , I completely agree . " Fuck this up , he thought , and a lieutenant general in the office of the commandant of the Marine Corps gets pissed , and General Dowd and I will be guarding the embassy in Lagos for the rest of our days . " Which ones would you like to see , General ? " " I 'll just take three or four at random , " said the commandant , pulling several tiles from the stack . " " These . " Emrite took the files from the general 's hand . The one on top belonged to Coles , Robert R. , Sergeant , USMC . Emrite thanked the general forp234the fine dinner and left , vowing to himself to do this thing as well as any man could , for his sake , for the men , and especially for the commandant , who probably stood to lose more than any of them if the thing went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immensely liked . Colonel Emrite finished explaining the nature of his dinner conversation with General Dowd to the topkick , Sergeant Major Jackson . Jackson looked puzzled , and took his time mulling over the revelations . " So you figure , Colonel , that all these boys goin ' to line units ? " " Looks that way , Sergeant Major , nothing for it . " Jackson shrugged . " You know , Colonel , I think some of ' em be glad . These men too proud , too good , to be house marines . " " The important thing , Sergeant Major , and I 'm echoing the general , is that none of them feel they 're being punished . Bad feeling could mean difficulty , for , ah , well , everyone . " Emrite smiled weakly . Jackson grinned . " I hear you , Colonel , sir . " He laughed without sound . " Yeah , well , Sergeant Major , I guess you been covering for officers for most of your life  --  " " Twenny-eight years , sir . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the thing is being done right , so he wants to speak to a sample of the men . The players . " " Who he got in mind , Colonel ? " " He picked four , at random . Take a look , " Emrite handed Jackson the four service records . Jackson opened each record slowly , and set each aside . Coles 's was the last record . " Seems all right , Colonel . But this last man , Coles , he 's a bit of a hard case . He was drafted to the NFL . " Emrite shifted uneasily , " Do you think he 'll act up , Sergeant Major ? " Jackson shrugged again . " Not if I talk to him . I think he feels badabout not goin ' up with the one-slash-twenny-six . Besides , he is a smartboy . " Emrite rose . " OK , Sergeant Major , talk to him . Talk to all of them , but do n't coach them . This general , General Dowd , when he looks into your eyes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jackson chuckled , " I hear you , sir . " General Dowd invited Sergeant Coles to be seated in his small office . Bobby sat at rigid attention while the general relit his pipe . Bobby triedp235to make himself as calm as possible , but he felt the stress in his body rising with the blue smoke from the general 's pipe . The top had warned him that the general was a cold piece  --  marine corps jargon for a man who could not be read and who could not be fooled . Bobby waited . The general put his matches aside and tamped down the burning tobacco with an empty rifle shell casing . " Sergeant Coles , I expect you know why you 're here . " Coles shifted slightly in the hard chair , trying to gain some space . " Sergeant Major Jackson said you wanted to talk to  --  some of the men on the team , General . About new assignments . " Leave it blank , thought Coles . The general blew a cloud of sweet-smelling smoke at the roof of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you men , Sergeant . I want you to understand that . " " Yes , sir . " " Well , then , Sergeant , what would you like to do ? " Coles was surprised . He had been expecting to be hustled off to some repple depple  --  replacement depot  --  in Vietnam , without further ceremony . " Are n't we to be shipped off to Nam , General ? Are n't we viewed , ah , beg the general 's pardon , sir  --  " " Speak frankly , Marine , " said the general , around the pipe . "  --  As a bunch of fuck-ups , ah , sir ? " The general seemed to breath more energy through his pipe , increasing the smog . " Any reason why you should , Sergeant ? " " No , sir ! Not to my mind , sir ! " Sit and wait , he thought . " Nor to my mind , either , Sergeant . Neither you , nor any of theother marines , " the general stretched the word , filled it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that team , have anything to explain . " OK , thought Bobby , warily . " So what should we do , General ? " " You tell me , Sergeant Coles . I have some flexibility in gettingyou orders . " Bobby relaxed his face into an even , noncommittal smile . " Any black outfits needing ready-mix sergeants , General ? " The general looked into Sergeant Coles 's eyes , and saw the edge of defiance and defiance 's sister , fear . " There have n't been any segregated outfits since War Two , Sergeant . " This is getting away from me , thought Coles . " I think Nam , General . I think some kind of special unit . " " Why a special unit . Sergeant ? "  |p236Bobby  flushed with anger , or fear , or something in between . " Because , General , I know now , like I did n't know before , that I 'm a marine , and I want to prove it , sir . " There , dammit , he made me say it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time the smoke was more noxious . " I believe I told you that you have nothing special to prove , Sergeant . " Bobby looked at his hands , clasped tightly against his belt buckle . I really do n't know what I want , he thought , but I do n't ever want to feel again that I ca n't be part of it . The war . He remembered vividly the day his battalion left for Nam , and how they looked and felt , and how apart he had felt . It does n't matter that no one , other than that asshole Sergeant Phillips , ever criticized my staying here . Marines are proud , he thought , his mind beginning to race . Yes , dammit , I know I 'm right . It is fucking crazy , but I 'm proud , too . Marine proud . " That 's what I would like , General . " Bobby listened to his own voice , heard it soft , and proud , and devoid of even the small measure of defiance he had brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead pipe down in a big glass ashtray . He looked at Bobby , and for the first time in the course of the interview , smiled in a friendly way . " Good , Sergeant , good . Give me a couple of days . I 'll get you into a good outfit . With  --  " the general paused , and reached slowly across his desk with his hand extended , " my strongest recommendation . " Bobby shook the hand , and jumped up to attention , grinning . " Thank you , sir ! " " Thank you , Sergeant Coles . Good men like you make my job a pleasure . "  |p237Sergeant  Billy Hunter took his tepid jungle shower slowly , shivering slightly despite the heat of early afternoon . He suspected the malaria was gaining a bit ; it did that , waxed and waned , always there , yet never dominant , at least not yet . Clever parasite , he thought . The 1st of the 26th Marines was mostly in its " safe " bivouac , called Camp Seven , fifteen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of I Corps . Hunter was leading the pathfinder squad since Sergeant Nigroni had gotten himself killed two weeks previously by tripping a wire . The antivehicle mine Nigroni had tripped had blown away Hammond , the M-60 machine gunner , and the new second lieutenant , Rains , in addition to the sergeant himself . Hunter felt sad about that , to the extent that he could feel anything about anything or anyone , after six weeks of nonstop , long-range recon patrols . The mission of Hunter 's battalion and two others was to work short distances westward along Highway 9 , leading from Dong Ha to Khe Sanh in the west and across the border into Laos . The operations were meant to interdict the southward movement of supplies from North Vietnamto the Viet Cong forces who infested the otherwise nearly depopulated jungle . The marines held the coast against considerable opposition , and they held Khe Sanh , and had held it against attacks that had been occurring for six months . Marine casualties had been steady , and at times heavy.  |p238The  men speculated that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as well as the men and materiel required , to force a passage all the way up Highway 9 , and then to hold the road . But for now , there were barely enough resources to cling to the ends of the highway , and to try to cut off the supplies that flowed across the DMZ each night . While most of the marines operated noisily and in daylight around Quang Tri and the outposts of the Leatherneck Square  --  the largest of which were Con Thien , Gio Linh , Dong Ha , and Cam Lo  --  Hunter 's long-range recon patrols , or LRRPs , and those of two other units were mostly employed in quiet night operations . The men worked in the inky darkness of the tropical nights , watching road crossings or mining them , seeking out enemy troop concentrations , and more recently , penetrating enemy perimeters all the way to the Ben Hai River , which marked the middle of the DMZ and border between North and South Vietnam . Hunter had heard that the LRRPs might soon be extended beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men and materiel . Hunter welcomed the week of respite his unit had been promised by the captain , but he felt as well the draw of the jungle , and of the nighttime battle for the darkness . He stepped from the shower and rubbed himself vigorously with his stowaway dry towel . The shivering stayed with him , but lighter , the fever soft , like the buzz of two strong drinks too quickly taken . Hunter dressed in clean marine greens , transferring only his cigarettes and his sergeant 's chevrons from the old and dirty uniform . The brightly polished brass chevrons were pinned on the inside of the breast pocket , and the flap buttoned down over them . Brass chevrons had drawn many a bullet . Hunter stepped out of the latrine and encountered Trace , his leading noncom and machine-gunner . Corporal Trace was a quiet black man , tall and strong , from Nashville , Tennessee . He was a little older than Hunter , and had been in the Marine Corps for two years . Hunter valued the corporal 's experience in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learn the ropes of the night war . " Let 's take a walk , Sergeant , ease down . " Hunter smiled , " Ease down is good , Trace . Where to ? " " The ville , just outside the wire . Relaxing place , secure . " " OK . I might could use some relax . " Trace led Hunter down a steep slope to a collection of three small huts , apparently built on a marine rubbish dump . The huts were constructedof traditional bamboo frames walled with woven elephant grass ,  |p239armored  with tin cans beaten flat . The roofs were of pilfered corrugated galvanized steel , and the foundations were crudely sandbagged . Stretched from roof poles and poles jutting from the dirt around the hootches were lengths of stolen marine corps wire , from which hung drying marine corps laundry . Scrawny chickens pecked at imaginary food around the hootches . Hunter felt uneasy , and thumbed the selector of his M-14 from safe to fire . " Why are we here , Trace ? " " Relaxation , Sarge . Be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had his own weapon slung over his shoulder , muzzle downward . " Ah Loan ! " he called into the silent encampment . Hunter marveled at the lack of voice in Vietnamese farm animals ; the whole country hid from the terror of days and especially nights . Hunter looked right and left , and stooped to look under the hootches . " Ah Loan ! " called Trace a second time . Hunter caught movement in the corner of his left eye and trained the rifle rapidly . He carefully released the thumb pressure on the safety as he saw that his target was a young Vietnamese woman , a girl , really , standing in the dark doorway of the largest of the three hootches . Ignoring the rifle leveled at her heart , she beckoned , wordlessly , for the two marines to enter . She disappeared inside the hootch . Trace followed her in , and , after a moment 's hesitation , so did Hunter . The interior of the hootch was dark , and fragrant with incense . Trace was well-known to the occupants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Hunter made out an old man , an old woman , and the woman child . Trace engaged them in urgent , low-toned conversation . The old man cackled and nodded , and held out his hand . Trace placed a wad of bills in the hand , which closed like a trap and disappeared inside the old man 's dirty black T-shirt . " Sit here , Sergeant , " said Trace , motioning to a dilapidated mattress , covered in cheap yellow synthetic fabric . Trace sat on a mattress opposite , pulling his legs into the lotus position under him . The girl served the two marines tea as the older people departed through a curtain wall into the adjoining hootch . The girl then opened a wooden box inlaid with what appeared to be mother of pearl , and extracted two long , thin , and expertly rolled joints . She handed one to Hunter and the other to Trace , and bowed and left the hootch . Hunter held the unlit joint in his hand , and then sniffed it . It was faintly perfumed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't do drugs . I mean , never . " He continued to hold the joint , and to stare at it.  | " It 's harmless , man , " answered Trace . " We 're stood down , and you 're so tight you do n't even sleep . Believe me , I 'm your friend . " The girl returned with a coal from the family 's cooking fire held between two bamboo tongs . She took the joint from Trace and lit it carefully , inhaling just enough to get it going properly . She then took Hunter 's , and lit it . It seemed that her eyes held his as she puffed the flame alive , then gently , wordlessly , placed the stick between his lips . Hunter could not refuse the gift , carried to him as it was in those dark and caressing eyes . He took a soft drag , then a bit more . The smoke was hot in his throat , and dry . He drank some tea , and watched Trace , who surged the smoke deep into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holding the smoke in , then slowly letting it escape through the corners of his mouth . The girl said something to Trace , and he nodded , still letting the smoke slide in thin spirals from the edges of his smile . Once again , the girl disappeared . Hunter took another drag , and held it in a bit longer . He still felt nothing , but he noticed the incense scent was stronger , and that the details of the furniture in the room were clearer , and seemed to be more in harmony than he first had realized . " Trace , hey , Trace ? " Trace cracked an eye open . It seemed the maximum effort of which he was capable . " Relax , Billy , relax , relax . " Hunter was relaxed , far more so than at any time since he had stepped off the landing craft near Dong Ha , however long ago that was . He took another little smoke . " Trace , whad-whad is ' is shit ? " Trace smiled . " You floatin ' yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trace laughed , very slowly . The laugh rolled and echoed in the hootch . The sound of the laugh had the richness of a bass fiddle . " It 's called five-sixths , Bro . Laotian grass , pinch of shaved opium . Harmless , harmless . " Opium , thought Hunter , man , that is serious . Grass is bad enough , but opium ! The joint had burned down to his fingers , and without thinking , he took another long drag before dropping the smoldering end in a cracked plate the girl had left in front of him . He could picture the girl very clearly in his mind , and he wished she would return . The girl pushed through the curtain holding a teapot and a tray with three tiny china cups , and a fat candle in a holder made from a C-ration can . She placed the tray on the floor , and set the candle midway between Trace and Hunter . Her movements were curiously slow andp241exact . The skirts of her deep blue ao dai swung out like shimmering wings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ served Trace , then Hunter , from the teapot , passing each his cup with both hands , head bowed low . Hunter took the cup , watching her crown of shiny black hair as he did so . He could see each individual , brilliantly shining lock of her hair . How remarkable , he thought . The drink was hot rice wine , very sweet and viscous . It soothed Hunter 's throat from the harshness of the smoke . Once again the girl left the room . " Hey , Trace , man . " " Hey , Trace , man . " Did n't I just say that ? thought Hunter . Did I ever say it ? Trace was unmoving , across the small room , save for a slight swaying in his lotus position . Was he really swaying ? Hunter was confused , yet he felt warm and safe , safe . The girl entered the room , this time carrying two bamboo tubes and two silver knitting needles , and a small rice bowl containing what looked to be black tar . Hunter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bowl on one needle , and held it above the flame of the candle in front of him . Using the other needle to shape it , she slowly , incredibly slowly , wound the tar into a ball , and added to it from the bowl , making the ball larger until it was a half inch in diameter . She then set aside the first needle , leaning it against the cracked plate to cool . She started another ball on the second needle , shaping it with her moistened finger and grimacing when the black paste stuck to her finger and burned . Hunter felt pain with her , and raised his hand to help her , but she did n't see him . Finally , she set the second needle , with its black glob of tar on the end , next to the first against the rim of the plate . The girl floated over to Trace , handed him his wine cup , and waited while he drained it . She then took up one of the knitting needles and squeezed the ball of paste @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attached to the side of one of the bamboo tubes . She tilted the cup next to the candle flame and sucked on the top of the bamboo tube . Hunter watched as the ball in the cup became cherry red , and smelled the sweet gray smoke that swirled in the silent room . The girl choked at the smoke in her throat and grimaced again . She handed the bamboo pipe to Trace , who put it to his lips and inhaled , slowly . The pill in the pipe 's cup glowed . The girl floated hack to Hunter 's side of the hootch , bowed , and offered him wine . Ile reached out and touched her hair , and she drewp242away . He wanted to apologize , but he could n't , because she was holding the cup of wine to his lips . Sweet , sorrow , safe . She lit the second pipe and gave it to him . Watching Trace in the distance , he took a long , slow toke . Sweet smoke , very hot , burned in his throat and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes against the tears , and floated free , up and out of the hootch . The girl watched him , her face upturned , her eyes wide . Hunter held out his hand to her , but she shook her head . He floated high above the jungle , seeing the trails he had patrolled . He floated over the fat , muddy Ben Hai River , and realized he was over North Vietnam . He tried to twist his body and turn back south , but he could not control his movement . Below him , he could see columns of men in black and blue uniforms sneaking down trails toward the south . They could easily have shot him , but they never looked up . Hunter floated out over the sea . Billy felt he must have slept , for he now floated on in the night . Below him in the gray of false dawn were silent fields , and barns and houses , and Billy knew that he was home . He could see the old creek , and his two little brothers at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Billy shouted , but the two little children were watching the creek , and they did not look up . Billy struggled to break free of whatever was keeping him up , keeping him moving , but he could not . The scene from his boyhood drifted away behind him . The pace of his movement quickened , and he could no longer see clearly what was below him . He was racing along , rocking from side to side . Ahead he could see a pinpoint of yellow light , which grew rapidly larger as he hurtled toward it . He recognized the light as the flames of the end of time . He felt the searing heat on his face and then he burst through into nothingness . Hunter woke up in his own bed . His eyes were grainy and his mouth was sour . There was no one else in the hootch . He looked at his watch , six-thirty . Breakfast , he thought abstractly . He raised himself carefully from the cot , feeling nauseated . I wonder how I got back here , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might have done anything . I 've lost most of an afternoon and all of a night . I might have been caught , I do n't even know . Hunter picked up his douche kit and went to the head . There were a few marines still shaving and washing up , but most had gone on to chow . The men he knew said hello to him ; nothing seemed out of place.  |p243He  put his kit on the shelf and stuck his head under the cold water tap to get the cobwebs out . There was a searing pain on his cheek , and he pulled his head back quickly from the water stream . He looked at the cracked strip of mirror , and reached up and touched a red , blistered spot on his face . " Nasty burn , " said Trace , beside him . In a whisper , Trace added , " Let 's go to chow , Sergeant . We got to talk a bit . " " Damn straight , Trace . What the hell did you get me into ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Let 's get over to the mess tent before all the bacon is gone . " Hunter brushed his teeth and shaved quickly . Fortunately the mysteriousburn was above his beard , but the pressure of the razor on his cheek made him weep with pain . " I better get a dressing for this burn . " " Got it right here , Babe . All ready to go , burn ointment and all . Just pat it dry ; the blister has burst . " Hunter patted his face with the cleanest corner of his towel and Trace expertly taped the gauze pad in place . " Now let 's go find us a quiet corner and get some eats . You must be hungry , after all that sleep . " Hunter followed Trace across the dusty grinder to the mess tent . He was aching to question Trace , but he understood the wisdom of waiting until they could get into a reasonably private spot . Trace 's apparent lack of concern was by itself reassuring . Billy 's stomach was still churning , but when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and bacon , he found he was indeed hungry , and he took a generous portion . He followed Trace to a table at the far end that was just being vacated by a group of marines from Headquarters Company . Hunter and Trace exchanged greetings with the departing group and then had the table to themselves . Trace took a swallow of coffee and said softly , " You gave me a bit of a scare last night , Sergeant Billy . " " I do n't remember a thing . What the fuck happened ? " Billy started eating . His appetite was enormous . Trace touched a finger to his own cheek quickly . " Among other things , you keeled over into the candle . Little Nga had to pull you out . " " Jesus , " said Billy , eating . " And you were raving something about the flames of the end of time . " Hunter drank some coffee . His senses seemed especially keen . Hep244wondered if the drug had completely worn off . " How did I get back to camp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side . " " Jesus ! Do you think anybody saw us ? " " Lots of people saw us . It was eight o'clock at night . We did n't run around naked , or bay at the moon ; we just walked in . You were very quiet , and a little scared , I think . You kept asking me to hold you down if you started to float away . " " Christ , I do n't remember any of this . " " You must have taken too much , too fast . And I shoulda warned you , ' cause I know you ai n't been sleeping . " " How did it affect you ? " Trace shrugged . " Just very mellow , very relaxed , man . I had another pipe while you slept ; then we walked back , took a shower , and I put you to bed . I dumped your uniform , by the way , because it reeked of smoke . " " Jesus , well , thanks for taking care of me , but we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caught and spent the rest of our natural lives in some brig . " Trace looked at Billy hard , the corners of his mouth pinching with anger . " Now , look , asshole , I was right there , I took care of you . You needed to relax , and if nothing else , you got around ten hours of sleep . You are my friend and my squad leader , and you need to relax . " Hunter looked at Trace . " I guess you 're right , I have been awfully tight since the sergeant and that lieutenant got blown away . But I 'm not sure I could handle another experience quite like that . " " Next time you will know to go slow . " Not for me , thought Billy . " That little girl sure was pretty . " Trace grinned . " She says she 's seventeen . She liked you too ; shecried when you burned your face . I promised to bring you back . " I will go back , then , but not for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see Nga . Pretty name , I wonder what it means ? " It means moon , " said Trace , grinning . " What ? " asked Billy . " Nga means moon , Sergeant . Now , Sergeant , we have a war to run . " Trace got up and took his empty tray in one hand and Hunter 's in the other . Billy swallowed the last of his coffee , and followed.  |p245Billy  leaned back and closed his eyes , feeling the laced-up joint of five-sixths take effect , turning his mind loose to follow trails that passed from I Corps to anywhere . Nga lay with her head in his lap , warm and half asleep . Trace had gone off with one of the older girls , after giving the grinning Ah Loan more money . At first , Billy had wanted to sleep with Nga , but after Ah Loan had told him she was a virgin and therefore worth five hundred American dollars , he had decided he liked the idea of her virginity . Ah Loan continued to leer and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just smiled . Fuck Ah Loan , he thought , drifting through the jungle night . Since his first frightening experience , Billy had stayed well away from the pure opium . One , or at the most two of the tight , thin joints of five-sixths gave him all the space and relaxation he needed , and he felt he could almost direct his fantasy flights . He also thought he could come back down quickly if need be , though he did n't risk smoking unless he was sure his patrol squad was stood down for at least the next day . His refusal of the opium pipe irritated Ah Loan , who complained that the price of two joints hardly paid for his hospitality , and certainly not for the attendance of his prettiest " daughter . " Fuck Ah Loan . Billy stroked Nga 's lightly perfumed hair . The problem is that the old bastard knows I really come here for the girl , and not for the dope , thought Billy , and sooner or later he is going to put the squeeze on me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him lightly , her lips closed , a child 's kiss . " Mo ' wine , Bilee ? " she whispered , hugging him around his neck . " No , my love , just stay with me . " " Yes , Bi-lee . " She settled down again , her cheek against his groin . He felt himself stirring as Nga innocently , perhaps unknowingly , placed her tiny hand on his penis , which uncurled itself painfully inside his trousers . He dared not reach down to free it lest he break the spell . He forced his mind away from his body , and the painful fullness subsided . He drifted , the image of the innocent lady moon in his lap alternating with that of the leering , yellow-eyed , gap-toothed Ah Loan . Billy wished he could get the girl away from the old panderer before he did manage to get his filthy five hundred American dollars from some corrupt Vietnamesegeneral . He knew no marine would come up with it ; marines did n't care about virginity , unless , like Billy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything imaginable for five American dollars , boom/boom . Billy was getting decidedly unrelaxed , and was considering having the second joint , when the sound of hands clapping sharply , once , twice , intruded on the perfect silence of the little room . Nga got up quickly and darted through the dirty beaded curtain that separated the room from the main house . Damn Ah Loan , thought Billy , reaching inside his trousers to straighten out his semihard penis . Billy heard the sounds of argument from beyond the curtain  --  Ah Loan 's gruff singsong and Nga 's softer replies . What does the old dickhead want now , thought Billy , fully awake and pissed off . Nga came back into the room , her head bowed , and knelt beside Billy . He could see she was crying . " What is it , my lady moon ? " " Ah Loan say time up , you must go , Bi-lee . " " Why ? What 's the hurry , Nga ? " " Ah Loan say , you no smoke , you no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ muchee monee , Bi-lee . " She put her arms around his neck and gave him one of her dry kisses . He brushed her tears away gently with his calloused fingers . Here comes the squeeze , thought Billy . " Tell Ah Loan I want to speak with him , Nga . " " He angry , Bi-lee . " " Tell him to come in , please , Nga . " " Yes , Bi-lee . Bi-lee , you not leave Nga , please ? " Billy 's heart rolled over . I ca n't possibly be in love with this Asian child , but I am . " No , Nga , I wo n't leave you . " She was crying again . " I will speak with Ah Loan . " Nga got up and left the room . There was another noisy conversation , and Ah Loan entered the small room , his face set in theatrical anger . Billy decided to wait until the other man spoke . Ah Loan seemed to have the same expectation , so for a moment the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the mattress across the room . Billy decided it would be polite to begin . " Your daughter says I have offended your house , Thich Loan . " Ah Loan 's set visage softened slightly at Billy 's use of the wholly inappropriate honorific , which meant " venerable . " " Sergeant ! You spend all time with youngest daughta , not take pipe , not take muchee drink , no make boom-boom otha daughta ! Ah Loan you friend , all time , but must have business ! " Once again he twisted his face into an exaggerated scowl.  |p247Hunter  said , " Why do n't you charge me a fee for the time I spend here ? " He had suggested this before . " No good ! Otha marine , they no come , they know all time youngest daughta with Sergeant Hunta . No come , no spend money ! Old Loan , old wife , all daughta all starve . " Ah Loan leaned forward , with a big , sad frown , and spread his hands like a supplicant . The greedy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do n't want me to come any more . " " Not if no can spend money , enjoy all hospitality of Ah Loan . " " I could n't spend so much money every time I come . A sergeant does n't get much . " I 'll bet he knows to the penny what my pay comes to , thought Hunter . " Maybe sergeant can get mo ' money . " Once again Ah Loan leaned forward , but this time his expression was pure greed . " Maybe Ah Loan can help . " I should n't even listen to this , thought Billy . There has to be a way I can keep seeing Nga , but I ca n't have anything to do with this old thief . " How might that be , Ah Loan ? " Ah Loan grinned , revealing his prized gold teeth . " Ah Loan thinking , Sergeant , this place of Ah Loan special . Only fliends of Ah Loan can come , people dusted , no bad double from camp . But Ah Loan know many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Billy knew that was true . The stuff was everywhere , and as long as nobody used too much , or used it on duty or in the field , nobody said anything . " Maybe Ah Loan get mo ' glass , not so good as Ah Loan have here , this place . Maybe sergeant can sell to marines . " " I could n't do that , Ah Loan . " I wonder if I could , thought Hunter . " Make muchee money , come all time see youngest daughta . " They get it somewhere , thought Hunter , so where 's the harm ? Still , I do n't want to be a pusher for this old crook . " How much would I have to sell ? " Ah Loan shrugged , " Start slow , careful . No muchee . " No muchee , thought Billy . That 's where it starts . There has to be another way . He stood up , and put on his shapeless jungle hat . " Maybe I 'll think about it . " " Maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll think about it , Ah Loan . " I am in a box , thought Hunter . Ah Loan rose , rubbed stiffness from his legs . " Take time , think here , have one mo ' smoke , guest of Ah Loan . Sit , fliend Sergeant Ilunta ,  |p248I  send youngest daughta . " Before Billy could answer , Ah Loan slipped through the curtain . Billy sat . Nga reappeared with the joint and a teakettle full of hot rice wine . She looked radiantly happy . She chattered and rubbed the tense muscles of Billy 's neck while he smoked . Billy relaxed . How bad could it be , he thought . If I do it carefully , nobody gets hurt , and I can be with Nga . If Ah Loan ups the ante , I can get out . I 'd lose Nga , but I lose her anyway if I do n't go along . But it is dealing . Nga took the roach from his fingers before it could burn him , then pushed him onto his back . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lips , a slightly more adult kiss , her mouth partly open . Billy touched her lips with his tongue . She moaned a little , and shifted her body on top of his , and gently nibbled his tongue with her lips . Billy 's penis straightened out and swelled , pushing against Nga 's thigh . When her hand found his engorged member through his trousers , Billy knew it was no accident . Her mouth opened and engulfed his tongue . Billy found himself fighting against the effects of the joint . Part of him wanted to make love to Nga ; part of him wanted to preserve her chastity . He felt too weak to do either . Nga took her sweet lips from his . He realized she was unbuttoning his trousers . A protest arose in his mind and died in his throat . Slowly , awkwardly , Nga unbuttoned his fly and jerked his penis free . If he had been wearing underwear , she never would have managed it . Billy lay back , and covered his eyes with his left arm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jerk him off , not the way he would have done it himself , holding his dick in a fist , but with her hand on top of it , fingers downward , like a spider caressing the very tip of it . Billy squirmed with pleasure and pain . Her other hand grasped his shaft around its base while the fingers floated and danced at the tip , teasing , caressing . She leaned across his chest and kissed his neck . " Bi-lee . " " Yes , my lady moon , " rasped Hunter . " Bi-lee , I love you . I want to give you my virginity . " Hunter came , explosively . The juice sprayed everywhere , on hisface , and hers . Gently , she let his penis fall from her hands , leaving itwilting on his stomach . She took the towel from the tray , and gentlydabbed at his face , then hers , then at his uniform . " Bi-lee , I love you . " Billy 's head was clearing rapidly . He put his arm around Nga'sp249neck and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the lips , and once again , he explored her soft mouth with his tongue . " Nga , I love you too . " He held her in his arms until the dope and the spell receded , and then he dressed , went through the curtain , and told Ah Loan that he would deal marijuana.  |p250Sergeant  Hunter led his patrol squad out of the camp in the early afternoon . They still had n't replaced Rains , the second lieutenant who had gotten killed . Hunter could hardly remember what he looked like . Replacements had come in for the two riflemen killed in the same action , but Sergeant Nigroni 's billet was still empty , so they were only nine leaving camp , heading for the foggy hills and jungle-choked creek beds of the dead marine zone . The men of the LRRPs considered themselves special , different from the troops who moved in the light . Hunter watched as the men took up single-file patrol alignment , without any spoken commands . Trace took the point , with the M-60 machine gun . Once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front of him for trip wires and other booby traps . The second man , Capiello , looked up , for wires in the trees . The third man , Phillips , one of the cherries , looked right , and Stevens , behind him , looked left . Hunter walked fifth , with Jonas , the other replacement , behind him , humping the radio . Seventh , Stinson , looked right , and eighth , Da Silva , looked left . Smith , the drag man , the marine with the most experience in the LRRPs after Trace , walked backward much of the time , watching their rear . Each man except Trace carried the clumsy fourteen-pound M-14 rifle and two bandoliers of ammunitionp251magazines . The Army had the new , lighter M-16 , but the marines still humped the fourteen . More accurate , the old-timers said . Still , Hunter would have liked the extra firepower of the newer weapon , with its lighter ammo and higher rate of fire . Each man carried a light battle pack , which weighed about half the standard infantry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water . Jonas was additionally burdened with the bulky PRC-10 radio , but the other guys divided up most of his extra ammo , and Stinson carried the radio 's extra battery . Each man other than Jonas carried a Claymore mine and either a machete or an entrenching tool , a small spade that could be set at an angle to its shaft and used like a pick . Phillips carried detonators , both screw-type and claquers . Da Silva carried the hundredfifty-footroll of detonation cord , a kind of linear plastic explosive , and a roll of insulated wire nearly half a mile long , which could be used to make both trip wires and detonation connectors . The top of Stevens 's pack held eight wrapped one-pound bricks of C-4 plastic explosive . Fragmentation and smoke grenades rounded out the outfit . Hunter found it ironic that his nightcrawlers carried less gear than the marines who moved by day , and who could expect to be resupplied in the field by helicopter , usually no less often than every other day . The main force marines would carry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't trust the water in the streams . The LRRPs did n't trust the water either , but since they could n't possibly carry enough to last an entire mission , they drank stream water heavily salted with water-purification pills , and resigned themselves to having the shits . Similarly , the nightcrawlers preferred dried rations , most of which had to be cooked , to the heavier , bulkier canned C-rations the others carried . The LRRPs looked like normal marines , except for two small differences . The LRRPs had been issued the new canvas-sided jungle boots , while the rest of the battalion still wore leather , which turned sodden and rotted in the jungle . In addition , the nightcrawlers wore shapeless hats of green camouflage cloth , eschewing the protection of the steel helmet because it was thought the harsh outline was too easy to see in the jungle , even with leaves stuck in the fabric helmet cover . Before going out , Trace checked every man 's gear , even Hunter 's , for anything that could rattle or clank as the men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The officer should be there , next to the radio , and the V ( ' knew it , so the radio antenna made ap252popular aiming point during an ambush . By rights , Hunter should have been back with the drag man . Hunter did n't like talking on the radio . Hunter did n't like having the responsibility of command . The men walked in silence . As soon as they passed out of the cleared zone outside the camp 's barbed wire perimeter , they were in territory claimed by the enemy and , at least at night , patrolled by him . Hunter thought about the mission . The first night they were to set up an ambush at the intersection of two trails the intelligence types said had been getting a lot of traffic . Both trails led south from North Vietnam , and were used by the 219th NVA Division to support and resupply the Viet Cong units that operated in the area near the strong points of the Leatherneck Square . The nightcrawlers would mine the crossing with Claymores , and observe as best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lightly armed to get into a firefight even with a supply column . The second part of the mission was more tricky . If activity was detected on the first night , the patrol was to follow the most promising of the two trails , to determine where it crossed the river and how . Hunter had been told that the NVA built packed gravel roads on the bottom of the shallow , slow-moving Ben Hai , but he had never seen one . Rumor control even alleged that the NVA had tanks that could cross over these bridges to attack the marines in their camps . Hunter ; who had crossed the area many times , scoffed at this ; the jungle trails were passable at best for a bicycle . Moss , the grizzled lifer topkick up at Headquarters Company , said that the RAMF experts had made the same judgement about the Ardennes Forest at the beginning of War Two . If the patrol located a significant crossing , they were to conceal special devices at either end . The briefing officer had told Hunter that the devices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from an air force B-52 , after which they would signal the precise location of the bridge , which was otherwise invisible from above . The need to mark both ends meant that the unit , or at least part of it , would have to cross the river into North Vietnam . Hunter hoped they would n't find any bridges . The men walked deeper into the damp jungle in silence , spacing themselves two meters apart , watching where they stepped . There was plenty of time ; their first objective was only five kilometers from the camp , and most of the walking was downhill . They reached the first of the trails at 1545 , and followed it north to an intersection with whatp253looked to be a much larger trail . They had followed the smaller trail south on previous patrols , but they had never been this far north , and they had n't seen the larger trail before . The men dropped their packs by the side of the road , and fanned out cautiously . The larger trail was about ten feet wide and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if not a tank , thought Hunter . There were marks of recent clearing on the trees and creepers . Looking up , Hunter could see that in some places branches from trees on opposite sides of the trail had been pulled together and tied , adding to the difficulty of spotting the trail from the air . Hunter heard a low whistle , and turned to find Phillips pointing at something beside the road with his rifle . Hunter squatted and looked , pleased that even the cherry knew not to touch anything found in the bush . The object was a rubber sandal , the kind worn by VC and peasants alike , but there was no reason for a peasant to be anywhere near this place . " Trace , " whispered Hunter . The machine-gunner joined him . " VC shoe , " said Trace . " They do n't leave them around . " Trace circled the rubber sandal with his machete . " No wire that I can find . " " No ? What do you think ? " Trace looked at Hunter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still early afternoon , yet the light level was dropping . " Trap . They left this for us to find . " " Do you think the VC know we 're here , Trace ? " asked Phillips , his face taut . " Sure they do . We know they 're here , they got ta know we 're around . Whaddya think , Sergeant ? " Hunter drew in a breath , then let it out slowly . He was n't afraid of command ; he just felt he had never been prepared for it . " I say we change the plan . For some reason , the VC have left us a sign that they 've been here . They never do that , except to set a trap . " " So what do we do ? " asked Phillips . Hunter fought back a mild anger . In time , the cherry would learn not to ask . " We move the ambush . " He looked at his watch . " We have at least two and a half hours of daylight . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better place . " " We gon na stay on the road ? " asked Trace . " No , we 'll slide through the hush , and follow the ridge line and the stream that shapes this track . What we do best , nightcrawlers. "  |p254Trace  grinned , " Aye , aye , Sergeant ! " Trace hated roads . Hunter smiled . Trace always guided him , but never obviously . How I wish for some nice young officer for me to guide , then leave to him the awful decisions . " Move out , quietly , men . Let 's get up near that ridge line , without showing ourselves . " The unit moved off with silence restored , Da Silva now at point . Trace had moved back to fourth , in front of Hunter . Hunter spoke in a whisper that would n't carry . " Trace , we need a straight stretch , with a turn , so we can observe . This is a heavy-duty trail . " " Yeah . Basic chicken-leg ambush . What do you think we might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about old Moss . Vehicles , at least light ones , could move down this trail . " " Maybe we should just mark that crossing with those air force doodads , and di-di-mau back to camp . " Hunter thought about it for only a moment . " No . We 're good , Trace . We can set up a mechanical ambush , and watch what goes through . If need be , we can slip out . " Trace looked proud and skeptical at the same time . " We can , Trace . " The patrol slipped slowly through the thickening jungle . Only by moving slowly could the men move in silence . They stayed well below the crest of the ridge . They were able to see the road through the jungle only occasionally , but they could see enough to follow it . It was important not to leave any sign of their presence on the road itself to alert the enemy . After nearly an hour of snail-like progress , they reached a sharp bend in the trail , dictated by a rocky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's flow toward the Ben Hai . The patrol carefully glided from the jungle back to the edge of the road . " Almost perfect , " said Trace . " Yeah . We can set it up a hundred meters away , on the bend , and watch it from the straight , " counseled Smith . " Trace , take two men , and chart our routes of escape , if we have to pull back into the jungle , " whispered Hunter . " Smith , scout the ambush site , and if it looks OK , rig it . " Trace pointed at Phillips and Capiello , and disappeared noiselessly into the damp jungle . Smith took the rest of the patrol save Jonas and Da Silva , and headed for the ambush site one hundred meters away.  |p255His  detachment kept well away from the trail itself . Hunter , Da Silva , and Jonas waited fully ten minutes before they could see Smith cross the road with a Claymore in his hand , trailing , then burying , wire . Stevens crossed quickly , carrying the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the packed earth surface of the road , and buried a second wire . Hunter watched through his night binoculars , admiring the way the ambush was planned , even though he could not see everything that Smith was doing . Smith had chosen a place on the trail where it bent as the stream bent . Above the curving streambed and next to the trail was a large tree , which had prominent roots standing out from its base . Smith wedged a Claymore in the cleft between two roots , about knee-high , where it would n't be seen by anyone coming down the trail until he was directly in front of the mine . Without seeing it done , Hunter knew that the other four Claymores Smith had collected would be arranged on the opposite side of the trail , around the outside of the same curve , and would be on a separate detonator circuit . The det cord , on a third circuit , would be laid in the streambed behind the big tree . Hunter watched through the binoculars as Smith and the others completed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ activity with branches they had cut from trees growing well away from the trail . Trace returned to Hunter 's side . " We can get up and out of here due west , Billy , " he whispered . " There 's a shallow cave just up the back , here . We can see the road and shoot it , if we want . " " Show me , " said Hunter . Trace picked up the M-60 and turned back into the jungle , with Hunter following . Soon they reached the cave , some ten meters back and three meters above the road . The path could be easily seen , and commanded from the cave , while the vegetation would partially mask much of the patrol 's muzzle flashes , even at night . " Pretty nice , hey , Sarge ? " Hunter liked it . The jungle behind the cave was thick ; they could lose themselves quickly if pursued , and the machine gun could drive anyone off the trail . The dinks could n't really have tanks , he thought . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trace smiled . " Aye , Billy . " Trace , Phillips , and ( ' apiello , with some help from Da Silva , set about making up the night defensive position , or NDP . They broke outp256entrenching tools and dug a shallow pit at the entrance to the cave , to hide their gear . Nightcrawlers stood their night watches light and ready to move . They built earth barriers to hide and protect the machine gun , and they filled canteens from the green , decay-smelling stream . Jonas answered a call from the company headquarters for a position report with a single press click on the microphone switch , which meant the patrol was on its night position . Which is n't entirely true , thought Hunter . Smith , whistling softly to announce his approach , entered the NDP . " Ambush is all laid out , Sergeant , good and proper , as the Aussies say . " " You walk it around , Smith ? " " Yeah , Sarge , me an ' the kids walked the whole perimeter ; no less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ambush , and this position . Reckon we ought a put out our remaining Claymores in front of the NDP , pointed toward the road ? " " Done , " murmured Trace from the lowest point in the dug-in position , where supper was being organized . Smith grinned , and deferred to Trace , " Sorry , pardner , did n't mean to step in . " " The sergeant is drivin ' , Smith . " Trace and Smith exchanged a glance . The two men had different feelings about cherry sergeants . Billy spoke . " Let 's get supper on . Nearly fully dark . Trace , set a perimeter watch . " " Aye , Sergeant . " Trace motioned to Da Silva and Jonas . Jonas unloaded the heavy radio gratefully , picked up his M-14 , and followed Da Silva to the mouth of the cave , the edge of the falling darkness . Capiello had become , by consensus , the cook for the team . From all the men 's packs he assembled the basics for a meal dry spaghetti , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He boiled water from a canteen in the patrol 's one cooking pot . The men would drink the fetid jungle water , but they would n't eat food prepared in it . The fire was made of shavings carefully carved from a block of C-4 explosive ; it burned quickly but very hot , with an acrid chemical smell that dissipated rapidly but with no smoke . In five minutes Capiello had the spaghetti cooking in rapidly boiling water , with the cans of tomato paste resting in the water above the softening spaghetti . At the right moment , he tossed the dried peas into the water with the spaghetti , and shortly after , added the cheese to the bubbling tomato paste . " Um , urn , " said Capiello , tasting , " that 's Italian . " The meal was doled out reverently into the men 's mess kits , and consumed in silence.  | " Damn good , Cap , " said Hunter . The others murmured praise . The men finished quickly , and washed their utensils and the cooking pot in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watches were set as darkness closed on the jungle like a shroud . Trace awakened Hunter from a doze . " Sergeant , Smith thinks he sees some activity near the ambush . " Hunter was instantly alert . " Coming down from the north ? " " He says they came from the south . Says they 're just sitting there , under our tree . " Hunter stood up quietly , and picked up his night binoculars and his M-14 . " Let 's go have a look . " Trace and Hunter joined Smith at the machine gun . The rest of the men in camp awakened and silently checked their equipment . Hunter steadied his night glasses on the earthwork next to the machine gun , and trained the glasses slowly back and forth across the road . The darkness was inky , and at first he could see nothing . Then he saw a flicker of movement , slightly grayish , and as his eyes completed their adjustment to the darkness , he could see a group of men squatting just off the trail . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Claymore . " " Yeah , " said Smith . " A trained man might find it , if he was lookin ' , but it 's pretty well hidden by the cleft between the roots , and we dumped a lotta leaves and shit all over it . " Smith moved closer to Hunter as Trace took over the M-60 . " Do we blow it , Sarge ? " Hunter continued to peer through the big eyes . " You say these gooks came from the south ? " Smith whispered , " They could n't have come from the north , Sarge , they would have had to pass right in front of me . Really , it seemed to me that they just appeared there . " " Coolies ? " offered Trace . " Probably , " said Hunter . " Waiting for a load of something to come down from the north . " He put the binoculars aside . " Smith , take me through the ambush plan once more . " Smith slid over to the right of the machine gun where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ OK , Sarge . Me , I always do them right to left . The first one blows the Claymore at the base of the tree . The second blows four Claymores laid out on the other side of the road at about seven-meter intervals , except there 's a gap about twice that wide across the field of the first Claymore . " " Good , " said Hunter , " pick up a whole section with that , if theyp258bunch . " Which they wo n't , he continued the thought . Still , if all five mines fired when pulled , the whole road would become a killing zone for a distance of thirty to forty meters on either side of the tree . " Yeah , thanks , Sarge . I figure we should be ready for a big force . We get a coupla guys only , we just blow the first Clay , an ' we can dig up the rest in the morning . " " Yeah , maybe . Let 's see who else shows up . What more you got ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gap between two o ' the roots on the other side of the tree with C-four , and rolled a rotted log on top of it . That 's on the same circuit as the four Clays on this side of the road . I figure the tree should fall right across the road , dividing whatever force is out there in two . " Clever , thought Hunter , taking another look through the night glasses . The coolies , if that 's who they were , had not moved . " You sure that big tree will fall on the road , Smith ? " " I could n't say for sure , Sarge . If'n I had a coupla sandbags , then for sure , but the log is just kinda wedged on top of the plastic . Lotta blast might just go straight up . " Hunter digested that . It would be nice to be sure of the tree , especially if vehicles did appear , but he knew Smith was as good at making shaped charges in the field as anybody in the battalion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Third screwgee , Sarge , " said Smith . Screwgee was a nickname for the screw detonators . " There 's det cord laid out continuously from twenty meters the other side o ' the tree , a good forty meters this side . Any gook the Clays do n't get who jumps down into that creek is history . " Blown to catsup , mused Hunter . Blown to bits and pieces no bigger than a hand . The thought made him feel slightly queasy . " And the fourth detonator ? " " That 's Trace 's , " said Smith . " I got two Clays facing north , about ten meters up the trail from the bend we 're looking at . I got one more facing east , back toward Smith 's setup , on a claquer , " whispered Trace . " So , we wait , " said Hunter . And they wait , and patrol , and some of them are waiting for us , and looking for us , and if we wait too long , they will find us . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up . " " Right , " whispered Hunter , looking at his watch-02(X) , my turnp259to watch . Moving quickly but quietly , he slid to his belly beside the machine gun . He was about to adjust the night glasses when Trace placed his hand on his , pushing the glasses down quietly . Trace pointed straight ahead . Hunter 's heart stopped , then began to race . Not ten feet away , between their position and the road , was a man , silhouetted in the dim light . The shape disappeared and was immediately replaced by another . Like the first , the second man held the distinctive shape of an AK-47 at the ready . As did the third man , and the fourth . They followed each other with a curious swaying motion , which Hunter thought must make it possible for them to avoid scraping against branches . Hunter 's straining ears could pick up no sound , other than the roaring of his own breathing . The column ended as the last man disappeared from view . On their heads , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Hunter looked at Trace , who looked back . Trace mouthed the letters , N V A. Hunter nodded . The VC wore flatter , conical straw hats , or no hats at all . These men were regular troops of the North Vietnamese Army . Hunter gave Trace the hand sign that meant how many . Trace opened and closed his free hand six times , then held up two fingers . Thirty-two , and doubtless not alone , thought Hunter . Minutes passed that seemed like hours . Hunter consulted his watch twice before 0210 . Just as Hunter felt he was getting his breathing under control , he heard a squeaking sound , as a squad of soldiers moved down the road , pushing a heavily laden cart that looked like it could float like a barge . These soldiers were on the road surface , and were not being at all quiet . I wonder how far ahead the NVA patrol is , thought Hunter . He looked through the binoculars without raising them from the earthwork . He did n't see the soldiers , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next to the tree , and were standing in the middle of the road . He could also see that they were n't all coolies . Jesus , he thought , whatever deal is going down , it is going to happen right under my tree . Then he heard a sound from up the road that was unmistakably the noise of a vehicle grinding in low gear . Holy shit , not a tank , prayed Hunter , not a fucking tank . Trace gripped his arm . His face looked pinched with fear . " What the fuck we gon na do , Billy ? We ca n't blow it , there 's hundreds o ' the fuckers comin ' down the road ! " " We wait , Trace . I hear a vehicle , but I think only one . Hang on . " ! hinter felt " T'race 's grip relax , and the corporal turned hack top260the machine gun . Through the leaves in front of them , Hunter could make out a truck about the size of a marine six by six , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ darkness , the star looked black against the gray truck body , but Billy felt sure it was red . The truck labored under a heavy load of what looked like crates . Billy could see stacks of 82mm mortars on the tailgate of the vehicle , tubes on one side , base plates on the other . The truck labored past , moving at the same speed as the slow-walking soldiers beside it , and stopped right in front of the tree . Men swarmed over it to begin to off-load . A soldier lit a dim lantern to assist the identification of the various crates . " Blow it , " whispered Sergeant Hunter . Smith twisted the first detonator , and an ear-splitting explosion shattered the darkness and silence of the night . The initial explosion seemed to freeze the action in its brilliant flash of light . The truck rocked as it took the impact of the shrapnel , and the man who had been on top of the load flew away in an odd cartwheeling motion . The truck 's fuel tank blew up just as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the four Claymores poured white-hot shrapnel into the mass of the working party . The tree fell forward across the road , striking the front of the burning truck , knocking it back toward the LRRPs . Hunter 's head rang as he struggled up the face of the earthwork with the night binoculars . " Sarge , " asked anyone moving around up there . " There was a flat report and a pale flash in the trees beyond the road as the det cord detonated . For the first time , Hunter heard a man scream . " We got ta di-di , Hunter , " said Trace , urgently . " No shit . Can you rig the last Claymores to trip wires ? " " Already done . Smith , can you shift the leads from my Clays ? Put the taped ones on the battery box . " " Gotcha covered . " From north , up the road , came more vehicle sounds , and sounds of men running and shouting . The enemy soldiers began pouring thick bursts of automatic weapons fire into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned to count his men . " We got time to pick up our extra gear , Sarge ? " whispered Capiello . Hunter heard a distant pop and heard the breathy whistle of a mortar round . He held his breath . There was a loud crash as the mortar round landed in behind their position . " Just wcaperos and canteens . Get moving . Trace , take point . Smith , take the M sixty and the drag and cover ourp261asses . Nobody fires unless we 're spotted . " Heavy machine gun fire raked overhead , causing a fine rain of wet vegetation . " Go , Trace ! " The patrol move off swiftly along the route Trace had scouted earlier . Silence was no longer necessary , but the nightcrawlers still made far less noise than a normal column . Hunter had to admire the way his men kept going , not tripping despite the darkness . Every hazard found by a man was pointed out to the man behind him as the column flowed , feeling its way , but rapidly leaving the sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ double bang as two of Trace 's Claymores were tripped , followed immediately by much heavier firing , now far behind them . As they marched , Hunter got on the radio and called their control in the camp . They were supposed to be radio silent during the mission , but Hunter figured the enemy knew for sure about where they were by now . He gave the grid coordinates of the ambush site , as well as the location of the crossroads where they had found the VC shoe , and asked for some night artillery or naval gunfire to be sent up . He then explained that his patrol had no more Claymores or detonators , and had had to abandon their food and equipment . Control agreed they should come on in . Trace led them nearly due west from the ambush site , until they cut another trail heading south . This was a much narrower track , and bore no signs of recent use . The patrol crouched in silence for twenty minutes in a hollow some ten meters off the trail before Trace , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took a look . Seeing and hearing nothing , Trace signaled the men up , and they began walking down the darkest edge of the trail , spaced five meters apart , pressed into the shadows . The five kilometers back to camp took them two and a half hours . When they reached the cleared perimeter , Hunter radioed their position , and waited for the guard tower to confirm their recognition by the nightwatch light signal . The patrol walked cautiously up to the camp and through the gap the guards had pulled in the concertina wire just as the thin clouds overhead went pink with dawn . The patrol was stood down , but without any indication from the captain as to when they would be going out again . The other probes in the area had reported no unusual enemy movements during the previous night , and were continuing to patrol . It seemed likely that they might have to go up again , and finish hacktrailing the road to the river . Hunter suggested in his report that it Wright he a good idea to send @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and smiled his wintry smile . " Rebuild your field packs , Sergeant Hunter , then rest your men . " " Aye , aye , sir . " Hunter joined Trace and the others in the two twelve-man tents pitched on a raised wooden platform that was their home . He was pleased to see every man in a clean pair of trousers and T-shirt , each man with his new gear unpacked and spread out before him , checking each item , replacing what had been expended or abandoned before rebuilding the pack , ready to go . The M-14s were stacked by their swivels , clean and shiny with oil . The last thing the men would do before moving out would be to rub down the weapons with an old T-shirt with talc on it , to remove the shine . " You learn anything , Sarge ? " asked Phillips . " Not really . The artillery guys on the rockpile pounded the shit outa the ambush site with one-oh-fives half the night . Captain was kinda disappointed we did n't get a body count . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fuck could we have gone out there and counted ? " asked Phillips , incredulous . " It 's a joke , cherry , " said Smith . " Oh , sorry , " said Phillips . " We goin ' up tonight ? " asked Trace , reassembling the M-60 . " He would n't say . Do your packs up , men , then get some rest . " Hunter showered carefully after chow , and put on another clean uniform . The heat of the day had gone quickly , and the chilly dampness returned . He had been up to see the captain just before chow . The captain told him it had been decided that the artillery would fire harassment and interdiction ( H and I ) fire into the areas described by Hunter 's patrol all night , so they would be stood down until morning . " Good , " said Hunter , and immediately regretted it . The captain looked up from the papers on his desk . " You tired of LRRPs , Sergeant Hunter ? " " No , sir ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bit more rest . None of us ever saw that many of the enemy before , sir . " " Of course , Sergeant , " smiled the captain . " But the Air Force will still want that bridge marked , so be ready to go tomorrow . " " Aye , aye , sir . " Asshole makes it sound like we did n't try hard enough , thought Hunter.  |p263Hunter  had reported the news to the men at chow . The men took it without emotion . Some drifted off to the sandbagged hootch that served as an EM club , some went to write letters . Capiello went to chapel . Trace walked into the curtained-off corner of the tent that was Hunter 's tiny bit of privacy . " What you gettin ' dressed up for , Billy ? " " I 'm going to see Nga for a while . " " Hey , no , man ! We 're goin ' out tomorrow ! You and me , we got a rule , remember ? " " I 'm not going to smoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Trace put his hand on Hunter 's forearm . The grip was n't threatening , but it was firm . " Man , Ah Loan wo n't let you fool around with Nga unless you smoke , and smoke plenty . We both know that . " " Ah Loan and I have reached a different understanding , Trace . I wo n't be smoking . " " Yeah . Well , maybe I heard about that different understanding . Do you want to talk about that ? " " No , Trace , I do n't . " Trace let go of Hunter 's arm , and Billy left the tent . I be waiting up for you , man , thought Trace . Hunter 's patrol returned to the scene of the ambush the following afternoon , just as the light was going . Even the NVA had n't been able to clean up the site completely . Swarms of fat , black flies covered broad areas of bloodstains , and the whole area stank of rotting flesh . Bits of charred metal and rubber were spread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big enough to be of any use in identifying the vehicle or any of its former cargo . No bodies were found , but when Capiello turned over a fly-covered piece of rubber with his machete , it turned out to be a human hand . Phillips promptly threw up . The road was badly cratered from the artillery barrages , and more trees were down . " It will take those assholes a week with a bulldozer before they can roll trucks through here again , " commented Da Silva . They inspected their NDP from the previous night , and found that their extra gear and rations were gone , except for one shiny red object . " Hey , they missed my Swiss army knife , " said Phillips . When he reached for it , he found his arm clamped in Trace 's vicelike grip . Phillips face faded to the color of ashes as he looked at Trace . " Wired ? " " Of course , " said ' l'race . " Look . " Trace reached out with his ma/chete and carefully lifted the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wire led from the knife 's ring away into the bushes . " What do we do ? " asked Phillips . " We leave it . You 'll have to get another pocket knife . " Phillips stared at the pocket knife . It was a gift from his mother , and he had carried it since Cub Scouts . " But , should n't we cut it off ? Some other marine might find it . " " We ca n't cut it off , Phillips ; we have no idea how it 's set up . And if we blow it up , we give away our own AO . No , we just leave it . " But what if another marine finds it ? " " Just hope he ai n't a cherry . " Phillips reddened , but said nothing further . Taking great care to give wide berth to the areas where he had set up his own trip wires the previous day , Trace led the patrol through the jungle parallel to the trail as it headed due north . They found a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of two fallen trees , and once again set up the night defensive position and the ambush , and scouted escape routes . Hunter guessed they were no more than a klick from the Ben Hai River itself . We will plant the Air Force 's toys in the morning , he thought , if we are still here . The men passed the night from watch to watch . Shells from the marine fire base at the rockpile rumbled in south of their position at irregular intervals , sounding like distant trains until they exploded . The boom of the explosions was muffled by the intervening jungle . Trace , Hunter , and Smith rotated the watch in three sections , one noncom , one gunner , and one observer in each section . They detected no movement along the trail . Rain , fine and cold , began about 0300 , and continued until dawn . It was so foggy at dawn that Hunter decided to risk a C-4 fire for coffee and instant oatmeal . Capiello had a can of C-ration peaches , which he shared . Split @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helped the flavorless cereal . The men policed the area , disconnected and dug up their Claymores , and rebuilt their packs . Hunter dug up one Claymore himself with a piece of thin bamboo that Trace had made for him when he had first reported to the LRRPs . At Pathfinder School , they had been trained to dig the things up with bayonets , but Trace had told him that the VCp265had learned to defeat that by trailing bits of wire off the contacts on the back of the mine . The bamboo was strong , springy , and nonconductive . Hunter hated digging up mines , even when he knew the detonators had been disconnected , but he made himself stay in practice . By 0600 , they were on the march , moving slowly and quietly through the bush . At 0815 by Hunter 's watch , the patrol was concealed in the bush , twenty meters off the trail and five meters from the muddy , sluggish waters of the Ben Hai . The men regarded the southern border of North Vietnam with curiosity and awe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the borders of hell . Trace and Smith were opening up the green plastic cylinders that contained the air force remote-activated position repeaters , called RAPS . Each was about ten inches high and three inches in diameter . On the bottom was a sharp spike , and on the top , a quartet of stubby antennas . " How these mothafuckas work , Trace ? " asked Smith . " Says on the side . Just stick it in the ground where it wo n't be seen . Twist the top collar a half turn to the right ; that activates it . Antenna part got to be at least five inches outa the ground . " Trace held the camouflage-painted cylinder aloft . Piece of shit , he said to himself . " What 's the plan , Sarge ? " Hunter looked at the repeater . Hope these fuckers work , he thought ; lotta risk to get them here . " Well , they gave us four of them , so I guess they want two on each side of the river . " Everybody peered through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is it , you reckon ? " whispered Da Silva . " Got ta be half a mile , " said Capiello . " Less , " said Smith , " maybe five , six hundred meters . So who feels like a morning swim ? " Nobody volunteered . Hunter spoke softly , " Let 's do this side first , in case we get chased away . " " Chased away or just plain fucked up , " whispered Smith . " We just have to wade in . If there really is a road , the water wo n't be more than chest deep . If there ai n't no road , then fuck it , we go home . " Hunter watched as the men looked at each other and at him . They knew there had to be a road ; they had all seen the truck go down the trail three nights before . Trace and Smith placed a repeater on either side of the road . It was a quick job , with nothing to wire . When Trace crossed the road , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sensation . Everyonep266looked expectantly at Hunter , who held the last two repeaters in his hands . Gradually the animals returned to their calling . The day was becoming hot . Leadership time , thought Hunter . " I guess I 'll run these doodads over myself . Trace , tie the end of the wire reel to my belt . " Trace looked uneasy . " I 'll go , Sergeant , ' sides , we got the climbing rope . " " Nowhere near long enough . Just hook me up , there is n't much current , anyway . " Hunter had shucked his boots and socks , and his shirt and T-shirt . " Hell , Sergeant , wading across will take forever , " spoke up Phillips , a little too loudly . " Let me swim those things across . " " Attaboy , Phillips , " said Trace quickly . Hunter held his green T-shirt in front of him , uncertain as to whether to take the cherry up on his offer . " You swim good , Phillips ? " Phillips grinned . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sarge . All we did as kids was surf . And I was on the swimming team at college . " " What college ? " asked Hunter . " San Jose State . I , ah , only did two years . " " You can make it OK ? " " Hey , no sweat ! Be back in fifteen minutes ! " Phillips stripped to his trousers . Trace went over the arming procedure with him , and helped him secure the repeaters around his waist . " Be careful , kid , " said Smith , bringing up the wire . " Forget the wire , Smith , " said Phillips , confidently , " I 'd rather have my legs free . " Smith looked at Hunter , a question on his face . Hunter nodded . " Phillips , every fifty meters or so , let your legs down . See if there 's a road surface , and if so , what it feels like . " " OK , Sarge , " grinned Phillips . " Do n't stand up , just let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and lowered himself into the brown water . Soon he was pulling himself into midstream with powerful , graceful , silent strokes . " Cherry 's gon na make history , Bro , " said Smith to Trace , quietly . " First American gyrene to visit the North . " The patrol watched as Phillips stroked across the river , stopping from time to time to probe the bottom with his feet . The birds were calling in sharp notes that seemed like warnings . The monkeys began screeching in a new tone , then dropped their voices in a low chatter.  |p267Hunter  watched through the night binoculars , whose big objectives gave the water a bright , coppery sheen . He was thinking of snakes and crocodilesbeneath the surface . If I were out there now , I 'd be scared shitless . Phillips reached the shadow of the trees on the opposite bank before he reached the bank itself , and for ten anxious minutes , he was out of sight . Trace listened intently for a shot , or a cry from the opposite bank . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gets in trouble , he thought . Phillips finally emerged into the sunlit river , stroking strongly . He apparently thought he had done enough surveying of the road , for he did not stop . Nevertheless , his progress seemed slow , as though an unseen current were dragging him back . Come on , kid , thought Hunter , staring at Phillips 's swiveling head and stroking arms . " Come on , Phillips , " whispered Smith , out loud . Now all the men were up , inching toward the bank . " Come on , man ! " Phillips reached the bank in the middle of the road , and strode slowly out of the water . He did not seem winded , and he was still grinning . Smith waded in up to the tops of his boots , and put his arm around Phillips 's shoulder , pulling him back to the others . " Good job , kid . " Phillips just nodded , and Hunter could see that he was winded , after all . " Strip him down , Smith , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Phillips ? " " Road feels like gravel , about three feet underwater , all the way across . On the other side , there are a lot of tire marks , right down to the riverbank . " Smith had Phillips 's trousers down and was toweling him off . " Well , Phillips , " said Hunter with a smile , very glad Phillips was back on the near side of the river , " I guess the gooks never figured a mad marine killing machine would ever have the balls to swim over and take a look . Well done , Marine . " " Thank you , Sarge  --  ah-YAOOW ! " " What the fuck ? " said Hunter , seeing Phillips double over and clutch his groin . Smith held up a black and white leech easily three inches long . " He had this of leech right next to his dick , Sergeant . I could n't be sure , so I just ripped off the smaller of the two . " Smith held the fat leech under its bloody mouth , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recoiled , then he reached for the leech , threwp268it on the ground , and crushed it under his bare heel . Smith held Phillips by both cheeks and they grinned at each other . " Welcome to the LRRPs , Marine . " " OK , " said Hunter , " get some ointment on the bite , and let 's clear out of here . " The patrol withdrew along the opposite side of the trail from the one they had come up , looking for signs of the enemy 's traffic . They detected nothing of value until they were nearly back to the site of the ambush , where they found a body , already badly decomposed . He had wounds on his legs and back , Hunter guessed from the Claymores . " Fucker crawled a long way , " commented Smith . Hunter took papers from the man 's tunic to give to intelligence . " He must have crawled so far the others could n't find him . They never leave bodies unless they 're driven off . " " Them papers make him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know . Got ta picture , probably so . Let 's go . " They drew up beneath the shattered trunk of the tree that had been the focal point of the ambush . " Let 's just take one more look at the blast sight , " said Hunter , quietly . Trace nodded , then crept to the edge of the trail , lying still and listening . Satisfied that there was no enemy near , he hand-signed the men forward . One by one , the men emerged and fanned out . Hunter looked around in disbelief . The big tree had been cut up and the logs removed to the sides of the trail . Smaller trees and branches knocked down by the artillery had also been cleaned up , and more impressively , shell craters , which had been full of dirty water when they had passed by eighteen hours before , had been filled with packed earth . The area where the truck had blown up was covered with new earth as well . " The place looks like it 's been fuckin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get by us last night ? " asked Capiello . " They might have come from the south of here . Local VC , like the coolies the other night , " said Trace . " Hey , look ! " called Phillips , pointing at the jagged stump of the downed tree . Stuck into the stump about two feet above the ground was Phillips 's Swiss army knife . " How the fuck did that get here ? " " Did n't walk , " remarked Trace , dryly . Hunter 's throat was tight . He could almost feel the eyes of the men who had cleaned up the ambush and left the knife pressing intop269his back . The men moved in a loose circle , looking outward . " It 's a signal , that 's for sure . Says they know it 's us , know we 're here . " " What it says is Fuck you , LRRPs , ' " put in Trace . " You gon na take it , Phillips ? " Phillips took a step closer . " Watch your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and looked down . " Could it still be booby-trapped ? " " I do n't see how , but it could . " Smith took out a lined pad he carried in his pack , and a marking pen . He often drew cartoons for the guys , and sometimes he sketched flowers . " Leave it , kid ; I 'll get you a real knife . " Smith drew a series of characters across the page . They looked like a string of x 's and n 's with no tops and long tails . The last character was an exclamation point . Smith tore the page from the book , and cut a hook in the top with his razor-sharp spring-steel knife . Holding the paper on the point of the knife , he reached out and hooked it over the Swiss army knife . " Now at least it says Fuck you ' in Vietnamese as well . " " Let 's di-di , " said Trace . " This place gives me the shits . " Without waiting for any acknowledgment , he led @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they kept well off the road until they once again cut the small trail that intersected the big one . They followed the small trail south , and were back in the camp by 1500.  |p270Hunter  had n't really found dealing for Ah Loan difficult , once he started . He never pushed anyone , just let it be known to a few trusted friends that if they wanted a smoke , he could help them . Ah Loan himself , to do him credit , was not anxious to make waves ; he did occasionally try to convince Billy to move up-market , at least to five-sixths , but when Billy declined , Ah Loan smiled his gold-toothed smile , and let it go . Billy was able to see Nga nearly every night when his patrol squad was stood down , which made him happy . She had never quite reached the level of boldness she had the night of Ah Loan 's proposal , but Billy was content to think she had frightened herself as she had frightened him , and besides , he liked her fine as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ setting out to see Nga after three days in the bush when a jeep stopped in front of him , blocking his path . The driver was a scowling coal-black corporal in pressed utilities . Next to him sat a small , elegant , very light skinned black man with a pencil mustache and conked reddish hair , with the insignia of a first sergeant on his crisply pressed collar points . Billy stopped dead . He had never seen the man , but recognized him immediately from the stories he had heard . He was the Topkick of Headquarters Company , 1st of the 9th Marines , Henry " Whitenigger " Johnson . In the hack seat of the jeep sat the ugliest man Hunter had ever seen , easily six feet five inches tall , if hisp271legs lived up to his torso , and fat , with his coarse features broken by angry red sores . He had thick , wet lips , and one of those mouths that just hangs open . Next to him , pinned under his thick fleshy elbow , was a thin marine named @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoke quietly , around a cigarette , which dangled theatrically from the corner of his mouth . " Sar n't Hunta ! " The voice was between a whistle and a rasp . " A word . " Hunter stepped to the jeep . He had sold a couple of joints to Johanssen just that morning . Here it goes , he thought , his heart cold . " Sar n't Hunta , thiss man , thiss ma-rive tells me he bo't some maryjuanafom yo . I , pee-sonally , be sorry to think such be true . " Whitenigger looked sad , and happy , and insincere , all at the same time . Billy looked at the scared face of Johanssen , then back at the sergeant . " What do you want , Sergeant ? " " Selling , dealing , drugs is highly illegal , Sar n't . " Shit , thought Hunter , I 'm busted . It all seemed so easy . " I was just helping out a few friends , Sergeant . " " Illegally . " " Perhaps . So what ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , send me to Nam ? Whitenigger looked interested . " I think it better , Sar n't Hunter , if we had an informal , unofficial talk . My office ? " Whitenigger gestured Hunter to climb into the jeep . At the same signal , the ugly mountain in the back seat released the skinny marine , making room for Hunter . Johanssen fled . Hunter thought about it , and very slowly climbed into the jeep . " Very sensible , Sar n't , " hissed Whitenigger . " Where we goin ' ? " " Just ' cross the way , to our encampment , Billy . May I call you Billy ? " " Suit yourself , " said Billy , his voice reflecting his surly despair . " Ex'lent . " The jeep sped through the open gate of Camp Seven , across the kilometer separating it from the next concertina wire  --  encircled camp , Camp Five , where the 2d Company , 1st of the 9th Marines , as well as the Headquarters and Headquarters Company and a transport company were billeted . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dust before a sturdily built hootch , canvas over wood , on a raised wooden platform.  | " Here , Sar n't , " said Johnson . Billy Hunter got down , and entered without a word . The silent black corporal and the ugly monster followed . The hootch had the look of a home more than an office . There was a bunk , neatly made up , on the left side , and several beat-up soft chairs . There was even a rug on the floor . The back wall of the hootch was covered with neat bookshelves , filled with books with lurid covers . First Sergeant Johnson sat down behind an elaborate brass-bound camp desk of dark , polished wood , and motioned to Hunter to take a seat in front of the desk . The black corporal and the wet-lipped giant stood behind Billy , unseen . Billy could hear the labored breathing of the fat man . Be calm , he told his racing heart . Johnson unbuttoned a pocket on his shirt and withdrew a tightly rolled joint , which he placed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and smoothed the flap . He put his thin , carefully maintained hands on the desk , making a steeple with his fingers behind the joint . " This the joint yo ' sol ' that ma-rine , Sar n't Hunta ? This the one ? " Billy said nothing . What would be the point ? " Say he pay you fitty cents . " Billy looked into Johnson 's yellowish eyes . The pupils were light brown , flat , and dead . " That 's a problem , for yo ' and for me , Sar n't . " Billy sighed . Let 's get on with it , he thought . " Why is it a problem for you , Sergeant ? " " This a small marketplace , Sar n't . Need discipline . No room for com-pe-ti-shun ! " " Even small-time competition , " growled the corporal behind Billy 's ear . " Guy like yo ' , Sar n't , coming in , sellin ' who-know-what kinda shit , way off market price , makes the whole thing dangerous for the people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whitenigger spread his fine hands on the desk top , palms up . His palms were a sandy-pink color . So this is n't a bust , thought Billy . " What do you want from me , Sergeant ? " " Co-operation , " said Johnson , with a slight smile . " Respect , " growled the corporal . Billy could actually feel the man 's breath on the back of his neck . The giant giggled . Billy sighed again . " I do n't want trouble with you , Sergeant . "  |p273Whitenigger  's hands made the steeple again . " Of coss not . Let 's to bid-ness , then ? " " I asked you , Sergeant , what do you want ? " " Yo wan na sell dope , you sell dope . My dope . " " And we 'll need to know where you bin gettin ' your shit , " growled the corporal , from inches behind Billy 's ear . Billy felt the skin on the back of his neck crawl . This is worse than getting busted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ah , doing it ? " Whitenigger shrugged , " No reason yo ' should , Sar n't . Long as yo ' co-operate . " " We still need to talk to your supplier , dude , " breathed the corporal . Billy got up quickly , turned , and placed his hand flat on the corporal 's chest , shoving him backward . The man lost his balance , regained it , and lowered himself into a martial-arts crouch , his teeth bared . Billy tried very hard to stare the corporal down . " Now , gennlemen ! " purred Whitenigger , " this a bid-ness meetin ' ! " " I do n't need this asshole breathing down my neck , " said Hunter , firmly . " You don ' need none of the trouble I got for you , white meat , " spat the corporal through his clenched teeth . Billy turned , very slowly and half expecting an attack from behind , to face Johnson , who was now standing behind the spotless desk . Whiteniggersmiled pleasantly . Billy spoke softly , holding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this discussion one on one , Sergeant ? " Billy felt his anger rising , and decided to show it . Whitenigger did not seem impressed . " Why not ? That seems very sensible , Sar n't ! Crow , Zits , go get a beer , then bring back a couple for me and the sar n't here . " Billy turned , and watched the other two slide out of the office . The corporal 's hatefilledeyes never left Billy until the door closed . Johnson sat . " So what do yo ' pro pose , Sar n't Hunta ? " Johnson picked up the joint from the desk , gestured with it in Hunter 's face , then lit it , pulling a deep toke into his lungs . He hoisted his feet onto the desk , and smiled . " Look , Sergeant  --  " " Call me Whitenigga . " Hunter choked . Why would anyone want such a name ?  | " Bothers yo ' , do n't it , fa'mboy ? " " No . Fine , Whitenigger , if you like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I know you got , well , influence  --  " " Power , " said Whitenigger , drawing Ah Loan 's smoke deep into his lungs , " power . " Hunter chose his words carefully . My ass is on the line , he thought , and so is my ability to see and to protect Nga . " Thing is , Sergeant , ah , Whitenigger , I do n't want trouble from you . Hell , I 'm not even doing this to make any money . " Whitenigger offered the joint to Billy . He waved it off . " Lak , no shit , Hunta , at fitty cents a J , you ai n't goin ' to make none . " Hunter smiled ruefully . " You think I 'm dumb . " " Yep , " said Whitenigger , exhaling a great cloud of pungent smoke . " Well , " said Billy , " fact is , I kinda love this girl . So her father , he wants money for me just to be with her , see ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So he asked me to sell dope . Just a little . " " A little too much , Sar n't Billy . " " OK . OK , Whitenigger , " the name stuck in Billy 's throat . " I got ta buy the guy 's dope , and I ca n't afford to throw it away . So how about I sell it to you , like at my cost ? " Whitenigger offered the joint again . Billy thought it best to take it , a sign of bargain . The smoke was much rougher than the stuff Billy had smoked at Ah Loan 's , but it was good . " I don ' know , Billy , that would make yo ' almos ' a partner . " " I do n't want nothing , man , just to see the girl . " Whitenigger leaned forward . " Yo gon na tell me who is this supplier ? " " I ca n't , man . " " Hard , hard do bidness , wit'out trust , " said Whitenigger , leaning back . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for me , and for my girl . " " And yo ' will stop dealing ? " Billy hated the word " dealing . " " Yeah . " Whitenigger smiled his insincere half smile . His eyelids drooped . " I am sure we will work something out . Trust me , Billy . " Billy smiled , " Yeah , well , I want to . Just keep that corporal awayfrom me , OK , Sergeant ? " " He could take you . "  | " Maybe . " Billy 's smile evaporated . " If things did n't go well . " " But they will , wo n't they , Whitenigger ? " " Of coss-ss . " Whitenigger 's voice had all the menace of a snake 's hiss . Billy got up . " OK , then , we 'll work it out . " Whitenigger smiled . Billy could see his eyes were still dead . " Stay for a beer . " " No , thanks , Sergeant . I 'm late for an appointment . I 'll just get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " As you wish , Billy . " Hunter threw a half salute with a smile , and left . Now , that did n't go half badly , he thought , relieved to be out of Whitenigger 's office with a whole skin . In the office , First Sergeant Johnson seethed with rage . Fucking patronizing asshole racist cracker , he thought . First I 'm going to let you live , and then I 'm going to fill that life with pain . Crow reentered the office , almost silently , carrying a paper sack full of cold beers . He looked quickly around the office , saw Hunter had gone , and came forward , setting the sack on Whitenigger 's desk . Wordlessly , he took two cans of beer from the sack , and opened them . They each drank . Whitenigger extended his soft hand , and Crow took it in both of his . " Find out what slope-head chick our read ' - mix sar n't is fucking , Crow . Find out ! That will lead us to his supply . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ withdrew . Whitenigger took another joint from the desk , and lit it . God , I hate these cocky white bastards , he whispered to the joint . Hunter 's Pathfinder unit was split between two marine corps CH-34 helicopters , skimming over the treetops on the way back to Camp Seven . The entire battalion had been involved in an operation called Jackstay II , joined by two other battalions of I Corps marines and a battalion landing team from the amphibious squadron offshore . The operation was a sweep , intended to force the enemy to retreat from his bases in the many jungle valleys west of the Leatherneck Square . Hunter 's company had been picked up by helicopters seven days previously and lifted to a nondescript hilltop called Landing Zone Stud , where they formed a blocking force for the mobile units from the BLT . Hunter and the other nightcrawlers felt like fish out of water in the big , company/sized actions , with helicopters , artillery , air strikes , resupply , noise , and daylight movement . The Pathfinder unit was operated as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and so noisy that the nightcrawlers were confident that the enemy would be nowhere in evidence . The operation ground through the week in the growing heat of the early southeast monsoon season . The men got wet and stayed wet , and stank and cursed . Insect repellent was a major item on each resupply list . Leeches were a problem , especially when the men tried to sleep . There was a rumor that one of the men from the 1/9 had a leech crawl halfway up his cock . Hunter 's company came under a night mortar attack , which was terrifying even though no one was hurt . Hunter watched as the company commander called in artillery on the opposite wall of the little valley to suppress the mortars , and admired his coolness . The men got more tired and more irritable , and many VC sightings were cause for thousands of rounds of ammunition to be loosed into the jungle , but no bodies were found . Supply caches were found , and the rice dumped out or contaminated with aviation gasoline . A tunnel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uncovered , and dynamited after many pictures were taken . The colonel commanding the operation made a speech to a small group of correspondents on the pad at LZ Stud , while marines , including the nightcrawlers , maintained a double perimeter . The colonel listed the accomplishments of the operation in terms of tons of rice and rounds of ammunition found and destroyed , individual and crew-served weapons captured , kilometers marched , and square kilometers denied the enemy . American casualties were two KIA , both due to mines , and fourteen WIA . Enemy casualties were put preliminarily at twenty KIA . Hunter did n't know where those enemy kills had occurred , and he had n't heard about them from anybody else . The colonel counted the operation a success . The marines withdrew to the strong points , and from there , the BLT flew back to the ships . Hunter 's company , holding the perimeter at LZ Stud , was among the last flown out . The helicopters banked in and landed , four at a time , in the middle of Camp Seven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for their hootches . Billy went off to a final debrief with the other senior NCOs and the officers at the captain 's office . The debrief was short , with each unit leader giving a quick comment on the performance of men and equipment under his control . The captainp277took it all in , and his company personnel sergeant took minutes . At the close , the captain signaled for silence . The tired men were pleased to comply . " Men , while we were out , there was an incident here , at our camp . The ville beyond the wire was attacked by VC infiltrators . " The ville ? thought Hunter . Oh , my God , no . " The vine 's headman , old Loan , and his family , were killed . " Jesus , Mary , and Joseph , prayed Hunter . It can not be . " What about the sentries in the towers ? " asked a voice . Hunter belatedly recognized it as his own . " They saw nothing , Hunter , heard nothing . To those of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Dis-missed . " The captain left the tight circle of officers and NCOs . Hunter turned and hurried toward the Pathfinder 's hootch , his mind racing and his guts burning . " Trace . TRACE ! " Trace appeared at the flap of the tent , jumped down , and grabbed Hunter by the shoulders . " You heard . " " Jesus , yeah ! Let 's get up there ! " " It 's cordoned off . It 's off-limits . " Hunter shook free . " Let 's go , dammit ! " He ran , and Trace followed . Trace and Hunter walked around the little hut village , followed by frightened eyes in every doorway . Every doorway except the doorways of Ah Loan , his ancient crippled wife , and the " daughters . " Yellow plastic military police ribbons encircled the hootches , but Hunter was not deterred . There were no military personnel in the ville . The sentries in the nearest tower watched them without interest . Hunter knelt in the trampled mud , and picked up a fake tortoise-shell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Nga . There was glossy black hair on the comb , and blood on the hair . Billy held the comb in both hands , then slipped it into his shirt pocket . " Let 's go , man ! " whispered Trace . Billy shook a tear from his eye , " Wait , man . Wait . " Trace took Hunter 's arm . " Man , everybody is looking at us ! " Hunter shook free . " Look around you , Trace ! VC do n't leave a place like this ! " Trace looked . The hootches had n't been stripped . The blood spoor was not in a neat execution row . " Look , man , who the fuck else coulda done this ? And why ? " " I do n't know . But look . Blood is all over the hootches , like some one came in cutting , slashing . You know the VC would have takenp278everyone out , then executed them . Maybe mutilated the bodies , pour encourager les autres , like the French taught them . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the usual form , to set an example . You know that , Trace . " Trace looked around . It was too messy . " Maybe they had to do it quick , because of the sentries in the towers . " " The sentries ! The ones who heard nothing , saw nothing ! Trace , you know this was n't done quietly ! You know ! " Hunter let Trace hustle him back to the hootch . Hunter 's face was hot , and he felt the aches in his back and legs that heralded a malaria attack . His mind was racing , filled alternately with grief and rage . He forced himself through the routine tasks of the stand down , stripping his pack and his weapon , organizing his dirty clothes , showering thoroughlythrough seven days of sweat and jungle slime , delousing his head and his crotch , showering again . He tried to focus on the scene in Ah Loan 's little compound . A thousand things that seemed out of place shrieked through his mind , yet when he tried to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watching him intently as he dressed . Trace thinks I 'm crazy . Trace knows I 'm not crazy . But who would kill Ah Loan and  --  the others . Billy knew he was fighting admitting to himself that Nga herself could be dead . " Let 's go eat , Billy , " said Trace , eyeing him gravely . " OK . " Billy forced a smile . They ate in silence . Most of the marines in the mess tent were wolfing down their first decent meal in a week , so the silence was n't conspicuous . Billy tried to eat ; he felt hungry , but he was just too distracted . Images of Nga , her child 's body broken and twisted , forced their way into his brain , and he tried to squeeze them out . Too much to do , too much to find out , before he could grieve for Nga . He hoped she would understand . Trace finished , and they got up to go back to their hootch . He 's watching me like a hawk , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hey , Trace , why are you looking at me like I have leprosy ? " " You do n't look well , Bro . You 're flushed , and you 're sweating . You better get some lie-down . " Hunter shook his head , and increased his pace . Trace kept up . " Igotta find out , man . I got ta talk to people , find out what really happened . " Trace stopped him just inside the tent and spun him around . Hisvoice was hard and even , though very quiet . " Now listen , Sergeant !  |p279The  VC killed those people ! The fucking VC ! That 's what happened , and that 's all ! " Hunter looked at his friend . Trace looked more scared than angry . " Trace , I know you want to protect me from any association with Ah Loan and drugs , but you saw that mess . The VC do n't leave a site like that . " " We do n't know that , man ! For all we know , the MPs messed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I just want to ask around . Find those so-called sentries , for one thing . " " Well , you ai n't a-gonna , Billy Hunter , because you 're sick , and your head is on crooked . You go to bed before you do something stupid . " Hunter bowed his head . He squeezed his eyes shut against his own tears and against a picture of Nga , frightened , being attacked with a machete . A groan escaped his mouth , and he shook his head . " You got ta get a grip on yourself , man . " Trace 's voice was gentle , comforting . He led Hunter toward his little enclosure , holding him tightly around his shaking shoulders . " You go to bed , get the fever down . I 'll , ah , ask around . " " Pro-promise , " rasped Hunter , allowing himself to be lowered into his cot . " Yeah . I will . Sleep . " " Thanks , Trace . " Trace pulled off Hunter 's boots , and pulled the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought ; he really loved that little girl . Hunter slept fitfully , the fever distorting the images in his brain . A corpsman , sent by Trace , came in and took Hunter 's temperature , then made him drink a canteen full of water and gave him three aspirin . Sleep and water , said the corpsman . Hunter nodded and drifted off again . The incident at Ah Loan 's place slipped away from him , and his fevered brain slept . Billy took a long shower and returned to his quarters , and dressed . His temperature was almost down to normal , but he felt weak as a kitten . He felt hunger , but the thought of food made his stomach churn . He sat on the bunk and shook his head to clear it . Trace walked in , with Smith . " How you ( loin ' Hunter ? " asked Smith . He looked concerned . " I 'm OK . Little weak . Few hours sleep took care of it . "  | " You bin out more'n twenty-four hours , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that never happened before . " Wow . " " Corpsman came by coupla times , made sure your temperature did n't stay too high for too long , fry your brain , " continued Trace . " He said it ai n't that unusual , you bein ' tired from seven days in the bush . " Hunter shook his head again . It would n't clear . " Twenty-four hours ! Hey , Trace , did you find out  --  " he stopped , and looked uncertainly at Smith . Smith had never been admitted as one of Ah Loan 's " friends . " " Yeah . Some . I tole Smith what you were thinkin ' . We trust Smith . " It was a flat statement . Trace was taking charge . " Figured we 'd both talk to you . " Hunter leaned back . " So what did you find out ? " Neither Trace nor Smith would look him in the eye . " Billy , this is from the heart . I know how you felt about little Nga , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you wo n't do anything stupid . " Billy felt chilled to the bone . A last lick of malaria , he thought . " Trace , what did you find out ? " " Promise . I mean it , man , promise . " Billy 's throat was dry and his vision was blurring . " I promise . " Trace took a deep breath , and let it out . " Billy , you was right . VC never hit that place . " " Who ? " rasped Billy . Trace sat down beside him on the cot . " Who ? " " A guy named Crow and another they call Zits . They 're close to Whitenigger Johnson . " Oh , my God , thought Hunter , clutching himself around the elbows . " What happened to the sentries ? That near tower is n't ten meters away from  --  " " Who knows ? With the combat units in the field , probably just clerks up there anyway . Or maybe bribed . You know Whitenigger draws a lot of water , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ah Loan . And they killed him , and  --  his family , even though I said I would go along , they killed them , all . Billy fought the pain , but gave in to the tears . " Are you sure , Trace ? " " Yeah . But remember , you promised not to try anything . There is nothing you can do . " " Bu-but it 's murder ! We-we ca n't j-just let it go ! " " Billy , what are you going to do ? Turn them in ? There are nop281witnesses , and the investigation will probably find out about you dealin ' for Ah Loan . " He does n't know the worst of it , thought Hunter . " I warned you about that dealin ' , Billy . " Billy straightened himself up on the cot . " How do you know this , Trace ? " " Smith did some nosin ' around in Camp Five . Nobody knows him over there . Heard that guy , Zits , bragging about it . " Hunter looked at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Smith grimaced and looked at Trace . " Like Trace said , Sarge . We was in the latrine , but Zits could n't see me . He said him and Crow wasted this old drug dealer . " Billy took a deep breath . " Di-did he mention Nga ? " Smith squirmed . He looked at Trace , not at Hunter , " Hey , Sarge , you do n't want to hear it all . Prob'ly not even true , anyway . " " I want to hear . I want to know . " Hunter heard his own voice full of pain , but resolute . " Billy , it wo n't bring her back , " whispered Trace , putting his arm across Billy 's shoulders . " I have a right . I want to know . What did he say about Nga ? " Smith 's face contorted with real pain , and he closed his eyes . " He said that Crow held the little gook for him , but he could n't fuck her ; she was just too small . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her skull with h-his machete . " It all came out in a rush . Hunter just stared at Smith in horror . Very slowly , and without a sound , Hunter doubled over , clutching his gut tightly . Burning bile from his stomach rose in his mouth , and dribbled out onto his knees . He could n't breathe ; his solar plexus was paralyzed as from a physical blow . Still holding Hunter around his shoulders , Trace gestured with his head to Smith , who went out and returned with the corpsman , who dabbed alcohol on Billy 's clenched elbow and injected the tranquilizer he had prepared . He watched anxiously as Billy resumed breathing , then slid to the floor . Trace and Smith pulled him back onto the cot , and the corpsman checked him over . " He 'll sleep again , but we better take him over to the sick bay . " " Jesus , he made me tell him , " whispered Smith . " I know , Bro , " said Trace . " But it was better he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later on . " " But what a thing to have to know . "  | " He 'll make it , he 's strong . We 'll have to help him . Anyway , let 's get him over to sick bay . Pick up that end of the cot . " Hunter swam underwater for the longest time . He could see the surface of the pool , dotted with lily pads , just above him . He did not come up to breathe , but he felt no shortness of breath . He swam on , the grasses and sunken branches tugging at his body , frightening him . Terror stared at him with glowing eyes behind the swaying grasses . Yet the water was warm , and the sensation of swimming pleasant . And in the back of his mind , he knew far greater horrors waited above the surface . He was vaguely aware of being in a hospital , and of people moving around , and stopping to look at him . They were hard to make out above the water 's surface . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a tube stuck in at the elbow , even though he could n't really feel it . He did feel straps across his legs and chest . He supposed they were for safety . He vaguely recalled falling out of his own bed some time ago . Nga swam up to meet him from among the waving leaves of grass . She smiled her joyful smile and extended her arms toward him . Billy felt happy as he enfolded her in his right arm . She drifted close to him , almost touching his face . He stroked her shiny black hair , but it was sticky and warm on the back of her head . He looked at his hand , and saw blood and brain tissue . Nga continued to smile at him , but her eyes were open in terror . He realized she was dead . He opened his mouth to scream , but his mouth filled with water and he choked . Nga drifted away , spinning weightless in the current . It was nighttime in the hospital . It was dark around Billy 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's head rang with fever , but he was beginning to see more clearly . A corpsman with a clipboard came to the side of Billy 's bed , and looked at him , grinning . It was Crow , and he was saying something Billy could n't hear , and laughing . Billy recoiled , tried to sink into the mattress . Crow bent over , his face becoming huge , and kissed Billy on the forehead , laughing all the while . Billy struggled to cry out , but his lungs were empty , and he could n't get a breath . Crow 's head withdrew , and Billy could see the bloated , blistered face of Zits , who leaned over from the other side of the bed . Zits unbuttoned his fly and pulled out his cock , pointing it at Billy . It was dripping with blood . Billy twisted against the restraints of the bed , and managed a low cry of " nu-un-unh ! " Ile opened his eyes , and Crow and Zits had gone.  |p283Nga  sat beside him on the bed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far away for him to touch . When he beckoned to her , she shook her head , and frowned . The frown cut through Billy like a knife . " Come , my love . " " I ca n't , Bi-lee . Otha ma-rive ruin Nga . " " No , child , come to me . " " Otha ma-rive , he take Nga 's virginity . Now Nga can not give to Bi-lee . " " That does n't matter , Nga . " " Yes it does . All man want virgin . Now Nga can not have love of Bi-lee . " She stood up and walked away . He called after her , but the words stuck in his throat . Nga drifted in and out of his vision the rest of the long night , but she would n't come to him . He could see she thought he had failed her , and he knew that he had . He should have gotten her away from Ah Loan . She was raped and killed because he had failed . Toward morning there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wind chime , " Help me , Bi-lee . Help me to rest . " Hunter was wide awake and his mind was clear when the lights came on in the sick bay at 0600 . He knew with perfect clarity what he had to do.  |p284Lieutenant  ( jg ) William McGowen Stuart stood at attention at the foot of the garden , squinting into the sun setting over the gold-dappled Pacific . He was sweating slightly from the sun , and from nerves . The high collar of his starched dress-white uniform pulled his neck like a noose , and he wished he could raise a hand and give it a tug to loosen it , but he did not . Lieutenant Hooper stood next to him , and Lts. ( jg ) Buck Thomas , Gordy Mason , and David Epstein , and Ens . Barry Fiedler stood in a curving line beyond , facing five very pretty bridesmaids in a curve on the other side of the priest . Everybody waited for the bride to make her entry . Karen and her father should appear at any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stage , thought Stuart . We are the main event . Let the show begin ; let 's get this done . The garden , and the sprawling house behind the wedding party , sat on a low bluff overlooking Balboa Island and the Newport Breakwater . It belonged to Karen 's Aunt Liz , her mother 's sister . Karen and her parents had decided to have the wedding on the West Coast to allow more of William 's friends to be present , and because Karen had made many friends since beginning her job with the Bank of America . Karen 's maid of honor and one of her bridesmaids had flown out from the East , as had Karen 's parents and her two brothers . William 's parents had made a visit to San Francisco , and then had driven down from Palop285Alto with William 's sister and her husband . The total number of guests was about one hundred and fifty . Dinner and dancing would follow the ceremony . " So where is the lovely Karen , William ? My thirst grows to dangerous proportions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouth . " Quiet , Hoop . We 're on stage here , " whispered Stuart through his fixed smile . A drink would not be amiss in my too-tight guts , he thought . " Look at Epstein ! He 's positively drooling ! There 's going to be some serious womanizing after you two lovebirds fly off tonight , " continuedHooper , not to be quieted . " Shut up , man ! " Stuart suppressed a grin . David Epstein was definitelyin full mating display . " I think ole Gordy diddled the maid of h last night , after your fine speech at the rehearsal dinner . " Stuart fought back a guffaw . He turned a bit toward his tormentor , who was grinning his wolfish best , just as a long chord swelled from the electric organ on the porch behind them , and Karen and her father emerged from the guest house across the lawn . They marched slowly together down the aisle between the rows of smiling guests . Stuart 's mind blanked to all sensation except the sight of Karen , truly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's measured tread , in time to the march William could no longer hear . He was aware that she was wearing a dress of heavy silk , the color of thick cream , and a diamond cross around her neck , and a tiara holding a veil , and that she was carrying a long bouquet of orchids . The rest was just Karen , more beautiful than he had ever seen her . William turned and took Karen 's arm as her father , his eyes misty , stepped back and sat beside his wife . The priest began the ceremony , and William and Karen made the responses on cue , William as if from a deep trance . The only thing he noticed as the ceremony progressed , and the only thing he would remember , was the ring , borne by Aunt Liz 's youngest son in a crystal dish . The kid was so nervous that the ring clattered and danced in the dish , until the priest took it up and handed it to William , who slipped it onto Karen 's poised finger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought William , feeling proud to be so close to this magnificent woman . Jesus , I 'm marrying her , right now ! He felt a twinge of panic . The priest told him he could kiss the bride , and Karen tilted her head up to him , eyes half closed , lips slightlyp286parted . William drew her to him , lifted the gossamer veil , and kissed her . The electric organ began to play again , and Karen gently turned William toward the multitude . William took one step forward , and felt his dress sword catch in Karen 's dress . He reached down and freed it , and they marched slowly down the lawn toward the gleaming harbor , to the stirring strains of Handel . William was vaguely aware of the ushers and bridesmaids forming up behind them as they walked down to the guest house from which Karen had emerged with her father about ten minutes ago . They stepped into the cool darkness , and William really kissed the bride . Karen giggled and pushed him away slightly . " My , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his crotch teasingly through the tight cloth of his white trousers . William held her wrist . " Do-do you suppose we could , ah , slip away for a few moments ? " " And loosen our garments ? " " Ah , as the saying goes , yes . " Karen put her hands on his cheeks and kissed him lightly . " There 's nothing I 'd like better , my husband , but I think the standard response is that we have a lifetime to be doing that . " William smiled , beginning to feel somewhat in control . His heart slowed to a medium jackhammer inside his chest . " Still , you know , these Catholic marriages have to be consummated , or they do n't count . " Karen pushed him away playfully . " I think we 're expected to go and greet our guests , William , dear . " " We have to do that , huh ? " " It 's traditional , " said Karen , with mock aloofness . " Then let 's get her done , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arm. 5 April 1967 USS Valley Forge , in port , Long Beach , California " Come on , man ! " Mendoza 's voice had taken on a wheedling tone . " This is a great opportunity ! " Moser wiped the gun oil from his hands on a big red rag , then stuffed it back into his pocket . He replaced the M-1 in its rack , cleaned and greased , and picked up the next one . These old guns sure do rust up , if you do n't stay on them , he thought . " Juan , I tole you , I tolep287you in the Philippines , an ' I 'm tellin ' you here , I don ' want nothin ' to do with no drugs . " Mendoza hopped off the stool , and spun around in frustration . " It ai n't real drugs , Moser , just marijuana ! Grass ! The guys all smoke a little , even some of the officers ! " Moser sprung the bolt out of the second M-1 and dropped it in the bath of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it aside , then took the gas-pressure tube off the barrel , and dropped both in the bath . " You do as you like , Juan ; jest leave me out of it . " " Hey , Moser ! There 's money , big money , to be made . You 're my buddy , and the armory locker is the perfect place to store it , since you got the only key . " The armory is nice , but what I really need the big dummy for is muscle if anybody tries to move in on the traffic . " So I 'm doing you a favor , letting you in as a partner . " For ten percent , that is , but he do n't need to know that . " Lieutenant Stuart has a key , Juan ; so 's the chief , " said Moser , slowly running a wire brush through the barrel of the rifle in front of him . " Yeah , but those dickheads never look in the lockers , man ; you 're the only one . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , thought Moser . " No , Juan , no dope in my armory . Ferget it . " " OK , OK , we 'll find some other place . Look , just come in with me , help me handle the , ah , buying and selling . " " How come you need me fer that ? " " Well , look , Moser , OK , you 're a big man . Everybody , well , knows you can handle yourself in a fight . " " I don ' wan na fight nobody . " " Hey , I know , but with you in , nobody will fuck with me . With us . And look , man , don ' you wan na make some cash ? What with sendin ' money off to your mother , and to that courthouse , you ca n't even buy a beer most nights . " " I manage . " " Yeah , sure , you think I do n't know ? This is n't like bein ' at sea , man . You can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are stateside prices . It takes money . " Juan backed off to let that sink in . Moser replaced the wire brush on the cleaning rod with a slotted tip , threaded in a patch , and swabbed out the bore of the M-1 . He was broke , and Juan knew it . Everybody knew it . Guys laughed at himp288because he had no civvies , and the chief was on him to buy some decent uniforms . He did n't do anything expensive , but Juan was right , a guy had a lot more ways to spend money in Long Beach than at sea . He would be OK , but he was still paying off the front window of the store back home , and the windshield of the police car . And his mother had written she was feeling poorly , so Moser had made a small allotment of his pay out to her , too . " It 's easy money , Moser . You don ' even have to touch the stuff if you do n't want to . " Moser held up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the light on the overhead . The old barrel was pitted , but no amount of swabbing was going to change that . Better let it soak some more , he thought , dropping it back into the cleaning bath . " Bet ' at ole gun kilt Japs , or Germans , in War Two , Juan . " " Yeah , sure . Look , man , I need you on this . You 're the only one I trust to watch my back . " I do n't need money that bad , decided Moser . The decision felt right , now that it was made . " No , Juan , I ai n't gon na be involved in no drug dealin ' , no way . " Mendoza stormed out of the armory without another word , seething with anger . That 's what you think , asshole . Lieutenant and Mrs. Stuart fell easily into the routine of married life in the apartment Karen had rented in Long Beach . William liked the feel of " Lieutenant and Mrs. Stuart , " and used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had continued success in selling the BankAmericard to merchants , and she bubbled with energy . Most evenings she cooked their dinner , full of enthusiasm from the results of her day . When her days went less well , William barbecued , or they went out . William 's own work on the ship was increasingly boring ; the division had off-loaded all its ammunition in a short visit to Seal Beach , and the long yard period had begun , which meant the guns were being retrofitted , and that William had to write endless reports . The hardest times for both of them were the nights , every fourth night , when William had to stay on board the Valley , as part of the duty section . " I 'm sorry you 're bored on the ship , darling , but after all you 've been through , it must be a relief . " William had said nothing about the run up the Cua Viet River , convinced that Karen would worry without need . Ile had given a sparsep289account of the helicopter crash , only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been awarded , and made light of the decorations themselves . Even so , Karen had seemed frightened , and they had not spoken of the matter since . " I 'm just glad to be here , my love . Being with you almost every evening of my life makes all boring aspects of this man 's Navy easily tolerated . " Karen flew into his arms , upsetting his drink . " Oh , my love , you really will never leave me again . Say it , please ! " Stuart held her close , tight . " I ca n't see how , love . By the time the Valley finishes her yard and the fleet refresher training , I 'll be too short to deploy . " Just let me train the boots , then off the ship before she heads west again , he prayed . I never want to be apart from my love again . Karen nuzzled his neck . " Then champagne , my love , and then do the steaks . Gordy Mason and his boring Nebraska wife will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was n't at our wedding . " So was Gordy , thought William , with an inward smirk . He gently lifted his wife aside , and went out to the patio to light the charcoal grill . Moser lay in his bunk , thinking . Mendoza had been strutting around the G Division berthing space , resplendent in his third new set of dress whites , waiting for liberty call . He had a new watch , and even a gold chain around his neck , long enough to be concealed beneath the collar and kerchief of his blouse . Mendoza had been bragging about his vast success with the chicks , as usual . Moser did n't care about Juan 's bragging ; bragging came as natural to Juan as breathing , but Moser felt every day his own poverty , and the temptation to get into the easy money Mendoza was making supplying marijuana to the guys . Yet he still resisted . Maybe if I can make second class , I can get out of this hole , he thought . " Goin ' ashore , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nah . I think I 'll jest stay aboard , maybe watch the movie . " Mendoza smiled , " Hey , look , man , come on over to the Blue Girl . I 'm buyin ' . " What the hell , thought Moser . I could use a beer . " Thanks , Juan , I will . " Mendoza reached down and slapped the big man 's shoulder . " Way to be , man , let 's go . " Moser returned to the ship after accepting two beers from Mendoza ,  |p290along  with a pitch from Juan once again to get into the dope business . Moser 's head hurt from the conflict within ; it was n't easy to be without money while the ship lay in dry dock , but he still refused Mendoza 's entreaties to join in the dealing . He was beginning to wonder why he struggled against sin . Hell , nobody really cared about grass . Mendoza continued cruising , pleased with himself . Moser would be in his pocket before too much longer . How the hump @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought idly . The business was going well , but Mendoza knew he would feel a lot better with Moser along for backup . Moser was big backup . Mendoza strolled from bar to bar , always being the big man , standing drinks , sometimes making appointments to score dope for some Valley sailor . He was careful ; he sold to no one he did n't know , unless the new person was introduced and vouched for by someone he did know . As Mendoza sometimes sold on credit , his clients were eager to find new buyers ; Mendoza gave back a little on the debt for each new pigeon . It was so easy . Mendoza tired of the bar scene around 2300 , and took a cab back to the base . As he walked through the gate , two petty officers fell into step with him , one on either side . Both wore shore patrol arm bands . " Mendoza , Juan E. ? " said the first class on his right , taking Mendoza 's arm . Mendoza shook his arm free , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man ? " The first class took his arm again , more firmly , and the third class on his other side did likewise . " Step over here , to the gatehouse , Mendoza . A little talk . " Mendoza was hustled inside , his knees going to water . The civilian security guards who should have been in the gatehouse were nowhere in evidence . The third class pushed Mendoza down into a hard chair , and stood behind him . The first class sat on the desk , looking down at Mendoza , with his nightstick across his knees . Mendoza fought to hold his voice steady , " Hey , man , I mean , what the fuck  --  " " Stow it , asshole , " said the first class , quietly . " We want to talk to you about dope . " " Hey , man ! I ai n't got no dope ! Search me ! " The first class smiled , tapping the nightstick rhythmically against his palm . " No need . We ai n't concerned with what you might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about business , then . " So what , then ? " The first class hitched himself higher on the desk . " You dealin ' dope on the Valley , Juan E. , and we on the master-at-arms . " The first class paused , and Mendoza said nothing . " The Valley , and its good order and discipline , are my responsibility . " Mendoza could n't suppress a smirk . Amateurs , he thought . " I don ' know what you sayin ' , man . " " Of course not , Juan E. But we figure an operation as large as yours , " the first class reached down and ripped the gold chain from Mendoza 's neck , " needs protection . " Mendoza felt himself flush with anger . The chain disappeared into the first class 's pocket . " You don ' know , man , " Mendoza hissed . " I ai n't in this alone ! " " So what ? " asked the first class , real quick . " So , man , you fuck with me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughed , loudly . Behind him , Mendoza heard the third class ho-hoing as well . The first class tapped his nightstick on Mendoza 's shoulder hard enough to make him wince . " You Messican cocksucker , you ai n't got nothing wit ' which to kick no ass ! You meat to me , anytime ! " he finished with a final bark of laughter . " Sure , man , " said Mendoza , pushing the nightstick away with more confidence than he felt , " you got you , and I got Moser . " The first class put the butt of the nightstick in the center of Mendoza 's forehead and pushed . Juan twisted away . " Word we have is Moser is nowhere near this thing of yours , Juan E. " " That 's because he ai n't been needed before now , man . " The first class was thinking about that . Mendoza watched his mind grinding through low gear . The quiet lasted a full two minutes . Juan rose from the chair . Neither man stopped him , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Juan E. , " said the first class , softly , but with an edge of meanness in his voice . " It seems to me you might still need some supplemental protection . " Mendoza snickered , " More'n Moser ? I do n't think so . " " Yeah , well , maybe he 's in , maybe not . My offer is twenny percent , full cover on Valley , and cooperation on other ships in Long Beach . " Mendoza stood in the doorway , feeling in complete control . " And just how much you reckon twenty percent is , cowboy ? " The first class smiled , slowly , " About three hundred dollars a month , more or less . " " Shit , man , that 's more like sixty percent , " said Mendoza , smilingp292back . Actually , he knew that the figure was almost exactly twenty percent , and he wondered how the master-at-arms had figured it out . " Anyways , we can talk about details  --  " the first class offered . " Anyways , fuck you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gatehouseand strode back toward the ship , his balls clanking . His rush of triumph faded as he climbed the after-brow onto the ship . Now I really better get the big guy , he thought . William joined the going-away party for Buck Thomas at the Long Beach Officers ' Club , which was already in full swing . Buck had received his orders to return to Nam as the officer in charge  --  the skipper , really  --  of a PCF ; or swift boat . He was scheduled to leave for San Diego in the morning for training on the boats , then off to the patrol squadron based in Vung Tau , at the mouth of the Saigon River . Most of the ship 's junior officers and quite a few seniors were gathered in a knot at the end of the bar , drinking at happy hour prices . The men were boisterous , and Buck Thomas was enjoying the attention . " Congratulations , Buck ! I know you wanted this , " said Stuart , raising his beer glass to his friend . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away from this filthy , boring shipyard ! Did you hear , Gordy is leaving too ! " " No ! Where are you going , Gordy ? " " Pensacola ! Flight School , William , gon na fly the jet . Just got my orders today ! " William was nonplussed . " Did n't you have to extend to get that ? " " Yeah , two years , but what the hell ; I 'm probably going to stay in , anyway . " Jesus , I 'm going to be the only one left if this keeps up , thought William , as he half listened to Buck talking about doing river patrols in the forty-foot swift boats , taking the war to the enemy with the boat 's twin fifty-caliber machine guns and other weapons . Buck was really excited and he made it sound like an enormous lark . Good for Buck , thought William . Of course , he does n't have a wife to consider . Imagine Gordy , though , adding two years to his commitment , and going avia-tion ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not come and join me ? With your jacket , you could get a boat , easy ! " Buck slapped him on the shoulder . " Gee , maybe I would , Buck , if I did n't think my wife would cut my balls off if I asked for orders . " ' ( ' here was a chorus of jeers , andp293laughter . " Besides , staying here and getting short is a dirty job , but somebody has to do it . " Stuart refilled his beer glass and forced himself to join the fun of the party. 21 April 1967The XO stopped Stuart as he was leaving the wardroom after breakfast . " A word , William . " " Yes , sir . " " My cabin , ten minutes . " " Yes , sir . " I wonder what that 's about , thought Stuart . He walked up to the hangar deck , and took the morning report from the Chief and the division . All present or accounted for , sir . Fine , mused Stuart . Every day the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who managed insolence even when standing at attention . Stuart looked at Mendoza 's dungarees , tailored like all his uniforms , skintight to the thighs , flaring widely to the bell bottoms . " Chief ? " " Yessir . " " Get Mendoza into a proper working uniform of the United States Navy . " " Yessir . " The Chief allowed himself a half smile . Mendoza 's eyes smoldered with hatred , and a few snickers could be heard from the men . Stuart turned away from the men , and spoke to the Chief alone . " I want that man out of this division , Chief Everson . " " Workin ' on it , sir , " said the Chief , barely moving his lips . " Without him , we got a good division . " " Right , Chief . " Stuart strode from the hangar deck to the XO 's stateroom . The door to the XO 's stateroom was closed , so Stuart knocked and waited . After perhaps thirty seconds , Commander Simon barked " enter , " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time he had been into the executive officer 's quarters since the day some eleven months before when he had received his assignment to G Division . It seemed a very long time ago . " Commander ? " The XO smiled his tiny smile . " Sit , William . This will be brief . The Captain wants to see you in his cabin , at ten-hundred hours , ex-actly . " William felt a jolt of electricity . The Captain rarely bothered with junior officers . " May I ask what the Captain wants , Commander ? "  |p294The  commander arched his brows , indicating the question was inappropriate . " The Captain will enlighten you , at ten-hundred , William . " " Yes , sir . Sorry , sir . " The XO granted Stuart a wintry smile . " Until ten , then William ? Close the door as you leave , please . " That man hates the entire world , thought William , closing the door behind himself . A shiver ran down his spine . Mendoza caught Moser putting his shaving gear into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he was n't going ashore . Even freshly shaven , his big cheeks were blue . " Hey , Moser , goin ' ashore tonight ? " Mendoza makes it sound like a taunt , thought Moser ; he knows I 'm broker than ever . " No , Juan , I 'm takin ' duty fer Harada . His girlfrin ' is sick . " " Sick , my ass , she 's preg . Bet he paid you five bucks to take his duty , " smirked Mendoza . Ten , actually , thought Moser , bleakly . " I got ta get to the armory , Juan . " " I 'm still keeping a place for you in the deal , man . " Moser sighed . I sure could use it . " No , Juan , but thanks . " " Hey , man , I understand . I 'll be here , if you change your mind . " " Thanks , Juan . " Mendoza started to walk away , then came back . " Hey , man , my momma sent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got no room in my locker . Could you keep it for me ? " Moser took the box and put it in the bottom of his nearly empty locker . " No sweat , man . Jest tell me when you want it . " " Thanks , man . Catch you later . " " Yeah . Hey , take care , Juan . " Mendoza walked to the ladder that would carry him to the hangar deck , then to mount 52 , grinning broadly . You in the drug business now , asshole buddy of mine . Stuart busied himself with yet another sitrep , a report on the status of the after-port-side mount , called mount 58 . The old gun continued to have more problems than all of the others put together , but Stuart felt a certain affection for it . When he had first become assistant division officer of G Division , mount 58 had been his general quarters station . She was now Gunner 's Mate Third ( ' lass Gretz 's mount , and he andp295his crew labored to keep her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every crack and seam for twenty years , and the gun got worse despite the effort . Nonetheless , when the Valley had taken her practice fire at the towed target sled off Okinawa , fifty-eight alone had direct hits under visual spot . Stuart looked at his watch continuously as he labored over the boring report form , until finally it was 0950 . He locked away the file , climbed out of the division office , and made his way to the Captain 's in-port cabin . Stuart was admitted by a uniformed Filipino steward , who gave him coffee from a silver pot , and withdrew . The in-port cabin was like a house , or at least a big apartment , suspended below the flight deck . The living room , Stuart could n't think of any other words to describe it , was twenty feet by thirty , and furnished with leather chairs and sofas , a rich deep blue carpet , and oil paintings of naval battles on the bulkheads . Stuart had been in the room only once before , the day a month @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grade , and the Captain and the Commander had snapped into place his new shoulder boards with a stripe and a half . Seated on a leather sofa , peering at a painting of the USS Wasp , a revolutionary war sloop of war engaging the HMS Frolic , Stuart wondered what the rest of the in-port cabin contained , though he never expected to see it . A door opened in the bulkhead to Stuart 's right , and the Captain walked in , followed by the XO . Stuart rose to attention , and was invited to sit down . The Captain was carrying a thin folder , which he placed on the coffee table in front of Stuart . The Captain congratulated Stuart on his marriage and repeated his apologies at being unable to attend , then got down to business . " William , I 'm sure you know this old warrior lady will be in dry dock for some months , and I know you 're bored at the prospect . " " I 'll see her through and back to sea , Captain . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thank you , William , that 's the right thing to say . But luckily for you , you will not . " The Captain tapped the folder on the table in front of him . " This folder contains new orders for you , William . You 're to be spared the drudgery of the rest of the yard period . " William swallowed , half elated , half panicked . " Orders , sir ? " he croaked . " Yes , " smiled the Captain . " You are to report to the Naval DemolitionTraining School at San Diego , then a quicky course in battlefieldp296casualty management  --  read first aid  --  then to the Seventh Air and Naval Liaison Company  --  Seventh ANGLICO  --  in Danang . " Stuart felt as though he had been kicked in the solar plexus . He was totally breathless , and had to wait until he could get some air before he replied . " Whe-when does this happen , sir ? " " The first of the schools begins in three weeks . " Stuart sat silent . Karen is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a great opportunity , William . This assignment will launch your career . " The Captain seemed hurt that Stuart was n't jumping for joy . Stuart regained his composure . Of course it would , he thought , and I really do n't want to spend six months in the yard . " Captain , I just got married , " he blurted . " I know , and the little lady may not love the idea that her officer is going back overseas so soon , but it really will be good for you . For both of you . " " Yes , sir , but I 'm a reserve . I just  --  I know it 's an honor , sir , but I had kind of wanted to spend some time with my wife . " I should n't be saying this , he thought , but Karen  --  . The Captain took off his reading glasses , and dropped them on top of the orders . He suddenly looked tired . " William , you are a serving officer in the United States Navy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weapons officer , and from me . Please do n't embarrassus . " " No , sir , " said William , quickly . " It 's a volunteer assignment , six months only . You know we want you to consider staying in the Navy . We know you like the Navy more than you admit . " " Yes , sir . " William knew he did like the Navy , and he felt small for putting his own preference before his duty . " I understand , Captain . " " My wife , and the other Valley wives , will look after Karen . In six months , you will have a jacket the envy of any jaygee in the Navy . If you want to get out , fine . If you want to stay in , go regular Navy ; you will be well placed . " Stuart felt miserable . He wanted to please the Captain , and he realized he wanted to go back to Nam , where it was happening . But he loved his wife , and his marriage , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sir . Thank you , sir . " " Talk to your wife , then come and see me tomorrow , William . " " Yes , sir . Sir , I 'm proud to he selected for an ANGLICO . " Stuartp297was only vaguely aware of what an ANGLICO did , but he had heard it was both elite and highly visible . " Talk to your wife , William , and decide . It 's a volunteer assign-ment . " " Yes , sir , I will . What time should I report to you tomorrow , sir ? " " Ten-hundred would be fine , William . " " Yes , sir . " And I have seven hours to figure out what to say to Karen , he thought , as he walked from the Captain 's cabin in a daze . " Goddammit , William , why in the fuck does it have to be you ? " William was shocked by the tone and vehemence of Karen 's outburst . He had never heard such harsh language from her , or ever expected to . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the room from one side to the other . " How can you just sit there , damn you ? Why you ? " " Karen  --  " William felt his voice weak , pleading . " Just tell me , William ! You went to Vietnam ! You were wounded ! You even brought back a fucking medal ! Have n't you had enough ? Have n't they had enough ? " " Karen , it 's a six months tour , and that 's it , stateside shore duty until I get out  --  " " Damn you ! You were missing from my life , except for a week in Manhattan Beach , from February of last year to January of this year ! Another six months is OK with you ? " " Karen , I 'm a naval officer . I have to go where they tell me ; you know that . " William tried to embrace his wife , but she shook herself free and walked away from him . He felt a deep hurt , mixed with anger . Karen turned to look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She was almost ugly . Suddenly she burst into tears , and ran to him , throwing her arms around him and sobbing like a widow at a graveside . William closed his eyes as he held her , holding back his own tears . He had to go , he knew , even though the Captain had left open the door by saying it was a volunteer assignment . William knew for certain that his navy career would be ruined if he went back and said he would n't go . He also knew he had to go for something inside himself . No man need seek danger , William 's ancestor had written during the Civil War , but none could run from it once it was at hand . Danger in war was an honor unto itself . Yet is that a selfish position ? he asked himself , as Karen keenedp298softly in his arms , and he rocked her gently . Hell , the truth is , I want to go back , at least to get close to the fight . But do I have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the armed service ahead of Karen 's happiness ? He knew what the Captain would say , or Bill Donald , or even Hoop . Other women have made greater sacrifices . I 'm just being sent to some headquarters type of job for six months ; Karen will be all right . He nuzzled her hair and she raised her face , red from crying and wrinkled from pressing into his shirt . She kissed him , hard , deeply , then pushed him backward , into the tiny bedroom and onto the bed . Their lovemaking was urgent , almost violent , as Karen took complete control . She seemed to be able to go places in her passion where he could not follow , though she tried to draw him after her into the scary night where passion became total abandon . She thrashed wildly , giving voice to harsh cries that could mean pleasure or pain or savage anger . She pressed him onto his back and rode his penis mercilessly , painfully , as if to break it . He winced as her nails pulled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was enchanted , and he was afraid . Finally she came with a shudder , and a long , low cry , and collapsed on his chest . They were soaked with sweat . William felt his penis soften while still inside her , though he had not come . Karen rolled off him , and lay quietly , looking at him . He looked at her , and then at the ceiling , then back at her . " I love you , Karen . " She did n't reply , but turned her face to the pillow , and began to cry again , softly . William got up and went into the shower . " William , did you know about these orders back to Vietnam before we were married ? " The question had come across the small room like a missile , and William had almost ducked . They had prepared and eaten dinner in virtual silence , then washed the dishes , and now they sat across the room from each other , staring at the flickering image on Karen 's tiny black and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love . I only found out today . " " Would you have still wanted to get married if you had known ? " " Of course , " he paused , but Karen sat silent . " Would n't you have ? " Karen looked at William across the room . She seemed to be faraway . " Why would you want to marry me , and then go back to Vietnam ? Marriage means together , it means sharing , and loving . I love you , your bright spirit , William , but I also need what your body gives me.  |p299Sometimes  I think I 'm only truly me when I 'm loving you . While you were gone , I was n't really sure who I was , Karen the bank trainee , Karen of Long Beach and the Bank of America , but not Karen the woman . Since you 've been back , all those Karens have become one again , William , and I 've been so happy  --  " the word came out like a sob "  --  and now you want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crossed the room , and sat beside his wife , hugging her as she began to cry , rubbing her eyes with her knuckles like a little girl . There was a lump in his throat , and William felt overwhelmedwith the enormity of his love for her . For a moment he just held her , awkwardly , as she sat stiffly . He wanted to do anything that would make it right for her . " Karen , the last thing , the very last thing I want on this earth is to be separated from you , ever . But suppose , just suppose , I were to go to the Navy , and say I 've done enough for you , for the country , and now I just want to stay home . What would you think of me , as a man ? " " I would still love you , and I would still have you . " " I 'd never feel worthy of you , ever again , if I did that . " " But why ? What do you care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? You already have a goddamn medal . " " Karen , there 's a war on . The armed forces have to fight when called . Men have to go when called . " " Oh , William ! Do n't you read the newspapers ? Do n't you watch television ? Nobody wants this war , nobody ! Every day , people protest , march , demonstrate ! " " Students , perhaps afraid to go themselves  --  " " William ! Students , and grandmothers , and everyone ! People either oppose the war , or simply do n't care ! " Karen bent forward , pressing her face to her knees , and put her hands over her ears . William sat silently , his arms folded across his chest . His breathing was rapid and shallow , as his mind raced from the adrenaline of fear and anger and confusion . " Karen , I care about the war . Men I work with , men I respect care about winning the war , and ending it , and coming home . But we have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ backs . " " Why , why do you have to care ? " said Karen to her knees . William fought the fear , and the anger , and the overriding confusion . Ile had never really tried to analyze the war . He just went , becausedammit , because the country had called . " Maybe I do it for you . Forp300us , Karen . To be your man , I have to be a man , to myself . That is n't medieval . " Karen dropped her hands , and looked at him , suddenly dry-eyed . It was a look of pure contempt . She shook off his arm and stood up . " You wo n't be satisfied until you come home in a goddamned box . " She turned and strode into the bedroom , and slammed the door . William sat in the G Division office , drinking coffee and smoking . He could n't decide which tasted worse , the coffee or the cigarettes . His head pounded as he thought about the awful fight with Karen and what it might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bedroom and closed the door , he sat quietly for a while , drinking Scotch and smoking , staring at the television set with no idea what he was watching . After an hour , he got up , shut off the TV , and brushed his teeth . When he went to the bedroom , he found the door was locked . He had knocked gently , then more loudly . Karen had called through the doorway for him to go away . He pleaded , but she did n't answer . He went into the kitchen and got the whiskey bottle , and quietly finished it , along with another ten cigarettes . He found himself weeping with frustration and rage , so he brushed his teeth again , and pounded on the bedroom door , demanding to be let in . Karen had shouted hateful things at him , suggesting , among other things , that since he loved the Navy more than his wife , he could go sleep on his ship . William would have done that , he was angry enough , but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or be seen on the ship . Finally , he gave up , and slept on the old , too-short couch in the living room , in his clothes . It was no wonder he felt awful . Karen and he had both apologized in the morning , but her manner had been distant . She announced that her Aunt Liz had invited them down to Balboa for the weekend , and she hoped they could drive down after she got home from work . " Ah , Karen , I have the duty on Saturday . I 'll drive down Sunday , early . " Karen had smiled sweetly and said that would be fine . She would , therefore , go directly from work . It meant he would sleep alone for the next two nights at least , he thought bleakly . Stuart crushed out the cigarette . He could not be in a worse humor , and he hoped nothing else would happen today . He heard the clatter as a sailor came down the ladder into the division office , and winced asp301the sound reverberated inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new replacements . " Sir , " began Simmons , breathlessly , " the chief sent me . He wants you to come to the ammo handling room under mount 53 , right away , sir . " Stuart closed his eyes , then opened them , slowly . His silent wish had not been granted , and Simmons was still there . " What 's the trouble , Simmons ? " " He just said to get you , sir ; said he had to wait right there . " Stuart pushed himself out of the chair and stood . He was dizzy , and he wanted to throw up the greasy breakfast he had eaten . Pull yourself together , man , he thought . He picked up his cap , and followed Simmons through ladders and passageways up to the flight deck , then to mount 53 , just forward of the bridge , and down into the ammunition handling room directly below the mount . In the dim light of the handling room , Stuart could see the chief standing over a scared-looking Juan Mendoza . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stuart , an ' I think I foun ' his stash . " Stuart pressed his fingers to his throbbing temples as nausea and rage fought for control . Mendoza felt cornered , trapped between the bulk of the chief and the ammunition hoist inside which he had stashed a shoebox full of cleaned , cured grass , the twin of the one in Moser 's locker . He had figured no one would be going in and out of the ammo handling space since the ship had off-loaded all of her ammo in Seal Beach weeks before . Harada was supposed to clean the space , but Mendoza was sure he never opened the hoist itself , and besides , Harada was smart enough to be afraid of Mendoza . Everything would have been fine if I had n't come in here for a quick toke to make the morning go , thought Mendoza . The fucking chief must have been following me around , because no sooner did I get it rolled and lit up , the fucking hump came charging in and clouted me . My fucking head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was a big man , and he was quick with his fists when no officer was looking . Mendoza had never been able to con the chief , or to buy him off . For this reason , he was glad to see the division officer step into the ammo handling room , and to see his expression of disgust . This is a man who can he had , thoughtp302Mendoza , though Stuart had proved less of a patsy than most of these college-boy assholes . Nevertheless , at least his being here will keep the chief from doing a tap dance on my skull . Stuart finished rubbing his eyes , pushing the rage back deep in his brain . His mouth was dry , and he still wanted to throw up . Make yourself think , William , he thought . This is a serious problem , but if we handle it just right , old Mendoza is gonzo . " Where is the marijuana cigarette , chief ? " " There , sir . " The chief pointed to a stamped-out butt on the steel deck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notebook from his shirt pocket , tore out a clean page , and knelt and swept the butt and the surrounding ashes onto the paper . He lifted the paper carefully , and set it on the flat surface of the ready ammo box near the hatch . " That 's evidence , chief . You 'll have to write down where you first saw it , and how you observed it continuously until I took control of it . " " I know , sir , I bin there . " " Good . " Stuart stood up , and his head reeled . " So , where 's the stash ? " " In the hoist , sir . " The chief twisted open the bronze dogs , then lifted the lid . Stuart could see a shoebox . " You look inside ? " " No , sir , " said the chief with a grin . " Figured I 'd best wait for you . " " Good , we 'll get the master-at-arms to remove it , presently . " Mendoza snorted . It was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ space . " This is funny , Mendoza ? " asked Stuart . " I was just thinkin ' , sir , if that shoebox is what you think it is , you give it to the M-As , they just gon na steal it . " Mendoza was working up his courage , getting some defiance into his voice . " Do you have anything else to say , Mendoza ? " " Yes , sir ! Only that this is a crock . I 'm in here , so maybe havin ' a smoke , whatever , and the fuckin '  --  sorry sir  --  the chief , sir , comes Bustin ' in , and belts me , an ' then he , you know , finds this box he says is Jane . I don ' know what is in that box . " " This is n't your property ? " " Hell , no , sir ! "  | " Then whose do you suppose it is ? " Mendoza smiled . Dumb fucking officer , always trying to be fair . " Maybe the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The chief started forward , his big fists balled . A gesture from the Lieutenant stopped him . William felt his hangover and his frustration drain away , like the water after a cold shower . The bright , ice-hard sharpness of anger swept over his mind , and he looked at Mendoza . What manner of creature is this ? He tears at the very fabric of discipline , of honor , of duty . " So you , Mendoza , say that you 're innocent , no persecuted , in this matter ? " Mendoza could n't decipher the taut expression on the Lieutenant 's face , and that cost him some of his confidence . " Well , yeah , uh , yes , sir . You know the chief always has it in for me . " Stuart heard a growl from the chief , behind him , and again held up his hand . " And , Mendoza , what will you say if we can prove , prove that this box is yours ? " Stuart pointed at the open hoist , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his eyes , and Mendoza did . " There will be fingerprints all over it , and the chief has told us he did n't touch it . " Stuart knew that the chances of lifting a readable print from a cardboard box were minimal , but he doubted Mendozawould know that . Mendoza 's anger , like that of a cornered rat , overcame his fear . " You still could do nothing , Mister Stuart , because maybe the box belongs to your war-hero buddy , Moser ! " Stuart was taken aback , but fought not to show it . So the little weasel has baited a trap . " Sir , " growled the chief , on the edge of losing control , " maybe I asked you to come up here , ah , prematurely . Let me talk to Men-doza  --  " " He already whupped me once . I got rights  --  " " Shut UP ! " bellowed Stuart . He paused , forcing a veneer of calm over his anger . He spoke softly . " Mendoza , you 've made accusations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say these things , for the record ? " Mendoza felt good . Fuck you , asshole , he thought , as he worked his face into an insolent smile . " I do n't know nothin ' sir ; I 'm just tired of bein ' dumped on for nothin ' . " Stuart turned , slowly , and confronted the chief . " Chief , I want you to go down to the armory , and ask , ask Moser for his permission top304search his locker . If he refuses , confiscate his locker key , and report to me in the division office . If he agrees , and if you find anything he ca n't explain , lock his locker , and wait for me . Clear ? " " Yes , sir , " said the chief , visibly angry . " What about Mendoza ? " Stuart tried to make his face blank . " Chief , Mendoza has made serious allegations , which must be heard . " The chief shifted his bulk . His face was knotted with rage . " Sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken by a chief in this man 's Navy ! " Stuart smiled . Only the chief could see the smile . " I understand , chief , but given the extent of Mendoza 's allegations , I think it better if I talk to him . " The chief caught Stuart 's expression , and allowed his face to relax . " I understand , sir ; I 'm sure you 'll handle it best . " He turned and left the handling room . Mendoza calmed himself . Now I have the asshole officer to myself , he thought . Let him make the first move . Stuart propped his left foot against the hoist , and pulled up his sock . What kind of a pussy wears long socks , thought Mendoza , gaining confidence . " So , Juan , what do we really have here ? Surely you do n't think the chief and your friend Moser are setting you up ? " " I do n't have nothin ' more to say , sir . " Stuart gestured casually toward the joint , resting on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You were smoking a joint , at the very least . " Mendoza moved cat quick , and swept the joint off the ready box onto the deck , then scattered it with his boot . " What fucking evidence , sir ? You got not shit , an ' if you get me , your pal Moser goes down , and maybe the chief ! " Stuart moved forward and struck Mendoza on the ear with an open hand . The force of the blow sent Mendoza skidding on his ass across the deck and into the bulkhead . Mendoza sat silently and smiled , then rubbed the ear . " You ca n't do that , man . They court-martial you for hitting me . " " Why , Mendoza ? What happened ? " Stuart smiled , but his eyes were ugly . Mendoza began to feel afraid . Better deal , he thought , getting slowly to his feet . " OK , Mister Stuart , 1  --  " The second blow rang his head , and he slipped to his knees . " Hey , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't hit hack ! "  |p305Stuart  circled , watching the downed man . He unbuttoned his shirt , and tossed it toward the bulkhead , then tossed his cap after it . " Officer , Juan ? I do n't have any insignia , and lots of civilian yardbirds wear khaki pants , just like these . There is n't a lot of light in here ; I could be anyone . " Definitely crazy , thought Mendoza . " You sayin ' I should hit you back ? " Stuart stood , casual , relaxed . The indifference of the pose infuriated Mendoza . " You make accusations against your friends  --  my friends , too , Juan . Surely you 're not afraid to back them up ? " Mendoza shifted himself , ready to spring . Stuart just stood there . Mendoza spoke , very softly , " Esta bien , culo , " then he rushed . In one motion , Stuart slipped off his shoe , and kicked Mendoza 's flying body in the solar plexus . Mendoza 's lungs emptied in a pained gasp , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his back . Stuart stood smilingfaintly as Mendoza caught his breath . It took a long time . Mendozagasped , " You fucker , you 'll never get away with this ! I 'll just sho-show these bruises to the Captain , and you 'll be permanently fucked  --  " Stuart 's second kick caught Mendoza in the throat , choking off the sound . Mendoza 's harsh breathing had a sickening clicking sound . Stuart kicked again , striking under the last rib , and Mendoza curled into a ball and began to whimper . " There wo n't be any bruises , Juan , other than those you might have gotten from a fall down a ladder . " Stuart paused as Mendoza continued to gasp and whimper . " But then , if you did show marks from a fight , who would know who did it ? You have a lot of enemies . " Stuart slowly raised his leg in the crane posture . Mendoza cringed back into the corner between the deck and the bulkhead . " OK , what do you want ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stuart lowered the threatening leg . " Do you wish to reconsider your story about whose box of dope this is in the hoist ? " Mendoza battled his terror , but could not overcome it . " It 's mine , " he rasped . " And the stash we 're sure to find in Moser 's locker ? " " Mine , " said Mendoza , miserably . " And the chief . Do you still wish to say he was involved ? " " No . " Mendoza rolled to a kneeling position , holding his battered ribs.  |p306Stuart  knelt on the deck in front of Mendoza . " And , Juan , you will remember your story , when you go before the Captain ? " His face was inches from Mendoza 's , and he could smell the other man 's fear . " Yes . Yes , sir , " Mendoza blubbered . Stuart struck Mendoza sharply on his other ear with an open hand , and Mendoza cried out . " And , Juan , you are n't going to suggest , even on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ college-boy officer , are you ? " " No , sir , just stop ; you 're killing me . " Stuart sat back on his haunches , smiling his awful smile . " Hardly , Juan . Are we agreed the lesson has been learned ? " " Yes , sir . " Oh , God , get me out of here , thought Mendoza . Stuart jumped up , and kicked Mendoza again , in precisely the same spot as the previous kick under the ribs . Mendoza screamed . " We 'll just reinforce the lesson , Juan . " Stuart kicked him again , in the same spot , and Mendoza wailed and crawled behind the hoist . " Wait here , Mendoza , for the chief , or the master-at-arms . Do you understand ? " " Yes , sir , " sobbed Mendoza . " Understand everything ? " " Yes , sir ! " Stuart stood , and retrieved his shoe , then his shirt and cap , and put them on . " So be it . "  |p307Stuart  walked into the ship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a .50-caliber machine gun . " You wanted to see me , Moser ? " " Urn , yessir . " The big man looked up , then continued prying the delicate return spring from the mechanism . Stuart marveled at the deftness of Moser 's blunt fingers , and at his concentration on the work , but he felt antsy , and wanted to take care of Moser 's problem , and get on with his own . " The chief said you wanted to see me privately , and in here . What is it we could n't deal with in the division office ? " Stuart winced at the irritation in his voice , but could n't think of a reason to be cross with Moser . " Uh , yes , sir . I jes ' thought we 'd be better off in private . I wo n't keep you long . " Stuart felt his irritation rising again . He had gotten used to Moser 's slow speech , but just now he wished the big man would come to the point . Moser was filing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , something that looked like a cam . His absorption in the task was complete , and Stuart felt Moser had completely forgotten his presence . " Moser , please , what is it you wanted to say ? " Moser gave the cam one final careful stroke with the jeweler 's file , then took the part from the vice and dropped it hack into the solventp308bath . " There she be . Well , Mister Stuart , I 'm real concerned about Juan . " Fucking Mendoza , thought Stuart , always trouble , and always draggingMoser into his schemes . Well , no more . " What about Mendoza , Moser ? " " Well , you know , sir , he was my frind , all the way from San Diego . " The irritation flickered low in Stuart 's brain . " Moser , it 's not my business to pick your friends , but you have to know that Mendoza took advantage of your friendship many times . " Including setting you up to take his drug bust , thought Stuart , though it will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know . Juan thought I was dumb , an ' maybe I am . " Moser looked sad , even sorry . " Well , you 're a third class gunner 's mate in a good division , and Mendoza is busted back to seaman recruit and on his way to the brig in San Diego to do two years hard time , so who looks dumb now ? " " Oh , I know , sir . I know Juan got me into trouble , fightin ' and all . And I figured he tried to set me up with his dope stash in my locker . " There 's hope for you yet , thought Stuart . " Then why do you still think of him as your friend ? " Moser turned from the work in front of him and looked fully at Stuart . His rugged face held a look of puzzlement , even sorrow . " I ai n't got no frinds , sir . At least Juan , he needed me . " Stuart eased himself into the stool next to Moser 's workbench @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all the paperwork he had to get through before he turned over the division in four days . Relax , he told himself . It 's your job , and besides , you owe it to the kid to talk to him ; he really has no one else . " I almos ' wish I could go with him . " " Moser , Juan was a fuck-up , from the day he came onto this ship , and probably will be all his life . You have all the makings of a good sailor , and you 're never going the route Mendoza has chosen . " " When does he actually go to the big brig , sir ? " " In a few days , as soon as the verdict of the special court-martial is confirmed . " Moser extracted another tiny part of the machine gun in front of him and dropped it into the cleaning pan . Stuart waited . " Sir , I know Juan stole , an ' cheated at cards , an ' I guess I know he was dealin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe what folks said , but I know . Juan got me into things , sure , but he always came to me . The other guys do n't even talk to me . " " Moser , I talk to you . " For another week , then what ? I wonder if I should tell him I 'm leaving ? " And the chief talks to you . All Mendoza ever did was get you into trouble . " " You talk to me , sir , when you 're not busy , an ' I know you 're busy now , gettin ' ready to leave , and all . The chief , well mostly he jest yells . " " What about me leaving , Moser ? " " I heard you bin transferred off the Valley , to some unit back over in Nam . Ai n't it true , sir ? " Moser seemed to cheer up a little . " It 's true , Moser , but nobody is supposed to know until a new division officer is named . " " That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sir ? Do you like me , sir ? " " Sure , I like you , Moser . " Stuart smiled . He did like big Moser . " I know , sir . " Moser seemed suddenly happy . " Then , kin I gowith you in country ? " Stuart felt surprised , amused , and flattered . " Well , Moser , that 's nice of you , but you have an important job here , and the war 's a little dangerous . " " I do n't care , sir ! You see , I like you , too . " " Well , Moser , I  --  " " You ' member , Lieutenant , when you took that convoy of mike boats up the Cua Viet , an ' you took me along , me an ' the long-barreled fifty ? An ' I shot them gooks on the riverbank ? " " Well , sure , but  --  " " This here 's the same gun ! " said Moser , pointing to the parts in the tray . " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to volunteer if'n yo ' ever agin needed someone to guard your back ? Well , sir , you 're goin ' in harm 's way , and I 'm volunteerin ' ! " Stuart was moved . He shook his head , and smiled at the big man . " Moser , now all that 's true , and I sure appreciate what you 've done for me , but why in hell would you want to go into the shit with me ? " " Well , sir , I 've thought about it . I don ' like ' at many people . You always stood up fer me when I got into trouble . " Moser actually looked eager . " OK , Moser. "  | " ' Sides , somebody got to cover your back , Lieutenant . " " OK , but I do n't think I can take you with me , Moser . " Moser looked a little hurt . Damn . " Sir , I 'd really like to go with you . " The big man 's voice was soft , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The guy did save my life ; I had almost forgotten . I can at least try . " OK , Moser . I 'll talk to the people . "  |p311Billy  sat on his bunk , the parts of his M-14 spread out in front of him . Smith lay dozing across from him on Trace 's bunk . Trace and Smith rarely left Hunter alone anymore ; Billy knew they were watching him , but he did n't mind . He rather liked the company . " What 's the rumor of the day , Smith ? " Smith sat up . " Hey , Sarge . You feelin ' better ? " Billy smiled . It 's important to put my friends ' minds at ease . " Yeah , better each day . I just keep eating and sleeping good , I 'll be one hundred percent in a coupla more days . So what have I missed ? " " Not much . You gave us a scare , blacking out like that . " Billy remembered everything that had happened before he went into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me for a turn . " " You , ah , remember much about that day , when you blacked out ? " " Not really . A few things , but fuzzy . " Sure , I remember it all , Smith ; who could ever forget such horror ? But I have it locked away in a tiny part of my brain now , knowledge waiting to be used . " I just remember you and Trace helping me . " Smith looked relieved . " Hey , Sarge , don ' mean nothing . Man 's got ta look after his buddies . " Smith smiled happily . Billy smiled back , completing reassembly of his weapon . Be relieved , Smith , you did the right thing.  |p312Trace  came in and sat . " You lookin ' a little better , Billy . " " Yeah , stronger every day . The captain got any work for us , Trace ? " Trace grinned . " You anxious to nightcrawl , Bro ? " Billy shrugged . " Yeah , I guess I am . Sit around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Billy waited to see how they would take that one . Trace frowned . Smith looked at Trace , and then down at his feet . Trace spoke softly , " Guess there 's a lot you still do n't want to think about , Bro . " Billy played his face . He hoped he looked manly and grieving at the same time . Trace and Smith must be made to feel at ease . " Well , of course . But I want to put all that behind me . A little walk in the darkness might be just the thing to make me feel better . " Billy chuckled inside his mind . It was funny how almost anything you said had a double meaning when you had a secret . Trace seemed to relax a little . " Yeah , we 've all been in camp too long . Anyway , we 're still at max readiness , bags packed and canteens full , but the captain does n't have anything down for us for today or tomorrow . " " Anybody in the squad got any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Trace stood up . " Nothing getting at you you ca n't handle , Sergeant Hunter . You a marine and a nightcrawler . You tough enough . " Hunter stood and slapped Trace 's shoulder . He made his face gentle . " I got to thank you two for helping me through it . I think I 'll just go see the captain and volunteer us for Vinh Linh . " Trace and Smith laughed nervously at the old joke . When the Marine Corps had first moved into northeastern I Corps , some gung-ho second lieutenant had written a staff memo declaring the market town of Vinh Linh , some seven kilometers inside North Vietnam , to be an ideal target for a commando raid . LRRPs all tossed occasionally in their sleep fearing some rear-area idiot might actually order such an operation . Hunter left the hootch and strolled over to the wood and corrugated steel building that housed the company office . He could see Trace and Smith follow ten paces behind , then Smith put his hand on Trace 's shoulder , and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ captain in his office talking to a young black second lieutenant . " Sorry to interrupt , sir , I 'll come back . " " No , come in , Sergeant . This is Second Lieutenant Edward Brown . He just reported in , and I 'm putting him in charge of your patrol squad . " Lieutenant Brown jumped up and wrung Ilunter 's hand.  |p313Strange  , thought Billy , for weeks I have wanted an officer to take some of the load , yet now I 'm not so sure . " Welcome to LRRPs , sir . " " Thank you , Sergeant , Hunter , is n't it ? Captain Rodriguez has nothing but praise for the way you 've run your squad . I only hope I wo n't get in the way . " The lieutenant smiled winningly ; the captain looked sour . The captain stood . " I think we 're through here , Lieutenant . Why do n't you take a walk with Hunter , look around ? Hunter , you could drop the lieutenant by the officers ' mess when you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ah , sir ? A question ? " " Go ahead . " " Sir , the guys are kind of curious about why it 's so quiet . We going up any time soon ? " The captain managed his sardonic half smile . " I did n't know your men were such fire-eaters , Sergeant Hunter . No , nothing is imminent , but I take note of your zeal . " " Ah , yes , sir . The men are just restless , that 's all . " Hunter thought of adding a salute , but decided that would be way overdoing it . Once again , he heard the chuckle inside his brain . The captain regarded him skeptically . " You 're feeling better , Hunter ? " " Yes , sir ! Ready to go . " " Hunter had a bit of a malaria problem last week , " said the captain in answer to Lieutenant Brown 's unspoken question . " You were sick enough that the doc wanted to send you home , Sergeant . " Hunter remembered that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had left him near panic . He had assured the navy doctor that he was fit to return to duty , and the doctor had reluctantly agreed to send him back to his unit . " It was just malaria , Captain . Everybody has malaria . " It 's just Nam , he wanted to say , and I 'm not done with Nam , yet . The captain smiled . " Well , anyway , I 'm glad you 're feeling good . You 're too good a man to lose . Until later , then , Lieutenant Brown ? " Hunter walked out into the fading twilight , with Brown following. 19 May 1967Hunter flagged a passing six-by truck and rode over to Camp Five . He got down by the little commissary and bought a pack of ' cigarettes . Hep314then strolled in the general direction of Whitenigger 's hootch , taking in details of the surrounding area . Camp Five was larger than Camp Seven , but laid out in much the same way , with offices , machine shops , mess halls , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in rings surrounding the central area , and the wire with guard towers beyond . Whitenigger 's sturdily constructed hootch was in the inner ring , a preferred spot , near the earthwork-revetted vehicle park . It was a nice location , and a nice hootch , built on a platform about eighteen inches above the damp earth on columns of cinder blocks . It even had a metal roof instead of the tent-canvas roof usual for sleeping hootches . Very snug indeed , thought Hunter , walking slowly around , smoking his pack of Camels one by one . He looked at paths , and alleys between buildings , and at the guard towers . Lines and shadows , he thought . A hand grasped his left wrist lightly . He jumped ; he had n't heard or felt anyone approach . He looked into the scowling face of Corporal Crow . Hunter worked his face into a smile , suppressing alarms from the special corner of his brain . " Hello , Crow . I was just coming to see First Sergeant Johnson . " " He send for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beads of hatred . " No , but we got business . " " What kinda bid-ness ? " " Same 's we talked . Dealing . " " What about you ' own source ? " Stupid men should never try to act clever , thought Hunter , deep in his brain . Still , I want him to think , and then to doubt . " Got blown away . I was getting it from the old dink in the ville near our wire . VC got ' em , you musta heard . " Crow looked at Hunter with hooded eyes . " I heard , white boy . " " Sergeant White Boy to you , Corporal , " said Hunter , amiably . Crow seethed . He looks like a rattlesnake ready to strike , thought Hunter . He willed himself to stay loose . " Forget that rank shit , Sergeant Asshole ! Where Whitenigga involved , Crow beat out any damn mothafuckasergeant ! " Good , get angry , Crow , thought Hunter . " Well , anyway , let 's go see First @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " How do you know that , Crow ? "  | " Cause it my bid-ness to know when he is an ' when he ai n't , white boy . Now , scat . " Billy took a step backward , held his hands up , palms forward , " Hey , no sweat , I 'll come back . " " You take ma ad-vice , white boy , you come when he call you . He don ' call , you , you don ' got no bid-ness here . " " I 'll keep it in mind , Corporal , " said Hunter , turning . He walked back to the gate , and once again caught a passing truck , and returned to Camp Seven . That should play just about right , he thought , rubbing at the constant , sharp pain in his temples . Three more days , he thought ; in three days there would be no moon , and the dead would rise. 21 May 1987 " So , what do you think , Smith ? " said Trace , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man . " " Not different ? " Trace pressed . " OK , he is different . He seems almost old . What do you think ? " Trace paced inside the narrow hootch . " He looks at me like he 's very sad about something . Not angry , just sad . " " Like it might be the last time he ever does see you . " Trace whirled , and pointed his finger at Smith , " Exactly ! Like you was already dead , or he was ! " Smith nodded , " Like he 's trying to be extraspecial kind . " " Yeah , " said Trace , pounding his fist into his hand . " He 's sure right about one thing . If we could get him out in the field , then we 'd know . " Smith sipped his beer . Taps would sound in another twenty minutes . " He 's in his bunk , right ? " " Yeah . Still claims he needs the extra sleep . " Smith shifted his weight in the uncomfortable chair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Trace . Why you so uptight tonight ? " Trace slugged down the last of his Budweiser . " I do n't know , man . Just something about the dude ! Like , he 's just different ! " Trace again pounded his fist into his hand in frustration . " Shit , man , I do n't fuckin ' know ! Maybe it 's just the night , the night and no moon . " Smith laughed , " Us darkies always get strange in the dark o ' the moon , Trace ... " hick you , nigger . " Trace fought hack a twinge of anger.  | " Hoo , hoo , " laughed Smith . " I 'm goin ' to bed . " " Hey , Trace my man , I really think he 's OK . Real sad , but cool . " " Good night , Smith . " " Good night , man . If you need me , I 'll be close . " Hunter heard Trace come into the hootch , and he felt his friend bending over his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my good friend ? Trace went to bed across the passageway . Hunter listened until his breathingbecame regular , then he looked at his watch , 2210 . Another hour , a bit less . He would need the time in hand , once it began . He felt hot ; beneath the sheet he was dressed in uniform trousers in addition to his T-shirt . He would feel better once he began to move . Hunter drifted into light sleep , waking every twenty minutes or so to check the luminous dial . At 2305 , he declared it a go . Like a snake descending a rock pile , Hunter slithered down from his bed onto the wood floor . He made contact with the floor first with his fingertips , then his palms , then his elbows , chest , knees , and finally his bare feet . His ears were tuned up for the slightest sound , either from his own movement , or from Trace . Flat on the floor , he crawled silently from the hootch , caressing his boots to him as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulled on his boots . The rest of his gear was in a small pouch the marines called a kangaroo , originally designed to carry battle dressings , which Hunter had hidden earlier in the space under the hootch . Out of the kangaroo Hunter took a pair of green socks , which he put on over his boots to stifle the crunch of gravel . He left the wire cutters , a short spool of wire , his spring-steel knife , and two frag grenades in the pouch , which he now secured around his waist . He put a length of flat bamboo into his left boot . Hunter took a jar of camouflage face paint from under the hootch , and daubed his face , neck , and arms below the sleeves of his T-shirt in the dim light of the floods by the wire . In five minutes he was ready , and walking , slowly and deliberately , toward the wire . The best spot to cross the wire was through the shallow ravine that ran out to the creek and the ville , because it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floods that illuminated the cleared zone on both sides of the wire . Hunter reached the back of the hootch closest to the wire in slow , silent steps . Standing in the deep shadow of the hcxotch , hep317studied the guard tower , watching the movement of the two sentries , who took turns peering out at the jungle . He examined the ground between the shadow he was in , inch by inch , even though he had walked over it two evenings before . He felt the texture of the night , the color of the shadows . In fifteen minutes he was once again ready to move . Hunter felt he could probably rush to the little ravine , but decided against it . He dropped to the ground silently , and began to move in what the infiltration instructors had called the lizard . Moving first an arm , then the opposite leg , then the other arm , then the other leg , and with intervals of stillness , Hunter emerged from the shadow and became a shadow himself . Moving smoothly , sinuously , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oil flowing slowly across a smooth , shiny surface . He slipped over the top of the ravine and disappeared into it without even the smallest sound . Flowing oil is silent , he told himself , repeating it like a mantra . Flowing blood is silent . The chain-link fence around the camp was well dug in , and Hunter slipped the cutters from the pouch and made eight careful cuts , six horizontal and two vertical . He lay against the wire , perfectly still , and then flowed through . He pulled the cut pieces together , and fastened them at the corners with short lengths of wire . Outside the wire , the floodlights were brighter than inside , and the sentries had movable searchlights to supplement the fixed illumination . And , naturally , the sentries looked outward . Hunter took a deep breath to slow his heart , and began to move again . He crawled along the outer edge of the wire , using the lizard . He paused frequently , and finally stopped under the shadow of the guard tower itself , resting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bamboo ladder as the relieving sentries started up . They laughed and talked . When they reached the top , a conversation began among the two sentries going off watch and the two coming on . As they chatted , discussing the night and the watch , Hunter made his slow , very slow , and painful passage through the concertinawire outside the fence . Lifting himself on fingers and toes , he flowed over the lowest wire , under the higher , changing direction as the coils of wire changed . When he came to a trip flare , he gently supported it with one hand ; the fuses of the flares were mercury switches , triggered by the acceleration of a fall . Once supported , they were easily cut off and laid down on the ground , harmless . Hunter flowed through , as smooth as oil , but even still , his face and arms ran with fresh blood from the wire . He reached the outer edge of the concertina , and paused , listening.  |p318A  bark of laughter burst from the tower , and Hunter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ launched himself into the darkness , sprawling like a lizard , flowing like oil . I am invisible , he chanted . Once the searchlight swept across his body , and he froze , suspended on fingertips , one knee , and the toes of one foot . I am a shadow , he thought . The light swept on without pause . Hunter crawled , arm , leg , pause ; arm , leg , pause . He entered the deep shadow of the trees . Hunter relaxed , taking deep , measured breaths , examining the layout of Camp Seven 's defenses , refiguring his way back , for he for sure was going to come back . The shadows all pointed out to the jungle . How easy for an infiltrator , he thought . Satisfied after ten minutes of study , he was up and running through the trees , toward the lights of Camp Five . When he reached the point in the shadows of the trees nearest his selected point of entry , he stopped once again , and studied the night . A light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ background . The fine drops diffused the lights of Camp Five . The shadow of Billy Hunter crept into the lighted area , in a sinuous , snake-lizard line , making for the guard tower nearest the hootch of Whitenigger Johnson . Hunter 's mind suffused his being into the lizard , silent , intent on scented prey . Whitenigger Johnson sat in his big chair behind his desk , stacking money in neat piles . Tonight was payday for his little group , and he was satisfied . Drugs had proven a much more dependable source of revenue than the petty graft he had organized in exchange for contracts for booze , food , and entertainment for the officers , sergeants , and EM clubs , and since the elimination of the old gook 's drug push by Camp Seven , the monopoly was total . He had been disturbed by Crow 's report of Sergeant Hunter 's showing up near his hootch two days before , but Crow worried a lot , and Hunter had n't been back . Hunter reached the wire of Camp Five , and started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tower . I am the snake , the snake with legs , the fire lizard . The twenty feet of concertina took him two minutes to pass , an arm , then a leg . The trip flares , backlit by the camp 's floodlights , were cut off , and laid down . Billy probed ahead of his advance for Claymores with his flat piece of bamboo ; he found only one . He pulled the cap and the detonator wires . He slid on , snake-self , till he was flat against the fence.  |p319From  under his bunk Whitenigger pulled the rucksack full of dope that had been taken from the old gook 's hootches . He realized the potential of the haul , even if Crow and Zits had not . Four blocks of pure opium , and stacks of tightly rolled joints much too fragrant to be marijuana . If he had known what the old fool had , Whitenigger would have done business with the gook rather than kill him . Still , he had this , and as a reward , it would please Crow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free of alarm . The tower above him was quiet , except for a low murmur of voices . He cut through the chain link , repeating his actions at the fence at Camp Five , except that he did not wire the corners . He picked up his lines from his earlier study , and slid-crawled from light into shadow , to the first building , where he paused , then on through the silent camp to the revetted vehicle park . Once again , he stopped , pressed into the shadow of the earthwork . He saw a figure moving behind him , and pressed himself into the ground , breathing suspended . As the figure entered the light in front of Whitenigger'shootch , Hunter recognized it as Crow . Billy waited , listening to Crow 's boots grinding in the gravel , and his labored breathing . Billy smiled , and the voices inside his brain cheered . Crow climbed the steps to Whitenigger 's hootch , and slipped inside . Stay awhile , willed Hunter 's brain . Hunter stood up , and slipped into the vehicle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the darkened park Hunter found a jeep with a steel gasoline can fastened to its tailboard with web straps . He pressed his body tightly against the can to muffle any sound , released the clasps , then lifted the can out of its holder onto the ground . Shaking the can gently , he determined that it was almost full . Half full was what he needed , so he carried the can deeper into the vehicle park , looking for a spot to dump some gas where the smell would n't immediately carry back to the sentry . He found a row of empty cans , and poured off about half the contents of his can , then returned to the front of the park . The sentry had n't stirred . Hunter made his way from the park to a machine shop , which had an overhanging roof , and sat in the deep shadow , studying the approach to Whitenigger 's hootch . He felt a little sick wave of fever wash up from his stomach and into his aching head , but it passed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said a voice in his brain . Hunter started forward , holding the can just above the ground , gliding it , so the contents would n't slosh . Ile moved from shadow to shadow . ' life only lighted part of the passage was just before the hack of thep320hootch . Hunter crossed the lighted patch in a crab crawl , dragging the can beside him , and flowed between the cinder blocks and under the hootch . He listened to the muffled voices above him , then pulled the can on its side to the place where the voices were loudest . He took off the kangaroo , and got out the spring-steel knife . He traced the can with the knife in the dirt , moved the can aside , then began removing the soft earth from within the trace marks . Crow sat across from Whitenigger at the desk . They both had their feet up and were drinking beer , ignoring , for the moment , the piles of money between them . Crow was holding one of the tightly rolled joints he had taken from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turning it over , inspecting it . " So yo think this shit special , Whitenigga ? " " Yeah . Soon 's Zits get heah , we gon na smoke us a couple . Toast our good frien ' Sar n't Hunta ! " Whitenigger laughed , a wheezing , unpleasantsound . Hunter heard footsteps approaching the hootch . He froze , directing all his attention to his ears . The footsteps reached the front of the hootch , and rasped up the cinder-block steps . The man stepped inside , and the plywood floor groaned under his weight . He sat along the wall , and the hootch shook , then settled . A third voice was added to the muffled conversation . Zits ! thought Hunter . Hurry ! said the voice inside his brain . Hunter pulled the gasoline can into the shallow depression , and shaped the loose earth around it , packing it tight right up to the edge of the can . He held his knife down close to the point , where there was a can-opening hook . He pressed the point into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broke through with a tiny tearing sound . He stopped and listened , then began cutting through the side of the can , using the wire cutters and the knife . Whitenigger passed out the bonus money to Crow and Zits , and they each had a beer . Zits started to get up , but Whitenigger stopped him . " I suggest , gennle-men , that we all try some a t'is special shit y'all brought back from yo ' little raid ! " Zits giggled nervously . He liked to think about that raid . Crow lit the first joint , and placed it between Whitenigger 's lips . He lit one for himself , then tossed the third and the matchbook to Zits.  |p321The  hootch filled with sweet gray smoke . " Hoo , wow , " said Zits . Conversationceased . Below , Hunter struggled to cut the can . It was proving far more difficult than he had figured . He smelled the dope , and smiled . Have another joint , he prayed . Hurry ! said the voice inside his brain . Whitenigger finished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shit is heavy ! I am sailing ! He looked across at Crow , who was smiling , eyes closed , trying to get the last of the roach . Whitenigger plucked the roach from Crow 's fingers , and handed him another joint . " We got plenty , Babe ! " Crow opened his eyes . " Wow , huh , " he giggled , " wow . " He took the fresh joint , and carefully lit it . He and Whitenigger shared it , passing it back and forth . On the other side of the room , Zits rolled against the wall , and began to snore . Crow kicked his legs down from the desk and stood up . The room took an agreeable roll , then steadied . Crow strolled around the desk , and sat on it , next to Whitenigger 's legs . He placed his hand lightly on Whitenigger 's thigh , then began to massage his crotch . He could feel Whitenigger 's sex stirring inside his uniform . Whitenigger closed his eyes , and sighed a slow , hissing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fingers , and set it in the ashtray . With slow fingers , he unbuttoned Whitenigger 's trousers and freed his sex . He bent his head over Whitenigger 's crotch . " You want your daddy , Crow ? " breathed Whitenigger . Crow nodded . " Show me , Crow , sweet baby . " Crow got up slowly , unbuckled his trousers , and let them fall , then climbed up onto the cot on his knees . Hunter had the hole in the gasoline can complete enough that he could bend the inner piece up and away like the lid of a tin can . He was soaking wet and shivering from the exertion and the fever . The odor of gasoline was strong in the confined space , and he hoped the men in the hootch would not smell it and come to find its source . He laid two frag grenades , their spoons taped to their bodies with surgical tape , next to the can , then pulled himself to the hack of the hootch to look around . fie looked and listened for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ile crawled hack in , picked up the first grenadep322and pulled the pin , and dropped it into the gasoline . He pulled the second grenade 's pin , and dropped it in alongside the first . He knew the surgical tape would hold the spoons down , and thus the grenades harmless , until the gasoline dissolved the adhesive , but he had no firm idea how long that might take . He crawled out from under the hootch , and started back down his lines and shadows toward the wire . Whitenigger knelt behind Crow , admiring his smooth , muscular black ass . He massaged the rippling muscles of Crow 's back and shoulders and pressed his body against the much darker man 's , admiring the contrast in their color . Against the wall , Zits snored like a buzz saw . Hunter was through the wire and the concertina when he heard a sharp crack of explosion , followed by a whoosh of flame . Knowing that the sentries in the towers would look inward , he jumped up and sprinted for the trees , following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he turned and looked back . The flames were rising fifty , maybe seventy feet high behind the row of hootches that shielded the center of the camp from view . Men running toward the flames cast long , jumping shadows , radiating out all the way to the trees . Hunter looked for a full minute , etching the picture permanently into his brain , then ran for Camp Seven . Twenty minutes later , Hunter snaked back through the wire at Camp Seven , and slipped into the head . He was still shivering and sweating , but he could feel his fever dropping . He showered thoroughly , and dressed in the clean uniform he had stashed in the head . He dropped the dirty uniform in the laundry bag , except for the socks he had worn over his boots , which he put in the waste bin , under the paper towels . Carrying his boots , he crossed the quiet camp to his hootch , and crawled along the floor to his bunk . He snake-climbed in , and drew the blanket up to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he whispered . Thank you , Bi-lee , she said . Hunter was instantly sound asleep . Across the tent , Trace looked at his watch , 0210 . Whatever Billy had to do , it 's done.  |p323Bobby  Coles dropped his seabag outside the hootch that served as the field office of the ANGLICO detachment attached to the 197th Light Infantry Brigade . The office was a rude wooden structure , made out of the sides of large packing crates resting on a raised platform of planks . The peaked roof was made of tent canvas . Someone had built a railing along the front of the floor where it jutted out three feet beyond the front of the building , which gave the air of a little balcony . The whole structure could n't have measured more than twelve by fifteen feet . Coles was tired from his long journey , from California via Hawaii and Guam to Okinawa , where he had undergone a refresher in night exercises and small-unit tactics . He had then gone on to Danang , where he reported to the commanding officer of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who seemed a pretty decent type . He expected to be able to rest and get oriented to the company and its mission while in Danang , but the platoon sergeant of the detachment with the 197th had become very ill with malaria , and was evacuated to the naval hospital in Honolulu , so Coles was sent right down . Coles straightened his uniform prior to entering the office , where he was to report to the detachment 's commander , a navy Lieutenant ( junior grade ) named Robinson . Major MacIntyre had told him nothing of Robinson , other than he was a good officer . Coles felt nervous andp324ill-prepared to step right into a combat assignment , but he also felt a strange sense of relief that he was finally here . From here , one could begin to think of going home . Coles rapped on the door , and a quiet voice said " Enter , " without inflection . Coles pushed open the door , and went in . Coles came to attention and saluted . The officer waved him to a chair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Yes , sir , reporting as ordered . " Coles 's mood jumped a notch . Lieutenant Robinson was black ! A black officer in an elite unit was a very good start , he thought . Robinson was a short man , not more than five feet six . He had a smooth , intelligent face , and looked rather scholarly . Robinson moved a few papers around his tiny desk , apparently without purpose . He 's nervous , thought Coles , as he waited . " Well , then , Sergeant Coles , welcome to the ANGLICO . " " Glad to be here , sir , hope I can be of use . " The lieutenant beamed , " I 'm sure you can . Sergeant Macon was good , very good , but , I must confess , I found him at times difficult . " Coles was on his guard . " In what sense , sir ? " " He was white , Sergeant , " said Robinson , dryly , " and he tried to compensate for what he viewed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know what I mean . " Coles thought he did . " Yes , sir . " " Good , good , Coles . Have you met the men ? " " Not yet , sir , but I 'm anxious to . " Lieutenant Robinson took off his steel-rimmed glasses . " They 're good men , Sergeant , though green . But you 'll like them . " This conversation is not what I expected , thought Coles . The lieutenantis preoccupied with something else . " Shall I go and meet them , sir ? " Lieutenant Robinson smiled , " Yes , of course . You 'll find them in a twelve-man tent , on the end of the second rank , that way , near the motor pool . " The lieutenant gestured absently . " I 've reviewed your record , Sergeant Coles ; I 'm convinced you 'll be a real asset . " " Sir , " said Bobby , leaving the dark office . There ai n't nothing in my record , he thought . Coles found the men of Lieutenant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their ease , getting ready for chow . They seemed an easy group of guys , friendly . Maybe a little too friendly ,  |p325thought  Coles ; I am the sergeant here , and they do n't know me . Take it easy , he told himself . " Tell me who you are , men . " " Adams , Sergeant , rifleman . Radio talker , now . " He was a tall , confident-looking white man , with a faintly midwestern accent . " From Chicago , " guessed Coles , trying to project friendship . " Close , Sergeant , " the man grinned easily , " Evanston , Illinois . " " I 'm Lancey Watts , Sergeant , " said a light-skinned black man with conked hair , " New Orleans . " Sergeant Coles nodded , and looked at the next man , a skinny black kid who was cleaning an M-16 between his knees . " Mo-rice Jackson , Sergeant ! The men call me Monkey ! " " OK , Monkey . " He looked at the next man . " Morgan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and restless , his voice pure New York . " Walker , Sarge , New Jersey . " Another black man , who looked proud . " M-sixty light machine gun . " " Cardenas , Sergeant , Los Angeles . Medical , and radioman . " A dark-skinned Mexican who sounded educated . Coles nodded . " Staples , radioman , Sergeant . " A heavy-set white man with an earnest expression . Coles looked at his hands . " Now , tell me what we do here . I 'm anxious to learn . " The unit received orders into the field on the following day . The lieutenant , visibly agitated , came down to the hootch himself to tell them to build their rucks and be ready to move out at 1400 . The army scout teams had cut some fresh trails in the paddy country to the north , along the banks of the Song Tra Khuc . Song meant river , the first Vietnameseword Coles had learned . The Army had decided to let a navy destroyer , which was lying off the coast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operations , take the mission . The Army , Coles had been told , was a little skeptical about the navy 's ability to deliver supportingfire with precision , so the Army preferred to limit the destroyers to harrassment and interdiction  --  H and I  --  fire missions , like the one against these newfound trails . Precision fire , close to the troops , was kept to the brigade 's own artillery . Nevertheless , the ship would need a spot , and it was a chance for the unit to prove its worth . The men seemed anxious to go , to try it on . " You mean you guys have n't ever made a real spot before ? " asked Coles . " That 's right . Sergeant Brotha ! " said Monkey , lifting his pack.  |p326The  little man could n't really be expected to hump a thirty-pound radio , so he was designated as a runner . Staples , Adams , Morgan , and Cardenas carried the unit 's four radios . " We go out with de grunts , we come back . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " added Morgan . Coles 's mind reeled . I 'm in charge of these men , and neither they nor I have any experience whatsoever in real conditions . " How about the lieutenant ? He been there ? " asked Coles , almost dreading the answer . Cardenas spoke softly , " He 's been to school , Sergeant . Did n't nobody tell you this was a green outfit ? " They told me it was an elite outfit , thought Bobby , feeling angry . Well , we 'll just have to make it one . " We 'll get old quickly enough , Cardenas . " The unit was formed up and loaded into big twin-rotored CH-47 helos at the pad in the middle of the huge encampment . They were going up with an infantry company to do a sweep and map the trails . This was Coles 's first experience with helicopters in Vietnam . He had been trained in them in California , but they always landed on concrete pads ; he was unprepared for the volume of dirt and grit that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and mouth , as well as practically filling the shirt of his uniform . When he finally got on board the aircraft , he noted that his men had buttoned their uniforms all the way to the neck , and had covered their faces with bandannas or small green army-issue towels . Monkey removed his black kerchief and grinned impishly , leaning close and shouting above the engine noise as the helo took off . " Do n't worry ' bout us bein ' green , Sarge . Wait 'll you see some of the things the Army fucks up . " Coles grinned , suddenly . Of course . Relax , let it flow . This is Vietnam . He gave Monkey a thumbs-up sign , and Monkey and Adams and Morgan all gave it back to him . The rest of the unit was with Lieutenant Robinson in another helo . The infantry company swept slowly through the AO . The evidence of Viet Cong passage was tenuous at best , but it was there  --  footprints and faint wheel marks , all one ever expected to find . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the banks , the land was cultivated into paddy ; the spring rice had already been transplanted , and had grown to a height of two feet . The peasants who tendedp327the crops had faded away from the helicopters and the tramping soldiers . All the villages were empty and silent . Coles joined his men with the lieutenant 's group , and followed , as the infantry led them to the crossing paths that had been discovered . The unit moved the destroyer Morton into position to fire . The infantry company commander cleared his soldiers well back , and Lieutenant Robinsoncalled for the first shot . The theory of H and I fire was to force the enemy to abandon his carefully prepared trails . Lieutenant Robinson would spot for the destroyer , and then the soldiers would pull back . The destroyer would calibrate and store the coordinates of their target , and probably several others called in by other spotters , in her gunfire-control computer , then return at night to lob shells onto the crossroad at irregular intervals . As a spotting mission , it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coles watched the lieutenant ; he looked excited , and his fingers tapped the gunfire plotting board he held on his knees , waiting for the shot to fall in . The infantry commander , an army captain , watched with a smirk that angered Coles . Get it right , dammit , he thought , looking hard at Robinson 's back . The spotting round landed with a flat report and a burst of orange smoke well beyond and to the right of the crossing paths . Robinson spun the board , and called the spot back to Adams , who put it on the radio to the destroyer . The next shot was still beyond the silent target , and even farther to the right . Robinson was beginning to sweat . He adjusted the board again , and shouted back to Adams . The third shot faded into the jungle , almost too far away to see . " Fuckin ' Navy , " snorted the company commander , behind Coles . Coles heard other laughter , and he crawled forward to Robinson . He looked at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Robinson was near panic . The destroyer 's call for spot was crackling in Adams 's radio . Robinson looked at Coles without speaking . " Lieutenant , the solution is wrong . You , ah , did n't adjust line of sight to the gun-target line . " The lieutenant did n't move ; he seemed frozen . Gently , Coles took the plotting board from Robinson 's unresisting fingers , and adjusted it with the aid of his hand compass . " Adams , spot . Left , two mils , to me . Drop five hundred . " The five-inch shell landed on the crossroad , spraying dust and belching orange smoke . " OK , Adams , tell ' cm they 're on . " " Yes , Sergeant , " said Adams , obviously relieved.  | " We 're done here , sir , " said Coles , softly . " Right , " said Lieutenant Robinson . " Quite . Spot is in , for tonight , Captain James . " " Thanks , Navy , " said the company commander , with exaggerated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was pleased to see the captain look away . We 're all just learning , thought Coles , looking anger at the army captain 's back . The infantry continued its assigned sweep , found nothing and saw no one other than a scrawny Vietnamese peasant with two small children , all riding on a water buffalo . Buffalo were too valuable to be left alone , even when threatened by Viet Cong or Americans . I wonder who the old guy fears most , mused Coles . The company set up a perimeter around the dry field that had been designated the landing zone for the helos . Most of the men lounged around , smoking and eating C-rations . Nobody seems to be taking this war too seriously , thought Coles . The helos came , and they piled into the one with their letter taped to the door , passing the door-gunner , who at least looked watchful as he scanned the trees along the river bank . The helicopter took off with a jerk , and in ten minutes they were back on the ground inside the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hear some kind of announcement from their CO . The ANGLICO marines just kind of wanderedoff in the direction of their hootch . This unit is fucked up , thought Coles to himself , his face burning . And that is going to change . He quickened his step and caught up with the men in the hootch . Most were picking up shower kits , and Monkey was snapping his towel at Cardenas 's rump just as Coles entered . There was laughter , and it deepened Coles 's anger . " Ten-HUT ! " he said , just loudly enough so that there could be no doubt that he meant it . The men fell silent , and assumed the posture of attention , looking faintly ridiculous , holding towels , bars of soap , pieces of uniform . Coles paced back and forth in the confined space , and scowled his worst street face , heated with genuine anger . Most of the men looked the blank look every marine learns in boot camp ; do n't notice me , the look said . Monkey was unable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the face for ten seconds before the little man swallowed the smirk with a bobbing of his prominent Adam 's apple . Coles began speaking , very softly , but with an edge of iron in his voice . " Where were you men going ? Staples ? "  | " Ta  --  ta the head , sir  --  Sergeant , " Staples replied , keeping his eyes blank and exactly straight ahead . Coles looked at Staples for half a minute , then walked down the line of totally silent men . They did n't seem to breathe . " Do I take that to mean that everyone of you men has already cleaned his personal weapon ? Jackson ! " Coles pushed his face to within an inch of Monkey 's as he spoke his name , and the little man jumped . " No , Sergeant . But none of us even fired our weapons today . " " But they got dirty , did n't they , men ? The dust on the LZ alone will have gotten them dirty . " " Gee , Sarge , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the end of the barrel ; it keeps the dirt out . We shoulda told you  --  " " What ? " snapped Coles , his eyes inches from Adams 's . The rest of Adams 's sentence died in his throat . " Sergeant , " began Walker . Coles rounded on him , but Walker kept on speaking , with a slow , firm voice . I want this man on my side fast , thought Coles . " We may be a little sloppy . We are sloppy . But with due respect , Sergeant , this is Vietnam . It 's different here . " Coles moved close to Walker , and studied his smooth black face . Coles 's own face lost its anger . He had their attention , now he had to win them over . He turned away from Walker , then turned back to address the group as a whole . " Men , I know this is Vietnam . Let me tell you what little else I know . This is the United States Marine Corps , and we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the middle of a bunch of sad-ass draftee soldiers makes it all the more important we remember , every minute , that we are marines . If the Army wants to put condoms over the muzzles of their weapons rather than clean them , that 's their lookout , but we will clean our weapons , and oil them , and inspect our ammunition . Men , the unit I saw in front of me in the field today was fucked up , and I , Coles , Sergeant Coles  --  " Bobby jabbed his chest with his thumb , and looked at each man in turn "  --  does not ride with any fucked-up outfit . " Coles walked to his bunk and picked up his M-16 , locked the action open , and reached into his ruck for the rifle cleaning kit . Without a word , the men began cleaning and oiling their weapons . Coles heard a few whispered complaints , caught the word " ball-buster , " and ignored it . Bobby cleaned his weapon slowly , watching as the men did likewise . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was . Bobby finished cleaning the weapon , then popped the ammo out ofp330the magazine and wiped off each round . The M-16 was prone to jam ; some said it was just too precise a weapon to be used in the normal , dirty conditions of combat . Bobby put seventeen cartridges back into the twenty-round clip , and locked the weapon away . He looked at the men , and smiled slightly . " Probably just time for a shower before chow , hey , Marines ? " There was a little banter as the men went off to shower , but very little . It felt to Bobby as though an embarrassing truth had been revealed to them all , and they were n't quite sure how to deal with it . The awkward silence and nervousness persisted through the evening meal . When the men returned to the hootch , Bobby took a walk . Let them work it out themselves . They do n't have to like it , or like me , but they are going to be marines , and they are going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told me I was going to have an elite unit , and I shall . Bobby walked around the camp for more than an hour , gradually cooling off , and thinking about what he was going to do next to build his unit . As he approached the tent , he still had no clear idea . A figure rose from a seat on the wooden floor of the tent , and walked toward him . Coles recognized Walker in the dim light . " Walk a bit farther , Sergeant ? " " Sure , Walker . " They walked in silence , back along the row of tents , out to the big parade ground in the center of the camp . After a silent minute , Walker spoke . " I guess you felt you had to say those things , Sergeant . " " I guess I did . " " And I guess I 'm the man responsible for the way things are . Were . I 'm a corporal , was acting sergeant until you came in . " " It was n't my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm concerned , we 've started over , as of today . I want a good unit , that 's all . " " Fine , Sergeant , and I 'll help , if you 'll let me . " Coles looked at Walker . He was the same height as Coles , and he returned Coles 's look . " I appreciate that , Walker . I think the men will be fine . " " They 're OK , Sergeant , but right now they 're angry . " Coles stopped . " Angry because I told them to shape up ? " " The way they look at it , Sergeant , you yelled at them because you could n't yell at the lieutenant . " " I do n't follow you , Walker . "
