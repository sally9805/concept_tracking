After closing this week 's cover story on the G.O.P. 's election strategy , 17 editors , writers and reporter-researchers from TIME 's Nation section left New York City for Dallas on the second of their quadrennial pilgrimages to the political conventions . Particularly in a carefully orchestrated gathering like the one planned by the Republicans , viewing the events on TV can not match the chance for firsthand observation . TIME 's staff members will have numerous opportunities for face-to-face encounters and candid conversations with key participants . In addition to the reception given by Time Inc . Edi for in Chief Henry Grunwald and the editors of TIME at the new Dallas Museum of Art on the convention 's opening evening , a series of on-the-record breakfasts , lunches and coffee meetings was scheduled . <P> Says Nation Senior Editor Stephen Smith : " To see top Republicans close up , away from the pressures of the convention hall , talking not only about the convention but also about political issues and problems stretching into the future , is one of the most productive features of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Franciso last month produced not only a special article on the party 's prospects , but also material for many of our other stories . " <P> Houston Bureau Chief David Jackson began preparing for the convention even before taking on his assignment to Texas last fall . " In fact , I 've spent as much time in Dallas as in Houston this year , " he says . " The empty folder on which I scribbled ' Dallas ' a year ago has grown to six fat ones , and I have visited the city several dozen times . " Jackson will put his knowledge to work this week covering the various parties and protests aimed , in quite different ways , at attracting the Republicans ' attention . <P> White House Correspondent Laurence Barrett has covered Ronald Reagan since the 1980 campaign ; last year Doubleday published Barrett 's Gambling with History , an account of the President 's first two years in office . Dallas , says Barrett , will be " something of a nostalgia trip . The first national convention I covered was in 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Francisco ; it was raucous in spirit and bitter in tone . Comparing ' 64 and ' 84 , when a conservative President is headed for a serene coronation in Dallas , is quite a commentary on the country 's political evolution . " <P> The anticipated tranquillity is somewhat reflected in TIME 's cover photograph this week . The two relaxed Republicans posed for their portrait by Dirck Halstead at the Reagan ranch near <P> Santa Barbara , Calif . On Thursday night the glowing pair will be , posing again , this time on the podium in Dallas as thousands of cameras capture the political moment of the week .
