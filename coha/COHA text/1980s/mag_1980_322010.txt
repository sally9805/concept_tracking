United Nations Security Council Resolution 465 , on Israeli settlements in the occupied territories , might not strike the casual reader as an inflammatory document . Yet in the arcane world of diplomacy , its language is unusually severe . It " strongly deplores " the settlements , calls them " a flagrant violation " of the Fourth Geneva Convention and cites " the grave consequences " that this Israeli policy may have on attempts to negotiate a permanent peace in the Middle East . The resolution is also rife with politics-laden buzz words to which Israeli officials and their American-Jewish supporters are particularly sensitive . <P> Most provocatively , the text refers seven times to " Jerusalem , " six times linking the city with the West Bank , the Gaza Strip and the Golan Heights . Three times in the preamble , and three times in its key operative paragraphs , it uses some variation of the phrase " Arab territories occupied by Israel since 1967 , including Jerusalem . " <P> The main punch is in para graphs six and seven . The sixth paragraph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... dismantle the existing settlements and in particular to cease , on an urgent basis , the establishment , construction and planning of settlements in the Arab territories occupied since 1967 , including Jerusalem . " The seventh paragraph " Calls upon all States not to provide Israel with any assistance to be used specifically in connection with settlements in the occupied territories . " <P> In two instances , the resolution also refers to " the Palestinian and other Arab territories ; " The Israelis object to the wording , since it seems to prejudge a crucial question still to be decided by the parties involved in Middle East negotiations-just which territories can be considered as belonging to the Palestinians ? <P> The only paragraph that was finally deleted from the resolution , at U.S. insistence , was one demanding that Israel " respect and guarantee religious freedoms and practices in Jerusalem and other holy places in the occupied Arab territories as well as the integrity of places of religious worship . " In fact , Israel 's observance of these guarantees has been so scrupulous as to defy criticism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
