A stranger coming upon Tobaccoville , N.C. , twelve miles north of Winston-Salem , might not be prepared for the sight . In the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains stands a sleek , Bauhaus-style building . This is R.J. Reynolds ' new $1 billion plant , which covers some 614 acres and 2 million sq . ft. of floor space . Still under construction , it will soon be the world 's largest cigarette factory . The plant will have the capacity to roll out more than 5 billion packs a year . <P> " It 's our vote of confidence in the tobacco industry , " says Donald Nanney , a factory manager of R.J. Reynolds ' . Only a few years ago , such a vote would have seemed unnecessary . Economic recessions came and went , prices continually climbed , but Americans always kept buying more and more cigarettes . Today , though , while the $18 billion tobacco industry remains very profitable , the element of predictability is gone . The industry is facing a spate of product-liability suits and , for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consumption . Unit sales peaked in 1981 , when Americans puffed on 640 billion cigarettes . By the end of this year , consumption is expected to be down 7% from that level . <P> Recent laws requiring harsher health warnings on cigarette packages , a popular preoccupation with physical fitness and restrictions on smoking in many restaurants and offices do not make business easy for industry executives . It comes as no surprise , then , that tobacco makers are aggressively diversifying . Philip Morris and R.J. Reynolds , which together account for 67% of total industry sales , have recently made major nontobacco takeovers . In June Reynolds agreed to buy Nabisco Brands , which makes scores of food products , including Oreo cookies and Ritz crackers . Three months later , Philip Morris announced that it would acquire General Foods , one of the largest U.S. food companies and a producer of such goods as Maxwell House coffee and Jell-O . <P> The most visible trouble for the industry comes from about 40 product-liability suits in which cigarette manufacturers are charged with causing disease and , in some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 1950s , and tobacco firms have always defeated any claims . This week in Santa Barbara County , Calif. , Superior Court , a case comes to trial . R.J. Reynolds is the sole cigarette manufacturer named in the lawsuit , but tobacco makers are closely following the case . Says Robert Rukeyser , vice president of American Brands , maker of Lucky Strike and Pall Mall : " We take these suits very seriously . We 're not complacent . " Echoes Aaron Twerski , a law professor at Hofstra University : " The whole world is watching . " <P> The Santa Barbara trial is certain to be a courtroom drama . The case involves John Galbraith , a former insurance company administrator who for 50 years smoked two to three packs of cigarettes a day . In 1982 Galbraith died , at 69 . The official cause of death was heart disease and emphysema . He spent the last years of his life hooked up to an oxygen machine . According to his family 's lawyers , Galbraith was once found removing the mask in order to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children are suing R.J. Reynolds for making a defective product .
