One answer might be that Mr. Koch managed to offend such a wide variety of groups. // He angered blacks , Jews , national Democratic figures , New Yorkers of multifarious persuasions concerned about race relations - including the highest-ranking black official in his administration , Police Commissioner Benjamin Ward . So intense did things get that the Mayor felt compelled to issue an explanation of his behavior in a lengthy letter to The New York Times that appeared yesterday. // Mr. Koch acknowledged that he upset people with what he had done , but he also upset them with what he had not done . Given a national forum , a chance to dramatize the problems of urban America , to talk about housing , the homeless , drug abuse and education , he chose to do none of that. // Instead , he criticized Mr. Jackson on foreign affairs , defense and the Federal budget. // To focus on Mr. Jackson was to irritate New York ' s already frayed race relations unnecessarily , critics and Koch loyalists have agreed . In a city that has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' s relentless focus on Mr. Jackson came across as the exact opposite of the healing that many people , black and white , want now in New York. // The Mayor suggested during the primary that Mr. Jackson should be treated like any other candidate . Whether intended or not , however , Mr. Koch singled out Mr. Jackson for criticism , and also ignored his special role this year . Mr. Jackson represents more than his formal stands on issues and Mr. Koch was doing more than criticizing a candidate , many politicians believe . He was pounding away at a man who had become an emotional symbol to blacks and other minority groups. // The Mayor set things off at the very beginning of the primary campaign by saying that " Jews and other supporters of Israel would have to be crazy " to vote for Mr. Jackson . Emphasizing the Jackson stand on Israel made Mr. Koch sound like a self-appointed spokesman for New York City ' s Jews , several critics , some of them Jewish , argued. // " I said , ' Ed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ re not reaching Jews , ' " said one Koch adviser . " But he wouldn ' t listen. " // Some Jewish voters , interviewed at the polls , praised the Mayor for raising the issue . Many others contended that his tactic offended many Jews and may have worsened relations between blacks and Jews , that it made it seem as if Jews care only about Israel . <> <> Questioned Jackson ' s Character // Most infuriating to those angry with Mr. Koch was his attack on Mr. Jackson two days before the primary. // Appearing on a national television program , he questioned Mr. Jackson ' s character by discussing how he behaved 20 years ago when the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. , was assassinated . Critics asked what purpose was served by rehashing an incident from two decades ago. // Mr. Koch has defended himself by saying that he had to speak out because nobody else was saying much about Mr. Jackson ' s record , or saying much of great content about anything , for that matter. // In fact , the Mayor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the campaign and the neutrality of the other leading Democrat in New York , Governor Cuomo . <> <> Acting as ' Paul Revere ' // The Mayor told friends , distressed by his behavior , that he was compelled by everybody else ' s silence to be the " Paul Revere , " warning everybody of the impending danger in the Jackson candidacy . One troubled mayoral adviser said that above all , Mr. Koch , who loves publicity , could not stop himself from grabbing center stage . And a national stage at that. // But nothing Mr. Koch said was new . Clearly , the other Democratic candidates chose not to take that route , not to alienate Mr. Jackson ; he will come to the Democratic convention with a large number of delegates , and candidates as well as Democratic leaders saw no reason to alienate him when they will need his cooperation at the convention in July. // Mr. Koch rejected that approach and chose to stir things up , which , he argues , is his obligation and his right . He has always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right to speak his mind. // His well-known propensity for doing just that has been the most blatant feature of his mayoralty , and another reason , perhaps , for the strong reaction against him of late . His many victims are in a position now to return the favor , and seem to be enjoying their chance . <> <> Insulting and Embarrassing // Since he took office in 1978 , Mr. Koch has taken pride in speaking his mind - even when it meant insulting and embarrassing others . That did not make for fast friends. // When he stumbled as badly as he has in the last few weeks , he had little good will left to draw on . If anything , he gave his long list of targets an excuse to attack back. // Whether Mr. Koch will be able to bounce back this time is not clear . He certainly has before . For years - even through the corruption scandals of his third term - he has been called the Teflon Mayor . Mr. Cuomo just last week said the Mayor was made of " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helped himself with some of his voters by giving voice to their own fears . <> <> Lengthy Letter // But there are now some elected officials who are predicting that despite the severe difficulties of beating an incumbent , the Presidential primary will be to Mr. Koch what the fiscal crisis was to former Mayor Abraham D. Beame : the factor that finally costs him his job. // Sensing what he had done to himself , the Mayor wrote his letter to The Times . The letter laid out the Mayor ' s position on what he said about Mr. Jackson , it included some lines that sounded apologetic , others that did not. // " My opposition to Jesse Jackson was based on his policy positions and record , " Mr. Koch said in the letter . At another point he wrote , " I regret that my opposition and my voice sounded strident. " // Commissioner Ward , who on Tuesday took the Mayor to task and said he should apologize , said yesterday that he was " absolutely " satisfied with Mr. Koch ' s explanation and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Clearing the Air ' // Others are less forgiving . " I likened that alleged apology to the youth who murdered his mother and father and then pleaded for mercy because he was an orphan , " said a Jackson supporter , Barry Feinstein , the head of the local International Brotherhood of Teamsters union and one of those seeking a coalition candidate to run against Mr. Koch. // The Mayor ' s confidants are convinced that he has no regrets and wrote the letter only as a tactic aimed at quieting things down , at " clearing the air , " as one adviser put it. // Maybe it has . But then again , faced with enemies , critics and disaffected allies from past episodes , maybe it has not. //
