Eastern and Texas Air responded quickly by expressing confidence that the merger could be completed under revised terms. // Until indications in the past few days of governmental misgivings , analysts had expected approval of the merger , which would create the nation ' s largest airline company , with annual revenues of $6. 7 billion , slightly larger than United Air Lines Inc . Eastern is the nation ' s third-largest airline and Texas Air is No. 7 . <> <> Analysts Remain Optimistic // In July , the Justice Department said it expected to support the $676 million purchase . Today analysts remained optimistic that the merger would take place . Candace Browning , an airline analyst with Oppenheimer &; Company , said : " Texas Air still very much does want to own Eastern . The most likely scenario is that the deal goes through. " // The Transportation Department ' s action marked the fourth rejection of a large corporate merger in recent weeks by the Reagan Administration and raised the question of whether the White House was tightening up on its enforcement of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shuttle routes . New York Airlines Inc. , a subsidiary of Texas Air , also operates shuttle services , which have La Guardia Airport as the hub between Boston and Washington. // With Eastern and New York Air linked in common ownership , analysts expected that Texas Air would phase out New York Air ' s shuttle operations. // To alleviate antitrust worries , Texas Air agreed to give up some shuttle properties , selling them to a newcomer , Pan American World Airways , which plans to begin shuttle service on Oct. 1 , in competition with Eastern. // Texas Air agreed to sell Pan Am 12 takeoff and landing slots to Boston and Washington , as well as several extra passenger gates at La Guardia. // But the Government said it was concerned that Pan Am would have too few landing and takeoff slots to compete . Without Pan Am acquiring more slots in peak hours , it indicated , the agreement was unacceptable. // The difference between the current agreement and what appears to be acceptable to the Government is only three takeoff and landing slots during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three more peak time slots at La Guardia to Pan Am , it would bring Pan Am ' s total to 15 daily roundtrips from La Guardia to both Boston ' s Logan International Airport and the Washington National Airport . <> <> Boost for Pan Am Seen // Analysts said the competitive difference of those slots would be significant . They added that the extra three slots could give Pan Am a significant boost in its attempt to compete with Eastern ' s shuttle operations , especially since peak-time flights are often far more profitable than off-peak flights. // " Effective competition requires hourly service , especially at peak hours , and Pan American would not have enough slots at La Guardia to operate hourly service , " the Transportation Department said. // Eastern ' s shuttle operations , often referred to as its " crown jewel , " have been the most profitable by far for the troubled carrier .

" We are amazed at this order , which strains credibility , " the company said in a statement reflecting the aggressiveness of its chairman , Frank A. Lorenzo . <> <> Republic Merger Cited // The company noted that earlier in the year the Transportation Department had approved a merger between Republic Air Lines and Northwest Airlines over the objections of the Justice Department ' s antitrust division , and that it had rejected the Texas Air-Eastern transaction despite the approval by the Justice Department. // The action today also appeared to reflect a growing concern on the part of the Reagan Administration with the wave of mergers between companies that command large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ potential reduction in competition , the Federal Trade Commission rejected proposed mergers between the Coca-Cola Company and the Dr Pepper Company and between Pepsico Inc. and the Seven-Up Company . Some antitrust attorneys predicted then that the Administration would have to approve the next big merger to avoid confusing the business community. // Last month , however , the Interstate Commerce Commission told the Santa Fe Railroad that it could not complete its acquisition of the Southern Pacific Railroad. // Antitrust experts have said that such merger rejections do not necessarily reflect an Administration backing away from liberal interpretations of antitrust rules , but rather an Administration having to confront blatantly anticompetitive mergers. // Pan Am said today that the announcement would not affect its plans to proceed with a Northeast corridor shuttle operation , based at La Guardia Airport . " Pan Am ' s agreement with Texas Air to purchase gates and slots was not contingent on Department of Transporation approval of the acquisition , " said Merle Richman , director of public relations at Pan Am. // Mr. Richman added that Pan Am had leased eight aircraft for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 12 roundtrip flights a day both to Washington and Boston . " The airline is also working on building its own shuttle facility at La Guardia ' s Marine Air Terminal. // But some pilots and analysts have said that Pan Am is running into troubles with its plans to start up its shuttle operation by Oct. 1 . They note that construction at the terminal is behind schedule and that gates sold to Pan Am by Texas Air are unsuitable for shuttle service. //
