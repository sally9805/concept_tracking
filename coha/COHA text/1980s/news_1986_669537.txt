But now she has fallen into a second predicament , all too common in her adopted land : She has become a single parent . With no job and limited English , she must depend on a $472 welfare check every month to support herself , her five-year-old son , and her nine-month-old daughter. // ' ' It ' s very hard to be a single mother , ' ' Ms. Suarez says . ' ' Money is much problem . Even though the government helps with food for the children , sometimes I don ' t eat. ' ' // // Part of the difficulty , she explains , speaking alternately in English and Spanish , is the $300 she must pay for a single room - no kitchen , no bath - in an old hotel occupied by welfare recipients . ' ' The landlord charge too much - $100 a person. ' ' // ' ' I ' m very worried about my children growing up in that environment , ' ' Ms. Suarez continues , tears filling her dark eyes and spilling down her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He wants to play . He ' s growing up . I feel sometimes I can ' t go through one more day . I want something better for my children. ' ' // As a former secretary with training in electronics , Suarez hopes eventually to find employment and become self-sufficient . But her current economic plight is all too typical . More than 1 child in 5 now lives in a family below the poverty line , which is defined as an income of $10 , 990 for a family of four . Forty percent of Hispanic children live in poverty , as do 43 percent of black children . Children make up the fastest-growing group of impoverished people in the country. // ' ' Children are in the absolute worst status they have been in during my 30 years of monitoring child and family life in this country , ' ' says Edward Zigler , director of the Bush Center in Child Development and Social Policy at Yale University . ' ' Every day more and more children are slipping into poverty , which immediately puts them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // That poverty has many causes . Some of it stems from a rising tide of immigrants , who now account for about 40 percent of population growth nationwide . A far greater proportion of childhood poverty can be traced to increases in the numbers of female-headed households . More than half of the 12 million children who live in families headed by women are living in poverty . Although a Stanford researcher reports that the feminization of poverty decreased between 1979 and 1984 , a family headed by a woman is 4 times as likely to be poor as a family that includes a married couple or one headed by a man. // From California to New York , the sad consequence is the same . ' ' Children are poor mostly because their mothers are poor , ' ' says Theresa Funiciello , co-director of Social Agenda , an antipoverty group in New York . And the mothers become poor by having children. // Two profound sociological changes have contributed to this Catch-22 situation . One is the American divorce rate , now around 50 percent . Ten million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year , that figure will have increased by 1 million . Formerly middle-class women moving toward the edge of poverty constitute a substantial part of a growing minority dubbed the ' ' new poor . ' ' Less than 15 percent of divorced and separated women receive alimony , and default rates are high on child-support payments. // As a result , one-third of divorced women with children move into poverty . In addition , pregnancies among unmarried women have reached record levels . Twenty-one percent of all babies in the US are now born out of wedlock. // As the proportion of children living in poverty has increased - it is up by more than 50 percent in the last 15 years - many children ' s rights supporters worry that children ' s priority on the national agenda is declining . They point out that federal funds for day-care assistance have been cut by 25 percent since 1980 . And the proportion of poor children receiving Aid to Families with Dependent Children ( AFDC ) benefits dropped between 1978 and 1984. // ' ' The most important issue to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' ' says Jim Lardie , executive director of the Association of Child Advocates , in Cleveland . ' ' But it ' s not popular . It ' s very difficult talking about issues like that to policymakers when the majority of people in this country are quite comfortable. ' ' // Harold Howe II , a senior lecturer at the Graduate School of Education at Harvard and former education commissioner under President Johnson , agrees , citing ' ' a change in our view of government . In the ' 60s and partly into the ' 70s , many people regarded these social problems of poverty and unemployment as problems to which the national government ought to give real attention and do something about . That belief has declined . There is also a feeling on the part of some people that the civil rights movement in the United States has largely been successful , and now we don ' t need to worry so much about blacks , Hispanics , and other folks who were on the bottom of the pile and kept there by legal means. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the least fortunate people are mostly black and Hispanic . They are not . The least fortunate people are mostly white . But that misapprehension feeds right into a still-alive racial prejudice that exists in this society . That tends to encourage a do-nothingness about social programs . We ' re in kind of a bind , and we need some new leadership. ' ' // Across the Golden Gate Bridge , a half-hour drive from Cecilia Suarez , Linda Pratt lives with her two children , aged 6 and 3 , in the tiny black community of Marin City in a housing project that stands as an exception to the wealth of Marin County , where the average household income is $57 , 810 . The attractive two-story town houses and five-story apartments hugging the foothills bear no resemblance to stark inner-city housing projects . But the challenges residents face are the same : teen-age pregnancy , drugs , poverty , despair. // Mrs. Pratt , whose husband is serving a prison sentence , is a parent-involvement coordinator with Head Start in Marin County , as well as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the women she works with feel : // ' ' Being on AFDC is really stressful . You don ' t get that much money . The women are lacking in self-esteem . It ' s real hard to be so needy and see so much wealth around them. // ' ' Housing is another problem . There are a lot of people living together . That just adds to the stress . When you live in an area like this , it ' s easy to stay in a cycle . It ' s hard for people to move up . If there was housing somewhere else , that might help by just getting you physically out of the situation . Also , a lot of women who are single are always looking for the right guy . They have their kids and they ' re looking for a boyfriend , but it just doesn ' t work together. ' ' // Many of these young mothers , she observes , find ' ' very little pleasure ' ' in child rearing . ' ' Maybe there ' s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I just don ' t get the sense people are having a good time being a parent . They ' re young , single , and they don ' t have enough information to be good parents . You have to have training to become a janitor , but you don ' t have to have training to become a parent . I think it should be mandatory in schools. ' ' // As for the children , she says , ' ' A lot of kids need to know their parents care about them and how they do in school . Children just need more support from home , more of home and school working together . Most of all they need to feel good about themselves. ' ' // Sitting in the living room of her sunny apartment , surrounded by plants , toys , and books on Asian art , Pratt says quietly , ' ' I feel good about my own children . I hope they don ' t get stuck here . I hope they ' ll be happy and don ' t get into other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is how things look to Cecilia Suarez and Linda Pratt , two women on the inside hoping , with their children , to break out of poverty in the richest country in the world . If anything , the view from the outside appears even more sobering , as seen by the professionals . Theresa Funiciello puts it bluntly : ' ' Poverty is the No. 1 killer of children in the United States . It ' s murder by malfeasance . Nobody is seeing any blood . ' ' This kind of ' ' murder , ' ' she points out , can take many forms , including lead-paint poisoning , elevator-shaft deaths , apartment fires , and ' ' failure to thrive , for which the only medicine is food. ' ' // Ms. Funiciello says she ' ' became just amazed by the number of poor women who said they lost a child . I realized this was not normal . ' ' Her curiosity piqued , she began examining fatal-fire data in New York City . She counted 23 fatal fires in a poor neighborhood of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ none in a wealthy neighborhood. // Nor is the problem confined to ghettos or minority groups . In Maine , a state that is 98 percent white and largely rural , a 1980 study found that 12 times as many poor children died in house fires as non-poor children , and eight times as many of disease. // Apart from the obvious solution - more money - what can be done to prevent the perpetuation of poverty and the establishment of a permanent underclass of poor children ? First of all , specialists say , the crisis must be recognized . Mr. Lardie , in Cleveland , notes that this summer ' s Hands Across America project was ' ' a very noble kind of immediate , symbolic act that caused a lot of people to think momentarily about poverty . ' ' But , he adds , ' ' the country has to think of it much more frequently than that . If we ' re going to deal with poverty , we have to deal with it as an issue of justice and fairness , not as an issue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a national solution. ' ' // Next , child advocates note , the cycle of poor children bearing more poor children of their own must be interrupted at the source by education , by moral suasion - by every means available . ' ' We have a grave societal problem , the out-of-control fertility of the impoverished and disadvantaged , ' ' says Wesley Jenkins , director of the Family Service Centers in Clearwater , Fla . ' ' Sex is one of the things in our society that is still free . You ' re never going to defeat poverty until you curb that excess fertility of the impoverished . We must control it or it will engulf us. ' ' // Third , they say , a way must be found to keep poor families - especially the children - from feeling like an island apart , broken off from the mainland. // ' ' For poor families that grow up with no attachment to the labor force , no attachment to anything but the welfare system , you have to do something early with kids to show them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that ' s a good thing , ' ' says Harold Richman , director of the Chapin Hall Center for Children at the University of Chicago. // ' ' We ought to have huge opportunities for kids to participate in constructive service projects in the community . They should be well organized , well rewarded , a lot of fun . Whether it ' s a combination of a recreational program and a work program , whether you ' re painting a school or supervising the park or helping old people go to the store , there is a sense of dignity in doing that . If you start kids early enough , the cynical attitude they develop later can be at least a little diluted . There has to be a sense in which kids can be contributors and be recognized for that. // ' ' If a kid has a stake in nothing , he ' s not going to do anything . That ' s why gangs are so attractive . They ' re a different kind of voluntary association . There ' s a need for that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get it one way you ' ll get it another. ' ' // Finally , observers say , if the poor must find their way into the outside world , the outside world must find its way into theirs . One program in Fairfax , Calif. , called Campaign for a Healthier Community for Children , seeks to get local businesses and agencies to be more responsive to the needs of children. // ' ' The whole community must realize children are our responsibility , ' ' says Ethel Seiderman , director of the Fairfax-San Anselmo Children ' s Centers in Fairfax . ' ' Right now the climate in our nation is not an enhancing climate . So the community is going to have to move in on behalf of children . We are our brother ' s keeper , not by taking over his life , but by helping and enhancing it. ' ' // //
