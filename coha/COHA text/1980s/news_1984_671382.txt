He had gone to Mexico , it was later learned , to try to recover from the strain of too much success . He was back in a recording studio after three months , primarily to honor a recording contract on which he still owed a few records . He brought with him a big string section and some woodwinds , unusual instrumentation for a swing band in 1940 , along with a song he had found in Mexico , " Frenesi . " The resultant record relaunched his career just as " Begin the Beguine , " had started him the first time , and he was on the treadmill of success once again. // From then on , there was a running battle between Mr. Shaw ' s annoyance with the music business and his desire to do something different . For the opening in 1949 of Bop City , a big jazz club on Broadway just off Times Square , he formed a 40-piece symphonic orchestra to play strict classical programs on a bill that included Ella Fitzgerald and Kai Winding ' s Sextet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jazz fans in the audience cried out for mercy : " Let ' s Jump !

But , as Mr. Shaw continued on into the early 1950 ' s , he found that he was at odds not only with the commercial aspects of the music business , but with many of his old fans as well. // // // Unlike his band-leading peers in the Swing Era - Tommy Dorsey , Benny Goodman , Glenn Miller - Mr. Shaw was stimulated by the new jazz called be-bop that cropped up in the 1940 ' s . He began incorporating bop musicians in his band ( Dodo Marmarosa was his pianist as early as 1944 , and he used arrangements by Tadd Dameron and George Russell ) . His own clarinet playing became colored with bop ideas . His old fans , like most swing band fans , resented bebop and were not prepared to accept his new approaches . Neither were the record companies .

" // This evidence of Artie Shaw ' s direction when he left music in 1954 had never been released until the Book-of-the-Month Club recently brought the records out as part of a new four-disk set , " Artie Shaw : A Legacy " ( by mail from Book-of-the-Month Records , Camp Hill , Pa. 17012 , $27. 95 plus $1. 75 shipping and handling ; residents of New York and Pennsylvania add local sales tax ) . The set includes Mr. Shaw ' s performance with a string quartet and rhythm section at a jazz concert in 1936 that led to his debut as a band leader , as well as three appearances with classical groups and one with Paul Whiteman ' s Orchestra , all issued now for the first time. // // // Thus , in one album , we have both the beginning and the end of Mr. Shaw ' s career as a leader . In 1936 , Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a sideman for radio and recordings , when Joe Helbock , the owner of the Onyx , a hangout for jazz musicians on 52d Street , had the then novel idea of putting on a swing concert at the Imperial Theater . Mr. Shaw , asked to join in a program that included Glen Gray ' s Casa Loma Orchestra and Bob Crosby ' s big band as well as small combos with Bunny Berrigan , Joe Bushkin and the guitarist Carl Kress , put together a seven-piece group - a string quartet with drums , guitar and his own clarinet - for which he wrote a single piece , " Interlude in B-flat . " It was the hit of the concert and , as a consequence , within four months Mr. Shaw was leading his first big band at the Hotel Lexington - a swing band built around a swing quartet. // Today " Interlude in B-flat " is little more than a curiosity - the cushion of strings under a jazz horn has become commonplace during the ensuing 50 years . But even so , the distinctive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lines , later to be heard flowing warmly through the setting of a big band or cutting through the sharper edges of his Gramercy Five , creates an unusual conjunction with even the limited use of strings that he tried in 1936. // The bulk of the set is given over to the Gramercy Five Recordings he made in 1954 - they take up five of the eight sides . For the most part they are either small group versions of his big band arrangements - " Begin the Beguine , " " Dancing in the Dark , " " Back Bay Shuffle , " " Frenesi " - or new versions of such old small-group successes as " Cross Your Heart , " " Summit Ridge Drive , " and " The Sad Sack .

But when they are working with the early big band tunes , the sound and character of the original arrangements still color their playing , even though only the opening and closing choruses actually follow the originals. // Listening to these 1954 Gramercy Five sides suggests that Mr. Shaw quit just a little too soon . A new kind of combo jazz was just coming into being then . The Gerry Mulligan Quartet and the Modern Jazz Quartet were taking their first steps .
