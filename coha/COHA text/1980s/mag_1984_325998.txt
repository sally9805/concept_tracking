Reagan hands out election-year goodies to key voters <P> Between high interest rates and falling land prices , many farmers are in serious trouble , suffocating in a credit squeeze . <P> So what is the presidential candidate 's solution ? <P> During a campaign trip to rural Iowa , he outlined " a major initiative to assist farmers trying to cope with debt burdens . " It was an emergency aid scheme of the kind Democrats are wont to suggest , involving a stretched-out repayment schedule for Government loans and federal guarantees of private credit . The package could cost as much as $1.3 billion . <P> And what does the candidate propose to do about high unemployment among steelworkers ? He announced a plan to negotiate with foreign governments for a 30% reduction in the amount of low-cost steel exported to the U.S. <P> Such special-interest sops are just the kinds of Government interference in the free market that Ronald Reagan has spent his political career decrying-and condemns nowadays when they are advocated by Walter Mondale . Yet last week it was the Republican President , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for agriculture and steel . <P> Those election-season announcements showed the kind of political leverage that comes with incumbency . Mondale can only talk ; the President can do . Indeed , Reagan exploits the political powers of the White House at least as well as any predecessor . He showed last week that it is more than a matter of handing out goodies to farmers and Big Steel . Whether in an Iowa field , on a street in Hammonton , N.J. , or on the Waterbury , Conn. , town green , he was highly visible but almost invulnerable . His handlers continue to limit his contact with insistent journalists and give him vague , breezy speeches to deliver to friendly crowds . His upbeat rhetoric in Waterbury was quintessential Reagan : " We say America should shoot for the stars , strive for the best and , like our Olympic athletes , go for it . " The strategy seemed clear : keep people smiling , and avoid potentially unbecoming wrangling with Mondale on matters of substance . <P> Reagan disclaimed any political motivation for his farm package @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . are going to believe this , " he told reporters . " It was n't done with that in mind . It was done because there are people out there who need help . " Reagan instructed the Farmers Home Administration , the federal lender for growers and ranchers who can not get private credit , to permit many distressed farmers extra time to pay back their loans : debtors can arrange for as much as 25% ( up to $100,000 ) of outstanding principal and interest payments to be postponed for as long as five years , without penalty . Furthermore , the Government will guarantee local banks ' outstanding loans to farmers if the bank will simply forgive 10% of the debt . Cost to the Treasury : at least $1 billion . <P> Although Reagan 's steel-import restriction plan does not involve direct Government expenditures , it will be costly : consumers will pay billions more for everything from automobiles to canned goods . Moreover , it may be a significant Administration nod toward protectionist trade policy ( see ECONOMY &; BUSINESS ) .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
