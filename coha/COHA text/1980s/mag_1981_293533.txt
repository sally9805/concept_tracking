' Silver Saddle , Gopher Gulch and Wild Wild West . The sound of their music is country , and the cut of their outfit is cowboy . Country-and-western nightclubs are riding high . In towns and cities from New Paltz , N.Y. , to Carmichael , Calif. , and North to South , there are now countless sagebrush saloons , corralling urban buckaroos with lively rustic dancing , good ole buddydom and a frontier atmosphere that may owe more to hype than history but is infectious nonetheless . Only a year ago , many of the new spots were disco clubs , whose stylized allure has faded fast in some locales . Now . decked out with steer horns , long bars , and waitresses in Stetsons and hot jeans , they have struck a bonanza . <P> They also strike close to the durable American dream of macho @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cowgirl as valiant pardner . Several hundred western-style watering holes feature bucking mechanical bulls on which patrons of both sexes risk serious damage to body and ego ( see box ) . A spot called Outlaws , formerly a mud-wrestling disco outside Chicago , provides roisterers ( for $2 a pair ) with Harrington &; Richardson .22-cal. western-style revolvers and nine blank rounds for mock shootouts . At some places , mostly for atmosphere , there are signs announcing NO GUNS , NO KNIVES . NO TIES . For down-the-hatch topers , Chicago 's Rodeo offers a selection of booze that includes Redeye whisky , Rotgut Scotch , Panther gin and Snakebite vodka ; Rodeo also claims to be the city 's largest Budweiser outlet after Wrigley Field .
