When Nelson Mandela turned 70 last month , his visitors were surprised at how remarkably fit the black nationalist leader looked . Under the rigid discipline he has imposed on himself during the quarter-century he has been imprisoned on a life sentence for sabotage , he rose every morning before dawn for a two-hour workout . But four weeks ago , Mandela suddenly became short of breath . He had difficulty talking , then started coughing up blood . He was transferred from the medical wing of Pollsmoor Prison to Tygerberg Hospital , a major university teaching institution on the other side of Cape Town . Last week Mandela 's lawyer announced the diagnosis : tuberculosis . <P> A highly contagious disease whose symptoms can frequently be ambiguous , tuberculosis is endemic in South Africa . Mandela might have inhaled the TB bacillus in prison and developed the disease immediately , though it is more likely to have lain quiescent in his body for years . Doctors drained three liters of fluid from around his left lung and prescribed antibiotics . Mandela , hospital officials say , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the encouraging prognosis of full recovery . <P> No one is more determined that Mandela should get the finest medical care than South Africa 's highest officials , who fear that he might die in jail and set off an explosion of violent protest in the country 's black townships . Justice Minister Kobie Coetsee , who oversees the prison system , made a point of visiting Mandela at Tygerberg . Minister of Health Willem van Niekerk sent regular bulletins from the doctors to State President P.W . Botha . In reply to a worried letter from the Rev. Frank Chikane , general secretary of the South African Council of Churches , Botha assured him , " We are even more concerned and do wish Mr. Mandela a speedy recovery . " Botha added that the patient had said he was satisfied with the treatment he was receiving and had not asked to be examined by outside doctors , as Chikane and Mandela 's wife Winnie had requested . <P> Mandela 's illness triggered fresh demands from around the world for his release . Botha knows if Mandela dies an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other hand , his release might be greeted by an uncontrollable uprising of millions of black South Africans for whom he is the leading symbol of resistance to the apartheid system . Last week Botha renewed his long-standing offer to free Mandela if he would publicly renounce the use of violence for political ends  --  a bargain Mandela has repeatedly refused on the grounds that prisoners can not make deals . <P> Addressing a congress of the ruling National Party in Durban , Botha said he did not think Mandela should " choose to go back to prison " and that he hoped Mandela " will make it possible for me to act in a humane way . " That meant , he said , that he was prepared to release Mandela if he would reject political violence and pledge not to support those who use it .
