But remember , these are the 1980s , not the boomy days of the ' 70s . There are more ways to make a real estate play , but the spectacular appreciation of the last decade is past. // Inflation , the locomotive pulling prices up , has slowed . The average price of a new home in December was $91 , 000 , showing a rise in price of only 6. 6 percent over 1982 , keeping just ahead of inflation. // ' ' Single-family homes and condominiums are likely to keep pace with inflation , ' ' says Leanne Lachman , president of Real Estate Research Corporation . ' ' But if inflation rises dramatically , appreciation probably won ' t keep up . ' ' With $90 , 000-plus sales tags and high interest rates already taking millions of potential home buyers out of the picture , the market would not bear steep price increases. // Nonetheless , buying a home is the first real estate investment you should make , if only to reap the tax benefits from deducting mortgage interest and property taxes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cliche , but this is the time to buy . ' ' It ' s likely interest rates will rise over the next three years , ' ' says Ms. Lachman of the Chicago-based national consulting firm . ' ' But don ' t buy the biggest house you can afford . Buy the best size for your needs . ' ' Because of the affordability problem , ' ' The larger homes are appreciating slower than the smaller ones , ' ' she notes. // If you already have a home , there are plenty of other options . As an investment , a second home is not recommended . There are better returns available elsewhere. // Ms. Lachman lists her real estate investment preferences in order of safety : // 1 . Government National Mortgage Association ( Ginnie Mae ) securities. // 2 . Real estate investment trusts ( REITs ) . // 3 . Stock in home-building companies. // 4 . Syndicates or limited partnerships. // 5 . Apartment or retail property. // The top three on her list offer income but few tax benefits . They ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The younger person , in peak earning years , is looking for tax advantages , ' ' says Christopher P. Jones , president of Multi-Service Financial Planning. // Ginnie Maes : A favorite with institutional investors for the last five years , they are now widely available to individuals . When you buy Ginnie Mae shares , you are buying into a pool of mortgages . The principal and interest are guaranteed by the Government National Mortgage Association. // Returns on Ginnie Maes are slightly higher than bonds , Ms. Lachman says . ' ' In fact , they work like a bond but they have real estate behind them. ' ' // There are some risks if you buy the higher-yield Ginnie Mae bonds that sell above face value , as Jay Rabinowitz , vice-president of Merrill Lynch ' s financial planning department , points out : // ' ' Unlike a bond , if interest rates drop and there is a rush among homeowners to refinance , then the notes may come due sooner than you expect . You may get back only the face value of the certificate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discounted Ginnie Maes with lower yields . The minimum face value is $25 , 000 and yields currently fall in the 11 to 14 percent range. // REITs : Ms. Lachman is bullish on REITs . ' ' They are very , very solid . In most cases , they ' re undervalued in the stock market . ' ' REITs are publicly held companies , and are similar to mutual funds . Most trusts invest in either property or mortgages and distribute income as dividends. // REITs took a severe tumble in the mid- ' 70s recession but in the last four or five years have regained respectability. // Another plus , says Ms. Lachman , is that REITs are often taken private and the shares are bought back from the outside investors , usually at a nice profit . If you buy into a REIT now , she says , ' ' you stand a reasonably good chance of its being purchased to go private. ' ' // Home-building companies : The third income-earning ' ' real estate ' ' option is a straight stock play . A close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . U.S. Home Corporation , the largest single-family home builder in the nation , is struggling in the overbuilt Houston area . A recent issue of Value Line Investment Survey mentions Centex Corporation and Ryland Group as timely picks. // Limited partnerships : In the past two years the popularity of syndicates or limited partnerships has skyrocketed . The money invested in public syndicates jumped from $2. 7 billion in 1982 to $4. 7 billion last year . An estimated $20 billion to $25 billion has gone into private syndicates. // In a private limited partnership , a small number of investors will pool their funds . The general partner will buy and manage the property and assume any liabilities beyond the limited partners ' investment . The payoff comes when you sell , and at tax time. // ' ' Over a 3- to 5-year period you might invest $10 , 000 a year , ' ' says Mr. Jones . ' ' Your tax benefit could be $23 , 000 the first year . ' ' But the Internal Revenue Service is watching syndicates closely . Investors should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their investment. // Public limited partnerships tend to have lower minimums ( $5 , 000 to $10 , 000 ) , reduced tax benefits , and less risk . ' ' They usually require just a one-time investment of say , $5 , 000 . And the deductions are gradual : perhaps $500 a year , ' ' Mr. Jones says. // Limited partnerships are ' ' a wonderful thing , ' ' says Ms. Lachman , but the money they ' re attracting also brings out fly-by-nighters. // ' ' You have got to do your homework on the track record of the company and the individual properties involved , ' ' she warns. // With so much competition now , there is a temptation to overbid on properties , thus jacking up the tax write-offs for investors . If the initial price is too high , the partnership runs the risk of selling the property for less than it paid for it . If so , the IRS may come knocking for a recapture payment. // Where are syndicates putting their money ? // Primarily in residential middle-income rental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ priced ( $400 to 700 a month ) garden apartments , ' ' says Jones. // Apartments and retail property : Since most private syndicates are focusing on large apartments complexes , Ms. Lachman sees an opening for investors in buildings with less than 25 units. // Her one caution : ' ' Real estate is management-intensive . It must be overseen on a day-to-day basis . People don ' t grasp how serious that is . ' ' If you don ' t have the time to manage it yourself , she recommends getting a willing partner or partners. // She also likes the looks of small retail storefronts . ' ' Retail supplies are in good balance now . They can be very attractive , but you must watch the tenants ' business carefully , ' ' she advises. // //
