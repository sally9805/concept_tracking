The dispute between IBM and Fujitsu , the most powerful Japanese firm in the mainframe-computer market , has been one of the biggest copyright battles ever . Last week arbitrators disclosed a settlement in the case , which began in 1982 when IBM accused Fujitsu of illegally copying Big Blue operating-system software to use in the Japanese manufacturer 's IBM-compatible machines . Based on a secret accord reached a year ago , Fujitsu is paying IBM $833 million for use of the software . Until 1997 , Fujitsu will also pay an annual fee that may reach $51 million next year . <P> Fujitsu will benefit by getting a limited look at IBM 's software , which some analysts consider a major concession by the U.S. company . But others see the settlement as an IBM victory . Says Jonathan Fram , a Bear Stearns analyst : " It 's a masterstroke by IBM because they got their main rival to admit that it stole from them .
