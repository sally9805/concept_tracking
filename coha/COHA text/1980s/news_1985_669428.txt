Placards prominently displayed in the windows of commercial banks , credit unions , and thrift institutions proclaimed that message only four years ago , when government tax laws first permitted employed individuals to open tax-free retirement accounts. // In smaller print , the seductive ads charted out the compound growth that the then-$1 , 500 per year IRA contributions would achieve at double-digit rates . The promise : That a 30-year-old opening an IRA would be catapulted to millionaire status by the time he was 65 , merely by continuing to make risk-free deposits at that institution. // // But those were the days when interest rates were stratospheric and five-year certificates of deposit were available in the 15 , 16 , and 17 percent range , and money market funds competed with slightly higher yields. // ' ' Many banks and S &; Ls were even offering outlandish rates like 18 percent and 20 percent for short periods as a come-on for IRA depositors , ' ' recalls Robert Thomas , executive vice-president and head of the retirement planning department at Advest , a Hartford , Conn. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IRA business. // Today the average investor is hard pressed to find yields at banks anywhere near their former appeal . And while some IRA depositors are continuing to use savings institutions , recalling with nostalgia the heady rates they once got , more and more are turning to alternatives. // Some are opting for brokerage houses , which make available a plethora of investment vehicles - zero coupon bonds , equities , mutual funds , and traditional bonds as well as certificates of deposit . Others are choosing families of mutual funds , thereby taking the burden of individual responsibility for making their retirement nest egg grow . Or diminish. // ' ' People are increasingly willing to take responsibility for their own financial affairs , ' ' says Larry Stupski , president and chief operating officer of Charles Schwab &; Co. , the San Francisco-based discount brokerage owned by Bank of America . Schwab claims over 100 , 000 IRA accounts . ' ' With the increased phenomenon of divorce and other social change , people are increasingly willing to concentrate on financial self-reliance , ' ' Mr. Stupski @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of IRA accounts at banks , thrifts , and savings and loan associations has been shrinking , while brokerage business IRA accounts have been on the increase . Last year the brokerage business accounted for 13. 6 percent of all IRA accounts , compared with 12. 5 percent the previous year. // Meanwhile , savings and loans ' share of IRA accounts slipped from 26. 3 percent in 1983 to 24. 8 percent in 1984 , and mutual savings banks ' portion dropped from 6. 3 percent to 5. 5 percent . Evidence indicates that the brokerage house and mutual fund portion of the IRA universe is growing even faster this year. // ' ' We have seen the number of IRA accounts triple in the past year , ' ' offers Glenn Sinischko , marketing manager for retirement planning at Cleveland-based brokerage house Prescott , Ball &; Turben . Mr. Sinischko attributes the growth to two factors : An increased sales effort by his firm , coupled with the fact that investors have accumulated anywhere from $8 , 000 to $10 , 000 in their IRA accounts and are looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In addition , says Advest ' s Thomas , the larger accounts enable investors to justify the $30 custodial fees that most brokerage houses and mutual fund families charge to administer IRAs. // Furthermore , says Donald Underwood , vice-president and manager for retirement plans at Merrill Lynch , Fenner &; Smith , ' ' a greater number of IRA investors are interested in equities than last year , because the stock market has been so nice since the beginning of the year . They are picking growth stocks or a mutual fund which has growth as its aim. ' ' // The most prevalent investment in IRA accounts over the past year , however , is zero coupon bonds , whether issued by corporations or by the United States Treasury and put in packages known as TIGRs or CATS . According to Mr. Underwood , the zero coupon vehicle is appealing to IRA accounts because of their low initial purchase price , and the fact that the interest can compound free in an IRA , while in a taxable account that interest would be taxed annually despite the fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bond matures. // Says Underwood : ' ' The whole concept is like the old government savings bond . People understand that there is a precise rate of return . You can invest $250 for 10 years and receive $1 , 000 at the end . ' ' Right now corporate zeros are yielding some 11. 70 percent. // Of course today ' s attractive yield can be tomorrow ' s dis appointment , should interest rates rise substantially over the next few years . But , notes Advest ' s Thomas , that is one of the big advantages of a self-directed IRA . ' ' If you feel you have made a mistake and want to change your mind , you have the flexibility to do it . You can reverse your decision at a brokerage house without paying a penalty , as you would on certain types of bank certificates . ' ' The only penalty the investor has for changing his investment at a brokerage house is the commission - which incidentally , is not tax deductible. // Flexibility can be a true boon to the IRA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For instance , continues Thomas , ' ' a lot of IRA money was put into zero coupon bonds with a 13. 5 percent yield last spring . Since rates have fallen significantly , investors got a very good gain on the principal . They may now think it is time to switch to equities , convertible bonds , or preferred stocks which might offer more potential for the future. ' ' // Investors who do a good job of managing their self-directed IRAs this way may be financially comfortable and happy at retirement time - whether 20 years down the road or five . But other investors who have taken the self-directed path may not find things so rosy. // Says Martin Greenburg , director of book publishing at Boardroom Books , who began diversifying his IRA accounts two years ago : ' ' My wife and I have not been so lucky . My $2 , 000 investment in a well-known fund is now worth $1 , 500 . My wife ' s is now worth $1 , 300 . It is a big loss of capital , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loss is meaningless since you can ' t get tax advantages. // ' ' So you have to take a ' ' Japanese view , ' ' he joked . ' ' What will this mean to me in 400cq years ? In a way , it is like playing with Monopoly money . You can play with it , but you don ' t use it. ' ' // But other investors with self-directed IRAs have fared better . ' ' I use two mutual funds , says Mara Slatkin , a copy editor and wife of a research scientist . ' ' One is a low-risk no-load fund , the other a higher risk . I found that the higher risk fund performed better and I have been using that one ever since. ' ' // As IRAs get larger , it is evident that investors will opt for even more choices . ' ' We are seeing investors building mini-portfolios , ' ' says Merrill Lynch ' s Underwood . ' ' People thought of it at first as a tax deduction . But they are beginning to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that should be diversified , and in the future that will become even more important.
