The Presidency <P> In this age of rancor , there is one political reconciliation that defies the national mood and grows stronger and deeper each year . A direct descendant of the elm tree that John Quincy Adams planted on the White House grounds in 1826 is now three years old and 14 ft. high , growing in the soil Thomas Jefferson had graded into a small hill back in 1807 to increase the beauty and privacy of the President 's residence . <P> Jefferson and John Adams , John Quincy Adams ' father , were fast friends when they helped found the Republic . Politics subsequently divided and embittered them , and only in their last decade did the two men engineer a reconciliation . Now there is a living symbol . <P> The other day White House Gardener Irvin Williams looked proudly at the youngster . " It grew 4 ft. this year , " he said , scanning the supple trunk that is planted about 12 ft. from the original Adams elm , which is weak and declining . The old tree was the tallest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hit by lightning in 1965 and lost one of its huge limbs . Another storm in 1976 battered the tree even more , and now decay has begun to eat at the 4-ft. trunk . Its leaves , once deep green and dense , are thinning . They have fallen for the winter , and the likelihood is that next spring they will not regain even this year 's reduced vigor . But the family will go on . <P> This new little elm is not the first progeny of the Adams elm . Some seedlings have been shipped back to the Adams family in Quincy , Mass. , and a few to Lady Bird Johnson in Texas . Four more have been planted in other parts of the White House grounds . Since the old tree has resisted aphids , locusts , Washington 's air pollution and even Dutch elm disease , there is great hope that the new trees will inherit its special immunity . One by one the other elms around the White House have succumbed . Eight have died since 1965 , and only 31 oldtimers still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tree family . Each spring he will take a few seeds from the old tree and start them out on a Maryland farm . After three years of growth , they will be transplanted to their permanent homes . None of the cousins will be so special as the one planted in March on the Jefferson mound . It has the classic vase shape of Ulmus americana . Its trunk is already 4-in. in diameter , and its upper branches in a couple of years will brush the lower limbs of the patriarch . It will be ready to stand vigil for another 150 years in the name of the Adams family on the ground that Jefferson ordered reshaped . <P> Williams believes the old Adams elm has only a few years left , although trees , like humans , fight hard to live on . " We can never be sure , " says Williams . " Elms do n't like to lose Limbs . They do not heal well . " And the giant has now lost half a dozen of its big branches .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
