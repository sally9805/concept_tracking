New research has verified what some investors have known all along : When a company changes its name , its stock is likely to rise . Jonathan Karpoff , a business professor at the University of Washington in Seattle says he had " a hard time believing a survey of investment analysts that concluded that a company ' s price-earnings ratio is affected by its name . " But when he and Graeme Rankine , a professor at the University of Arizona in Tucson studied 40 corporate name changes , they found " to our surprise , equity values seem to increase at the time of a name change , " Mr. Karpoff said . In addition , three professors at Dartmouth ' s Amos Tuck School of Business Administration recently concluded that on average , stock prices rose " an astonishing 2. 4% " solely because of name changes . The Tuck study involved 355 New York Stock Exchange companies that changed their names between 1961 and 1985 , and made adjustments for overall market movement and unrelated events that might affect the price . The Tuck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Portugal Inc . Studying the effects of a name change on stock prices is tougher than it sounds , the professors said . For one thing , it ' s hard to know when to measure the effect . The name change usually takes place on the date of the annual meeting , when shareholders approve it . But the plan for the name change is announced weeks before in a proxy statement or elsewhere . The Tuck group concluded the sharpest change occurred in the 10 days before the first story about the name change in The Wall Street Journal  --  " the day on which information about a name change became public , " the group said . Robert G. Hansen , an associate professor at Tuck and co-author of the study with Paul A. Argenti and Scott A. Neslin , said researchers felt " there was leakage prior to that day . " Messrs . Rankine and Karpoff studied the period just after the first printed reference to the change . Researchers noted there may be a number of other unrelated events that work along with a name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Karpoff-Rankine study started out with some 230 companies and eliminated all but 40 because of " confounding events . " For example , many companies adopted stock-depressing antitakeover provisions at the same time they changed their names . But the Tuck study attempted to eliminate the effects of such events ; using a complicated formula , the researchers analyzed 16 different types of name changes and factored out as many as 40 concurrent events . The Tuck professors concluded the biggest effects on stock prices occurred with companies adopting an acronym  --  such as Nabisco or Conoco  --  adding the name of a merger partner , or " simple truncation , " like the change from Ashland Oil &; Refining Co. to Ashland Oil Inc . Mr. Hansen said he believes the name changes affected stock movements because they were part of policy changes in a corporate strategy . " It sends some signal of commitment , " he said . Nevertheless , individual stock movements were ultimately unpredictable . For example , Arkansas Louisiana Gas Co. ' s stock price rose 12% when the name was changed to Arkla Inc. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just 5. 5% when it changed to Asarco Inc. in 1975 . Among those switching to initials , Standard Pressed Steel Co. rose 15% when it changed to STS Technologies Inc. in 1978 ; Edgarton , Germeshausen &; Grier Inc. ' s decision to become EG &; Inc. in 1966 preceded a 2. 5% fall in stock price . Mr. Karpoff admitted the " silly conclusion " from the study is that companies would do well to change their names on a frequent basis , " but it ' s one I don ' t want to say .
