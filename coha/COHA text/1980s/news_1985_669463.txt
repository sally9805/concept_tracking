The aim : perpetuation of Deng Xiaoping ' s modernization and ' ' open door ' ' programs into the next two generations of leaders. // // In a long-prepared move , 131 members of the Communist Party old guard - most of them veterans of Mao Tse-tung ' s revolutionary war of the 1930s and ' 40s - resigned from their positions on five ruling bodies of the party Monday . They did so to make way for younger , better-educated technocrats . A resignation letter from those leaving the party Central Committee stated bluntly that abolishing ' ' de facto lifelong tenure ' ' and ' ' rejuvenation ' ' were the main purposes of the mass departure. // Paramount leader Deng Xiaoping thus followed through on his blueprint to put in place not only the generation of leaders who will succeed him , but the generation he hopes will succeed them. // In the process he is also altering the Chinese ruling party and the leadership that administers the country . Self-consciously egalitarian , relatively uneducated old revolutionaries are being replaced by younger , college-educated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solutions and pragmatic economic programs. // Despite this change , the struggle continues over entrepreneurship , decentralized management control , profitmaking , resource allocation , investment , stock issuance , who goes to college , and a host of other issues unknown in most communist countries. // In the view of many China hands , the youth revolution is not a monolithic shift . Many young students remain reluctant to join the party . Most of the bright college graduates who do join support Mr. Deng ' s modernization program vigorously. // But younger leaders vary widely in their aims from province to province . Some remain loyal to the old , inefficient , but job-secure collectivist patterns , while others favor the riskier but ultimately more wealth-producing free-market shift that has been underway for the last six years. // This week ' s move caps what sinologist Merle Goldman calls a ' ' Chinese party housecleaning that ( Soviet leader Mikhail ) Gorbachev will find hard to match as he plans for his own party congress next February. ' ' // During the past six months the base of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ governor and regional party secretary has been replaced . Now the top of the pyramid is being put into the hands of new technocrats , mostly in their fifties. // ' ' Deng has put his people in place from the ground up , ' ' Professor Goldman said in an interview last week at Harvard ' s Fairbank Center for East Asian Research. // Of the 131 resignations announced this week the key ones are those of 10 members of the 24-member Politburo . One of these , Marshal Ye Jianying , was also a member of the powerful six-person standing committee of the Politburo. // On Wednesday , at an unusual special conference of 1 , 000 party leaders , replacements for the 10 resigning Politburo members , most of them expected to be younger , will be announced . They are likely to include 56-year-old Hu Qili , the rising star whom many specialists think will eventually replace party General Secretary Hu Yaobang ; 57-year-old Li Peng , the indefatigable Soviet-trained engineeer who is vice premier and heir-apparent to the premiership ; and 56-year-old Tian Jiyun , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a luncheon interview in Washington two weeks ago , a senior Chinese diplomat explained the way the transition to this third generation of Dengist leaders is supposed to take place . Already second-generation power is largely vested in such party Secretariat leaders as Hu Yaobang and his vigorous protege , Hu Qili ( no relation ) , and in the inner cabinet of the State Council under Premier Zhao . They make most day-to-day operating decisions. // Those two power centers operate under the broad guidance of Deng . He exercises control largely through the enormous respect he commands . His channels of power are the standing committee of the Politburo , his chairmanship of the Central Advisory Commission , and his chairmanship of the Central Military Affairs Commission , which commands the armed forces. // It ' s notable that many of the resigning elders are veterans of Mao ' s Red Army . Their departure helps create openings into which Deng can promote officers loyal to his plans. // Among those plans : demobilization of nearly one-fourth of the People ' s Liberation Army over the next two years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a source of resistance to Deng ' s program of cutting overstaffing // throughout China and to his ideological change in the direction of a free-market economy , putting loyal officers in key positions may help contain such resistance. // The larger party bodies that are the training grounds for political and managerial talent will be dramatically altered by this week ' s resignations and replacements . The resignations of 10 Politburo members were among 64 resignations of members and alternate members of the 344-member Central Committee . Also , 37 of the 162 members of the Central Advisory Commission and 30 of the 132 members of the Discipline Inspection Commission are being replaced. // After this week ' s youthward shift , both the ruling Politburo and its pivotal standing committee will still be run by a majority made up of older party leaders . But there is strong evidence that already ubiquitous administrators such as Hu Qili and Li Peng are being groomed to usher a new generation onto those bodies , perhaps at the next party congress two years from now. // Possibly the most fascinating subject raised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last found a method of accomplishing both ( 1 ) orderly leadership succession and ( 2 ) rejuvenation of a vast bureaucracy prone to inertia and corruption. // Multi-party democracies have an automatic system for leadership transition and for refreshing at least the upper segment of their bureaucracies . Communist states have generally lacked both , except for changes brought about by damaging purges or showcase trials. // Over the past decade Deng has engineered his multigenerational shift , while the Kremlin remained mired in its life tenure system of Politburo leadership . Making up for lost time , Soviet leader Gorbachev has replaced about 20 percent of the Soviet Union ' s local party leaders , adding to the 20 percent already turned out by his mentor Yuri Andropov. // // // //
