LUCY : THE BEGINNINGS OF HUMANKIND <P> by Donald C. Johanson and Maitland A. Edey ; Simon &; Schuster ; 409 pages <P> Time : Nov. 30 , 1974 . Scene : the bleached and arid Afar Triangle of Ethiopia . Nothing about the desert seemed auspicious . Yet Anthropologist Donald Johanson had a premonition that this would be no ordinary morning . Shortly afterward , his hunch was ratified . The day was not merely unusual ; it was epochal . <P> After cataloguing some fossils , Johanson introduced a colleague to a section labeled Locality 162 . They came across an arm bone , then other parts from the same creature . By happenstance , they had unearthed a find that would alter the accepted view of man 's origins . <P> Most anthropological theory is based upon fragmentary evidence : a femur here , an incisor there . But what Johanson found needed no jigsaw reconstruction . The collection of dozens of bones was literally the skeleton in Homo sapiens ' closet . Nicknamed Lucy ( because the Beatles ' song Lucy in the Sky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expedition 's camp ) , the original owner of the bones was not the most prepossessing of creatures . She stood about 3 ft. tall and had a head the size of a softball . But despite her size , Lucy turned out to be a colossus . Careful dating of her remains showed that she had antedated Homo sapiens ( who appeared 100,000 years ago ) by some 3.5 million years . More important , the evidence she left behind showed that she walked on two legs , not on all fours . Lucy clearly was not an ape . And while she might not have been human , she was on her way . <P> Given this finding , even the most stolid anthropologist could construct a story of suspense and revelation . But Johanson and Co-Author Maitland Edey are no standard scientists . Like polished mystery writers , they trace the many searches for origins and review the rivalries that have driven such scholarly sleuths as Louis , Mary and Richard Leakey . Since Johanson is driven by the same combination of curiosity , daring and egotism , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ objectivity . Johanson is convinced that he is now in sole possession of the truth about human roots-and perhaps he is . <P> According to the authors , Lucy ( Australopithecus afarensis ) is important not merely because of her age but because of her posture . Until now , it was believed that humanity 's ancestors developed large brains before they walked erect . Lucy shows that it was the other way around . <P> Why was she vertical ? Johanson speculates that it may all have had to do with the family . Upright , females ' hands were free to care for infants ; males could carry food . The roots of pair bonding were set ; the old pattern of annual random coupling was obsolete . This amalgam of nature and nurture brought an endless mating season , happier hominids and , of course , more children-the Darwinian key to survival . Lucy and Co. may have been smaller and weaker than many of the animals they encountered , but when it came to reproducing , they were champions . That , suggest the authors , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why their all-too-human descendants are upright citizens today . - By Peter Stoler
