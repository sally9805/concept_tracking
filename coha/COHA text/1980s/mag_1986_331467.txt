Only three years ago , Commodore International of West Chester , Pa. , was the hottest name in a hot game : home-computer sales . Its Commodore 64 was the Volkswagen of computers , a low-cost , dependable model that became the best- selling machine in the business . The company 's earnings reached a record $144 million in its fiscal year 1984 . <P> But when home-computer sales started to fizzle in late 1984 , Commodore quickly began to lose its sizzle . Last week the company reported that it lost $53.2 million in the fourth quarter of 1985 . That brought its total losses since June of 1984 to $206 million . During this grim period Commodore has piled up debts of $250 million , and it is now negotiating with creditors to postpone a Feb. 28 deadline for loan repayments . <P> At Commodore headquarters , though , hopes still run high . Chief Executive Marshall Smith , 56 , is convinced that his new , technologically impressive Amiga computer will become a winner and that the banks will give the company enough time to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be working on a deal to raise cash through a merger or joint venture with another firm . <P> On the surface , Commodore 's troubles seem to have started with the abrupt departure in January 1984 of President Jack Tramiel , who resigned after a dispute with Chairman Irving Gould and later became head of Atari , a rival home-computer maker . A savvy salesman and cutthroat competitor , Tramiel made Commodore a huge success by bringing out quality products at rock-bottom prices . But Tramiel bears some of the responsibility for Commodore 's recent slide . He focused on sales and skimped on research and development of new models . <P> Since he took over after Tramiel 's exit , Smith has been scrambling in vain to bring out a successful follow-up to the Commodore 64 . One candidate that flopped was the Plus-4 . Unveiled in the summer of 1984 , it was more powerful and versatile than the Commodore 64 , but it did not run the same programs as its predecessor . Owners of the 64 who might have upgraded to the Plus-4 were reluctant to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new software libraries . <P> Smith may have made a company-saving move when he bought Amiga Corp. , a small computer firm in Santa Clara , Calif. , for $25 million in October of 1984 . Technology obtained in that acquisition helped Commodore develop its Amiga model , which has drawn praise from industry experts . Among Amiga 's attractive features are its state-of-the-art color graphics and its ability to run more than one program at the same time . <P> Despite the machine 's dazzle , however , Amiga sales are off to a slow start . Commodore has been selling computers through such department stores as K mart and Sears . But that strategy has alienated computer-store owners , many of whom refuse to stock the Amiga . Says Drew Clausen , who owns nine Computerland stores in Los Angeles : " Once you open your product to mass merchandisers , then you 're not selling computers . You 're selling toasters . " Commodore is also having trouble finding a market niche for the Amiga . Business customers are unenthusiastic because it is not compatible with the IBM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a home computer are discouraged by the Amiga 's price : $1,795 with a color monitor .
