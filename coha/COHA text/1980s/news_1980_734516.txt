txt When the President announces his budget later this month . S100 billion will be missing . That is the amount Washington forces private citizens to spend to comply with its rules and regulations . Whereas some good comes from this regulation , much harm does too , and few people believe it contributes $100 billion to the national welfare . But whether you think federal regulation is on balance helpful or harmful , the cost of it should be included in the federal budget because it preempts private expenditures just as do federal taxation and borrowing . Moreover , since regulation is not an item in the budget , there is no control over the amount of resources spent in this way . In effect , federal agencies have acquired de facto the power to tax .

Presently there is no effective control over the vast majority of the federal regulatory agencies . The President ca n't set limits because most of the regulatory agencies are independent commissions or administrations . Congress occasionally intervenes to rein in some of the more outlandish regulatory initiatives , but without a regulatory budget it has no systematic way of controlling the taxing power of the federal bureaucracy . The result is entirely predictable . The agencies have no incentive to consider the cost of compliance when they develop regulations . Lacking a budget restrain/on their activities , they push them to the hilt and over-regulate . A regulatory budget would bring cost-benefit considerations into the picture , and it would also provide a more accurate picture of the federal government 's total impact on the economy . Moreover , as Senator Bentsen points out , a regulatory budget would aid the Congress in choosing between regulatory and spending programs and help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Congress establishes a regulatory budget , neither a spending limitation , a tax limitation , nor a balanced budget amendment will put a meaningful lid on government spending .
