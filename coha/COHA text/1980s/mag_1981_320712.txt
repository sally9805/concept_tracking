TIME 'S Board of Economists reviews the new Administration 's program <P> Is the U.S. " threatened with an economic calamity of tremendous proportions , " as Ronald Reagan told the U.S. two weeks ago ? The TIME Board of Economists met last week to review the state of American business and to try to answer that question . The group 's consensus : though President Reagan 's rhetoric may have been a bit overblown , the economy is indeed in serious trouble . Declining productivity , recalcitrant inflation and the explosion of Government spending have so shackled U.S. business that growth will be sluggish well into the future . Moreover , the time left to reverse that course is growing short . Warned Otto Eckstein , president of Data Resources , an economic consulting firm based in Lexington , Mass. : " The federal budget has tremendous upward momentum . Increases in spending ca n't go on at the rate of the past ten years , or the private sector wo n't be able to function any more . " Manhattan Economic Consultant Alan Greenspan , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Advisory Board , pointed out that towering interest rates are threatening the survival of many American financial institutions . Said he : " A continuation of business as usual will lead us off a cliff . " <P> Reagan 's program of deep budget cuts and generous tax reductions is an ambitious , but unorthodox , attempt to revitalize the economy . He hopes these measures will speed growth , slow inflation and balance the budget by 1983 . But they could also overstimulate the economy and cause even more inflation . The program has thus worried both liberals and some conservatives . Charles L. Schultze , the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under President Carter and a new member of the TIME board , voiced the concern of many Democrats . Said he : " The Administration is pursuing a gung-ho , damn-the-torpedoes , full-speed-ahead policy . " <P> Despite the economy 's surprisingly strong performance in the last three months of 1980 , when it grew at a 5% annual rate , the short-term outlook for the U.S. economy is somber . TIME 'S board foresees another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Interest rates , which rose to more than 20% last December , continue to hurt seriously the all-important housing and automobile industries . The result : the output of goods and services is expected to drop by about .5% in the first half of this year . Concluded Greenspan : " The economy remains weak , and the numbers will confirm this by early spring . " <P> An anemic recovery should begin some time during the summer of 1981 , but growth for the year as a whole is unlikely to be higher than 1.5% . Said Eckstein : " Sizable growth in 1981 is almost impossible . " Thus the economy will remain at a virtual standstill for the third consecutive year . In 1979 growth was a mere 1.7% , and last year there was no economic expansion at all . <P> The sluggish economy will be bac news for those looking for a new job . The board believes that unemployment will rise from its current level of 7.4% to 8% by midyear before dropping back to 7.8% at the end of 1981 . That will leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
