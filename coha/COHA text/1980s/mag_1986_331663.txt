The two countries agreed to form a joint patrol of their 225-mile frontier to prevent clashes between Sandinista forces and U.S.-backed contras based in Costa Rica . The arrangement is designed to avoid incidents like the shooting deaths of two Costa Rican guardsmen last May , which resulted in abruptly severed diplomatic relations .
