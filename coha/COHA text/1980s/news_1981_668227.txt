AUGUSTA , Ga . - The conversation took place during a practice round preceding the Masters Golf Tournament . " How many Masters is this for you ? " David Graham asked Jack Nicklaus . " My 23d , " answered Nicklaus . Greg Norman simply dropped his driver . " Do you realize , " he said to Nicklaus , " that when you played in your first Masters I was two years old ? " Yes , 23 trips to the Masters , a record five green jackets , coholder of the tournament records for low round ( 64 ) and low winning total ( 271 ) , 13 finishes in the top five , and the only player to repeat as a champion . Yes , the imprint of Nicklaus has been indelibly stamped on this tournament virtually from the first time he walked the fairways of the Augusta National as a young amateur in 1959 . And now , at age 41 , the legacy continues to grow . Against a backdrop of a gorgeous early spring setting , Nicklaus seized command of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that ranks right up there with any of the vintage Nicklaus rounds in a major championship to move into the halfway lead with a run of 70-65-135 . On this sultry , windless day when everyone agreed conditions were ideal , Nicklaus wound up four shots in front of Tom Watson ( 68 ) , Lon Hinkle ( 70 ) , Bruce Lietzke ( 67 ) and Norman ( 70 ) , the youthful partner in that practice round who grew up on the Gold Coast of Australia and didn ' t pick up a golf club until he was almost 17 . Defending champion Seve Ballesteros of Spain missed the cut by six shots with 78-76-154 . " I think Nicklaus will be very , very tough to beat , " offered Graham , who was paired with Nicklaus in the opening round and is tied with Hubert Green five shots back at 140 . " Nobody could play any better than he did yesterday.From the fourth hole on he played as fine a round of golf as I ' ve ever seen . " By his own assessment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ higher . The difference was on the greens . He had 35 putts in the round of 70 , just 25 yesterday . " The pin placements today allowed you to be a little more aggressive , " said Nicklaus . " I ' ve been very relaxed , very confident . I haven ' t been jumpy over the ball . I felt I could aim everything at the flagstick . When you get that type of feeling . . . " What makes the 65 even more impressive is the fact that Nicklaus only birdied one of the par 5s . He birdied the 4th ( 3 iron , 1-foot putt ) , 5th ( 5 iron , 20 feet ) , 6th ( 2 iron , 17 feet ) , 7th ( 9 iron , 20 feet ) , 13th ( chip , 3 feet ) , 14th ( 7 iron , 4 feet ) and 16th ( 8 iron , 4 feet ) in a bogey-free round with only 11 putts on the back nine . There is still the possibility that this could wind up as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after a wild tee shot ended up on the 7th green , it seemed Watson might charge within two or three shots of the lead . He had birdied five holes heading to the 17th tee in a round he said was his best of the season . " Today was an ideal day to score , " said Watson , who finished 65- 65 to beat Nicklaus ' 65-66 finish in the 1977 British Open at Turnberry . " On this golf course , a four-shot lead is not insurmountable . But when you ' re trying to catch up , you can ' t afford to make mistakes . My first order of business is to go out and make some birdies . " Lietzke , who has won twice this season and has started to zero in on major championships , has been befuddled on the greens . " I ' ve made three putts over five feet in two days , " he said . " I ' ve missed six or seven inside four feet . I ' m dumbfounded . When it all comes down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes those pressure three- and four-foot putts . Right now I ' m not that man . " Norman , who won the world match-play championship last year and may decide to join the US tour , is a rising star in international golf . In the 20 months after he first picked up a golf club , his handicap went from 27 to scratch . He dropped into the second-place tie on the 18th yesterday when his tee shot strayed into the trees and he missed a five-foot , par-saving putt . Hinkle , who finished third in the US Open and the PGA that Nicklaus won last year , reached all of the par 5s in two and birdied the 2d , 8th and 15th . " There ' s certainly other people I ' d rather try to chase , " said Hinkle , who found out what that was like last summer at Baltusrol and Oak Hill . " How old is he , anyway ? "
