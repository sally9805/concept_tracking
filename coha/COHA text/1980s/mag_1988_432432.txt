 | For high-school seniors revving up for the forthcoming round of graduation parties , it 's an exciting time of year . Their parents , worried that the high jinks will lead to drinking and disaster , would probably like to hold down the excitement level . If you count yourself among these parents , the best way to soothe your nerves ? and guarantee that your teenager ends the evening safely in bed ? may be to throw the party yourself . That , of course , is easier said than done . Even a well-supervised bash in your own back yard can end in disaster . In Vienna , Va. , last year , the parents of one high-school senior learned the first lesson of party planning when they threw a no-alcohol celebration for their son 's class . The affair ended chaotically when police arrived to report that students who appeared to be drunk were milling around the neighborhood . Retha Sammons , the boy 's grandmother and one of eight chaperones , says their mistake was opening the party to the entire class of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invite as many as you can handle , " advises Sammons .

" Kids need to have ownership over a party so they wo n't feel like you 're baby-sitting or spying on them , " says Fran Hurtado , director of youth programs for Mothers Against Drunk Driving . Two adults can probably supervise only 25 or 30 kids comfortably , and even with that small a crowd , it 's a good idea to ask another set of parents to join you for the evening . If you agree at the brainstorming stage on a time for the party to end , and print it on the invitation , you may have better luck getting guests to cooperate when you announce that the party 's over . Given the nature of senior parties , you may have to plan on breakfast at 6 a.m . The longer your guest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will bring party crashers to your door . You may have to greet guests yourself and firmly but gently screen out the uninvited . Once the party is under way , it may be tough to monitor traffic in and out of the house , but your teenager can help by letting guests know that once they leave you wo n't allow them to return , and by keeping the outside doors locked . A raucous group of prospective crash ers loitering outside is another matter . " If you 're comfortable approaching them and you think they 'll leave peacefully , go ahead outside and ask , " advises Brenda Clayburn , a supervisor with the Baltimore City Police Department . " If they 're intoxicated or you sense any trouble , call the police right away . " It ca n't hurt to ask the police to drive by periodically anyway as a precaution . An eagle eye . Many parents assume that all they need worry about is keeping the house in one piece . Not so , says James Goldberg , general counsel for the National Alcoholic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ police your teenager 's friends , you can be held responsible for alcohol or drugs consumed on your property ? whether or not you know about it . If you ca n't prove later that you made a serious effort to keep an eye on the action , you could find yourself losing a lawsuit if a guest who is drunk or high has an accident on the way home . In 18 states with " social host " laws , you may face civil penalties as well if a guest of any age is hurt in an accident caused by liquor served in your home . ( Drugs are n't covered , since they 're illegal anyway . ) Warns Goldberg : " You ca n't just go upstairs , tell the kids to have a good time and pretend not to see . " To pre-empt trouble , it 's a good idea to print a no-alcohol , no-drugs rule on invitations and then keep a high profile at the party . If you spot signs of alcohol or drug use , you may or may not be able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be to prevent anyone who has been drinking or taking drugs from driving away . That may mean notifying parents that a guest needs to be picked up , or it may mean calling a taxi . If the guest 's car is unlocked , you might remove the wire that runs from the ignition coil to the distributor cap to prevent the car from starting . It takes only a moment and requires no tools . Should the worst happen and you land in court as a result of alcohol or drug use in your home , your homeowner 's liability insurance will cover you for civil ? but not criminal ? penalties . Parents who doubt they have the fortitude to entertain a bunch of ebullient seniors may want to band together with other parents to throw a safe party .

Fitness instructors will organize volleyball and basketball @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they come with the deal .
