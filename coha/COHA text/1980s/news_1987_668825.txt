I am upstairs watching an old black-and-white television set with unreliable horizontal hold . Downstairs the good television is in use ; the kids are watching " Dumbo " on the VCR . I am watching the Congress of the United States engaged in righteous indignation . My sons are watching an elephant fly . They believe what they are seeing . I do not . On the way to the store I run into a friend , a contemporary . " I ' ve been watching the hearings on the Iran- contra thing , " I say . " Why ? " she asks evenly . That is a good question . It was not like this in 1974 . I had a spanking new bachelor ' s degree , a sublet on the Upper West Side and a good antenna hookup to a 19-inch color TV . It was hot in New York . It was even hotter in Washington , especially in one particular Senate caucus room  --  the same one I saw the other day , still an architectural monument to the majestic leanings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summer ' s soap opera-cum-civics lesson . John Dean with his ferret-like face ; his wife looking on over his shoulder , her hair pulled firmly back into a no-nonsense chignon . Alexander Butterfield with the big plot twist while I was making a sandwich in the kitchen : " Did you hear that ? " my boyfriend yelled . " He says they bugged the whole damn White House ! " John Ehrlichman , beetle-browed , his expression dark as his boss ' 5 o ' clock shadow ; who knew that he would go on to do ice cream commercials poking fun at his own honesty ? We wouldn ' t have missed it for the world . Inside department stores and taverns people gathered around the television . They thought they were seeing the fall of the Republic . Some of them  --  lots of the ones my age , who had hated Nixon since they had watched him perspire on television in his ill-fated joust against the white knight of our childhood  --  were delighted . Ding , dong , the witch is dead . Some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a president of the United States . Something fell , but it wasn ' t the Republic . Richard Nixon has bounced back ; I never have . I am the typical spurned lover , doubly devastated because I was once a true believer . I gave a speech at a college several weeks ago and afterward , a 19-year- old political science major , an aspiring foreign correspondent in his best job-interview suit , came up and said thoughtfully , " Given the nature of politics , don ' t you think you people overreacted a little to Watergate ? " Effortlessly , he had hit upon the essential difference between us . He was a pragmatist ; I , that most pathetic of creatures , a disenchanted idealist . " Given the nature of politics "  --  we had started from a different place . The place where I started had enormous maple trees , large rhododendron bushes and three Catholic parishes within walking distance of one another . I was 8 years old , an Irish Catholic girl in an Irish Catholic neighborhood in quiet ecstasy at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people kept within themselves an essential patriotism , the obvious corollary to the dog tags stored in the attic beside the letters they had written to their wives from Europe and the Pacific . The younger ones , we children , thought the president had some connection to us , would right wrongs , would slay dragons , would not eat meat on Fridays . God , he was good-looking . God , he could speak . The rest seems to have happened in another world . The president was murdered , the war began , the boy who lived two blocks away and whose sister was in my class came home dead from Vietnam . The first of many . If only the war were over , things would be better . Then it was , and they were not . If only McGovern were elected . If only Nixon were gone . Only the Who said anything that made sense . " Meet the new boss , " they sang , " same as the old boss . " The element of surprise evaporated , too . Like tourists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the underside of the Nixon White House , by the things the president ' s men admitted to . Now , president ' s men are saying they did fearsome things , too . They are on all channels . Ah , but there is always the VCR . Your friends ask , why watch ? Aren ' t we accustomed to it ? Haven ' t we been here before ? When rumor had it that the Irish Catholic president was not as consonant as he should have been with the 6th Commandment , I was pretty thunderstruck : the pretty wife was not happy ; the handsome husband was not faithful . Then there were the stories about his brother . And his other brother . Last week the most prominent person in the news was one of those hyphenated actress-models , as they ' re called . The handsome candidate went on a boat ride . The pretty wife stayed home . In the end , it all came crashing down . We have been here before . It ' s all reruns when you know the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ essential patriotism . They have seen things that I have not . The 19-year- olds are matter-of-fact about what to expect . They never had my illusions . And here I am , feeling a little dumb remembering that I once thought a change in the cast of characters meant a change in the script . It ' s a rotten way to feel . Downstairs , at least the little elephant is flying . Upstairs , it ' s the same old circus . Click goes the on-off button . I ' m better off below.
