Muzak , now 50 , soothes ( or irritates ) 80 million people a day <P> Yes , this was the year in which Ronald Reagan was re-elected to the White House , but those with a broader historical perspective have other things to commemorate . Like the 400th anniversary of Sir Walter Raleigh 's first colony in the New World , the 300th anniversary of the completion of the Hall of Mirrors at Versailles , the 200th anniversary of Mozart 's Marriage of Figaro , the 100th anniversary of the first volume of the Oxford English Dictionary and the 50th anniversary of Muzak . Muzak ? Would n't that be like celebrating the first broadcast singing commercial ( 1924 ) ? <P> The sound of Muzak is , of course , almost everywhere , and metastasizing : in the bank and the supermarket and the of fice elevator , on the telephone line when the victim has been put on hold . It plays in the White House and the Pentagon ; it played during the Olympics ; it played in the Apollo XI spaceship that carried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which is now part of Westinghouse , estimates that its recordings are heard by 80 million people every day ; they are syndicated in 19 countries ; the company and its affiliates take in more than $150 million annually . " Muzak promotes the sharing of meaning , " says James Keenan , an industrial psychologist and chairman of the firm 's board of scientific advisers , " because it massifies symbolism in which not few but all can participate . " But not quite all , Dr. Keenan . <P> " Horrible stuff ' was the term once applied by the artist Ben Shahn . " Abominably offensive , " said the novelist Vladimir Nabokov . And Philip Glass : " The range of music is truly enormous-opera at the top , Muzak at the bottom . " John Cage spoke of composing a piece especially for the tormentors , with no notes in it . " The first step in describing silence is to use silence itself , " Cage explained . " Matter of fact , I thought of composing a piece like that . It would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Muzak . " Perhaps Cage had that in mind when he created 4 ' 33 " , which consists of one or more musicians sitting on a stage and not playing their instruments for 4 min. 33 sec . <P> That Muzak should soothe the inhabitants of the Pentagon is fitting , for the whole system was basically the creation of an unusual general , George Owen Squier , a West Pointer ( ' 87 ) who devoted much of his Army career to science . Assigned to evaluate the military potential in the experiments of the Wright Brothers , he became in 1908 one of the first passengers to fly , for all of nine minutes , in a Wright machine . As a young artilleryman , he invented the polarizing photochronograph to measure the speed of a projectile . <P> On the U.S. entry into World War I , Squier became head of the Signal Corps , and his omnivorous curiosity led to a notable invention : a system for transmitting several messages simultaneously over existing electric power lines . In 1922 , nearing retirement , he took his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ combine , which backed him in launching Wired Radio , Inc. , a kind of competitor to the booming fad for wireless radio . But not until 1934 , the year of his death , did the general think up a catchy new name , combining the sound of music with the sound of the popular camera called the Kodak .
