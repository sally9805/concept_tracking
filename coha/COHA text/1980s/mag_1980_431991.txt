 | Almost all of us in business have complained at one time or another about the cost ? and the reach ? of government regulation . It now seems to me our complaints have become self-defeating excuses . American businessmen , in fact , are hiding behind government regulations . They 're using the excesses and inefficiencies of Big Government to excuse lackluster management , poor technology and deteriorating productivity . I do n't mean the complaints are n't valid , just that we 've heard enough of them . Government is n't the whole problem , no matter how big and how intrusive it is or may become . Getting rid of government ? and government 's regulations ? would n't be the whole solution , either . This is n't to say that government and its regulations are a good thing , only that they are n't as good an excuse as some of us think . If we could claim that government 's growth over the last 50 years has come at the expense of business , or the average family 's standard of living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't , because it has n't . While government has grown into the half-trillion-dollar leviathan it has become , the economy , by and large , has prospered , and our standard of living soared . In that same period of enormous governmental growth , business has expanded , the number of jobs has doubled and the quality , of the average worker 's life in America has bested that of any other society in history . The growth of government did n't cause that success ? but it did n't prevent it , either , and that 's an important distinction . Let 's stop telling ourselves how easily we could solve our economic problems if only we could change the policies ? or the politicians ? in Washington . What about the policies in corporate boardrooms ? - Help : We like to preach the virtues of a free society , but at the first signs of trouble , the air lanes to Washington are filled with businessmen looking for help . George P. Shultz , former Secretary of the Treasury , said that one of his biggest disappointments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Washington , pleading for wageand-price controls . The point is , we ca n't have it both ways . American businessmen have to square their - practices with their principles , because the American people wo n't tolerate anything less . They will never accept a system that allows us to keep our profits , while our losses are subsidized with their tax dollars . It 's time we set aside Big Government as the Big Excuse and get to work on a more serious problem ? our vanishing productivity . Since 1966 , and particularly since 1970 , while the United States progressed slowly ? when it progressed at all ? our economic competitors have thrived . Washington is part of the productivity problem , but so is business management . A recent management survey found that U.S. workers are only two-thirds as productive as their grandfathers were ? but the survey blamed management , not the workers . Fully 30 per cent of a workday is lost , the survey concluded , through scheduling problems , unclear communication of assignments , improper staffing and poor discipline . Lay the blame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old and outmoded production equipment that might have served their grandfathers well , but ca n't do the job today . American industry no longer seems willing to risk its resources on capital investments for the future . British essayist Henry Fairlie says of us : " The once rambunctious American spirit of innovation and adventurousness is today being paralyzed by the desire to build a riskfree society . " Indeed , America 's dismal economic record during the last decade reflects , more than anything else , an astonishing decline in research and development , innovation and productive risk-taking . Through it ' all , the American economy has proven to be unusually strong and resilient , and depending on how you look at it ? either because of American industry , or in spite of it ? it 's likely to remain so . The one great lie in this country ? and it has to be exposed ? is that it 's all over for us , that the age of innovation has ended . We are prosperous , it is said , because we have an abundance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find ourselves in a place with most of the world 's coal , much of its oil and a lot of its gas , ores , minerals and farmland . The corollary to that myth is that , as those resources run out , or seem to , so does our luck run out . I do n't agree , not just because I find it totally unacceptable , but because I believe it 's totally avoidable . The wealth , at least of this nation , is not in the ground . It 's in our minds ? and that is a renewable resource . We can create new wealth , and we have . Costs : We have entered a new , electronic age that we created and where we clearly excel . Electronic circuits have become the bargain of the century . The cost of a high-quality transistor in an integrated circuit has dropped in twenty years from $20 to one-fiftieth of a cent . Computers , which have become indispensable to our way of life , operate at 7 cents per million calculations today , when twenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my business , we 've , lowered the cost of making a copy from 8.5 cents on the Xerox 914 , which revolutionized the copier industry twenty years ago , to just over a penny today ? and our most advanced copier-duplicators will give you those copies at the rate of two a second . Over the past decade , the compound annual rate of productivity growth for the U.S. semiconductor industry has been a spectacular 22.5 per cent . In the next twenty years , our knowledge of electronics ? and our ability to apply it intelligently ? will have a profound effect on how we live and - work , but more to the point , on how well we do each . Ahead are new generations of microcircuits that will spawn a multibillion-dollar market for electronic sensors , controls , machines and computers of all sizes and types for consumer and industrial applications of every description . With , the technology we 've developed , we can revitalize our tired industrial machine and restore it to its rightful place among our competitors . I mean that both as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
