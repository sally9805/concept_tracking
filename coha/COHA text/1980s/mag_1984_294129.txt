" He is a friend and adviser , a very talented man , very intelligent , very creative , possibly a genius . " The high praise came from Gary Hart . The object of his admiration : Pat Caddell , 33 , the former whiz-kid pollster who has become a key figure in the Hart campaign since coming aboard as " an informal adviser " in January . <P> For Caddell , joining Hart is a homecoming . When Hart was managing George McGovern 's campaign in 1972 , he asked Caddell , then a precocious Harvard senior majoring in government , to do the candidate 's polling . <P> Caddell went on to become a trusted adviser for Jimmy Carter . Sometimes his advice went badly awry . It was Caddell who urged President Carter to deliver his controversial 1979 " malaise " speech , which suggested that the nation was gripped by despair and self-doubt . <P> Vice President Mondale had vociferously objected to the speech , arguing that it was both wrongheaded and politically unwise . Confident that voters responded well to negative campaigns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reagan as a racist and warmonger . The strategy backfired . <P> Strong-willed and often abrasive , Caddell last year shopped around for a candidate to run in the Democratic primaries . He sounded out Senators Dale Bumpers of Arkansas , Christopher Dodd of Connecticut and Joseph Biden of Delaware , but none were willing . <P> Last November he devised a poll that asked Iowa voters to choose between " hypothetical " candidates . One was dedicated to traditional politics and special interests ; the other , young and imaginative , stressed new ideas and called for a new generation of leadership . Caddell professed surprise at how many people chose the Hart-like candidate in his loaded formulation . Again , Mondale and his aides were outraged . <P> Caddell also circulated a 150-page memo among leading Democrats , arguing that the party could beat Reagan by stressing the new-generation themes that are the core of the Hart campaign . <P> Hart was leery at first about Caddell , since the aggressive pollster tends to dominate a campaign . But so far the partnership has been smooth . Arguing that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persuaded him to give his message a " populist tinge . " <P> Caddell , says one Hart staffer , " helped Gary sharpen the contrast between himself and Mondale . " Says Caddell : <P> " As the campaign got focused , Hart got focused . ' New ideas ' is not the issue . New leadership is the issue . "
