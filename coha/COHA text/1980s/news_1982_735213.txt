txt Renate Allen drives through a swirling snowstorm , taking her daughter to an appointment with the pediatrician in this Salt Lake City suburb . As they approach the low-slung , motellike building , signs in the driveway point the way : " Appointments  --  Brown Doors . Accidents ? Orange Doors . Business ? Glass Doors . " Mrs. Allen stops near one of the six brown doors and leads her daughter , eightyear-old Michelle , through a door with a green light over it , directly into an examining room . The room looks like a motel room , with a divan , stuffed chairs and walnut-finish chest of drawers . Inside , Mrs. Allen and Michelle hear a taped message that the doctor is on schedule and will see them shortly . The doctor 's aides have noted their arrival with the help of closed-circuit cameras in the parking area and a computerized device that records their time of entering the examining room . New Idea The doctor , Glen C. Griffin , has one of the nation 's few such drive-in pediatrics offices . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he extols its benefits : " The usual medical waiting room is a hotbed of infection , not a nice place to take your child . " Dr. Griffin 's office , moreover , is probably the most automated , at least for an individual practitioner . Glenn Austin of Los Altos , Calif. , the president of the American Academy of Pediatrics , says of Dr. Griffin 's facility here : " Nobody else has applied electronics the way Dr. Griffin has . " Dr. Austin suggests that the drive-in concept has a limited application , as it probably would n't be feasible in dense , high-overhead areas . And he adds , " The electronic drive-in office is fine as long as you do n't lose the personal doctor-patient relationship in the process . " Bountiful 's Dr. Griffin believes his facility enhances this relationship . " I want my patients to feel as relaxed as if they were at home . " he says . " That can be part of the treatment . " A tall , thin-faced man with spectacles , Dr. Griffin disdains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affectation . He is in shirtsleeves this day , even in the frigid weather . Increased Efficiency Dr. Griffin designed the office himself in 1976 after concluding that his old office was inefficient for him as well as for his patients . " I wondered if patients could be handled on the day the problem appears , through an efficient operation , " he says . " If the appointment is four , five days in the future , it may not do the patient any good . " So the office now normally handles same-day appointments , six days a week . The examination rooms are joined at the rear to a long hall and an open area through which the doctor makes his rounds , accompanied by an aide . Lights at the doors indicate where the patients are waiting , and timers indicate how long the patients have been there . The system allows Dr. Griffin to handle an average of 40 patients a day and peak penods of 50 patients a day , against the average pediatrician 's patient quota of 30 a day . " Efficiency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It does n't mean robbing the patient of needed attention . " Other efficiencies in the Griffin office are a laboratory for on-the-spot tests and a routine system to provide the , parents with records of the child 's diagnosis and treatment . Dr. Griffin . whose syndicated medical column appears in such papers as the Houston Post and Salt Lake City Deseret News , also provides the parent with copies of articles he has written that are relevant to the patient 's condition . " He tells you everything , " says Annette DeMille , who has brought her six-year-old son . Andy , to Dr. Griffin for treatment of an allergy . She also likes the privacy . " I do n't have to worry about my children catching diseases from other kids waiting in a reception room . " Experts concede that there is some danger of patients ' exchanging germs in crowded reception rooms , but Dr. Edward J. Saltzman of Hollywood , Fla. , the chairman on practices for the American Academy of Pediatrics , says there Is some benefit in the traditional waiting room . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sitting in the waiting room , and they get reassurance about the things they ate doing , " he says . But he adds that the drive-in offices work well for many patients and parents . Susan Evans and her two-year-old son , Alan . certainly find the Griffin office to their liking . Alan spends the time waiting for the doctor 's arrival swinging on the curtains , and when the doctor arrives he shows off his Popeye sweatshirt . Dr. Griffin reaches into the chest of drawers that serves as his medical-supplies cabinet and picks up a light to examine Alan 's ear infection . Next , lie pulls out a tongue depressor , examines Alan 's throat and , without looking , tosses the depressor over his shoulder and hits the wastebasket dead center . Duplicated Rooms " Every examining room is exactly the same , " Dr. Griffin explains , and each is a fully equipped office . " So I do n't have to search for anything , even the wastebasket . " Dr. Griffin , who sometimes talks of his operation in terms more appropriate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into ways to use microprocessors to eliminate button-pushing for the eight tape recordings he uses to convey information to patients in the examining rooms . The tapes , and indeed all the office functions , are a Griffin family affair . Dr. Griffin 's wife . Mary Ella , is the office registered nurse . Four of their six children , ages 13 through 19 , help out in the office . The tapes are recorded by the children , for instance . When the doctor is delayed by an emergency , young patients hear this recording : First voice : " Please sit down and rest awhile . The doctor is delayed . " Second voice , interrupting : " But it 's going to be for more than a little while . " First voice : " I know . There 's been an emergency . " Second voice : " What 's an emergency ? " The conversation continues , giving the patients the feeling that they are n't being needlessly neglected . Meantime , the receptionist is phoning to tell patients with later appointments to delay their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opens the office daily at 7 a.m. and answers the phone to schedule appointments starting at 8 a.m . Few House Calls The early opening of the office has reduced Dr. Griffin 's house calls to a minimum , because parents can call starting at 7 a.m. for same-day appointments . As Dr. Griffin makes his rounds of his look-alike examining rooms , he arrives on schedule at the room where Mrs. Allen and young Michelle are awaiting a report on Michelle 's head injury , sustained in a fall . " Everything is fine , " he says without preliminaries on entering the room . " The Xrays show that nothing serious is behind those headaches . " As he proceeds to examine Michelle 's eyes , he asks Mrs. Allen , " Has she been eating a lot of chocolate ? Chocolate causes migraine headaches for some people . She may be allergic to chocolate . So let 's cut it out . See that she gets plenty of rest and then let 's watch what happens . " Dr. Griffin telephones his daughter Jill , 13 , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ headaches . Mrs. Allen and Michelle , much relieved by the diagnosis , head back into the Utah snowstorm.
