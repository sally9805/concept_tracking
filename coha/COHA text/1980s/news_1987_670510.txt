She knows better than to think that happy families fill all those bright rooms because her married friends tell her otherwise , as do authorities as diverse as Masters and Johnson and Irving Berlin. // And she loves her life of hard work and good friends , of stimulating days that end with cultural events , gymnasium workouts or takeout Chinese and a soak in the tub. // Still , just months from her 40th birthday , she finds that the fantasy tugs at her , as it does at so many among the growing ranks of single women who find they outnumber single men at just the time that their biological clocks are ticking the loudest . <> <> Achievers ' Lament // These women are part of a scrutinized subculture in New York City and across the nation , as unmarried women , their numbers increasing , complain bitterly about their love lives and their marriage prospects. // They are the achievers , largely upper middle class and college educated , the first daughters of the feminist movement to move in waves into traditionally male professions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money and a modicum of power - and so their nagging dissatisfaction is a particularly telling statement about the loneliness of women who were raised on dreams of weddings but came of age in far more complicated times. // " We ' re great women , everybody keeps telling us that , " said a Broadway actress . " Maybe that ' s the problem . There ' s only so many people out there for us. " // Many of these women never intended to be single and childless . They yearn for a family and fear growing old alone . They date rarely and find fewer suitable men now that they have gained professional stature and learned to treasure independence . They no longer organize their lives around the search for Prince Charming . But , in some inchoate way , they assume he is around the next corner . <> <> Looking For Happiness // Typical is a 39-year-old television producer . " I went back to an old shrink recently and he asked me if I was happy enough , " she said . " I told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' s really the truth . I love what I do . I love my friends . I love my apartment . I have a rich , full life . I never sit home at night . Part of me wonders if I could be married to somebody now , because I have such a nice little world . But I haven ' t really stopped looking . I ' d be lying if I said I ' d given up. " // Two recent studies about the marriage prospects of these women spurred a flurry of attention by news organizations and a strong reaction from feminists who argued that many women are single by choice. // The first study , by Neil G. Bennett , a Yale sociologist , and David E. Bloom , a Harvard economist , pre-dicted that women past 30 have a 20 percent chance of marrying and those over 40 a 2. 6 percent chance . The other , by the United States Census Bureau , raises the odds at 30 years to 66 percent and at 40 to 23 percent. // The studies prompted a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used an unconventional mathematical model and a far smaller data base . No one disputed that after the age of 35 , there are simply more women than men. // According to the 1980 census , there were 167 , 000 unmarried women between the ages of 35 and 44 in the New York region , compared with 129 , 000 unmarried men in the same age group . Ten years ago , these women represented 18 percent of their age group and today they represent 29 percent , a " considerable " increase , according to Arlene Saluter , a Census Bureau statistician. // Precise figures on unmarried business and professional women in New York are not readily available . Ms. Saluter said the Census Bureau does not break the statistics down that way , but she assumes their numbers are generally reflected in the larger sample. // The reasons for the increasing ranks of single women , experts say , are demographic , social and psychological , and include these : // * These women were born in the baby-boom years , and as they seek to marry men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fewer around . This problem gets worse as women get older because of their longer life expectancy. // * While women tend to marry " up " both in age and status , men tend to marry " down , " leaving a surplus of successful women , particularly in the older age groups. // * Men classified as unmarried by the Census Bureau include homosexuals , who various studies show outnumber lesbians by at least 3 to 1. // * Many women , thanks to the feminist movement , no longer derive their economic or social status from their husbands and therefore do not rush into early marriages as often as their predecessors. // * Many single women in their 30 ' s and 40 ' s have histories of relationships with unavailable men , frequently married ones . <> <> Confronting Social Stigma // Women with less glamorous jobs seem to suffer far more from their singleness . At a recent singles gathering at the 92d Street Y , for instance , a Brooklyn schoolteacher expressed envy of another woman , who worked as a recruiter for a Wall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ re terrifically located to meet men , " said the teacher. // The recruiter answered with a grim chuckle and the assurance that she , too , had no one to go out with . Later , the recruiter conceded that despite a lack of dates , her work put her in contact with a varied cast of interesting people and her salary allowed such extras as health club memberships , theater tickets and new clothes. // " When you have a boring , day-to-day job , dating becomes more important , " said Hollace Beer , a social worker , herself single and 38 years old . " You need someone to bring to you the kind of excitement that you ' re not creating yourself. " // But even professional woman may feel a stigma in being single and are reluctant to talk about their status . More than half of the two dozen women interviewed for this article insisted that they not be identified. // Many women said some dissatisfaction could stem from others ' expectations . " There ' s always a lingering doubt , because of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ E. Shalala , the 46-year-old president of Hunter College. // Jeanne Golly , 46 , said it did not dawn on her until recently that she need not apologize for her life . " Society said I should have a love relaionship , and when I didn ' t , I wondered what was wrong with me , " said Ms. Golly , a marketing consultant . " Then toward the age of 40 , I woke up and said , ' Hey , I need to shift something here and live this life for me , not somebody else . ' " <> <> Aging Brings Acceptance // " Living this life for me " is an acquired skill that single women seem to get better at with age . " People who are successful learn to cope with situations as they ' re presented and make the best of it , " said the 39-year-old owner of a public-relations firm , who said she grows increasingly satisfied with her single life. // These somewhat older women , more often than their counterparts in their early to mid-30 ' s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more likely to own their own apartments or country houses . They say they have learned to socialize more easily with both single people and couples and attend parties alone without feeling like a fifth wheel . They describe close relationships with children , those of their friends or of their siblings. // They also report deep and rich attachments with female friends , who become a surrogate family . As an aside , women speculate that single men , despite their social advantages , suffer more from loneliness since they are less likely to have formed such bonds. // " Intimacy is an integral part of the healthy human condition , " said Ellen Fleysher , 41 , an assistant news director at WNBC-TV . " If you don ' t have daily intimate connection with a spouse , what fills that need ? Friends fill that need - warm , loving friends.

" Then I force myself to do it again. " // Very few of the older women reported an active social life , in the traditional sense . " I ' m out every night of the week with business-type things , but that ' s not a quote-unquote social life , " said a 39-year-old public-relations executive. // Another woman said she could barely remember her last " real " date . " Putting on a black dress , when it ' s dusk and you feel those butterflies . . . " she said , her voice trailing off wistfully . " I have to really reach back into my emotional memory for that kind of excitement . " <> <> More Barriers To Being Hurt // Many woman balked at the frequent charge that they didn ' t date because they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my standards , " said one . " I ' m not saying he has to be six feet tall , blond and captain of the football team . But , our minds have to fit like a jigsaw puzzle. " // At a recent singles lecture at the 92d Street Y , one woman chided another for finicky behavior . " This gentleman looks like a nice gentleman , " the first woman said . " What are you , Sophia Loren ? " Her friend walked off in a huff. // But certain women admitted that they are standoffish in social settings . They speculated that they had cultivated a " don ' t you dare mess with me " style early in their professional lives , when men dominated the workplace . This style , they feared , now inhibited their social lives. // " One of the things I ' ve heard all my life is that I intimidate people , " said a 39-year-old businesswoman . " But that ' s protective ; it helped me professionally. " // Some women conceded that their choices are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ m only good with someone who ' s bad for me , " said a 32-year-old writer . " I look across the table sometimes and I think , ' What ' s wrong with me ? He likes me . He laughs at my jokes . He went to college . ' But I don ' t feel a rise . That ' s a sickness , almost. " // That syndrome , experts say , is common and signals a fear of commitment. // " Often , it is rooted in childhood , " said Edith Gilson , a vice president at the J. Walter Thompson advertising agency and the author of " Unnecessary Choices : The Hidden Lives of Executive Women . " " When you think of your mother as helpless , unable to choose her own life , you become determined never to be vulnerable. " // A 44-year-old therapist said she finally concluded she was single because of her own choices and entered intensive analysis . " Women are in this situation because of neurotic conflicts , " she said . " I see it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And I see it in my patients . " <> <> Independence Or Intimacy // Many women reported a growing pleasure in their privacy , some relieved by this feeling of self-sufficiency and others fearful they had become too rigid to connect . . " What you would gain in companionship , " said one woman , " you would lose in control of your own life. " // Jim Patterson , an unmarried 40-year-old advertising executive , described a new attitude among his unattached female friends . " They talk about having their apartment the way they like it , and not having to answer to anyone , " said Mr. Patterson , a senior vice president at J. Walter Thompson . " They say they went a whole weekend without talking to anyone and it was great . It ' s like the old bachelor syndrome . Men always wanted their space. " // But such independence is a double-edged sword . One woman described a longing " to be bound up in another person ' s life and have him bound up in mine . " Another woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work or want to sound off about your mother. " // " Female friends can fill that void , " she said , " but sometimes their lives are blasting off in other directions. " // As the time between relationships lengthens , women report that their interest in both love and sex declines . They compared this to giving up cigarettes , when the discomfort eventually disappears , except for unpredictable but sharp cravings. // " When it sneaks back into your life , " one woman said , " you think , ' Oh , boy , this is nice. ' " // With a handful of exceptions , all the women interviewed grieved over the possibility of living out their lives without children . Many of the ones close to 40 knew someone who had decided to have a baby alone or adopt , or were themselves considering such alternatives as taking foster children . Some have sounded out male friends about fathering a child. // But , the vast majority said they had decided that single parenthood is not the solution for them . And they described @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we all get dealt a hand , " said the 39-year-old television producer . " Some people are dealt disease . It ' s not as if we got a hand without a husband and baby and everybody else got a full deck. " // Women who are content most of the time report bad patches , like holidays or vacations . Many of them say they go to the office on Sunday , complaining about overwork but privately grateful for a way to avoid feeling left out among the brunching couples and families pushing strollers. // " When my married or professional friends are closed out , that ' s the only time I feel a real void , " said one woman. // Several studies over the years have concluded that single women are happier than their married sisters . But , this flies in the face of experience for Nancy Stapleton , a hairdresser , who listens to the stories that women reserve for their psychiatrists and the people who snip or curl their hair. // " They seem to feel they ' re missing something and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Ms. Stapleton said of her single clients . " You remind them that they ' re very successful and they say , ' Yeah , but . . . ' Married women don ' t have as many ' Yeah , buts ' - or at least they don ' t verbalize them.
