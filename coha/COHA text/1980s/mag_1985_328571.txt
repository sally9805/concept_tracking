The six-year-old girl marched into the chambers of Los Angeles Judge Aviva Bobb two weeks ago and said she was afraid to tell the truth in court . Clutching a large teddy bear for support , she had already testified that Raymond Buckey , a preschool teacher , had sexually molested her , then killed a turtle in her presence and warned that her parents would also be killed if she told what had happened . Though she did finally complete her testimony , the girl 's father pointed out that Buckey 's presence caused her fear , " a good argument for closed-circuit TV . " <P> With more and more young witnesses now being called in abuse and molestation trials , that argument made sense to California Governor George Deukmejian . Two weekends ago he signed the first legislation in the U.S. allowing simultaneous , two-way closed-circuit television for some children under eleven in molestation cases . The system is designed to separate the accused from the accuser , while allowing each to see and hear the other on TV screens during testimony . Defense attorneys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sixth Amendment right of defendants to confront their accusers , whatever their age . The question will be whether confronting the witness through a TV screen satisfies the Constitution .
