Feeling down in the dumps again ? Trapped in a morass of bleakness and gloom ? May we suggest a little music to complement your mood ? Try a platter by the Canadian trio Skinny Puppy . A Vancouver-based band formed some four years ago , Skinny Puppy plays a brand of rock that is nothing if not dark and doomy . Not to mention a tad peculiar and creepy . Combining highly percussive electronics work with odd sound effects and guttural , growling vocals , their music is a bit difficult to describe but is roughly equivalent to a Transylvanian Capt . Beefheart having a breakdown in a steel mill . For their stage show , the lads in Skinny Puppy dress in black and project a variety of slides , some of them with stark , disturbing images , onto a movie screen . At one time , they staged a fake throat-slashing with fake blood during shows but now have dropped that bit of business . Their aim , they say , is to get a reaction  --  any kind of reaction  --  from an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chicago audience reacts when they play Cabaret Metro . ) Curious about the details of the band ' s current show , we phoned Skinny Puppy vocalist Nivek Ogre ( whose name was Kevin Ogilvie before he joined the band ) . Ogre , 24 , told us that Skinny Puppy has stopped using video monitors as part of its stage show because of the expense involved in doing video presentations effectively . Ogre told us that he and bandmates Kevin Cey and Dwayne Goettel are playing guitar , drums and synthesizers this time around . Ogre told us that the band ' s next album , " Cleanse , Fold and Manipulate , " will be out this summer . Ogre informed us that he owns three or four pairs of pants , all black , and four or five shirts . After that , the information got a bit more . . . rarefied , as you will see in the following partial transcript of the conversation : Tribune : What ' s the staging for your current show like ? Is it elaborate ? Bare-bones ? " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up with . Some very interesting structures which have , you know , a purpose in being there . " As well , there ' s a number of different things being dealt with , found , persuaded and shifted from one part to another to create something altogether different in the end . I ' m real happy with the way this show is developing over the course of this tour . It was in its development stages for the first part . But now we can work in between the spaces . It ' s gotten into a place where it ' s really improvising . " The show still has a dark character to it , right ? " Very much . " How did you get into that dark sort of presentation ? Does it reflect something from your everyday life ? " It was just one day . And then three weeks later another day . Then a while after that another day . Where three separate things . . . If you could imagine your life revolving around three pillars  --  your family , your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fall apart . They were all just pretty well gone . " You ' re talking about something that happened in your own life ? " Yeah . So that ' s where that all arose from . I was dealing with it in my own way at the time . I can ' t be any more honest than that . " Has your personal life gotten any better ? " To a certain extent . I just kind of struggle through things , never really being satisfied . It ' s like this tour . It ' s a really hard tour , and you ' re always examining yourself because you ' re putting yourself in front of people every night , and I ' m my worst critic . " Do you ever encounter people who say that what you ' re doing is just a rehash of Bauhaus and Alice Cooper ? " Yeah , a lot of people say that , but I never saw Bauhaus live . I ' ve never seen Alice Cooper ; I ' ve just heard about him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ introverted . Just going through a lot of . . . I don ' t know . . . strange things . I didn ' t go anywhere . I ' m still quite introverted , but when I ' m onstage I can become this obsessive extrovert . It ' s good . " There must be more to you than just the dark side . Nobody ' s one- dimensional . " I think you ' ll see from the show there ' s a lot of trying to make what ' s black transparent . Within everything is its opposite . We are very dark because that ' s a satisfactory way to get across to people , if you want to hit people with something that blasts them out of their complacency . " You probably realize you ' re never going to make megabucks doing this . " No , we won ' t . If I can get by doing this and satisfy my personal needs and keep going and keep doing this . . . It doesn ' t take that much to live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' t really need that . " CAPTION : PHOTO : Nivek Ogre and Dwayne Goettel ( left ) and Cevin Key ( right ) .
