WASHINGTON  --  The robust December unemployment report , showing a drop in the civilian jobless rate to 5. 8% , underscores the economy ' s strength following the stock market crash and suggests it started 1988 on a healthy note . The decline from 5. 9% of the work force in November left the unemployment rate at its lowest level since it was 5. 7% in July 1979 . Joblessness stood at 6. 7% in December 1986 . The drop was accompanied by impressive growth in non-farm business payrolls , which rose by 326 , 000 in December after a 263 , 000-job gain in November . For the year , payroll employment rose by three million . Such growth is unusually strong for this late in an economic expansion . " It ' s very encouraging , " said Lawrence Chimerine , chairman of WEFA Group , a consulting firm in Bala Cynwyd , Pa . " The most you can say is the crash has had a marginal effect , if any , so far on the economy . " He cautioned , however , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spending as a result of the Oct. 19 market plunge to show up in lower production and employment . Still , the strong job growth leaves the economy well-positioned to withstand any crash-related damage that shows up . Kathleen Cooper , chief economist at Security Pacific National Bank in Los Angeles , said , " This is a very positive report . Some people are worried about the economy being terribly weak in the first half but this suggests we had good momentum " going into the new year . By bringing the jobless rate further below 6% , a level that many economists regard as " full employment , " the latest decline may renew worries about a resurgence in inflation . The report on the unemployment rate was cited as a contributing factor in the big decline in financial markets Friday . In the wake of the October market crash , however , economists generally are more worried about a slowdown in economic growth than about inflation . In fact , inflation measures in the unemployment report eased last month . Average hourly earnings fell to $9. 11 from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earnings index , which excludes wage gains caused by factory overtime and shift differentials , fell to 175. 6% of its 1977 average from 175. 8% . The report showed that manufacturing jobs increased 40 , 000 in December after rising 89 , 000 in November . Much of the rise reflects strong export growth . Machinery and electrical equipment accounted for half of the latest increase . Weekly factory hours remained high while slipping to 41. 1 from 41. 2 . Factory overtime was unchanged at 3. 9 hours . Overall , weekly hours fell to 34. 7 from 34. 9 . Total goods-producing employment , which also includes mining and construction , grew 97 , 000 last month after a 109 , 000-job gain in November . Construction jobs increased 55 , 000 after rising 24 , 000 the month before , but several economists said such growth is unlikely to be sustained . Employment in the service sector rose 229 , 000 after a 154 , 000 increase in November . Janet Norwood , commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics , suggested in a statement that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ significantly hurt employment in the finance and retail trade industries , as many economists expect . Finance industry employment was unchanged last month , but job growth in that sector had begun to slow last spring as a result of weakness in banking . Overall , retail employment hasn ' t changed much in the past two months , although general merchandise stores have shown particular weakness . Using a measure that counts the military among the employed , the jobless rate fell to 5. 7% in December from 5. 8% . The department ' s household survey , which is used in calculating the unemployment rate , showed a 240 , 000-job rise last month after a 294 , 000-job increase in November . The rate for teen-agers fell to 16. 1% from 16. 6% , while the rate for Hispanics fell to 8. 1% from 9% . The monthly figures are adjusted for seasonal variation .
