It is not often that companies cheer the news that a competitor has beaten them to market with a hot new product . But something like that happened last week when the Food and Drug Administration announced that it had approved commercial production of a new vaccine against hepatitis B , a virus that causes an incurable and sometimes fatal liver disease and strikes an estimated 200,000 new victims every year in the U.S. Developed by Merck , the New Jersey-based pharmaceutical giant , in partnership with Chiron , a small ( 1985 sales : $6 million ) biotech firm in Emeryville , Calif. , the product is the first genetically engineered vaccine approved for human use . " We 're delighted that FDA has expressed such a positive view about the usefulness of recombinant technology for vaccines , " said Stephen Sherwin , the director of clinical research in immunology at South San Francisco-based Genentech , a rival biotech company . " It 's another example of the technology yielding real benefits , " said Dr. Thomas White , vice president for research at Cetus , another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industry . " <P> Merck , which funded much of the research and has licensed Chiron 's technology for the new product , will sell the hepatitis B vaccine under the name Recombivax HB . The vaccine will join a handful of pioneering products of recombinant DNA , or gene splicing , that have reached the market , including human insulin ( 1982 ) , human growth hormone ( 1985 ) and alpha interferon ( 1986 ) . The FDA approval of Recombivax HB is expected to give a big boost to the public image of an industry that has been more promising than profitable . Said Chiron President Edward Penhoet : " We think this vaccine will usher in a whole new generation of vaccines . " <P> Indeed , at least three other companies  --  Genentech , Biogen and Genetic Systems  --  are developing their own versions of genetically engineered hepatitis B vaccines . Researchers at a number of firms are also working on vaccines for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome , herpes , other forms of hepatitis and some types of cancer . <P> Recombivax HB is made by inserting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The yeast cells then multiply rapidly and manufacture large amounts of a protein from the virus . This protein forms the basis of the new vaccine , which triggers an immune reaction when injected into humans . <P> The vaccine is the second developed for hepatitis B. But the other one , introduced in 1982 and also marketed by Merck , is somewhat less desirable because it must be made from the blood of infected individuals . Though there have been no reported cases of infection stemming from Merck 's blood-based vaccine , the possibility that diseases such as AIDS and hepatitis B could be transmitted in blood products always exists . Recombivax HB eliminates that possibility , however slight . <P> For the time being , both vaccines will cost patients $110 for a course of three inoculations . After the development costs for Recombivax HB are recovered , however , it may become cheaper than the blood-based alternative . Reason : the prolific yeast will make it easier to mass-produce Recombivax HB.                  @ @ @
