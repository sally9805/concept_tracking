For the more than 6,000 worshipers in attendance , the ceremony in an Alpine meadow near the Swiss hamlet of Econe was deeply moving . To the Vatican , it was anathema . By consecrating four bishops against Rome 's wishes , traditionalist Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre , 82 , opened the first schism in the Roman Catholic Church in eight decades . The result : instant excommunication for Lefebvre and his new prelates . <P> The excommunication is Rome 's final action against Lefebvre , who opposed the liberalizing policies of the 1962-65 Second Vatican Council and then set up his own seminary in Econe . An agreement worked out last month seemed to herald a reconciliation , but it collapsed three weeks ago . By going ahead with the ceremony , Lefebvre sought to perpetuate his 100,000-member renegade movement , since his newly consecrated bishops can in turn ordain their own priests . Dismissing his excommunication , the Archbishop declared , " I am a bishop of the Catholic Church who will continue to spread the faith . "         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
