As the crowd chanted " Matti ! Matti ! " and his countrymen waved blue-and-white Finnish flags , the superbrat of ski jumping shot down the runway at 54 m.p.h . Body tucked , hands behind his back , he soared off as though someone had slipped a piece of hot charcoal into his ski boot . <P> It was a typical Matti Nykanen performance : an explosive takeoff , an eerily long floating descent and  --  as of right  --  a first-place finish . The boyish Nykanen , 24 , punched the air in triumph and seemed to ignore the awed congratulations of Pavel Ploc and Jiri Malec , the Czechs who finished a distant second and third . The decisive win in the 70-meter competition gave Nykanen his first gold at Calgary , with a shot at an unprecedented second and third this week in the weather-delayed 90-meter individual and team events . It also made him the first jumper in some 50 years to finish first in more than one Olympics . <P> In his two runs before an anxious crowd of 52,000 onlookers at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ identical jumps of 294 ft . That gave him an astonishing 17-point margin over Ploc , who scored closer to the tenth-place jumper than he did to Nykanen . It confirmed the suspicion that % there are two classes of jumpers in the world today : Nykanen and everyone else . Said his coach , Matti Pulli : " He is the best jumper in the past 100 years , the best ever in the world . " The coach then added matter-of-factly , " Matti was jumping normally today , nothing more than that . He can jump farther . " <P> The " Flying Finn " is probably the most single-minded and obsessive jumper as well as the best . Nykanen first slid off the roof of his childhood home at 7 , got his first skis two years later , and did more jumps at 12 than most of his competitors do now . " When I met him , Matti was making 3,000 to 4,000 jumps a year , " said Paavo Komi , a professor who worked with the budding star in his native Jyvaskyla . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in contrast to 3,000 to 4,000 for most jumpers . " Part of this is the dogged will to win . The rest , Nykanen says , is pure joy : " You must experience the feeling . It feels like flying . " <P> Since 1981 , when he won his first international junior championship , the flashy Finn has piled up 1,479 World Cup points , some 400 more than the nearest competitor . At Sarajevo , he won gold in the 90 meter and silver in the 70 meter . <P> Typically , Nykanen shows superb sail but flawed form . On takeoff his arms may flail , and in landing he often misses the perfect telemark position : back straight and knees bent , with one leg considerably in front of the other . But these faults stem from his unique method of reading and reacting to the wind , sacrificing grace for distance . The antistyle may also owe something to Nykanen 's fierce personality and determination to do everything his own way . At any rate , it does not seem to cost him style @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than perfect form , presumably because the greatest ski jumper in the world should not be put down on narrow aesthetic grounds .
