In an extraordinary burst of democratic brainstorming , the American political system has generated hundreds of plans for a nuclear arms freeze , including the one that is before the House . While vague in their details and varying in their language , all convey the same message : enough is enough . <P> The freeze movement reflects a populist impatience both with the arms race and with the traditional arms control that has failed to stop " the madness . " Rather than running faster or haggling over rules for the next lap , say the freeze advocates , the superpowers should simply stop where they are . No more new nuclear weapons on either side , period . <P> The sentiment is understandable , but in the view of many nuclear experts , the proposed solution is impractical and unwise . While most freeze resolutions call for measures that are " mutual and verifiable , " a comprehensive freeze , almost by definition , would meet neither of those criteria . If the U.S. agreed to suspend all production of new nuclear weapons , then congressional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure that the ban was observed . There would be no similar self-policing in the secrecy-shrouded , security-obsessed U.S.S.R. Also , it would be extremely difficult for American intelligence agencies to monitor Soviet compliance with a ban on production , as opposed to deployment , of new weapons . <P> But the far greater problem would be reconciling the simplicity of the freeze concept with the complexities of maintaining true mutuality and stability in the U.S.-Soviet nuclear competition . Despite President Reagan 's alarmism about the Soviets ' supposed across-the-board " margin of superiority , " the U.S. and the Soviet Union are in a relationship variously described as parity , rough equivalence , or " offsetting asymmetries . " The Soviets are ahead in some categories , while the U.S. is ahead in others . But parity is not a static condition ; it is dynamic . It is subject to shifting trends in areas that on the Soviet side could not , and on the American side should not , be frozen . <P> For some years , the Soviets have been building up a sizable , potentially destabilizing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warheads . The U.S. is seeking to preserve a balance by modernizing the land-and sea-based legs of its strategic triad with the MX and the submarine-launched Trident II missiles . The Soviets are constantly improving their formidable antiaircraft defenses . That makes it harder for U.S. bombers , the airborne leg of the triad , to be sure of getting to their targets . That , in turn , makes it all the more important that the U.S. develop two types of weapons : a new , faster , " penetrating " bomber , like the B-1 or Stealth ; and cruise missiles , which can sneak in under Soviet air defenses . <P> Yet the new American weapons-the MX , the Trident II , new bombers and cruise missiles-would all be canceled by a freeze , while the Soviet offensive inventory and defensive network would not be affected .
