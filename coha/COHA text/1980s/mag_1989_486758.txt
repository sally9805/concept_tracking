My dentist ? Sweeney Todd , D.D.S. ? had his receptionist phone me to say that I should come in for an appointment . I figured Sweeney was having cash-flow problems again . " What is it this time ? " I asked the receptionist . " He says that he was looking at your X-rays , and you need a crown in the lower left something or other , " she said . " I do n't mean what is it with me , " I said . " What is it with him ? Did the kid 's college tuition bill just come in ? Wife redecorate the rumpus room ? Would you mind just shouting back there and asking him how much he owes for what ? I 'd like to get myself prepared . " " I ca n't , " the receptionist said . " He 's in the Caribbean until next Tuesday . " " I was afraid of something like this , " I said . " Before he left he gave me a list of patients to call , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need you for an hour on the first appointment . " " An hour on the first appointment ? " I said . " Sounds like Jamaica . Or maybe Antigua . This is definitely no cheapie to the Bahamas . That time he went to the Bahamas he only needed me for a half-hour session with the dental hygienist . May I ask if he took the wife and kids ? " " And his in-laws , " the receptionist said . " Erghh , " I said , with some feeling . " I think we 're talking gold crown here . Maybe even root canal . That mother-in-law of his lives high off the hog . " I showed up for the hour appointment anyway . What 's the alternative ? I do n't think I 'm up to auto-dentistry . I ca n't imagine myself bellying up to the mirror , opening my mouth wide , and saying , " Is it just my imagination , or does that bicuspid look a little shaky ? " I could switch dentists , of course , but I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listen closely while he 's working on your teeth  --  you have to listen closely because , being rather clumsy , he makes a lot of noise banging around the instruments ? you can hear him mumbling about whatever expense in the Todd family it was that got you into the chair in the first place . After years of that , I suppose I 'd feel something was missing if a dentist did n't accompany his drilling with a lot of talk about how much electricianscharge for a simple rewiring job these days . Besides , I do n't know any other dentists . I do n't admit that to Sweeney Todd , D.D.S. , of course . In fact , I 've been telling him for years that some friends of mine are always singing the praises of the dentist they all go to ? a relatively recent arrival from Kyoto known to his grateful patients as Magic Fingers Yamamoto . " They say he 's got the touch of an angel , " I said of Yamamoto , as I settled into the chair and prepared myself for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had to raise my voice a bit , since Sweeney , in his effort to recover a mirror he had dropped , had knocked the rest of his instruments onto the floor . " Open wide , please , " Sweeney said . He has never been affected in the slightest by talk of Magic Fingers Yamamoto . " Also , Yamamoto belongs to some Buddhist sect that believes the exchange of large sums of money corrupts the soul , " I continued . " For crowns and bridges , he does wonders with the same material used for the common paper clip . His fees , of course , are nominal . Basically , he seeks his rewards in inner fulfillment . He spits on money  --  or he would if he were n't so polite . " " Spit , please , " Sweeney said . Sweeney had stopped his banging around and was standing next to his instrument cabinet peering at some X-rays . " What do you see there , Sweeney ? " I asked . " A new transmission for your BMW ? A long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held the X-rays up to the window to get a better look . " Wo n't be able to get away for the next few weekends , " Sweeney said . " We 're doing an addition to the kitchen . " " You never cease to amaze me , Sweeney , " I said . " I 've seen those television commercials that show doctors seeing all sorts of little bitty doodads through the miracle of CAT scans ? or not seeing them , really , because all of the patients in those commercials turn out to be O.K. ? but you 've got to be the only medical man who can look at an X-ray with your naked eye and see an addition to your kitchen . What 's your secret ? " " I have a better X-ray machine , " Sweeney said , knocking over a water glass as he turned toward me . " But it 's expensive . Very expensive . Open wide , please .
