Profiting from the Navy <P> Admiral Hyman Rickover may be in retirement , but his torpedo-like salvos against shipbuilders who rip off American taxpayers are still exploding . About six months before he finally left the Navy in January 1982 after 59 years of cantankerous service , Rickover , now 83 , blasted four contractors in particular for making what he called " excessive profits " on their work for the Navy . A House committee asked the General Accounting Office , which is the investigative arm of Congress , to find out whether Rickover was right . <P> Last week a GAO report declared that the admiral 's numbers were essentially on target . Not even the contractors seriously disputed his statistics . The GAO 's only quibble was that it could not flatly call the profits " excessive " because " there are no generally accepted criteria as to what constitutes excess profits . " The four in stances cited by Rickover and verified by the GAO : <P> &gt; Boston 's Cabot Corp . had supplied special material used in making large valves for nuclear-propelled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 66% profit on this contract . The GAO estimate was only slightly lower , 61.3% . <P> &gt; Pittsburgh 's U:S . Steel Corp . had supplied high-pressure air flasks for Trident submarines under contracts that carried built-in profits of between 27% and 38% , according to both Rickover and the GAO . <P> &gt; New York State 's Carborundum Co. had sold the chemical boron carbide to two prime contractors that were building nuclear reactor cores . Rickover said the company had made a 25% profit on these sales . The GAO agreed . <P> &gt; Virginia 's Newport News Shipbuilding &; Dry Dock Co. had done repair work on seven nuclear-powered attack submarines . The GAO agreed with Rickover that the company 's profits had reached as high as 37% on one job and averaged 21.7% for all seven . <P> The companies insisted that special factors , such as stringent Government specifications and inspections and the heavy investment required to produce items in limited demand , had justified their high return . Rickover had contended that a 1934 law that limits profits on renegotiated Government contracts to 10% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was a proper gauge of a generous profit . <P> Navy Secretary John Lehman suggested that both Rickover and the GAO were wrong . " This Administration disagrees with Admiral Rickover 's idea that there is something wicked about profits , " he said . " We want our contractors to make a nice solid profit . "
