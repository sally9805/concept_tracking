One of them gets close to  --  43  --  Doc , an obvious soft touch , drools on him . Rock ca n't eat anyway , so he throws his lobster tail over the guy 's head , go , get it . This confuses the two drunks . One of them lurches around looking for the lobster tail , finds it , dives down to get it . The other guy , knowing he ca n't get to it in time , picks up a giant rock off the beach , raising it high in the shadows . We see it coming down somewhere in the vicinity of the first beggar 's head . All this seen faintly in the dark . The wash of the waves on the beach eclipsing it .

They 're looking over unfriendly . One of them , RHINOCEROS , is older ( in his 40 's ) , meaner and stupider than all of them . He is evidently the leader , a former National Guard Sergeant cashiered out for rape and murder . Boyle whispering to Maria to cool it out . She says something to Carlos but he does n't hear . Launches into another refrain from the song . The four guys at the table huddle among themselves . The girls look real poisonously at Carlos .
