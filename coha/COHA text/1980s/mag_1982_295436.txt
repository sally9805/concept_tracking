Going too far under cover <P> Last November at Bacon 's , a department store outside Louisville , the store detective nabbed a man she thought was about to steal $157 worth of clothing . He said his name was Pat Salamone and produced a driver 's license as identification . Louisville police booked Salamone and discovered that he was actually Patrick Livingston , a local FBI agent . <P> As part of an FBI sting operation from 1977 until 1980 , Livingston used the alias " Pat Salamone " while masquerading as a Miami pornography distributor . He hobnobbed with gangsters , buying their smut , counterfeit Hollywood films and even 50 submachine guns . The sting ended in 54 arrests , but for Livingston the charade had become muddled with reality . He kept bank accounts in his pseudonym and introduced himself regularly as Pat Salamone . According to Fred Schwartz , the Assistant U.S. Attorney prosecuting the sting defendants , Livingston has " psychiatric problems that make it difficult for him to distinguish between his real identity and his undercover identity . " <P> Livingston @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had submerged himself into the fantasy , and went to a psychiatrist . His friendships dissolved ; he separated from his wife . <P> An FBI agent for twelve years , Livingston was especially adept at undercover work , frequently risking death . Says William Brown , his attorney and an old friend : " Anyone who lives the extremely stressful five years that Pat has lived will manifest the stress in some manner . The FBI has had no program to prepare agents for living a schizophrenic life . " <P> Ten of the sting 's targets have been convicted so far . Some of the other defendants cite Livingston 's seeming mental problems in their defense . The shoplifting charges against Livingston were dropped , and he is now posted to the FBI office in Chicago . He returns periodically to Miami to testify against his dupes .
