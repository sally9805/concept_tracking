Transit officials spent the weekend preparing plans to get commuters to work by private and public buses and other rail lines in the event of a strike . Metro-North carries 80 , 000 riders a day and NJ Transit carries 75 , 000 a day , // Members of the United Transportation Union in both states , who have been working without a contract since Jan. 1 , have threatened to halt service at 12 : 01 A.M. tomorrow. // The rail lines were taken over from Conrail , a Federal agency , by the state authorities on Jan. 1 . With the exception of the United Transportation Union , all of the major unions involved have reached agreements with the new management . The disputes between the United Transportation Union and the state authorities center on differences over working hours and the size of crews. // The heads of union locals in both states said they had twice put off a strike and were not inclined to do so again . " We ' re not making any headway , " William Beebe , who represents the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which runs the Harlem , Hudson and New Haven lines , will find information about optional travel plans on their seats this morning , according to Arthur G. Perfall , assistant executive director of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority , the parent agency of Metro-North . <> <> ' Tuesday Will Be Too Late ' // " We ' re hoping it doesn ' t come to a strike , " Mr. Perfall said yesterday . " But to give out contingency information Tuesday morning will be too late. " // Contingency plans for NJ Transit were released last night . A spokesman for the agency , Richard Mariani , said that copies of the plan would be distributed to riders during tonight ' s rush hour. // Officials in both states said the alternative plans would accommodate only a small number of the tens of thousands of commuters involved. // In New Jersey , Governor Kean accused the union of violating an agreement to give the statewide transportation agency at least seven days notice before a strike. // " The proposed action by the United Transportation Union workers , and their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notice of a strike , carries the threat of hardship and grave economic consequences for thousands of working people , " the Governor said. // Jim Weinstein , a spokesman for NJ Transit , said " the surprising and abrupt strike threat " would make contingency plans more difficult to organize. // However , union officials said the threat of a strike was nothing new , since negotiations to reach a new contract have been going on since late last year. // L.W. Swert , general chairman of the New Jersey local of the United Transportation Union , said , " We sincerely regret the great inconvenience which we fully realize will be suffered by the public. " // An earlier strike deadline of Jan. 1 was averted when the unions agreed to keep working while negotiations continued . On Saturday , the 600 members of the New Jersey United Transportation Union local authorized a strike after rejecting a management offer that had been accepted by the union negotiating team . <> <> Cites 2 Earlier Extensions // Mr. Beebe , who represents the union ' s 541 members on Metro-North @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He said that he had extended the strike deadline twice since Jan. 1 , but that no further extensions would be granted because the talks had " deteriorated " in recent months. // Arvid Anderson , who headed a Presidential board that originally made recommendations for settling the dispute , is continuing to serve as a mediator and is planning to confer with representatives of the two sides in the New York dispute today when they meet at offices of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority , at 347 Madison Avenue . But he said he was not optimistic about a further extension for any lengthy period. // The railroad has sought in the negotiation to eliminate what Richard Ravitch , chairman of the M.T.A. , calls antiquated and costly work rules . One goal has been to reduce the work force by eliminating rigid requirements for the number of conductors and assistants on a train. // But union officials view this objective as a threat to the jobs of their members that could result in as many as 151 layoffs , according to Edward J. Yule , who is representing the parent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours of work . The railroad would like conductors , trainmen and their assistants to work over a 12-hour span for 10 hours pay each day , with a break of as much as four hours in midday . This would make it possible for the same crews to work during both the morning and evening commuter rushes . The union , on the other hand , is seeking an eight-hour day at the rate of time and onehalf pay for any hours worked beyond eight. // In the event of a strike Tuesday morning , NJ Transit and Metro-North have set up special arrangements for commuters . Officials say these arrangements will be for rush periods only . <> <> Metro-North // Hudson Line : Buses to subway stations in the Bronx will pick up passengers at Cold Spring , Croton-Harmon , Ossining , Tarrytown and Scarborough. // Harlem Line : Buses to Bronx subway stops will leave from stations at Mount Kisco , Chappaqua , Pleasantville , North White Plains , Scarsdale and Bronxville. // New Haven Line : Buses to the Bronx will leave from stations at Westport @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Rye , Port Chester , Harrison and Larchmont. // For further information , passengers in Westchester , Putnam and Dutchess Counties can call ( 800 ) 522-5624 ; in New York City , 532-4900 and in Connecticut , ( 800 ) 223-6052 . <> <> NJ Transit // Northeast Corridor Line : From Trenton to New York , shuttle service will be provided from the Lawrence Shopping Center in Lawrence Township , Rutgers Stadium in Piscataway , Metropark in Edison and the Metuchen train station .
