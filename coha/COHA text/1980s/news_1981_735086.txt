txt Some people have never forgiven the federal government for trying to bring its intelligence agencies Under the rule of law . The Wall Street Journal , for example , recently launched an attack on the Justice Department 's guidelines covering domestic intelligence investigation The newspaper complained in an editorial that Under the rules an " agent runs legal risks if he investigates a suspected potential terrorist , assassin , or spy without cause sufficient to satisfy a courtroom definition . " And it went on to say that the Justice Department rules require ' probable cause ' to suspect that a crime has been committed or is about to be committed before the FBI can investigate potential wrongdoers . " Domestic intelligence investigations often aim at political groups . This makes them sensitive , because of the 1st Amendment 's protection of free speech . And here is always the possibility that someone will open an investigation of a group simply because he disagrees with its politics . Rules , therefore , are in order The Wall Street Journal ought to realize that an agent will run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not there are guidelines in place . The guidelines are , ineffect , a protection They tell agents precisely what they may do This is one reason that the FBI supports the guidelines The Wall Street Journal also has a misconception about what the rules require ' Probable cause " is a phrase with a rather precise legal definition It is a rather high standard of proof II appears nowhere in the guidelines To open even the most vigorous investigation , the FBI need only have " specific and articulable facts giving reason to believe " an ind ? vidual or group is or may be engaged in a violation of federal law Lower level investigations may be opened on the basis of even less evidence This is not just a matter of splitting hairs with our fellow journalists in New York The difference between probable cause and reasonable suspicion is the difference between the evidence it takes in ordinary criminal cases to make an arrest and the evidence it takes to stop and frisk someone on the street If the Wall Street Journal wants to attack the guidelines that establish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it ought at least to take the trouble to find out what the words of the law mean .
