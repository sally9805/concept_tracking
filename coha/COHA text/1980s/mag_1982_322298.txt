Investigating the investigators <P> In January 1981 , days after President Reagan 's Inauguration , the FBI 'S second-ranking official appeared before a Senate committee to assure its members that they could go ahead with Raymond Donovan 's confirmation as Secretary of Labor . FBI agents , he testified , had found nothing unsavory in Donovan 's business dealings as a construction executive , despite the rumors of underworld connections . One troubled Senator asked if the investigation might not have been more thorough . No , replied Executive Assistant FBI Director Francis Mullen , " I do not know what else we could have done . " <P> As it turned out , there was a lot the FBI could and should have done . It could have informed the committee , as it did White House Counsel Fred Fielding , that underworld informants had linked Donovan with known mobsters . In addition , FBI agents could have pursued other suggestive leads . They did not until months later , TIME has learned , because Mullen ordered his investigators to ease off Donovan , with what a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ House aides . Mullen , now acting director of the Drug Enforcement Administration , says the charges against Donovan were too " nebulous , way out " and " nonspecific . " Thus , during the 1981 committee deliberations , according to a top FBI official , Mullen told subordinates : " We 've reached the point where we 've got to cut it off and move forward . " After Mullen 's dictum , the official said , " the amount of follow-up investigation of the leads was minimal , " and evidence unfavorable to Donovan in FBI files in New York City and Newark was left buried . <P> Mullen had told the Senators flatly that " there is no information available to the FBI which indicates that " Donovan or his Schiavone Construction Co. were " mobbed up . " At the time , many committee members were skeptical , and Mullen admits his testimony may have been too " positive " and " sweeping . " With last week 's more serious claims that Mullen chose not to ferret out more damaging allegations against Donovan , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Missouri Democrat Thomas Eagleton , a member of the Labor and Human Resources Committee : " The aroma is so pungent that I think there will be hearings . " <P> Of even keener interest than Mullen 's role is why the White House agreed to the curtailment of the FBI 's probe of Donovan . The day before the Labor Secretary 's confirmation hearings began , an FBI official telephoned Fielding and informed him of " a tape recording " linking Donovan socially with " hoodlums . " Fielding insists that he passed along all important information to his superiors , but says the White House was not fazed by the unsubstantiated charges . Counters one senior presidential adviser : " Fred was the only one directly in touch with the FBI investigation . "
