In the beginning , it was a tale of two goaltenders - one who was playing in his 18th consecutive NHL game and one who was playing in his first NHL game . One , the Bruins ' rookie , Jim Stewart , was shaken by a five- goal first period . The other , Mike Liut of St. Louis , was battered by 1001 shots but survived as the Blues won , 7-4 , last night at the Garden . A crowd of 12,066 saw the Blues score on their first shot of the game and continue on to a rollicking first period and spoil what had started out as a bright day for Stewart , beginning with the call that brought him up to the Bruins . It began as an unforgettable night for Stewart , out of Hudson and Holy Cross . The first shot he saw turned into one he couldn ' t see , and after his first 20 minutes , Stewart had allowed five goals . It was a period in which things went from bad to worse for the Bruins . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at 1:08 . It was a 50- foot slap shot from the left point , and it whistled past Stewart ' s left shoulder . It was only the beginning . Bernie Federko finished off a 2-on-1 jump by pulling Stewart toward him at the left post and putting the puck behind him at 2:55 . The Bruins didn ' t help their young goalie very much on that play . With Bobby Lalonde doing some hard work along the boards behind the goal , Al Secord cut the lead in half . Lalonde put the puck on Secord ' s stick as he came to the top right of the crease . Secord snapped his shot by Liut ' s right . Mike Crombeen restored St. Louis ' two-goal lead at 3:46 when he knocked a backhander through Stewart ' s legs from the top left of the crease . The pattern was now established . The Bruins would have to play offensive hockey - accepting all the risk of that kind of game . They got their second goal from Stan Jonathan after a sequence that saw Jean Ratelle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ save . After a faceoff in the right circle , Ratelle passed to Rick Middleton in the slot . He fired , Liut saved and Jonathan pounced on the rebound and drove it through Liut ' s legs . Stewart finally got a hand from the crowd on a St. Louis power play when he got his glove on a strong shot from the slot by Sutter . It was only a momentary reprieve , for the Blues would get two more goals before the longest period in Stewart ' s life ended . Sutter scored his second goal of the period when he slapped the puck through Stewart ' s legs from the middle of the left circle at 15:27 . And at 16:42 , Crombeen scored his second of the period , swiping at his own reboundfrom the right , with John Wensink on his back , and hitting it past Stewart . With 21 seconds left in the period , Bobby Lalonde skated in on Liut on a breakaway , but the St. Louis goalie blocked Lalonde ' s initial shot . Liut was out of position and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hit the right post and Lalonde grimaced . The play produced an Ed Kea hooking call and at the end of the period , Ray Bourque had a good wrist shot from the slot that went in . However , the green light had gone on to end the period , and the goal did not count . In a merciful move , Bruin coach Fred Creighton replaced Stewart with another rookie goalie , Marco Baron , at the start of the second period . The Bruins gave Baron stronger protection in a very basic way - they kept the puck at the other end of the ice . It didn ' t help too much , because Liut made one good save after another and didn ' t give up a goal until there were just 26 seconds left in the period . Larry Patey had upped the St. Louis lead to 6-2 with a breakaway goal at 13:43 . The Bruins continued to press , and Secord finally got his second goal of the game at 19:34 on a slap shot from the top of the left circle by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steady pressure on Liut , making him jump around to get his body in front of shots . He stuck his glove in front of others while effectively frustrating the Bruins . The Boston goal came after Ratelle and Mike Milbury had missed scoring chances , as Milbury got the puck in the right circle and passed it back to Secord , who had gone to the left point to protect Milbury while he was in the attacking zone .
