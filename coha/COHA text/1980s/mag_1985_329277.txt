" It was a hot , humid day and overcast , " recalled Yakub Ali , a 40-year-old farmer on the tiny Bangladeshi island of Urirchar . " First came the dark and the menacing clouds . Soon the wind started whistling ominously . Then the heavy rains began to fall . " At first Yakub thought with relief that the torrents might disperse the stifling heat , which can exceed 100 degrees F at this time of year . But the downpour quickly gained greater and still greater force . As the alarmed farmer walked out of his hut , he came upon his neighbors gathering in the night . There was frightened talk that Danger Signal No. 9 , a cyclone warning calling for immediate evacuation , had been announced on the radio . It was news to Yakub . <P> On the previous day , Indian meteorologists had alerted the Bangladesh government in Dhaka that a killer storm was sweeping toward the country 's myriad offshore islets and southern flatlands along the Bay of Bengal . Danger Signals Nos. 4 and 5 , warning of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the port of Chittagong , and fishermen and other sailors had been urged to stay close to the shore . Hourly warnings were broadcast on state-run radio and television , advising residents in the imperiled areas to seek shelter instantly . But most of the impoverished squatters who crowd the islets are too poor to own radios , and many of those who heard the warnings may have shrugged them off as a false alarm . <P> As wind and water gathered force , however , Yakub Ali knew that something ominous was on the way . Hurrying back to his homestead , he awoke his wife , his ten-year-old son and his younger brother and urged them to come along to Urirchar 's only concrete building , a two-story Forestry Department complex a little more than half a mile away . By then the tide had begun to rise . Yakub and his family started running ; all around them people were racing for safety . <P> A few minutes later , still hundreds of yards from the Forestry building , Yakub felt himself lifted by a towering wave . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was lost in the darkness , behind blinding sheets of rain . " Everything was dark  --  rain , rain . I was floating for several hours , " he recalled of the hours he passed at sea before sailors from a naval vessel pulled him to safety . " I am a good swimmer , but it was terrible . I really do not know how I survived . And where , " he asked , tears in his eyes , " where are my near and dear ones ? " <P> The same sad question haunted all of Urirchar after the night of the raging elements . While the sea crashed over the 20-sq. - mi. island , whose highest point is only 10 ft. above sea level , families were torn asunder . In desperation , people clung to the rafters of the Forestry Department building or to trees or to anything else not swept away by the terrifying storm . " I survived by holding on to a branch , " said Akmal Hossain , a 42-year-old farmer . " Everything happened after midnight , and before I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water engulfed the island . " By the time furious wind and swirling wave had passed , Hossain found that he had lost his wife , his daughter and his aged mother .
