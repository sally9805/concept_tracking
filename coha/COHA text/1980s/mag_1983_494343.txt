REAGAN 'S BANKRUPT BUDGET BY DANIEL PATRICK MOYNIHAN TN HIS FIRST thousand days in office Ronald Reagan 1 increased the national debt of the United States by half . If he should serve a second term , and the debt continues to mount as currently forecast by the Congressional Budget Office , the Reagan Administration will have nearly tripled the national debt . In eight years , one Republican Administration will have done twice , you might say , what it took 192 years and thirty-eight Federalist , Democratic , Whig , and Republican predecessors to do once . The numbers are so large they defy any ordinary effort at comprehension ( a billion minutes ago St. Peter was fourteen years dead ) , but for the record they are as follows . On President Reagan 's inauguration day , January 20 , 1981 , the national debt stood at $940.5 billion . In the next thirty-two months , $457 billion was added . The projected eight-year growth is $1.64 trillion , bringing us to a total debt , by 1989 , of $2.58 trillion . Debt service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will rise accordingly . It came to $75 billion in fiscal year 1980 . By the end of this fiscal year , it will be something like $148.5 billion . And so it might also be said that the Reagan Administration will have doubled the cost of the debt in four years . A law of opposites frequently influences the American Presidency . Once in office , Presidents are seen to do things least expected of them , often things they had explicitly promised not to do . Previous commitments or perceived inclinations act as a kind of insurance that protects against any great loss if a President behaves contrary to expectation . He is given the benefit of the doubt . He ca n't have wanted to do this or that ; he must have had to do it . President Eisenhower made peace , President Kennedy went to war ; President Nixon went to China . Something of this indulgence is now being granted President Reagan . Consider the extraordinary deficits , $200 billion a year , and continuing , in David Stockman 's phrase , as far as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debt ? the kind that leads the International Monetary Fund to take over a third world country 's economic affairs ( or in olden times would lead us to send in the Marines to collect customs duties ) ? is all happening without any great public protest , or apparent political cost . Daniel Patrick Moynihan , the senior United States Senator from New York , is a member of the Senate Finance and Budget Committees . As such , this need be no great cause for concern . If Ronald Reagan is lucky , good for him . There is little enough luck in the business . But , unfortunately , something much larger is at issue . If nothing is done , the debt and the deficit will virtually paralyze American national government for the rest of the decade . The first thing to be done , to use that old Marxist terminology , is to demystify the Reagan deficit . If I may say so , what I now write , I know . That is not and should not be enough for the reader . I will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proposition to be presented is coherent , and whether any other proposition makes more sense . The proposition is that the deficits were purposeful , that is to say , the deficits for the President 's initial budgets . They were thereafter expected to disappear . That they have not , and will not , is the result of a massive misunderstanding of American government . This is not understood in either party . Democrats feel uneasy with the subject , one on which we have been attacked since the New Deal . Republicans are simply uncomprehending , or , as Senator John Danforth of Missouri said in a speech on the debt ceiling in November ( referring to the whole Senate , but permit me an inference ) , " catatonic . " Start with the campaign . Although we may be forgiven if we remember otherwise , as a candidate , Mr. Reagan did not propose to reduce federal spending . Waste , yes , that would be eliminated , but name a program , at least one of any significance , that was to go . To the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That was the one program issue of his campaign . It was the peculiar genius of that campaign that it proposed to increase defense expenditures while cutting taxes . This was the Kemp-Roth proposal , based on Arthur Laffer 's celebrated curve . As a candidate , Mr. Reagan went so far as to assert that this particular tax cut would actually increase revenues . What follows is crucial : no one believed this . Obviously a tax can be so high that it discourages the taxed activity and reduces revenue . This is called price elasticity and is a principle that applies to pretty much everything from the price of THE NEW REPUBLIC to the price Justice Holmes said we pay for civilization . But any massive reduction in something as fundamental as the income tax was going to bring about a massive loss of revenue . And this was intended . There was a hidden agenda . It came out in a television speech sixteen days after President Reagan 's inauguration , when he stated , " There were always those who told us that taxes could n't be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can lecture our children about extravagance until we run out of voice and breath . Or we can cut their extravagance by simply reducing their allowance . " The President genuinely wanted to reduce the size of the federal government . He genuinely thought it was riddled with " waste , fraud , and abuse , " with things that need n't or should n't be done . He was astute enough to know there are constituencies for such activities , and he thought it pointless to try to argue them out of existence one by one . He would instead create a fiscal crisis in which , willy-nilly , they would be driven out of existence . I F HIS understanding of the government had been I right , his strategy for reducing its size would have been sound . But his understanding was desperately flawed . There is waste in the federal budget , but it is of the kind generic to large and long-established enterprises . Thus we have an Army , a Navy , and an Air Force . They compete , they overlap , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in no small measure because these uniforms mean something to those men and women , and have , in the case of the Army and Navy ( and of course the Marine Corps , which is part of the Navy ) for more than two centuries . A management consultant might merge them . I sure as hell would n't , except perhaps way at the top . For the rest , well , there is the F.B.I . at $1 billion ; the Coast Guard ( equally long established ) at $2.5 billion , and so on . Welfare ? In the sense of welfare mothers ? The Aid to Families with Dependent Children program comes in at about 1 percent of the whole budget . ( The Washington Post has half-seriously proposed that it be abolished altogether so that people will stop talking about it . ) There are areas in the budget where expenditure is indeed growing at enormous rates , principally that of medical care . But for the most part , and especially in the case of medical care , expenditure is growing at similar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social forces are at work , not simply a peculiarly pathological tendency of government . A notable area of miscalculation , or rather misinformation , among the Reaganites was that of foreign affairs . President Reagan has acted much as his predecessors have done in foreign affairs , and for the elemental reason that he is faced with much the same situations . Invariably , this has meant spending money . This fall the President had to plead with Congress to increase appropriations for the International Monetary Fund , something he can not have expected ever to be doing , but there you are . As I write , the Kissinger Commission on Central America is no doubt drawing up a massive " Marshall Plan " for the area . Is there any doubt that in the next session the President will be pleading with Congress to increase this particular form of foreign aid ? ( Just as , had his supporters in the Senate been successful in blocking the Panama Canal treaties in the Carter years , he would be pleadingtoday with the Senate to consent to their ratification . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reduction in history ? became law in August 1981 . Critics , if they are members of Congress , typically must begin by explaining why they voted for the tax cut . I am one . ( There were only eleven Senators who voted no . ) I have an explanation , but no excuse . After years of intense inflation and the accompanying " bracket creep " in the income tax , we did need to reduce personal tax rates . A year earlier , the Senate Finance Committee , controlled by the Democratic majority , had reported out just such a bill , but Mr. Carter 's White House would not hear of it . This helped lose the Senate for the Democrats , but the lesson was not lost . The great recession of 1981-82 made it painfully clear that the tax cut was too small for the first year , when a neoKeynesian stimulus was in order . At the time , however , a bidding war broke out in the House , sending the parties into senseless competition to offer loopholes to special interests . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later years . Thus the $200 billion annual deficit . Again , no excuses from this quarter , but in the Democratic response to the President 's televised speech of July 27 , 1981 , I did say , " In the last few days something like an auction of the Treasury has been going on . . . what this is doing is taking a tax cut we could afford and transforming it into a great barbecue that we ca n't afford . I would say to the President that some victories come too dear . " E NTER THE Federal Reserve Board which looked at the huge tax cuts in the midst of high inflation and decided to create an economic downturn . Of all the structural anomalies of American government , the arrangements for setting macroeconomic policy are the most perverse . Although fiscal policy ( the amounts of money the government spends , receives , and borrows ) is made through a painfully elaborate public process by an elected President and an elected Congress , monetary policy ( the total amount of money in the economy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by appointed officials . The Reserve Board tightened the grOwth of the money supply so strenuously that it actually declined in the third quarter of 1981 . Real interest rates reached the highest levels in our nation 's history , and the economy fell off the cliff . At the end of September 1981 , the steel industry was operating at 74.5 percent of capacity ; by the end of 1982 , it was operating at 29.8 percent of capacity . To be sure , the Fed does not control the precise money supply and can not precisely determine interest rates . But it can set the direction and range for both , and this it did . Anyone who tried to dissent was soundly rapped . Its two dozen or so central bankers decided to bust the economy , and bust it they did . In a White House appearance in October 1982 , Nobel Economist George Stigler used the term " depression " to describe the economy . There is a tendency for any government to live beyond its income . The Reagan Administration transformed this temptation from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reagan , big government became a bargain . For seventy-five cents worth of taxes , you got one dollar 's worth of return . Washington came to resemble a giant discount house . If no tax would balance the budget , and no outlay would make it any worse , why try ? A boom psychology moved through government . Defense came first , from space wars to battleships ? the latest defense appropriation reactivates the World War II-vintage U.S.S. Missouri . Hog wild is the only way to describe the farm program . Jimmy Carter left behind a $4 billion enterprise , somewhat overpriced at that and the object of incessant right-wing criticism . Whereupon the fundamentalists and their political brethren took over . Within thirty-six months they increased the annual cost of the farm program more than fourfold . Their most recent enthusiasm , signed into law by President Reagan , is a program paying dairy farmers not to milk their cows . HAT IS to be done ? The economy is at stake . The WHA can bankrupt itself . According to the latest budget projections , prepared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ director , Rudolph G. Penner ( formerly of the American Enterprise Institute ) , the deficit for the six years 1984 to 1989 will come to approximately $1,339,000,000,000 . In order to support and service this debt , the government will have to absorb more and more of the capital that is coming available in the nation 's credit markets . Direct federal borrowing for the deficit and federally guaranteed loans absorbed 62 percent of all credit raised on the nation 's financial markets this year , compared to an average absorption rate of 8.3 percent in the 1960s and 15.3 percent in the 1970s . This " crowding out " was not much felt , because few others were borrowing to invest . But when the day comes that business , consumers , and government all compete for the same funds , interest rates will go up , with predictable consequences . Under these circumstances , the only thing a Republican Administration and a Republican Senate will be able to consider doing will be to revert to their original agenda : use the budget deficit to force massive reductions in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cite not mere illusions but necessity . Even if interest on the debt climbs to $200 billion a year , as now seems likely , presumably there will still be an Army , an F.B.I. , and some kind of customs service and border control . What then will be left to cut ? Entitlements , or more precisely , Social Security . The word is already the rage . There is scarcely a Republican member of the Senate who does not know that entitlements must be cut , and cut deeply . Many Democrats agree ; almost none dissent . Remember , at least twenty Senators are millionaires , living at considerable social distance from those who would be most affected . It will be much the same in the House . The budget deficit in the year ahead will threaten any sustained recovery . The members of the House , as a rule , arenot millionaires , but they know their street corners . The street corners will say , " Cut . Something must be done . " Cut back Social Security in desperation , and you abandon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ society . This promise , once broken , will fracture a little bit of society . ( Moreover , cutting Social Security will not improve the deficit problem . As Martin Feldstein , chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers , has noted , Social Security is funded by separate payroll taxes and contributes not a cent to the deficit . ) There is an alternative . There is the possibility of a historic compromise that can bring the now dominant branch of the Republican Party to grips with reality , while shaking the now dominant branch of the Democratic Party from its illusion that no one will listen to Republicans for very long . Such a compromise can not await a change in the political culture . It must be negotiated . We need a structure , a forum in which negotiations can take place . A Presidential commission might be such a structure . The National Commission on Social Security Reform ? on which I served ? would provide a model . It was established by President Reagan in December 1981 , after Congress rejected his original plan to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is crucial . Alan Greenspan , who chaired the commission , adopted a simple rule : each member was entitled to his own opinion but not his own facts . Within a year Mr. Greenspan had established the facts , which showed that the problem was neither trivial nor hopeless . The commission as such could reach no agreement . But with the facts established , we put together a bipartisan legislative package last January in exactly twelve days . rr HE BUDGET CRISIS presents a harder problem , but it can be approached in the same way . Martin Feldstein made a good beginning in a speech to the Southern Economic Association on November 21 . He agreed with the Congressional Budget Office that by 1988 the deficit will absorb 5.1 percent of the nation 's G.N.P . Of this , Feldstein noted , 2.4 percent will come from increased defense spending , 1.7 percent from the tax cut , and the remaining 1 percent from higher interest payments . The facts about the structural deficit flow readily from such quantification . The members of the budget commission ? representatives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Congressional Budget Office ? would determine the actual effects of deficits on employment , real interest rates , capital formation , investment , and the prospects for vigorous economic growth . Then they would propose the steps to reduce the deficit , making certain that the burden of these reductions did not fall disproportionately on any economic or social group . Delaying tax indexing , reforming corporate tax law deductions and credits , cutting defense spending , and reducing farm price supports , among other proposals , would have to be considered . Medicare , secure in the short term , will be in deep trouble before the end of this decade . The deficit commission must face up to this problem . Democrats should agree to do so in return for assurances that the Social Security agreement will be respected and that the Social Security trust fund will not be raided ( the plain purpose of those who say entitlements are the problem ) . Moreover , a solution to the deficit crisis will require more than adjustments in spending and taxation . It will demand change in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way those policies are coordinated . Monetary policy and the operations of the Federal Reserve must be an integral part of any fiscal resolution . Nothing can be achieved without a joint monetary-fiscal effort to promote an expanding economy and an approach to full employment ? a one percentage point drop in unemployment alone reduces the budget deficit by $30 billion . But let 's stop here . I have my own thoughts . The reader will have his or hers . On the final day of the last session of Congress , I introduced legislation to establish the National Commission on Deficit Reduction . Now , can we get the President to join ?
