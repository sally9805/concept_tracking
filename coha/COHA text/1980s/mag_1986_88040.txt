The Statue of Liberty marks the exact geographical center of an area that was officially designated the Port of New York by an act of Congress in 1921 . One would hope that Congress placed her there for reasons as historic and romantic as they were commercial and political , but it really does n't matter : The fact that the grand old Lady of Liberty stands at bull's-eye center of a 25-mile-radius bistate circle covered by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey also puts her , for sure , right in the middle of the most consistently action-packed and hope-filled place in all of American history . // That place is New York Harbor . // The harbor is perfect because , standing as she does in the heaving , lovely , sunny , stormy , lively , killing , promise-filled , polluted , enriching , tumultuous , life-giving , moneymaking , hope-inspiring waters of New York Harbor , the Statue of Liberty is also located dead center in the heart of the American dream . And in the heart of American commerce and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ folly and American heroism . New York Harbor has seen it all . // New York Harbor has served it all . New York Harbor has been it all . // From before the Civil War until the late 1970s , New York was the No. 1 port in the U.S. It has recently fallen to third place , behind the ports of Los Angeles and Houston . Nevertheless , New York had its busiest year ever in 1985 , handling 51.3 million long tons of ocean-borne foreign trade worth almost $49 billion , plus almost a million tons of overseas air cargo valued at about $43 billion . It was the harbor , of course , that led to New York 's becoming the financial capital of the world , and the cultural and communications capital of the U.S. , if not the world . The harbor itself , which includes the Upper and Lower bays , the Hudson and East rivers as far north as mid-Manhattan , as well as several other feeder waterways ( see map , page 33 ) , has influenced human life in countless other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is particularly fitting that Liberty Weekend , July 3-6 , celebrating the Statue of Liberty 's centennial , comes at a time when the harbor is at an important turning point . // In recent years most of the 17 million people in the Greater New York area have turned their backs on the harbor , considering it little more than a cesspool . Now , spurred on by recent happenings , such as the 1976 bicentennial celebration and the 100th birthday party for the Brooklyn Bridge in 1983 , increasing numbers of people are gaining new appreciation for the harbor . Next week 's party should be the topper . Most of the other activity around the harbor is less spectacular though more enduring , and could help reverse decades of neglect and decline : the creation of the Gateway National Recreation Area , consisting of shore holdings stretching from Sandy Hook to Jamaica Bay and maintained by the National Park Service ; the opening of the South Street Seaport ; the defeat last year of the Westway project , a proposed multibillion-dollar highway and real estate development that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ striped bass ; the first steps in revitalizing 18 miles of ramshackle New Jersey waterfront ; and the opening of sewage-treatment plants like the massive one between 135th and 145th Streets in Manhattan , not far from the Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center . That one plant treats 150 million gallons of sewage a day . Until last April , that sewage had poured raw into the Hudson for decades and had included whatever anyone might flush down a toilet or wash down a drain in a hospital operating room , garage , tenement , restaurant , chemistry lab , factory , abattoir or penthouse. // This is not to put too fine a sheen on the present state of the harbor . You ca n't eat its striped bass because the fish spend a lot of time in the Hudson and are contaminated by PCBs that General Electric was allowed to dump upriver for years until it was made to stop in 1976. // After a storm , the runoff from sidewalks , gutters and streets gushes into the harbor .

The Army Corps of Engineers runs three collection vessels to scoop up the flotsam and jetsam : Besides the occasional corpse , these have included a grand piano and a dead giraffe. // Despite the abuse , the harbor continues to be a magnet for an incredible array of fish and wildlife and , of course , people , who , though neglectful at times , seem determined not to let this living treasure die . // When George Washington was president , and New York City the young nation 's capital , he fished in the harbor . The fish , known as spots elsewhere along the Atlantic coast , were called Lafayettes in New York , because enormous numbers of them ran into the harbor when the Marquis de Lafayette , who led a band of American soldiers to victory over the British in the Yorktown campaign , paid his farewell visit in 1824. // As a boy , Bernard Baruch caught soft-shell crabs in the Harlem River , one of the waterways that feed the harbor . // Aaron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duel in Weehawken on the Jersey side of the Hudson . // John James Audubon painted quadrupeds while living on a 24-acre estate he called Minnie 's Land ( Minnie was his wife 's nickname ) , which overlooked the Hudson from upper Manhattan . // Edgar Allan Poe , who was expelled from West Point , 50 miles up the Hudson from Manhattan , and invented detective fiction , patterned one story after Mary Cecilia Rogers , a beautiful girl who worked for a New York City tobacconist and disappeared . She was found dead , floating in the Hudson . Her killer was never discovered , but Poe took the incident , set it in Paris , changed the Hudson to the Seine and wrote The Mystery of Marie Rogt . Walt Whitman wrote a number of poems about the harbor , such as City of Ships and City of Orgies . // In exile from 1850 to 1854 , the Italian patriot Giuseppe Garibaldi worked as a candlemaker in Staten Island , where he lived for a year at the home of his employer and admirer , Antonio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public assistance . He enjoyed fishing in the harbor with Meucci , who rigged up a catboat with a sail he had painted in the Italian colors of red , white and green . Garibaldi also liked to hunt . Once while hunting he was arrested for allegedly violating an obscure local ordinance . His excited compatriots told the judge who Garibaldi was , and the judge dismissed the case . Garibaldi rebuked his friends , saying , " ... these officers of the law have done nothing more than their duty , and I deserved the correction . The Americans make and enforce the laws proper to the regulation of their own communities , just as we hope some day to do with ours in Italy . " // Herman Melville , deemed a failure as a writer , spent 19 years of his later life as a customs inspector on the Gansevoort Dock on the Hudson . He was glad to get the job ; it paid $4 a day .

Inlanders all , they come from lanes and alleys , streets and avenues  --  north , east , south , and west . Yet here they all unite . " Melville died in 1891 , unrecognized by the general public . His grave is in Woodlawn Cemetery in the Bronx , not far from that of Admiral David ( " Damn the torpedoes  --  full speed ahead ! " ) Farragut. // For several years Melville 's boss was Chester A.

In 1524 Verrazano dropped anchor below the Narrows and took a small boat into Upper New York Bay . A sudden storm forced him to turn back , but he reported that the region was " commodious and delightful . " In 1964 the new bridge between Brooklyn and Staten Island was named after him . // The explorer who put New York on the map was Henry Hudson . An English navigator hired by the Dutch East India Company in 1609 to find a passage to China , Hudson set sail on April 6 of that year from the Netherlands aboard the 80-ton Half Moon with a Dutch and English crew . After encountering ice along the coast of Norway , he turned southwest because Captain John Smith had suggested that China might be reached through North America . Upon arriving at Chesapeake Bay , Hudson moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sept. 4 he dropped anchor near Staten Island . Although his party encountered some hostile Indians , the passage looked promising , and the Half Moon entered the harbor and moved up the river later to bear Hudson 's name . By the time the Half Moon had sailed 130 miles , to the Albany area , Hudson began to suspect that the river was not the passage to China , and he turned back . Still , he wrote in his log , " The land is the finest for cultivation that I ever in my life set foot upon , and it also abounds in trees of every description . " // Dutch ships returned to trade for furs . The first settlers landed on Manhattan Island in 1624 , and two years later Peter Minuit bought the island from the Canarsie Indians for trinkets worth 60 guilders , about $24 . Manhattan was worth buying because it was , according to one Dutch account , " like a great natural pier ready to receive the commerce of the world . " The small settlement at the south end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entire colony , which ran up to Fort Orange , now Albany , was called New Netherland. // What is now Liberty Island was called Great Oyster Island by the Dutch ; Ellis Island was simply Oyster Island . Oyster beds covered an estimated 350 square miles of the harbor and environs . The yummiest oysters to the Dutch were those taken from the Gowanus Creek section of the East River ; the oysters grew to a foot in length . There were millions of soft-shell and hard-shell clams . The Indians used hard-shell clams to make wampumpeag ( shortened to wampum ) , literally a string of shell beads , valued as ornaments and for trade . The Dutch began making wampum themselves to trade for furs , mainly beaver pelts . Beaver hats were the fashion in Europe , as can be seen in portraits by Rembrandt , Rubens and Frans Hals . Beavers were so valuable the Dutch put one in the seal of New Netherland , and one remains today in the New York City seal .

Last May a 50-foot gray whale was found dead in the Hudson at 49th Street . Robbins Reef , near the Statue of Liberty , got its name from the seals , roben in Dutch , found there . // The Dutch found " a great plenty of sturgeon , " and today Atlantic sturgeon , up to 300 pounds or more , still come in from the ocean to spawn in the Hudson . So do shad . The Dutch considered striped bass not only good eating but probably an aphrodisiac as well because , according to Isaak de Rasieres , " It seems this fish makes the Indians lascivious ....

Adriaen Van der Donck wrote that " there are some persons who imagine that the animals of the country will be destroyed in time , but this is an unnecessary anxiety . " Jacob Steendam paid his homage in verse : // It is the land where milk and honey flow ; Where plants distilling perfume grow ; Where Aaron 's rod with budding blossoms blow ; A very Eden // In 1664 the English seized New Amsterdam and changed the names of both the town and the colony to New York in honor of the Duke of York , the brother of King Charles II , whose property it became . The English also gave the Hudson its name . ( To the Dutch , the Hudson had been the North River , and the Delaware the South River ) . The stretch of the Hudson that flows past Manhattan is still sometimes called the North River . // Even before the English seizure , buccaneers along the Spanish Main had begun calling the Dutch Yankees . The term was a combination of Jan and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stereotypical Dutchman was named Jan and ate cheese . English jokes about the Dutch in Manhattan were the Polish jokes of colonial times . A Dutch concert was one full of discord , a Dutch barn was one without walls , a Dutch treat was one for which everyone paid , a Dutch feast was one at which the host got drunk before the guests , a Dutch drink was one downed in a gulp , Dutch reckoning was an unitemized bill , a Dutch nightingale was a frog , Dutch courage was bravery induced by alcohol and a Dutch uncle was a man who scolded . In time , to be in Dutch was to be in trouble . How about that , Dutch Reagan ? Oddly enough , by 1775 New Englanders had proudly appropriated the name Yankees for themselves . The only Yankees left in New York now play in the American League . // Washington Irving , who was of Scottish and English descent , picked up on this satirical theme in his books A History of New York from the Beginning of the World to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one Diedrich Knickerbocker , and The Sketch Book . // Thanks to Irving 's History , the term Knickerbocker came into use . A venerable figure named Father Knickerbocker was drawn to personify New York City , and loose breeches became known as knickerbockers , or knickers , because George Cruikshank 's illustrations in the History showed Dutchmen wearing them . New Yorkers who were proud of their Dutch background became members of a Knickerbocker aristocracy , and according to Baseball , the Early Years by Harold Seymour , the first organized baseball team about which much is known was the Knickerbocker Base Ball Club of New York , which was formed in 1845 . It was literally a club , not a team . Limited to 40 members , the Knickerbockers blackballed applicants who lacked standing in the community . Members took a ferry across the Hudson to play at the Elysian Fields in Hoboken , described in Seymour 's book as " one of the most picturesque and delightful places imaginable . " There the club president picked two captains , who chose sides among the members . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the modern game , and some remain , such as nine men to a side and three outs to an inning . Not until 1846 did the Knickerbockers play against other teams , but they were composed of upper-class gentlemen . One team was even named the Social Base Ball Club . // If these clubs had had their way , baseball would have stayed in the grip of high society . But they did n't , and the argument can be made that the harbor was responsible for opening up baseball to the masses . The first men to break through what Seymour calls the Knickerbockers ' " horsehide curtain " were a group of Brooklyn shipyard workers and mechanics who in 1855 formed the Eckford Club , named for Henry Eckford , a shipbuilder who had supervised construction at the Brooklyn Navy Yard in 1817 . Soon other working men formed teams , and the popularity of baseball took off . In time the Eckford Club members started calling themselves the Brooklyn Eckfords , and in 1871 , the very first season of professional baseball , they replaced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , New York Mutuals , Washington Olympics , Chicago White Stockings , Boston Red Stockings and four other clubs in the National Association . Major league baseball abandoned Brooklyn for Los Angeles in 1957 , but New York still has Knickerbockers , who play basketball in the NBA. // Many Dutch place names are still to be found in the harbor and the New York area . The Kill van Kull and Arthur Kill , the waterways separating Staten Island and New Jersey , come from the Dutch kil for a channel . Gat , a pass in a channel , survives in Hell Gate , a stretch in the East River , all of which the Dutch originally named Hellegat . Coney Island comes from konijn , Dutch for rabbit , and Sandy Hook from hoek , a bend or corner . Harlem was named after Haarlem , a city in Holland . Originally a marshy meadow , Harlem later became noted for the vegetables with which it supplied the city . // Dutch words also passed into the vocabulary of English-speaking New Yorkers . These include boss , bush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Dodgers played ) , dope ( for a fool ) , cookie , stoop ( a platform with steps at the door of a house ) , waffle , hunky-dory ( from the Dutch honk , a goal in a game ) and sloop . Sloops were the major means of transportation in the colony . Patterned after broad-bottomed canal vessels in Holland , a sloop had a single mast placed well forward , a large mainsail to catch even the feeblest puff of air , a small jib and sometimes a topsail . For more than 300 years , sloops carried passengers and cargo between New York and Albany . In the mid-1780s , the sloop Experiment made the first direct voyage from the U.S. to China . Alexander Hamilton wrote a paper , the first to be printed by The Federalist , while aboard a sloop becalmed in the Hudson . In 1969 folk singer Pete Seeger and other enthusiasts launched a 106-foot sloop , Clearwater , to call attention to the deterioration of the harbor and the Hudson . // Under British rule the harbor prospered , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and New Yorkers bought a gun-ship to go after them . Its commander was a resident of Liberty Street , William Kidd . After Captain Kidd left the harbor on one of his patrols , he turned pirate himself and roamed the seas in search of booty . Kidd was eventually caught at sea and hanged in London , but not before he buried some of his treasure on Gardiner 's Island off Long Island . Kidd 's Point in the Hudson , 40 miles north of Manhattan , is so named because other treasure supposedly went down there when Kidd 's ship was scuttled during a storm . // During the American Revolution , the British took New York City following victories in the battles of Long Island and Harlem Heights . An American Army captain from Connecticut , Nathan Hale , volunteered to spy on the British on Long Island . He followed the enemy to Manhattan where he was captured and hanged from an apple tree in an orchard , thought to be near what today is the intersection of East Broadway and Market Street . The British @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then chop up the colonies one by one . But General Johnny Burgoyne , who marched south from Canada , was defeated in the Battle of Saratoga , and Benedict Arnold 's traitorous attempt to deliver the fortifications at West Point to the British failed . During the war 11,000 American prisoners died from disease , flogging and starvation while held aboard the Jersey and other hulks moored in Wallabout Bay in the East River , the most disgraceful British action of the war . // New York City and the harbor really took off after the War of 1812 . By 1820 the city , then confined to Manhattan Island ( the boroughs of Brooklyn , Queens , Staten Island and the Bronx did n't join until 1898 ) , had a population of 150,000 and was the largest in the country .

The inrush of immigrants that began in the 1840s hastened the growth of suburban communities , as city dwellers fled old neighborhoods . In 1826 William Fuller , an English boxer , came to New York as part of the company in Pierce Egan 's play Tom and Jerry and stayed on to give " Lessons in the ... manly Science , whereby gentlemen , after a few lessons , are enabled to chastise those who may offer violence , and protect themselves against the attack of the ruffian . " But boxing did not receive the upper-class imprimatur it enjoyed in England from swells like Lord Byron . The sport here fell under the domination of the Know-Nothing party , precursor of the Ku Klux Klan , which sought to restrict immigration , and Irish toughs who used the ring as a bloody battleground to settle disputes in their " wars of the houses . " One of the Irishmen , John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on to serve in Congress . // Many of the Irish worked on the docks as longshoremen or opened waterfront saloons . In this century , two longshoremen of Irish descent , Gene Tunney and James J. Braddock , won the heavyweight championship of the world , and Frank McGuire left the docks to become a college basketball player and then a successful coach . Dusty Rhodes , an Alabama boy who starred for the Giants in their 1954 World Series victory , worked on a harbor tug after his playing days , and Sandy Saddler , the featherweight champion in the late ' 40s and mid- ' 50s now teaches physical education at the National Maritime Union . // An ex-sailor named Eugene O'Neill hung out in Luke O'Connor 's West Side saloon . O'Neill also frequented another bar known as Jimmy the Priest 's , which he renamed Johnny the Priest 's in Anna Christie and also used as a model for the bar in The Iceman Cometh .

" // If the harbor had a sporting golden age , it was the 1840s , when the great clipper ships were being built in the East River yards and when piers on the Hudson side of Manhattan were first being used to berth big transatlantic steamers . In 1844 , a year before the Knickerbockers baseball club was formed , the New York Yacht Club was founded by John Cox Stevens , who had built the baseball diamond at the Elysian Fields . Sailing was a passion for a certain class of New Yorker , and when in 1850 the club learned that the British wanted to include an example of New York 's excellent pilot schooners in The Great Exhibition of 1851 , the members commissioned George Steers , a young ship designer , to build them a boat . // Steers came out of a very competitive school . For many years the rival pilots from the New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out to sea to vie for ships to guide into the harbor , competing like cabdrivers for a passenger . In 1841 Steers designed the William G. Hagstaff for the Jersey pilots , and she regularly beat the New York boats . Then Steers was commissioned to build a faster boat for Captain Dick Brown , the best of the New York pilots , and he designed the Mary Taylor , named after a popular entertainer of the day , which beat every boat in the harbor . The New York Yacht Club hired Steers to build a larger version of the Mary Taylor to send to England . America , sailed by Brown , went on to win The Race of All Nations off the Isle of Wight and took home with her what became known as the America 's Cup . Interestingly , the British raised a fuss about America 's keel , just as the Americans did about Australia II 's when the Aussies broke the 132-year string of U.S. victories and won the America 's Cup in 1983. // Between 1870 and 1920 , most of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off New York Harbor . In 1899 a 25-year-old Italian , Guglielmo Marconi , became the first sportscaster , reporting the progress of the races to two New York newspapers over the wireless transmitter he invented . In 1930 the New York Yacht Club moved the races to Newport , R.I. , on the grounds that the harbor was getting too oily and too crowded . // In the mid to late 19th century , angling in the harbor and adjacent waters was the sport of many New Yorkers . In 1845 John J. Brown , a New York tackle dealer , published The American Angler 's Guide , the first book of its kind in the country . In it he reprinted a New-York Herald story reporting that in 1844 a New Yorker had caught the biggest fish ever taken on a rod and reel , a 70-pound drum landed in the Harlem River . Robert Barnwell Roosevelt , an uncle of Theodore Roosevelt , also fished around New York . He wrote three books about fishing and served as the State Commissioner of Fisheries . // Grumbling about pollution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ following the advent of the petroleum industry . People began to complain of an oily taste in fish and oysters . Raw sewage also took a toll . In 1916 , after a number of people contracted typhoid fever from eating oysters , all the beds in the harbor were closed , and they remain closed today . This was a shock to New Yorkers ; the oysters were ranked among the best in the world . During the Civil War , Napoleon III , the emperor of France , had sent a naval officer , a Lieutenant de Broca , to the U.S. to see whether any species of American shellfish were worth transplanting to French waters . // De Broca did not disappoint his emperor . He wrote , " It would be impossible to find anything more acceptable to the palate than certain preparations of oysters furnished by the good restaurants of New York , such as Delmonico 's . " De Broca shipped 600 oysters and 5,000 hard-shell clams from the harbor to France for planting . // Today there is no question that the harbor has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there wo n't be any need to stock it with fish . They 're already there . The harbor is an estuary , where salt water from the sea meets fresh water from the land . By nature , estuaries are extraordinarily productive because tidal action causes them to retain their nutrients , and the New York Harbor-Hudson River system is one of the most productive of all . In the early 1970s , scientists at the Boyce Thompson Institute , now affiliated with Cornell University , reported that the populations of marine worms , soft-shell clams and other bottom-dwelling organisms in the harbor and the lower Hudson " equaled or exceeded those populations found in other estuaries throughout the world . " From the water column itself , BTI scientists collected an abundance of copepods , microscopic crustaceans that are important food for both juvenile and filter-feeding fish . Dr. Edward H. Buckley , who initiated the BTI study , says , " The situation was 180 degrees different from what we expected to find  --  a dead or nearly dead harbor . One of the beautiful things about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entrance of the estuary , and the heavy tidal flow in the harbor basically acts as an aeration and distribution system for the extreme abundance of nutrients , both up and down the harbor and the lower Hudson . If the city had been built 45 or 50 miles up the Hudson we would have a different story because the river would not have been able to handle nutrient loading of this magnitude . " // Moreover , because of its location , and the seasonal changes and varied terrain that offer different habitats , the New York area is a meeting place for both northern and southern forms offish and wildlife , some of which spawn or breed at this extremity of their ranges . Seawater temperatures in the New York Bight off the harbor vary by almost 48 in the course of a year . In winter months , codfish , ling and whiting , which like cold , if not subarctic , water , enter the harbor , while tomcod spawn in the Hudson , the southern limit of their range , which extends north to Labrador . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harbor . Seth Rosenbaum , an angler from Whitestone , N.Y. , with an eye for rare species , has caught bonito on rod and reel in the East River and netted triggerfish , snowy grouper , orangespotted filefish and lookdowns  --  tropical species all  --  in the waters of the harbor . Sixty-eight miles up the Hudson , Tom Lake of Wappingers Falls has caught ladyfish , common in South Florida and the Caribbean . The most unusual tropical species netted in the Hudson , 35 miles north of Manhattan , was a juvenile mangrove snapper , now in the collection of the American Museum of Natural History . The mangrove snapper , usually found in this hemisphere from the Florida Keys south to Brazil , is the only fish species ever taken from both the Hudson and Congo rivers . // At least 190 species of birds have bred in the Greater New York area , and more than 400 species have been sighted and identified .

The Jamaica Bay Wildlife Refuge , part of the Gateway National Recreation Area and hard by Kennedy Airport , has hosted 100,000 shorebirds in a single day . This refuge is the creation of the late Herbert Johnson , a New York City parks department employee who had studied the suitability of different grasses for golf courses before he was put in charge of Jamaica Bay in 1953 . There , Johnson supervised the construction of two freshwater ponds , and he created rich topsoil by mixing sewage sludge with sand already on hand . Then he grew plants that would yield bumper crops of seeds and berries , and he even planted grains . // Johnson 's imaginative creation of habitat stands out in a region where loss of habitat has been the custom .

The first large-scale project to be entirely approved by the State Department of Environmental Protection , Port Libert , which will cost about $700 million to build , has begun . The president , CEO and managing partner of Port Libert is Paul Bucha , 42 , a West Point and Stanford business school graduate who received the congressional Medal of Honor for valor in Vietnam , taught economics at West Point and then resigned from the Army to enter business .

" // And never so many and never so dramatically and never so hopefully as next week , when the centerpiece of it all  --  the majestic old lady of the harbor  --  gets her full due and deserved attention on the occasion of the 100th year she has stood guard over the tumultuous and unpredictable waters of what can only be called America 's Harbor .
