In Central Asia , the worries about Afghanistan are real <P> The debate still goes on in the U.S. over why the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan last December . Hawkish observers-including National Security Adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski-have argued that the move could turn out to be Moscow 's first big step toward the oil and warm waters of the Persian Gulf . Historian George Kennan and other defenders of dtente say no , the Kremlin was acting defensively to shore up its southern border . Not surprisingly , the latter interpretation is endorsed in the Soviet Union . Also not surprisingly , an insistence on the defensive , legitimate and temporary nature of the Afghan operation echoed throughout interviews conducted by TIME Diplomatic Correspondent Strobe Talbott during a tour of Transcaucasia and Central Asia . <P> The invasion was the most sensitive subject bound to come up in interviews with an American journalist , and the officials had carefully rehearsed their opening thoughts . Baltabai Yusupov , an Uzbek newspaper editor in Tashkent , even introduced what he called " strictly my own personal opinion " by noting for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entirely with the position expressed by Comrade Leonid Ilyich Brezhnev in Pravda . " Last month the Soviet President justified the invasion as a defense of Afghanistan against intervention by the forces of " imperialism . " <P> In many of the interviews there was a revealing shift in emphasis as the discussions continued . At first those interviewed stressed the " fraternal " nature of the invasion-a generous Soviet response to a cry for help from a beleaguered neighbor . Gradually the stress shifted to Soviet self-interest-the desire to cauterize a festering , perhaps malignant sore on the soft underbelly of the U.S.S.R. <P> Sakin Begmatova , Foreign Minister of the Kirghiz Soviet Socialist Republic , * began by stating , " We wanted to make sure that no one strangles the Afghans ' people 's revolution . " As the conversation went on , she recalled an incident-before the April 1978 revolution that brought the Marxists to power in Kabul-when the Soviets helped the Afghans fight a plague of locusts near the border . " That could have spread to us , " noted Begmatova , " the locusts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Might one reason why the Soviet Union moved into Afghanistan be to prevent the spread of a political locust plague into the U.S.S.R. ? Begmatova denied heatedly that she had intended any such analogy : It is the official Soviet position that the Central Asian republics are utterly loyal to Moscow and that their Muslim populations are immune to contamination from the south , where Islamic fundamentalism and militancy are rampant . <P> Over and over again , especially toward the end of any discussion of Afghanistan , the issue of proximity kept coming up . Warned Begmatova : " I say to you as a human being , as a woman , as a mother and as a grandmother , that country Afghanistan is right on our border . " Gairat Sapargaliyev , a law professor in Alma-Ata , said : " Afghanistan is , after all , a country on our own border ! " Sapar Baizhanov , the editor in chief of Socialist Kazakhstan , put it this way : " We 're not talking about Canada , after all , we 're talking about a country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
