Mr. Gardner , who left Rome today and is to resume teaching international law at Columbia University next fall , feels that he is leaving Italian-American relations in a much healthier state than when he arrived . Most Italian politicians and journalists would agree with him. // When Mr. Gardner was sent here by the Carter Administration , the Communists were basking in 1976 election gains that gave them more than a third of the popular vote for the first time , and they were pushing hard to become members of the government . Today they are in the opposition , isolated and on the defensive after several election setbacks. // The Socialist Party is steadily becoming more anti-Communist . It has joined other non-Communist parties in a Government for the first time in 14 years and is gradually transforming itself into a social democratic party along the lines of Chancellor Helmut Schmidt ' s group in West Germany . <> <> No Longer Interfering Directly // American policies and affairs are being discussed with respect by Italian newspapers , and there is little predictable antiAmericanism . Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though still trying to influence Italian politics , is no longer interfering directly . " They no longer go around stuffing dollar bills into the pockets of generals and politicians , " a Communist politician said. // It is not that Mr. Gardner has brought all this about . But , as Egidio Ortona , a former Ambassador to Washington and delegate at the United Nations put it , " he has been a good influence ; a poor ambassador could have done a lot of damage. " // Mr. Gardner has been a tireless worker , traveler and speaker , making about 40 major speeches a year in all parts of the country and driving his large embassy staff mercilessly. // He and his Italian-born wife , Danielle , have been hosts to a steady stream of politicians , businessmen , professors , writers and artists . Unlike previous ambassadors who limited their hospitality largely to the hard core of establishment politicians and businessmen , the Gardners have been reaching out into less conventional sectors of Italian society . <> <> Cultivating Socialist Leader // Mr. Gardner has been cultivating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who has been moving to the right and hopes to become Italy ' s first non-Christian Democratic prime minister. // The Ambassador has also been in contact with the younger antiCommunist Christian Democrats in Parliament who hope to replace their party ' s aging leadership . The embassy believes that they can be relied upon to bury the " historic compromise , " the concept that Italy can be governed only by cooperation between its two largest parties , the Christian Democrats and the Communists. // In terms of United States foreign policy , Mr. Gardner ' s finest hour came in December 1979 , when Italy became the first European country to accept the deployment of new American cruise and Pershing II missiles . The Italian decision was crucial . The West Germans had said they would accept the missiles only if another European nation did . The Dutch , Belgian and Danish Governments could not do so for domestic political reasons . The Italian Government , even though the country has Western Europe ' s largest Communist Party , not only accepted the missiles but did it without serious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Italian decision possible was that Mr. Craxi , whose party had once rejected NATO entirely , was willing to support it . <> <> Supported Sanctions Against Iran // Italy also went along with the American call for sanctions against Iran even though it had about $3 billion in contracts in Iran along with 1 , 800 Italian technicians as potential hostages . The Italian Government also supported the boycott of the Moscow Olympics last year , but the Olympic committee sent its members to Moscow anyway. // When he arrived here in 1977 , Mr. Gardner had a dual assignment concerning the Communists . On one hand , he had to carry on with the traditional American policy of helping to keep the Communists out of the government of a major ally . On the other hand , since the Communists were a major power in the country , Washington wanted him to acknowledge their power and to establish contacts for the first time between the embassy and Communist officials to find out what their thinking and intentions were. // It was a difficult policy to carry out . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him as an " openminded man " representing a more open-minded Administration. // Soon afterward , when a State Department spokesman , with the French election campaign in mind , declared that Washington did not want to see the Communists " dominant " in an allied government , the Italian left concluded that since the Communists here could not possibly be dominant , the United States had lifted its unqualified opposition to their entry into the government . <> <> Correcting a Misconception // President Jimmy Carter later corrected the statement from " dominant " to " influential , " but the misconception was kept alive inadvertently by some and purposely by others . The Rome daily La Repubblica , which supported the Communist effort to enter the government , praised Mr. Gardner and the Carter Administration so consistently that the Ambassador finally sent a man around to see the editors and tell them , in effect , that look , we are not nearly as open-minded as you seem to think. // In a recent conversation , Mr. Gardner said he was appalled when he arrived here to see how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Culture is politics here , " he said . " The Communists are systematically trying to establish a cultural hegemony in the schools , the press , the unions , the judiciary and only last in the government. " // The Ambassador upgraded American cultural programs , including the translation of American books , language programs and scholarships paid by private Italian and American businesses . He hopes that these programs will continue. // " Erosion of the intellectual and cultural foundation of the alliance could be just as great a threat as the Soviet SS-20 , " he said , referring to the Soviet medium-range missile . " It would be tragic if these programs fell. " //
