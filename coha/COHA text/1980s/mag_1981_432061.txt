 | The fires of inflation that have seared the nation for more than a decade are cooling , but at a price ? a recession and rising unemployment . Encouraging signs keep popping up amid still serious rises in living costs . Home prices so far this year have climbed at only one third of last year 's pace . Food prices are n't galloping ahead as fast as they were . Unions appear to be lowering wage demands . The consumer price index soared to a 14.8 percent annual rate in September , mainly because of rising mortgage rates and a jump in college-tuition costs . But as the effect of both factors eases , government experts look for a substantial moderation in the index between now and the end of the year . The cost of living is up 10.1 percent through the first nine months of this year . To support their optimism , experts note that prices charged by producers rose last month by the smallest amount in more than three years . This should be reflected in future consumer prices . President Reagan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his goals for lowering the cost of living : Holding the increase in consumer @# prices to 9.9 percent this year , much less than last year 's 13.5 percent jump ; Slowing inflation in 1982 to only a 7 percent rise , which would be thelowest annual increase since 1977 ; Easing inflation further in 1983 and beyond to annual rates below 6 percent Such goals , if Reagan reaches them , will be a major improvement over what Americans have been coping with . At 13.5 percent last year , the rise in the cost of living was the sharpest since the 14.4 percent increase in 1947 after World War II controls were removed Even if inflation is lowered to the 10 percent range this year , the average for 1980-81 will be just under 12 percent . That compares with a 7.8 percent average annual increase in the consumer price index during the decade of the 1970s and 2.7 percent in the 1960s . In sum , the climb in the cost of living in recent years has been the steepest since the World War I period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Fed . Why the current progress ? Experts from universities , Wall Street and the world of econonic forecasting give primary credit to the Federal Reserve Board 's tight-money policy , rather than to Reagan . " Monetary policy is the only anti-inflation game in town , " says Arnold Moskowitz , first vice president for Dean Witter Reynolds , Inc. , a New York-based securities firm . Is the tight-money cure for inflation working ? " A resounding yes , " answers Moskowitz , an opinion shared by most of the economists interviewed . So far , the Fed 's policies have worked by raising interest rates , making it very costly for consumers and businessmen to borrow to buy . This has deadened retail purchases of autos , housing and other big-ticket items and has made it expensive for businesses to carry large inventories . Consequently , price increases have slowed . A survey of top-level business executives by the Conference Board  | page deleted  | ing to pay the price ? particularly joblessness for millions . Experts point out that the success against inflation has been achieved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relief from high unemployment in sight . In their view , the economy is in recession now , with recovery at least six months away . This means , they say , that neither the snappy economic growth with low inflation nor the gradual decline in joblessness forecast by Reagan for next year is likely . " One thing you can fault the President on is that he suggested that the transition to a noninflationary economy would be painless , " declares Rudolph Penner , an economist for the Washington-based American Enterprise Institute . " It wo n't be . " Instead of the 3.4 percent rise in total output after subtracting inflation , predicted by the President for 1982 , many experts look for a 2 percent growth rate at best . Instead of the small drop in unemployment forecast by Reagan , from 7.5 percent this year to 7.3 percent next year , they expect joblessness to be close to 8 percent at the end of 1982 . As Penner notes , those countries that have whipped inflation have not been able to do so without considerable pain . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loss in real output in 1975-76 to wipe out the inflation triggered by the sharp rise in oil prices in 1973-74 . All this spells potential trouble . Since the Reagan budget threatens a series of big deficits , the burden of driving down the cost of living will continue to fall on the Federal Reserve . Hard choice . As recession bites in , Congress is unlikely to reduce the deficit . But if the federal deficit is n't shrunk , say the experts , the Fed will be compelled to pursue the tight-money policies that have pushed interest rates to record highs . So by next spring , in an election year , the central bank could face a difficult choice If it eases up to lift the economy out of recession , the fires of inflation could reignite and this year 's gain will prove to be transitory . If it sticks with the anti-inflation campaign , the hoped-for recovery could be stunted or aborted , and unemployment could climb even higher than 8 percent . What all this adds up to , say many experts , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bring inflation down . If Americans decide not to pay that price , the cure under way now may not last . Inflation Hits Us All ? Some More Than Others Inflation is an unofficial tax that eats away at the value of everyone 's money . But not everyone pays the tax equally . Over the past 20 years , many federal social programs and union wage contracts have insulated their recipients from the ravages of inflation . Indexing and cost-of-living clauses lift benefits and wages automatically with the rising consumer-price level . For that reason , according to an analysis by the Economic Unit of US.News &; World Report , the elderly , the poor and union workers have not paid the tax of inflation to the same degree that other Americans have . Who , then , is hit the hardest ? It 's mainly the middle class , including those in the professions . A Labor Department study shows how average middle-class professionals lost ground from June , 1971 , to March , 1981 , when inflation more than doubled . Examples : The salary of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1971 to $54,792 in 1981 . But , after inflation was subtracted , the lawyer suffered an earnings loss of 4.4 percent . A journeyman engineer who got $15,535 in 1971 was earning $31,352 in 1981 , but the engineer 's earning power declined by 7.5 percent . A midlevel accountant , paid $11,383 in 1971 , lost 5.2 percent in earning power in 10 years . Only if the professional owned a home that appreciated in value over the period did he or she have a chance of breaking even , finds a separate study by Joseph Minarik , a scholar formerly at the Brookings Institution in Washington . His Brookings study suggests that " better off " persons , those earning $47,500 and above today , suffer heavily from the rising cost of living Not only are they pushed into high er tax brackets , but inflation erode the value of their savings and investments . However , many of the wellto-do can offset some of the impact by investing at interest rates that have been outrunning inflation . The Economic Unit analysis shows the groups hit the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poor and the elderly . COLA clauses . About 5.1 million . or 56 percent , of unionized workers under major contracts are covered by **25;293;TOOLONG ( COLA clauses . They receive automatic pay hikes , above negotiated raises , to offset inflation in whole or in part . But COLA 's did more . A typical union member 's wages and benefits . excluding COLA , rose by 136.4 percent from 1970 to mid-1981 , as inflation was rising by 133 percent . Many of the poor , although facing joblessness and other woes , are not much worse off because of inflation . They rely heavily for income on federal social programs . many of them indexed to keep pace with inflation . The Brookings study concludes that those who earned less than $20,000 in 1970 lost no buying power in the ensuing decade . Washington does not count noncash government benefits , such as food stamps , in determining who falls below the official poverty level . If these were included , many of the poor would not be officially poor . New government benefits , many that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ senior citizens to keep even with inflation . Although some retirees who depend on private pensions have had trouble because their benefits frequently are not boosted in line with prices , Social Security pensions are adjusted upward automatically . In 1959 , 35.2 percent of the elderly lived in official poverty . In 20 years . this was down to 15.1 percent . Again . this calculation does not include noncash federal aid , such as food stamps . all of which in 1980 averaged $1,566 per person age 65 and older . Thus , while inflation eats away at everyone 's income , it takes a bigger bite from some than others .
