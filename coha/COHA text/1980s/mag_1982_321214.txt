I know how easy it is to overlook the persecution of others when your own rights and freedoms are not in jeopardy . I grew up in south Georgia within a legally segregated society , and to the extent that I or my elders felt any responsibility at all for the status of my black playmates , the " separate but equal " ruling of the U.S. Supreme Court seemed sufficient . As a child , I rode a bus to school each day with the other white students , while the black children walked , and never gave a thought to the lack of equality inherent in the separateness . Neither did the adults who managed the education system , nor the lawyers and judges in our courts , nor the Governor , nor those who led our Government in Washington and were responsible for the administration of justice in our great and free nation . It seems almost unbelievable , but only after I had served in the Navy for eleven years , returned home to live , enrolled my oldest son in the same school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sumter County board of education did I finally come to acknowledge that black schoolchildren were still walking to their separate school . <P> It took years of bitter and divisive struggles to change this kind of broad discrimination . During the heat of those legal contests , when some blood was spilled , it was shocking to observe the degree of racial prejudice among people I admired and knew to be otherwise fair-and kind and compassionate . Some of them became expert at finding Bible scriptures to prove that God wanted them to be fair , kind , compassionate-and racist . <P> It was deeply moving to see the end of legal segregation in the South and to observe the immediate benefits that came to all of us . To me , the political and social transformation of the Southland was a powerful demonstration of how moral principles should and could be applied effectively to the legal structure of our society . <P> I had pointed out in my speech accepting the Democratic nomination for President in July 1976 : " Ours was the first nation to dedicate itself clearly to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ captured the imagination of mankind . " It was time for us to capture the imagination of the world again . I was familiar with the arguments that we had to choose between idealism and realism , between morality and the exertion of power ; but I rejected those claims . To me , the demonstration of American idealism was a practical and realistic approach to foreign affairs , and moral principles were the best foundation for the exertion of American power and influence . <P> I was determined to combine support for our more authoritarian allies and friends with the effective promotion of human rights within their countries . By inducing them to change their repressive policies , we would be enhancing freedom and democracy and helping to remove the reasons for revolutions that often erupt among those who suffer from persecution . We might therefore accomplish our purposes without replacing a rightist totalitarian regime with a leftist one of the same oppressive character . A human rights effort would also help strengthen our influence among developing nations that were still in the process of choosing their future friends and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do .
