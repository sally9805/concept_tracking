What specific changes do you have in mind ? <P> A. In a dynamic society like Mexico the people always want changes , but not in the fundamental principles of our system . I have summarized those principles in seven fundamental themes .

The Mexican people want changes within a process of deliberate planning . They want a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : development , employment and combating inflation . What concerns the people of Mexico most right now is our financial and economic crisis . <P> <P> Q. What will you do to take Mexico out of this crisis ? <P> A. The financial and economic crisis that Mexico is living through is truly grave . This comes about because we have structural imbalances in our economy that we must correct .

What are you going to do about the nationalized banks ? <P> A. We are going to keep the banks nationalized ( this decision is irreversible ) and we will make use of this new instrument with seriousness , professionalism , efficiency and honesty . <P> Q. How do you see the Mexican-U.S. relationship changing as a result of Mexico 's economic problems ? <P> A. I have seen good will manifested on the part of the American Government to help Mexico in moments of crisis . That would seem to me to be a very intelligent attitude on the part of the U.S. The relationship between Mexico and the U.S. , although it has its difficult aspects , will continue fundamentally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends , and I am sure the relationship will have a positive and fruitful tone during my administration . <P> Q.
