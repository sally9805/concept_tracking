The decision was made by one man , against the recommendation of nearly every other senior Administration adviser . But he happened to be the U.S. Secretary of State and the most powerfully determined opponent to a U.S. appearance by P.L.O . Chairman Yasser Arafat . George Shultz proudly takes  --  and certainly deserves  --  full credit for the Great Visa Flap . <P> The bulldog Secretary acted " from his gut , " say State Department aides , but not completely without outside support . A majority of 51 Senators urged him not to admit Arafat . Some members of Congress had been quietly in touch with Jewish representatives . " We did n't want the campaign against Arafat to be an Israeli one ; we wanted America to take the lead , " explained an Israeli official . But Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir went on record as opposing a visa for Arafat in a mid-November meeting with U.S. Ambassador Tom Pickering . <P> On Nov. 25 , when Arafat formally asked for entry , Shultz consulted his top advisers . A broad array of officials counseled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Secretary for Near Eastern and South Asian Affairs ; Michael Armacost , Under Secretary for Political Affairs ; National Security Adviser Colin Powell ; Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci . The U.S. delegation to the U.N . strongly endorsed Arafat 's admission . The arguments ranged from policy to practicality . A denial would undermine U.S. Middle East policy and would offend nearly the entire U.N . <P> Only two aides shared Shultz 's views : L. Paul Bremer , head of State 's counterterrorism office , who documented the case against Arafat as terrorist ; and Charles Hill , the Secretary 's tight-lipped , omnipresent personal assistant , who is known to share Shultz 's strongly pro-Israel views . <P> The consultations were in effect pro forma . Shultz delivered his decision to deny the visa early Saturday morning . A public statement was drafted and a copy sent to Reagan , vacationing at his Santa Barbara , Calif. , ranch . Powell called the President to summarize the pros and cons . Said a laconic senior official : " The President understood why the Secretary came to that conclusion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incoming Secretary of State James Baker , who will inherit the repercussions , was consulted . Bush advisers were happy to distance the President-elect from the brouhaha . Said a grateful aide : " They chose not to discuss this issue with us . " <P> Why had Shultz ignored so much contrary advice ? " This decision , " explained one of his senior aides , " was a reflection of Shultz 's deep psyche . " Associates point to his long-avowed vendetta against terrorism . A friend , Robert Ames , was among the dead in the truck bombing of the U.S. embassy in Beirut . Schultz was singled out by anonymous terrorists as the target of a car bomb placed near a Jerusalem hotel where he was staying in March . <P> Shultz had also been frustrated in every attempt to move the many parties in the Middle East toward peace  --  and he seemed to blame Arab leaders far more than Israeli intransigence for his failures . His personal distrust of the Arabs stems from their regular rejection of his initiatives , such as the 1983 Lebanon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same time , his support for Israel , despite provocations like the Pollard spy affair , has been unflagging.
