I hope you have already read the letter from managing editor Henry Muller on the opening page of this issue . In it , he discusses the ideas behind the innovations you will notice as you read the magazine . Let me go one step further and describe some of the specific stories that illustrate these changes . <P> American Ideas introduces you to Sister Pearl Ceasar , a Roman Catholic nun in El Paso 's Rio Grande Valley . Using the precepts developed by the late Saul Alinsky , a Chicago social activist , she is leading a campaign to bring drinking water to impoverished families along the Mexican border . <P> Our Interview is with Allan Bloom , the University of Chicago political philosopher whose best-selling book The Closing of the American Mind has prompted a sobering reappraisal of U.S. higher education . The exchange , which lasted four hours , was conducted by senior correspondent William McWhirter . <P> In the Travel section , contributor Pico Iyer takes you to Thailand , the " Land of Smiles " as well as this year 's hottest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Asian jewel , from the cool allure of the hill town of Chiangmai to the seaside resort of Pattaya to the thriving capital of Bangkok . <P> To help you find these and other stories , the index has been expanded to two pages . If an index can be likened to a restaurant menu , the People section can be compared to dessert . Starting this week , dessert is regularly two pages instead of one . <P> This issue also marks the introduction of a subtle but distinct change in look , including a bolder use of photography and more graphics . These and other design alterations are the work of Rudolph Hoglund , TIME 's art director for eight years , who was assisted by designers Angel Ackemyer and Colleen McCudden . The team set out not to remake the magazine but to fine-tune it visually . " One of the oldest rules in design is that form follows function , " says Hoglund . " All our changes are intended to function as tools to provide more information and organize it in a way that makes it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to you .
