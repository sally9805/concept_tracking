txt BASEBALL  --  WHO NEEDS IT ? Who , really . except athletes who ca n't use bubble gum cards to keep up payments on an . s and villas ? Who really cares if there is a strike , and a prolonged period when we must live with some surrogate national pastime ? Certainly not the majority of fed-up fans . But a Chicagoan , prominent in quaint financial ci  --  cles , says : " Baseball  --  who needs it ? I need baseball . I have friends and associates , all over the country , in the same boat . " With a baseball strike appearing probable , however , this picturesque financier , his business associates and friends are concerned , anxious , suffering cold sweats , and wondering how long they 'll be on welfare . In chorus , they lament : " Our economy is in bad shape , already . A baseball strike could n't come at a worse time . " THE IDENTITY or THE Chicago husinessman.financier will remain anonymous . That 's because he does n't need publicity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking batting practice on my kneecaps , shoulders , and noggin . ? He is a bookmaker . He earns his bread , and the high-priced spread , by taking bets . At this hour , he and similar entrepreneurs need baseball like crazy . He illustrates . " Look , the pro basketball season is finished . Pro football does n't start for 1 do n't know how many weeks . What do we do for action ? " If there are no baseball games , you think we can survive taking bets on the Olympic Games , that new softball league , and pitty-pat tennis ? " MY HEART BLEEDS . It bleeds for the owners , players , vendors , chumps who bought season tickets , and , most of all , for bookmakers who might postpone a few meals before fall arrives and they can peddle football parlay cards at candy stores across from grammar schools . But I move the question on the floor : Baseball  --  who needs it ? We need n't take a vote because the answer will come if there is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost guarantee that those owners and players who. so stubbornly butt heads , with no regard for the fan , will not like the answer . A lengthy baseball strike might cause repercussions , and diversions , from which the game would never totally recover . And the feuding parties hod better be aware of that , because nowhere in the Constitution  --  as I have read it  --  is a guarantee that baseball must be the national pastime . There are no , . lieenses Issued that permit owners and players to take ' fans for granted . There is no law ordaining that once you 're a baseball fan , you 're always a baseball tan . TIMES CHANGE , NO GOOD thing lasts forever . In Amer ' . ca , we accepted the automobile as a way of life , and then came the energy crunch . Suddenly there are people who find they prefer hiking , jogging , cycling , to cruising aimlessly in an automobile , Once we looked at those lavish Loop and neighborhood movie houses as recreational temples that would be filled forever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The drive-ins , good and convenient in their time , in turn lost business when the motel boom started . There have been unanticipated changes in sports , too , Boxing , long the kingpin of spectator events , fell on its nose and survives only because of occasional transfusions by a Muhammad All or a Sugar Ray Leonard . College basketball filled the big arenas until fans were confronted with the point-shaving scandals . Then thousands said : " College basketball  --  who needs it ? " College basketball recovered , after many years , because the NCAA was ingenious enough to devise a thrilling national championship playoff system . The collegians were lucky . THROUGHBRED HORSE RACING , in the Chicago area , may not be so fortunate . Time was when we had America 's finest midsummer racing . Then , because of varied events  --  from handbooks closing to the decline of horseflesh at a local parimutuel wheels  --  housewives , tavern owners , newspaper reporters , , and socialites found they very well could get along without the ponies . Horse race fever now is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can now tell you where to get a bet down if you 're not at the track , but almost any of ' em can grade jogging shoes for you . But , you say , baseball is different . It 's America 's summer game . Is that so ? Well , baseball was in trouble after the Black Sox scandal . Some fans swore off forever . Fortunately , enthusiasm was renewed by the emergence of a law-and-order commissioner , Judge Kenesaw Mountain Landis , and a superstar named Babe Ruth . STILL BASEBALL HAS N'T been in perfect health for some while . The St. Louis Browns vanished . The Braves switched from Boston to Milwaukee and , though twice pen . nant winners in Milwaukee , finally moved on to Atlanta . The Dodgers fled Brooklyn . The Athletics drew only 837,150 fans in Oakland the year they won their third consecutive world championship . The All-Star game , once the midsummer classic , now is a bore . Both players and fans lost interest when players , to build up their pension fund , insisted on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So . . . Baseball  --  who needs it ? If owners and players want to find nut , let them enjoy a strike . Anyone for mixed doubles ?
