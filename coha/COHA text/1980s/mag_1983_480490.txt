BEING good in business is the most fascinating kind of art , " Andy Warhol once said . There was a time when such a remark would be regarded as sarcastic . But no more . A new generation of American artists has rejected the modernist notion of art as a " spiritual project " ( in the words of Susan Sontag ) . Abandoning the elitist alienation that was the hallmark of their predecessors , they have thrown themselves wholeheartedly into the art market , a world increasingly embracing salesmanship and public relations . They are now consciously trying to create works that people will both enjoy and buy . And the art world is bristling with an energy that has n't been felt for two decades , since Pop Art and Warhol 's first tomato soup cans . There has been an explosion of new movements under the rubric of " Post-Modernism " : Neo-Expressionism , Post-Pop , New Wave . PowCarey Lovelace lives in New York and writes about the arts . Julian Schnabel , The Raft , 1982 . One of HARPER'S/JULY 1983 erful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new artists during the 1970s , are suddenly exhibiting the work of the younger generation . The number of gallery-goers increases weekly , crowding the streets of Soho , Manhattan 's downtown art mecca . There are out-of-town visitors and European tourists as well as the collectors , whose numbers are now likely to include not only the rich but corporations and young professionals . Their shopping list includes the young German Neo-Expressionists Anselm Kiefer , A. R. Penck , and Sigmar Polke as well as the Italian " Three Cs " : Sandro Chia , Enzo Cucchi , and Francesco Clemente . At the top of the list , however , is an American : Julian Schnabel , the new wunderkind , the first " star " to appear on the scene in more than a decade . His meteoric rise is viewed with a mixture of enthusiasm and suspicion . Says Marcia Tucker , director of the New Museum , " It 's astonishing to me that the public is treating a thirty-one-year-old like he the famous " plate " paintings . was an old master . " Schnabel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and encrusted with antlers , wooden beams , and shattered plates ? are brooding and bold in their imagery . They spearhead the movement known as Neo-Expressionism after the garish works of the German movement of sixty years ago . Hilton Kramer , writing in The New York Times , contrasted Schnabel 's works with " the austere nourishment of Minimal Art " and called them " the pictorial equivalent of a junk food binge . " Sympathetic viewers admire them for their aggressive sculptural edge , though some critics regard them as derivative collages of scraps of art history . More than painterly craft , however , what is universally recognized in Schnabel 's paintings is their energy . For Schnabel has ambition . He was born in Brooklyn , New York , the son of a successful businessman . Raised in Brownsville , Texas , he studied at the University of Houston , then moved to New York in 1973 . Even in Texas , Schnabel was clear about one thing : " I 'm going to be the greatest artist in the world , " he told friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where he worked part time as a chef , he met someone whose ambition matched his own : the cool , tough Mary Boone . A CHIC , petite woman of Egyptian heritage , Boone , now thirty-one , grew up in California . Precocious and bright , she studied at Michigan State University , the Rhode Island School of Design , and Hunter College , then in 1971 , at the age of twenty , landed a job at the Bykert Gallery , a small but respected gallery representing Minimal artists . She assiduously set about learning the trade , and when the gallery closed in 1976 , she had enough contacts among patrons , collectors , and dealers to think about representing artists on her own . Boone visited thousands of artists ' studios , and a year after she visited Schnabel 's she assembled seven backers and opened her own gal-67 lery ? at the prestigious address of 420 West Broadway , the building that houses Leo Castelli , who represents nearly all of the major American artists of the 1960s ( Frank Stella , Robert Rauschenberg , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few ) , as well as other significant dealers . At that time , Boone 's only artists were Schnabel and Gary Stephan , a more established painter . But she set the art world on its ear with a high-pressured sales style radically different from the usual urbane deportment of dealers . While the Old World ? style dealer tries to create an ambience of silent prestige , and lets the forces of the marketplace work on their own to create an artist 's reputation and price range , Boone deliberately fashioned Schnabel 's " image " in the art world . She began by spreading Schnabel 's name around , taking potential clients to his studio , engineering sales to the " right " buyers ( taste-setters such as London advertising executive Charles Saatchi and Ziirich dealer-collector Bruno Bischofberger ) , sending out rumors that his works were scarce . Schnabel had his first show at Boone 's gallery a year after it opened . His paintings were priced at $2,500 . The second was four months later , in San Francisco , with prices slightly higher : $3,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who had himself been impressed by Schnabel 's " plate " paintings in a way he had n't been since first seeing Frank Stella 's austere , black-striped canvases in 1959 . Boone and Castelli arranged a joint show featuring Schnabel 's masterworks of shattered crockery , and they agreed to split the profits . It was the most talked-about event of the season . ( " Julian Schnabel is the overnight success story everybody dreams of , " wrote Artforum . ) Boone ( as usual ) presold the paintings , marking each with a red sticker , and even took the unorthodox step of listing the names of such prestigious buyers as German candy tycoon Peter Ludwig and Greek shipping-empire heir Philip Niarchos . Solo and group shows around the world followed in rapid succession for Schnabel . In 1982 , he had eight solo shows and participated in twenty-two group exhibitions , and was given a solo , three-year retrospective at Amsterdam 's Stedlijk Museum ? a stunning coup for an artist so recent to the scene . In the short time since the first Boone show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as high as $75,000 . And Boone has also become famous in the process . Last spring , a rash of articles suddenly appeared in New York , Forbes , Life , the Saturday Review . ( One of Boone 's major customers is a big name in international advertising , and it was generally assumed he was somehow responsible for the coverage . Booue , however , claims the appearance of so many articles at once was coincidental . ) Boone now represents twelve young , male artists , several already making names for themselves : Matt Mullican , Ross Bleckner . David Salle . " People criticize Mary , " says Patty Brundage , director of caste li 's gallery at 142 Greene Street , " but she was one of the major forces in convincing galleries to start showing younger artists , in making them see that the ' 80s are different . " S CHNABEL 'S hyped success should indicate just how different this decade is from preceding ones . " Until the late 1950s , " Robert Motherwell has said , " success in the art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How could it be ? We were still fighting to win the smallest corner of critical and popular acceptance . " The decade following World War I/ gave birth to Abstract Expressionism , the first major American art movement , which made New York the art capital of the world . But even the leading Abstract Expressionists worked for years in poverty and anonymity . When the seminal painter Jackson Pollock was killed in a car accident in 1956 , for example , the most he 'd ever received for a painting was $8,000 . ( Pollock 's Blue Poles , which was sold by collector Ben Heller in the early 1970s to the Australian government for $2 million , had been bought from another collector in 1956 for $32,000 , and from Pollock in 1953 for $6,000 . ) Overdue recognition was accorded the Abstract Expressionists by the " Sixteen Americans " exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art in 1959 , which included works by a second generation of what was by then known as the New York School : Stella , Rauschenberg , Jasper Johns , and others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peak period , and it felt like it , " says Carolee Schneemann , an artist associated with Fluxus , a loose band of avant-garde artists . " Allan Kaprow , Rauschenberg , all the young artists were staking out territory with an incredible energy . It was more messianic than today , perhaps more naive . " By the end of the 1960s , however , money was beginning to play an ever larger role in the art world . Collectors like Vera List and Eugene Schwartz had carefully cultivated their tastes in contemporary art and bought the works ? and thus assured the personal fortunes ? of Stella , Rauschenberg , Warhol , Kelly . Yet the art world still viewed itself as anticapitalist and antiestablishment : artists were sympathetic to the peace and youth movements of the late Sixties . There were " sit-ins " in front of Picasso 's Guernica at the Museum of Modern Art to protest the death of babies in Vietnam , and " happenings " in which performers HARPER'S/JULY 1983 68 were bound and gagged to dramatize American imperialism . No young artist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emerged during the 1970s . And modernism in art and radicalism in politics , so confidently linked a few years before , began to dissipate . The modernist vision had always been a utopian ideology , a faith in evolution toward an aesthetic or spiritual goal , like the radical belief in secular progress ; both collided with American consumer culture . Around 1970 , many artists left New York and emigrated to the West Coast or Europe . Those who remained launched a rapid succession of movements still intended to evade the " capitalist " status of artas-commodity . Conceptual Art , with its photos , sketches , and diagrams of proposed but unrealized art , was based on the notion that nobody could " own " an idea . Earth Art used bulldozers and heavy equipment to transform tracts of land into works that could n't be " appropriated " by museums . Performance Art involved ephemeral " actions . " Some artists used themselves as raw material for Body Art . Others created subversive , antiestablishment " events " ? Paul Kos , for one , used 7,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Art Center in California . As the 1970s wore on , the basic contradictions underlying all this activity could not be avoided ? all these antiobject , antiaudience , anti-institution works of art were being subsidized by the very corporations , museums , and government bodies they were , in theory , meant to undermine . " The art of the ' 60s and ' 70s came from a time when the economy was fantastic , " says actor-performance artist Eric Bogosian , a member of the current generation . The National Endowment for the Arts , founded in 1965 , had increased its budget during the following fifteen years by 6,000 percent ? from $2.5 million in 1966 to $158.56 million in 1981 . Corporations had discovered that support for the arts was not only noble but good public relations ; their subsidies grew from $22 million in 1967 to $233 million by 1980 . Soon , however , even the most hard-core avant-gardists began to realize that something was amiss ? particularly with the modernist notion of art as a vaulting " spiritual project " that , as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to distinguish sense from nonsense . " By 1975 , ' says Vito Acconci , " exploring a personal , intimate space began to seem escapist . " Bogosian agrees : " Most of it had to do with a vision of the world as a better place , probably 85 percent with altering the way you look at the cosmos . LSD thinking . What 's happening today is more day-to-day stuff . " o WONDER , then , that Warhol is the role model of the moment . The icon of the Pop Art movement of the Sixties , he is the quintes-sential Post-Modernist . His under-ground films , his celebrity lifestyle ( it was a member of Warhol 's co-terie who coined the word " super-star " ) , his anesthetized celebration of the artificial : the new generation 's work resonates with all these , par-ticularly in movements like Post-Pop , with its similar treatment of kitschy artifacts and airhead movie stars . Pose as art . Career as art . Money as art . And Post-Pop shares the earlier movement 's ironical at-titude toward mass culture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oldenburg 's twenty-five-foot vinyl replica of an empty toothpaste tube . Both movements have created art that the public finds familiar and " consumable " ? and artists have found marketable . " As the era of Modernism comes full circle , " writes art critic Suzi Gablik , " our artists are emerging from exile with arms outstretched to greet their old enemy : the market economy . " No doubt the return from exile has been , in part , prompted by economic factors . " Everyone is apprehensive about the future , " says the New Museum 's Tucker . " My colleagues are all talking about real-estate deals and catering services . " To make ends meet , museums like MoMA are selling " air space " for condominiums . Corporate foundations ' subsidies have declined during the recession . And artists , meanwhile , are receiving less support from the NEA , whose funds have been cut back severely . Art school faculty jobs , a traditional fallback , are increasingly hard to come by . At the same time , expenses have increased . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " neighborhoods could be found for a pittance . But the spacious lofts that once could be had in their " raw " industrial state for $200 to $300 a month now rent for as much as $3,000 a month . " And the days are over when you could buy a bit of canvas and a few dollars ' worth of paint , " says Soho art dealer Max Hutchinson . " Take the paintings of Milton Resnick whose canvases feature dense layers of oil paint . There must be $2,000 worth of paint on those . And probably another $2,000 on the floor . " And artists today face increased competition , more than previous generations . The 1980 census cites some 199,000 people who " make a living " at painting or sculpting ( and that 's not to mention those who do n't make a living ) . The summer gallery guide of Art in America last year listed 14,000 artists with gallery affiliations . Between 1970 and 1976 , according to NEA statistics , the number of professional artists increased by 50 percent ? more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many are members of the " baby boom " generation , who came of age during the past two decades ? when money first played a major role in the American art world and figures like Warhol established the possibility of an upscale lifestyle as an artist . A RT TODAY is no longer a bohemian activity , engaged in by kooks and misfits and dabbled in by the very rich . This generation 's artists share the aspirations of their upwardly mobile families , and their sensitivity to income potential has grown in a time of increasing economic hardship . " If young artists believe they 're going to make a living out of art , " says Hutchinson , " and that 's what the art schools teach them , it 's a different ball game from the artist who was doing it because he had to . " Indeed , such strongholds of the avant-garde as Cal Arts and the Visual Arts Department of the University of California at San Diego include not just aesthetics but commerce in their curriculum : " presenting " work to dealers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a stronger hunger for this kind of material , " says Martin Van Buren , acting dean of the Critical Studies Department at Cal Arts . " Students now are less uncomfortable with marketing and packaging themselves . They want to know how to go public . " But even before the current economic crunch , the purist educational art enclaves were spawning " fast track " artists ? like David Salle . Born in Oklahoma , Salle , now thirty , grew up in Wichita , Kansas , where his parents are both in business . He attended Ca ! Arts and has shrewdly made use of the lessons he learned there . Cal Arts is a bastion of formalism and concept-based art , but Salle uses formalism the way a speculator trades in commodities . " Being a good artist means making a successful reading of art history , " he says . During the 1960s , formalist painters announced that painting was dead . Salle 's " reading " of art his tory led him to agree : hence , he creates " dead " paintings , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line figures , and pictorial art-history " quotes " are superimposed on each other as comments on the " impossibility " of painting . ( One recent painting features his name in bold letters , like the opening credits of a TV show . ) Some critics , like Peter Schjeldahl of Vanity Fair , find Salle 's work " literary " and playful . Robert Hughes of Time calls it " dismal . " Boone at first found Salle 's work " difficult , " but signed him up in 1978 . In the spring of 1982 , Salle was the second artist awarded a Boone-Castelli joint show , with a snazzy opening attended by " attractive crowds " who drank " champagne from real stemware on real silver trays , " according to Schjeldahl . Salle 's paintings now sell for as much as $35,000 . " David knew the rules of the art game , " says a Cal Arts friend , " and he was determined to play by them and win . " 0 F COURSE , " art stars " ? such as Salle and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are nothing new . Ever since Renaissance artists dropped the guise of the anonymous craftsman , artists have , to some extent , sought fame and fortune , and there have always been interested parties to help them along . And trends in the art world rise and fall in rapid succession . One thing is new : the eclipse of the purist , transcendental sensibility of Western art , and of modernism , which has dominated art since the 1880s . And the gulf between highbrow art and commercial entertainment , which Clement Greenberg identified forty years ago , has now been bridged by " crossover " artists , members of the first generation to have grown up with television and all that it promised in the way of success and mass appeal . " These arc the TV babies , " observes Soho art dealer Holly Solomon . The great crossover " smash hit " has been thirty-six-year-old Laurie Anderson , the New Wave perfor mance artist celebrated in The New York Times Magazine , Rolling Stone , People , and even airline magazines . A magna cum laude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and criticism . In the mid-1970s she began doing quirky performance pieces ( like Duet on Ice , in which she stood on a block of ice and played cowboy tunes on a violin in tandem with a cassette recorder concealed in the instrument ) . Since then her pieces have grown in complexity and use of technology ; the twoevening-long United States , Parts I-IV , recently performed at the Brooklyn Academy of Music , involved rear-projection slides , sixteen-millimeter films , and a variety of dazzling devices , including a harmonizer and a vocoder , which transformed her voice into that of a man , a baby , or a choir . Anderson signed a recording contract last year with Warner Brothers and released an album , Big Science . Anderson says , however , that she never intentionally courted mainstream success . " It was n't my fantaHaRPER's/JuLY 1983 70 sy to be stared at on the street " Yet her slick electronic works have moved effortlessly from art galleries to rock clubs to a national tour . And her well-packaged wit stands in stark relief against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was never interested in the bare-bones stuff , " she says . " The pieces have structure , but if that shows as the first thing , I feel I 've failed . They 're more involved with asking questions , with the sensual reasons for things . " Anderson 's seductive , brainy nihilism ( stream-of-consciousness autobiographical monologues , wordplay , etc. ) is a lesson in how art world sensibility can be highly commercial . During the Seventies " the richest artists were recording artists , " writes New Wave pundit Glenn O'Brien , music critic for Warhol 's Interview magazine , " and they had all of the drugs and all of the boys and all of the girls and all of the fans , and the restless fine artists noticed . " In the mid-Seventies , white , middle-class art school vets like Bryan Ferry ( England ) and David Byrne and Patti Smith ( U.S. ) created the genre of New Wave music . Soon others dropped their paintbrushes , changed their hairstyles , donned black leather jackets , and formed rock groups and " art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jerks , the Cramps , the Bush Tetras . Never mind that most could n't play their instruments . They were rock stars for an evening , living proof of Warhol 's twenty-year-old prediction that in the future everyone would be famous for fifteen minutes . In 1975 , CBGB , a rock club on the Bowery , booked Patti Smith and Tom Verlaine ; the next year it mixed New Wave with art , featuring . William Burroughs and video artist Nam June Paik . By 1977 , Max 's Kansas City , a club north of ' Union Square , was blending rock , New Wave , art bands , avant-garde films , performance art , and poetry readings . Hurrah , an uptown club , offered " art nights . " New clubs sprang up all over Manhattan : the Mudd Club , the Ritz , Tier 3 , the Peppermint Lounge , all featuring rock and performance art , fashion shows , video tapes , and New Wave art exhibitions . By 1981 , even the Kitchen , home of relentlessly austere programming ( like music pitched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Seventies , began booking New Wave bands and " rap groups " like Fab Five Freddy . " It was like Leo Castelli , but different haircuts , " says Rhys Chatham , who founded and ran the Kitchen 's music program until 1980 . The club scene was vaguely ridiculous : artists could flirt with black leather and greasy haircuts in a low-risk , late-night environment . Still , it provided many artists in their early twenties with a place to show their work outside the closed gallery system . " The galleries were too restrictive , " says Beth B , of the underground filmmaking team Scott and Beth B. " Everyone just sat and analyzed . They exist to promote the careers of a few individuals . We want to communicate beyond the art world . " Scott and Beth B began their career by showing Super-8 films at Max 's Kansas City , drawing on art and club world figures for their casts . Since then , their first sixteen-millimeter film , Vortex , has been featured at the New York Film Festival . It stars Lydia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jerks , as a punkette detective whose office is a bathtub . Graffiti artist Keith Haring is another graduate of the club scene . Born in Kutztown , in the heart of Pennsylvania Dutch country , Haring moved to New York in 1978 to study at the School of Visual Arts . His first New York exhibition was in 1980 at Club 57 in the East Village , where the art school graduates who manage the club scheduled " theme nights , " a whimsical , cabaret-style format ( later picked up by the Mudd Club , among others ) for artists . Last year , Haring , now twenty-five , was the youngest artist in Germany 's prestigious " Documenta 7 " exhibition , and his works currently sell for up to 510,000 . Haring recently had a one-man exhibit at the Soho gallery of Tony Shafrazi ? like Boone , one of the new generation of gallery owners . There 's a certain affinity between Haring and Shafrazi , who is rather a graffiti artist in his own right : in 1974 , he was arrested for defacing Picasso @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out for spectators as he was led away ) . Haring 's own work is also " political , " and last June he was arrested by the New York City transit police for plying his trade in the subways . T HE young Post-Modernists in general are also , after a fashion , " political . " Unlike their formalist predecessors , they are constantly expressing " themes " ? the horror of nuclear war , the ridiculousness of Ronald Reagan , the tensions of male-female relationships . They rely on satire , shock images ( tortured faces , dismembered mannequins , blood ) and " found " kitsch ( " Ozzie and Harriet " reruns , archaic slang ) . And the effect is often impressive . Yet beneath the Post-Modernist veneer is little besides a glassy-eyed drive ? posturing instead of passion , mixed-and-matched styles learned from years of looking at slides in art school , repackaged artifacts of American mass culture . The art of previous decades may have been confused , self-indulgent , pompous . Often it was excruciatingly boring . It was also touchingly ambitious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but at least it began with a vision of exploring experience , not merely processing and packaging it . Perhaps Post-Modernism represents a transitional period in which art will begin to regain the emotion , sensuality , and humanity it scorned for much of the modernist period . Some observers , like Holly Solomon , see the current flurry of activity as a kind of " renaissance " in a nation with a very young art history . It remains to be seen whether New Wave , Neo-Expressionism , and Post-Pop , and their art world promoters will succeed in integrating the once marginal and purist art world into the mainstream of media culture , producing a glittery art elite to rival rock stars or soap-opera personalities .
