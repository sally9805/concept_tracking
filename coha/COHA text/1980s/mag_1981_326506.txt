Banisadr flees his enemies and sets up a command post in Paris <P> They were the two most wanted men in Iran , hunted for " high treason " by the vengeful mullahs around Ayatullah Ruhollah Khomeini . When darkness fell on Tehran on July 28 , Abolhassan Banisadr , the deposed President , and Massoud Rajavi , his ally and leader of the urban guerrillas known as the Mujahedin-e Khalq ( People 's Crusaders ) , slipped on stolen military uniforms and sneaked from their hideout into a small army van . They were driven to a military airfield , passing unrecognized through security controls ( Banisadr had shaved his familiar mustache ) , and boarded an Iranian air force Boeing 707 . <P> Waiting at the plane was Colonel Behzad Moezi , one of Iran 's most accomplished pilots and a man with a remarkable background . He flew the Shah into exile in January 1979 . But after growing sympathetic to the revolution , he returned to Iran and joined the Mujahedin . Suspected by the Ayatullah 's entourage , Moezi in effect was grounded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help of Banisadr , Moezi had flown more combat missions than any other Iranian pilot . <P> Eight days earlier , Moezi had filed a routine training flight plan with authorities . Now , with his passengers aboard , Moezi prepared to take off . A crew member who was not part of the plot nearly came across Banisadr , who was in the rear of the aircraft , but two other crewmen who had joined the conspirators seized the man . When a second innocent member of the crew came looking for the first , he too was grabbed . Precisely at 10:30 p.m. , the big jet began to trundle slowly down the runway . Only then were the two captives released and told of their special cargo : " It 's the President . " <P> Once aloft , Moezi veered from the flight plan he had filed and headed west . The plane was actually over Turkey when it was caught by three Iranian Phantom jets . The fighter pilots radioed threats to shoot down the tanker but did not fire . One likely explanation : the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rajavi : " Had it been any other pilot than Moezi , we would have died . " <P> At 4:30 a.m. , Moezi landed at a military airfield in Evreux , 55 miles west of Paris . After 43 days in hiding , Banisadr was free . But the entourage had to wait at the airport for four hours until French officials , fearing retaliation against some 100 French citizens still in Iran , extracted a written pledge from Banisadr and Rajavi forswearing any political activity involving their home country . <P> <P> Flak-jacketed police then escorted the pair to Banisadr 's old apartment in Cachan , a middle-class suburb of Paris , where he lived during most of his 16 years of exile from the Shah 's regime . " I will stay here until the people of Iran find the path to democracy , " Banisadr told a throng of reporters outside his home . At week 's end he moved temporarily to a friend 's home in northern Paris , apparently for security reasons .             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
