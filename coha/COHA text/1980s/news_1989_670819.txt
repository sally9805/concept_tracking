Once the exclusive domain of scientists and engineers , supercomputing is moving into more conventional commercial applications like the management of rental-car reservations and the development of financial models as well as the processing of transactions like credit card charges. // These are the classic uses of large mainframe computers , which excel in moving and sorting large volumes of data . Supercomputers specialize in performing mathematically intensive processing operations to solve very complex problems rapidly. // But both users and producers are finding that the supercomputer technology called parallel processing , in which tasks are broken up and distributed among multiple computer processors , accelerates some business software as well as it does scientific programs . Parallel processing overcomes the speed limits of individual processors ; theoretically , four processors handle a problem almost four times as fast as one. // // ' Scared a Lot of People ' // " It ' s just become reasonable recently for people to develop data base software on parallel processors , " said David DeWitt , a professor of computer science at the University of Wisconsin . " Before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardware company as Teradata did , and that scared a lot of people off. " // Mr. DeWitt noted that Tandem Computers Inc. , a pioneer in the use of multiple processors , has rewritten portions of its Non-Stop SQL data base software to run in parallel , and that the International Business Machines Corporation is taking a similar approach to its mainframe data base product , DB-2. // Some simple parallel systems have been used in business since the early 1980 ' s , but the announcement last week by the Oracle Corporation that it would write a version of its leading data base software for a machine with more than 8 , 000 processors was a kind of watershed for the technology . Oracle ' s relational data base program , which can find sets of related records simultaneously , is used by thousands of companies in a range of industries. // " A number of large Oracle customers are extremely interested in the commercial use of supercomputers , " said Peter Tierney , Oracle ' s vice president for marketing , explaining why Oracle will produce software for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Ore. // Mr. Tierney said that the first customers would probably be in the petroleum and military industries , which are already big supercomputer users , but that there was also interest from financial service , transportation and hospitality companies. // Jeffrey Canin , an independent supercomputer analyst in San Francisco , said : " Parallel processing is not a controversial issue anymore . Companies with the credibility of Oracle blessing this architecture will make it safe for other kinds of applications. " // There is ample precedent for supercomputers moving into the commercial arena . Nearly every new computer architecture has first been adopted by the scientific community , which is more willing to take risks to gain performance , and then by business . Perhaps the best example is the Digital Equipment Corporation ' s Vax minicomputer , which started as an engineer ' s tool but became a successful general-purpose computer. // Indeed , Gordon Bell , the chief designer of the Vax and now a vice president with the Ardent Computer Corporation , said parallel processing would gradually take over commercial computing . " It ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no reason it won ' t happen in commercial areas , " he said . Only the conservatism of commercial users and their investment in existing software would slow the change , he said. // But some analysts are skeptical , noting that converting software to run on a parallel system is not easy , even for scientific users . Within the broad field of parallel processing , machines run from four to eight processors to as many as 64 , 000 in " massively parallel " systems , and some may be better suited to business than others. // " It is going to be a number of years before true parallel processing machines are really considered mainstream architecture , " said Gary Smaby , an analyst with Needham &; Company in Minneapolis . " There are certain types of problems that can be broken up very cleanly across multiple processors , but most common programs don ' t lend themselves to that. " // Most analysts say the machines most likely to gain a foothold in the commercial market are the so-called mini-supercomputers , typically priced from $300 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those of Cray Research Inc. , which range in price from $5 million to $25 million . A Cray spokesman said that while the company ' s machines were sometimes used to run commercial software , they were not bought for that purpose . He added that Cray was not aiming for that market. // One maker of parallel systems that has focused on the commercial market is Sequent Computer Systems Inc. of Beaverton , Ore . Sequent ' s machines fall below the supercomputer level , but offer faster performance than comparably priced minicomputers by linking up to 30 microprocessors of the type commonly used singly in personal computers. // C. Scott Gibson , Sequent ' s president and chief operating officer , said the company ' s computers offer " practical parallel. " // " We wanted our parallel machines to be out there living and breathing in real applications , " he said . Sequent ' s customers include the Internal Revenue Service , which uses Oracle software to respond to taxpayer questions , and the Radisson Hotel Company , which coordinates reservations for 200 hotels using an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ systems have also created new types of applications . The Teradata Corporation of Los Angeles produces a specialized data base supercomputer using up to 268 processors . Teradata ' s machines can be linked to the mainframes or minicomputers of other companies and are used primarily for decision support , which Richard Van Hoesen , a spokesman , defines as " the ability to take large amounts of information and manipulate and aggregate it in such a way that it ' s usable. " // Teradata counts many large companies among its customer base , including Citibank , K Mart and A.T. &; T. " This is mainstream big business , " Mr. Van Hoesen said . " The reason we ' re in there is we ' re enabling them to do things they know they need to do and can ' t find any other way to do. " // Mr. Van Hoesen uses a deck of cards as an analogy for a computer data base to explain why parallel processing works so well . If one person is asked , for example , to find all the sixes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take a minute or more . Four people each shuffling through 13 cards would reduce the task to seconds , and 52 people could accomplish the task in an instant . The same is true of computer processors searching a data base. // Thinking Machines Inc. of Cambridge , Mass. , has also moved beyond scientific problems to business applications . The company recently sold two of its 64 , 000-processor computers , dubbed the Connection Machine , to Dow Jones &; Company for a new electronic information retrieval service called Dow Quest . This service lets an unskilled user browse rapidly through a vast library of information from business newpapers and magazines. // " What goes on behind that is a huge computation that just could not be done on a sequential machine in a reasonable amount of time , " said Danny Hillis , Thinking Machines ' chief scientist . In such applications the issue of converting existing software to run in parallel is not relevant , " because you didn ' t have old software to do that , " he said. // " We ourselves look more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have found that the distinction between science and business applications is not black and white . Business tasks may rely on algorithms similar to engineering programs , and many scientific tasks require just as much data base management as commercial jobs do. // " Many problems you find in business can be adapted to high-performance ' scientific ' machines like ours , " said Frank Vince , vice president for marketing at the Convex Computer Corporation in Richardson , Tex. , the leading maker of mini-supercomputers . The advantage is the " ability to do much more work in a given period , " he said . Many business applications , like financial modeling , are actually scientific in nature , he added. // Justin Rattner , director of technology for Intel Scientific Computers , agreed . " Even though the problems are different in business , the math is very similar to problems we ' ve already tackled in science , " he said . But the value of parallel processing in business remains very application-dependent , he added . " Parallel machines really shine when you ' re doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up an I.B.M. for hours , " he said . <> <> Wider Uses for the Big Machines <> For the past decade supercomputers have been used almost exlusively for scientific applications .
