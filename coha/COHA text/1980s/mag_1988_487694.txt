Back in Warsaw after my trip to Gdansk , I talk about the economy with the outgoing government 's spokesman on reform . He is more specific on what is to be done than on how it should be achieved . Stalinist coercion must be replaced by the direction of the economy through financial incentives . He raises the question of ownership ? interesting , since private property accounts for about 7 percent of the gross national product outside agriculture , and public ownership is likely to predominate for some time to come . Yet what form will that ownership take : communal , cooperative or collective ? And if collective , will it be run by the workers , by a share-owning management , by whom ? He either does not perceive the social and political consequences of the various choices or does not want to talk about them . While mocking the almost religious awe with which the market is now treated in Poland , he offers me a scoop with the utmost pride : In the government that Prime Minister Mieczyslaw Rakowski is to announce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , head of a joint-venture firm with foreign capital , is a " real millionaire . " To watch the government 's inauguration I proceed to the sejm , or diet , a big white building that stands where it did Daniel Singer is The Nation 's correspondent in Europe . This is the second installment of a two-part article . before the war but has been modernized with a glass rotunda . It is a sort of pilgrimage for me : My father , a parliamentary commentator , exercised his wit there against Marshal Jozef Pilsudski and the colonels , whose regime is now being prettified by the nostalgic portion of the opposition . I can not quite recall Byron 's lines about giving the pugnacious Poles a diet , then telling them to keep quiet . In the elegant hall dunng the recess I get quite close to Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski . He walks as if he has swallowed a stick ; I am sure he must be wearing a corset . Next to him , recognizable by his big ears , is Jerzy Urban , the skilled journalist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the most hated man in the country . Rakowski has just finished his speech , which is considered modern and original because it lasted only thirty minutes . Its true originality lay , in fact , in the way this well-known anticleric wooed the Catholic hierarchy , quoting Jozef Cardinal Glemp and promising to provide rapidly what the church had been awaiting a long time  --  legal status for its property . The new Prime Minister did mention a " historic compromise , " only between party and church , not Solidarity . The line was clearly shifting . In his press conference next day , Rakowski stressed that Poles were less concerned with a roundtable than with a table laden with goods . But what Warsaw wits ironically call the " Korean solution " ? military dictatorship plus a free market ? is just not on . Gorbachevism is not a favorable environment for a further tightening of political screws , and foreign capital will not pour in to boost production . Does appointment of a millionaire mean Rakowski is pinning his hopes on the moneymakers ? The Western @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Poland 's social landscape . On the plane in from Frankfurt I sat next to a handsome , bejeweled Polish woman who carried her capital on her arms and neck . She was returning from South Africa , with no qualms of conscience , and intended to buy a villa in the seaside resort of Sopot and open a restaurant . One evening in Warsaw a friend wanted to take us for a drink to Gessler and Sons , the fashionable cafe in the Saxon Garden , where two giant figures in armor stand guard at the gate . Inside , there was an open-air mime show and lots of " beautiful people . " We could n't stay : It was a private party . The bowler-hatted host , I was told , hovered somewhere on the frontier between government service and shady foreign trade . Booking the place , though it must have cost a fortune , was not unusual ; it was to be " closed " again the next day for a wedding party . Although this conspicuous consumption does shock one , the new rich are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the well off , who are estimated to be roughly 15 percent of the population . Many of these are connected in some way with the outside world because of the mad exchange rate . At the other extreme are an estimated 25 percent ? old-age pensioners , low-wage earners , large families with little income  --  close to the subsistence level . In between , a majority who just manage to make ends meet . The economic reform , if it works , is bound to polarize society further , with unforeseeable political consequences . At this stage , however , whatever the admiration for the Iron Lady , there is no room for a Polish version of Thatcherism ? privatization , gifts for the rich , the bribing of part of the working class , all amid a spurious air of prosperity . In Poland , where production and consumption are still below the levels of ten years ago , what is needed for the reforms to have a chance is a social contract with the labor movement . This Cardinal Glemp can not offer , whatever his good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Rakowski is likely to be a continuation of the crisis . The Beautiful Suit and Our Ugly World . Walking through Nowy Swiat I saw an advertisement at the Economists ' Club for a show of Jewish humor . Though it was a premiere and invitation-only , I managed to get a table by taking advantage of my father 's reputation . It was a one-man show , with the actor telling all sorts of Jewish jokes ? good , bad and indifferent ? not in Yiddish but in Polish with a phony Jewish accent . Yet if it all suddenly seemed sinister to me , this had nothing to do with the quality of the performance . It happened in the middle of one of my favorites , about the customer who complains to his tailor for taking a couple of weeks to finish a suit , while God took only seven days to create the world . " Look at this beautiful suit , " the tailor replies , " and look at the world . " This was worse than gallows humor ; it was wit in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vanished world . We were within shouting distance of the ghetto , in a town where Jews once numbered more than 350,000 . When the show was over I looked at the sixty or so people in the hall , most of them women : Here were the remnants of a tribe . The nice young couple at our table happened not to be Jewish . The man was here because his firm was taping the show ( 60,000 cassettes and more to come , things Jewish being fashionable these days ) . The subject of conversation was unavoidable . They had thought Claude Lanzmann 's Shoah unfair , almost racist , in lumping all Poles together , though they did not deny the present shameful Polish phenomenon of anti-Semitism without Jews . They thought it would die out together with the prewar generations , while admitting that some of their contemporaries still echoed the anti-Semitic stereotypes of their parents . Marek Edelman , the heroic and lonely survivor of the Warsaw ghetto , whom I met a couple of days later , agreed . Indeed , he thought anti-Semitism would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obviously referring to such sins as the anti-Semitic campaign of 1968 , I asked him about the Jewish presence in the government , specifically about Jerzy Urban . " Oh no . He has achieved the feat of being hated for himself . " Let there be no misunderstanding . The Jewish question is , unfortunately , unimportant in Poland , merely a symptom . I bring it up here as a means of conveying the right-wing revival within the Polish intelligentsia . The 1981 military coup , the absence of a progressive solution , the government 's determination to talk with the church and not with the labor movement , have all contributed to this swing to the right . If the French tend to look at the past through the prism of the present , the Poles allow the ghosts of the past to walk upon their political stage . Marshal Pilsudski has his followers in today 's Poland ; they have made him synonymous with national independence and , hence , opposition to the Soviet Union . Roman Dmowski , prewar leader of the anti-Semitic National Democracy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or endecja ) , less hostile to the Soviet Union and the regime , and the more conservative Catholic groups that have flirted with the government tend to define Polishness in ethnic and religious terms . Jan Jozef Lipski , the morally strong and personally gentle literary critic , guides me through this political panorama of the opposition . He moves on to a third group , his own Polish Socialist Party , or P.P.S. " Socialism , alas , is not a very popular word because of guilt by association . The P.P.S. fares somewhat better as it is not linked with ' them . ' Altogether , however , Solidarity has tended to be anarchosyndicalist in this respect and mistrust people linked with any party . This is why some of my colleagues from the lay left chose not to follow the same path . " Lipski 's colleagues do n't deny it , convinced that real party politics is still to come . Of Poland 's established institutions , the Communist Party represents postwar history and the imperatives of geography ; the Catholic Church stands for tradition , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But who will represent the interests of private peasants ? And will Solidarity again manage to speak for the bulk of the working class ? How will the intelligentsia divide ? At present no side can seriously measure its own strength . One acute opposition analyst thinks the regime , while it lasts , can rely on the support of 15 to 20 percent of the population , and Solidarity , at this stage , on 25 to 30 percent . The remainder , while hostile to the regime , thinksnothing can be done about it . If a compromise is reached and gradual change becomes a tangible possibility , this silent majority could ask for everything at once . As the economic reform begins to bite , as questions over the nature of power and property in the factories are tackled , cleavages will deepen . Solidarity will not be spared . Some of its economic experts , with Milton Friedman as their guru , may for now appear to be ascendant . But they will find it difficult to preach the virtues of political suicide to a labor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mills and the mines . If the party had the imagination and guts to recognize Solidarity , sharp tensions would appear at once within the opposition over the degree of collaboration with the regime and the nature of economic policy . As it is , the only open divisions are those within the C.P. Two Kinds of Commissar . In the party building at the corner of Jerusalem Avenue and New World Street , I meet a friendly high-level official in the propaganda department of the Central Committee Offered the choice of languages , he opts for English and its handicap . He also takes me for an innocent abroad . When he says in an introductory statement that Stalin described socialism as suited for Poland like a saddle for a cow , I make the mistake of correcting him : Stalin said revolution , not socialism , and he was talking about Germany , not Poland . Yet it was not here that things went wrong . In his passionate version of recent history , which rather baffled me , everything was the handiwork of the C.P. , including the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I understood after a time , was to brush aside my suggestion of a compromise between the two sides . The party was ready to talk to society at large , of which Solidarity was only a small fraction . And not all of Solidarity at that . The names Jacek Kuron and Adam Michnik provoked his wrath ; they would never sit round the conference table . And if your party decided otherwise ? Never . Then , after a very long reflection : Unless they changed their position altogether . His veto was not limited to these two intellectual advisers of Solidarity . It also applied to the union leader from Wroclaw , Wladislaw Frasyniuk , whom he accused of having promised , when strong enough , to " kick the Communists out of factories . " I had never heard such a threat . In any case , I argued , who gains the upper hand on the shop floor is a question of genuine influence , not of boasting . He replied , banging the table : " It is provided in the Constitution that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has the right to be present in the factories . " In fact the Constitution provides for nothing of the kind . This was simply my propagandist 's interpretation of the passage about the party 's crucial role in the state . But I was no longer arguing , we were getting along much better . Just before leaving I asked him what , in his opinion , socialism stood for at this stage . The answer was prompt and brief : efficiency . No more controversy , so I waited until I had reached the street before muttering to myself : Only this and nothing more . . While the party building is huge , if not architecturally striking , the seat of PRON , a front organization for the regime in the vast Ujazdowskie Avenue , is very different ? a small , elegant villa that presumably was once the property of a rich landowner . PRON 's Secretary General , Stanislaw Ciosek , is not quite 50 . He is a party Secretary who climbed the ladder as a student and youth leader , negotiated with Solidarity and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Flexible and known as a pragmatist , he has a quite different power of imagination from the man in the propaganda department . The question on compromise does not throw him off his stride : Socialism in its Stalinist or post-Stalinist versions has dragged us out of backwardness ; let 's leave it to the historians to decide whether the price paid was too high . But this social formation is now a spent force and is being reshaped throughout the region . Our pioneering task in Poland is to include the opposition in the socialist system . Without any prompting from me , he raises the question of what socialism now means and , unfashionably , tackles the problem of equality : A few months ago , he says , I watched a TV debate on private education . A monthly fee of 25,000 zlotys per child was mentioned . I have two kids and at the time ? salaries have gone up since ? I was earning 82,000 zlotys as a Deputy Prime Minister . . . . The opposition has changed , we have changed and so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into account that our people now refuse any form of servitude . Historians will puzzle one day over how a totalitarian system could produce such a democratic people . . . . Naturally , he tries to score some points . He argues , quite rightly , that this year 's strikers were fighting against injustice and asking for dignity . But when I observe that their only concrete demand was for an independent union , Solidarity , he does not press the point . What , except for a party card , does he have in common with my diehard from the propaganda department ? The fear of unleashing uncontrollable social forces and the desire for a neat solution imposed from above . By the party . He makes it quite plain that an immediate deal is off . ( " Trade-union pluralism is acceptable . But not yet . For the moment it is too explosive . " ) Later , in the taxi taking my wife , Jeanne , and me to the airport , I reflect on the obstacles that lie ahead . A concrete proposal for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Ciosek , with 60 percent of seats going to the party and 40 percent to the opposition . But nobody in Solidarity will accept this . A farce , electoral or otherwise , does not cease to be one just because you have joined it . What rules of the game can be established to give some guarantees at the top and yet allow the movement from below ultimately to shape the fate of the country ? My building of castles in Spain is sharply interrupted by Polish reality . At the airport , after the passport check , we are taken aside . Two officers pounce on our luggage Anything printed , all notebooks and tapes , the film of the May strike in Gdansk , are taken for inspection to some mysterious higher authority . The suitcase and our bags are thoroughly examined , including the linings . Jeanne and I are taken , separately , to a cubicle for a personal search . Two men check under my cap , in my socks , beneath my shirt , inside my trousers . After a couple of hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience if I were writing a thriller . As it is , it 's a useful reminder that power is not just an abstraction . Afterthoughts . Once airborne , the plane is less on my mind than Arthur Rimbaud 's drunken boat , le bateau ivre . Can a ship sail into uncharted waters without a compass and without a vision of some distant horizon ? Paradoxical Poland , where " Communist " leaders publicly envy Margaret Thatcher 's ability to cope with the labor movement ; where the scourge of the British miners parades as a defender of trade unionism ; and where the supporters of Solidarity in Gdansk , prospective victims of " restructuring , " applaud the Iron Lady , its apostle . A better example of the Tower of Babel would be hard to find . And yet Poland is only the extreme example of Eastern Europe 's intellectual disarray . The entire region is in transition . Its rulers visibly act only by conditioned reflexes , and one-party rule is justified by nothing more than the perpetuation of power . Public ownership and some form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too big a word ) are justified through the same reason , by the need of a nomenklatura to give jobs to the boys . For the moment , on both sides of the fence , the market is the new religion . One emerges convinced that all these countries will have to travel further toward a market economy , and not only to clear away the mess , to rediscover some yardstick after years of miscalculation , to provide more transparence ? glasnost  --  in order to see who is exploiting whom and how . The change is also needed for people to perceive the vices of our Western system as well as of their own , for Eastern Europe 's social movements to find their bearings and their political expression . How long that will take and how the process must run will vary from country to country , but the conservative admirers of Solidarity may well be in for some unpleasant surprises . Even if right-wing elements sometimes give the impression of gaining the upper hand , especially in moments of defeat and retreat , the Polish labor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One is struck in Poland by the degree of freedom of expression , not only in the spoken but in the written word , not only underground but in official publications . " Daniel , you know Poland , " I was scolded by my friends in the opposition . " You ought to know that politically that 's irrelevant . " Disagreeing profoundly , I recalled the old story of the East German political satirist who is hounded from his own country , sets up a successful political cabaret in West Germany and remains ac 2. : , - ; , cmy as ever : " There I could say nothing but it mattered ;  - -  e I can say everything and it does n't . " Whether or not this was ever true in Germany , it is manifestly not the case in Poland The problem is not just freedom of speech but how to use that freedom to drive people to action . Let us illustrate the argument . Amid the recent Polish talk of possible collaboration , the question arose of common lists , joint commissions and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1981 at the height of Solidarity and the fashion for self-government . Indeed , the second chamber was intended to be the expression at a national level of the workers ' councils that were to be set up throughout the country . The first chamber , by granting political power , was supposed to recognize geopolitical realities ; the second , even with limited prerogatives on economic and social issues , was to express the legitimacy of the labor movement . This institutionalization of dual power was conceived as the best framework for a " creeping revolution . " Today the situation is quite different . Workers ' councils do exist , but in most cases they are a parody of self-government . It is easy , therefore , to dismiss official proposals on the ground that building a second chamber on such a false basis would simply discredit a precious idea . But what if a second house took shape in two or three years ' time , after authentic workers ' councils had been set up throughout the country ? Let there be no illusion : Self-government in itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to restructure industry , Solidarity could use the platform of self-government to tackle both the problem of property and power in the workplace and that of democratic planning on a national scale . Naturally , it is easier to stand defensively ? as Solidarity 's present leaders often do ? on the slogans of independence and pluralism , but that is not the way to forge the future . " Really existing socialism " is at the end of its tether . Though it is unclear what will take its place , it would be a pity if socialists failed to take part in the contest for lack of ideas . Poland can continue to play a pioneering role in this vast process of transition because , since 1970 , its working class has reminded the world that in Eastern Europe too the future can be shaped from below . And the Polish labor movement is not a spent force . I ended my journey with the contrasting impression that while the immediate perspective is of a political impasse , some form of compromise is historically inevitable . Unless , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their immediate survival , provoke the angry young proles into desperate action and drown all hopes in blood . ?
