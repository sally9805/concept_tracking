As the New Year dawned , Mexico was bracing itself for a painful reality . Jan. 1 marked the start of the Pact for Economic Stabilization and Growth , the latest package of wage and price controls intended to help keep Mexico 's inflation rate below 20% . But it will probably pinch workers , whose real earnings have fallen steadily since 1982 , and add further stress to an economy already staggering under more than $100 billion in foreign debt . <P> The implications could be explosive . Three days after President Carlos Salinas de Gortari announced the belt-tightening measures last month , hundreds of government workers demanding pay increases stormed the legislature shouting antigovernment slogans . Thousands more demonstrated in the streets of the city . At his inauguration Salinas , who won a clouded election by the narrowest margin in the 59-year history of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party , again called for a reduction in Mexico 's debt payments . " The interests of Mexicans , " said he , " come before those of the creditors . " Yet Salinas ' ability to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the threatening political consequences of domestic austerity . <P> Salinas ' is but one voice in what has become a rising chorus of debtor discontent . Crippled by stagnant growth and a combined foreign debt of more than $400 billion , Latin American governments are finding it increasingly unacceptable to shoulder interest payments for loans that only push them deeper into the red . Yet the banks that made the loans , many of them privately held U.S. institutions , have come up with few acceptable solutions . <P> For the U.S. Government , the ticking of the debt bomb is no less disturbing . In the 1980s new democracies laboriously replaced dictatorships in more than half a dozen Latin American countries . In Argentina the third military uprising in 20 months was dispelled ; shortly afterward , soldiers won a 20% pay hike . By sweeping municipal elections in Brazil 's major cities last November , the left posed a credible political threat to the government of President Jose Sarney . With nearly a dozen Latin American debtor nations scheduled to hold presidential elections in the next two years , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to break the debt squeeze . Unless the region 's scarce capital can be shifted away from foreign- debt payment back into economic growth , the frail bloom of democracy could wither . <P> In humanitarian terms , the picture is equally grim . In its annual report , the United Nations Children 's Fund blames the debt crisis for lowering the quality of life for almost 900 million people over the past decade . If the current trend continues , UNICEF warns , the debt problem will cause the deaths of 18 million children a year by the end of the century .
