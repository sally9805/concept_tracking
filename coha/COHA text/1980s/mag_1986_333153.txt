" This is not a cure . We do n't want to overpromise to the thousands of people who have AIDS . " Robert Windom , of the Department of Health and Human Services , chose his words carefully as he faced the press in Washington last ! week , determined not to raise any false hopes . Despite Windom 's caution , the dramatic news he reported was bound to be en couraging to AIDS victims around the world : early results of clinical tests with an experimental drug called azidothymidine ( AZT ) had shown that it slowed the attack of the AIDS virus and seemed to prolong the lives of many of its victims . <P> The results were so remarkable , Windom said , that tests in a dozen medical centers were being halted so that control groups of AIDS sufferers  --  who had been receiving only placebos , or dummy drugs  --  could immediately begin treatment with AZT . Furthermore , Windom has petitioned the Food and Drug Administration for speedy approval to distribute the drug to thousands of other AIDS victims , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pneumonia ( PCP ) , a rare form of pneumonia that frequently afflicts AIDS patients . David Barry , vice president for research at Burroughs Wellcome , the pharmaceutical firm that produces the drug , stressed to reporters that AZT was " not a cure for AIDS but rather a treatment . " Over the next few months , he said , " we will be continuing a very intensive research program to answer critical questions about the drug . " <P> Across the country , nonetheless , the announcement set off a flurry of excitement and controversy . AIDS hot lines and doctors ' offices were flooded with calls , community leaders warned about undue optimism , and doctors debated the ethical and medical issues raised by the early cancellation of the AZT study . <P> That study , designed by Burroughs Wellcome Co. in collaboration with medical specialists and AIDS experts , began in February and was scheduled to end in December ; it involved 282 subjects . Some were victims of AIDS who during the previous four months had also suffered their first bout of PCP . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were infected with the AIDS virus , their symptoms were not as severe as those of full-blown AIDS . Each patient took a capsule every four hours . For slightly more than half the group , those capsules contained AZT . For the control group , the capsules contained a placebo , a harmless , inactive substance . The tests were " double blind " to ensure that results would be interpreted objectively ; neither the doctors administering the tests nor the AIDS victims knew who was getting the real drug . That information was known only to a few Burroughs Wellcome officials , who monitored the results flowing in from the participating centers . <P> From the start , the company and an independent review board had agreed that if AZT proved to be toxic , the patients would immediately be taken off the drug and the test halted . But if AZT turned out to be clearly beneficial , it would immediately be offered to those patients who had been receiving only the placebo  --  which would in effect also terminate the study . But everyone , including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was reasonably confident that the study would run its full course . Said King before the results were known : " It 's going to have to be one extraordinary effect to stop that trial . "
