As the audience fills the cavernous chapel of Atlanta 's Spelman College to hear Presidential Aspirant Jesse Jackson , Nils Kongshaug of CBS News is already seated in the back , notebook at the ready , savoring the gospel choir . " One thing that 's great about the Jackson campaign is the music , " observes Kongshaug , who has been traveling with the candidate since January . " Sometimes I 'm disappointed when the gospel music ends and Jackson begins . " Still , Kongshaug quickly adds , having to sit through the same impassioned speech several times a day is better than his previous CBS assignment , answering phones for the Evening News . <P> Meet the latest innovation in network political coverage : the off-air reporter-producer and all-around campaign shadow . With no front runners and no bottomless buckets of money , the networks decided at the outset against deploying a correspondent and camera crew with each of the 13 candidates . But ABC and CBS still wanted a daily presence on the campaign bus . So each created high-tech updates of the newspaper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expensive , the tyros have been assigned , in campaign parlance , to stick with the " body . " From Iowa to New Hampshire and across the South , these body watchers have doggedly followed their men , briefing higher-ranking correspondents and producers , who use the on-scene intelligence for broader , more thematic coverage . " If you want to know how Dick Gephardt 's speech is different today from yesterday , " says CBS 's Terry Stewart , 29 , " you are not going to ask Dan Rather . You 're going to ask Terry Stewart . " <P> In fact , the minutiae of what the shadows know make them a valued resource for the rest of the press corps as well .

Nonstop involvement with a campaign can cause problems ; executives back in New York City have occasionally had to warn about getting too close to a candidate . But the body watchers ' unceasing presence has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weeks ago , ABC 's Dan Noyes , 29 , previously a producer on Good Morning America , instructed a cameraman to shoot Dole Campaign Chairman William Brock talking to two top aides . Later that day the aides told him Brock had fired them while ABC was filming . Noyes quickly got an affiliate station to tape an interview . That night World News Tonight was the only show to feature pictures of the firing with comments from one of the aides . <P> The emergence of local TV news and communications satellites help make the new system possible . With local stations picking up each candidate wherever he goes , the blanket network coverage of previous years is redundant . If major news occurs when a network camera is not rolling , the candidate watcher can send in tape from a local affiliate via satellite the same day . " Local stations have become so reliable , " says Joseph Angotti , chief of NBC 's election coverage , " that we do n't feel we need to have a correspondent and crew with the candidate all the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any campaign until after last month 's New Hampshire primary .
