" The first generation had patience , " says Sheik Ahmad Yasin , reclining on the floor of a chilly room in his house in the Gaza Strip as he talks about Palestinian frustrations under Israeli rule . " But this patience will not be repeated by the new generation , " he adds , choosing his words with care lest he be arrested by the Israelis . Sheik Yasin , 51 , is a spiritual leader of the Islamic fundamentalist movement in Gaza and thus a prime force behind the religious gale that has recently fanned the flames of unrest in the occupied territories . <P> Born in the Arab village of Al-Joura , Sheik Yasin has been paralyzed below the neck since age 15 as the result of an athletic accident . He resides with his wife and eleven children in a one-story house in Gaza City . Family members assist him in dressing and eating . Despite his handicap , he runs al-Mujama al- Islami , a community organization that builds mosques and sponsors cultural activities . <P> In 1984 Israeli authorities found an arms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and several dozen followers were charged with illegal possession of weapons and intent to destroy the state of Israel ; though he was sentenced to 13 years in jail , he was freed ten months later in a mass exchange of Palestinian political prisoners for Israeli POWs in Lebanon . <P> Bundled in a faded blanket and offering his visitors oranges and tea , Sheik Yasin decries the nationalist ideology of the Palestine Liberation Organization and instead insists that Palestinian aspirations can be realized only by creating an Islamic state . " If God wants an Islamic solution , then God 's wish will be implemented , " declares the sheik . He professes to have abandoned violence , but he adds confidently , " Believing in God and in Islam means having the readiness to die . "
