CBS schedules news at 2 a.m . <P> <P> Late-night television is a wasteland of old movies and shopworn reruns . But Ted Turner 's 24-hour cable news service has shown the networks that there is a big off-hours audience for news . Now CBS has moved to meet his challenge . Starting in September , it will offer its affiliate stations three hours of news weekdays between 2 a.m. and 5 a.m. , when a surprising 4.9 million of the nation 's 81 million TV households are still tuned in . Says Gene Jankowski , president of the CBS Broadcast Group : " CBS will be the first broadcast network on which news in effect will be available 24 hours a day . " <P> The new show will practically double the number of hours CBS News is on the air . It is a major step , perhaps the most important to date , in a trend that network executives have been predicting for several years : a growing network reliance on news , sports and other live events . The networks feel that their resources @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in these areas . But Turner 's improving Cable News Network already reaches 11.25 million homes . Another cable news service , jointly owned by ABC and Group W , starts June 21 in an estimated 2 million households . By that time , Turner 's second round-the-clock news service will be available to broadcast stations . This venture , called CNN2 , may pose the first serious challenge to the networks as exclusive providers of news to their affiliates . CNN2 's first broadcast customer : WBNS of Columbus , a CBS affiliate . <P> All this jockeying for the future is painfully costly in the present . Turner has lost an estimated $50 million . The ABC-Group W operation projects large initial losses . And CBS will not disclose how large an audience is needed to break even on its new service , which will cost an estimated $10 million annually . But among CBS affiliates there is widespread enthusiasm . The chairman of the affiliate board , James Babb , executive vice president of WBTV in Charlotte , N.C. , says : " If this is a way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benefits may not be easily measurable . " <P> The new show 's format , on-air personalities and content are still under debate at CBS . Despite plans for a relaxed morning-show style , the late-night news may take on a feisty chemistry all its own . The audience , notes CBS Vice President Tony Malara , will be primarily " insomniacs , shift people and people who watch a lot of television . " Those who appear for live interviews , adds News President Van Gordon Sauter , are likely " to have bizarre living patterns or something they desperately want to say . "
