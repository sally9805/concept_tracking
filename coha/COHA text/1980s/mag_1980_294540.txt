Hypoglycemia is being diagnosed too often <P> The symptoms seem to occur a few hours after meals : dizziness , weakness , tremors , sweating , even heart palpitations . Worried that they might have that " in " condition , hypoglycemia ( low blood sugar ) , the patients consult their physicians . More often than not , after a test or two , the doctors agree with the diagnosis and prescribe a restrictive , highprotein , low-carbohydrate diet with frequent feedings . Indeed , hypoglycemia has reached epidemic proportions . Now some doctors are raising warning flags . They insist that the malady is largely illusory . <P> Sugar , in the form of glucose , is the body 's main source of fuel . Derived from all foods , but most quickly from carbohydrates , it is present in the blood in varying amounts at all times . Directly after meals , the glucose level rises . Then , as insulin secreted from the pancreas helps move sugar into cells , the glucose concentration drops . But in people with hypoglycemia it falls to an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , low blood sugar can be traced to tumors of the pancreas , liver disease or previous gastrointestinal surgery . But most of today 's cases are attributed to disturbances in sugar metabolism following meals . <P> The standard method of diagnosing hypoglycemia is the glucose tolerance test ( GTT ) . After an overnight fast , the patient is given a high-glucose solution to drink . Blood samples are then taken at intervals over the next five to six hours and analyzed to see if the glucose content drops below normal levels . <P> But many doctors believe the test does not diagnose hypoglycemia so much as cause it . For one thing , interpreting the results is difficult because no one is sure what the normal level of glucose really should be . Depending on the specialist , the lowest " normal " can be any point between 35 mg and 60 mg of glucose in 100 ml of blood . Doctors now stress that the diagnosis can not be based on numbers alone ; the data must be matched to symptoms . One study found values as low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Says Endocrinologist Simeon Margolis of Johns Hopkins University : " It does not mean anything if somebody 's blood sugar is lower than some arbitrary value . What matters is if low blood sugar produces ill effects . " <P> But some physicians believe that even if symptoms do show up , the test is so artificially structured that the results are suspect . Declares Internist Leonard Madison of Southwestern Medical School in Dallas : " Hypoglycemia is a normal response to the glucose tolerance test . Man was not built to take an overload of glucose like that . Look at it this way : if you run up a flight of stairs and find yourself short of breath , it does not mean you have heart disease . " Madison , like others , believes that the GTT should be junked in favor of taking glucose measurements after normal meals or when symptoms occur .
