Jimmy says the race is over . No , it is not , says Teddy <P> A the long , black Lincoln Continenal pulled up to the West Wing of the White House last week , presidential staff members gathered on the lawn and crowded onto the balconies of the adjacent old Executive Office Building . The occasion had all the drama of a summit conference , and , in a sense , that is what it was : Senator Edward Kennedy , wearing a diplomat 's dark blue suit , had come calling on President Jimmy Carter . For the first time in their bitter , seven-month contest for the Democratic presidential nomination , the candidates were meeting face to face . <P> By the rules of political tradition - and common sense-the purpose of Kennedy 's visit should have been peacemaking . The President , though battered by the deepening recession , had won 24 primaries to Kennedy 's ten . Carter had collected 1,964 delegates , 298 more than he needs for a first-ballot nomination at the Democratic National Convention in August and 725 more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 60% of the Democrats , however reluctantly , preferred Carter to Kennedy as their nominee for President . But when the Senator emerged 54 minutes later from the Oval Office , he declared with a broad smile that the struggle was not over . " I have every intention of continuing in this campaign as a candidate , " he said . " I am planning to be the nominee . " <P> At a brief meeting with reporters in the White House , Carter added to the air of unreality by insisting that his tense meeting with Kennedy had been a step toward " unity . " But even the President seemed puzzled by Kennedy 's behavior . Said Carter : " I am convinced that I will be nominated , and he is not convinced of that fact yet . " Then , with a note of wonderment in his voice , the President added : " I pointed out to him , and he agreed , that the primary season is now over . " <P> It had , in fact , ended two days earlier on " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the total , were chosen at primaries in eight states . Ironically for Kennedy , it turned out to be the best week of his campaign . He won five of the contests , including two of the three most important , in California and New Jersey ; Carter carried the third big state , Ohio . In all , Kennedy won 53% of the delegates at stake . Yet even as Carter suffered his worst defeats of the campaign , he still picked up 321 delegates , far more than he needed to sew up the nomination . <P> In anticipation of that victory , Carter last month ordered aides to stop speaking disparagingly of Kennedy and to take conciliatory steps that might make the Senator an ally in the campaign against Ronald Reagan . Thus there was no response when Kennedy attacked Carter as a " clone of Ronald Reagan " and said that the Administration 's economic policies were " alien to everything the Democratic Party stands for . " Rosalynn Carter 's anger vibrated through the White House corridors when Joan Kennedy archly told a reporter that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ White House because she was a " sophisticated lady " and held a master 's degree in education . But in obedience to the presidential edict , the slur went unanswered .
