To hear Corbin Cianci tell it , the world has been living with compromise all the years it has gazed appreciatively down on its pretty snapshots . It even accepted black-and-white images as lifelike , until someone invented color photography . But now , says Cianci , we need no longer accept two-dimensional pictures of our three-dimensional world thanks to an odd-looking , four-lens camera called the Nimslo . Cianci , a slight man with delicate features and pale blue eyes , is the son of an Italian-American family from Boston ' s North End . His parents are lawyers and his father is a Republican politician ; they both still live over the European Restaurant on Hanover street . And , though Cianci is now an Atlantan and president of what may become the fastest-growing photographic company in the industry , his North End childhood friends , to this day his best friends , call him weekly , tracking him down wherever he is , at any hour . But now , wherever Cianci goes , even when he comes home to see his mother , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have never seen : pictures of people in tunnels , under waves , among a crowd of statues - each showing such depth you think you could feel the objects if you touched the film plane . Two years ago , Cianci was vice president of marketing at Polaroid Corp . A graduate of Boston College , he started at Polaroid selling cameras , one by one around New England . He stayed there 17 years and was , among other things , part of the team that launched the SX 70 camera . Cianci says he loved Polaroid and did not expect to leave the company . Then , one day , he met an inventor named Jerry Nims who had been working for 10 years on the problem of three-dimensional printing . Nims snowed Cianci with his ideas for a new kind of picture-taking . " I saw one more chance to be up at bat , one more chance to touch the magic , " Cianci recalled in an interview recently in Boston , shortly before jetting off to the Photokina exhibition in Cologne , West Germany . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decision to leave Polaroid and move his family to Atlanta . There he found others , from Honeywell , from Kodak and IBM , and , eventually , 15 people from Polaroid , including another marketing man , Robert Garrity . Three-dimensional photography is not new . Kodak had such a product as early as 1901 and some of us remember the novelty of using plastic glasses ( often made by Polaroid ) to watch horror films . The images seemed to leap out of the screen , reaching over the heads of the audience . It was frighteningly effective . And a bit silly ; no one expected to wear these glasses sitting on the living-room sofa leafing through the family album . Nimslo , a contraction of the names of the two founders , Jerry C. Nims and Allen K.W. Lo , was built on the loyalty of foreign investors like Fred Olson in Norway . Much of the venture capital has come from England , from insitutional types like Scottish Coal , Sun Alliance Co. ( insurance ) , Britania Fund , and Barring Brothers Pension Fund . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the slope on Mt . Everest , Nimslo did manage to raise $80 million before it had sold its first camera . When Cianci arrived at Nimslo there were 63 employees . Today there are more than 750 workers . Sales in 1981 were zero . Sales in 1982 have been estimated by analysts to be in the neighborhood of $40 million . Next year , sales from cameras , processing and accessories , according to Cianci , will reach $250 million . The Nimslo camera which sells for between $200 and $250 , carries four matched fixed-focus , f/5.6 30mm lenses , spaced half an inch apart across the front of the camera . The camera actually records four images of the subject , using half of a 35mm frame for each of the lenses . The system uses standard 35mm color negative film and processing runs about 95 cents a picture . The pictures , which are processed on an opaque plastic backing supplied by 3M , have a ridged surface , similar to the dime-store pictures that seemed to wave or wink when tilted . Nimslo pictures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wink " of those earlier prototypes , although Corbin says the company is working on reducing it . Nimslo will do all the film processing , in facilities in Atlanta and Connecticut . The strategy ensures control over the quality - and the lion ' s share of the processing revenues . Eventually there may be franchising of the processing , Cianci says , but not for the moment . In fact , the company is quite secretive about the way it produces the pictures . The company has a contract with Timex to produce 800,000 cameras during the next tow years . There are additional manufacturing facilities opening up momentarily in France which will be a launch site for taking the system throughout Europe . Nimslo is also , by the way , the largest single shareholder in Berkey photo , with 12 percent of the outstanding stock . These days , Cianci says the people at Nimslo look at every photograph that is processed and often send pictures back with comments enclosed , a touch of personal interest that will startle most consumers . The company has introduced its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ March , where the consumer response was strong , Nimslo then opened distribution lines in 19 states in the East and in 19 mid-western states . In a matter of days , Nimslo will launch a $20-million media blitz to advertise the camera with a television commercial that may itself cause something of a stir . The problem of advertising a three- dimensional photograph over a two-dimensional medium reportedly stumped many of Madison Avenue ' s best ad houses . But Ogilvy &; Mather took the problem to Hollywood , where they found Bob Abel of Walt Disney Productions , who worked on special effects for films like 2001 and Tron . His new technique for conveying a three-dimensional impression will air in commercials at the end of this week , during the Third Game of the World Series . A far cry from playing cards at a boys ' clubhouse in the North End .
