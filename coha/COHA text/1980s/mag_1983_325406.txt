There were more than enough rumors and full-blown theories last week to tantalize those who were curious about President Francois Mitterrand 's motive in expelling Soviet officials from France . Perhaps the most intriguing hypothesis centered on the unsolved murder of a top French intelligence officer two months ago . One morning last <P> February , three maintenance workers clearing snow from a winding country road 40 miles north of Nice came upon an empty Peugeot . The door on the driver 's side had been left open , and the radio was blaring . The work team soon discovered why . Sprawled in front of the car was the body of a man , dusted with snow . A frozen pool of blood had formed under a gaping gunshot wound in his head . <P> Police found a military ID card identifying the dead man as Lieut . Colonel Bernard Nut , 47 , the chief of the Direction Generate de la Securite Exterieure , the French equivalent of the CIA , for all of southeastern France . But investigators came across precious few other clues to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .357 Magnum revolver was found 15 ft. from his body , ruling out the possibility of suicide . And even though three shots had been fired from the gun , no bullet was found in Nut 's body . An autopsy revealed that he had eaten a hearty meal at least three hours before his death , but a search of local restaurants and cafes turned up no clues of his whereabouts on the night of the murder . <P> To complicate the investigation further , police noticed that the gas tank in Nut 's rented car was empty . Days before the murder , the brakes in Nut 's own car had worn through under mysterious circumstances . If he had been set up , the rented car might have also been fixed so that Nut would have been left stranded on the deserted road at the mercy of a killer masquerading as a helpful passerby . It was equally possible that Nut might have left the motor running while he jumped out of his car to make a quick , and fatal , rendezvous . <P> None of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rumored to have been carrying on a stormy affair with a Lebanese woman and might have been the victim of a crime of passion . But given his intelligence connections , it seemed more likely that he was the target of a foreign operative , perhaps even a double agent . <P> Though Nut ostensibly kept watch on vital French nuclear installations in his region , he is known to have been running a team of undercover agents and informants , providing information on Soviet intelligence activities in France . He made several trips to Italy , which prompted speculation that he might have been investigating Bulgarian links in the plot to kill Pope John Paul II . Nut could also have played a role in uncovering Soviet Agent Victor Pronin , who was arrested in Rome the day before the French intelligence officer was murdered . Italian Under Secretary of Defense Bartolo Ciccardini seemed convinced that Nut 's death played a role in last week 's mass expulsion . Said he : " This assassination triggered a war between the French and Soviet secret services . The French could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "
