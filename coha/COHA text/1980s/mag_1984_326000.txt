A report says the nominee for Attorney General broke no laws <P> After Washington Attorney Jacob Stein took on the court-appointed task last April of investigating Presidential Counsellor Edwin Meese 's tangled personal finances , Democrats promptly asked him to assess Meese 's fitness to serve as Attorney General . Meese 's lawyers , on the other hand , urged Stein to declare that " the evidence does not substantiate the loose charges of moral turpitude against Mr. Meese . " Stein refused to take either course . In a 385-page report , which was made public last week , Stein concluded that he found no evidence that would support any criminal charges against the President 's choice to become the nation 's highest law-enforcement officer . <P> At a White House briefing , Meese happily embraced the Stein report . He said it confirmed that he and his wife " have never taken advantage of an official position to obtain private gain . " His ordeal , Meese said , had taught him " the need for constant vigilance and sensitivity , not only to actual conduct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President Reagan said that if reelected , he would resubmit the Meese nomination when the new Senate meets in January . <P> Stein , a prominent defense lawyer , had considered eleven allegations against Meese . Many of them involved his acceptance of personal financial favors from people who later acquired federal jobs . Repeatedly , Stein concluded that there was no evidence showing a direct connection between the generosity to Meese and the appointments . In most cases , those who acquired the Government posts , Stein noted , were supporters of the President who may have gained their positions without any help from Meese . <P> Meese clearly did select Edwin W. Thomas as an aide to his White House office after Thomas had offered Meese 's wife an interest-free $15,000 loan . The loan was later granted , but Meese failed to report it on his financial-disclosure statements . Stein concluded that Thomas got the job because of his longstanding personal and professional relationship with Meese , rather than as a result of any transaction . While " an inference of willful nondisclosure arguably could be drawn , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Meese to conceal the loan and therefore he accepted Meese 's claim that the omission was " inadvertent . " Still , the report does show that Thomas told Stein that he had reminded Meese of the loan shortly before Meese filed his disclosure form . <P> Although Meese failed to make mortgage payments for 15 months on his California house and on a home he purchased in Virginia in 1981 , Stein called the circumstances " not unusual for ' preferred ' customers " of a bank . Four officers of the Great American Federal Savings Bank of San Diego , which made the loans , got federal jobs with Meese 's help , Stein found , but might have done so without his aid .
