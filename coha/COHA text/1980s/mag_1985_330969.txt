Irving Kristol , often described as the godfather of neoconservatism , came up with the notion about three years ago . The Public Interest ( circ. 12,000 ) , the neocon-servative quarterly devoted to domestic issues that he helped found 20 years ago , had shown that it could attract an in-tensely loyal audience . So why not start a similar journal on foreign policy ? This week Kristol will test that idea when the National Interest hits the newsstands . The new quarterly , says Kristol , will provide a forum where conservatives " can argue with one another . " <P> According to an editors ' note in the premier issue , the National Interest makes three assumptions : the primary purpose of U.S. foreign policy must be to defend the national interests of the U.S. ; international politics remains power politics ; and the Soviet Union represents the single greatest threat to America 's interests . Two decades ago , the journal 's editors contend , those statements were considered truisms , but today they have become almost exclusively conservative beliefs . <P> Articles in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paralyzing effect Congress has on the President 's ability to forge foreign policy . Jeane Kirkpatrick , who serves on the journal 's advisory board , contributes a speech arguing the morality of U.S. aid to anti-Communist rebels . In an essay , Kristol says that support is growing in the U.S. for a muscular foreign policy grounded in the belief that the conflict between the U.S. and the Soviet Union is not one of clashing national interests , as some liberals say , but of ideologies . Kristol predicts that the U.S. will be quicker to use its military power in the years ahead if there is a commitment to victory . " That there should be ' no more Vietnams ' . . . is something American opinion is unanimous about , " writes Kristol . " But no one . . . is now declaiming ' No more Grenadas . ' " <P> The magazine , co-edited by Robert Tucker and Owen Harries , has a press run of 5,000 . But Executive Editor Tod Lindberg predicts circulation will reach 12,000 within two years . The nonprofit magazine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Olin Foundation , which contributed $600,000 . Kristol is already optimistic enough about the journal 's potential influence to label it part of a new " trinity , " along with Foreign Affairs ( circ. 90,000 ) and Foreign Policy ( 25,000 ) .
