In recent years , the makers of home photography equipment have had few triumphs to put in their picture albums . Sales of once promising products like disk-film cameras have been lackluster , and videotape recorders have become strong competitors for the consumer dollar . Against this dim background , Minolta has been a bright performer . The Japanese firm 's Maxxum , which focuses automatically and sells for about $350 with a basic lens , has turned Minolta ( est. fiscal-1985 sales : $975 million ) into the No. 1 producer of 35- mm single-lens reflex ( reflected-image ) cameras , which account for a third of the worldwide camera market . " This is one of those epochmaking products that come out once in a decade , " says Motohiko Kimura , director of research and information for the Japan Camera Industry Association . <P> Consumers have long been able to buy inexpensive point-and-shoot cameras , but the Maxxum was the first fully automated single-lens reflex product to enable people to take high-quality 35-mm pictures with high-technology ease . Now the year-old Maxxum is attracting rivals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $940 million ) , the maker of Nikon , became the first firm to announce a comparable alternative to Minolta 's pioneering model . Like the Maxxum , the Nikon N2020 will use two microchips and a tiny motor inside the camera to focus automatically . The camera , which will be priced at about $460 for the body alone when it arrives in U.S. stores in April , will include an optional converter to make it compatible with the company 's existing line of 35-mm lenses , some 15 million of which have been sold . The Maxxum , by contrast , requires a special set of lenses . <P> Minolta seemed unperturbed by the Nikon announcement . Said Minolta President Hideo Tashima : " Nikon 's move is welcomed , although we expect the competition will intensify . The pie will grow bigger if everyone takes part . " The field in fact may soon grow crowded . Canon , Japan 's largest camera maker , is expected to introduce a similar 35-mm model later this year . Experts say Olympus and Ricoh are readying their own versions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " They have a lot of momentum , " says Eugene Glazer , a photo-industry specialist for the Dean % Witter Reynolds investment firm . Spurred by the Maxxum , Minolta 's profits jumped almost 60% in the first half of fiscal 1985 , to $28.5 million . The price of Minolta shares , which are traded on the Tokyo Stock Exchange , has increased about 60% since January 1985 . Minolta closed last week at $4.82 a share . <P> The Maxxum appeals to a wide range of picture takers , from bird watchers to parents who do not want to miss Junior 's first step as they try to focus the camera . Whatever the attraction , many dealers have had to struggle to meet the demand . " We ca n't keep enough Maxxums in stock , " says Michael Schreiber , a salesman for Bel Air Camera in Los Angeles .
