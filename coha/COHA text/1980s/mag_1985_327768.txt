Only seven days earlier , West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl had endured the strain of President Reagan 's controversial visit to a military cemetery at Bitburg with its Nazi graves . Last week the Chancellor faced an ordeal that was , in terms of his political future , more significant . In the most important state election since Kohl 's national victory two years ago , voters went to the polls in North Rhine-Westphalia , whose 17 million residents represent more than a quarter of the country 's electorate . The result : a stinging setback for the Chancellor . <P> In the race for the state parliament , Kohl 's conservative Christian Democratic Union made its poorest showing in 35 years , garnering just 36.5% of the vote . By contrast , the left-of-center Social Democratic Party posted its best performance ever , winning a majority of 52.1% . Every major city in the state except the federal capital of Bonn fell to the Social Democrats , as did more than half the districts formerly held by the Christian Democrats . Kohl called the results a " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost large numbers from two of its most faithful constituencies : farmers and the elderly . <P> There were , here and there , a few consolations for the Chancellor . One of his coalition partners , the Free Democratic Party , which only three months ago seemed in danger of becoming extinct , continued its comeback by winning 6% of the votes . The anti-Establishment Greens , meanwhile , dropped to only 4.6% , just short of the 5% minimum required to gain a seat in the state parliament . <P> Nonetheless the results , coming only two months after the Christian Democrats lost control of the industrial state of Saarland for the first time in 30 years , suggested that Kohl 's re-election in 1987 is by no means certain . " In only two years , the party has lost 1.7 million voters , " said Kurt Biedenkopf , the Christian Democrats ' co-chairman in North Rhine-Westphalia . <P> Although the Chancellor campaigned actively throughout the state , his personal popularity apparently wrought no magic . Reagan 's Bitburg visit probably did not harm the Chancellor 's cause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kohl had hoped . The defeat also betrayed a widespread impatience that the Chancellor 's long-promised economic Wende , or turnaround , has not fully materialized ; indeed , in February , national unemployment soared to a postwar high of 10.6% . To make matters worse , Kohl 's protege , Bernhard Worms , was trounced in the race for North Rhine-Westphalia state leader by Incumbent Johannes Rau . With his moderate views and good-natured disposition , Rau may eventually displace the lackluster Hans-Jochen Vogel as the Social Democrats ' parliamentary leader and mount a formidable challenge for the chancellorship . <P> On an election-night television show last week , both of the main parties went on the attack . Kohl and Social Democratic Party Leader Willy Brandt , a former Chancellor , broke into a shouting match , with Kohl accusing Brandt of " primitive anti-Americanism " and Brandt calling Kohl " a liar . " In the days that followed , the Bundestag crackled with heckling and mudslinging . " This , " said Social Democratic Secretary-General Peter Glotz , " is the beginning of the central campaign . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
