 | THE CRIME SCENE ? a field in western Kentucky ? looked for all the world as if a lowflying squadron of bombers had just swooped over on a practice run . More than 450 small craters , each edged by a mound of raw earth , pocked the surface of the unplanted field . But no air raid caused this destruction . It was the work of ... but how to refer to them ? Some call them relic collectors , pothunters , treasure seekers , even " para-archaeologists . " Others , less forgiving , castigate them as looters , desecrators , even commercial grave robbers . By whatever designation ? and for whatever motives ? the ten men who dug into this field in late 1987 disturbed more than bones and Indian relics . They ripped out and crumpled an irreplaceable page of our common heritage ? and raised in high relief the growing controversy over the looting , sale , and exhibition of Native American remains and grave goods . The incident has prodded the nation to ask itself the emotionally charged question : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retired detective sergeant of the Kentucky State Police , recalls : " We got a report that some relic hunters were looting an old Indian burial ground on a farm in Union County . Headquarters sent me out to check , since any discovery of human remains has to be filed with the state . " Now , surface collecting is a popular hobby in this area . A lot of folks have relics or arrowheads . People dig ' em up in their gardens and plow ' em up in their fields . Twenty years ago @# I used to pick up arrowheads myself ? with permission ? out of that same field . Before Mrs. Slack died and the farm was sold , she talked to me about the history of the property . I 'm still interested in Indian culture , but now I carve copies of peace pipes instead of looking for real ones . " When Sergeant Hart drove out to investigate , two men came to talk with him at the farm gate but refused to let him on the site . Returning with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been rigged with a hose for softening the droughtparched earth . Countless small probe holes punctured the brown topsoil of the 40 acres overlooking the Ohio River near Uniontown , Kentucky . " The men had told me there were n't any human bones ; it was a prehistoric campsite , not a burial ground ; they had rights to dig , and I had no business there since it was private land . But looking at all those craters , well ... I knew amateurs do n't destroy whole sites like that . These people were literally mining the place . It had every sign of a commercial operation . " Sergeant Hart did find bones ? clearly human ? strewn among the craters . " There were jawbones , leg bones , finger bones , human teeth everywhere . We got a cease and desist order until we could figure out which laws had been broken . " The men had paid the landowner $10,000 to lease digging rights between the fall harvest and spring planting . The ten were charged by the state of Kentucky with " desecration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crimes ranging from  | toppling tombstones on Halloween to Ku Klux Klan cross burnings ? a misdemeanor that was punishable by a maximum fine of $500 and as much as a year in jail . Four of the ten men , however , lived in Illinois or Indiana and could n't be extradited for a misdemeanor . Spurred by the event , the Kentucky Legislature in March 1988 unanimously revised the law , making desecration of graves a felony ? which would allow extradition in future cases . Another bill narrowly missed passage in Indiana ? where grave looters can be prosecuted only for trespassing , a misdemeanor carrying a fine as low as one dollar . But supporters of the bill promise to push for a stronger law this year . AS OF THIS WRITING the criminal trial of the " Slack Farm Ten " has been delayed . A parallel civil suit filed by the state ( seeking return of artifacts taken from the site , costs of documenting the looting , and punitive damages for the destruction of an archaeological resource ) was dismissed in August because Kentucky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Supreme Court may have to resolve the issue of the state 's power to regulate archaeological excavations versus landowner 's rights ( a cherished Kentucky principle says a property owners rights go " from heaven to hell " " If the diggers are found guilty in the criminal case , " points out David Wolf , forensic anthropologist of the Kentucky medical examiner 's office , " the provisions of ARPA ( the federal Archaeological Resources Protection Act of 1979 ) , which only apply on private property if  | local law has been violated , would kick in . Then the FBI could go in and seize artifacts that had been illegally taken across state lines . " Because of the scale of the Slack Farm operation and the diggers ' brazen disregard for human sensibilities , we 're hoping this case will spur a national burial preservation act , " concludes Dr. Wolf . Pleading not guilty , the ten defendants are backed by an influential lobby of relic collectors who see a cherished hobby ( and profitable business ) threatened by proposed laws and new legal precedents . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Kentucky , argues in their defense : " These guys are being made the scapegoats for what others have done for years . If it were n't for collectors , a lot of this stuff would be totally lost ? plowed into pieces by farmers , washed away by floods , paved over for parking lots and housing projects . We collectors see ourselves as saving history , not destroying it . " Cheryl Ann Munson , senior archaeologist at Indiana University 's Glenn A. Black Laboratory of Archaeology , counters : " It 's one thing for a collector to pick up points in a field ; it is entirely different to dig into archaeological sites to mine artifacts for money . The really sad thing is that we 'll never know what 's been taken or how it relates to what remains in the ground . Everything has been scrambled . This field is one of the prime Mississippian sites of the Ohio River Valley from the time of European contact . Now much of what we could have known is lost forever . " In February archaeologists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ examiner 's office to determine how many of the burials had been disturbed ( at least 650 , probably 383  | more ) , began mapping the site . " We had hundreds of volunteers to help with the effort , " said archaeologist David Pollack of the Kentucky Heritage Council , which coordinated the operation . " They were local students , businessmen , retired folk ? everyone outraged by what they saw . " After all the publicity some people who had dug up bones in the past turned them in to the medical examiner 's office . There was even talk of turning the Slack Farm site into a park . WHAT DO archaeologists know of this Slack Farm site ? As far back as 1858 , amateur archaeologist Sidney S. Lyon of nearby Jeffersonville , Indiana , donated some Indian relics he had dug up around there to the Smithsonian Institution . A decade later , Lyon ? this time officially sponsored by the Smithsonian ? conducted a more thorough survey , noting : " There is a great field for investigation on both sides of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The people of the country have little or no exact information as to the number or location of the mounds . When a field is cleared inclosing a mound , and bones are ploughed up , the fact becomes known , but the existence of mounds in the woods or on the ridges is almost unknown ; and as they are undoubtedly very numerous an explorer would find work enough to do . " Among the five mound groups mapped by Lyon was a concentration of more than 40 mounds at Slack Farm . Some he dug as best he could ? with the rudimentary archaeological techniques of the time ? and dutifully sent findings to the Smithsonian Institution . His report on this material helped provide clues on the dating and 385  | nature of ancient human occupation here ? and possibly led the looters of 1987 to the site . " This was no temporary camp without burials , as the looters claimed , " notes Cheryl Ann Munson , one of the archaeologists directing last spring 's investigation . " It was a major village that flourished from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the CabornWelborn phase of the late Mississippian period ? an important protohistoric era spanning the time of first contact with Europeans . Pre-Mississippian settlements here include a much older Woodland phase ? we call it Crab Orchard ? that dates back to about the time of Christ . " At the height of the Mississippian period ( A. D. 900 to 1400 ) towns and villages , with flattopped mounds serving as foundations for nobles ' dwellings or temples , covered much of eastern North America . Archaeologists characterize the culture of the Mississippian people as one based on the cultivation of corn . Hence the location in rich river bottomlands of its greatest settlements : Cahokia Mounds in Illinois , near East St. Louis ; Angel Mounds , near Evansville , Indiana , just 22 miles upriver from Slack Farm ; and Moundville , near Tuscaloosa , Alabama . The Slack Farm site likely drew importance from the confluence of two great rivers ? the Ohio and the Wabash . In the late Mississippian , say A.D. 1500 , it would have presented a scene of closely packed rectangular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handle the midwestern rains ; extensive cornfields on alluvial bottomlands ; and perhaps 300 to 500 people . When they died , they were buried in cemeteries near their houses and granaries , with grave goods perhaps to assist them in the spirit world . By drawing on data from oth , contemporary sites as well as analogies from the ways of the Choctaw , Creek , Shawnee , and other historical tribes , one can visualize many vignettes of Mississippian life : Men in river clearings burning great logs felled with stone axes , then hollowing them with adzes to make dugout canoes ; others along the shore fishing with weighted nets ; small hunting groups in the forested higher terrain away from the river , hunting whitetailed deer ; children shaping play pots while their mothers built real ones ; dogs yapping and cavorting ; men and women making flint tools , weaving , repairing houses , carving stone pipes . And pervading the ancient settlement at Slack Farm as thoroughly as the acrid woodsmoke from the cooking fires , a deeply rooted belief system links the visible world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the person of Native American activists who arrived on the scene in Union County after they heard about the Slack Farm looting . Outraged at the desecra tion , they visited the site with Kentucky authorities and later claimed the skeletal remains under a " friend of the deceased " provision of state law . Their claim was recognized by David Wolf of the state medical examiner 's office ? who played a crucial role in bringing the criminal case to prosecution . He agreed to give the Indian activists the bones for ceremonial reburial after criminal evidence had been gathered and the scientific analysis had been completed . Among the factions of the @# @#  | loosely organized Indian contingent were several Shawnee from Oklahoma , who were convinced their direct ancestors had lived in this area before being driven out in the early 1800s . Others were Cherokee , Sioux , Ojibwa , Apache , even Alaska Athapaskan . Faced with the Shawnee 's contention that the Slack Farm site had been a Shawnee village , the archaeologists contacted tribal officials of the Shawnee in Oklahoma and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goods . " I do not believe that the modern Shawnee descended from the people buried here , " says Cheryl Ann Munson . " Only with an extensive excavation and full-fledged study of the remains can we learn more and answer the descent question . " But Native American activists counter that the archaeologists simply do n't want to deal with modern Indians who might interfere with their work and make claims to the grave contents ? and to many museum collections , as well . Experts agree that the Shawnee once lived in this region . Shawneetown , Illinois , is only ten miles from Slack Farm , and this whole tri-state area ? where Kentucky , Indiana , and Illinois converge ? is rich in Shawnee associations . Some historians place the Shawnee farther up the Ohio River during the 1500s and 1600s , arguing that they only passed through here in the late 1700s before they were driven across the Mississippi . The authoritative Archaeology of the Lower Ohio River Valley ( 1986 ) , by Jon Muller of Southern Illinois University , outlines a case for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Caborn-Welborn people . And according to Dr. Helen Tanner , research associate at the Newberry Library in Chicago : 388 " There are only so many tribes who might be identified with the Caborn-Welborn culture , and the Shawnee , in my opinion , are the most likely . It seems to me that many archaeo : - ogists have developed a block in tying together historic tribes and prehistoric cultures ; in reality it is all one continuum . " Says Dennis Banks , longtime American Indian Movement leader who came to Union County to lead the Indian contingent : " The archaeologists say nobody knows who the descendants of these people are . They say you ca n't tell if they were Shawnee because they 're ' prehistoric . ' That 's their word for prewhite . ' It seems they 're saying we Indians ca n't have any ancestors at all . So that gives them the right to dig them up . If you ask me , they 're hardly any better than grave robbers themselves ; only difference is they 've got a state permit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , Shawnee or not , we are all laying claim to these ancestors . " What if this were a white cemetery that had been desecrated ? Would the archaeologists be bagging the disturbed bones and grave goods to take them for study at museums and universities ? " We 're not here for a confrontation . We just want to see that the Ancient Ones get a proper reburial . Those who dug up their bones just do n't understand the forces they 've let loose . " The Indians set up a tepee and organized a vigil near the site , held tobacco-burning ceremonies every four days , and built a sweat lodge to purify those who came to visit the disturbed graves . A poignant public Ancestors Day ceremony was celebrated over Memorial Day weekend ? possibly to become an annual event . Two weeks earlier the  | first of three consignments of bones was reburied ? without fanfare ? by Chiefs Leon Shenandoah and Vincent Johnson of the Six Nations Iroquois Confederacy. * A large cloud , sliding providentially across the otherwise clear sky , gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put the cardboard boxes containing the remains of 114 Ancient Ones into holes the archaeologists had left for that purpose . In his native Onondaga language , he intoned a series of prayers . Later he explained : " I was talking to the disturbed spirits . They ca n't rest until their bones are completely dust . I asked them not to harm us . I told them we are putting them back so they can start their journey to the otherworld again . And I prayed that they would forget all this ever happened and not take vengeance on those who dug them up . " At the end of the prayers the dirt that the original diggers had tossed aside so carelessly and that the archaeologists had so meticulously sifted was shoveled back to cover the boxes in their new common grave , well beneath the plow zone . Smoothing the mound , Chief Shenandoah set a lighted lantern beside it . " To light their way to eternity , " he said . IN OWENSBORO , Kentucky , tables groaning under the weight of tens of thousands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by chandeliers . Billed as " The Indian Relic Show of Relic Shows , " this annual event is enough to give terminal depression to anyone who knew the childhood miracle of finding an arrowpoint in the backyard . Box after box is filled with points ? you can get the commonest arrowheads for 50 cents to a few dollars ; a finely preserved Paleo-Indian spearpoint brings $500 or more . A glass case displays exquisite bannerstones ? the stone weights used with atlatls , the spear-thrower common before the bow and arrow came into vogue some 1,200 years ago . At one table a couple examine a shell pendant , a gorget dangling from a necklace of fine shell beads : $1,200 . " It 's got the weeping-eye motif of the Southern Cult , " urges the seller . While most pieces bear no label other than price , some have little museum-style ID tags : " Yankeetown , A. D. 1200 " ... " Hopewell , 200 B.C.-A.D. 200 . " " You wo n't find much of the really good stuff out in the open , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You got ta be serious before they 'll show it to you . And watch out for fakes . Even the experts get fooled . " " Did you dig this piece yourself ? " you ask the dealers . Most shake their heads . " Naw , got it at an estate sale . " ... " Bought it from a guy . " " Where 's it from ? " you ask . " Well , this guy said he got it down in Georgia . " Or Oklahoma . Or bought it from an old lady in Ohio . Get too specific with your questions , and you get a peeved stare . It 's like asking people details of their taxes . " Anything from Slack Farm here ? " That one brings either a blank look or a guffaw . Everyone at the show knows about the recent hoopla . Many items might be from the site ? but there 's not a whit of legal proof that any of them are . Photographer Steve Wall managed to track down one piece allegedly from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : a four-inch carved limestone pipe ( page 385 ) . The collector knows of only two others , one also said to be from the farm and the other from a few miles away . The man who claimed he 'd bought it ? for $4,500 ? said he had confirmation of its origin from the seller . Other rare pieces have gone for hundreds of thousands of dollars . Most diggers , though , would tell you they 're lucky to make the equivalent of minimum wage for their hours of shoveling in the hot sun . " For the vast majority it 's the sport and adventure of it , not the financial gain , " says Art Gerber , whose show is one of scores held throughout the country each year . Yet some dealers ? including Gerber himself ? have collections in their vaults that would make a museum curator cry with frustration . Most of these pieces are what archaeologists call " without provenance " ? no record of the physical context from which they were dug . Hence , they are nearly useless for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the puzzle of our common past , never to be fitted . WATCH OUT for copperheads ! " warned Ed Hastings as he led the way up the hillock behind Slack Farm . Ed has been roaming these bluffs and terraces above the lower Ohio for more than half a century . He was a " surface hunter , " making his finds on the ground , not under it . In recent years he 's given up even that , becoming purely a mapper of Indian cemeteries and sites . " I 've recorded more than 250 sites , some larger , some smaller than this one , all within a hundred miles of here . I guess there must be twice that many . Every so often someone will come across an old Paleo-Indian point out here dropped by a hunter maybe 10,000 years ago . Some of these ancient settlements are layered like wedding cakes , going down maybe a dozen feet . " When those diggers dug here , they mixed up all the layers and tossed the bones around like so much sewer pipe . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few bones , too , in my time . Once I found the whole skeleton of a mastodon . But whenever I found human bones , I reburied them with a prayer . Maybe it 's because I 've got a drop of Apache blood . That was the only time I dug ? to put ' em back . " The diggers say they were n't digging for bones , just pots . But look at all those probe holes among the craters ? thousands of ' em . You do n't make those looking for pots at random . You 'd never find much that way . You make all those probes because you 're looking for the soft feel of bones . If you find bones , chances are you 're going to find grave goods too . That 's where the money is . The only bones they usually take are the whole skulls ? people buy ' em as candle holders . " But I do n't see these guys as monsters , like some people do , " Hastings continued . " I know the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came to realize it was wrong to take this stuff for yourself . This is everybody 's history , not just yours or mine . It should n't be for personal profit . I 'm not tellin ' others to stop surface huntin ' or collectin ' . But I do say this : " Do n't dig ? you destroy history when you do . And do n't buy the stuff either . If everybody stopped buyin ' , these guys would do a lot less destruction . Me , I still hunt for sites but only with my eyes . Those bones down there ? they 're everyone 's ancestors . I say let ' em rest in peace ! "
