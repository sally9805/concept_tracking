MASSE By Leigh Allison Wilson he truth is it 's not much of a city . When I moved in two years ago , all I knew about it was from a Chamber of Commerce brochure I got free at the courthouse : WELCOME , it said , TO THE BIG CITY IN THE LITTLE VALLEY BY THE LAKE , I had six suitcases in the back of my car and $350 and a good reason for leaving the place I 'd left . For a woman like me , that 's all people need to know . You start explaining things too much , you start giving heartfelt reasons for this and for that , and then nothing becomes clear and people do n't trust you and you start looking at your life from bad angles . I like things clear . But the truth is it 's not much of a city , not much of a valley , and you have to drive five miles to get to the lake . These are simple facts . In the brochure they said the population was twenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seventeen . One problem is that most of the Chamber of Commerce live outside town , in big houses on the lake , and so maybe they do n't come into the city much , to get the accurate head count . One thing I 'm good at is counting . On Sunday nights at the local P &; C , the average customer head count is twenty-six : on weekdays it is fifty-four after five o'clock . I can tell you the price of leaded gas at ten different stations , the price of unleaded at seven of them . Anytime you get good at something , it 's because of a habit ; counting things is just a habit with me . Last week I counted twelve geese heading for Canada in two perfect lines , a perfect V , and twelve is enough to prove that spring is coming . You can sometimes live a good life figuring angles and counting things , if you 're in the habit of it . What I 've done for the last two years is , I drive a UPS truck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have had some trouble lately , but not Leigh Allison Wilson is the author of From the Bottom Up , a collection of stories . because of the UPS or the pool . You might think that these are things that women do n't do  --  drive trucks for a living , that is , and play pool  --  but I do them , and so you probably just do n't know enough women . Take into account enough numbers , anything is possible . Phineas says that the opposite is true , that given enough numbers nothing is possible , but he is a bartender who does n't like crowds . Very little he says makes any sense . I 've been seeing him off and on for the past six months , mostly off . 1 met him , as I said , about six months ago , when all the trouble started . It was November , but a clear day , and the wind was gusting to forty miles per hour . I know because I listen to the radio in my truck . Every street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like a parade , from all the wind . This is what you could call an economically depressed town , which means that everybody in it is depressed about money , so I remember that November day 's weather in particular . It was the only time I have ever seen anything like a celebration on the streets , all those hats in the air and everybody running after them , their faces as red and distorted as any winning crowd on television . I do not own a television , but all the bars have them . There are thirty-three bars in this city , and only nine have regulation pool tables . This is just a fact of life . That day I was behind in my deliveries , although mostly I am punctual to a fault . I have a map of the city inlaid like a tattoo in my mind  --  where the easy right-hand turns are , where the short lights are , where the children play in the streets and thus become obstacles . I had to memorize the map in the Chamber of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell you that maps like that are useless to a good driver . Maps are flat , cities are not . Obstacles are everywhere , but the good driver knows where they are and how to avoid them . Picture STORY 47 the city as a big pool table , right after the break in eight ball . Your opponent 's balls surround you , like seven stop signs all over the table . You must deliver the goods in a timely fashion . Knowing the correct angles is everything . The simple truth is I know all the angles in this town . But that day I was behind in my deliveries and Danny , the dispatcher , kept coming over the radio , kidding around . " You 're late , you 're late , " he said . " Frankly , I 'm appalled . Frankly , your ass is in a slingshot . " He was in his silly-serious mood . jazzing around with the radio , bored to death with his job . He used to be a big shot on some high school football team @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and although he is still a huge , bruised-looking man , the only big shots in his life now come from bars . He drinks too much is my meaning , but in a town like this that goes without saying . " It 's the wind , " I told him , clicking the mike . few straightforward things about the game . He handled the cue stick the way lips handle a toothpick , all muscle and no control , then he tried a crazy masse shot that was all wrong for the situation and ended up tearing the felt of the table . Finesse and control are the names of the game in pool , but he would have none of it . They kicked him out of the bar . I ran the table twelve straight games after he left and picked up about seventy dollars  --  a very good night for me . I made my last delivery at about four o'clock , the wind buffeting the truck every yard of the way . Usually I am punctual , but the fact is the elements are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wind was a factor . For another thing , there is always the customer factor . If your customer is in a hurry , he just grabs a pen or pencil and lets it rip ; you get an unclear address and end up wasting precious minutes . My advice " It 's the wind and about fifty zillion hats . I 'm not kidding , there 's exactly a hundred fifty hats out here today . " " Ignore ' em , " he said . " Run ' ern down , " he said . His voice came out high and crackly , as though any minute he might burst into weird , witchlike laughter . Radios do this to everybody 's voice . " What 's the matter with you ? " 1 asked , but I could tell that he 'd already signed off , was already kidding around with another truck , his big body hunched over the radio back at the office , surrounded by boxes and handcarts and no windows anywhere . Danny 's life is highly unclear . Once I tried to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use a typewriter . That way there is nothing personal to get in the way of the timely execution of your business . Chaos is no man 's friend , clarity is everything . I parked the truck in the lot at four-thirty , tied up some loose ends inside the office , then went outside to my car . It is a ' 73 navy Impala with a lot of true grit . Most people picture a good car and they think of bright color or sleek line or some other spiffy feature . This is all wrong . The best part of a good car , what makes it a good car , is its guts : pistons that never miss a beat ; a carburetor so finely tuned it is like a genius chemist , mixing air and gasoline as if from beakers ; a transmission that works smoothly , the shield , I could see Mrs. McDaniels , my landlady , leaning over the second-floor railing of my apartment building , her eyes magnified by bifocals and staring straight down , it seemed , onto my knuckles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back at her . She is a businesslady , never misses a trick ; she calls all of us tenants her " clientele , " just as if she were the madam of a whorehouse . The apartment building looks like one of those ten-dollar-a-night motels  --  two stories with lines of doors opening onto a common walkway that has a wrought-iron railing down the length of it . But Mrs. McDaniels runs a tight ship , no monkey business . " Have you tried goldfish ? " she called down when I got out of the car . " My sister says she has goldfish you could n't kill with a hammer . " " I think so , I do n't know , " I called back . My hands were shaking so much I had to put them in the trouser pockets of my uniform , fisting them up in there . When I got up to the second floor , I began it again , this time with Mrs. McDaniels I figured I 'd have to put a lot of left English on my body in order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , into the doorway of my apartment . I brought out a fist with my keys in it . " You 're late , " she said , her eyes large and shrewd as a bear 's . " Are you drunk or what ? " I quit listing sideways , then jiggled the keys . " No , " I told her . " Just a dizzy spell . It 's from sitting down all day . All the blood goes to my butt or something . " " Goldfish , " she said , sniffing the air around me until , apparently satisfied , she moved to the side so I could get to my door . " Well ? " she asked , and she asked it again , " Well ? " For a moment I thought Mrs. McDaniels wanted to shake my hand , then I noticed the Baggie of water between her fingers . In it two goldfish held themselves as rigid and motionless as dead things . And they might as well have been , because I knew right then that they were doomed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , opening the door with one arm so that she could go inside ahead of me . " I think I tried goldfish first thing . " Once inside the room Mrs. McDaniels began to war with herself . She prides herself on being someone who is easygoing and friendly with her tenants , but when she gets inside your apartment , she ca n't help herself . Those eyes behind the glasses glaze over with suspicion , search for holes in the plaster , gashes in the parquet . My apartment is one large room , with a kitchenette and a bathroom off it , a couch , a card table , three chairs , a bed , a dresser , and a fish tank . She went directly over to the couch , studying my new poster of Minnesota Fats . " You 're fixing the place up , " she said suspiciously . " I used the special glue , Mrs. McDaniels . It does n't peel the paint . " " Oh ! " she cried . " I do n't mind at all , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that good humor and business were tearing Mrs. McDaniels apart , but finally business won our and she pulled a top corner of the poster away from the wall . It came away cleanly , just as the advertisement for the glue had predicted , though after that the corner bent over and did n't stay stuck anymore . " Silly me , " she cried gaily . She was in high spirits now . " I really like that poster . " For a year and a half I had lived in the apartment without anything on the walls . Every time Mrs. McDaniels came inside , she 'd say , " You live like a transient , just like a transient . " And I always said , " I like things neat . " And I did . But this Minnesota Fats poster caught my eye . In it Fats is crouched over the cue ball , looking into the side pocket , which is where the camera is . You do n't see the side pocket , you just see Fats looking squint-eyed at you , looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or two . And he does . The poster cost me two-fifty but was worth every penny . " I think I tried goldfish about a year ago , " I told her . " They did n't last . " " You never know , " she said . " I think these guys are winners . " She held up the Baggie and studied the fish for flaws . I did not bother to look at them ; I knew . They were already as good as dead . When I first moved in , the fish tank was the only piece of furniture in the room , if you can call a fish tank furniture . The tenant before me had skipped out on his rent but had left the tank as a kind of palliative gesture . Inside there was even a fish , still alive , roaming from one end of the tank to the other . It was rat-colored , about three inches long , with yellow freckles all over its sides  --  an ugly , sour-looking fish . I called it The Rockfish . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maybe it was lonely , maybe loneliness had made it go ugly and sour , and so I went down to the pet store for some companions to put into the tank . The guy there gave me two angelfish  --  two pert , brightly colored fish that he said got along famously with each other and with just about anybody else . I put them in with The Rockfish and waited for something to happen . The next day I thought to look in the tank , but there was no sign of the angelfish , not a trace , just The Rockfish patrolling all the corners . After that I tried every kind of fish in the pet store  --  guppies , gobies , glassfish , neons , swordtails , even a catfish bigger than The Rockfish . They all just vanished , as if the tank had pockets . Mrs. McDaniels became obsessed when I told her about it . From then on nothing would do but that we find a fish good enough to go the distance in the tank . We did n't know whether The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of neuter , but we tried everything again : he s , shes , its , they all disappeared . Soon I wished I had never told Mrs. McDaniels anything about it , because I could tell she was beginning to associate me with the fish . She started dropping hints about what a man could do for a woman around the house , about how a woman like me could use a good man to straighten out her life . I just told her l already had all the angles figured , thank you , and that a good man was n't hard to find if you were looking for one , which I was n't . " Listen , " said Mrs. McDaniels , shaking the Baggie . " My sister says these guys do n't know the meaning of death . They 're right from her own tank . She should know . " " She should , " I said , " but frankly , Mrs. McDaniels , I think they 're dead meat . " " When are you settling down ? " she asked absently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glass in front of The Rockfish , her glasses pressed right up against it . I wondered then , because it seemed strange , whether Mrs. ivIcDaniels 's eyes , magnified by the glasses and the glass of the tank , whether her eyes might look huge as billiard balls to The Rockfish . No mistake , it had to be a strange sight from that angle . " Here 's hoping , " she said . Then she dumped the goldfish in . They floated for a few seconds , eye to eye with The Rockfish , but then they seemed to glance at each other and , before you could blink , the both of them shot down the length of the tank and huddled behind a piece of pink coral , sucking the glass in the corner for all they were worth . " They know , " I said . " One look and they knew . " " Look at the bright side , " she said . " Nothing 's happened yet . " " Not yet . But nothing ever happens when you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shopping or daydreaming or something that 's when it all happens . " " A big girl like you , " she said , giving me the once-over . " Ought to be married is what you ought to be . " " Thanks for the fish , Mrs. McDaniels . " I showed her to the door . " Listen . Keep me posted . My sister says they 're tough buggers , says they can eat nails . " " I 'll keep you posted , " I said , then I shut the door . For some reason , I began to snicker like crazy as soon as Mrs. McDaniels left . 1 went over to the tank , snickering , but The Rockfish only hung in the middle , sedate and ugly as sin . The two goldfish were still sucking away in the cor-ner . I had to lie down on the bed to keep from snickering . For a few minutes I thought maybe I was having a heart attack . There were these pins and needles in my arms and legs , this pain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after a while . I lay like a stick on the bed , trying to get some sleep , counting my breaths to relax a little . Maybe being late had me worked up . Usually I got through work at two in the afternoon , home by two-thirty , but that day I was all off . I could n't relax and I kept thinking about how I could n't , which of course just made things worse and aggravated me and gave me the feeling I was in a fix for good . I got to thinking , then , that my life was going to take a turn for the bad , that somehow I would be off-balance and out of step for the rest of whatever was corning . Across the room I could see the unclear , rat-colored shape of The Rockfish swimming the length of the tank , banking off the far walls , then swimming back again at the same latitude , back and forth , patrolling . And I wondered , to keep from snick-ering , to ward off the heart attack , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it know I kept count of things going on in the tank ? Did it know I had all its angles figured , its habits memorized ? Did it think I 'd almost massed my car around a fireplug and into a tele-phone pole ? Did it think I was a friend ? Islept like a dead man , because I did n't wake must have switched the tank light on earlier , because I almost never did . It gave me the creeps , as if the tank were the window onto some obscene green world where the tiniest ripple had profound ramifications , the kind of world you always suspect might happen to you suddenly , like Kingdom Come , if you lost all your habits . You lose your habits , and then you can kiss everything you 've gotten good at goodbye . I got out of bed , but things were still off somehow ; the feeling of things gone wrong was like a fur on my tongue . Usually I got home at two-thirty , ate something , then slept until about ten o'clock , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But that day I 'd overslept and was late to begin with , and I knew as if I 'd been through it before  --  which I had n't that trouble was just beginning . All I did was grab my keys and I was out of the apartment , almost sprinting to my car . Outside the wind grabbed hold , but 1 tucked my chin against it until I was inside the car , gripping the wheel and breathing hard . I figured by hurrying I could get a jump on whatever might come next , though when trouble comes , mistake number one is hurrying . I knew that , but I hurried just the same . On the way to the bar I kept my mind on driving , no funny business . There are nine bars in this town with regulation pool tables , and I always go to a different one each night , until I have to start over again . That night I was due for a bar called The Office , which is a nice enough place if you can stand seeing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oddly enough , it is a favorite hangout for secretaries during cocktail hours . They seem to like the idea of getting drunk surrounded by the paraphernalia of their daily lives . At night , though , the clientele switches over to factory workers and middle-level management types  --  supervisors , foremen  --  and you can pick up a nice piece of change . All the way to The Office I kept myself rigid as a fence post . Only one thing happened . I was passing the button factory , a big yellow building with two smokestacks that went at it all the time , burning bad buttons maybe . It struck me , as I passed , that those smokestacks looked a lot like pool cues aimed right for the sky  --  that 's all I thought , which was strange , but nothing to knock you off-balance . Nothing like banking your car off buildings . I 'd even begun to think I could relax a little by the time I got to the bar . Because The Office is situated among gas stations and retail stores , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for occasional street lamps . The plate glass in front glowed yellow like a small sunset surrounded by nothing at all and out in the middle of nowhere , the kind of sunset people plan dream vacations around , and a surerecipe for disappointment . For a moment I thought better of the whole thing , almost turned around and went home , but the fact of the matter was , I knew that if I did all was lost , because once you gave in you kept on giving in . A habit is as easily lost and forgotten as hope for a better shake in things . So I went on into the bar . As soon as I got inside I thought it would be all right . The two tables were busy , mostly guys in blue workshirts rolled up to the elbows , holding the cues like shotguns . It was promising because anyone in town recognized the blue workshirts . They came from the nuclear power plant up on the lake , the one that might or might not ever get built , which meant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away on a fifty-fifty possibility . I had played a foreman from the power plant once , a year before , and during the course of the game he explained that even though the job was dangerous half the time , the money they got was the real health hazard . " More of our men die from drunk driving , " he ' said , " than from touching the wrong wire , " and he said it in a proud , fisty sort of way . He was an electrical engineer from east Tennessee , where he said anything that happened had to happen big or else nobody noticed it from one valley to the next . I took him for twenty dollars , then he got unfriendly . But that 's the way with those guys : they see a woman playing pool and they automatically assume a fifty-fifty chance , usually more . Then they get unfriendly when they see you 've got a good habit . They just do n't know enough women . Numbers count . In The Office , to get to the pool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tables full of people who have had too much to drink . Cigarettes , flitting through the air on the tail end of a good story , are obstacles , and so are wayward elbows and legs . One sure sign that you 're drunk is if you 're in somebody 's way . But I got through that part . I made a beeline for Bernie , who was chalking his cue at the second table , the good table , the one with a roll you could figure . " You are tardy , " he said in his formal way , still chalking his cue . Sometime during his life , Bernie was a schoolteacher : astronomy . On certain nights he 'd take you outside and point out the constellations , his old nicotine-stained fingers pointing toward the stars . He knew his stuff . And he knew pool , too , except for a tendency to grow passionate at the least provocation , a tendency that combined with old age and Jack Daniel 's was ruining his game . Given a population of sixteen or seventeen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town . But we never played together , sometimes never saw each other for weeks ; we just appreciated the habits we 'd both gotten into . " You are tardy , " he repeated , giving me a dark look . " And the stars are out tonight . " He meant that people were spending money like nobody 's business . " I think it 's the wind , " I told him . " 1 think there 's something funny in the wind . " " Ha ! " Bernie cried . He put down the chalk and picked up his cigarette , puffing on it . Then , in a cloud of smoke , he wheeled around to the table , brought up his cue , and nailed the eight ball on a bank into the side pocket , easy as you please . It threw his opponent all off . His opponent had on a blue workshirt that was either too small for him on purpose or else was the biggest size they had : his muscles showed through the material as though he were wearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ball was left , sitting right in front of a corner pocket , and by the look on the guy 's face you could tell he 'd figured he had the old man on the run , the game sewn up . What he did n't know was that Bernie 's opponents in eight ball always had only one ball left on the table . But the guy was a good sport and paid his ten dollars without muscling around or hanging his cue on the floor , Sometimes with your big guys chaos is their only response to losing . It is just a fact of life . " That is that , " Bernie said , putting the ten in his wallet . " The table is all yours . " " Where you going ? " Bernie always stayed at the tables until about midnight , and if he was around , I just watched and took pointers , waiting for him to get tired and go home before I got busy . Usually I took over where he left off . " It 's only eleven , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are out . " " I have a granddaughter coming in on the midnight train . " He made a face that meant he was tickled pink , the corners of his mouth stretched and stained with a half million cigarettes . " All pink and yellow , like a little doll . She can point out Venus on the horizon with her eyes shut . A beautiful girl . You should meet her . " " Maybe I will . " " Seven years old and she knows the difference between Arcturus and Taurus . For Christmas last year , do you know what she told her mother she wanted ? Guess what she wanted . " " A pool cue , " I said , which was exactly what I would have asked for . " No , you are insane . A telescope ! She said she wanted to get close to the sky , close enough to touch it . She 's no bigger than a flea and she asks for a telescope ! " Bernie slapped his palms together , then sidled closer . " Between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My granddaughter , a genius . " " You must be proud of her , " I said . All of a sudden I wanted Bernie out of the bar . His verybreath smelled like trouble . Then I noticed his shot glass of Jack Daniel 's was missing from the stool he usually kept it on ; he was sober as a judge . I wanted Bernie gone . " Oh , she is going places , I can feel it . I can feel it ! " He slapped his palms together again , bouncing on his feet a little , then he swung toward the men in the workshirts and opened his arms enough to include me in the sweep of them . " Gentlemen , I leave you with this young lady as my proxy . Do not be fooled by her gender . " He looked at me appraisingly . " Do not be fooled by the uniform . She can handle herself : " " Thanks , Bernie , " I said , but I did n't look at him then , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I looked at all the guys in blue work-shirts . At first they each one had an expression of irritation and rebellion : they did n't like the idea of me usurping command of the table just because the winner knew me . And I did n't blame them , except that the next expression on each of their faces was a familiar one . " All right , George , you 're up , " one of them said . " Take her and then let 's us get serious , " he said , which was exactly what I had expected from their expressions . I could read these guys like a brochure . Any other night I would have grinned and aw-shucked around , leading them on a little bit . I might . have even offered to wait my turn , humbling myself to the point of idiocy , until they said , " No , you go on , honey , " gallantry making idiots of them , too . That night , though , something was wrong with me . For one thing , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeing Bernie sober and giddy as a billy goat really threw me . I had n't known he had a granddaughter or a daughter or even a wife . I 'd never seen him sober . Something about it all set me going again . I imagined flinging myself headlong into the knot of blue workshirts , sending them all flying to the far corners of The Office , like a good break . " O.K. , little lady , " said the one named George , winking and grinning to his friends . " Let 's see how you deliver . " He could not contain himself . " Did you hear that ? Did you hear what I just said ? I said , 1 asked her , ' Let 's see how you deliver . ' " They all snorted , stamping their cues on the end of their boots , and I regretted not changing out of my uniform . It was a bad sign because I 'd never worn it to the bars before , just one result of hurrying trouble . You never knew when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up your job , somebody with a poor attitude toward losing and a had disposition and a need for spreading chaos . I felt dizzy for a minute , as though I 'd been submerged in water and could n't make the transition . " Winners break , " George said . Now he was all business , ready to get the game over with so he could play with his friends . He strutted around , flexing his workshirt . Most nights , when I had the break , I would try to sink a couple , then leave the cue ball in a safe position , ducking my chin and smirking shamefacedly , as though I 'd miscalculated . The point is , never let the guys waiting in line see that your game in no way depends on luck ; it scares them if you do , shrinks their pockets like a cold shower , so to speak . But that night I was crazy , must have been . George went into an elaborate explanation of how he had to go to the bathroom but would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know he was gone . I said , " Five bucks . " He rolled his eyes comically , performing for his friends , then said it was all right by him . " You 're the boss , Chuck , " he said . I do n't know what got into me . Before George was out of sight , I broke and sank two stripes . Then I hammered in over who was up next . It was n't anything you could have predicted . I guess it pumped them up with adrenaline , or else with a kind of competitive meanness , because for the rest of the night they banged the balls with a vengeance . They were none too polite , and that 's a fact . Whatever happened during those games happened in a dream . A wad of five-dollar bills began to show through the back pocket of my uniform trousers . The guys in blue workshirts were like a buzzing of hornets around me , their faces getting drunker and redder every hour . Near closing time , around two in the morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd been watching him play on the other table , and even with the handicap of a dozen beers he could run five or six balls at a time , which is not embarrassing for bar pool . But there was real hatred on George 's face , sitting there like a signpost . All those beers had loosened his features until his the rest of them , taking maybe three seconds between each shot . By the time old George could zip up his pants , I 'd cleared the table . " Fucking-A , " said one of George 's friends . " Whoa , " another one said . " Holy whoa . " It was a dream , that whole game was a dream . I had read somewhere that a sure sign of madness was when life rook on a dreamlike quality , when you started manipulating what you saw as easily as you manipulate dreams . Those pins and needles came back into my feet , prickly as icicles . George came back , too . I figured the night was over . They would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attend to their beers . But  --  surprise  --  they ate it up , practically started a brawleyebrows met in a single , straight-edged line , the kind of eyebrows the Devil would have if he had eyebrows . Some men just ca n't get drunk without getting evil , too . I suggested we call it a day , but George would have none of it . He swaggered around , foulmouthed , until 1 said all right just to shut him up . " Fucking dyke , " he said , loud enough for me to hear . I kept racking the balls . He was the one who was supposed to rack them , but now I did n't trust him to rack them tightly . " I said , " he said , a little louder , " fucking dyke in a uniform . " He was drunk  --  and I should have known better  --  though , as I 've said , that day was the beginning of trouble . One rule of STORY 53 pool is never get emotional . You get emotional and first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game is a highly unclear business . " Asshole , " I told him . " Fucking asshole in a uniform . " My hands shook so much I gripped my cue as if it were George 's neck . I am not a grisly or violent person , but there you go . " Just play , for God 's sake , " said one of his friends . They were all grouped around the table , their faces as alike and featureless as the balls in front of them . I imagined that their eyes were the tips of cues , blue , sharp , nothing you wanted pointed in your direction . " Radiation mutant , " I said . " Rockfish . " Then I broke . Sure enough , emotion had its effect . None of the balls fell . " Fifty bucks , you pervert , " George said , rippling those eyebrows at me . " No , make it a hundred . " All that beer was working up some weird , purplish coloration into his cheeks . They say that during important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when you need it most . It is a falsehood . Time goes slowly when you 're utterly miserable , or when you might be about to die , and both are situations any sane person would want to go by quickly . When you really need it , time is n't there for you . I wanted to study the table for a while , get myself under control and ready . I wanted to go outside and have somebody point out the constellations , show me the difference between Taurus and Arcturus . I wanted somebody to give me a fish that did n't die in the tank . I wanted somebody , anybody , to tell me that I was living a good life , that my habits were excellent , that I was going places . " This is all she wrote , Chuck , " George said , leaning over the table like a surgeon . It looked grim , not because the spread was all in George 's favor  --  which was true  --  but because I had gotten emotional . Nothing was clear anymore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My cue stick might just as well have been a smokestack . " Shit ! " George cried , and he slammed a beefy hand against his beefy thigh . He 'd run the table except for the eight ball , leaving me with some tricky shots  --  stop signs all over the table . By now everyone in The Office stood around the table , watching , belching , not saying a word . I thought about what Minnesota Fats would do , how Fats would handle the situation , but all I saw was that corner of the poster , unstuck and curled ominously over Fats 's head . I wondered what would happen if I picked up each of my balls and placed them gently in the pockets , like eggs into Easter baskets . Crazy , I must have been crazy . The first couple of shots were easy , then it got harder . I banked one ball the length of the table , a miraculous shot , though it left the cue ballin an iffy position . I made the next one anyway . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my hand , get the feel of it all over again , as if I were in George 's league , an amateur on a hot streak . Finally the game came down to one shot . I had one ball left , tucked about an inch and a half up the rail from the corner pocket , an easy kiss except that the eight ball rested directly in the line of the shot . There was no way I could bank the cue ball and make it . " All she wrote , " George said , " all she by God wrote ! " I hefted my cue stick for a masse , the only thing left to do . " Oh no , " cried George . " No you do n't . You might get away with that shit in lesbo pool , but not here . You 're not doing it here . No sir . No way . " " Who says ? " 1 asked him , standing up from the table . I was sweating a lot , I could feel it on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Bar rules . " George appealed to his friends . " Right ? No masse in bar rules . Right ? Am I right ? " " Phineas ! " somebody called . " Phineas ! No masse on the tables , right ? " Phineas came out around the bar , rubbing his hands on an apron that covered him from the neck to the knees . He had short , black , curly hair and wore round wire-rimmed glasses , the kind of glasses that make people look liberal and intelligent somehow . He looked clean and trim in his white apron , surrounded by all those sweaty blue workshirts . For a minute he just stood there , rubbing his hands , sizing up the table . " What 's the stake ? " he asked philosophically . " Hundred , " George said . He was practically screaming . Phineas puckered his mouth . " Well , " he said , drawing the sound out . Maybe he was buying time . Maybe he was leading them on . Cr maybe he was a bartender @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asking for his opinion  --  which is exactly what he is . " Anything goes , " he said . " Anything goes for a hundred bucks is my opinion . " " I 'll remember this , " George said , snarling , his purple face shaded to green . " You prick , I 'll remember this . " " Fine , " said Phineas , almost jovially . He folded his arms across that white apron and looked at me . He might have winked , but more likely he was just squinting , sizing me up . " Masse on the ten into the corner , " I said stiffly , formally , the way Bernie would have done . Anybody will tell you , a masse is ridiculous . You have no real cue ball control , no real control period . You have to bring your stick into an almost vertical position , then come down left the cue ball in a perfect position for making the eight in the side pocket . Any idiot could have made that shot , and George was no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friendly when I paid him his money , wanted to take me home , his breath hot and sour as old beer . But then Phineas stepped in , cool as you please , and said that he was going home with me . Between the two there was no choice : 1 told Phineas to meet me out front at my car . " A ' 73 navy Impala , " I told him . It was not that unusual , even though the day had me off-balance . I 'd had a couple of guys over to my apartment before , after the bars closed , the kind of thing where in the morning you find yourself clenching the pillows , hoping they do n't use your toothbrush or something . Even if I did see those guys again , their faces would mean no more to me than the faces of former opponents in a pool game . The wind had died , nothing moved when I went out to the car . On the way to my apart-ment Phineas told me about how he hated crowds , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I told him numbers counted , but he did n't argue the point . Then he told me how nice my car was . " True grit , " I said . " Nothing spiffy , just good guts . " He put his hand on my thigh . We rode like that for a long time . When we passed the button factory , 1 told him about the smokestacks looking like pool cues . Then , for some reason , I told him about driving my car into telephone poles , banking it off buildings . " You should n't get all out of control over a game , " he said . After that I did n't tell him anything else , pretended I was concentrating on his hand against my thigh . Inside my apartment I did n't turn on the lights . The green glow of the fish tank let me seeall I wanted to see , maybe more . Phineas , of course , went right for the tank , which was what everybody did when they came into my apartment . " How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to know . " That one there , with the yellow freckles . It kills everything I put in there . Wait see . In the morning that other one wo n't be there . It 's a shark , " I said . " No kidding , " he said , peering in at The Rockfish . " Really ? A shark ? " " No . It 's just an it . A killer it . " Phineas straightened up . " What 's your - name ! ; , " Janice , " I said . " At least in this town it 's Janice , " I said , revealing myself a little , although I was n't about to go into heartfelt reasons for this and that . It did n't matter because then he kissed me , hard , standing there in front of the fish tank . In a minute or so , he broke away . " You can play your ass off in pool , Janice , " he said . He began to unbutton his shirt . It was flannel , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left back at the bar . I took off the trousers of my uniform , then he kissed me again , his hands down low . " You look real nice , " he said . " Out of uniform , as it were . " He laughed , and I laughed , too , in a strange kind of way . After that I was on the couch with him on top of me . He got busy . I put my hands on his back , but he did all the work ; The whole time I was thinking , my head to one side , staring into the fish tank . I was thinking that maybe I would leave town . Maybe I would pack up my car and move and get around my trouble that way . I could leave the fish tank , skip out on the rent , just like the guy before me had done . Let The Rockfish chew its own gristle , I thOught , let Mrs. McDaniels drop hints to somebody else . The Rockfish was patrolling the tank , whipping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the goldfish sucked madly on the glass in the corner , behind the pink coral , wriggling whenever The Rockfish swept by . It struck me as the saddest thing I 'd ever seen . Then I began it again , with Phineas this time . I imagined he was performing a masse on me , several masses , coming down hard on one side and then the other , one emotional shot after another , only I was n't going anywhere . 1 must have snorted , because Phineas worked harder all of a sudden . " Feel it ? " he said , or asked , whispering , and I could tell that he 'd come to a crucial moment . " Can you feel it ? " And I said , " Yes , " I said , " Yes , yes , I can feel it , " but I could n't . I shifted slightly to make things easier , but I could n't feel a thing , not a thing  --  nothing . ?
