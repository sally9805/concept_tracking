Young Hollywood moguls play with deadly force <P> FADE IN . INTERIOR . HOLLYWOOD OFFICE . <P> HOWIE HIP , 24 , a movie mogul who worked his way from Harvard to the William Morris agency mail room to the head of a major studio in just under three weeks , sits behind an expansive desk . He is screaming into the telephone . <P> HOWIE : Two million for that has-been ? What do you think this is , the Salvation Army ? His last movie did bubkes . The guy gets 40 grand , all of it deferred . This is war . Call me when you get smart . ( He slams down the phone . ) <P> DISSOLVE TO EXTERIOR . DESERT . DAY . <P> Howie , now clad in camouflage fatigues with matching loafers , crouches behind a cactus cradling a gun . A figure tiptoes out from behind a rock 30 ft. away . Howie fires ; a pellet of red paint splatters across the man 's chest . <P> HOWIE : You 're history , creep ! Do n't mess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town where life imitates screenplays , business resembles B war movies . Every morning baby moguls strap themselves into their BMWs and zoom off to wage battle and make deals at the studios . <P> But this elite corps has a more literal field of combat . The most dangerous game in town these days really is a game . Called Survival , it is a simulated war exercise like Capture the Flag in which players use paint-shooting guns to " eliminate " the enemy . First popularized in New England , each game lasts no more than an hour ; the victors must win two out of three . <P> Every other weekend a brigade of up-and-cunning Hollywood talent-including Adam Fields , vice president of production for Ned Tanen ; Actor Emilio Estevez ; Barry Josephson , a personal manager ; John Tarnoff , an independent producer ; Jeff ( " Mad Dog " ) Kanew , director of Revenge of the Nerds ; and led by International Creative Management Agent Jeremy Zimmer-troops off to the rugged brush of the Palmdale desert about an hour 's drive north of Los @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strategy and generally run around shrieking and shooting like underfed versions of SylvesterStallone in First Blood . Says Ron Rotholz , an assistant to Lawrence Gordon , president of 20th Century-Fox : " Survival is the name of the game in Hollywood . The game is a smaller version of the dog-eat-dog world of show biz . ' ' <P> On one recent Sunday morning the 17-man Hollywood squad is competing against a team composed of non-Hollywood types . They assemble on the boulder-strewn , ravine-lined battlefield . Most smear camouflage makeup on their faces . The wiry , cocksure Fields does not : " I want them to see who kills them . " He can taste it . " I 'm ready , " he deadpans . " I strangled my neighbor 's dog this morning . He was only a mutt . " A referee in the center of the field distributes to everyone a pistol , holster , carbon-dioxide cartridges , goggles and brightly colored " elimination " vests for those who are shot . Before departing , the referee warns the weekend warriors to be wary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You have to distinguish between the snakes in the field and the ones who come to play .
