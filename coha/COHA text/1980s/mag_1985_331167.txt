MORE THAN $60 <P> This monumental survey deserves to be published to the strains of the triumphal march from Aida . The Art of Ancient Egypt by Kazimierz Michalowski ( Abrams ; 600 pages ; $125 ) embraces some 5,000 years and 30-odd dynasties . Cheops , Tutankhamen , eleven Ramseses , a dozen Ptolemys and Cleopatra enliven a history that contains the seeds of the Western imagination . Polish Professor Michalowski links chapters on anthropology , language , society and craft with more than 100 pages of diagrams and maps . Some 900 pictures , including 145 in color , illustrate masterpieces of sculpture and painting seldom seen in print . Here , scholarship and grandeur are inseparable . <P> With his lively autobiography , Benvenuto Cellini ( 1500-1571 ) ensured his lasting fame . Yet that book has convinced many that the Renaissance man was more inspired as a boaster and self-promoter than as an artist . In Cellini ( Abbeville ; 324 pages ; $85 ) , Sir John Pope-Hennessy corrects this impression . Although much of Cellini 's early work in precious metals vanished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ careful detail ) to convince anyone of its creator 's genius . From the exquisite gold and enamel of The Saltcellar of Francis I to the muscular bronze of Perseus , the impression grows : Cellini was better than even he had the nerve to maintain . <P> This is a book with bite . Dentistry : an Illustrated History by Malvin E. Ring , D.D.S. ( Abrams ; 320 pages ; $75 ) ranges through time and twinges from the Maya Indians , who used tooth implants almost 1,400 years ago , to the latest microelectric techniques . What might have been a waiting-room time killer becomes instead a lively parade of names and incidents : Muhammad using an early version of the toothbrush ; Henry VIII granting a charter for dental surgery to barbers ; Paul Revere providing dental fillings before proceeding to larger items of silverware ; Charles Lindbergh posing with his grandfather , the inventor of the porcelain jacket crown . Seldom has dentistry been so educational . Never has it been so painless . <P> $30-$60 <P> The Renaissance in Northern Europe was different from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a deep and chillier current of &lt; piety , and its themes still reflected the medieval preoccupation with death and judgment . In Northern Renaissance Art ( Abrams ; 560 pages ; $45 ) , Art Historian James Snyder examines the intertwining paths of faith and art with erudition and style , aided by nearly 700 illustrations , from anonymous 14th century sculptures to the eloquent engravings and paintings of Albrecht Durer , Hans Holbein and Lucas Cranach . Most of the art dwells on religious themes , including some of Europe 's most arresting Nativity scenes . <P> As they prance and canter across the page , Gericault 's Horses ( Vendome ; 183 pages ; $60 ) assume a life of their own . French Artist Theodore Gericault brilliantly portrayed stallions and draft horses , Arabians and English racers in settings that vary from battlegrounds to stables . In his equestrian oeuvre , created over a span of some ten years , Gericault even depicted , with an unflinching naturalism , horses being devoured by lions . As Art Historian Philippe Grunchec notes , the painter 's devotion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of these works : he died in 1824 at age 32 of complications from a riding accident .
