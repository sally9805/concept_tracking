It is shortly after 2 in the morning , and Larry King is just hitting his stride . He has already spent an hour on TV grilling Negotiator Herb Cohen about the hostage crisis in Lebanon , and two more on radio talking with Jonathan Coleman , author of a book about the murder of Utah Millionaire Franklin Bradshaw . Now he is fielding phone calls on any and all subjects from his late-night radio audience . A New Yorker wants to know if the Yankees ' recent winning streak might lead to a pennant . ( " I do n't think their pitching is good enough , " King replies . ) A man asks King to recommend a doctor who can advise on the pros and cons of surgery for a separated shoulder . ( King obliges with the names of two former guests . ) Another call consists only of a disembodied recording of the opening theme from a 1960s TV series . ( King identifies it : Combat , starring Vic Morrow . ) All in a night 's work . <P> The broadcasting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inter viewers pose tough questions for high Administration officials ; ex-game show hosts lob softballs at starlets plugging their latest movies ; snarling radio talk-meisters shout angry opinions on everything from Ronald Reagan to Kareem Abdul-Jabbar . Amid this flood of verbiage , King provides a refreshing strain of intelligent , graceful conversation . For 71/2 years , that conversation has been largely confined to the middle of the night , on the Mutual Radio Network 's Larry King Show . Now King has ventured into prime-time TV as host of a nightly talk show on the Cable News Network : Larry King Live . <P> A former Miami broadcaster who never went to college and mismanaged himself into bankruptcy in 1978 , King does little or no research for guests and works without notes . " The best interviewers , " he insists , " are those who know least about a subject . I hate to ask questions I know the answers to . And I 've never been afraid to ask what might be a dumb question . " This deceptively simple formula is the basis of King @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job as an informed layman , intensely curious about virtually anyone who appears across his desk . He is obviously well read , a passionate sports buff and a sophisticated student of politics . Yet to an amazing degree he manages to set aside ego and loosen up guests with empathetic , probing but never baiting questions . " What I do best is create a sense of intimacy and comfort for the guest , " says King . " Larry listens to his guests , " says ABC Newsman Ted Koppel , one of his many fans . " He pays attention to what they say . Too few interviewers do that . " <P> Radio is King 's chosen medium , and the transition to TV has not been easy . Two years ago , he made his national TV debut on a misconceived syndicated program on which he was placed in front of a studio audience and forced to race through four to five interviews a show ( on radio he spends two hours with each guest ) . Says he : " They were trying to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
