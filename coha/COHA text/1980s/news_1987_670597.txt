The weekly press briefing by the Moscow Administration for Internal Affairs , conceived last summer as part of Mikhail S. Gorbachev ' s widening spotlight on domestic problems , has spawned regular crime columns in all three of the Moscow daily newspapers and helped finish off the official fantasy that street crime is an exclusive curse of capitalism. // Such stories as the mother who threw her child out the window , the former policeman nabbed for serial murders and the schoolboy crushed in an elevator shaft have become popular staples of the Moscow newspapers . <> <> The Discreet Touch // The Moscow police beat might strike tedium into the heart of a hard-bitten urban American crime reporter raised in the school of tabloid journalism . The police briefings are long on dry statistics , and the reporting is tucked under discreet headlines. // A low-key style seems to suit crime reporters like Oleg Bazilevich of Moskovskaya Pravda , who says , " I prefer not to pour too much blood on the page. " // Judged only by reported crime , Moscow is Camelot to New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crime among the nearly nine million inhabitants of Moscow may show 5 murders compared to 30 in New York , population seven million . Moscow police count about 60 burglaries a week ( New York 2 , 391 ) , 5 rapes ( New York 68 ) , 30 auto thefts ( 1 , 651 ) , and 750 fires ( 1 , 806 ) . <> <> Crimestoppers ' Tools // Crime is kept in check by enormous numbers of police unencumbered by Miranda rules and other citizen safeguards . The police are helped by strict controls on the populace , including an internal passport system that limits access to the major cities , and by a busybody quality that makes it hard to keep a misdemeanor secret . Violent crime is minimal , in part because weapons are not readily available . And there is a good deal less to steal. // Like any police blotter , Moscow ' s is a barometer of weather and temperament , trends and quirks , sociology and , yes , politics . <> <> From the Blotter // These are a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // * The snatch-and-run street thieves who , in Western countries , go for purses and gold chains , specialize here in " shapkas , " the omnipresent Russian fur hats . A sure sign of winter is that each week the report includes more cases of hapless Moscovites stripped hatless by fleet-footed thieves. // * Of the 715 apartment fires in Moscow last month , 90 were blamed on exploding television sets , a statistic the Soviet press has viewed as an alarming commentary on soviet technology . Police say three television models notorious for defective wiring are being removed from the market , and millions of warning leaflets have been mailed to television owners. // * Police recently reported with pride that they had in custody a Moscow man who sold his personal car for 12 , 800 rubles , a profit of 3 , 800 rubles over the purchase price . Sharp trading , an American might say . " Speculation , " the Moscow police say. // * Police said in October that they were searching for two African students who fled a Moscow clinic where they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The prostitution problem has escalated since several Moscow hotels , in an economy move , did away with the traditional floor attendants who dispense room keys , deliver tea , and snoop on the guests . Police say they counted on the tattling attendants as the first line of defense. // Prostitution , it seems , is one of the headaches the new openness has created for Moscow police . Before the press broke the poorly kept secret last year , prostitution was not illegal in the Soviet Union because the state pretended it did not exist. // Now that it exists - police estimate 2 , 000 prostitutes in Moscow , counting only those with multiple arrests - the state has established fines and police are expected to enforce them . But the men at Moscow vice say the prostitutes laugh off a 100 ruble fine , about $160 , when they can make four times that much in a night of cruising the tourist hotels. // " Absolutely ineffective , " said Yevgeny T. Chaikovsky , head of a Moscow police criminal division . <> <> Demon Drink Makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on drunkenness , alcohol remains the Soviet drug of choice and the leading cause of crime , according to the Moscow police. // Week after week , the police report thousands of people picked up for drunkenness , public drinking , peddling alcohol , or running home distilleries . Heists of liquor or industrial alcohols are common . Killings seem invariably to grow out of drunken quarrels. // Another revealing aspect of the police briefings is the high percentage of crimes committed by people who are " temporarily not working " or " without permanent address. " these reports tend to undermine the official claims that the Soviet Union has no unemployment or homelessness. // Mr. Bazilevich , who has written about crime for 28 years - he prefers " law and order " - said he sees it as part of his job to help in the struggle against lawlessness . He tries to provide enough detail to keep readers ' interest and to explain how each crime could have taken place , but without appealing to prurient interest. // " My main purpose is to tell people what the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to let people know that evil is punished , " he said . <> <> The Snoopy Press // Despite this sense of shared purpose , there are signs that the Moscow police regard the newly invigorated press with mixed feelings , especially the younger , more aggressive practitioners. // Komsomolskaya Pravda , the national youth newspaper , has made itself unpopular at 38 Petrovka St. by printing charges of police brutality against teen-age motorcycle gangs . Moskovsky Komsomolets , the city youth paper , fell from favor by disclosing how much money prostitutes make , an article the police claim worked like a recruiting ad. // Perhaps Mr. Chaikovsky had these cases in mind when , at a recent briefing , he was asked what kind of people end up becoming prostitutes . The police administrator peered out at the assembled correspondents as if inspecting a lower form of life and replied : " All kinds . From ordinary workers to your fellow journalists.
