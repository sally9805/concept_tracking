And U.S. aid to Nicaragua 's contra rebels <P> The sporadic clashes in the mountains and jungles of Nicaragua 's thinly populated northern provinces so far scarcely deserve to be called a war . The forces involved are minor . On one side are perhaps 2,000 exiles , known as contras , who have slipped back into the country from bases in Honduras , where they were trained as guerrillas ; on the other are a scattering of militia and border guards of Nicaragua 's Marxist Sandinista government . Casualties in the past month total a few hundred , of whom many were peasants killed almost at random . But the political struggle touched off in Washington by this low-level fighting is escalating rapidly , especially in Congress . Said one Administration official last week : " The temperature on Capitol Hill is higher than at any time during the past several months . " The issue that is causing all the heat : Does the Reagan Administration 's no-longer-secret aid to the contras violate U.S. law ? <P> The law in question is the Boland Amendment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ December . Ironically , it was adopted at the urging of the Administration , as a substitute for a far more restrictive measure proposed by Democrat Thomas Harkin of Iowa . Harkin 's rider would have banned U.S. support of any " military activities in or against Nicaragua " ; the CIA argued that this would prevent necessary covert actions aimed at reducing the flow of arms supplied by the Nicaraguan government to Marxist-led guerrillas in El Salvador . So the House accepted , 411 to 0 , a rider offered by Massachusetts Democrat Edward P. Boland , chairman of the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence , that merely repeated language written into an earlier appropriations bill . It forbade aid to guerrilla groups " for the purpose of over throwing the government of Nicaragua or provoking a military exchange between Nicaragua and Honduras , " presumably in the form of a Nicaraguan counterinvasion of Honduras to destroy the contras ' bases . <P> The contras , however , loudly if extravagantly proclaim their objective to be precisely the overthrow of Nicaragua 's increasingly repressive government . To that end , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually a series of hit-and-run raids by guerrillas operating inside Nicaragua . And a stream of reports by American newsmen who have visited contra bases in Honduras has left no doubt that the Administration is assisting them by supplying training , arms , and intelligence on troop movements in Nicaragua 's northern provinces gathered by spy plane . <P> Consequently , growing numbers of Congressmen are questioning whether the Administration is violating at least the spirit of the Boland Amendment , which it had pledged to obey . Thirty-six House Democrats and one Republican , Jim Leach of Iowa , raised the issue in a letter to the White House in late March . Last week Democratic Senators Patrick Leahy of Vermont and Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York , both members of the committee that oversees CIA operations , voiced their doubts on the Senate floor . Democrat Wyche Fowler of Georgia , just returned from a fact-finding visit to Nicaragua , declared , " No branch of our Government may pick and choose which statutes it will obey .
