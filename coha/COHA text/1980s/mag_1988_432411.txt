 | EVERYBODY KNOWS that Alexander Graham Bell invented the telephone . And on that point , at least , what everybody knows happens to be true . But there is another common belief that runs afoul of the Bell story . Nowadays we take it for granted that success depends on specializing , keeping one 's eye on the ball . So thought most people in Bell 's day too . " Put all your eggs in the one basket , " wrote Mark Twain , " and ? WATcH THAT BASKET . " We might suppose , therefore , that Bell proceeded on the one-basket plan . Fortunately he did not . If he had , he would never have invented the telephone . It was simply not in Bell 's nature to fixate for long on " the one basket . " All his life he retained a child 's joy in the world 's diversity . But before he became world-famous , Bell 's love of diversity raised misgivings in some who knew him . His prospective father-in-law chided him for his tendency " to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of any value to any one . " That was less than five months before the telephone was patented . What saved him from mere aimless skittering was his capacity for total absorption in the concern of the moment ? another trait ? that might be called childlike . " My mind , " he once wrote , " concentrates itself on the subject @# that happens to occupy it and then all things else in the Universe ? including father , mother , wife , children , life itself , become for the time being of secondary importance . " If those traits were innate , external circumstances confirmed them , beginning with the Scottish city where he was born in 1847 . In its very contours Edinburgh encouraged a roving eye and spirit . Some cities convey their impatience with the horizontal , their urge to be up and doing , through the work of human hands ? cathedrals , towers , skyscrapers . In others nature lends a hand : They are cities upon hills . Edinburgh was that kind of town . Young Bell 's favorite vantage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view over the elegant New Town and Leith docks to the sea . On the crest of Corstorphine the boy was close to the sky , and below him circled the alluring horizon . Lying at peace on the grassy slope , Aleck watched the birds make their mysterious way , and this more than all else stirred his envy and wonder . Something more than terrain , however , National Geographic , September 1988  | made Edinburgh a tonic to the mind . Its own people , and others too , called it the Athens of the North ( as well as " Auld Reekie " for its coal smoke ) . For generations Edinburgh had been a center of culture second only to London : n the British Empire . The glorious tradition of David Hume in philosophy , Adam Smith in economics , Robert Burns and Sir Walter Scott in literature , James Hutton in geology , and the great civil engineer Thomas Telford in technology remained strong in Bell 's boyhood . The University of Edinburgh had long maintained a faculty ranking with the world 's best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Edinburgh mind was exuberant versatility . Another son of Edinburgh , Robert Louis Stevenson , three years Aleck Bell 's junior , quite naturally included in his Child 's Garden of Verses a jaunty couplet : " The world is so full of a number of things , I 'm sure we should all be as happy as kings . " BELL 'S OWN FAMILY embodied the Edinburgh spirit . Aleck stood in awe of his father , Alexander Melville Bell , a successful elocutionist and speech teacher . As befitted his vocation , the elder Bell was a man of impressive bearing and fine address . Lecturing regularly at the University of Edinburgh , coaching teachers , ministers , and the children of titled families , he kept in touch with the intelligentsia of the 363  | city . More than that , he qualified as one of them by research and publication . For years he pursued a century-old dream of elocutionists and phoneticians , scientifically analyzing vocal sounds in order to develop a complete and universally applicable system of phonetic notation . At last in 1864 he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Aleck in his late teens became adept in it and helped his father demonstrate it to linguists and phoneticians in London as well as Edinburgh . They hailed it as a major advance . Aleck 's mother , Eliza Bell , had meanwhile added still another dimension to her son 's widening world . Though her hearing was severely impaired , she was a good pianist , achieving feedback by fastening her ear tube to her ear and resting the mouthpiece on the soundboard . The bond between mother and son was strong . More than his two brothers , Aleck as a child had a knack for bypassing the ear tube and communicating in a low voice close to her forehead . He too showed pianistic talent and studied for a time with a leading pianist , dreaming of glory as a virtuoso . Then his teacher died , and the dream too . Science also captured the boy 's imagination . He collected botanical specimens until the drudgery of memorizing nomenclature dulled his fervor . Zoology engaged him for a while . He had no heart to kill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specimens , he explored their insides . And he tried his hand at technology . The father of a playmate owned an old gristmill on a nearby stream , a fascinating place for the two boys to play . One day , wearying of their cavorting , the miller challenged them to do something useful , such as taking the husks off the grain . Aleck set about experimenting and came up with a workable device involving rotating paddles in a brush-lined cylinder . That , he wrote many years later , " was my first incentive to invention . " Thus early , Aleck Bell whirled around happily on a carousel of hobbyhorses ? phonetics , physiology , pianos , deafness , invention , elocution , the flight of birds , and the intoxicating panorama of the wide world . Yet , for all their seeming incongruity , hindsight reveals a prophetic convergence , a concealed focus : the art , science , and technology of communication . A hint of what lay ahead came with a project the elder Bell urged on Aleck and his older brother , Melville @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a year with his paternal grandfather , who taught speech in London . The old man had polished Aleck 's elocution , held him to serious reading and study , instilled in him ideals of social and political democracy , and converted him , as Aleck later wrote , " from a boy somewhat prematurely into a man . " Cut off from friends of his own age , however , Aleck had come home graver and more withdrawn than before , resentful of now being " treated as a boy again . " So his father challenged him and Melville to collaborate in making a " speaking machine , " a device for mechanical production of vocal sounds , one such as Aleck and his father had lately seen in London . After studying a lamb 's larynx given them by a butcher , the boys constructed a model of the vocal organs , which could be shaped and positioned by levers . Operated by blowing through a tube , it made voicelike sounds . The project helped rekindle Aleck 's youthful spirit . And as the father doubtless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speech . The fascination carried over when Aleck at last tasted independence as a teenage instructor for two years at a boys school in Elgin , on the northern coast of Scotland . With his musical ear and some ingenious experiments with tuning forks and various shapings of his mouth and throat cavities , he found that each vowel sound is a compound of two pitches and that in a certain sequence one rises and the other falls as the sequence progresses . What was  | more , he deduced the physiological basis of the phenomenon . Like the paired pitches , Bell 's spirits both rose and fell when he learned from a London phonetician that the great scientist Hermann von Helmholtz had already made the same discovery . Helmholtz had reached the finish line first , to be sure , and that was disappointing . But the 19-year-old Bell had independently run the same course , and that was grounds for pride . More important , Bell was intrigued by Helmholtz 's device for keeping each of his tuning forks vibrating : an intermittent electrical current of the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ electromagnet near the fork . Bell told friends that someone , someday , would go on to transmit speech and music by telegraphy . After Elgin , Bell taught in a boys preparatory school at Bath , England , meanwhile tinkering with batteries and telegraphic instruments . But his younger brother , Edward , died of tuberculosis that year , leaving his parents alone in his late grandfather 's house on Harrington Square , London . So Aleck , now 20 , joined them and took up the family vocation of phonetics and speech training . At a nearby private school in 1868 the young man first tried his skill at teaching speech to deaf children , four bright little girls . Perhaps his mother 's deafness gave him a special feeling for them . With the help of Visible Speech and Bell 's talent as a teacher , the girls learned quickly and joyously . Aleck had found his true calling . Even after inventing the telephone , he would write , " Of one thing I become more sure every day ? that my interest in the deaf is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true to his word , he would list " teacher of the deaf " as his profession to the end of his days , notwithstanding a perennial counterpoint of other pursuits . Music remained one of those other interests . Playing the piano at Harrington Square , Aleck became fascinated with the phenomenon of sympathetic vibration . By singing into the piano he could sound the wire that matched the pitch of his voice . He noticed also that the sound of a piano chord coming through a thin wall from the adjoining apartment was faintly echoed by the National Geographic , September 1988  | corresponding wires of his piano . The foreshadowings of a momentous concept thereupon formed in Bell 's mind . If the different frequencies of several tuning forks were transmitted simultaneously over a single wire , they , like the piano chord , could be separated out by similarly tuned forks at the other end . Thus a number of Morse code messages could be sent at the same time over a single wire . But other events jostled this notion into the background . In 1870 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that Victorian scourge , tuberculosis . His father , on a recent professional tour of North America , had been captivated by the go-ahead spirit and bracing climate there . An invitation to give a lecture series in Boston now inspired him to make a New World home near some transplanted Scottish friends in Brantford , Ontario . In the hope of saving his only remaining son from the fate of the other two , he persuaded Aleck to come along . The elder Bells settled comfortably in an ample house outside Brantford amid twelve acres of woods , fruit trees , and outbuildings on a high bluff overlooking the Grand River . When the elder Bell , warmly received in Boston , was asked to introduce the Visible Speech method there at a new school for deaf children , he referred the offer to Aleck , who accepted it eagerly . Boston was an American Edinburgh , even to claiming the title Athens of America ( as well as the self-mocking nickname " hub of the solar system " ) . Harvard , the nation 's oldest college , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eliot ; and other schools , like Boston College , MIT , and Boston University , had sprung up in the 1860s to enrich the academic scene . Boston businessmen were developing mines and railroads in the West , while industry and commerce continued to prosper at home . Most significant for Aleck 's future , Boston was the leading center of American science and technology , including electricity . On his own at last , Bell flourished in Boston . His visible enthusiasm , made all the more dramatic by his jet black hair and expressive face , communicated itself to his deaf pupils , 367  | and his resonant , well-modulated voice also charmed Bostonians who could hear . Impressed by his results , other schools invited him to demonstrate his methods . In 1873 he joined the faculty of Boston University as professor of vocal physiology , thus gaining status in academic circles . MEANWHILE Bell somehow found time and energy to pursue science and invention . Boston 's intellectual strengths invited that . On the day of his arrival someone had given him a copy of John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that MIT had a complete set of Helmholtz 's apparatuses . In 1872 , at a Michigan convention of deaf-school principals , he delivered a paper in which he described speech scientifically as a " mere motion of the air , " a series of undulations . That October he heard Tyndall lecture in Boston on the " undulatory theory " of light propagation . During the same month the newspaper in which Bell advertised his speech lessons reported that Western Union had paid handsomely for rights to another Boston inventor 's " duplex telegraph , " which by an ingenious arrangement of circuits could transmit a message in each direction simultaneously over a single wire . That was probably what turned Bell 's mind back to his London concept of a multiple telegraph on the quite different plan of superimposed frequencies . Bell began working feverishly , experimenting by night while teaching by day , thus confirming his lifelong night-owl habits . Then , in the spring of 1874 , a well-received lecture he gave at MIT on speech training for the deaf brought Bell an invitation to use the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telegraphy to acoustics . One device especially caught his eye because it made speech " visible . " Called a " phonautograph , " it had a diaphragm with an attached bristle that , while vibrating in response to a vocal sound , traced an undulating curve on a strip of smoked glass being drawn past it . That summer , at the " dreaming place " on the Brantford bluff , watching the Grand River meander sinuously far below , Bell let a kaleidoscope of miscellaneous notions swirl about in his mind . Complex sound vibrations , conveyed through a single point by the phonautograph diaphragm and expressed as a wavy line . The surprising power of sound 369  | waves to move small bones in the ear . Complex undulatory electrical currents , generated by the vibration of a magnetized reed and passing over a single wire . Piano strings echoing a voice . Suddenly the jumble fused into a great insight : the fundamental principle of the telephone . His magnificently simple inspiration depended on no scientific discovery or natural phenomenon that had not been well-known for nearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it before Bell did ? Many an expert on electricity ( and on electricity alone ) asked himself that question when he heard of it . Bell 's fellow native of Edinburgh , the great physicist James Clerk Maxwell , had an answer . " I consider the telephone , " said Maxwell in his last public lecture , " as a material symbol of the widely separated departments of human knowledge , the cultivation of which has led , by as many converging paths , to the invention of this instrument by Professor Graham Bell . " The electrical experts had put all their eggs in one basket and watched only that basket . Committed to the telegraph , they could not stand back far enough to see the promise of a radically different approach to communication . Even if they had seen it , their electrical expertise would have suggested more technical barriers than openings . In going on to make the telephone a reality , Bell drew on Boston 's varied resources . Boston scientists and technologists assured him that his idea was theoretically sound ( fortunately one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1874 ) . The shop of Charles Williams , Jr. , was a center of custom work for electrical inventors ( young Tom Edison had frequented it not long before ) , and there Bell engaged the skills of 20-year-old Tom Watson to help in experimental work . In March 1876 Watson clinched his place in history as the first to answer a telephone call . Financing came from two Yankee businessmen , Gardiner Greene Hubbard and Thomas Sanders , each of whom had a deaf child under Bell 's tutelage . Bell had fallen in love with one of those pupils , 17-year-old Mabel Hubbard . During the summer and fall of 1875 , in the spirit of folktales and Victorian romances , he won the promise of her hand over her parents ' opposition ( the Hubbards had thought her too young to make such a decision ) . In due course they would marry and live happily ever after . But the courtship delayed the framing and filing of his telephone patent . So did his Boston University classes and private pupils , and likewise his insistence on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I rush from one thing to another and before I know it the day has gone ! " he wrote his parents . Finally Gardiner Hubbard lost patience and took it upon himself to file the patent application on February 14 , 1876 . FOR A FEW YEARS Bell accepted the nominal role of technical adviser to the telephone company . Even so , true to his temperament , he refused all along to be bound to that or any other single line of work , including his university position . To him the financial independence ( though not a great fortune ) that the telephone gave him meant instead that he could yield happily to his bent for variety . And yield he did for the more than four decades left to him . He kept on inventing . After a long honeymoon in England and Scotland , he and his wife settled near her parents in Washington , D. C. , where he set up his own laboratory . Impressed by Thomas Edison 's Menlo Park " invention factory , " he tried to replicate it on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different . Edison tended to identify a commercial need and then look for a way to meet it . Bell was more likely to be struck by a physical phenomenon and then look for a way to use it . In 1873 , for example , the element selenium had been found to have a strange property : Its electrical conductivity increased with the intensity of the light that fell on it . Intrigued by the effect , Bell saw that if a light could be varied in intensity by the sound of a voice , the light could be beamed over a distance to affect selenium as the variable-resistance element in a telephone transmitter . Thus speech could be transmitted without wires . With the help of a young technician named Sumner Tainter , whom he hired as the equivalent of Tom Watson , Bell produced his " photophone " in 1880 . Until the end of his life Bell insisted that it was " the greatest invention I have ever made ; greater than the telephone , " perhaps because he hated to admit that his career as inventor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a range of only a few hundred feet , and then only if there were no fog , rain , snow , smoke , National Geographic , September 1988  | or intervening obstacles to obscure its beam . So it had no commercial value . In 1881 Bell did , like Edison , invent for a practical purpose . President James A. Garfield lay slowly dying from the wound of an assassin 's bullet that surgeons could not locate . Working nearly around the clock , Bell came up with two devices to help out . One was an adaptation of the induction balance , which worked like a present-day mine detector by changing a telephone tone when it passed over metal . The other was a telephonic probe , combining a needle with a telephone receiver so as to produce an audible click when it touched metal . But the bullet was too deep for the induction balance to detect , and the surgeons chose not to try the probe , though afterward it was much used until X rays supplanted it . So Garfield ? " that brave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ died . In that same sad summer the Bells ' newborn son died from respiratory failure . His grief spurred Bell to invent a " vacuum jacket , " an airtight iron cylinder surrounding a patient 's torso up to the neck and , fitted to that , a pump that could rhythmically raise and lower air pressure inside , thus compressing and expanding the lungs . The device anticipated the iron lung developed five decades later for polio victims . IN THE EARLY 1880s Bell turned the tables on Edison . A few years before , Edison had leapfrogged Bell by inventing the carbon-button transmitter , which made the telephone more effective . Bell now took up Edison 's phonograph , which Edison had let remain a laboratory toy , its recordings short , poor in quality , good for only a few plays , and not adaptable for mass duplication . In improving the phonograph , Bell was more the manager of his team than an active player . He relied chiefly on his cousin Chichester Bell and Sumner Tainter . The team 's patents helped make the phonograph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bell used his share to endow research on deafness . Bell continued to lead a busy life , but for a few years invention took a backseat to other activities . One of them , in the late 1880s , was the creating of a northern Eden , a summer @#  | retreat near Baddeck , Nova Scotia , to which he gave the Gaelic name Beinn Bhreagh ( pronounced Ben VREE-ah ) , meaning " beautiful mountain . " Though he had become a United States citizen , he was soon dividing his year between Beinn Bhreagh and Washington . BY THEN , as he entered his 40s , Bell 's mien had grown appropriately baronial . Soon after inventing the telephone he had begun to put on weight , an accepted ? indeed , expected ? mark of Victorian success . From the slender , dark-haired suitor of Mabel Hubbard , Alec ( as she spelled it ) became her stout , prematurely graying husband . On their honeymoon he had grown a connective copse of whiskers between his sideburns and now rivaled the physical presence of his uncle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " by far the most majestic and imposing looking man that ever lived on this or any other planet . " Alec and Mabel made a striking couple . With a heritage of Yankee leanness , she remained slim and graceful all her life , the picture of elegance on formal occasions . Her startling facility in speechreading helped her feel at ease in such gatherings and bring her sometimes reserved husband into more social contacts . They leaned on each other . " Deafmutes , gravitation or any other hobby has been too apt to take the first place in my thoughts , " he wrote her once , " and yet ... you have grown into my heart , my darling , and taken root there , and you can not be plucked out without tearing it to pieces . " They needed that mutual support when their two sons died in infancy , losses that haunted them throughout their later lives . But their daughters , Elsie and Marian ( known to the family as Daisy ) , both destined to long life , not only gave them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growing clan of descendants . Seven children were born to Elsie and her husband , Gilbert H. Grosvenor , including Melville Bell Grosvenor , in youth a lively companion for his grandfather and in maturity his father 's successor at the helm of the NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC magazine . Daisy and her husband , the noted botanist David Fairchild , added three more to the roster of Bell descendants . With all these , as well as the Bells ' parents and other relatives by blood or marriage , there were times when the big house material deleted 374  | He had taken up the lately invented Hargrave , or box , kite and expanded it into huge kites of several boxlike cells . Seeking a frame as strong and yet as light as possible , he began combining and arranging triangles , which unlike rectangular elements needed no internal bracing . Then on August 25 , 1902 , in a rush of inspiration like that of the telephone conception , he suddenly saw the structural implications of a pyramidal figure with three triangular sides and a triangular base ? saw them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ geometric term for it , tetrahedron . One of the most remarkable pages in Bell 's notebooks is the one of that date in which he sketched the form and added : " I believe it will prove of importance not only in kite architecture ? but in forming all sorts of skeleton frameworks for all sorts of constructing ? a new method of architecture . May prove a substitute for arches ? and bridge work generally . . . . Whole structure so solid and so perfectly braced by its construction that it may be treated as a solid body ... . May be used . . . for . . . ceilings of large buildings &c....; All the parts can be made of metal ? &; made cheaply . " This was a clear vision of what later came to be known as space-frame architecture , made famous by Buckminster Fuller . Yet , though Bell patented it , publicized it , and demonstrated it with a light but soaring tower on Beinn Bhreagh , its time had for some reason not come . Many years later it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quest for flight , engaging as his assistant a young engineer , Frederick " Casey " Baldwin , as a successor to Watson and Tainter . Eventually Bell brought together a high-spirited group of other young men , including Glenn Curtiss , organized as the Aerial Experiment Association . The Wright brothers had by then risen above their own kite experiments to create a true airplane , and so the AEA built on that , developing 380 several successful machines . Bell himself conceived the important feature known as the aileron , or wing flap , unaware that the French had anticipated him . In 1908 Bell and Casey Baldwin began a long series of experiments to improve hydrofoil boats , which had lately been introduced in Italy . Baldwin did the designing , while Bell contributed suggestions and critiques . In 1919 their fourth experimental hydrofoil craft ? HD-4 ? set a world marine speed record of 70.86 miles an hour , a record that stood for ten years .  | SINCE HIS YOUTH Bell had craved recognition as a scientist . His work in vocal physiology won him some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in grand though nebulous theories of gravitation , energy , and other aspects of physics . But like Edison , and indeed most American physicists of that period , he lacked the mathematical sophistication increasingly necessary for theoretical work , and he was realistic enough to refrain from publishing his speculations . He did , however , win the high honor of election to the National Academy of Sciences and contributed five papers to the academy 's proceedings , mostly on aspects of heredity . Some other scientific papers grew out of his inventive work . Bell 's most notable scientific work dealt with deafness . He helped apply his telephone as an audiometer for measuring degrees of deafness . His name eventually entered the language in the standard measure of relative differences in sound intensity , the decibel . More fundamental were his studies of inherited propensity to deafness , of which he found some evidence .  | Bell 's interest in heredity drew him into an early stage of the movement called eugenics , or genetic upgrading of the human race . Fortunately his good sense and innate decency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with racism , of which he was an active foe . He addressed his research instead to the innocuous question of whether long life was hereditary . He concluded that it seemed to run in families , but could not be distinguished clearly from inherited physical stamina or disease resistance . Bell also left his mark on science as a patron and organizer . In 1881 he financed a major phase of Albert Michelson 's classic experiments establishing that direction had no effect on the speed of light . In 1882 he rescued the foundering journal Science and helped finance it for nearly a decade . Later the American Association for the Advancement of Science adopted it as its official journal , and it flourishes today as the voice of the world 's greatest scientific community . And not least Bell , himself a world traveler , advanced scientific exploration and communication as President of the National Geographic Society and as a shrewd adviser to the Society 's magazine , edited by Bell 's brilliant son-in-law Gilbert H. Grosvenor . Despite all his other projects , Bell remained faithful to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he helped launch a public day school for deaf children . Later , in Washington , he opened his own private school for deaf children and conducted it with love , skill , and zeal . He also became a champion , mentor , and longtime friend of the blind and deaf Helen Keller , who dedicated her autobiography to him . When he was past 70 , she wrote him , " You have always shown a father 's joy in my successes and a father 's tenderness when things have not gone right . " " His dominating passion is his love for children , " Helen once wrote . He loved to visit classes , and the children loved to see him . During one such visit to a school for the deaf he reported to Mabel , " some of the youngest children . . . somehow got the idea that I was no less an individual than Santa Claus himself ! The children were much puzzled to know how so big a body could come down so small a chimney . I taught them the word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! ! I 'm afraid that half of the school will write to me before Christmas and I shall have to visit the school in appropriate costume ! " Bell gave the cause of the deaf nearly half a million dollars , a sizable share of his income over the years . Some went in small sums to distressed individuals , most to schools and an association for the deaf . More important , Bell gave leadership and the weight of his eminence to the cause as he saw it ? to conquer the solitude of deafness in any way possible . He campaigned for public day schools where deaf children could learn without being cut off from their families and the hearing world . THE WORLD AND ALL THAT IS IN IT is our theme . " That was Alexander Graham Bell 's expansive advice to young Gilbert Grosvenor as a newly appointed editor of the NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC magazine . It perfectly described the mind and spirit of Bell himself . In the last months before his death in 1922 , Bell remained true to his nature , working on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Encountering the newest household marvel , a radio , and remembering a musical tone he had heard upon sending an intermittent current directly through his ears half a century before , he wondered if somehow one might " hear the radio concert without any special receiver at all . " Perhaps he was dreaming of music for Mabel . So he ended as he began , exploring the world and everything in it , captivated by its multiplicity of possibilities . However many blind alleys it led him into , Bell 's passion for miscellany also brought him to insights and humanitarian achievements , any one of which would have made a lifetime fulfilling for most of us . And even if Bell 's lifetime of seeking and helping had brought him nothing else , it would have brought him joy . There too may lie a moral for our specialized times .
