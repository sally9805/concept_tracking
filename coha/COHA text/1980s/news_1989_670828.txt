It is the literary event of the season , marking the nation ' s rediscovery of its most prominent exile . Parts of lesser Solzhenitsyn works have been printed by minor publications in recent years , but the author had insisted that " Gulag , " his scathing description of Stalinism and its prison camps , be published before his other works , like the novels " Cancer Ward " and " The First Circle. " // Nikita S. Khrushchev approved the publication of some of Solzhenitsyn ' s work in the early 1960 ' s , but since the mid-60 ' s , his writing has been banned . The publication of " The Gulag Archipelago " this week was approved by President Mikhail S. Gorbachev. // // Long War With Bureaucrats // Its publication is a personal triumph for Sergei P. Zalygin , the 75-year-old chief editor of Novy Mir ( New World ) , who battled top Communist Party officials for more than a year to publish a work that explicitly lays the blame for evil in the Soviet Union at the feet of Lenin. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sanctuary of liberal Russian thought , at a time when thinking Russians are trying to decide where their hearts lie. // Through Stalin ' s terror and Khrushchev ' s thaw , Leonid I. Brezhnev ' s stagnation and the glasnost-dizziness of Mr. Gorbachev , Novy Mir , a thick monthly with a powder-blue cover , has been the country ' s best literary journal. // Mr. Solzhenitsyn , who had a tempestuous author ' s affair with the magazine , once wrote that " Novy Mir was the only judge in Soviet literature whose artistic and moral verdict on a work commanded assent , and indelibly marked its author. " // Mr. Solzhenitsyn has refused to consider suggestions that he return to the Soviet Union from his chosen exile in Vermont . But the Soviet Writers Union has restored his membership , and many here hope the publication of his works will lead to a visit. // When Moscow intellectuals first passed illicit copies of " Gulag " hand to hand in the 1970 ' s , devouring it hastily at night , they were dumbstruck by the meticulous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cruelties of the camps are familiar to Soviet readers from numerous memoirs liberated by glasnost - some of them in Novy Mir - from journalistic investigations and dramatizations on the stage and in films . Like Mr. Solzhenitsyn , modern authors have begun to implicate Lenin in the system of repression . <> <> Writer ' s Courage Cited // What remains exhilarating about the book today , said Margarita V. Timofeyeva , Novy Mir ' s prose editor , is Mr. Solzhenitsyn ' s personal example of endurance and courage. // " For the past year , we ' ve been publishing these documentary , gloomy things , " she said . " Now we all feel like lifting our eyes from destructive things to - well - not to comforting ones , but at least to healthier ones. // " What is so unexpected reading ' Gulag ' today is that it is such a spiritually uplifting work.

Wittingly or not , he has attracted a circle of disciples who blame the West , and especially Jews , for exterminating Russian culture. // Conservative Russian nationalists consider Mr. Solzhenitsyn a martyr to the worldly ideology of Marx and Lenin , and an icon of ancient Russian values of faith and discipline they now see threatened by the Westernizing influence of Mr. Gorbachev. // " It would be in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the novelist Andrei Bitov . " But the very second we begin , we become hostile camps - liberals and chauvinists , Russophiles and Russophobes. " // All the same , Mr. Bitov said , ending the ban on Solzhenitsyn is a prerequisite for a civilized discussion of which path the nation should take . <> <> Fulcrum of Discussion // In that debate , Novy Mir occupies a key centrist position , attempting to reconcile the Westernizers and the Russian patriots on a common ground of tolerance and democratic ideals. // The magazine has lately focused attention on the more Western-inclined 19th-century Russian thinkers such as Nikolai Nekrasov , Aleksandr Herzen , and the Christian philosophers Vladimir Solovyov and Nikolai Berdyayev , seeking a humane alternative to zealous Leninism and the darker Russian nationalism. // " I am often accused of being neither a right-winger or a left-winger , of being no-one-knows-what , " said Mr. Zalygin , who alone among editors of major Soviet publications is not a member of the Communist Party . Speaking in an interview with the weekly Moscow News , he continued , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the beginning , Novy Mir has maintained a measure of independence from the prevailing orthodoxy. // Two years after the magazine ' s debut in 1924 , Stalin took offense at a story by the novelist Boris Pilnyak that pilloried soulless party bureaucrats . He had all issues confiscated , and Pilnyak later disappeared in Stalin ' s purges . <> <> ' Paltry , Nihilistic ' // Under Khrushchev and Brezhnev , the magazine found room for writers of unconventional style and views , so much so that a popular weekly once denounced Novy Mir as " that paltry little journal that spreads its nihilistic poison among our intelligentsia. " // Often the magazine compromised , or flattered party leaders by publishing their works of dubious merit , such as Brezhnev ' s self-glorifying " Small Earth . " But most of the great voices of contemporary literature were published first in the pages of Novy Mir. // Aleksandr T. Tvardovsky , the editor from 1958 until his forced retirement in 1970 , was the most successful in negotiating the censorial shoals , and his scarred desk is preserved in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of shrine. // It was Mr. Tvardovsky who in 1962 introduced Mr. Solzhenitsyn to the public with " One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich , " the simple story of a labor-camp inmate . Khrushchev personally approved the publication as part of an intrigue against Stalinist rivals in the leadership. // " A. T. thought his magazine extremely daring and progressive - witness its great success with the great Soviet intelligentsia and the close attention paid it by the Western press , " Mr. Solzhenitsyn wrote in his 1975 memoir , " The Oak and the Calf. " // " Well , there was some truth in that , " he judged , but only in comparison to " the general ruck of uninspired journals , with their emetic subject matter and their deadening indifference to artistic quality. " // " I still can not help feeling that whatever Novy Mir did , it came nowhere near the limits of the possible , " he wrote . <> <> Some Work Was Omitted // Mr. Tvardovsky could not , or did not dare to put Mr. Solzhenitsyn ' s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when Mr. Solzhenitsyn pressed him to print other courageous writing , such as Varlam Shalamov ' s prison-camp stories. // Novy Mir finally published Mr. Shalamov ' s tales last year. // " Novy Mir has never been quite as progressive as is customarily assumed , " Mr. Bitov said . " It was the only one , and that created the reputation of progressiveness. " // Under Mr. Gorbachev , Novy Mir is no longer alone , but its pre-eminence continues. // " Even if in a given year Znamya or Oktyabr published more interesting material , Novy Mir would still be No. 1 - but ill , " said the short-story writer Tatyana Tolstaya . " We would say , " The czar is ill . " <> <> Business Is Good // Just now , the czar ' s health is robust. // Circulation has tripled in two years , to more than 1. 5 million . Mr. Zalygin was elected in March to the new national Congress of People ' s Deputies. // In the face of fierce competition to take advantage of glasnost , Novy Mir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Bitov ' s banned novel , " Pushkin House , " the poems of the emigre Nobel laureate Joseph Brodsky , Boris Pasternak ' s " Doctor Zhivago " and , earlier this year , George Orwell ' s " 1984 " have all been printed in Novy Mir. // The magazine ' s commentary section has stirred debate with the biting , market-oriented economic critiques of Nikolai Shmelyov and Vasily Selyunin , articles searching for the roots of Stalinism , and Mr. Zalygin ' s passionate crusades for the protection of the tortured Soviet environment. // " In our byzantine way of thinking , someone must be No. 1 , " said Mrs. Tolstaya . " Repin is the No. 1 painter , Tchaikovsky is the No. 1 composer , Pushkin is the No. 1 poet , and Novy Mir is the No. 1 literary magazine. " //
