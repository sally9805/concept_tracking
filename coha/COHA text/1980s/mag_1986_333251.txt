No labor conflict in recent years ended more dramatically than the collision between Ronald Reagan and the Professional Air Traffic Controllers Organization . Two days after PATCO 's illegal Aug. 3 , 1981 , walkout over pay scales , benefits and working conditions , an angry President ordered the Federal Aviation Administration to fire 11,345 strikers and hire replacements . Only about 500 PATCO members were rehired ; the rest are permanently blackballed . <P> Last week the 13,000 controllers currently on the job were trying to organize . At a founding convention in Chicago , a new organization known as the National Air Traffic Controllers Association announced that it intends to win certification as a bargaining unit . The association declared that it had collected 4,200 signatures , or the 30% of its potential membership necessary to petition for certification , and would be filing the pertinent documents with federal labor-relations authorities within a month . The aspiring union , though , has openly declared that it will not use PATCO 's methods to obtain any future bargaining demands . Said John Thornton , NATCA 's national @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means only . We will work within the system . " By law , federal employees are not allowed to strike or engage in labor slowdowns . Added Thornton : " Our rhetoric will be moderate . We are hopeful of achieving a better working relationship through cooperation instead of confrontation . " <P> The controllers are unhappy , but pay is not a serious grievance . A fully rated controller at a busy airport can make between $45,000 and $60,000 . Even so , says Thornton , " the problems of the past persist : overwork , old equipment , high stress . A union is more necessary than ever . " <P> Controllers , even more than passengers , are feeling the effects of a record summer for domestic travel . NATCA claims that only about 62% of current controllers are fully qualified for all situations compared with about 80% of those employed before the strike . The FAA says 72% of the current controllers are fully qualified . NATCA also complains that many controllers regularly work six-day weeks without relief . Says Thornton : " They also put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Before the strike a controller typically worked a position two hours , then got either a break or a transfer to a less demanding job . Today controllers remain on a busy position up to five hours . " NATCA organizers point to a record 777 reported near misses in the air last year as evidence that the traffic-control system is under severe stress . <P> The FAA , which is required by law to be neutral on the subject of an employees ' union , has refrained from commenting on the NATCA organizing effort .
