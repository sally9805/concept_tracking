SALVADOR by Joan Didion <P> Simon &; Schuster ; 108 pages ; $12.95 <P> Joan Didion 's talent thrives in hot places : Southern California , Hawaii , Mexico and the Central America of her novel A Book of Common Prayer . She finds flowers of evil where most people see posies , and she can fix a place or a character with some of the sharpest prose in contemporary American writing . <P> Didion 's timing is not bad either . Salvador , first published in the New York Review of Books , goes hardback and national just as full attention is turning again to the nation of only 8,260 sq . mi . The book is Didion 's report on two weeks spent in El Salvador during 1982 . Saul Bellow 's To Jerusalem and Back comes to mind . Didion listens to experts on la situatin , and one is reminded of Bellow 's comment after a similar experience in the Middle East : " Such intelligent discussion has n't always been wrong . What is wrong with it is that the discussants invariably impart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , historical studies show that what actually happened was devoid of anything like such intelligence . " <P> Didion finds nothing in El Salvador that would refute this dispiriting wisdom . Everything about the place offends and frightens her . Fear and loathing seem to have been part of her carry-on baggage . At the airport , her papers are checked in " a thicket of automatic weapons . " Cherokee Chiefs , synonymous with family fun in the States , lurk about as the preferred vehicles of death squads that " disappear " people suspected of guerrilla activities or sympathies . She visits the body dumps of El Playon and Puerta del Diablo , where many of the disappeared turn up dead and disfigured . She peeks into the tallies of the weekly " grim-grams " that the U.S. embassy in San Salvador sends to Washington . She discovers that statistics and categories tend to be slippery in this part of the world . <P> In two weeks Didion neither gets nor expects to get to the bottom of who is doing what to whom and why . She is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. policy that would polarize the region into extreme leftists and rightists . But Didion is no pundit . Her strength is in conveying atmosphere and her own sense of horror , although this is not always completely convincing . Seated one night on the porch of a restaurant with her writer husband , John Gregory Dunne , Didion notices a shadowy figure in a truck and a man with a rifle at a gas station . " Nothing came of this , " she says anticlimactically , " but I did not forget the sensation of having been in a single instant demoralized , undone , humiliated by fear , which is what I meant when I said that I came to understand in El Salvador the mechanism of terror . "
