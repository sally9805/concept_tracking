It was less a foreign policy debate than an explosion of name-calling unusually bitter even for a presidential campaign . Unusually misleading , too . Ted Kennedy and Jimmy Carter fought over the credit for a promising idea for release of the U.S. hostages in Tehran , though actually the idea seems to have been mainly the brainchild of U.N . Secretary-General Kurt Waldheim . <P> Kennedy began the row . In a speech at Georgetown University on Jan. 28 , he had proposed an international commission to investigate Iran 's grievances against the U.S. as a quid pro quo for release of the hostages . His suggestion drew little attention , and last week he suddenly sharpened his rhetoric . In a speech at Harvard , Kennedy boomed : " For months , the White House rejected a commission on Iranian grievances-which could have freed the hostages sooner . Now , at last , the President is about to agree to it . But the Administration stubbornly resisted this solution until I and others made the proposal . " <P> An angry White House immediately launched a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " cynical , self-serving , irresponsible and false . " Secretary of State Cyrus Vance accused Kennedy of " misstatements ... both numerous and serious , " and State Department Spokesman Hodding Carter III asserted that Kennedy had got the commission idea from confidential briefings that Vance and Waldheim had given him . Finally , Carter himself said at his press conference that Kennedy 's remarks had been " very damaging to our country . " <P> The germ of the idea actually first appeared in a letter to Waldheim from Abolhassan Banisadr , then Iran 's Foreign Minister . It was published on Nov. 13 , only nine days after the hostages were seized . Banisadr asserted that " the American Government should at least accept the investigation of the guilt of the former Shah . " He did not say who should investigate , but , according to a U.N . spokesman , Waldheim privately broached the idea of an international inquiry commission to U.S. and Iranian officials on Nov. 17 . He pursued it on a year-end trip to Iran and on a visit to Carter in Washington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public in a television interview : It had already been widely discussed in the press . <P> By week 's end Kennedy conceded , quite lamely , that he could not " claim authorship " of the commission proposal and indeed that it had " been around for months " before his Georgetown speech . But he continued to insist that the Administration had rejected the proposal until he began prodding . That appears at best an overstatement . <P> It is true that the Administration long seemed dubious . Though Carter now stresses that the White House has been " discussing " the commission idea with Waldheim " since mid-November , " he indicated serious reservations at a press conference Nov. 28 . And after Carter 's Jan. 6 talk with Waldheim , Powell told reporters that the White House had rejected what was even then being called a package deal-though he insisted the next day that it had not turned the proposal down flat but was still " exploring " it . What the White House objected to then , and still does , was any idea that Iran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
