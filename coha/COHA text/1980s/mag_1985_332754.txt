It seemed such a nice , harmless idea . A Moscow school principal was casting about for a topic to assign as a theme to 300 youngsters ages ten to 13 . He came up with the sturdy standby : " How I Would Like to Live When I Grow Up . " Perhaps there would be evidence that the students had absorbed the aspirations of New Soviet Man , an idealized citizen devoted to the good of society and for whom the Communist Party has searched since 1917 . Only 18 months ago , President Konstantin Chernenko reminded the nation that " the molding of the New Man is an imperative condition in the building of Communism . " Moreover , Moscow Intellectual Fyodor Bulatsky had recently argued that in Soviet society , which is thought to have done away with bourgeois values , it was time to ask what standards to expect of today 's youth . <P> The themes provided some answers . One girl wrote that she would " travel about the country on business . Flowers , Paris , beauty . I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clothes made in the West . I 'd have children , a car and a diplomat husband . I 'd visit Poland , East Germany . . . India . I would n't work ! and I 'd eat like a queen . " A journalist 's son wanted to " travel throughout many different countries ; for instance , it 's nice to interview a ( Salvadoran ) freedom fighter in the shade of a palm tree . " A second boy wrote , " I will be a pilot . . . and then the director of a trust just like Dad . I 'll fly abroad and bring back presents . " Another girl revealed that after she married a biologist , " we 'd buy a piano and sing all day long . We 'd buy a Scottish sheepdog and two cockatoos . " One of her schoolmates shared the happy thought that " I would n't work but I 'd get paid just the same . . . I 'd also like to have lots of different things , dresses for every day of the week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Because clothes make a person slender and more beautiful . " She concluded , " In general I 'd like to live better than the others . " Perhaps the most distant from New Soviet Man were two boys , one of whom noted , " A rich man knows a great deal , can do a lot and has everything : car , flat and country house . A strong man is someone who has useful friends . " His tough-minded chum asserted , " You ca n't get by without friends or connections . " <P> The principal was stunned . So were Moscow officials , who launched an investigation to determine how the children came by these ideological aberrations . The authorities concluded that they had been hearing such talk from their parents . But one embarrassed official admitted to TIME , " It is not a problem just with this school . " Indeed it is not a problem just with the Soviet Union . A Moscow newspaper account sounded not unlike the commentary of U.S. educators , who are increasingly concerned that U.S. students have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concentrate materialistically on career preparation . " If they talk about a profession , " complained the Moscow editorial , " then it 's only a means of getting all kinds of goods . "
