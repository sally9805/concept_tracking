Even Houston must have believed this up to a point . The Astros entertained thoughts of signing free-agent catcher Rich Gedman after he failed to come to terms with Boston . And reports continue to surface that they would trade veteran outfielder Jose Cruz for a shortstop who could play every day. // // Still , most people feel that since manager Hal Lanier did not subtract from his pitching staff , which had the second lowest earned-run average in the NL and the most saves ( 51 ) , the Astros will be very tough to upset . Houston also features that most famous of all baseball coaches , Yogi Berra , who has taken part in 22 World Series - 14 as a player , 2 as a manager , and 6 as a coach. // The Houston pitching staff , which may be exceeded in depth only by that of the defending World Champion New York Mets , numbers among its starters Mike Scott , Bob Knepper , Nolan Ryan , Jim DeShaies , and Danny Darwin. // Scott , the National League ' s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ split-fingered fastball . This is a pitch that looks like a regular fastball to the hitter ( actually appears much like an airplane that is coming in for a landing ) , except that at the last moment the pitch screws itself into the ground. // The truth is , Scott wasn ' t much of a pitcher until current San Francisco manager Roger Craig ( out of baseball at the time ) gave Mike an eight-day crash course in how to throw it in 1984 . Since then Scott has gone from a career high 10 victories to consecutive 18-win seasons . In 33 starts last year , only once did he allow more than three runs . And he was at his best in the critical late action , pitching a no-hitter against the Giants on Sept. 25 in the game that clinched the division title , then overpowering the Mets twice in the playoffs. // Knepper , a veteran left-hander who was considered flighty and inconsistent during his early years with San Francisco ( though he did win 17 games one season ) , began to find himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year he was Houston ' s No. 2 winner with a 17-12 record. // If you need to be introduced to Nolan Ryan , who has five no-hitters among his 241 major league victories , then evidently you have been vacationing on Gilligan ' s Island . Even though at age 40 Ryan now needs that extra day of rest between starts , he can still make a baseball look like an M &; M candy to most hitters . Nolan is , of course , the major leagues ' all-time strikeout king , and he added 194 to his total last year while compiling a 12-8 won-lost mark. // DeShaies also won 12 games last year as a rookie , setting a major league record in one of them by striking out eight consecutive Los Angeles batters . The hard-throwing southpaw may not get any faster , but he could be even tougher as he gains more experience. // Darwin , who had three years with the Texas Rangers at the beginning of the 1980s when he went 32-21 , was 5-2 with the Astros after a late-season trade with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brewers. // But this rotation is just part of Houston ' s strength on the mound . Another department that all rival National League managers look upon with wonderment ( yes , even the Mets ' Davey Johnson ) is Lanier ' s bullpen . It produced a league-leading 51 saves , including 33 by right-hander Dave Smith , who could probably shut the door on King Kong. // The other two dependables in the Astros ' bullpen are Charlie Kerfeld and Aurelio Lopez. // Kerfeld , a certified , genuine , honest-to-goodess character who isn ' t afraid to challenge the hitters , often runs his mouth more than his legs . Depending on what day of the week it is and what kind of mood he ' s in , Kerfeld will sell you one of his ' ' Bermuda Triangle Search and Rescue Team ' ' T-shirts for either $25 or $50. // The son of a cook - and apparently a good one - Charlie ( now a relatively slim , for him , 245 ) once weighed 280 pounds . But he appeared in the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , won 11 , saved seven , and struck out almost twice as many hitters as he walked. // Although Lopez , who is almost as old as Ryan , also saved seven games last year , he consistently finishes a distant third in the publicity department behind Smith and Kerfeld . But his smarts are well known to opposing hitters , and he can rely on the experience of a dozen years in the Mexican League and 10 more in the majors , mostly with Detroit. // While pitching to Houston is not exactly like pitching to the power-heavy New York Mets ( who outscored the Astros 783-654 last season ) , Lanier has a lot of tough outs in his lineup. // Chief among them is first baseman Glenn Davis , the first Astro to hit more than 30 home runs since Jimmy Wynn logged 33 in 1969 . Davis finished with 31 , also drove in 101 runs , and was runner-up to Philadelphia ' s Mike Schmidt as the National League ' s Most Valuable Player . Runs-batted-in power in the 70s was provided by outfielders Jose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hits with 184 . Third baseman Denny Walling was also a solid contributor with 58 RBIs. // In the field , Bill Doran turns the double play as well as any second baseman in the league , while center fielder Billy Hatcher , a late-season acquisition from the Chicago Cubs , tightens the outer defenses. // Even though Lanier platooned at shortstop with Craig Reynolds and Dickie Thon and still won the NL West , he would still prefer someone who could handle this position on an everyday basis . Yet any trade the Astros could make for a shortstop answering that description would almost certainly cost them one of their best young pitchers. // Catcher Alan Ashby , who gets his name in the paper only on slow news days , is a much better player than his statistics might indicate. // Can Houston repeat in the NL West ? It will probably depend on two things : ( 1 ) How much the Cincinnati Reds have improved their pitching , and ( 2 ) how close the Astros can come to duplicating last season ' s excellent all-around performance. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
