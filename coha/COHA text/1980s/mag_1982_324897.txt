TIME 'S Eastern European Bureau Chief Richard Hornik spent the first ten days of Poland 's state of emergency in Gdansk and Warsaw , operating as best he could under a communications blackout , tight censorship and restrictions on travel . Last week he flew from Warsaw to Paris , where he wrote this firsthand account of life under General Jaruzelski ' s martial-law regime . His report : <P> <P> " They should know that we can not be beaten , " said a 30-year-old Pole . " It may take three or five years , but we will be back . " That sort of spirit has made it impossible to " beat " the Poles for centuries . But in a way it has also kept the Poles from achieving victory . <P> What really galls the Poles this time is that they have defeated themselves-temporarily , of course . The nation that secretly derided the people of Czechoslovakia for offering no resistance in 1968 must now admit that it has not lived up to that brave slogan so often heard since August 1980 : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on your knees . " <P> And whereas it took five Warsaw Pact armies to end the Prague Spring , the Polish August was frozen by the pride of the nation , by the sons and brothers of Solidarity members . The Polish army was the last official institution with any popular trust . That is finished now . Even the cowed population of Warsaw openly shows its hatred . Obscene gestures are made at passing armored columns . The Poles have taken the acronym of the ruling military council WRON , and added an A to produce WRONA , crow in Polish . " Crow " was what Poles called the Gestapo during the Nazi occupation , after the stylized eagle on the Gestapo emblem . Silhouettes of crows are popping up around Warsaw , and swastikas are being drawn on the frosty windows of the capital 's overcrowded buses . <P> Most of the young conscripts who stand guard at every significant intersection in Warsaw attempt to be pleasant . They seem overjoyed when an occasional passer-by stops to chat as they stand next to their coal-fired braziers warming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coldest and snowiest Decembers in years . But they are easily angered when people mutter that " all the coal goes to the army . " <P> Is the army strong enough ? The consensus in Warsaw : not for the long haul . In physical terms , the army and the other security forces are stretched to the limit . Said one Western diplomat , " There is not one unit or piece of equipment in reserve . " Most soldiers are on 18-hr , shifts . The army is not being used to suppress strikes or break up demonstrations . A tank may be used to burst through a factory gate or fire a warning shot , but it is the militia ( police ) who are left to do the dirty work . <P> Thus far that has been sufficient . Most of Poland is calm . There are trouble spots , but the WRON can wait out or starve out that resistance . Quiet does not mean that the military takeover has succeeded , however , for the security forces have no weapons against the growing passive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " You can put a colonel in every shoe factory in the country , but that will not stop the decline in production . "
