 | Conclusion . England ? and the world greeted the news of the engagement of Lady Diana Spencer to Prince Charles with a great outburst of joy . It was the first unarranged marriage by a Prince of Wales in history , and the Princess-to-he was not afraid to proclaim to the world that it was a love match , even if her fiance was more equivocal ? " Whatever in love ' means , " he said . The brief interview in which they describes their courtship and plans for the future was replayed so frequently on television that viewers almost knew it by heart ? " With Prince Charles beside me I ca n't go wrong , " said Lady Diana . It was a @#  | spontaneous and memorable moment of celebration . The euphoria was in part a tribute to the character of the girl who would one day be Queen . Lady Diana Spencer was welcomed by a world grown sick of rebels and now delighted to discover that the qualities of moderation and common sense , so generally admired in the royal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of someone so young and so pretty and so eminently balanced . The arrival of the bride-to-he 's father , the Earl Spencer , in the crowds outside Buckingham Palace on the engagement day lent an added touch to the general jubilation . The television interviewers could scarcely conceal their astonishment . " What are you doing outside the Palace ? " they asked . " Posing for the photographers , " replied the Earl happily . Brandishing his own camera , he explained that he had taken pictures of all the other great occasions in his daughter 's life , and that he was not missing out on this one . In an interview the Earl even revealed that Prince Charles had formally asked him for permission to marry Diana ? " I do n't know what he 'd have said if I 'd turned him down . " It was all enormous fun . The hope and curiosity of the crowds of cameramen who had besieged Lady Diana for months had become legitimate . She now belonged to the nation , and the nation prepared with her to thoroughly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 29 . David and Elizabeth Emanuel started designing the wedding dress in the spring of 1981 , when the shooting of President Reagan was fresh in everyone 's mind . So they felt they had to ask whether their creation should he constructed around a bulletproof vest . Buckingham Palace had never heard of such a thing . The second step for the two @# 9.  | designers was to hire 24-hour security guards and to install a safe . The couple found their wastebins were vanishing mysteriously . So : having decided upon an ivory creation , they made sure that all the snippings that went out with the rubbish were plain white . Scraps from the real dress were all religiously burned at the end of each day . One paper published a story that the Emanuels were , in fact , producing three wedding dresses , so that if one were stolen or pirated , another could take its place . Shops in England broke out in a rash of souvenirs ? beer , biscuits , tea containers , and T-shirts could be purchased bearing the image of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty amazing " when she met him , and now this catchphrase , as well as her sayings on other matters , were avidly collected : " I love working with children , and I have learned to be very patient with them . " ; Her comment on life inside Buckingham Palace : " Not bad . But too many formal dinners ( yuk ! ) . " She was a craze . Her hairstyle was immediately copied . A @#  | British magazine ran a feature to show how ordinary girls could make themselves look more like her , and several national newspapers ran Lady Di lookalike competitions . Down in Australia , where the Prince of Wales was on tour , one reporter made another interesting observation . The Prince seemed nervous , miserable even . He had been publicly engaged for nearly two months and his fiancee had been so unreserved as to cry when she said good-bye to him at London Airport , in noticeable contrast to the nonchalance with which the Prince had walked up the boarding steps . Prince Charles had not previously betrayed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day , " Whatever ' in love ' means , " was right in line with his previous declarations on the subject of marriage . " If I 'm deciding on whom I want to live with for fifty years , " he had said in 1972 , " well , that 's the last decision on which I would want my head to be ruled by my heart . " And at the beginning of the engagement he had seemed to have embarked upon the enterprise with one pair of fingers firmly crossed , hoping that love would flourish in conditions that appeared to be very promising . Love , it seemed , started to flourish in Australia . Every day the papers were full of the Princess-to-be , the smart clothes she had worn , the funny things she had said , her style . her magic . " Lady Di " was the subject of everyone 's first question to him . " Suddenly he seemed to realize , " says one reporter traveling with him in Australia , " that he had got himself a winner . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grow fonder . He fell in love with Diana just like Joe Public . " July 29 , 1981 . The bride emerged from her carriage like a butterfly breaking out of its chrysalis , and her bridesmaids hurried round Lady Diana , straightening out the acres of crushed ivory silk taffeta and lace embroidered with mother-of-pearl sequins and pearls . Her appearance as she walked up the steps of St. Paul 's Cathedral drew cheers from the crowd . Then it was time for the bride to start her procession down the aisle on the arm of her father , the Earl Spencer . Her prince stood waiting for her beneath the great arch of the cathedral dome . " Dearly beloved , " intoned the Dean of St. Paul 's , and the marriage service had begun . It was relayed by loudspeakers to the crowds outside . Diana muddled up her husband 's names and he , by mistake , left out the word " worldly " and promised to share all her goods with her . " I pronounce that they be man and wife together , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was now the Princess of Wales . Outside Buckingham Palace the crowds cheered . Settling down in her open carriage outside the cathedral she felt , or perhaps she allowed herself to feel , for the first time , the full warmth of the crowd 's adoration and she raised both her hands in the air to wave . Then she remembered herself . The British Broadcasting Company ( BBC2 ) had devoted the day to a presentation of the festivities . with subtitles for deaf viewers , some of whom claimed to have lip-read what the Princess said to her husband as they stood together side by side on the palace balcony . She : " They want us to kiss . " He : " Why not ? " So she kissed him . Everyone admired the new Princess 's jaunty going-away outfit , in cantaloupe silk , and the sharp-eyed noticed that she was now wearing the same sixstrand pearl choker that her sister , Sarah , had been wearing at the cathedral ? and that her sister went home bare necked . The expectation had been that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down a bit . It scarcely seemed possible that Lady Di fever could be sustained . But when she got back from her honeymoon ( a cruise in the Aegean on the royal yacht . Britannia ) , it became plain that the condition was terminal . Back in Balmoral the siege by the press was resumed with more intensity than ever . Within days it became evident that some compromise must be reached ? a full-scale photo session was granted in return for a little peace and quiet . So on Wednesday , August 19 , 1981 , the Prince and Princess , he in a kilt , she in a somewhat longer skirt , posed happily on the banks of the Dee for photographers . Princess Diana 's great triumph came in Wales . Any pretty ymong bride should charm the world on her wedding day . But it was a more formidable proposition for a coltish scion of the English aristocracy to cast her enchantment over Wales , the home of working-class heroes , where unemployment at the end of October 1981 , the moment of hetour , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Go home English Princess ' was their slogan . It was , to use one of her favored phrases , " a great challenge " ? and she rose to it magnificently . Welsh television stations broadcast the tour live all day . But it seemed that most of the Welsh wanted to come out and look her over for themselves . despite the rain . Choirs of children waited for hours in the cold to serenade her , and when they gave full throat to the anthem " God Bless the Prince of Wales , " they added a new last line . " God bless the Princess too . " So much of Diana 's princessly magic derives from her visual image . She looks like a princess ? groomed , elegant . and clad in garments that are familiar to any woman but that , somehow , have been dusted with an extra glamour : and in an age where fortuneare made and lost by the " look " of . product . this is a happy gift . She likes wearing good clothes ? and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Princess of Wales in London is a triplex apartment around a courtyard in Kensington Palace . Her neighbors are two sets of her husband 's cousins ? the Duke and Duchess of Gloucester and Prince and Princess Michael of Kent ? and his aunt , Princess Margaret . The private rooms are in modern style , while the rooms in which the couple will entertain are more traditional . There is a floor of offices to accommodate the private secretaries , his aides . and her ladies-in-waiting : and staff and domestic quarters . Just north of the front door , beyond the garages , is a helicopter pad . There is another helicopter pad down at the Prince and Princess 's country home . Highgrove , in Gloucestershire . The house is clearly visible from the road , and a footpath runs right along one low wall , to the delight of photographers with long-focus lenses . It evidently did not occur to Prince Charles when he bought the house in the summer of 1980 , that if he wanted to kiss his wife on the front doorstep or dance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recorded on film . And so photographers began another siege of the Princess of Wales when she moved into Highgrove in the autumn of 1981 . It was while the couple was in Scotland that the strain of the media 's constant attention started to tell . No remedy was available to the Princess ? but she did have powerful allies . Prince Philip 's eyes would light up at the sight of her . He would really sparkle in her presence . And Diana had already established a close and warm relationship with her mother-in-law , the Queen . If Diana had any problem she would go  | straight to the Queen , tell her all about it , and they 'd have a jolly good chat . Consequently , British editors were summoned to Buckingham Palace on December 8 . There the Queen told them that the new Princess , now bearing a potential heir to the British throne , was feeling the strain . Next day newspaper editorials preached a common line : There would be more temperance , less intrusion , fewer long lenses tracking her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was triggered by the news that her daughter-in-law was expecting a baby , and the public announcement of the Princess 's pregnancy on November 5 , 1981 , played a major part in producing the reverence with which the royal plea was heard . It was not strictly necessary for the Prince and Princess of Wales to have children to assure the succession to the British throne . Succession is more than assured by several football teams of designated heirs , starting with the Princes Andrew and Edward . But Britain and the world would have felt something was amiss if Charles and Diana had not , of their own flesh and blood , created life to succeed them . The new mother-to-be gave every sign of finding her pregnancy exactly what she wanted for herself . She could not wait to dress up in maternity clothes , and she took to wearing them long before it was strictly necessary . The royal event provided , as usual . the opportunity to elevate a routine domestic phenomenon into a national discussion . Pregnancy tips and maternity wear began to appear in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinking they were not what their readers wanted . One newspaper writer lamented the end of the summer fairy tale . Romance had changed too quickly to dynastic history for her taste , and she made some sharp points about the example this set to other young women , encouraging them to rush into motherhood before they had fully enjoyed and explored themselves as individuals or as marriage partners . Other young women did not seem to agree . In a poll , young married women getting off buses in London said that they would just love to stop work and have lots of babies if only they could afford it and had a couple of nursery maids to help . But the larger point remained . Lady Di had vanished too soon . She had been an individual for a few months , an enticing personality in her own right . With her marriage she had become one of a pair , and now she was about to submerge herself in a family . While sharing in her obvious happiness , some people felt a little cheated . Was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two British newspapers felt their readers required photographic reassurance that the mother-to-be , sunning her tummy in the supposed seclusion of a Bahamas beach , could still provide a royal pinup . Few of their readers ever doubted it . The Princess 's weaknesses are also her strengths . People love her for her anxieties and vulnerabilities. her tendency to speak before she thinks . " What a long time to sit ! " she exclaimed after her first official engagement . " I 've got pins and needles in my bottom . " " Like a piece of unseasoned natural wood , " wrote a women 's magazine in April 1981 . " She is ready to be fashioned into a stately and polished figurehead . " Let us hope that they are wrong . It is her lack of pomposity which is so refreshing , the fact that she clearly has to steel herself for many of her new public tasks , and that beneath her recent dignity she is still , in essence , just a kid . Yet the Princess can be tough enough when the occasion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot does not mean that she lacks the ability to get exactly what she wants . In love with Prince Charles , she succeeded where girls who were much older and more liberated ? and had more education ? all failed . She has also managed to create a private relationship with one of the world 's most public men . The effect on Prince Charles has been dramatic . Lost in his bachelorhood , he was rather closer to 40 in character than in years . Compared to other British men in their early thirties . his style was quite sedate ? and behind his public image as a devil-may-care Lothario was a solitary and sometimes almost forlorn character , who confided in his valet and who spent a surprising number of evenings having dinner on his own at home . Today Prince Charles is transparently a happy man , at ease with himself . In the autumn of 1981 he and his new wife were to be seen walking the corridors of Buckingham Palace hand in hand . In private , friends report that they cling to each other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to prise apart . Free to choose , they would clearly much prefer to be left in a corner to exchange their own gentle gossip and private endearments . Princess Diana has spread this happiness widely . In less than a year this girl has become part of every British family . the relative everyone knows , loves , and gossips about fondly , even if she never actually comes to call ? an emblem and mascot that is fiercely cherished . Young , beautiful , married to a prince . and now enjoying all the comforts and privileges that accompany the life-style of royalty , she could easily become the object of envy . Instead she generates love , admiration , and a very warm glow . It makes for an enchanting transformation when you are the one plucked out of millions to dance at the ball . The glass slipper was missing , but the youngest sister from a broken home did get the gown , the glass coach , and , of course , the charming prince . The wand was waved by us because we want her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fantasies . It is important to us that the magic does not die ? and that is why we have a special reason for hoping that Diana . Her Royal Highness the Princess of Wales , may truly live happily ever after . @# Around dawn on June 21st , 10 days before their baby was expected , the Prince and Princess of Wales left their Kensington Palace apartment and drove through the streets of London to St. Mary 's Hospital , Paddington . Soon the news was out : Diana had been admitted to the hospital in the early stages of labor . Then more than 15 hours passed before the announcement was made : " Her Royal Highness , the Princess of Wales was safely delivered of a son at 9:03 P.M. today . " Prince Charles remained at his wife 's bedside throughout the long labor , and the birth was natural , or " very nearly , " he said later . The future king weighed seven pounds , one-and-a-half ounces and came into the world crying lustily . Less than 24 hours after his arrival Diana @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little prince home . The following Monday the royal couple ended a week of speculation by disclosing that they were naming the baby William . Though born to the purple ? officially he will be christened William Arthur Philip Louis and will be known as Prince William of Wales ? most people agree with Diana 's father , Earl Spencer , when he said . " The baby is lucky to have Diana as a mother . "
