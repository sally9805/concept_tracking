So says Reagan of a bid to relocate the U.S. embassy in Israel <P> The U.S. maintains 136 embassies around the world , 135 of them in foreign capital cities . The odd nation out : Israel . Jerusalem is the capital , but the American embassy has always been in Tel Aviv , 40 miles northwest , a safe diplomatic distance from the divisive international disputes concerning the status of the Holy City . Now , however , momentum is gathering in Congress for a politically motivated , election-year bill that would require the State Department to move its Tel Aviv embassy to Jerusalem . Last week President Ronald Reagan ventured into this tangled debate with an oblique threat to veto the measure . Said he : " Like the several Presidents before me , I think that that is a most unwise thing . " <P> By heritage and geography , Jerusalem is like no other place in the world . For Jews and many Christians , it is the holiest city ; for Muslims , only Mecca and Medina , both in Saudi Arabia , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been the focus of national and religious wars , from the Roman conquest to the Crusades to the struggle between Arab and Jewish communities during the British mandate of 1919-48 . Israel established its modern capital in the western part of the divided city in 1950 , two years after the country 's founding . During the Six-Day War of 1967 , it seized from Jordan the ancient Arab eastern part of the city , which includes the principal religious shrines ; four years ago , in a move that was extremely provocative to Arabs and Muslims , the Israelis declared the city reunified as the country 's capital . <P> To American supporters of the U.S. relocation , it is a simple matter of recognizing a 35-year-old fact . Says Democrat Tom Lantos of California , a sponsor of the bill in the House : " It merely faces up to the reality that West Jerusalem is the seat of government of Israel and the place where the U.S. in fact conducts its diplomatic relations with Israel . " What it also faces up to-blatantly but effectively-is the desire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which favors the move almost unanimously as a symbolic show of U.S. support for Israel . Both Walter Mondale and Gary Hart demonstrated as much in New York , where they sought to outdo each other in supporting the idea while campaigning for the large Jewish vote in that state 's primary . In fact , the embassy question is generating much more heat in the U.S. than in Israel , where it is not a prominent political concern at the moment . Israeli leaders are somewhat bemused by the gamesmanship of U.S. politicians and anxious to avoid the swirl of American electoral politics .
