Louis R. Nickinello , 42 , small businessman , former Natick public works commissioner and ex-state representative , arrived at 7:20 a.m. yesterday to spend his first day running the Massachusetts Port Authority . Despite his tenuous position as Massport ' s executive director , Nickinello was upbeat , smiling and relaxed at morning and afternoon press conferences , though he would not discuss the legal tangles that place the makeup of the Massport board and his $75,000 job in doubt . He was " here to work and listen , " he said in the morning . In the afternoon he introduced his administrative assistant , Denise Fazio , brought over from the State House , and said he had spent the day talking to department heads . The security of Nickinello ' s appointment was cast in doubt late Friday when newly installed Gov . Michael S. Dukakis announced he was removing two men named to the Massport board at the last moment by former governor Edward J. King . But Nickinello told reporters yesterday that he gets along well with the new governor , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fires , not the chief executive . The former chairman of the Legislature ' s Transportation Committee now is in charge of Logan International Airport , the Mystic-Tobin Bridge , the seaport , the Boston Fish Pier and 725 employees . The agency has $120 million in revenue a year . Board members who opposed Nickinello ' s appointment said that under the best of conditions - which these are not - Nickinello would be facing a tough challenge . " The problem is simply this , " said board Chairman Robert M. Weinberg , a Dukakis appointee who voted against him , late last week . " Lou is not a bad fellow , but he has never run anything of this scale in his life . The second he comes in the door , he will be facing extraordinary hostility from a broad range of constituencies impacted by our operations . " His supporters on the board noted that Nickinello has one major asset , however - his considerable political skill . Board member John W. Arata , a King appointee who did not at first support Nickinello but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think that one of the pluses of the appointment of Lou Nickinello is that it creates a reasonable hope that we will have a cooperative Legislature and not a hostile one . " Among the problems confronting Nickinello is the hostility of groups such as the Massport Community Advisory Committee , whose members recall that as a legislator he wanted to let the noisy supersonic Concorde land at Logan , opposed night towing of planes to reduce noise and , like King , favored the third harbor tunnel . In addition , some members of Massport ' s search advisory committee , irate at having their counsel ignored ( they wanted former Environmental Affairs Secretary Evelyn Murphy ) , have said they will form a new watchdog group to monitor Massport . Nickinello will also have to deal with the so-called King agenda , including construction of new runways and runway extensions at Logan , very unpopular in East Boston . There is also the agenda left over from former Massport director Davis W. Davis , who was fired when King ' s appointees gained control of the board last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ project at Logan , only the first stage of which is under way ; the $100 million East Boston Piers redevelopment project , planned in partnership with the city ; the $85 million Boscom high-tech center at Commonwealth Pier . In addition , Nickinello will have to deal with those in the business community who look askance at his lack of experience . In addition , much of the Massport staff is still loyal to Davis . On the board itself , the three Dukakis appointees - Weinberg , Arthur Gelb and John Vitagliano - are not happy about their new employee . They remember that as House transportation chairman , he opposed some of their policies.Because of the last-minute switches , he has only two board members , E. Paul Robsham and Arata , who actually voted to appoint him . Some contend that if Nickinello is able to hold onto the job , he may surprise his detractors . " What people don ' t focus on is that Lou won ' t roll over and take orders from the King people , " said a source close to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ director . " He comes to Massport with his own agenda and he knows who was trying to do him in ( during the search* . " Nickinello apparently bears no resentment for the rough and sometimes demeaning ordeal he went through in the two-month search process . " I ' m a big boy , " he said in a telephone interview , " I ' m not personally hurt . I ' m used to the political arena . "
