Protestants and Catholics are thriving in the " Hermit Kingdom " <P> " Is it not a joy indeed to have a friend come from afar ? " Gracefully quoting those words from Confucius , Pope John Paul II last week began a five-day visit to South Korea , * a land where exuberant Christianity today all but overshadows Confucianism . The welcoming ceremony for the Pontiff was sedate , since Seoul 's airport had been swept virtually clean of onlookers . Extraordinary security preparations , caused in part by assassination threats , were everywhere evident-and perhaps necessary . Sunday morning , three days after his arrival , the Pope was en route to Seoul 's Myong Dong Cathedral when a deranged-looking young man dashed out from the crowd and , assuming a shooter 's crouch about 35 ft. from John Paul 's bulletproof car , brandished what looked like a handgun . An alert policeman fired one shot into the roadway in front of the man , who threw his " weapon " to the ground ; it proved to be a plastic toy . The man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away . <P> Before the incident , the crowds greeting the Pontiff in cities like Taegu and Pusan as well as Seoul were large and enthusiastic . At Kwangju , site of an antigovernment protest in which at least 183 people died , the Pope was greeted by thunderous applause and cheers from 70,000 who had gathered for a stadium Mass . In his address , John Paul spoke of those " haunted by the memory of the unfortunate events of this place . " Throughout his trip , and even during a private meeting with President Chun Doo-Hwan , John Paul pointedly appealed for human rights and the dignity of workers . <P> But his major mission was to acknowledge one of Christianity 's most strategic centers in Asia and to celebrate the 200th anniversary of Roman Catholicism in Korea . The influence of Christian churches in South Korea was evident on Sunday when , right after the " shooting " scare , the Pope presided over rites canonizing 103 martyrs , the first such group ceremony outside of Rome . The new saints were killed under 19th century monarchs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tiny , alien sect . The site of the canonization Mass , Seoul 's Yoido Plaza , is usually reserved for the May 8 observance of Buddha 's birthday . But since the Catholics ' ten-story cross and shell-shaped altar were too monumental to be dismantled in time , the Buddhists agreed to step aside . <P> Few nations are being Christianized more rapidly than South Korea . At the end of World War II , only about 5% of South Koreans were Christians . Today the figure is at least 20% of the country 's 40 million population , a higher percentage than any other Asian country 's except the Philippines ' 83.5% . An estimated 16% of South Koreans are Buddhist , and 13% are Confucianist . Millions retain some adherence to various forms of shamanism , a primitive folk religion .
