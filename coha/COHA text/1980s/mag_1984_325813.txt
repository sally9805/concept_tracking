Cuba offers terms for an Angola pullout <P> Ever since the Reagan Administration began its behind-the-scenes diplomatic efforts in 1981 to secure independence for the predominantly black , , South Africa-controlled territory of South West Africa , or Namibia , it has insisted on one key condition : the withdrawal of some 25,000 Cuban troops from neighboring Angola . Last month representatives of the South African and Angolan governments negotiated a historic cease-fire in the smoldering , nearly 18-year-old war along the Angola-Namibia border . This raised new hopes for a breakthrough in the long-stalled negotiations over Namibia . Then last week in Havana , Angola 's Marxist President , Jos Eduardo dos Santos , and Cuba 's President , Fidel Castro , unexpectedly issued a joint communiqu setting forth terms for a withdrawal of Cuban troops from Angola . <P> Though couched in stinging , anti-South African rhetoric , the statement was the strongest signal to date that Castro may be ready to comply with U.S. and South African demands to pull out of Southern Africa . The three major Angolan-Cuban conditions : <P> &gt; A withdrawal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they have been waging hit-and-run offensives against the Marxist-oriented guerrillas of the South West Africa People 's Organization ( SWAPO ) , Namibia 's black liberation movement . <P> &gt; South African acceptance of U.N . resolutions calling for withdrawal of South African Defense Forces from Namibia and full independence for the territory . <P> &gt; An end to South African hostilities against the Angolan government and to Pretoria 's support for the antigovernment forces of Jonas Savimbi 's National Union for the Total Independence of Angola ( UNITA ) . " The governments of Cuba and Angola , " the communiqu went on , " reiterate that they shall restart , on their own decision and exercising their sovereignty , the implementation of the gradual withdrawal of Cuban troops as soon as the conditions are met . " <P> Irked by references to the " disgraceful " and " repugnant " Pretoria regime , South African Foreign Minister Roelof ( " Pik " ) Botha denounced the language of the Havana statement as " unacceptable . " Nonetheless , despite the feverish rhetoric , U.S. officials were hopeful . Declared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Angolan-Cuban talks is progress toward Cuban troop withdrawal , I think that 's positive . " <P> Daunting obstacles remain before the Cubans go home . Pretoria is sure to demand ironclad guarantees of a Cuban withdrawal before its own troops leave Namibia . Still , the cease-fire between South Africa and Angola has held , and even South African officials have been impressed by the Angolan determination to end the border war . In recent weeks , troops from both countries have combined forces in a Joint Monitoring Commission ( JMC ) , which has been forced to engage disruptive SWAPO forces on three separate occasions . The JMC toll : two killed and eight wounded , all Angolan . The fact that the Dos Santos government has been willing to let its soldiers fight against SWAPO , once its trusted ally , indicates how seriously it takes its new truce with South Africa .
