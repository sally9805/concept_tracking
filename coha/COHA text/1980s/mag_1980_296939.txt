Special care for Chip Carter <P> In a small bar in Mexico Beach , Fla. , Jimmy Carter 's eldest son Chip was drinking beer with several other young men on the afternoon of July 20 , 1977 . His companions included the skipper of the Foxy Lady , a drab work boat that Carter , who was vacationing that month with then Wife Caron and Son James at her family 's house near Panama City , had chartered on several occasions . Indeed , Carter was arranging with the owner to use the Foxy Lady for a fishing trip with 20 or so friends . <P> Unknown to Chip Carter , now 30 , law enforcement officials were getting ready to stage a major drug bust in the Panama City vicinity that very night . Because of its isolated beaches , tree-lined inlets and intricate inland canal system , the resort area had become an important entry point for marijuana smuggled from Colombia . <P> From an informant , U.S. Customs Service officials had learned that as much as four tons of high-grade Colombian marijuana was due @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and would be sent ashore in smaller boats . Elaborate plans were laid to catch the smugglers in the act . Planes of the Customs Service were to circle overhead , shining powerful spotlights on the scene below . Patrol boats would be cruising near each of the three suspected drug transfer sites . Hidden on shore would be heavily armed local , state and federal officers . <P> But then Customs officials suddenly learned that Chip Carter was drinking beer with the owner of the Foxy Lady . Not only was the boat to be used in the smuggling , but the owner had tipped off the law about the operation . Authorities suspected that several of the young men in the bar might also take part in the smuggling . Officials then and today have no indication that Chip knew anything about the illegal activities of his drinking buddies . Nonetheless , until now , the tale of his possible entanglement in a drug bust has been carefully hushed up , chiefly to save his father from embarrassment . <P> TIME has learned that the Customs officials ' initial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Service escorts and call off the operation . The officials thus informed the Secret Service only that a major drug raid was planned soon and that they should take special care not to let Chip out of their sight . Customs officials told the agents nothing about the expected involvement of the Foxy Lady and her owner . <P> Two Secret Service agents went to the office of Larry Chambers , then Customs patrol supervisor for the area , to find out about the raid . They mentioned that Chip would soon be going fishing aboard the Foxy Lady . Chambers recalled last week that he nearly fell out of his chair when he heard the news . " Jesus Christ ! " he exclaimed , " That 's a boat that is going to be seized in the dope bust . " According to Chambers , one of the agents replied , " My God ! Chip is out right now drinking beer with the owner and some other young guys . "                  @ @ @
