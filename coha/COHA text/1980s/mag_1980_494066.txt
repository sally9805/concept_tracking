Protectionism for the World Car . The Two Faces of Ford Cape Canaveral When Ford Motor Company decided to hold its annual year-end press conference at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida , the affair was expected to be an hour of triumph . The National Aeronautics and Space Administration had set December 4 as the date for the launch of the most powerful communications satellite in history , built by Ford 's aerospace subsidiary . What better way to illustrate Ford 's imagination , engineering superiority , and commitment to technological progress ? What better way to polish the image of a corporation tarnished by huge financial losses , million-dollar lawsuits arising out of dangerously defective Ford products , and an embarrassing inability to fend off a competitive challenge from Japan ? So the invitations went out to hundreds of journalists all over the world to come and witness Ford 's ascent into the heavens . And it would n't cost them or their employers a cent : Ford would provide air fare , hotel accommodations , meals , even a free pair of Bushnell binoculars with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4 , nearly 200 reporters , some of them with photographers and cameramen in tow , descended upon Cocoa Beach to enjoy the hospitality of the nation 's second-biggest auto maker . Most of them were from the US , but 60 or so hailed from Africa , Asia , Europe , and Latin America ? places where Ford cars are as well known as at home . The reporters were provided a hearty lunch at the Holiday Inn , given the chance to hear and question the chairman of Ford and the president of its aerospace subsidiary , and escorted through an afternoon tour of the space center . Finally , as night fell , they were loaded onto buses , driven across the bridge to Cape Canaveral , and deposited only a few hundred yards away from the launch pad , where a huge white rocket , gleaming in the floodlights , stood waiting to be catapulted into the sky . But Ford 's triumph was not to be . After one postponement and more than an hour of waiting , NASA announced that because of a minor mechanical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next evening and possibly longer . So the assembled members of the press were loaded back onto the buses and transported back to the Holiday Inn for a cocktail party and a gloomy evening of drinking , accompanied by a vaguely Hawaiian musical troupe . Most of the journalists left the next day , as originally planned , and only a handful hung around until Saturday evening , when the launch finally took place . Ford 's executives may be forgiven for any doubts they have about the existence of a just God . Certainly the company is long overdue for a triumph , having had hardly anything but setbacks in the last three years . Last year Ford lost a quarter of a billion dollars , and this year its losses on North American car and truck sales will exceed a billion and a half dollars . The company is living under the threat of being ordered to recall 16 million vehicles to repair an alleged defect which causes the transmission to slip from park to reverse . Ford already has lost several lawsuits over injuries and deaths caused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ victim was awarded $4.4 million in compensatory and punitive damages . If the recall is ordered by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration , it would be the biggest and most expensive recall ever , with a price tag of as high as $000 million . Coming on the heels of the highly publicized scandal involving Ford 's knowing failure to fix a defect in the gas tanks of its Pinto line , the recall also might badly damage Ford 's reputation among con- sumers . The question reporters at Cape Canaveral asked each other , though , was why a corporation losing billions of dollars would throw away good money to entertain and impress the news media . Until this year , the annual press conference had been held in Detroit , with somewhat less fanfare . Certainly there is nothing in your introductory economics textbook to explain the incongruity . Ford is no Chrysler , but there is a genuine chance that it too could be forced to the brink of bankruptcy , and not in the distant future . By all logic the company should be ruthlessly eliminating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to future success . Certainly wining and dining reporters should be high on the cut list . Judged by conventional economic logic , the whole self-promoting conclave makes no sense . What they do n't tell you in Economics 1 , however , is that once the modern corporation reaches late middle age , it becomes as much a political institution as an economic one . It serves several purposes deemed useful by the state providing jobs , protecting national prestige , helping to maintain a healthy trade balance , and of course even doing direct government contracting . The corporation is also expected to further other government objectives that it may not find all that appealing , such as providing investment in depressed areas and hiring minority employees , but in exchange it is assured that the government will take some interest in its prosperity and , as with Lockheed and Chrysler , its survival . Many companies , of course , find it possible to thrive by concentrating their resources on satisfying their customers , as the economics texts say they are supposed to . But many , unable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ competition , prefer to devote a lot of their attention to manipulating government pol- icies for their own benefit . Ford is a good example of this phenomenon . For most of its history , the company had defended the principle of free trade , choosing to take its chances in the competitive arena rather than rely on government solicitude . But that position turned out to be expendable as soon as Ford stopped winning the competition . Ever since the 1979 gasoline shortage struck , causing a devastating shift in consumer demand for American auto makers , Ford has been insisting that the government take steps to keep out imports from Japan . Chrysler , American Motors , and the United Auto Workers all have echoed the demand ; only General Motors , the healthiest of the group , has resisted the temptation . F ORD HAS missed no opportunities to argue its case for protectionism . " The Japanese producers ... have taken a windfall advantage of the abrupt market shift by massively stepping up exports to the US , " the company said in a petition for relief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an unacceptable imbalance in trade and jobs between two of the world 's most important trading partners . " To defuse the suspicion that Ford is only looking to save its own skin , company chairman Philip Caldwell frequently argues that the entire country is threatened by the surge in imported cars . " When we allow our basic industries , including autos , steel , alum- inum , rubber , and glass , to be weakened by unequal foreign competition ? or by shortsighted-domestic policies ? we are endangering our US security capability , " Caldwell warned in a recent speech . Unfortunately for Ford , neither the Carter administration nor the International Trade Commission has been persuaded . Carter has refused to request protectionist laws from Congress or to ask the Japanese to reduce their exports voluntarily , " and the ITC has concluded that the US industry 's problems were caused less by the Japanese than by the shift in consumer demand ( which spurred sales of small American cars as well as imports ) and by the recession . Ford 's plea for protection in its home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of free trade , but also with its latest advertising theme . Every time you turned around at the Florida gathering , you were reminded that Ford is the " World Car Company . " All of the press releases were printed on stationery trumpeting " News from the World of Ford , " complete with a small globe covered with assorted flags . At the press conference , Caldwell said the presence of so many foreign reporters " affirms Ford 's global interests , " and he made much of the success Ford has had in overseas markets ( it sells more cars outside its home market , for example , than any other auto maker in the world ) . The World Car Company came out with the World Car just a few weeks ago , the Ford Escort/Mercury Lynx that you 've seen in television and magazine ads draped in various flags . Other Ford advertisements for non-World cars use the same theme . A Granada magazine advertisement , for example , features a silver globe hanging over a silver car , which is said to be " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ campaign is a clever attempt to identify Ford with the growing popularity of imports , even while exploiting nationalistic prejudice . The main idea seems to be to persuade potential buyers that the Escort is just as good as an imported car , since it was designed by " engineering teams from America and overseas ... with better ideas from around the world . " Certainly this is a change from the days when Japanese products were synonymous with shoddy quality . Here the object is to convince the customer that he need n't be leery just because this is an American car . At the same time , Ford tries to appeal to patriotism . Its slogan " Built to Take on the World " implies that insome way we are at war with those countries so rash as to provide us with a product we want . An advertising brochure stresses that " Escort will be made in America fOr American drivers , " which might be taken as a suggestion that only un-American drivers buy cars made anywhere else . All this is intended to get Ford back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Escort has been a great success , despite a base price of more than $6,000 , In October and November Ford sold nearly 50,000 Escorts and Lynxes , and dealers ca n't keep up with demand . This fall 's other celebrated entry , the Chrysler K-car , has not done nearly so well . Actual sales in the first two months of production were well below what Chrysler had projected , and on December 9 the company said it would close two of its K car plants for three weeks . But even with the Escort doing well , Ford is still in serious trouble . In the third quarter of 1980 , it sold only two-thirds as many cars and trucks as in the third quarter of 1979 , and worldwide sales were down 24 percent . Things are bound to improve next yea r , btr Caldwell is predicting sales of about 10 million cars not a large increase over the roughly nine million tha Ford will sell this year . So the only other hope for Ford is that the government will step in and help by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in two ways . First , it would force some buyers who would prefer a Japanese car to buy an American car instead . Hence Ford would sell more cars . Second , it would tend to raise the price of Japanese cars and thus permit the US auto makers to raise their own prices without fear of being undercut . Hence Ford would be able to make more money on each car sold . Some experts doubt that import restrictions would help the domestic companies all that much , since most buyers can postpone purchases and since the biggest obstacle to new car purchases these days is the high cost of credit . But Ford is certain that imports are the source of its troubles , and that only Washington can stem the tide . In this light the get-together at Cape Canaveral begins to make sense . If Ford were competing under laissez-faire capitalism , it would have little choice but to impose the most severe discipline on itself , to squeeze every ounce of production out of its dwindling resources . But the people running Ford know that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easiest of all is to get government protection from competition . To get that , a company does n't need to cut costs or improve efficiency . Instead it needs to get its views reported sympathetically , to make its accomplishments known , and to gain an image as a dynamic , forward-looking corporation which will set the world on fire if only , if only the government will just help it through this one crisis , which of course is not its own fault . Instead of concentrating on making a better product , you spend a lot of time and money on public relations . Looking like a deserving recipient , after all , is half the battle of getting government help . Ford 's gathering last week would have served all these purposes beautifully ? except for the small matter of the postponed launch . After all Ford 's efforts to make up for its own failures as a producer with imaginative public relations , it was only fitting that last week even the public relations flopped .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
