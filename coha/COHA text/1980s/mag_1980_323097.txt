The defeat of the conservative Liberal Democratic Party Cabinet came on a no-confidence vote that was introduced by the opposition Socialist Party . The motion leveled serious charges against the government : inaction against corruption in its ranks , recklessly inflationary economic policies , excessive defense spending .

After the vote , Fukuda insisted that he had warned his faction members against such a move . " It was a big miscalculation , " he said . Later , however , he refused to rule out the possibility that he might bolt and form a new conservative party . <P> Ohira was so angry that he refused comment . The Prime Minister , who took office in December 1978 after defeating Fukuda for the party leadership , had just returned from meetings in Mexico , Canada and with President Carter in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are held , probably at about the same time as the upper-house balloting next month . But by then he will have had to face an even tougher fight to prove once again that he is the strongest man within his own party .
