VICTORY <P> Directed by John Huston Screenplay by Evan Jones and Yabo Yablonsky <P> Half time at the soccer match : the trailing side troops wearily into the dressing room , down by three points , battered , bruised and certain that their opponents own the referee . The time is World War II , the place is Paris , and these are the underdog 's underdogs : a team of P.O.W.s and concentration camp victims , recruited to play the Germans ' best and , by their inevitable loss , offer some more spurious proof of Aryan superiority . <P> But a plot-actually the plot-is a foot . For the underground is literally underground , busily tunneling up into the changing room . If things go right , there will be no humiliating second half to endure : during the rest period the entire team will be spirited away . Good idea - but it reckons without simple psychological fact . In civilian life these chaps were professional athletes , for whom the only wins and losses that counted were on the playing fields . So halfway to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can beat these guys . " Back up the ladder and into the stadium they go , in search of at least a moral victory and , as none of them would express it , an assertion of civilian values-their camp leaders are against cooperating in a propagandizable sporting event , all for the escape-over military necessity . <P> This blend of The Great Escape ( with Sylvester Stallone in Steve McQueen 's old role as the prisoner obsessed with getting out ) and Rocky ( with the whole team playing Stallone 's old role ) has but one aim : to convert a movie audience-typically composed of individuals lost in private fantasies-into a sports crowd , in which singular preoccupations are submerged in communal joy as the home team is cheered on to a transcendence everyone shares . With Pel doing wondrous tricks on field , and Bill Conti 's huge score blasting away underneath John Huston 's superb blending of game action with the stadium 's increasingly delirious response to it , Victory achieves its goal . Anyone who does not find himself yelling along with the extras should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Which is not to imply that all of Victory 's simple but highly effective values are to be found in its last half-hour . The funny , smart script does what sports pages do before any big game : provide brisk sketches of the leading participants . Max von Sydow is the German officer who conceives the contest -a gentleman anti-Nazi who thinks nations should settle their disputes in games . Michael Caine , player-coach of the Allied team , is working class and quite bedeviled by the Oxbridge types who run the escape committee and deplore people who play boys ' games when there 's a war on . They do n't seem to realize that most of their plans for sneaking out are also boys ' games . As always , these two stars are marvelously professional , and even Stallone 's ego is more or less under control here . As for Pel , no one asks him to act . He is required merely to be what he has always been : a magical figure . That he is , and he suits a movie that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but totally winning . <P> - By Richard Schickel
