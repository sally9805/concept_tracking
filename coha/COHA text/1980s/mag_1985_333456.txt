It was nearly noon , and Nancy Reagan stood in the Red Room with a butler , waiting . Over in the Oval Office , her husband had just finished the most consequential diplomatic meeting of his first term , last fall 's tete-a-tete with Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko . Now , for a few minutes , she was to do her duty as First Lady , to greet and charm the visitor from Moscow . <P> Something to drink ? Gromyko took a glass of fruit juice , Nancy one of Perrier ; the chitchat was of liters and pints , metrics vs. the old American way . But then Gromyko abruptly turned the small talk big . " Does your husband believe in peace or war ? " he asked . <P> " Peace , " she said . <P> " You 're sure ? " Yes , she said , she was sure , and the conversation floated back to more effervescent subjects . When it came time for the two men to go in to lunch , however , Gromyko returned to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instructed the President 's wife , " you whisper peace in his ear every night . " <P> " I will , " she replied . " I 'll also whisper it in your ear . " <P> Three months later , Nancy Reagan describes the heady encounter with precision and some satisfaction . She is pleased not so much that she got the last word with Gromyko but that the exchange took place at all . If Gromyko had come in 1981 instead of 1984 , she says , " he probably would n't have broached it . " Why ? " Because I was different then . " <P> Gromyko may or may not know it , but Nancy Reagan has changed . She still sometimes wears extraordinarily expensive Galanos dresses ( size 4 or 6 ) and $950 beaded silk evening pajamas by Adolfo , and she still conveys a certain brittle , recherche haughtiness that drives feminists crazy . But she is no longer the liability for the President that she sometimes was during his first two years in office . In fact , in the past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , winning friends and influencing people . She remains tightly wound , by her own description " a born worrier , " but now she has a public and private sure-footedness that she once seemed unable to manage . " I have more self-confidence , " she says . A longtime presidential aide agrees . " She has become more of a person in her own right , " says the aide , " and no longer just Ronald Reagan 's wife . " The First Lady delivers speeches more often and more effectively , and recently engaged an outside writer to provide her with new , improved material . She has plunged into unfamiliar territory , sitting on Mr. T 's lap at a White House Christmas celebration , opening her arms to a young addict at a California drug rehabilitation clinic and , in Peking last spring , responding gracefully when Chinese Leader Deng Xiaoping suggested to her that " next time " she " come alone . " A few weeks ago she agreed to spend time with drug-addicted inmates at a jail in the heartland . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For Nancy Reagan has become a forceful figure within the Administration , and in recent months her White House clout has become strikingly apparent .
