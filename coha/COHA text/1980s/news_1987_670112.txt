Investor Carl Icahn dropped his $7. 19 billion bid for USX Corp. , saying the Pittsburgh-based steel and oil giant had made it " all but impossible " for him to complete his $31-a-share proposal . The withdrawal of Mr. Icahn ' s bid eases the pressure on USX to rush ahead with a massive restructuring program triggered by the New York investor ' s Oct. 6 bid . Nonetheless , some USX sources  --  while acknowledging that Mr. Icahn may be attempting a graceful withdrawal  --  noted that he could still pose a threat . Separately , negotiators for USX and the United Steelworkers union worked toward a weekend settlement of the longest steel strike in the nation ' s history . Sources indicated that USX was pushing for a settlement by tonight , but predicted that negotiations  --  unless broken off  --  would stretch into next week . Wall Street investors quickly labeled the bid ' s withdrawal as the latest and largest takeover casualty of the Ivan F. Boesky insider-trading scandal . Mr. Icahn ' s financial adviser , Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to USX chairman David M. Roderick , disclosed in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing yesterday , Mr. Icahn made no mention of the Boesky investigation . Rather , he said that USX ' s decision to redeem a series of guaranteed notes had effectively raised the cost of the acquisition by about $3 billion , to $10 billion , an excessive price that couldn ' t be financed . Moreover , investors have questioned the ability of Drexel to raise the original $7. 19 billion . Drexel denied that claim . Mr. Icahn added in his letter to Mr. Roderick that he and other USX shareholders " will evaluate with great interest " the restructuring proposal USX has said it will present to its board by the end of January . Mr. Icahn said he will be " disappointed " if the restructuring doesn ' t raise the value of USX stock to $25 a share . In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday , USX closed at $22 , down 75 cents , with almost 2. 8 million shares changing hands . Mr. Icahn , USX ' s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for what he might do with his 30 million shares , or 11. 4% , of USX . In his SEC filing , he said he might increase his holdings , wage a proxy fight , propose other business combinations or dispose of his stake . But he ruled out accepting greenmail , or any payment at a " higher consideration " than that offered to other shareholders . Nonetheless , Wall Street investors said they thought the battle between USX and Mr. Icahn , which began with Mr. Icahn ' s bid last October , had ended in a victory for USX . " I don ' t expect to see another bid from Mr. Icahn , " said one arbitrager . " I only hope he ' s able to hold their feet to the fire and get some value for shareholders . " The drop in USX shares to $22 on the Big Board yesterday reflected investors ' disappointment that the long-awaited tender offer by Mr. Icahn wouldn ' t materialize . Wall Street traders said the decline wasn ' t steeper because many holders had already discounted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boesky scandal broke . USX shares peaked at $28. 75 on Oct. 7 , the day Mr. Icahn disclosed an 11. 4% stake in the company and the day after he announced his original bid of $31 a share for the shares he didn ' t already own . The week after the Boesky scandal broke , USX shares dropped to $21. 50 , causing enormous losses for many professional investors . Wall Street sources said that unless USX ' s restructuring boosts the stock price from current levels , Mr. Icahn is also likely to have substantial losses on his holdings , which he acquired at an average price of $22. 50 a share . He also incurred substantial legal and investment banking fees . Mr. Icahn declined to comment beyond the contents of his SEC filing . Leon Black , co-head of mergers and acquisitions at Drexel , denied that Drexel ' s financing abilities had anything to do with Mr. Icahn ' s decision . Drexel " never backed away from its commitment to finance a friendly , $7 billion bid , " Mr. Black said . Wall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and of Drexel ' s involvement in the continuing investigation , USX officials told Mr. Icahn that Drexel ' s letter saying it was highly confident it could raise the necessary financing wasn ' t adequate , and that USX doubted Mr. Icahn could finance his proposed bid . The sources said Mr. Icahn was in the process of trying to arrange other financial commitments to satisfy USX when the company announced its note redemption last week , thereby causing Mr. Icahn to abandon the effort . Nonetheless , some analysts questioned the degree to which USX doubted Mr. Icahn ' s ability to finance a bid after the scandal broke . The company and the investor held long talks in which USX sought a standstill agreement from Mr. Icahn . " If they didn ' t believe we could finance the bid , then why were they so concerned about getting a standstill ? " queried Drexel ' s Mr. Black . Like Drexel , Mr. Icahn has been subpoenaed in connection with the government ' s continuing investigation of the Boesky scandal . A subpoena is a request for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Icahn ' s lawyers at Weil Gotschal &; Manges in New York said the investigation had " absolutely no connection " with the withdrawal of Mr. Icahn ' s bid . Mr. Icahn ' s decision has raised doubts on the part of some analysts about the necessity for USX to restructure . The company ' s move to redeem the notes would make the financing of a bid by any other suitor more difficult . And while another suitor might still be able to propose a per-share price substantially below the $31 proposed by Mr. Icahn , the immediate pressure on USX has decreased . USX declined to comment . The withdrawal of Mr. Icahn ' s bid came as USX and union negotiators conducted an intense round of bargaining aimed at ending a record 162-day strike . Sources close to the talks said Mr. Roderick and Lynn Williams , the union president , spoke by telephone yesterday after meeting each of the two previous days . The top-level meetings followed mediator Sylvester Garrett ' s submission of a proposed agreement Monday . " We ' re making progress , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one source , who added that " there is an awful lot of ground to cover to finish anything this weekend . " Mr. Garrett , a steel industry arbitrator for three decades , was called in Dec. 18 to mediate the dispute after a second round of bargaining failed . The two sides have exchanged at least three sets of proposals this week , reflecting the Pittsburgh attorney ' s recommendations . USX is thought to be pushing for a settlement of the dispute this week in order to allow for ratification before Feb. 1 . Such ratification isn ' t assured . Any tentative contract must first pass muster with the roughly 50 union local presidents representing USX steelworkers . Then , the pact would face a rank and file vote by about 45 , 000 union members , half of them on furlough . In addition , sources close to USX say the company has already decided to shut extensive portions of its steel mills after the contract is signed , resulting in more job losses for the union . Such a move would further endanger the ratification @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in substantial charges by USX . Industry sources said the company would prefer to record most of the charges in the just-ended fourth quarter , but has delayed an announcement for fear the closings might complicate the labor talks .
