Topped by green , onion-domed cupolas , the St. Alexander Nevsky Cathedral overlooks the center of Tallinn , a reminder of Estonia 's two centuries of domination by the Russian Czars . Last week a crowd of more than 1,000 gathered at the church portico to demonstrate support for the Estonian supreme soviet , or parliament , as it joined in a battle of wills with Moscow . Near the cathedral steps , an elderly woman clutched a pennant of blue , black and white , the colors of the long-banned Estonian flag . Students in blue and crimson visored caps unfurled banners . NO TO COLONIAL LAWS read a sign in Cyrillic lettering . <P> Across the square at Toompea Castle , 264 deputies were assembled in the parliamentary chamber for an extraordinary session . After a day of sometimes passionate debate that was broadcast live over radio and television , the legislators , in an unprecedented display of national assertion , voted unanimously to reject a package of proposed constitutional changes that will be presented next week to the Supreme Soviet in Moscow . <P> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they agreed to amend the Estonian constitution to grant the republic 's own supreme soviet the right to " suspend or establish limits " on Moscow-promulgated legislation affecting Estonian territory . Another vote made state property the possession of Estonia rather than the Soviet Union . Yet another called for a new " treaty of the union " with Moscow based on " principles of parity . " Never was the word independence mentioned , but the delegates made clear that Tallinn wanted a radically different relationship with Moscow . Declared Estonian Communist Party Leader Vaino Valjas : " The future of the country is in the hands of us all . " <P> It was as if a mouse had suddenly decided to roar at a bear . The day after the session , the bear growled back . TASS announced that the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the U.S.S.R. , the national legislature , considered the Estonian decisions " at variance with the provisions of the current constitution of the U.S.S.R. " The Presidium declared that it would consider the issue at its next meeting and " invited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stage for a showdown between Moscow and one of the Soviet Union 's smallest and most recently acquired republics . Nonetheless , on a state visit to India last week , Mikhail Gorbachev made an effort at conciliation . He praised Estonia for its " pioneering work to develop initiatives , " and admitted that " there have been mistakes " in Moscow 's dealings with the republic . " They have many constructive proposals , but there are also some which have been dictated by emotion , " he said . " I hope we shall decide everything correctly . " <P> Gorbachev 's remarks contrasted with comments he had made just before the extraordinary session in Tallinn . During a speech at the southwestern agricultural center of Oryol , he acknowledged that his policies of glasnost had " brought to light a lot of problems . . . in interethnic relations . " But Gorbachev declared , " We decisively condemn attempts at artificial aggravation of these questions , at advancing ultimatum demands . "              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
