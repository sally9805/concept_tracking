The major career decision for celebrities at the moment is not whether to sell out but which cola to endorse when they do . In the latest episode of their unending battle to top each other , Coca-Cola and Pepsi are offering fees that almost no one can resist . Last week Pepsi announced that the Material Girl , Madonna , has signed up for a one-year global advertising campaign ( her estimated fee : almost $10 million ) . The title song from the singer 's new album , Like a Prayer , will debut in March on Pepsi 's prime-time television commercials . Pepsi 's team has already starred Michael Jackson , Tina Turner , David Bowie and the Miami Sound Machine . <P> Coca-Cola has not lost its fizz either . In December the company signed teen heartthrob George Michael for a diet Coke commercial , to begin this week , which features music from a previously unreleased single ( his fee : a reported $4 million ) . In the past , Coke has recruited the Pointer Sisters and Whitney Houston . All of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have chosen ?
