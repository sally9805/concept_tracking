Curren ' s 6-3 , 6-7 , 6-3 , 7-6 victory marked the first time that the 30-year-old Connors , a regular here since 1972 , had failed to reach at least the quarterfinals . Connors was seeded No. 1 in men ' s singles and was the defending champion . His defeat came on the No. 2 court , long known as a graveyard of champions. // Connors , who did not attend a post-match news conference , was not the only major casualty today . Brian Gottfried , seeded 13th , bowed to Mel Purcell , 4-6 , 6-3 , 6-3 , 6-2 . Chris Lewis of New Zealand , who will play Purcell Tuesday in the quarterfinals , ended the string of successes by Nduka Odizor of Nigeria , 6-1 , 6-3 , 6-3 . <> <> Hana Mandlokova Loses // Among the women , Jennifer Mundel , a 20-year-old South African , went on one of those roller-coaster rides that often accompany Hana Mandlikova ' s matches . The 5-foot-10-inch Miss Mundel , only 76th on the women ' s computer list , stayed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1-3 , for the eighth-seeded Miss Mandlikova to double-fault away the second set and then fade in a blur of errors , 5-7 , 6-4 , 6-4. // " I just wasn ' t playing my grass-court game , " said Miss Mandlikova , who had been pointing to a meeting with top-seeded Martina Navratilova in the quarterfinals . " I don ' t know what happened , but I know she was playing really well , too . I was looking forward to playing Martina. " // Based on the seedings , Billie Jean King ' s 7-5 , 6-3 victory over Wendy Turnbull was a mild surprise since Miss Turnbull was No. 7 and playing well and Mrs. King was 10th . But Mrs. King holds an 11-1 career edge over her Australian rival , and Wimbledon is practically her home turf. // Another former champion with home roots , Virginia Wade , again survived , to the almost delirious delight of many of her British countrymen among the crowd of 34 , 000 at the All England Club . Also playing on Court 2 , Miss Wade rallied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 30-40 in the third set to beat Eva Pfaff of West Germany , 3-6 , 7-6 , 7-5. // Unlike the center and No. 1 courts , which are enclosed with large seating capacities , No. 2 is essentially a field court adjacent to the main walkway on the grounds . It has only 2 , 020 seats and standing room for about 1 , 000 people , creating a distinctly different mood and depth perception for those stars accustomed to more selfcontained sanctuaries . <> <> Famous for Bad Bounces // For many years , the court gained its reputation because the shoddy , uneven quality of the grass created bad bounces . Ilie Nastase , top-seeded in 1973 , Arthur Ashe , seeded No. 1 in 1976 , and Evonne Goolagong , the No. 3 seeded player in 1974 , were also victimized there over the years . John Feaver , an obscure British professional , once served 42 aces in a losing cause to John Newcombe in 1976. // That the Connors-Curren match was relegated to Court 2 , while John McEnroe and Ivan Lendl won their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 courts , respectively , was especially surprising . A women ' s singles match between third-seeded Andrea Jaeger and 15-year-old Carling Bassett , which Miss Jaeger won , 6-4 , 6-3 , was also played on the center court. // " I don ' t see the justification of it , " the second-seeded McEnroe said after he defeated 14th-seeded Bill Scanlon , 7-5 , 7-6 , 7-6 , for a spot in the quarterfinals against unseeded Sandy Mayer . " It ' s pretty obvious that was one of the best matches on paper. " // " We had too many matches , " Alan Mills , the referee , said of his decision , " and somebody had to go outside . " Asked why the Jaeger-Bassett match had been scheduled for the center court over Curren-Connors , Mills said , " We have to be fair to the sexes , don ' t we ? " // The court has played more consistently this year , but its legend still seems larger than life . And the 12th-seeded Curren , who beat Connors earlier this year on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Queen ' s Club before losing to McEnroe , enhanced that image by stripping the two-time Wimbledon champion of his most effective weapon . <> <> Accurate First Serves // " I thought I served as well as I ' ve ever served in a match for that length of time , " said the 25-year-old Curren , who converted 72 percent of his first serves and committed only 5 double faults . " To keep it up for four sets , I was very happy . I almost got to the point where I could read where he was going to hit the return because I had him under so much pressure . So I had a lot of open court to volley to. " // Connors had not played a match here on anything other than the center or No. 1 court since the second round last year . At various stages today he appeared completely frustrated at his inability to break Curren. // No longer intimidated by Connors , even after losing a second-set tiebreaker , 8-6 , Curren served out the third set from 15-40 and saved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serve after 6 deuces with a forehand first volley winner and his 31st ace. // Serving at 5-6 , Curren made an almost unbelievable diving forehand stop volley winner at 15-30 , then followed with another ace and a flat first serve to Connors ' s backhand that the defending champion netted . From 2-all , Curren took the tiebreaker , 7-4. // A major factor behind Curren ' s improvement since he left the University of Texas has been Warren Jacques , his Australian-born coach . Jacques , who also works with Steve Denton , encouraged Curren to improve his stamina , sharpen his volley and change from a twohanded to one-handed forehand. // " His big problem has been that he ' s been in awe of the top three players , " Jacques said today . " But he ' s had some good wins this year , and he ' s starting to believe all the things I ' ve been telling him. // Like Roscoe Tanner , the secret to the force of Curren ' s serve is a relatively low toss and an ability to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point . Because the 6-foot-1-inch Curren has an exaggerated backhand grip and long arms and wide shoulders , his snapping wrist action on his follow-through can disguise the direction and pace of the serve. // " Connors was having trouble anticipating , " said Curren , who served 13 aces in the fourth set , including three in a row in the second game. //
