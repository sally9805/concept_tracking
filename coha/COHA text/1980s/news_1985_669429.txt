Miss Pauley , wife of cartoonist Garry Trudeau , mother of 14-month-old boy/girl twins , is co-host of ' ' Today ' ' ( NBC , weekdays , 7-9 a. m. ) and now the anchor of an NBC White Paper special : Women , Work and Babies : Can America Cope ? ( NBC , Saturday , 10-11 p. m. ) . // She makes it clear that her dedication to husband and children does not mean her position as ' ' the grande dame of morning television news ' ' is not an important aspect of her persona . Miss Pauley seems to thrive on her busy , varied life and , since her maternity leave , has been heralded by critics and colleagues alike as ' ' a new , mature woman . ' ' And most attribute the change to motherhood. // // I chatted the other morning with this still-pretty-and-perky , even if ' ' new , mature woman , ' ' in her comfortably ' ' undecorated look ' ' office at NBC headquarters in Rockefeller Center . Although she had just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after a quick taping of on-air promos for the NBC White Paper , for which she acts only as anchor rather than reporter , she seemed well groomed , well adjusted , and in complete control of the moment. // She ordered a hot drink and quickly looked over a folder of background notes on her desk . Then she took a seat behind her desk , at the same time making sure the interviewer was ensconced in a cozy Kennedy-era rocking chair . . . albeit slightly lower than her own chair. // ' ' New , mature Jane Pauley , ' ' she mused amusedly . ' ' What they mean is that I ' ve grown . Well , after eight years at the job , isn ' t it only natural ? It ' s age and experience , not hormones , that did it. ' ' // Jane Pauley is personally involved in all of the problems outlined in ' ' Women , Work and Babies : Can America Cope ? ' ' documentary . But she never mentions her own situation . Can she cope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personal life out of it , because I didn ' t want it to look like an exploitative setup , ' ' she says with a chuckle ; ' ' yet . . . here I am talking to you surrounded by pictures of my children on the desk . I don ' t think of myself as representative at all . I have a lot of advantages that the women in the documentary don ' t have . I have been discriminating about child-care help and can afford to be . I also have the luxury of a very flexible schedule . I don ' t have to catch a commuter train in the morning ( she leaves her comfortable Manhattan apartment at 5 for the 7 o ' clock start of ' ' Today , ' ' before the children are awake , if she is fortunate ) , and I don ' t come home after dark ( she can return to her apartment by 11 a. m. most days ) , and I can spend most midmornings , lunch , and afternoons with the kids . Sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to my door if I can ' t come to the office . So I put in a full day ' s hours but I have the luxury of doing so at home. ' ' // ' ' Women , Work and Babies ' ' is a prime example of the new direction in NBC News . It is solidly interesting as well as informative , honest yet hard hitting , and totally relevant . Now that two-thirds of American families include a working mother - there are 19 million working mothers - the fact is that America is not coping with the problems of child care and maternity leaves . Though the documentary does not offer any solutions , it does a public service by italicizing the fact that there has been a social revolution that has not been integrated into our society. // ' ' There are no quick fixes , ' ' Miss Pauley concludes after serving to introduce the incisive reporting work of Lisa Meyers and Jack Reynolds . ' ' Society has just begun to recognize that we have a problem . . . we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a straightforward TV program such as this can do a great deal to help alert America to the fact that the problem will not go away if it contunues to be ignored. // Has motherhood changed Pauley ' s work habits ? // ' ' I ' ve been forced to learn how to be efficient . I know what I have to do and I don ' t waste time doing things I don ' t need to do . I ' m really focused. ' ' // Has motherhood changed her attitude toward work ? // ' ' I don ' t want to dwell on my personal experience too much , but , as any woman in a work/baby situation will attest , coming back to work is a wrenching experience . I came back to work when my children were two months old . At that early age , they seem to have little awareness of anybody but their Raggedy Ann dolls , so it wasn ' t a matter of them missing me . I was missing them . . . . However , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and still be very close to being a full-time mother . But only with help at home. ' ' // The documentary deals mainly with the generation of working mothers with children under age 6 - Jane Pauley ' s generation - and she wants to make it clear that it is an ironic situation : ' ' Most of us in the baby-boom generation were raised by full-time mothers . Even as recently as 14 years ago , 6 out of 10 mothers with babies were staying at home . Today that is totally reversed . Does that mean we love our children less than our mothers loved us ? No , but it certainly causes a lot of guilt trips. ' ' // Are more women today choosing to give up their jobs and stay at home with their babies ? // ' ' That ' s a personal decision many women are struggling with right now . Many women I know did not go back to work like I did . I see that happening more and more . That is going to have an impact on career @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the focus of the documentary is tilted toward career women in executive jobs . ' ' Women who must work to help support their family have always been here , struggling alone . It ' s not a new phenomenon . What is new is this generation of career women who must weigh their personal satisfaction from the workplace against a yearning and need to be hands-on mothers at home . The women who must work to raise money can justify leaving in the morning . But women who choose to work carry a greater burden of guilt. ' ' // Are there signs that America is coping with the problems of working mothers ? ' ' No , That ' s what ' s so sad about this documentary . Women are not going to find a lot of comfort in it unless it is in knowing that so many other women are in the same boat . But misery loves company , so maybe there is some comfort in knowing that we are part of a broad phenomenon. // ' ' The bad news is that although working women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel a bit more guilty than ever about leaving their kids with others . The good news is that at least we are now talking about it. ' ' // Pauley is not a complainer and has obviously adjusted to being ' ' second banana ' ' to Bryant Gumbel on the ' ' Today ' ' show . She makes it clear , however , that although she is called ' ' co-host ' ' on the ' ' Today ' ' show , she recognizes that she is actually ' ' the lesser of two equals. ' ' // ' ' There is the perception that we are equals . But , in fact , Bryant Gumbel is the head guy , although not in the absolute way that David Hartman rules the roost on ABC ' s ' Good Morning , America. ' ' ' // When Barbara Walters was a regular on the show at the time Frank McGee hosted it , she was relegated , she now confides , to ' ' women ' s ' ' material . ' ' Unlike Barbara , ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if not 50-50 , of the meatier stories . . . . However , in the long run , I ' m second among equals. ' ' // Pauley explains that she is able to accept the situation because ' ' I ' m not driven by killer ambition . I ' m not a workaholic . I ' m a good team player . I don ' t have to be captain , but I do want to play on a winning team . Right now I ' m very much at peace in what I consider one of the best jobs in America. ' ' // Even though the children must be left at home for some of the time ? She laughs , then shrugs . ' ' My son has been known to throw a book at the television set when he called for me to come play and I was obviously busy in the box . But I ' m told that children of television performers grow up thinking that all mommies or daddies work on TV and that it ' s no big deal. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinks for a moment , but only a moment . ' ' It ' s only television. ' ' // Then she says , with a look of joy and anticipation in her eyes : ' ' Since the interview is over , can I show you some snapshots of Ross and Rachel ? ' ' // //
