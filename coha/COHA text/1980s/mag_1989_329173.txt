" After cabdriver Iran Bolton picked up an early morning fare at a Phoenix Ariz. , night spot , the customer held a broken bottle to her throat and forced her to pull into a deserted area . Robbing her of $70 , the thug pushed the woman out of her cab and threw her to the ground . When her assailant ordered her to crawl in the dirt , Bolton responded by emptying her pocket semi-auto into him . He died later in a hospital . " <P> Each month American Rifleman , the journal of the National Rifle Association , features about a dozen such accounts of armed citizens defending themselves against criminals . Based on newspaper clippings submitted by N.R.A . members , the stories dramatically show how a gun can sometimes prevent a crime and perhaps even save a victim 's life . <P> The gun lobby lands on mushier ground , however , when it leaps from such / examples into a far broader argument : that more lives are saved than lost by the firearms Americans acquire to protect themselves and their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two-page newspaper advertisement attacking TIME for its report ( ( July 17 ) ) on 464 gun deaths that occurred in the U.S. in a single week , chosen at random . " Legally-owned firearms saved the lives of far more Americans than those lost during ( ( TIME 's ) ) ' seven deadly days , ' " the advertisement stated . " According to noted criminologist Dr. Gary Kleck of Florida State University , every year some 650,000 Americans use firearms to thwart criminal assault . That 's 12,500 a week . " <P> Even Paul Blackman , research coordinator for the N.R.A. , concedes that the advertisement " stretches the data . " He adds , " I do n't know of any criminological study that has tried to quantify the number of lives saved based on the number of guns that were successfully used for protection . " <P> Kleck says his study did not consider the question of lives saved . Nor did he conclude , as the N.R.A . claims , that a crime or an assault had been " thwarted " in each of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) annual instances of a protective use of a gun . Kleck notes that his study may have included incidents in which a homeowner merely heard noisy youths outside his house , then shouted , " Hey , I 've got a gun ! " and never saw any possible attacker . <P> Still , Kleck estimates that an assailant or the defender actually fired a handgun in nearly half the cases . If so , 322,000 incidents each year involved great danger , and the potential victims credited their guns with protecting them . That is about ten times the number who die from guns annually in the U.S. " It is possible that guns save more lives than they cost , " Kleck says . <P> His numbers are based on a 1981 poll conducted by Peter D. Hart Research Associates . It asked 1,228 U.S. voters whether in the previous five years any member of their household had " used a handgun , even if it was not fired , for self-protection or for the protection of property . " Roughly 4% ( about 50 people ) said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of U.S. households in the five years covered by the poll ( 1976-81 ) , Kleck came up with the estimate that handguns had been used protectively 3,224,880 times , or 645,000 a year . Comparing that with surveys that included rifles and shotguns , he estimated that all types of guns are used defensively about a million times a year .
