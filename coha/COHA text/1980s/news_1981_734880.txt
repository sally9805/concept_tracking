txt It all began with a four-roll package of a toilet tissue called Soft ' N ' Pretty . It is ending in a legal battle that could be called neither . The combatants are Scott Paper Co. of Philadelphia and the Sanchez family of Fremont , Calif . The former is the maker of Soft ' N ' Pretty . The latter once bought the product . Therein he s the tale . Last summer . Brenda Sanchez . a 27-yearold housewife , went shopping at her local Alpha Beta supermarket . She selected a package of Soft ' N ' Pretty unaware that it contained a ticket for a promotional game called " Scott Cask " " I did n't even notice there was a contest going . " Mrs. Sanchez says . Mrs. Sanchez 's nine-year-old son . Scott , was more observant . As the Sanchezes recall . the boy tore open the package of Soft ' N ' Pretty and took out the ticket , upon which was printed a nine-square grid like that used in games of tick-tack-toe . In this case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under which was a dollar amount ; if three squares  --  lying either horizontally , vertically or diagonally adjacent  --  contained the same amount , the ticket holder was deemed a winner of that amount . Prizes ranged from $1 to 510,000 . Victory Show " We won ! " was the cry of Scott Sanchez , according to his family . The second horizontal row of the grid , the Sanchezes say . showed $1,000 in each of its three squares . And the trouble was about to begin . The next step came when Brenda Sanchez sent the ticket by registered mail to Scott in Chester . Pa .. just as Scott had stipulated for winners . The ticket was sent in the name of Mrs. Sanchez 's 28-year-old husband , Martin , who works in a floor-covering company 's warehouse as an order-filler . Going beyond Scott 's stipulations . Mrs. Sanchez insured the contents of the envelope for $1,000 . ' ' We wanted to make sure it got there , " she recalls . The family waited anxiously , but nothing happened . After a month @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chester and was told that a Scott employe had indeed signed for the envelope . But the company could n't find the ticket . It asked to see a duplicate . Mr. Sanchez mailed the company a photocopy . " I , thought that would clear things up , " he says . But it did n't . Two weeks later , he says , he called again  --  only to hear that Scott had pronounced his ticket invalid . Scott says it has built " verification codes " into each of the 24 million tickets it distributed . The first such code , the company says , is a small series of letters and numbers running down the right-hand side of each ticket . The Sanchez ticket is invalid , Scott says , because its code does n't match that of a winning $1,000 entry , of which 10 were printed . Wrong Number Moreover , as Scott reads the code on the Sanchez ticket , the company contends that it comes from a series in which the second horizontal row should read " $1,000 ? Si$1,000 " instead of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Company officials say the chance of a misprint is " remote . " In a letter to Mr. Sanchez explaining the company 's refusal to pay , Philip Sears , manager of Scott 's promotion services center , wrote : " Scott is acting in good faith in the conduct of this promotion and can only award the prizes to entries actually qualifying . Thank you for your understanding . " Mr. Sanchez , however , most certainly did n't understated . He continued to call the company , and he began sending letters to local newspapers and radio and television stations explaining his plight . One California TV station even put him on its 6 p.m. newscast . Meanwhile , Scott 's letters began to soften . " While we regret we can not award you the claimed prize , we will enter your name in the second chance sweepstakes for unclaimed prizes , " wrote S.D. Ford . Scott 's senior counsel . ( By law , the company is forced to distribute the total advertised amount of $250,000 in prize money , even if some winning tickets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that . He hired a lawyer and threatened to sue Scott for breach of contract , hoping to settle out of court . But the company did n't budge . so Mr. Sanchez headed for small-claims court , where the case was heard Jan. 13 . Mr. Sanchez testified . So did his wife and son . So did Mr. Sears of Scott Paper . who flew out to California to present the company 's side of the case . Judge Roy Pucci ruled for Mr. Sanchez . awarding him the court 's maximum of $750 plus S19 in court costs . " I felt the plaintiff proved his point . " the judge says . " I felt he should be awarded the money . " The paper company , however , appealed the decision . The hearing is set for March 10 in the Alameda courthouse . Says Mr. Sanchez : " I think someone ( at Scott ) is paranoid that I 'm trying to cheat them . " Says John Young . Scott 's director of promotions : " We are n't accusing ( Mr. Sanchez @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Mr. Sanchez 's ticket is bogus and that somebody tampered with it to make it a winner . It is. of course , basing its observations on the photocopy . ( Scott theorizes that the original ticket , which Mr. Sanchez mailed in and which was lost , may have been inadvertently mixed in with returned coupons and subsequently shredded . ( If , as Scott maintains , it Is n't charging that Mr. Sanchez altered the ticket , who does it think did ? Scott has n't any suspects . In an October 1980 letter to Mr. Sanchez 's lawyer . Mr. Ford , the Scott lawyer wrote : " While we obviously can not state your client was responsible for the apparent alteration of the ticket as revealed by the photocopy , we can not envision any reason why a third party would have altered the ticket While it is possible , it seems remote " Scott asked the U.S. Postal Service to investigate the matter but never heard from postal investigators . As far as the e%entual outcome is concerned , Mr. Sanchez seems calm at this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " we celebrate . If we lose . we 've just learned something . " If Scott wins , it seems eager to repair any reputation it may have developed as a skinflint . " If the court decision goes in our favor , we 're going to make a gift of S1.000 to the Hay Area United Way for use in Fremont , " says a company public-relations spokesman .
