This became increasingly clear this week as some Jewish leaders have begun to call for Mr. Mondale to repudiate Mr. Jackson for his association with Louis Farrakhan , the leader of a Black Muslim group who in a Sunday radio broadcast described Judaism as a " gutter religion " and characterized supporters of Israel as " part of a criminal conspiracy. " // Mr. Mondale , who seems to have enough votes to win the Democratic Presidential nomination , condemned Mr. Farrakhan for his statement and called upon Mr. Jackson to repudiate his associate , but the former Vice President stopped short of criticizing Mr. Jackson , as some Jews are now urging him to do. // Major non-Jewish organizations and the White House joined Jewish groups today in condemning the remarks by Mr. Farrakhan . ( Page A22. ) // Democratic Party officials and some of Mr. Mondale ' s own aides are concerned that criticizing Mr. Jackson would offend Mr. Jackson and his black supporters , causing them to sit out the election campaign against President Reagan. // As the controversy sharpened , some Democrats , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the former Vice President was aware of the delicate problem posed by Mr. Jackson and was searching for a solution. // Before this latest development , some of his campaign aides had said Mr. Mondale ' s strategy was to keep Mr. Jackson at arm ' s length while working through black big-city mayors in an effort to reach out to blacks. // Some Jewish leaders , however , said Mr. Mondale had passed the point where he could condemn Mr. Farrakhan but not Mr. Jackson . At the same time , some black leaders , including members of Congress who privately deplore Mr. Jackson ' s association with the Muslim leader but are not willing to criticize him publicly , privately expressed their concern that the pressure building for Mr. Mondale to separate himself from Mr. Jackson could be damaging to the party. // " It ' s a very sensitive matter and it ' s one Mondale is going to have to deal with , " said Representative Charles B. Rangel , a Manhattan Democrat and member of the Congressional Black Caucus . He added , however , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter with Jackson before deciding how much space , if any , he needs to put between them. " // <> <> Jackson ' s Role at Convention // Today , Representative Edward F. Feighan and Timothy F. Hagan , co-chairmen of the Mondale campaign in Ohio , urged party leaders to refuse to recognize Mr. Jackson at the convention unless he repudiated Mr. Farrak han . Michael Steed , executive director of the Democratic National Committee , said today that this latest development could have an impact on whether Mr. Jackson is allowed to speak at the convention , but that Charles T.Manatt , the party chairman , would have no further statements on the matter until Mr. Jackson returned from a trip to Cuba and had time to review the Farrakhan statement . Both the Democratic Party headquarters and the Mondale campaign offices said they were deluged today with telephone calls from Jews and others on the matter. // Mr. Hagan said there was " absolutely no way " Mr. Jackson could be allowed to participate in the campaign so long as he refused to dissociate himself from Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a political one , " Mr. Hagan said in an interview . " I ' d rather see us lose this election than to have our party ignore this anti-Semitism. " // Robert G. Beckel , Mr. Mondale ' s campaign manager , said there was " obviously some friction " between Mr. Jackson and American Jews , but added , " I don ' t think it ' s an irreversible problem at all . " He said the campaign at this point " absolutely has no strategy on Jackson , the black vote or the fall campaign. " // " We ' re just trying to get through the convention , " he said. // Another Mondale aide , however , said " a litmus test is developing " among Jews watching to see how Mr. Mondale dealt with the Jackson controversy . The Mondale campaign , concerned about a potential loss of Jewish votes to Mr. Reagan in November , has been quietly conferring in recent months with a wide range of Jewish leaders. // At the same time , Mr. Mondale has sought to raise the visibility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is counting on to mobilize the black vote for him. // " The question is will the Democratic Party make clear its revulsion at Jackson ' s failure to say that Farrakhan ' s language is the language of a bigot and Democrats want no part of him , " said Nathan Perlmutter , national director of the Anti-Defamation League of B ' nai B ' rith . " That is what has to be done at the convention . " <> <> ' Make It Unmistakably Clear ' // // Hyman H. Bookbinder , Washington representative of the American Jewish Committee , said in an interview : " Mondale has to separate himself from Jackson . If the country believes after the convention that his candidacy is being influenced by Jackson , Mondale might as well stay home . Jackson does not have to be excommunicated from the party , but it is important for Mondale to make it unmistakably clear that he has sharp differences with Jackson. " // Mr. Bookbinder said he talked to Mr. Mondale in recent days and was reassured that " his words and actions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jewish voters that there was no ground for concern. " // A prominent Washington lawyer and longtime friend of Mr. Mondale said he thought it would be difficult for the party to allow Mr. Jackson to play a prominent role in the campaign without risking political damage. // " I am skeptical that this can be done because there would have to be sufficient restraints on Jackson to keep him from saying or not saying some controversial things , " said the lawyer , who asked not to be identified . <> <> Dual Task Outlined // // This Mondale supporter , who is Jewish , said that the former Vice President must " take on Jackson on some issue and beat him. " // " He ' s got to be willing to have that kind of confrontation , " he said , " to separate himself from Jackson ' s negatives without disassociating himself from the concerns of black people. " // Robert S. Strauss , a former Democratic Party chairman and a Washington lawyer , said he did not think Mr. Jackson had forfeited his right to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should act now to spell out his differences with Mr. Jackson . " He needs to point out those issues they agree on but then make it clear that he will never agree with Jackson on the Mideast , Louis Farrakhan and runoff primaries , " said Mr. Strauss. // In recent weeks , Mr. Manatt , the party chairman , has defended Mr. Jackson against charges of anti- Semitism and has said the party will not disavow the civil rights leader in an effort to strengthen its ties with Jewish voters . " I don ' t consider Jesse Jackson to be anti-Jewish in any way , " Mr. Manatt said in a television interview earlier this month . He could not be reached for comment today. // The party leaders ' concern about offending Mr. Jackson and his supporters is based on the belief that he could have a dramatic impact on black voter turnout in key states. // //
