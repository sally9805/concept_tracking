The Federal Reserve System , concerned about the economy ' s sluggishness , cut its discount rate to 6% from 6 1/2% , bringing it to the lowest level since October 1977 . The move had been widely expected , although some economists were disappointed that the Fed didn ' t reduce the rate a full percentage point . The reduction in the discount rate , which is the fee charged by the Fed on loans to financial institutions , is effective today . The Fed ' s action appears to have been taken without plans by West Germany and Japan to make accompanying rate cuts . In the two previous discount rate reductions this year , the Bundesbank and the Bank of Japan joined in . By acting on its own , the Fed is effectively stepping up U.S. pressure on Bonn and Tokyo to stimulate their economies . The West German and Japanese authorities have been resisting U.S. calls for easier credit policies . This had raised questions about whether the Fed would agree to a unilateral cut . Fed Chairman Paul Volcker has expressed concern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollar by lowering relative returns on U.S. investments . Yesterday ' s action made it clear that both the Reagan administration and the Fed have tired of waiting for the allies to cut their rates . A high-ranking administration official warned this week that the Fed would act unilaterally if it had to do so . He also said undesirable consequences might follow for the West Germans and Japanese if they failed to cut their rates in tandem with the U.S. , because their currencies would presumably rise against the dollar , making their goods less competitive on world markets . In recent weeks , Fed policy makers have concluded that " they can force the Japanese and the Germans " to follow a U.S. rate cut , according to one administration source . Bond traders reacted cautiously to the move . Prices of actively traded Treasury bonds edged higher after the news was announced late yesterday afternoon but later drifted lower , winding up with small gains for the day . Some Treasury issues registered gains of about a quarter point , or around $2. 50 for each $1 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Fed move was approved by a 6-to-0 vote by the board of governors . In a statement yesterday , the Fed said the action " appeared appropriate in the context of a pattern of relatively slow growth , comfortably within capacity constraints in the U.S. and the industrialized world generally . " The Fed statement also cited " relatively low prices of a number of important commodities " as well as " great stability in prices of goods generally . " Moreover , it said two broad measures of the money supply , known as M2 and M3 , are near the midpoints of the Fed ' s target ranges . The Fed move is likely to persuade banks to cut their prime lending rates to 8% soon , several analysts predicted . The prime , or base , rate on corporate loans currently stands at 8 1/2% at most major banks . The wording of the Fed statement " does suggest they have some concerns about the economy , which remains extremely sluggish , " said Robert A. Brusca , chief economist and senior vice president at Nikko Securities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other analysts said they expect faster economic growth in coming months , and that it is unlikely the Fed will lower the discount rate further anytime soon . " I think Fed officials will wait for quite some time for third-quarter data to come in before they cut the discount rate below 6% , " said James L. Cochrane , chief economist of Texas Commerce Bancshares Inc. in Houston . He expects interest rates to be " stable " in coming months . The wording of the Fed statement " does suggest they have some concerns about the economy , which remains extremely sluggish , " said Robert A. Brusca , chief economist and senior vice president at Nikko Securities Co . International in New York . He and several other analysts said they expect faster economic growth in coming months , and that it is unlikely the Fed will lower the discount rate further anytime soon .

Cochrane , chief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expects interest rates to be " stable " in coming months . Nevertheless , the Fed probably will continue to face heavy pressure to speed up the economy , especially with congressional elections coming this fall , other analysts say . " I expect at least two more half-percentage point cuts in the discount rate within the next two months , " said H. Erich Heinemann , chief economist of Ladenburg , Thalmann &; Co . " The pressure from the Reagan administration to force rates lower to provide stimulus to the economy is absolutely overwhelming . " The Fed ' s policy-making arm , known as the Federal Open Market Committee , met Tuesday and Wednesday for its semiannual review of its money supply targets and to plan credit strategy for coming weeks . Chairman Paul Volcker is scheduled to give his midyear review of monetary policy at a Senate Banking Committee hearing July 23 . Money supply figures released yesterday by the Fed showed the basic measure , known as M1 , rose only $100 million in the week ended June 30 . That left it well above the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year . But many analysts contend that the Fed ' s policy-making committee this week decided to increase its target for M1 , which consists of checking deposits plus cash held by the public . The M1 measure rose to a seasonally adjusted average of $666. 3 billion in the week ended June 30 from a revised $666. 2 billion the previous week . The previous week ' s figure was originally estimated at $666. 4 billion . The Fed also reported increases in two broader measures , M2 and M3 , that came as no surprise to most analysts . The M2 measure rose $20. 3 billion in June to a seasonally adjusted average of $2. 6673 trillion , while M3 increased $19. 7 billion to $3. 3269 trillion . Although the discount rate cut had been widely anticipated for weeks , the timing surprised many analysts . Several said they hadn ' t expected the cut until next Friday , while others had expected Japan and West Germany to lower their rates first . Some analysts predict that Bonn and Tokyo will probably wait a few days to gauge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ currency markets . According to this reasoning , if the dollar doesn ' t decline much , neither the Bundesbank nor the Bank of Japan will feel compelled to cut rates . On the other hand , if the dollar does fall , both central banks can cite exchangerate considerations as the principal reason for cutting interest charges . They can thus avoid the appearance of having taken action simply out of deference to U.S. wishes . The Fed said it acted to cut the discount rate on requests from the boards of all 12 Fed regional banks . Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole ( R. , Kan. ) , who in a series of recent statements had urged Chairman Volcker to cut the discount rate , praised the Fed action . " I ' m pleased the Fed has taken action to lower interest rates . It ' s the first step in stabilizing , and hopefully stimulating , today ' s sluggish economy , " Sen. Dole said . " Now it ' s up to Congress to close the deal by attacking the federal deficit head on . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' s Congress ' s turn .
