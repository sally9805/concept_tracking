Anyone facing major surgery has reason to be fearful . In recent years that fear has been magnified by the threat of a terrifying complication : contracting acquired immunodeficiency syndrome from a blood transfusion . Since 1981 , 414 Americans have developed the deadly disease after receiving contaminated blood . The introduction last year of screening tests for AIDS antibodies has made the nation 's blood supply much safer , but it has not completely eliminated the risk . Thus last week a panel of 13 doctors and blood-bank officials met at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda , Md. , to discuss what more could be done to ensure the safety of transfusions . Among the experts ' conclusions : that patients facing surgery should , whenever possible , prepare by making autologous donations  --  stockpiling their own blood for use when they need it . " If you have an operation scheduled , " says the panel chairman , Dr. Thomas Chalmers of Mount Sinai Medical Center in Manhattan , " it 's much better to get your own blood . " <P> The threat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " We would have endorsed this even if the AIDS problem had never come along , " says Chalmers . Patients receiving blood other than their own run the risk of allergic reactions and the possibility of complications due to errors in matching blood type . Hepatitis is an even greater danger . Although blood is screened for hepatitis , one type known as non-A , non-B hepatitis can not be readily detected . In some urban areas , it strikes 7% to 10% of patients receiving blood transfusions . <P> Still , despite the boost given to autologous donation when President Reagan mentioned it during a recent interview , the panel did not look kindly on its use by people who simply wish to stockpile their blood for a rainy day . The practice , which is made available by a host of new commercial blood banks , might threaten the supply of blood available to the general public . This concerns the American Red Cross . " The present system provides the opportunity for individuals who are healthy to provide blood for individuals who are sick , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many people reserve blood for their own use , he warns , " we will have fragmented an American institution that has been very beneficial . " <P> NIH panel members emphasized that the risk of contracting an AIDS infection from donor blood is quite remote . " You have a greater chance of dying from the anesthesia , " noted Dr. Richard Aster of the Blood Center of Southeastern Wisconsin . Stanford University Statistician Lincoln Moses estimated that about 120 AIDS-infected samples slip into the blood supply each year , out of a total of 12 million units donated . Since each pint donated can be split among two or three recipients , as many as 360 people could receive AIDS-infected blood each year , though how many will develop the disease is unknown . The main reason for the slipups , explains Chalmers , is that the existing blood- screening test detects antibodies to the AIDS virus rather than the virus itself . Since someone infected with the AIDS virus may take several weeks to develop antibodies , he says , " there is a dangerous window of time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
