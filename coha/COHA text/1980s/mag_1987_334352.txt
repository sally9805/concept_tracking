Rossignol , France 's premier ski manufacturer , has traditionally been the undisputed king of the slopes . From Jean-Claude Killy to Erika Hess , European stars have slalomed to championships on Rossignol skis . Last season the French company sold 1.9 million pairs , giving it 25% of the $800 million world ski market . <P> Suddenly , though , Rossignol 's reputation has taken a spill . French skiers , ! two-thirds of whom use skis supplied by Rossignol or its Dynastar subsidiary , have had a dismal season . It culminated earlier this month with their total failure at the world championships in Crans-Montana , Switzerland . While Swiss skiers claimed eight gold medals and even tiny Luxembourg carried off a gold , not one of the 30 prizes at stake was won by a French skier . The dejected French competitors blamed the bad showing on their skis and on poor preparation by the team 's technical support staff , most of whom are Rossignol trained . The case against the skis gained new evidence when a French downhill contender , Philippe Verneret , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and improved his time by two seconds , enough to boost him from 27th to eleventh place . <P> When news of the ski switch leaked out , Rossignol 's stock immediately slumped from 1,521 francs ( about $249 ) to 1,350 francs ( $221 ) on the Paris Bourse . The team criticism and the stock plunge , which wiped out 11% of Rossignol 's market value , stung company officials . Stormed President Laurent Boix-Vives : " We do n't have to prove ourselves . Half the 66 medals awarded at the Sarajevo Winter Olympics and the last two world championships , including 13 golds , were won on our skis . " <P> Rossignol 's stock recovered somewhat last week , but prospects for the French ski team are still discouraging . " The only way for them now is up , " says a Rossignol spokesman hopefully . In the world of downhill skiing , however , that is not the easiest direction to attain .
