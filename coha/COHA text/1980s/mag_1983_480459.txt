What Girl Scouts do when they 're not selling cookies . IN MARCH 11 , 1982 , fifty-two Girl Scouts assembled at the United Nations to present a " Gift of Water " to the world . It was a lovely ceremony . Water donated to the scouts from each of the states and from Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia was ceremoniously poured into a common vessel , the contents of which were to be spilled , a few months later , at the ceremonial planting of a tree at a new scout conference center . Certificates explaining the waters ' origins and importance were on display at the U.N. , which has declared the 1980s the International Drinking Water and Sanitation Decade . Mrs. Gouletas-Carey appeared on behalf of her husband , the governor of New York , to proclaim Girl Scout Week in the state . The occasion was the seventieth anniversary of the Girl Scouts of the United States of America , and the ceremony epitomized the organization it celebrated . Like Girl Scouting , it was pretty . It was feminine . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of charity and service , with overtones of national and international harmony . And most of all , it was uncontroversial ? nobody , but nobody , could quarrel with water . ( " I think water is so important , " explains Frances Hesselbein , national executive director of GSUSA , " because without it , there 's no life . " ) The ceremony , in short , was the ideal Girl Scout Event . It was an auspicious moment for a successful event . At that point , the 1980s were looking good . Hopes were high , for the first time in about twelve distressing years . The Seventies had been terrible , and scouting was n't used to terrible . Never during its first fifty years had GSUSA seen a single year of falling enrollment . In 1950 , in recognition of its solid and worthy position in the national Rachel Flick is a speechwriter who lives in Washington , D.C. life , Congress had even conferred upon it a congressional charter , that it might " continue to inspire the rising generation with the highest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " In 1969 , the peak year of its enrollment , it had claimed a membership of 3,921,000 , which made it the largest girls ' organization in the world . The thing had looked impregnable . And then in 1971 the numbers had just started falling .. .. A few years later , GSUSA had lost fully a million girls . Action was called for , and was undertaken . The Seventies were a time of change ? big change ? and apparently to good effect , for in 1979 the decline seemed finally to have been arrested . So it was with well-earned pride and confidence that GSUSA undertook this grand new endeavor for the Eighties . It was announced that day at the U.N . that scouts all over the nation planned a variety of water projects to last for the next ten years . Some scouts would " conserve , clean , and care about " water ; some would cook seafood dishes ; others would " help people cope " with hurricanes . For scouts all over the land , the 1980s were declared to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been a more appropriate symbol , for in its frantic attempts to anticipate and accommodate to the needs of a changing world , the organization threw out much of what had been best in it and offered girls who wanted to be scouts something very like water ? colorless , tasteless , and liquid . HE GIRL SCOUTS began in England as the female counterpart to the Boy Scouts , created at the turn of the century by Lord Robert Baden-Powell , a hero of the Boer War . " I had used scouting ? that is , woodcraft , handiness , and cheery helpfulness ? as a means for training young soldiers when they first joined the army , " wrote BadenPowell , " to help them become handy , capable men and able to hold their own with anyone instead of being mere drilled machines . " After returning home from South Africa , he decided that this kind of training ? militaristic in style , religious in outlook , and character-building in intent ? would be useful for " troops " of civilian boys " throughout the free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Central to Baden-Powell 's program were three statements that expressed what he really wanted to teach boys . The first two he claimed to have taken from the code of the knights of old : the Boy Scout Motto , " Be Prepared " ( when asked for what , he explained , " Why , for any old thing " ) , and the Boy Scout Law , " A Scout is Trustworthy , Loyal , Helpful , Friendly , Courteous , Kind , Obedient , Cheerful , Thrifty , Brave , Clean , and Reverent . " The third , the Boy Scout Oath , he worked up from the oath taken by youths of ancient Athens upon becoming citizens ( graciously described in the Boy Scout handbook as " the only oath out of the past that ranks with the Boy Scout Oath " ) : T N 1908 , when Baden-Powell published these statements and his program in Scouting for Boys , the book was an immediate best-seller , and Scouting the Movement was on its way . But it was n't just English boys who yearned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them over to his sister , Agnes , to organize , stipulating only that a uniformed girl not so much as greet a uniformed boy in public , and that the girls ' organization not use the Scout name . Thus were born the Girl Guides , which attracted the attention of Mrs. Juliette ( " Daisy " ) Gordon Low . A highly intelligent but deaf and wretchedly unhappy American woman who had recently been released from a miserable marriage by the death of her husband , a wealthy , philandering Englishman , Mrs. Low had plenty of time , money , and passion , and no sense of direction . By chance she had met Baden-Powell while she was wandering through Europe ; fired by what she took to be his selflessness , discipline , life of action ( and perhaps , as one biographer suggests , a more personal , though repressed , passion ) , Mrs. Low adopted him as her spiritual model and teacher . She met Agnes in England and then returned to her estate in Scotland , where she recruited seven local village girls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raise chickens for sale ? skills she thought would be useful to them later in life . Then she set sail for America . On her first night home , in Savannah , Georgia , she telephoned a cousin and announced , inwords often quoted by Girl Scouts ever since , " I 've got something for the girls of Savannah and all America and all the world , and we 're going to start it tonight . " She did not scruple to use the name of Scouting , though she did modify the Law and Promise for girls . To Mrs. Low , a Girl Scout was " Truthful , Loyal , Helpful , Friendly , Courteous , Kind , Obedient , Cheerful , Thrifty , and Pure in Thought , Word , and Deed , " and Promised on her Honor to " Do my duty to God and my Country , to help other People at all Times , and to Obey the Girl Scout Law . " W FARING WHAT WAS , in those frilly days , an ostentatiously sensible uniform designed by Mrs. Low herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Morse code , knot-tying ( " A knowledge of knots is useful in every trade or calling , " claims the first handbook ) , shooting ( " It is one of the best ways to ' Be Prepared ' " ) , and archery ( " excellent practice for the eye , and good exercise for the muscles . It makes no noise , does not disturb game or warn the enemy " ) . They also Cultivated the Faculty of Remembering Time , Observed Details of People ( " It is very instructive to note the different people we meet and try to form estimates of their character and disposition by their look and clothes " ) , and dealt " with small natural hits of information likely to escape any but specially trained eyes and senses . " All this was seasoned with the " true life " examples of Girl Scout heroines who triumphed over adversity and danger by following the Law ? " Brave girls whose pluck we admire . " And she was n't kidding about wanting Girl Scouting to be for all girls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Savannah , Mrs. Low had set up a three-tiered national structure to deliver her program . All Girl Scout troops were to be members of regional councils , and all councils were to be chartered by a single national office ( GSUSA ) . GSUSA itself was to operate no troops . Rather , its full-time job was to provide the basic idea and program materials ? it was to be , so to speak , the R &D; of scouting . Councils sprang up everywhere . Growth was explosive . There were eight American Girl Scouts in 1912 ; in 1915 their numbers had risen to 5,000 , and by 1920 , to something like 42,000 . ' This growth continued unabated . For if there was one fact about scouting that was true from day one . it was this : girls like it . They took to it like ducks to water . T T WAS inevitable that Girl Scouting should eventually feel the effects of the upheavals of the 1960s . Major changes had , of course , already been made since the days of Mrs. Low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for example , we were no longer Cultivating the Faculty of Remembering 45 Time ( weaving acrylic potholders , as I recall , was more our thing ) . Yet despite such changes , much of the Girl Scout program was simply not fashionable in the post-Sixties world ( " Pure in Thought , Word , and Deed ? " ) . So it was not really surprising that enrollment took a plunge . ( The situation with the Boy Scouts , which in 1974 lost 10.6 percent of its youth membership , is comparable . ) Nor , for that matter , was it unreasonable that GSUSA should decide some further changes were necessary if the organization was to stay current . But what was surprising , considering the program 's incredibly successful history , was the extent and character of this change . The organization adopted a " managerial idea , " installing a " corporate planning system , " which operated on the notion ? as explained by Mrs. Hesselbein , who has published on the subject in Philanthropy Monthly ? that management and planning are synonymous , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ data , demographic research , and local council experiences " about the " expressed preferences " of girls and leaders . In line with its new principle , GSUSA began asking its constituency what it preferred . It began seeking statistics . It held discussion groups . It sent around surveys . It started offering " try-its " ? " new ways of applying the basic principles . " By 1977 the results ? the " hard data " ? were in . It remained only to take the " action steps , " i.e. , to revise . The revisions were complete in 1980 , and GSUSA enthusiastically presented its redesigned program , which consists of seven new books for girls and leaders , including new handbooks , to the councils at a series of national program conferences . T HROUGHOUT the process of revision GSUSA had made a point of saying that it was n't going to touch the basics , but the new program begins with an emphatically new Promise and Law . And the character of the change in these principles is fundamental . " Trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to meanthinking about it a lot . Scouts are now asked to consider : " What parts of the Girl Scout Law do I value most ? " The Promise , too , is now read less than unequivocally . " Investigate , " a scout book urges , " the way the Girl Scout Promise and Law help you show your feelings about serving God and your country and your pledge to be a good citizen . " Perhaps the one value that is not treated subjectively is a sort of deferential appreciation for other cultures . This comes in handy , for example , in treating religion , which is now something of a sticky wicket . As one leader quite reasonably points out , scouting 's nondenominational policy makes religion difficult to take on in any serious way . " The only iimr common ground is belief in God , and who 's to say who God is ? One person 's god is not another person 's god . " Scouting , she feels sure , " would get a lot of flack from parents " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God tends chiefly to be the occasion for learning about colorful native celebrations and handicrafts , some of which enterprising scouts can reproduce in their troops with pipe cleaners and yarn . When the girls ' own culture requires that He make an appearance ? on camping trips that extend through Sunday mornings , for example ? God is simply introduced without the use of theological language . One leader describes the religious services she holds on camping trips as " a quiet time when you appreciate a particular subject , such as love , or friendship , or nature , and they the girls talk about it , and maybe read a poem about it . " While such subtlety solves the denominational problem , it also widens God to the innocuous breadth of a Hallmark card ; one wishes the scouts would punt or get off the course . Just as religion is defused , so is the uncomfortable question of patriotism . The first handbook . published in 1913 , was titled How Girls Can Help Their Country , and it included this ringing passage : You belong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the great world powers for enlightenment and liberty , It did not just grow as circumstances chanced to form it . It is the work of your forefathers who spent brains and blood to complete it . Even when brothers fought they fought with the wrath of conviction , and when menaced by a foreign foe they swung into line shoulder to shoulder with no thought but for their country . In all that you do think of your country first . Instead of sending her scouts to pour water , Mrs. Low sent one group of her girls to give " patriotic instruction " to New Bedford mill workers , when " foreign labor threatened to fall prey to the epidemic of Bolshevism and industrial unrest . " Obviously , this level of patriotic zeal needed substantial toning down . Still , GSUSA may now have modified it too far in the other direction . Today 's scouting is freighted with critical activism ? not the sort of attitude with which a child should begin her life as a citizen . For the new Girl Scouting , patriotism seems to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " what it really means to have allegiance to your country , and at what point you might not agree with your government . " The handbooks ? with updated titles such as Worlds to Explore and You Make the Diflerenceencourage scouts to learn how their communities operate , to think about what they 'd like to change , and to get busy . Girls so young they might not even have memorized Washington 's birthday are merrily invited to start fixing up their national fundaments . " Keep a record of all the laws you must follow .... Consider changing at least one of these laws so that more people would benefit . Write up your new law and be able to explain why your law is better ... . " The natural corollary of this is a vigorous and guilty concern for other countries . This concern figures heavily in a section of Worlds to Explore designated " The World Around You . " Here girls are invited to play a game in which each of them is assigned to represent a different nation , and each is dealt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of raisins that ( as nearly as I can make it out ) is about proportionate to her GNP . " Were the raisins divided fairly ? " the handbook asks . " How did you feel about the number you received ? Why should n't every girl he given the same number of raisins ? This may not make you feel very good inside , but it may help you to understand what it is like to be a child in some parts of the world . " Not that there are n't hungry people in the world , and not that children should n't learn at some point of their existence , but such abject liberal guilt seems a hell of a thing to hand to a nine-year-old . 0 NE of the differences between peoples that smiting does not celebrate , however , is gender . In a way , scouting has been " feminist " from the start . Seventy years ago , Mrs. Low enjoined her girls , " Be womanly . None of us like women who ape men . An imitation diamond is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made clear that this statement was positive as well as negative . Being " womanly " was different from being a man , but it was no less studied and energetic a pursuit , and she intended her scouts to do it proudly and well . Scouts of the Eighties , though , practice the feminism of the Eighties , which is a completely different ? and much more defensive ? kettle of fish . The handbook for girls aged six to eleven , for example , includes a game in which scouts clip from magazines pictures representing " men 's work , " " women 's work , " and " both " ? or at least , the handbook corrects itself , " what some photographer or artist showed as these kinds of work . What do you think ? are they right ? Ask yourselves , ' Who says so ? ' " In line with the new Girl Scout feminism , the badge book , too , has been changed . A badge is still the same sort of thing it was when I was a scout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an exploratory project on a specified subject . The badges are listed in a special book , each with its eight to ten requirements underneath it . I had the cooking badge , for example , which required me , among other things , to learn the four food groups . prepare a breakfast , and bake a cake ; when I had done all of this I received an embroidered cloth patch to sew on my uniform . The cooking badge , in fact , is a good example ? it was popular in my troop but girls today ca n't earn it , because it 's been excised from the book . Nowadays a scout can still earn such old favorites as " Hobbies and Pets " and " Books , " but if she 's interested in her kitchen . she has to shoot for either a badge called " Exploring Foods " ( which requires her to prepare a meatless meal and some foods from other cultures ) or another called " Healthy Eating " ( which includes both trying new foods and keeping " a record @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of each one , " and some lessons in consumer skepticism : " Tn what way do commercials teach good or poor eating habits ? ... " But no more sexist cooking . And no more sexist sewing , either ? today 's girls can study , instead , for their badges in " Textiles and Fibers " or " Art to Wear . " C1 IRL SCOUTS now read just about every ac-tivity in vocational terms . Motherhood is - Tconsidered a " career " choice ? listed in the new Girl Scout book Careers to Explore , right along with Gas Station Attendant and President of the United States . And with such options , of course , it makes sense that a scout should get started young ; so in the same book , six- to elevenyear-olds are invited to diagram their career potential : listing a favorite toy , for example , as well as who uses it and what job it helps you prepare for . Even leaders who are enthusiastic about the career program agree that it has to be sold with a song and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is . " It 's better , " one says , " when you do n't say ' eareers ' ? the more we work them into just plain troop fun , the more they respond . " For example , she says her girls really like the role-playing suggested in the career book . " We did the one that asked , ' What would you do if your boss was a man who insisted you get his cup of coffee ? ' There were a couple of girls who were quite insistent about ' Gee , well , let him get his own coffee , ' and a couple who said , ' What if he fires me ? ' It was a lot of fun . " Browsing further through the book , one wonders how much fun her scouts would have with the following outstandingly ungirlish problem:47 graph-drawers , listers , and calculators , and this business of reduce-and-quantify is not limited to careers . For example , girls are asked to fill out a " Me and Others Profile . " This is a chart that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( " I am able to : trust ; consider the feelings of ; give assistance when problems physical , mental , or emotional seem difficult for ... " etc. ) , and on its horizontal axis , a lot of people ( " Older females , " " people from racial , ethnic , religious groups not my own , " etc . ) . This allows a girl to , say , give herself a " 2 " in " asking for the help of " a " close friend . " " Girls like this ' Know yourself ' stuff , " one leader explains casually . " This is easy . " Imagine you are in your mid-twenties . You are married and have a twoyear-old child . After two years at home , you 're ready to return to full-time work . You find a job with hours from 9:00 to 5:00 , five days a week , paying $11,111 a year . Now you will need to combine your roles as homemaker and parent with your full-time paying job . In small groups , determine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by you and your husband on a typical working day . ... Decide who will do each chore . . . . Does one person have more time than the other ? .

It would hardly be surprising if such remote les-sons JiNimmitim ! - failed on a personal level , to enough , when every now and again the program does ask girls to " define their own career interests , " the plight of the working mother is forgotten , and the old familiar song emerges straight from their own hearts and lives , These girls almost invariably want to " explore " modeling or the stage . " Fashions , Fitness , and Makeup , " for example , was the career-exploration choice of the girls who enacted the secretary 's coffee dilemma . No matter what they choose to explore , they explore in the preferred Girl Scout mode @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social science . The scouts are fanatic chart-makers , HEN no t contemplating herself , today 's Girl Scout is supposed to be expressing herself . " Letting your feelings show can help make you feel better , " a handbook claims . " Here are some ways to let feelings out that wo n't hurt you or anyone else . " The list includes " Cry if you want to " ( " A Scout is Cheerful " ? ) and " Draw a really ugly picture . " In the past , Girl Scouts were supposed to learn about themselves by los-ing themselves in activity . Where the self was con-cerned , they preferred in-dustry to analysis . The original handbook . for ex-ample , enjoins : " Too soft a bed tends to make peo-ple dream , which is un-healthy and weakening . Do n't lay abed in the Em , t asgs ? morning thinking how awful it is to have to get up . Rouse out at once and take a smart turn of some quick exercise . " And then it proceeds directly to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Breathing through the mouth makes you thirsty . So does chewing gum . " There is one subject on which the Girl Scout program has gotten less rigorous and analytical , and that is nature . Instead of the detailed instruction in outdoor skills and the study of plant and animal life that characterized Low 's program , today 's handbook emphasizes " contemplation " ? sitting in a circle and C reciting Edna St. Vincent Millay . Nature is pictured as a playground for a girl 's fancy . " The next time your troop is anywhere where there are a lot of flowers , pretend that all of you are bees and butterflies . Zigzag from one flower to another . Look at blossoms from the insect point of view .... Make friends with an earthworm. - it enthuses . " Stop and say thank you ' to a tree . " This change is important , because the case can be made that nature ? or more specifically , camping ? is Girl Scouting . " Girls are scouts for lots of reasons , most of which are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . " Camping is the glue that holds scouting together . " It is certainly true that time and again girls say that camping is what they love most about the program ? but not , it seems , for its inspirational aspects . What they really love is playing messy games with their friends ( " shaving cream fights ! " ) and learning outdoor skills . 1 RINGS may have gotten a bit soft in the Girl Scout program , but at GSUSA headquarters they most definitely have not . In par- ticular , GSUSA is not soft about public re-lations . It has cultivated a genius for gesture . In 1979 , for example , it lent its endorsement to the United Nations Year of the Child ? children ; how nice . Ever mindful of its image , GSUSA has also been aware during the past decade of the need to recruit minorities ? and , of course , to make sure everyone knew of it . Conferences were staged on " Girl Scouting for Black Girls " and on " Girl ScoutingMexican-American Style . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own idioms . For its grand project in 1981 it ran a survey , conducted by the National Urban League , to assess the impact of minority participation on Girl Scouting and also the extent of " Girl Scout and public awareness of minority participation in Girl Scouting . " Most people , it turned out , thought it was all a real good idea . At the same time , GSUSA began to realize it was losing a still more valuable minority ? volunteers . There are 572,000 adults in scouting , and about one percent are paid staff . By 1979 there were 141 troops nationwide without leaders , and even more girls who wanted to be scouts for whom there were no troops at all . Women had begun returning to the work force , and it was suddenly necessary for GSUSA to motivate them to volunteer . GSUSA 's strategy was canny . It added a new perk to volunteering ; now leading a troop was handy not just to a woman 's soul but to her career . ( Today a Girl Scout troop leader , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adult education . Of course , GSUSA had always offered various sorts of training to its volunteer leaders : in the skills of the outdoors , for example , in the Girl Scout philosophy , and even in the simple management of a group . Today , however , GSUSA offers courses ranging from " the arts to computer technology , " from " camping to financial management . " In 1980 , GSUSA secured accreditation by the Council for Noncollegiate Continuing Education , a United States agency , to grant units of credit toward academic degrees to participants in these courses . These units of credit , explains Mrs. Hesselbein , " are a kind of recognition , whether you are working toward a degree or whether you are a homemaker , of the importance of your contribution . " Such recognition is not , however , awarded for the simple contribution of leading a troop ; it is only awarded for the taking of classes . And what a volunteer learns in those classes need not have any effect on what she does with her scouts , but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a paid position later . Apparently , voluntarism has yielded to careerism . Nowhere is this change better exemplified than in the development of the Edith Macy Conference Center . " Camp Edith Macy , " a training center for Girl Scout leaders , was established in Westchester County , New York , in 1926 . Its donor dreamed that it would become " a university in the woods . " In its early days , students " really roughed it " there , sleeping in tents and cooking out . In 1980 , however , GSUSA began construction of an $8 million , 200-person conference center on the Macy property . The center , now unfortunately called a " miniversity in the woods , " features technologically up-to-the-minute conference facilities ( video-complete , touch-of-a-button automatic , color-coded ) , rooms that would do a decent hotel proud , and complete food service in a luxury dining room . Still , it continues to claim " woodsiness " because , as its glossy-printed descriptive literature explains , the building 's " wood and stone construction materials are in harmony with those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not a bad metaphor for today 's characterless scouting , which , in its urge to modernize , has lost its clear identity ? the raison d ' ? tre and sense of mission that was uniquely its own and served generations of contented girls very well . Girl Scouting 's structure has something to do with this turn of events . The structure of the organization may have been what did it in . Right from the start , scouting has offered its local councils tremendous autonomy . This means that the organization is flexible beyond the ordinary , a quality that is both its strength and , currently , its weakness . Girl Scout councils are separately incorporated and set up their own structures for instituting and negotiating with their troops . And although they must adhere to certain standards in order to use the Scout name , it is possible for councils to be permanently chartered . This has the happy effect of allowing them to adjust to regional preferences ? potentially a source of great strength . But regional preferences are subject to considerable fluctuation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and , as with any all-volunteer organization , no one has much control over the staff . Councils , therefore , are rather vulnerable to the fads or fashions that prevail in their communities . This vulnerability may explain the " hard data " that arrived in the 1970s ? the data that led GSUSA to conclude , wrongly , that the assumptions on which the old program was based were obsolete . In forming this conclusion , the organization bent to pressure from its councils but managed to overlook a substantial and persuasive argument for keeping things as they were ? namely , the nature of the girls . Girls are not interested in making friends with an earthworm or making a " Me and Others Profile . " Confronted with the new program , they plump determinedly for its most reassuringly traditional aspects . Ask the members of any troop , anywhere , what badges they have and the answers are always the same : Camping , Child Care , First Aid , Books . They 'll tell you , with sincere faces , that they enjoy the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean is the old , volunteer-service sort of thing . A gum-chewing blonde named Heidi claspS her hands together ? glittery-blue nail polish gleaming ? when she talks about Christmas caroling at an old-folks home . " They smile at you and stuff , " she says . A thirteen-year-old scout from the Bronx summed it all up beautifully . " The best part , " she said , " is working with all of our friends and helping people out . " T HE MESSAGE is clear : one generation does not a transformation make . Girls wandered away from scouting in the Seventies because of unusual times , not because they were un-usual creatures . And their return to scouting in 1979 probably had more to do with societal changes than it did with the trendy new program ? which may be why , in 1980 , after their exploratory blip upward , those numbers headed right hack down again . in 1979 , enrollment reached 2,961,000 , but thereafter it declined and by 1982 had slid to 2,819,000 . Tales of professional success have not , apparently , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example of the Boy Scouts seems to confirm this failure . Faced with a similarly declining enrollment . BSA , after some initial waffling , held fast to its traditional program , to the point at which the program looked positively quaint . . But this quaintness , as it turns out , did not deter boys from becoming Scouts . Again , structure has a lot to do with it . There is relatively little regional variation in Boy Scouting : central control is strong , and as a result , the organization is stable and sturdy . The cornerstone of Scouting 's stability , however , is its doctrine . Of course BSA made some superficial changes to keep in step with the times . But its stated49 purpose remains , in the words of Ralph Derian , Scout Executive for the Greater New York Councils , " to help young people grow to responsible adulthood . We feel , " he continues , " that whether it hurts or not , it is our responsibility to train kids to be better kids , and we have to stick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 1979 edition of BSA 's handbook , which still claims , with a straight face , to be second only to the Bible in offering " answers to the questions a boy wonders about .

There 's a word that 's filled with fun and adventure for every real boy ! " And the graphics and typeface are out of the early Sixties ? except that some of the scout faces are blackened in . On the frontispiece is a photo of the author : " William ' Green Bar Bill ' Hillcourt , Author , Naturalist , and World Scouter , " an old man pictured in a Boy Scout uniform , complete with short pants , knee socks , and neckerchief . The frontispiece also declares the Boy Scouts to be " four million strong for America .

In the three years since it has been out ( data on 1982 are not yet available ) , BSA has not only reversed its decline , but has brought its numbers steadily back up each year , to a total of 3,246,000 . Where careers have failed , the romance of old-style Baden-Powellism has succeeded . Tales of heroism and duty have sold a lot of kids on scouting in the past couple of years . As far as numbers are concerned , there ca n't be much question about which of the two scoutings took the right programmatic direction . BUT the numbers are n't all ? or even the most important part ? of what 's disappointing in the new Girl Scouting . A far more significant disappointment is the character of the changes . For although GSUSA clearly had to modernize ( every organization needs to catch up , occasionally , with changing times ) , it modernized wrongly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spirit . Some may say that today 's Boy Scouting has its objectionable aspects , but everyone will agree that it is firmly , recognizably Boy Scouting . The new Girl Scouting , on the other hand , mirrors the conventional wisdom , and so looks just like everything else . To begin to look like everything else is to lose one 's own spirit . At one point , the late Mrs. Low expressed the hope that " We will make scouting so much a part of the American life that people will recognize the spirit and say , ' Why of course . She is a Girl Scout . ' " Sorry , Mrs. Low .
