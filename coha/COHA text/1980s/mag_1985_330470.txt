Six miles high , flying through the midnight sky in his white , Israeli-made jet , the inexhaustible Reverend Jerry Falwell was on his way to Boston , scheduled to appear the following morning on a television show . During the trip , however , an urgent telephone message arrived : there was a suicide emergency at Falwell 's center for alcoholics in Lynchburg , Va . A distraught veteran was threatening to blow his head off with a loaded pistol unless Falwell came back and talked to him . The would-be suicide was put on the phone , and , slick as butter , the Reverend began to calm him . Falwell explained , as one reasonable person to another , that he had to be on a national television program . But , Falwell promised , he would certainly be back in Virginia by 6 o'clock that evening . The veteran agreed to wait . Falwell did his show , flew home , met the upset man and converted him to Christ . <P> Obviously , it takes a lot to deflect Jerry Falwell from broadcasting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vast Fundamentalist empire . And yet there is something shockingly worldly about his endless selling . What are we to make of this fatherly Bible banger , this artful entrepreneur in rube 's clothing who sups with Presidents and world leaders , and reaches out directly to the simplest of men and women ? His earnest warnings about America 's moral decay , the breakdown of family values , are instinctively appealing . Is he , as his followers proclaim , the truest and bravest voice in the whole Fundamentalist movement , crying out against the rising tide of sin and sleaze ? Or is he , with his swift mind and glib tongue , a modern Elmer Gantry , a power preacher with a corrupt soul ? <P> Falwell is the most effective  --  and maybe because of his tremendous impact , the most unnerving  --  of the nation 's video preachers . His is a spectacularly risky mission . He must on the one hand reassure his zealous followers that he is faithful to the fierce absolutes of the Bible . At the same time , he must appear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Falwell : " We want to be part of society without endorsing all the philosophies and life-styles of that society . " <P> Just to keep going , Falwell must raise $100 million a year , promoting religion with all his corporate daring and guile . His Thomas Road Church in Lynchburg is the cockpit of the whole enterprise . Jammed with TV directors and monitoring screens , it is where Falwell tapes his Sunday-morning service , which is broadcast that evening as the Old Time Gospel Hour to 392 stations across the country . A bank of 62 telephone operators takes incoming pledges after the show . <P> Beyond Lynchburg , reaching into all 50 states , is Falwell 's most controversial venture , Moral Majority , a lobbying and political-action group that claims 6.5 million members . Falwell started Moral Majority in 1979 , thrusting the religious right into front-line politics . The way Falwell saw it , if liberal clergymen could march for civil rights , conservative Fundamentalists could wage political war on immorality . Moral Majority espoused an odd ecumenism that aligned Falwell on various issues with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past by strict Fundamentalists .
