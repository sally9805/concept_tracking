It was the biggest plane order in the history of commercial aviation , a $5 billion deal to buy 100 Boeing jets and 30 Airbus models by 1995 . The purchaser was not one of the titans of the airline business but a 16-employee Beverly Hills-based concern known as International Lease Finance Corp . Founded in 1973 by Steven Udvar-Hazy , 42 , and Louis Gonda , 39 , with financial help from Gonda 's father Leslie , 68 , the company has become one of the biggest players in the burgeoning business of jet leasing , with earnings of $51 million last year on revenues of $180 million . ILFC borrows money to buy jets and then leases them to airlines , which like the arrangement because it leaves them more money to spend on operations and service instead of expensive equipment . The company currently leases 53 jets for as much as $1 million a month . <P> ILFC 's mammoth order is an enormous boon to Boeing , which has been reeling from a spate of bad publicity . An Aloha Airlines Boeing 737 ripped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have voiced concerns about quality control on production of the Seattle-based company 's 747 and 767 models . ILFC ordered 78 737s , nine 757s , nine 767s and four 747s for $3.7 billion . Europe 's Airbus , which has been making inroads in the U.S. market , expressed satisfaction with its $1.3 billion share of the ILFC contract . The only real loser was St. Louis-based McDonnell Douglas . It too bid for the order , but came away with nothing .
