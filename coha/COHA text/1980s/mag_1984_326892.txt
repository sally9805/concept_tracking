The Supreme Court rules in favor of Consumers Union <P> It 's time for a feast , " So declared New York Lawyer Floyd Abrams last week after the Supreme Court handed the U.S. press its first major libel victory in more than a decade . The case involved Consumers Union , the publisher of the product-rating magazine Consumer Reports ( estimated circ. 3 million ) . The nonprofit organization had lost a $210,000 libel judgment to Bose Corp. , a Massachusetts electronics manufacturer , for a 1970 article that criticized one of the firm 's loudspeakers . A federal appeals court overturned the award in November 1982 . The Supreme Court upheld that decision by a 6-to-3 vote and in doing so underscored the vital role of appellate courts in reviewing libel actions .

That verdict seemed to threaten all critics whose reviews are less than glowing . Had last week 's Supreme Court decision gone the other way , says William Rice , editor of Food &; Wine magazine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hesitation and soul searching in terms of what we could and should print . " <P> The Justices may have helped discourage arbitrary libel actions against the press by reaffirming the right of appellate judges to conduct their own reviews in such cases . Said Washington Libel Lawyer Bruce Sanford : " This sends a message to libel plaintiffs that they ca n't go out and inflame the antinews bias of jurors and expect the appeals courts to wink . " According to the Libel Defense Resource Center , journalists who are sued for libel lose 83% of jury trials , but win at the appeals level in 70% of the cases .
