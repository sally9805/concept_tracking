Finding a cure for the common cold has been an elusive goal for generations . The reason : there are more than 100 different types of rhinoviruses , the culprits responsible for about half of all colds . Now scientists may have the key to warding off the sniffles . Reporting in the journal Cell last week , two separate research teams announced the discovery of a cell molecule to which rhinoviruses attach themselves . When the cold viruses bind to the molecule , known as the ICAM-1 receptor , they infect the cell . <P> The discovery means that synthetic copies of the molecule might one day be made into a decoy medicine . Sprayed into the nose , the drug could confuse invading rhinoviruses , luring them away from the real cell receptors in the body . Once bound to the synthetic , the viruses could be neutralized and thus prevented from causing colds . But that strategy , which might prevent but probably would not cure an active cold , has thus far worked only in the test tube . Relief is still years away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
