" Pardon the looks of the house , " Mrs. Nason said to the Governor , " but we had a wild party in here last night and we haven ' t had a chance to clean up. " // At Korkey Hendershot ' s house , the ice chunks and raging water burst through the foundation and filled the basement and first floor . The ice has long since been smashed apart and removed , and the house has been braced while three masons rebuild the foundation . Sofa covers were being dried outside , the yard was filled with piles of sodden strips of wall lathing and a portable gas burner was drying out the living room. // Tacked to the front door was a penciled note that read : " You ' ll have to forgive our appearance . We seem to have a mud problem in the neighborhood. " // It has been two weeks since the Delaware surged over its banks and flooded more than 500 two-story homes along the river , many up to second-floor levels , and forced about 3 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their soaked and muddied living rooms and kitchens and crushed cellar foundations in this old mill town , the cleanup and recovery is being fueled by a proud spirit of self-help and independence. // Self-pity and despair are hard to find , and there is little talk of selling and moving to higher ground . The dominant mood is one of cooperation - everybody helping everybody else dig out and clean up. // " They ' re scrubbing and cleaning and tearing off walls and floors , " said one carpenter outside a damaged corner grocery . " I ' ve seen women down there in the mud , cleaning out cellars and working harder than the men sometimes , carrying blocks and everything. " // Loans of up to $50 , 000 at 3 percent interest are now available to owners of flood-damaged homes from the Federal Small Business Administration , which will take applications until April 17 here and in Matamoras , another hard-hit town just across the Delaware in Pennsylvania . But many residents say they have little spare cash to cover heavy repair costs and are looking to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all kinds of money to countries overseas for fixing this and that free - gratis - and we ain ' t getting nothing ; I don ' t understand it , " said William Dailey , an elderly man whose home was inundated with six feet of water , rotting several walls. // Mayor E. Arthur Gray , a funeral director now in his second two-year term , put flood-damage and cleanup costs at $7 million . Losses are being itemized now for a request to President Reagan to declare Port Jervis a disaster area , eligible for grants. // " For us , $7 million is devastation , " the Mayor said . " I don ' t know how we can get back through the tax base . If we don ' t get help here , we ' re going to fall between the cracks. " // Port Jervis is a blue-collar factory town of 8 , 500 built by John B. Jervis , an engineer , between Kingston , N.Y. , and the Pennsylvania coal mines as a port on the Delaware and Hudson Canal . It flourished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late in that century until about 1950 as a key railroad terminal , with cattle yards and train-repair and machine shops , on the New York-Chicago run of the old Erie Railroad . But the canal is long dead , the railroad is barely a shadow of its past and jobs are scarce. // City Hall has a $1 million plan to build five new buildings downtown and refurbish six others , and city officials hope to inspire private capital to restore the old train station , now a littered home for pigeons . The goal is to attract summer tourists , canoeists and backpackers , once a proposed national recreation park on the Delaware takes shape . But these long-range plans are of no immediate value to the flood-stricken , who appear to be among the town ' s poorest people. // Residents are proud , tough and churchgoing . They hunt in the surrounding hills for deer , and sometimes bear and turkey . They are faithful to the high school ' s state-champion wrestling team and its undefeated football team. // Most work in factories that produce bathing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , cleansers , cosmetics and baked goods , at two local hospitals and a nearby state psychiatric facility , and at a Federal prison outside town . Unemployment still hovers around 12 percent and about 3 , 000 people live solely on Social Security checks , according to the Mayor. // Perhaps the most heavily damaged building here was Flo-Jean , a popular landmark restaurant on the riverbank that was patronized by travelers during the railroad ' s heyday. // Some big slabs of ice pushed in the foundation and undermined parts of the restaurant , which was left tilting toward the river , and a wall of chunks about 30 feet high is lodged on the riverbank next to the building . The big fireplace in the lobby has been torn out to remove weight that might have toppled the restaurant as the ice under it melts. // The owner , Florence Dalrymple , an octogenarian universally described as spirited and determined , wants to rebuild the restaurant and has entrusted the job to Michael Hunt , a local contractor. // " We ' ve got to try to save @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It ' s her whole life. " // The Delaware is usually a friend to the people , who fish it in the spring for shad and trout and in the summer welcome touring canoeists who spend time and money in the town ' s restaurants and bars. // Occasionally , the river becomes an enemy . A big flood much like the one earlier this month struck on St. Patrick ' s Day in 1875 . In both , a fall and winter of minimal rain had drastically reduced the river ' s flow , causing it to freeze solid in sub-zero temperatures . Heavy rain and a big thaw then broke the ice into thousands of chunks that jammed at river bends , creating artificial dams that clogged the river and triggered flash spillovers. // The 1875 flood hit in daylight . This month ' s flood struck about 3 A.M. after ice slabs had apparently jammed about midnight at a curve and an island about three miles downriver near a roadside hot-dog stand that everybody calls the Thirsty Deer. // " The water rose here by about eight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gray said . " That ' s what devastated us . " Port Jervis was also awash in a big flood in August 1955 , he added , " but nothing was worse than this one. " // The flood revived memories of old Bill Marvins , a hermit who lived alone during the Depression years in a shanty on an island at a riverbend near the cemetery , with a cow and some gardens . During spring floods , he was said to have taken refuge in a hut he had built in the only tree on the island , hoisting the cow above the flood waters with a pulley rigged in the tree. // " I ' m told he survived a lot of floods that way , " said Michael Ross , a 32-year-old city worker whose boyhood home overlooks what is now called Marvins ' s Island . " But they took him off the island after the ' 35 flood . They brought him over to the firehouse and gave him a bath , and he died not long after that of exposure or pneumonia. " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ riverbanks near the island were leveled by the water and ice or knocked askew and left tilting downriver , but Mr. Marvins ' s tree survived ramrod straight. //
