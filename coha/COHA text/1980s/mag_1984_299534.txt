The U.S. and Iraq renew ties <P> To Iraq , the U.S. was the worst of imperialists , a country run by Zionists and hypocrites . To Washington , Iraq was an international menace , second only to Libya as a haven for terrorists . Yet despite the two governments ' name-calling and mutual suspicion throughout the 1970s , a tentative courtship between the Reagan Administration and the regime of Saddam Hussein has been quietly blossoming in recent years .

When pilots for the fighters have been trained , Iraq is expected to step up its attacks on ships departing from Iran 's main oil terminal at Kharg Island .
