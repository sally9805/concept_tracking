Anger over $1.6 billion <P> Clarence Murphy , 35 , a Michigan trucker who hauls cars for the auto industry and has been periodically out of work for much of this year as a result of the nationwide slowdown in car sales , had a question for Jimmy Carter at a campaign town meeting earlier this month in Flint . Why is it , he asked , that the Federal Government gives generous unemployment retraining and compensation benefits to autoworkers who lose their jobs because of rising imports , while other workers , like himself , who are being laid off because of the same auto-industry slump get nothing ? Carter eventually invited Murphy to the White House to explain that including workers like him in the program was simply " too costly . " Both the question and the answer highlighted the inequities that abound in one of Washington 's most confusing and costly unemployment programs , the so-called Trade Adjustment Assistance , or TAA . <P> Some 520,000 workers currently qualify for the federal payments as part of the TAA program . These payments can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 18 months . Started in 1962 , TAA initially gave a cash payment to any worker who lost his job as a direct result of U.S. Government trade concessions that led to an increase in foreign imports . In 1974 Congress substantially relaxed the qualifications for recipients and boosted the size of the aid . <P> The beneficiaries of TAA range all the way from coal and textile workers to shoemakers and electronics-industry workers . But most attention is now focused on the nation 's recession-ravaged steelworkers and autoworkers . American steelmen began qualifying for benefits in large numbers when foreign steel started pouring into the U.S. in the mid-1970s . More recently , the Labor Department has been ruling that rising automobile imports are hurting U.S. carmakers , thus opening the way for claims from laid-off autoworkers . In Michigan alone , some 150,000 autoworkers have already filed for benefits , while perhaps 220,000 more have applied from elsewhere around the country . <P> Yet workers like Murphy , who have been laid off by firms indirectly affected by the rise in imports , can not qualify for aid . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ McMillan , a seven-year veteran of the McLouth Steel plant outside Detroit , which supplies sheet metal to the auto industry , was let go by his employer on March 11 , but he has been unable to qualify for TAA benefits . Reason : even though a steelman , who thus might have qualified if foreign imported steel had hurt his company , McMillan lost his job because of imported cars instead . Complains his wife bitterly : " The denial of benefits stinks . As far as I 'm concerned , we have just as much right to the money as the autoworkers . After all , the cars get made out of steel , do n't they ? " <P> A bill now in Congress would broaden the program to include the whole panoply of suppliers whose workers do not currently qualify for assistance . The measure would add perhaps as much as $1.2 billion annually to a program that is already racing out of control . In the past twelve months , expenditures have leaped from $259 million to $1.6 billion .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
