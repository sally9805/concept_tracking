txt I was once watching a friend fiddle around with the wiring on his stereo set . He did n't know much of anything about electrical circuitry and somehow managed to cross the bare wires running from the receiver to a speaker . A very small sound ? ping  --  came out of the speaker , and we learned later that this was the sound of an amplifier dying . The lesson was that although one wire looked like another to the untrained eye , each carried different loads . and if you crossed them something at the other end would probably go kapow . This is by way of explaining that along about 11:20 p.m. on Hostage Inauguration On Television Day , I 'm pretty sure that an amplifier blew out in the brain of this TV viewer . I was watching a local newscast on WABC-TV. and a reporter , for the station was at one of the " regional " Inaugural balls at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel in New York , where he was asking people how they felt about the hostage release . Finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Does everyone feel better about being an American tonight ! " Everybody cheered and the reporter smiled and said , " Back to you , Ernie . " And Ernie Anastos , the WABC anchorman , said , " Gee it 's nice to have a lot of good news for once . " Ping . January 20. 1981 , was a day wired for high-voltage joy in the U.S. Joy over the inauguration of a President and joy over the release of the 52 American hostages held by Iran . But it seems to me that the quality of joy found in these two events was of quite different kinds . The joy of a presidential inauguration is , for the victors , a joy born of pure happiness . The joy found in the release of the hostages is colored by a more complex tincture of emotions . The hostages are passing into the free life of America after some 15 humiliating months for them and their country . But however different the quality of joy that day , the television medium is not able to be overly fastidious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and bedrooms . When it wants to , television can convey the world 's news from minute to minute , transmitting whatever emotions happen to be pouring in from Tehran , Algiers , the Oval Office or the West Front of the U.S. Capitol . Consider . for instance , the emotional content of this viewer 's off-and-on time before the television on Tuesday . One saw reports on the last desperate hours of the Carter White House attempting to lock up the hostage deal . Mr. Reagan and Mr. Carter depart the White House together , one high with anticipation , the other crushed . Walking onto the inaugural platform , one hears Mr. Carter say " Not yet , " when asked ? if the hostages ' plane has taken off . Mr. Reagan is sworn in and delivers his inaugural speech . One learns early in the afternoon that the plane is out of Iran . The local New York newscasts are saturated with arrival preparations in Wiesbaden , Germany . The evening network news programs open with the hostage news , and with videotape of Jimmy Carter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Office , followed by a clip of President Reagan at a luncheon calling the hostages " prisoners , " followed by Reagan sitting at an empty desk in the Oval Office , followed by NBC 's 75-second clip of Mr. Reagan 's 19-minute inaugural speech , followed by NBC 's Tom Pettit with a collage of images from the day so far . In the middle of the evening , television provides one of those truly eerie experiences it seems to specialize in . There are shots of a lone 727 landing on the glistening wet runway of an airport in Algiers . The scene is bathed in  --  scarlet lights , except when the transmission occasionally breaks down the color into sickly magentas and greens . The hostages sit down in a lounge and endure a strage little ceremony with the Algerians . They leave for Germany . The evening really gets cranked up when the networks return at 11:30 . Now they have to report not only the news of the previous 12 hours but the inaugural balls as well . So : At 11:45 ABC is broadcasting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their relatives on screen . One is struck not only by their joy but by the white intensity of the TV lights that suffuse each living room . We are sitting home watching them watch television , and television itself , in the person of camera crews , is standing around in their living rooms , recording the pictures we are seeing of the families . Then I saw Barbara Walters in a beautiful pink dress embroidered with white lace interviewing someone whose face was on a big TV screen in front of Barbara . And then I saw Ronald Reagan at one of the balls say , " I wo n't call them hostages : they were prisoners of war . " And then someone said the lights on the capital 's Christmas tree had been turned on , and the network showed not only the tree but the light on the Statue of Liberty . Suddenly the screen filled with the most beautiful woman in the world , who was wearing a shiny cream-colored dress and who was standing next to the President . And then I saw the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living room full of more white television light and white champagne foam and a little girl in an orange shirt who was crying . And then I saw a woman on NBC interviewing Roy Rogers and Dale Evans . Roy Rogers and Dale Evans ! And the last thing Dale Evans said to the reporter was , " God bless you . " Then NBC was in Detroit interviewing a hostage wife named Mattie Brown . I switched to ABC , and there , with the 52 hostages sitting in a plane in the sky somewhere over Germany . I saw Sally Quinn , who is a reporter for the Washington Post , tell Barbara Walters that one thing Nancy Reagan would have to learn is that it is no longer possible to be just the President 's wife , that she would have to find a cause with which she could display " a social conscience . " Ping . I guess we will have to learn to live with this , with having our formerly discrete emotional experiences twisted together like so much telephone cable . I do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scary or just giddy fun . For now , perhaps we had better settle for what Mr. Cronkite tells us . That 's the way it is.
