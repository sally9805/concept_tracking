Slick new computerized automation will transform office work beyond our wildest dreams ; the ranks of computerized robots marching into American factories will swell dramatically ; computerized teleconferencing will turn the everyday business meeting into a whole new ball game. // But where will we humans be left in all the techno-flurry ? // Enter Harley Shaiken and the human-factor researchers . They are sounding some warnings about the American work-place . The same galloping computer revolution that promises leaps in productivity , they say , could also stampede the American dream for millions : // // * Computer and robot technologies are creating new jobs for thousands of people , but they ' re also putting additional thousands out of work . When - if ever - will high technology open up enough new jobs to absorb the displaced ? // // * Automation is taking over routine manual tasks that once burdened millions of clerical workers . But millions of other workers are being relegated to stifling , equally boring work at computer terminals. // // * Teleconferencing - the staging of business meetings over long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ millions of dollars in travel costs . But it could also give the powerful and the photogenic sweeping new advantages. // In the face of such prospects , even a cool-reasoning researcher like Mr. Shaiken finds himself slipping on the prophetic mantle and booming out high-tech jeremiads. // ' ' Surely we can not just blindly rush these robots into our factories , automate our offices , reorganize management globally with teleconferencing , and only then start to ask how people will be affected , ' ' he says , sitting in his tidy office at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology ( MIT ) . // ' ' We need a full-scale national debate to ensure that the new machine wave supports a brighter future for people , not the other way around. ' ' // The debate has well-nigh begun . To wrestle with new quandaries of the human-computer interface , a new breed of research has sprung into being . ' ' Human-factor research , ' ' it ' s called in high-tech cathedrals like MIT . In the past , the vogue might have been ' ' computer-factor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is our assumption that computerization is here and that what needs attention is not the machines , but the humans who run them. // Established computer manufacturers like Wang Laboratories Inc. and Digital Equipment Corporation now have percolating new centers for human-factor research where social scientists with PhDs search for ways to make machines more ' ' user friendly. ' ' // But the critical outcome of the human-computer encounter will be decided in the workplace itself . Will average working people , the researchers ask , get a say in how the new systems will transform their working lives ? Will they be given the chance to train for a satisfying place in the high-tech sun ? This reporter visited several places where the human-computer interface issues are surfacing with force : // // * // * // * Newark , Del . A long steel accordionlike arm reaches out from a rotating turret , halts , dips , swings its swiveling metallic wrist into position alongside a car-body skeleton . Clamping its steel fingers on the roof line , it delivers a loving pinch of soldering fire , sending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ machine-perfect spot weld. // ' ' Some robot ! ' ' an onlooker exclaims. // Meanwhile , on the receiving end of the sparks , welder Jerry Hammer is not so impressed . A skilled CO2 arc welder who works nearby , he ' s been keeping a cautious eye on his robotic counterpart here on Chrysler ' s factory floor for two years. // ' ' I don ' t really feel threatened , ' ' he says . ' ' Automation ' s coming , and there ' s nothing you can do about it. ' ' // ' ' But , ' ' he adds uneasily , ' ' I guess someday they ' ll find robots to do my welding , too. ' ' // In fact , the small crew of robots at Chrysler ' s Newark plant - 67 of them - is already doing the work that 800 humans could do , says Joe Games , the local head of the United Auto Workers . The worker-robot tradeoff looks even more awesome when you consider that nearly 6 , 000 of the mechanical beasts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Obviously , unless we balance this robot influx with more favorable prospects for the people around them , we ' re going to have severe problems down the road , ' ' says Mr. Shaiken , the MIT specialist. // The difficulties are compounded by the fact that robots are not only doing humans out of jobs ; they are doing it at a time when business is bad. // When economic times were good , other jobs could easily be found for people displaced by automation . It isn ' t so easy in today ' s sluggish economy . And the pressures keep mounting on industry to stretch profits through automating even more. // US industries are planning massive new recruitment of robots to withstand competition from abroad - notably from the Japanese . The latest competitive gauntlet to be thrown down is the slick new 220-robot Nissan auto assembly plant in Smyrna , Tenn . By 1990 , General Motors alone is expected to multiply its own 1 , 600-robot force at least 10 times. // So far , the automobile industry - which boasts half of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strains . When Chrysler-Newark planned the installation of its 67 robots , for instance , it thought ahead . It assigned robots only to the nastier welding jobs . It created new jobs to install the robots , hiring previously laid-off workers on short-term contracts . With the robots in place , those workers were let go again - and with no complaint . Some new robot-supervising jobs were even created. // But in the long run , that kind of strategy may not work . A far bigger robot invasion is expected in the next decade . Jobs lost could far exceed jobs created , at least for the time being . Ironically , the United States could be hit with a shortage of computer-savvy workers at the same time . The only way to avoid major social dislocations and protest may be a major collaboration on the issue among workers , managers , and university researchers. // One such effort is being promoted by Danny Hoffman , the editor of the newspaper of UAW local 735 near Detroit. // Another has been started by the 1-million-member International Association of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bill of Rights , ' ' which it hopes to push through Congress next year . Robotics and other high-technologies , the bill says , should be used not only to benefit industry , but also to create and maintain jobs . Rather than decrease the number of jobs , workers should be allowed to work fewer hours for the same pay , it says. // Whatever the fate of the bill , it seems likely that robot-enlisting companies will face growing pressure from the human-factor researchers to justify their enlistments on more grounds than just the need for efficiency. // ' ' The mechanical beasties do have their place , for they can relieve people of terribly undignified jobs , ' ' says Thomas Sheridan , an MIT professor of mechanical engineering . ' ' But real hands are wonderful things . I don ' t want to see them retired too hastily . ' ' <> Hartford , Conn. // Julia Hughes used to dread certain meetings . As an analyst here at the Aetna Insurance Company , she had to shuttle 10 miles to a branch office in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there. // Then teleconferencing walked into her life. // Aetna installed conference rooms with cameras and color TV screens at both sites to bring the staffs at Hartford and Windsor into full view of each other . Elaborate two-way sound systems allow people in the conference rooms to talk easily to each other . A second screen lets each staff member examine charts. // The only thing missing is something Mrs. Hughes is perfectly happy to do without : the time-wasting , dollar-devouring travel. // Once the privileged toy of top executives , teleconferencing ( TC ) is now spreading throughout the corporate ranks . It could transform the entire ' ' game ' ' by which Americans negotiate and organize their businesses . And game players , warn the researchers , will need to prep themselves on what those changes mean - or be left sitting on the bench. // Companies like Allstate , Citibank , and Atlantic Richfield are drawn to TC not just for its convenience , but also to save mammoth travel costs . ( Atlantic Richfield , which spends well over $1 million a week on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between offices linked by TC. ) // As TC systems go , Aetna ' s video/two-way audio system is quite plush . At the other extreme , are the simple systems that allow people sitting at computer terminals to exchange messages , but not images . Most companies buying TC equipment will probably opt for something in between - especially the one-way video/two-way audio systems , says Martin Elton of New York University ' s Alternative Media Center. // The Bell System has been quietly preparing its nationwide Picturephone Meeting Service ( PMS ) . The New York-Washington connection got going this summer . By year ' s end , 15 cities will be linked up , over 40 cities next year . ( Current cost : $730 a half-hour for a PMS conference between New York and Washington. ) // But what exactly will it all mean for American business ? // For one thing , say the human-factor researchers , TC is going to make possible many meetings that were once thought out of the question. // ' ' Even the thought of having to waste five minutes walking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many face-to-face discussions - but not anymore , ' ' says Wang ' s Vernell Munson , whose Advanced System Laboratory installed intra-office TC. // Once people grow familiar with TC , even high-stake negotiations may be conducted using it . However , some corporate and government negotiators rely heavily on noting every facial twitch of their counterparts . They may hesitate about TC for some time . Indeed , Bell ' s PMS system was used in trial runs mostly to exchange ideas , not for hard negotiation , reports Telespan , the monthly teleconferencing newsletter published in Altadena , Calif. // Said one Aetna executive : ' ' When I pound on the table , I want it to be felt ! ' ' // But we ' re in for the big changes in the gamesmanship by which corporations reach decisions , if you ask Prof. William Dutton of the University of Southern California. // Executives who once communicated with lower ranks only through middle-level managers , may now begin to bypass the middle group altogether , he says . Instead of gathering around the same board table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' by means of TV cameras and microphones their company directors , who sit at different locations. // The day may not be far off , Mr. Dutton suggests , when executives skilled in pointing cameras and microphones by remote control could manage the outcome of meetings. // ' ' When the telephone was first invented , people thought it would be used mainly to transmit music , ' ' Mr. Dutton says . ' ' Teleconferencing is another of those amazingly versatile tools where people will use their imaginations and do all kinds of things we don ' t expect . ' ' <> Lowell , Mass. // As the secretary for one of Wang Laboratories top executives , Josie Di Pietro does her work on one of the most futuristic office systems yet designed by the company. // She still takes dictation , but no longer by hand . She still types her boss ' s letters , but she doesn ' t need to spend time typing draft after draft. // The reason : She and her boss are able to collaborate on their joint computer work station @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listens to what he has dictated into a system telephone , and types the message directly into the system ' s word processor . He types final changes into his computer keyboard . The system automatically prints out a final draft , and , by the push of a button , Mrs. Di Pietro ' ' files ' ' a copy in the instant-recall computer memory . ( Metal filing cabinets for paper are veritable dinosaurs in this office. ) // ' ' Though I ' m doing less professional typing , my work is totally exciting - always new skills to learn , ' ' says this satisfied , if partial , customer. // Far less enthusiastic , however , is Joan Quinlin , formerly Boston director of 9 to 5 , Organization for Women Office Workers. // Thousands of lower-level secretaries and clerical workers have not been so blessed by the computer revolution , she says . These workers , particularly those in banks and insurance companies , are being stationed in impersonal pools of bleary-eyed , terminal-gazing typists performing endlessly repetitive tasks , she says . Often they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supervised by the very machines they operate. // One 1979 study conducted in San Francisco by the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health concluded that workers using video-display terminals showed more stress than any other type of worker the institute studied , including air-traffic controllers. // ' ' The office of today could turn into the factory of yesterday , ' ' Ms. Quinlin says . ' ' We think technology can be used more creatively to make jobs more interesting and diversify workers ' skills . ' ' The concern should intensify in the years ahead , given the coming boom in office-automation sales. // An estimated 10 million of the nation ' s 50 million office workers now use video-display terminals ; one third of all office workers will use them by 1985 . Office automation , now a $4-billion-a-year industry , is expected to be a whopping $19-billion-a-year industry by 1995 , according to Predicasts of Cleveland , a consulting firm that follows trends in high-tech industry. // Yet one incredulous salesman at Wang Laboratories says that , with but one exception , all the companies that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so without studying how the new system would mesh ( or not mesh ) with existing machinery and the needs of their employees. // The key to making office-automation planning work , says Stanford researcher Bonnie Johnson , lies in how company planners see their employees. // ' ' If planners assume that technology is reliable , but people are unreliable , needing to be controlled , the new high-tech office systems will prove to be domineering and stifling to human potential , ' ' she says . ' ' But productivity can be enhanced enormously when systems are planned and purchased to fit office workers ' needs and office workers encouraged to participate in the planning process. ' ' // One showpiece extolled by the 9 to 5 group is the planning of the East African Division of the World Bank in Washington . It set up a ' ' quality of work life ' ' committee composed of clerical , secretarial , and managerial representatives . In the process , management discovered to its surprise that a system of office automation entirely different from the one originally planned was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their delight , a varied schedule for rotating on equipment , taking work breaks , and training for new tasks. // ' ' When it comes to bringing high-tech machines into the workplace , we ' re learning that we can no longer define a ' Cadillac ' merely in terms of the newest , the biggest , or the most expensive , ' ' says Christine Bullen , assistant director of MIT ' s Center for Information Systems Research. // ' ' The real payoffs - both for workers and companies - now depend on whether the systems they get have the right qualities for the people and purposes of the workplace they enter . Human-factor planning is the new rule. ' ' // //
