Inflation-battered and recession-weary buyers return slowly to stores <P> The consumer carries the U.S. economy on his back . He accounts for two-thirds of America 's gross national product ; and during last fall and winter , he fueled the longest peacetime period of economic expansion in modern times by buying goods that he knew would only cost more next month . This attitude has proved to be right on target . In July , the prices paid by wholesalers rose 1.7% or at a yearly rate of 22.4% . But by the beginning of 1980 , consumer spending was slowing down , and when the Federal Reserve Board tightened credit in March , the public put away its plastic . As a consequence , the economy fell hard . Retail sales , which had started to soften in January , plummeted for the next four months by $4.9 billion .

The monthly survey of 5,000 households had been declining steadily since November 1979 , and it hit bottom in May , when only 42.1% felt optimistic about current business conditions and the future of the economy . But Fabian Linden , the director of the survey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprising increase in consumer spirits beginning in June , and that was repeated more dramatically in July . " In those two months , the index spurted 16 points , to 58.1% . <P> Though July is not normally a strong month for merchants , a number of the bigger retailers managed to ring up good sales on selected items . Unusually hot summer weather had Sears , Roebuck and Co. customers in Chicago snapping up air conditioners and fans . At Macy 's in New York City last week , business was brisk in men 's clothing and home electronics .
