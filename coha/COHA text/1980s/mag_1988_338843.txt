KATIE DAVIS ENJOYS READING stories about kids who are a few years older than she is . As school ended for the summer , she started Lizard Music by D. Manus Pinkwater . " I love it , " Katie says enthusiastically . " It 's about a boy who is twelve . He 's remembering last summer when he was eleven and his parents were away . He 's left with his sister , but then his sister goes away for the weekend with these hippies at a camp . I do n't know yet how it ends but maybe , because of the title , the boy will meet a lizard that makes music with a flute . " <P> An imaginative world of fantasy complements the otherwise complicated and often hectic pace of Katie Davis ' life . Much like the boy in Lizard Music , Katie will be spending the summer hanging out with her half-sister Mona Wessels , 16 . " It was weird when Mona came to live with us , " says Katie . " It was like a new person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone from your family who does n't live there into your family again . It 's a funny feeling . It 's nice but it 's kinda weird . " <P> Katie is the only child of Bruce and Mary Davis . He is a doctor , and she is a family nurse practitioner . Both work at Seattle 's Group Health Cooperative . Mona is Mary 's daughter by a previous marriage . Two years ago , Mona moved out of her father 's house and settled in with the Davises , as had her older brother Jason , 17 , a few years earlier . <P> Now Katie and Mona spend a lot of time together . Before school let out for the summer , Katie was sometimes picked up by her sister from an after-school day-care program and walked home . This summer Mona and Katie will take field trips around Seattle while the Davises work . Katie and Mona will travel to the zoo or the aquarium or the science center on city buses . Or because they share a passion for reading , they will walk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mona teaches me all this stuff , " says Katie , who asks Mona to dress her up like Madonna , or mousse her hair to make her look like a punk rocker . " I mean , I probably am not going to have cigarettes when I grow up because Mona says she was really addicted to them and it was hard for her to quit , " says Katie . " She 'll beat me up if I ever smoke a cigarette . " <P> Katie is an energetic , bubbly girl with sunny , shoulder-length blond hair and blue eyes that shine from behind jet-black eyelashes . Last year she wrote and illustrated a book ( one copy in circulation so far ) with the tongue- twisting title Xavier Xanax Excitedly Xeroxes X-Mas Xylophones and X-Rays in Xanadu . It is subtitled A World Alphabet Book , and all 26 letters receive similar treatment . In a blurb about the author , she writes , " Katie Davis lives in Seattle , Washington , in a house of five . And whenever she gets lonely she just goes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . and a lot of times her friends get in fights so she has to make them friends again . She has gone to many places like Disneyland and Disney World . " <P> Katie is a day-care child . To her generation of children , day care is as familiar a destination as Disneyland , if not nearly as magical . During the fall , winter and spring , Katie goes to day care before and after school each day . Because of Mona 's presence , Katie has had a brief reprieve . Says she : " I used to go to day care all summer . I did n't look forward to summer then . "
