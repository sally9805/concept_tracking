With Jews as their targets , urban guerrillas flourish in Paris <P> The assault was not only brutal and ugly ; it was the latest symptom of what seemed to be a spreading and malignant disease . The two gunmen who burst into Paris ' most famous Jewish restaurant last week , spraying lunchtime patrons of Jo Goldenberg 's with submachine-gun fire before escaping , left more than just six people dead and 22 injured in their wake . The close-knit Parisian Jewish community reacted with rage , fearing that the attack presaged a new wave of anti-Semitic violence in Europe . The attacks were also part of a general war in Paris that suggested that the City of Light had become an urban oasis of terrorism . <P> Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin bitterly proclaimed that " once again the cry is heard in the streets of Paris , ' Death to the Jews ! ' " deliberately stirring images of anti-Semitic incidents at the time of Jewish Army Officer Alfred Dreyfus ' trial in the 1890s . Begin even indirectly accused President Franois Mitterrand of helping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attack . Begin charged that the massacre resulted from " the shocking talk and anti-Israeli incitement which has become like anti-Jewish incitement . " The Prime Minister was referring to a remark by Mitterrand comparing the aggressive Israeli attacks on the P.L.O . with Nazi atrocities during World War II . <P> When the French President attended a memorial service for the victims of last week 's shootings , Jewish demonstrators shouted , " Mitterrand is a traitor ! " Deeply affected , Mitterrand said after the service , " I have always been a friend of the Jewish community of France . " <P> In his anger with France , Begin went so far as to question the propriety of having the country 's troops take part in any peace-keeping force in Lebanon . Begin also called for young Jews in France to guard their neighborhoods if the police did not . But his plea was rejected by the religious leaders of the 700,000-member Jewish community in France , the fourth largest in the world . Said Chief Rabbi of France Ren Samuel Sirat : " The sole responsibility of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state and the police . " <P> The Goldenberg 's massacre was one of six anti-Jewish attacks in 14 days in Paris . The others , which wounded only one person , were directed against the automobile of an Israeli embassy employee , a Jewish hardware store in the Marais , a bank formerly owned by the Rothschilds , a firm that imports fruit from Israel and a small house of worship . <P> Responsibility for three of the minor attacks was claimed by Direct Action , a small group of anarchists . No one assumed the responsibility for the shooting at Goldenberg 's , but police suspect it was the work of Black June , a dissident Palestinian group . Yet the escalation of terrorist attacks in France is not limited to anti-Jewish violence . Two days after the Goldenberg 's massacre , two bombs , one on the Champs-Elyses and one at the Iraqi embassy , injured six people . Since May , terrorist attacks of all kinds in Paris have killed 20 and wounded 140.              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
