" Four down , five to go , " an exhausted Rosemary Donnelly remarked the other day . While the wealthy summer people are still at home in New York , Philadelphia and other cities in the Northeast and Middle West , Mrs. Donnelly is opening their houses , sweeping out the cobwebs , disposing of the occasional dead mouse and washing and ironing the curtains. // The elaborate preparations of Chief Searle , Mrs. Donnelly and others are being mirrored up and down the Eastern Seaboard as beach-town inhabitants from Cape Cod to Maryland ' s Eastern Shore gird for summer. // And while they caution that the weather is the final , unknowable determinant , tourism officials and real estate brokers are predicting a banner season along the beaches of Maryland , Delaware , New Jersey , Connecticut and Massachusetts . <> <> Possible Competition // In high-priced resorts like Martha ' s Vineyard and Long Island ' s Hamptons , some officials and rental agents say the summer business may be hurt by the strong dollar , which is making European vacations appealing and relatively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the market , " Charles Clifford , the executive director of the Martha ' s Vineyard Commission , said of the island off Cape Cod. // But most brokers , especially in family areas like New Jersey ' s unpretentious Long Beach Island , argue that their business will not be harmed. // " I think it ' s going to be a banner year , " said Anne FauntLeRoy , the executive director of the Chamber of Commerce in Ocean City , Md. , whose towering condominiums have earned it the nickname " Little Miami Beach . " " We draw a family crowd , " she said . " Families aren ' t going to Europe . " City people dreaming of sea breezes and languid afternoons on sandy beaches are still worrying over leases on everything from $500-a-week bungalows on Long Beach Island to Hamptons oceanfront mansions that can cost more than $100 , 000 for the season . <> <> Visitors Arrive Earlier // But while the season has always officially begun with Memorial Day weekend , many towns report that visitors are arriving earlier and earlier. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are opening their doors in beach town after beach town . The recent reopening of The Dog House , in Vineyard Haven on Martha ' s Vineyard , was warmly welcomed by a transplanted Long Islander , Matt Young. // " I ' ve already had my first two chili dogs , " said Mr. Young , who had survived another chili-dogless winter on the island . Mr. Young and his partner , Richard Friedman , have reopened their own restaurant in Vineyard Haven , the Ocean Club , which offers cuisine considerably more elegant than chili dogs and is patronized by people like Carly Simon , Mike Wallace and Jacqueline Onassis. // Like the first tour bus in Edgartown , the famous and the powerful will soon begin to reappear at the beach . Calvin Klein will be back on Fire Island , John McEnroe in the Hamptons and Abe Pollin , the owner of the Washington Bullets and Capitals , at Rehoboth Beach in Delaware. // From Washington , from Philadelphia , from New York and Boston , the ritual of the weekend exodus will soon begin despite such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interminable waits to cross bridges and board ferries . <> <> Demand Nearer City // Brokers report record prices and unprecedented demand for rentals along Connecticut ' s Long Island Sound , mainly from Manhattanites . Only a few houses are still to be rented in Fairfield County , with beach cottages about $6 , 500 for July and August. // In another direction from New York , the Hamptons ' beautiful beaches and fast-paced social scene have long made the area a mecca for the rich , the fashionable and the single . But concern is being expressed that some visitors , put off by the escalating prices , may go to Europe instead. // " It ' s a very strong dollar over there , and Hamptons prices keep going up , " said Fritz Mayer , a broker in Bridgehampton . The middle range of rentals , he said , includes houses renting for $10 , 000 to $25 , 000 for the season - Memorial Day to Labor Day. // Rents in the incorporated village of Westhampton Beach have been increasing by about 10 percent each season @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ While January and February were busy months for signing summer leases , Mrs. Randazzo said , business fell in March . " It ' s because of the weather , " she said . " The minute we have decent weekends and it gets warm in the city , people are going to come out in droves. " // The year-round and summer residents of all beach towns jealously guard their chosen place ' s special character , while disparaging those who might prefer a different beach. // " I don ' t think there ' s a home on this island where it matters if you sit down on a sofa in a wet bathing suit , " said Jean Luedtke , a broker in Harvey Cedars , at the northern tip of Long Beach Island . Mrs. Luedtke was pleased when her brother , after a brief flirtation with East Hampton , returned. // " He always came back from East Hampton exhausted , " she said . " Here you leave refreshed.

Her agency offers rentals ranging from two bedroom apartments for $350 a week to a four- or five-bedroom oceanfront house with outdoor Jacuzzi for $3 , 500 a week . <> <> Fewer Long Family Vacations // There used to be more four-week or seasonal family rentals . " Now we ' re seeing that fewer families can take that much time off , " she said. // For Washingtonians , the capital ' s summer humidity has long made the beaches of Maryland and Delaware inviting , despite the three-hour drive over the Chesapeake Bay Bridge and through acres of lush farmland. // The same families return year after year to Rehoboth Beach , with its loblolly pines and its old houses with wraparound porches , swelling the 2 , 000-strong Delaware village to a summer population of 75 , 000. // Rental volume in Rehoboth , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this year , according to Penny Carlisle , a rental agent there .
