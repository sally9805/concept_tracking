The six manacled men showed no emotion as a Shanghai court pronounced them guilty of either raping or molesting 48 women between 1981 and 1984 . As a crowd of 3,000 looked on , three of the gang members were whisked off to the outskirts of the city . There the trio were unceremoniously executed by gunshots to the back of the head . What made the swift justice remarkable was that two of the three were sons of senior Chinese officials . Their deaths were the most dramatic sign yet of Peking 's determination to stamp out rampant nepotism . <P> Traditionally , the children of Chinese leaders have received the best schooling , landed plum jobs and even escaped punishment for criminal behavior . Such favoritism has created widespread bitterness . Two months ago , Politburo Member Hu Qili warned officials and their wayward offspring that the government was prepared to " kill one to teach 100 " a lesson . Last week the People 's Daily , China 's official newspaper , drove home the meaning of the Shanghai trial : " Among the six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some are children of high-ranking officials . The court 's solemn conviction strongly demonstrates the principle that everyone is equal before the law . "
