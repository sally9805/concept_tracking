Richard Darman joins the inner circle <P> Half an hour before Ronald Reagan was scheduled to discuss the nation 's money supply with Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker , the President 's top aides came into the Oval Office to give a last-minute briefing . While Treasury Secretary Donald Regan and White House Chief of Staff James Baker watched approvingly , Richard Darman went over a typed page containing concise answers to six questions that he expected Volcker to pose . Reagan paid close attention to Darman 's script . <P> A lot of people , both inside and out side the Administration , are paying close attention these days to the bright and ambitious Darman , 40 , who had never even met Reagan prior to the 1980 election and who is an anomaly among Reagan 's hard-right constituency . In the shake-out of White House responsibilities created by the departure of Presidential Counsellor Edwin Meese , Reagan 's last ideological soul mate in the West Wing , Darman continued his steady , determined rise into the inner circle . Says Deputy Chief of Staff Michael Deaver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people here . He has made an incredible contribution to this presidency . " <P> Darman is scheduled shortly to move from his quarters in the White House basement to an office just outside Reagan 's . That physical proximity will aid Darman in one of his principal duties , overseeing the day-to-day paper flow to and from the President . <P> The new line-up will also give Darman 's mentor Baker a chance to consolidate the making of policy , which Meese nominally controlled , with political and legislative strategies . For the past three weeks , at Baker 's behest , Darman has coordinated a daily 7:30 breakfast meeting in the White House mess that brought the previously bifurcated realms of the Executive apparatus together on an effective basis for the first time since Reagan took office . As a result of the changes , predicts a senior Administration official , " we 'll be less inclined to go with off-the-wall stuff that can not be implemented . " <P> Darman 's ascendancy is all the more intriguing for his Eastern Establishment background . The oldest child of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a master 's degree in business administration from Harvard and entered Government during the Nixon years under the tutelage of his fellow Brahmin , Elliot Richardson . Darman 's various jobs in five Cabinet departments included a stint at Commerce , where he impressed Baker , then an Assistant Secretary , with his ability to analyze vast tangles of information . Baker chose Darman in 1981 as his assistant , says Press Spokesman Larry Speakes , because the Chief of Staff " regards Dick as brighter than himself or the rest of us put together .
