According to Marxist-Leninist dogma , Soviet workers have no reason to strike because they live in a proletarian paradise . That has not , however , stopped the working masses in the world 's oldest socialist state from occasionally walking out . <P> Last week Moscow decided to drop the ideological baggage and proposed a new law that for the first time would allow the country 's normally docile labor unions , to which more than 90% of all Soviet workers belong , the right to strike . The law is expected to be enacted later this year . <P> The government 's action is partly a result of increased work disruptions under Mikhail Gorbachev 's perestroika . Last year alone brought at least 15 strikes around the country involving factory workers , miners , bus drivers and carpet weavers . Last month even the Leningrad police walked off the beat for 24 hours , demanding better working conditions .
