LONDON  --  The first shot in what is expected to become Britain ' s biggest takeover war came late last year  --  fired , ironically , by the target itself . Now , even before a bid hits the table , the battle is inflaming grudges in the top tiers of British industry , politics and finance , while embroiling some of the biggest companies in France and America . It began Nov. 16 , when Lord Weinstock , managing director of General Electric Co. of Britain and the autocratic baron of the country ' s electronics industry , climbed into bed with West Germany ' s giant Siemens AG to launch a joint bid for a smaller British rival , Plessey Co . Lord Weinstock ' s choice of a foreign partner became the very act that put his own company into play . On that news , teams of investment bankers  --  representing Plessey , GEC ' s unrelated U.S. rival General Electric Co. , and other companies in Europe and the U.S.  --  rushed to devise an assault on GEC itself . Yesterday , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ #6. 5 billion to #8 billion ( $11. 49 billion to $14. 14 billion ) for GEC . They aim to issue a formal statement this week confirming progress toward the bid , and to announce details by Monday , sources involved in the talks said . But the consortium ' s membership was still unsettled late yesterday . The only companies almost certain to be founding members of the bidding consortium , sources said , are Plessey and the French state-owned electronics and defense concern Thomson S.A. , which has received clearance from France ' s industry and finance ministries . British electronics concern STC PLC also is expected to join , although its board , following a protracted meeting yesterday , is still dickering over terms of its participation . " The whole damn thing is very fluid " said a frustrated STC Chairman , Lord Keith of Castleacre , following the board meeting . The negotiations are being organized by Lazard Brothers &; Co . , Plessey ' s investment advisers . The principal wild cards in the pack are GE and American Telephone &; Telegraph Co. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diversified businesses , but any significant American involvement in the bid would spark intense political opposition in Britain , stemming from fears of U.S. dominance of Britain ' s strategically important electronics industry . GE Chairman Jack Welch was in London yesterday for talks with his company ' s advisers , N.M. Rothschild &; Sons Ltd . Sources close to GE said it may await announcement of the Lazard-organized bid before making a move . GE , sources said , is eager to buy control of GEC ' s medical-electronics unit , Picker International Inc. , boosting GE ' s standing as the world leader in the field . It also has its eye on GEC ' s electricity-generating equipment business ; besides expanding its own business , this addition would stymie an earlier GEC deal to form the European Community ' s largest generating-equipment venture with France ' s Cie . Generale d ' Electricite , or CGE . But , aside from concerns about British political opposition , sources said a further complication for GE is that French government clearance for Thomson ' s role in the bid was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ venture with GEC . Consortium members are struggling to arrange a compromise that would allow GE some role in the generating business , without offending French politicians . GE has vacillated on how big a role it wants in the consortium bid  --  torn between wanting a low public profile to avoid riling British politicians , and wanting a big piece of GEC ' s businesses , British industry sources said . Meanwhile , AT &; which covets GEC ' s **28;410;TOOLONG manufacturing holdings , is eager to join the bidding consortium . But some British consortium members fear that involvement of the world ' s biggest **28;440;TOOLONG maker in a GEC takeover would be even more politically explosive in Britain than a GE role . If it succeeds  --  and that ' s an enormous if  --  a takeover of GEC would transform Europe ' s electronics industry . For three years , Europe ' s sprawling telecommunications , computer , electrical engineering and semiconductor businesses has been changing in a series of friendly alliances and joint ventures . But a hostile bid for GEC , an electronics giant and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet of how open Europe ' s doors will be to international takeovers of its major manufacturers . And if regulators don ' t close the doors , it will jolt Europe ' s other industrial giants , once thought impregnable . " The conventional wisdom has always been that for any bid " in sensitive industries such as electronics and defense , only a friendly takeover is possible and then only by a domestic company , says the London-based head of mergers &; acquisitions at a leading U.S. investment bank . But GEC teaming up with Siemens gives foreign bidders " a perfect excuse " to attempt a hostile takeover , the investment banker says . " GEC and Siemens  --  a German company no less  --  can ' t very well turn around now and object " to a foreign bidder . Personalities are playing a bigger-than-usual part in the takeover battle . Lord Weinstock has made many enemies in his more than 40 years at GEC , and a bid for his company smacks of settling old scores . Based on the sketchy details emerging so far , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bid is going to benefit GEC shareholders , rather than just defend the personalities involved , " says analyst James Dodd of Citcorp Scrimgeour Vickers Ltd . Lord Weinstock ' s chief antagonist is Plessey ' s chairman , Sir John Clark . " There have been at least two decades of combat " between the two executives , and " there ' s bound to be an element of personality conflict " in the current takeover fight , says Citicorp ' s Mr. Dodd .
