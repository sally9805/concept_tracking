The day was warm , so the four men sat for a while on the State Department 's eighth-floor balcony , overlooking beds of red and yellow tulips . But the meeting was a good deal less pleasant than the surroundings . Across from West Germany 's Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher and Defense Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg sat a grim-faced American duo : Secretary of State James Baker and Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney . After the four-hour meeting , Baker declared himself " furious " that the Germans had come at all . <P> The nasty falling-out between normally amicable allies was the result of renewed German demands that the U.S. open talks with the Soviet Union on reducing Europe 's short-range nuclear weapons , nearly all of which are deployed on West German soil . At one point , Genscher complained that his country would bear the brunt of a Soviet attack . An exasperated Cheney interrupted Genscher : " Look , if the flag goes up , we 're all going to be obliterated , so we do n't need to hear any of that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down , and last week formally proposed negotiations with Moscow . In the U.S. view , the German demands threaten the entire NATO strategy of nuclear deterrence . For 40 years NATO has relied on nuclear weapons to offset the Warsaw Pact 's overwhelming superiority in conventional arms . The backbone of its land-based tactical nuclear force consists of 88 U.S.-made Lance launchers . <P> West Germans , who are increasingly opposed to such weapons , have become disillusioned with Kohl , who faces elections next year . To help Kohl with his political problems , the U.S. agreed to delay a decision on deploying an updated , longer-range Lance ( up to 280 miles ) . In return , U.S. officials got the impression that Bonn would not press for missile talks with the Soviets . until there is significant progress on limiting conventional arms . <P> But the next day , Genscher persuaded Kohl to renege on the agreement , mainly as a desperate ploy to win domestic political points . In London an angry Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher declared that " anything to undermine NATO will be damaging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though , have support from other NATO members , and diplomats suggested the likelihood of a compromise before the alliance 's summit meeting in May . But NATO can not discount the dominating figure of Mikhail Gorbachev . In the minds of many Europeans  --  if not in fact  --  Gorbachev has removed the Soviet threat with seductive arms initiatives , particularly his promise to make major unilateral cuts in Soviet army forces in Eastern Europe . <P> That withdrawal began last week , when 31 Soviet tanks were loaded onto flatbed cars in Hungary . Among those watching the pullout was Ilona Staller , a member of the Italian Parliament and a porno-movie star . Staller kept her clothes on when she posed with Soviet officers , and released a white dove of peace . Ominously , perhaps , the bird was crushed in the treads of a Soviet tank .
