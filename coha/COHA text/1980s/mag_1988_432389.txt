 | Why is it these days that so many men seem to be hunting and fishing ? for compliments on their rugged attire ? Even if they never get closer to nature than the potted plants at Abercrombie &; Fitch , they long to look like blood-sport buffs . They may lack the time and inclination for trout fishing or riding to hounds , but who cares when it 's so exciting simply to dress the part ? The risk to the wallet is dangerous enough ; ounce for ounce , these upscale sporting clothes must rank among the most expensive quarry in the world . One requires , of course , the britches , hacking jacket , heavy sweater , vest , loden coat , tweed cap , wool socks and gum boots . Pigskin accessories are extra . At the best places , London 's Purdy James &; Sons or Holland &; Holland , the rural get-up runs about $1,000 . But undaunted by peak prices , pseudosportsmen pile into Range Rovers ( page 57 ) in search of predatory fashion . The best dressed are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Sundays to a common rallying cry : a man is only as good as the sport he wears . Outdoor gear has never been so fashionable . Legions of L.L. Bean loyalists are still wearing their preppy Duck Blind wardrobes , and every summer brings out the Banana Republicans in their Safari styles . Now they 're being joined by a host of outdoor dandies . Instead of waterproofed outerwear from Land 's End , today 's elegant outdoorsman wants to wear only slickers from London or the finest Italian wools . Devotees are easy to spot ? they 're the ones decked out in every kind of expensive allweather wear no matter what the weather . Their stylish rustic jackets are always new ? or newly old ? with lots of pockets and straps to store gear they 'll never own and could n't name . Ralph Lauren , pioneer that he is , started frontier fashion advertising in the early ' 80s , featuring genteel couples riding on the open range or canoeing in the Adirondacks . Other menswear manufacturers have since caught on ; they 're bagging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magazines are thick with woodsy fashion spreads . These model jocks may be hunting , fly-fishing or scaling a rocky ledge , but it 's all in the name of Good , Clean Fashion . All the leading designers are in on the game : British Khaki offers a paraffincoated canvas hunting jacket for $150 ; Tommy Hilfiger reinterprets a red-andblack lumberjack jacket for $220 , and even Giorgio Armani makes suede shoes with rubber lug soles for $300 . " Men like an air of authenticity , " reasons Alan Flusser , a menswear designer . " They identify with clothes that look useful , that are part of a tradition that transcends fashion . " What 's going on , of course , is nostalgia for a time when men were men and all the tasty little varmints knew it . So what if nowadays a man 's prizes are mounted in his closet and not in his den ? It 's the pag- eantry and passion of sport that really makes the masculine pulse race . " Women like to look at lovely , thin models for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Associated Merchandising Corp . " It 's the image , the romance , the fantasy . " Predatory fashion ads are designed to hit home . One of the most striking is a Georges Marciano ad for Guess ? , a stark black-and white photograph of a father and son by a pond , a rifle in the young lad 's hand . The image is old-fashioned , but the subliminal message is thoroughly modern : buy our jeans and you and your kid will have quality outdoor time together on weekends . " These ads show men in complete control of their environment , " says Joseph Margolin , a Washington psychologist who specializes in consumer motivation . " Men are buying a role . " No one markets masculinity better than the folks at Ruff Hewn . Their fall ad features a portrait of a hunter on a snowy day : a lean woodsman toting a double-barrel shotgun under one arm , wearing a fleece-collared jacket , leather game bag , cartridge belt , knee-buttoned jodhpurs and lace-up boots . The gun and ammo are n't for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be lived , " says Ruff Hewn president Jefferson Rives . " But if you ca n't live the good life , then you can at least dress like you do . " The firm 's fictional turn-of-the-century namesake , Barclay Ruffin Hewn , is a straight-shooting hero cut in the Hemingway mold . " We like to think Ruff lives in the hearts and minds of all Americans , " says Rives . Well , maybe not all , but a growing number : the six-yearold High Point , N.C. , company claims that sales have been rising at a rate of 250 per- cent a year and totaled about $40 million at last report . If Ruff Hewn caters to the hoof-and-antler crowd , Nautica is after aspiring anglers . Happen upon a Nautica ad in one of the better men 's magazines , and it would be easy to mistake it for a major **27;1077;TOOLONG firm , such as Penn , Browning or Orvis . Not at all . " We 're not actually geared strictly for fishing or sailing , " says Nautica president David Chu . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four-yearold sportswear firm 's sales up to $22 million this year . " Boaters love our clothes , " says Chu , " We get a lot of calls from the San Diego and New York yacht clubs . " Still , the most fashionable country gentlemen want to demonstrate True Brit . As Ralph Lauren learned years ago , the British remain the best at this sort of thing . Purveyors of sporting goods pronounce themselves dismayed by the predatory fashion trend . Holland &; Holland , the world 's leading custom gun makers since 1835 , can barely keep a stiff upper lip about the city gents who walk around in the firm 's signature oilcloth slickers and green Wellingtons . " You see young men in London wearing a barber jacket that 10 years ago you would only have seen on a tractor driver , " laments an H &H; spokesman . America 's own right-stuff spokesman , Chuck Yeager , a lifelong hunter and fisherman , would n't be caught dead in designer sportswear . Before Yeager sets out into the wild , he shops Sears . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
