Perhaps because Ronald Reagan does n't read all that much , he cares more about what television shows than what print says . He and television both know that facts are heavy , arguments confusing , charts boring ; to grab the biggest audience , give your story the human touch . This is " for-example " journalism and politics , which frequently mislead . <P> Reagan 's homely anecdotes often prove to be factually wrong . TV commonly focuses its cameras on the glibbest or noisiest " man ( or woman ) in the street " to typify instant public reaction . This mutual use offer-example is what made Reagan 's outburst so heartfelt : " Is it news that some fellow out in South Succotash some place has just been laid off , that he should be interviewed nationwide ? " In turn , checking the accuracy of every anecdote the President uses to make a point may seem a picayune exercise for the press , but it is unavoidable when argument by anecdote replaces real discussion . <P> Twice of late the State Department has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ State Al Haig waved a photo spread from the French Figaro of the " most atrocious genocidal actions " in Nicaragua , which proved to be an old picture of something else . State then proudly produced a live Nicaraguan guerrilla captured in El Salvador who proved to be a slick young Marxist recanting all he had been expected to say . Still , the difficulty the Administration has in making , or selling , its case was evidenced in an ambitious prime-time CBS News report on Central America . CBS sent Mike Wallace to Nicaragua , Ed Rabel to Guatemala , and Bill Moyers to El Salvador . <P> It was a well-produced look at three melancholy places . But as in most documentaries , vivid pictures had to be conscientiously " balanced " by words that were inevitably less vivid . In El Salvador viewers saw familiar shootups and corpses in government territory ; with the guerrillas , as Moyers said , " you see what you are shown . " At the end of 90 minutes , Moyers owlishly summed up in documentary neutralese where " we Americans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across a tightrope carrying the past on one shoulder and fear of our enemies on the other . " Viewers , after being subjected to so many pathetic widows , arrogant generals , bombed buses and armed children , might have drawn a much simpler , less judicious conclusion : Why get more deeply involved in such a morass ? <P> At one point , Dan Rather asked Jeane Kirkpatrick , Reagan 's starchy Ambassador to the U.N. , to judge press coverage of Central America ( " Give me both barrels , do n't hold back " ) . Kirkpatrick : " I think CBS has been particularly bad , if I may say so . " The New York Times and Washington Post also got low marks from Kirkpatrick . All three , she said , " suffer from the Viet Nam syndrome . " That phrase is also used by Reagan , apparently to describe a press that does n't believe its Government and " challenges what we 're doing . " The President told TV Guide : " Had that been done in World War II , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men , I think there would have been a revolution in America . "
