By March civic leaders expect to open an enclosed , four-block mall of 150 restaurants and specialty shops aimed at adding enough downtown entertainment sparkle on evenings and weekends to revitalize on the city ' s deteriorating West Side. // To do it , they are teaming up with the Rouse Company , the Maryland-based commercial development and management firm that has scored such downtown showplace successes as Harborplace in Baltimore and Faneuil Hall Marketplace in Boston. // Milwaukee , which has an ethnically mixed metropolitan population of 1. 4 million with the city accounting for almost half the total , was not hit as early or as hard as many cities its size by the usual exodus to the suburbs . But city officials and business leaders say the handwriting of what was ahead for downtown became clear by the early 1970s . They decided they had to start planning then  --  well before vacant buildings were boarded up  --  if the outflow were to be stopped. // " Every year downtown was looking less attractive , older , and a little less convineint  --  it didn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recalls Stephen Dragos , executive vice-president of the milwaukee Redevelopment Corporation ( MRC ) , a private for-profit firm of business leaders formed in 1973 to decide on a specific plan of action. // Four years later MRC decided to launch a mall anchored at each end by the existing headquarters of Gimbels and the Boston Store , largest stores in the state . MRC expected to be only the catalyst in the venture but ended up as a major partner . When the Rouse Company was approached to take on the development job , company officials said they were too deeply involved in other projects to take on more than leasing and management job for Milwaukee. // So MRC , the city , and Rouse formed a three-way partnership to tackle the proposed $60 million Grand Avenue Mall . MRC , which now claims about 50 stockholders , watches over the design and construction and is in effect the developer . Rouse is handpicking the shops to line the 50-foot wide retail skywalks and which will be part of the restored 1916 Plankinton Arcade Building. // The City of Milwaukee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost , took on the all-important job of acquiring the property , demolishing the buildings that needed to go , and making the necessary street , sidewalk , and lighting repairs . Mayor Henry Maier , a veteran of 23 consecutive years in that office , agreed to take part only if no new taxpayer dollars were involved . Accordingly , the city ' s money comes from an Urban Development Action Grant and from tas increment financing , a technique involving borrowing against the future tax value of the property . Apparently convinced that they are in no way paying the freight , milwaukee taxpayers largely support the project . Even Milwaukee ' s Common Council , the local legislative body that has had to pass on a number of mall matters , has given most a unanimously favorable vote. // Hopes are high that the new mall will do much more than create temporary construction and permanent retailing jobs and keep West Wisconsin Avenue lively . The hope is that other businesses  --  and particularly housing developers  --  will be encouraged to join forces and settle in on Milwaukee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most downtown construction activity , including the city ' s one 42-story skyscraper , has been on the city ' s East Side between the Milwaukee River and Lake Michigan . One new West Side ingredient is expected to help : a new federal building employing at least 1 , 000 workers will go up across from the proposed mall. // " We don ' t expect to rebuild the whole downtown but to give it a powerful sense of direction so that everyone feels that their individual businesses and property will prosper , " Mr. Dragos says. // But no one here expects the hoped for to happen without a strong promotional push for the new mall and unless the project succeeds in at least stabilizing Milwaukee ' s West side. // " This is our last shot at briging Milwaukee back , " insists John Schmitt , president of the Wisconsin State AFL-CIO and a man who serves on a number of civic improvement task forces. // Often abundant close-in city housing , which Milwaukee lacks , is considered a critical factor in the success of urban malls. // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the central city , but I don ' t think it ' s going to bring hordes of people back downtown  --  and I ' m a very optimistic person , " says Arthur B. Py Jr. , an architect and president of Py-Vavra Development Inc . In his view the kinds of shops picked by the Rouse Company could make a large difference . The need , he says , is quality merchandise . Necessities , he says , are readily available , but anything else often has to be ordered from larger cities . As a result , " Too much of Milwaukee drives to Chicago to buy their Gucci shoes. " // It was Mr. Py who gave the West Side of town its strongest vote of confidence in recent by designing and building the new Hyatt Regency Hotel near the city ' s convention center and sports arena there . It was the first new hotel in that section in more than 20 years . But as he tells it , he did not have an easy time getting the needed funds from local investors . Eventually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company to get the project off the ground. // " Milwaukee is a very conservative community , " he explains . " Everybody supported the project in theory but because the city wasn ' t in desperate straits , no one was really feeling the pinch . Everyone was reluctant to put up the dollars. // " I call Milwaukee a ' see , feel , and touch ' community , " he says . " Chicago can lease an office building off a set of plans but here you don ' t lease anything until someone touches the walls and sees the view. " // Still , some argue that milwaukee ' s widely acknowledged conservatism may have helped the city financially more over the years than it has hurt . The city has not been overbuilt , for instance , and there have been few business failures. // Also , Milwaukee was one of the earliest cities to set aside banks of cleared land for industrial development within its widely spread 96 square mile perimeters . The city ' s sale of such property at less than market rates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , says James Scherer , one of the city ' s economic development officers . By next spring another $3 million worth of such city land will be ready for sale. // " Over the years Milwaukee has done things very carefully , and I think that kind of conservatism has been positive , " notes Eric Schenker , dean of the School of Business Administration at the University of Wisconsin at Milwaukee . " Its downtown is being developed at a reasonable pace . The city is a perfect laboratory  --  the right size so that whatever you do has an impact. " // But the city ' s wide array of well-managed family-owned businesses , often in a good cash position , have also been ripe targets for acquisitions and mergers in recent years . Latest to go is the Joseph Schlitz Brewing Company , which is being bought out by a LaCrosse , Wis. , brewery . The concern of civic leaders is not just the immediate loss in company jobs but also business lost to local service firms in such fields as accounting and law . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the strongest and most loyal contributors to city cultural and development projects. // The AFL-CIO ' s John Schmitt says he thinks there should be a federal law as there is in Germany , restricting the right of companies to pull out of communities overnight. // " In a lot of these moves the name of the game is greed for profit , and communities are being torn apart by it , " he says. // Milwaukee ' s conservatism has alo helped build its reputation for moving slowly . Paul Juhnke of the Metropolitan Milwaukee Association of Commerce defends it : " We ' ve never been accused of moving too fast . We like to think it ' s because we do what we do well . " Others such as the city ' s James Scherer say that progress only appears slow in Milwaukee because every step is so closely watched : " I don ' t think things take any longer here  --  they just get more attention . Maybe we ' re starved for news. " // Almost the only news a visitor reads of in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on various economic developments , is growing citizen concern ( particularly among the 17 percent of city percent of city residents who are black ) about possible police brutality . Triggering the concern was the arrest one night this summer of Ernest Lacy , a 22-year-old black , for a rape it was later learned he did not commit . He died under questionable circumstances that evening while in police custody . Milwaukee citizens have held several marches in support of a thorough investigation . Though the police department has dismissed the charges in its own investigations , a formal court inquest into Lacy ' s death and circustances surrounding it began Sept. 14. // Although Milwaukee is probably best know to many for its beer production  --  three of the five largest breweries have long been headquartered here  --  only 2 precent of its work force is actually engaged in that industry . The great bulk works in manufacturing . Indeed , Milkauwee ranks first in the percentage of its labor force in manufacturing among the 30 largest metropolitan areas of the country . Although hit hard by the current @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Milwaukee ' s industrial diversity has helped it considerably in weathering that storm . Everything from outboard motors of flour-mill equipment is made here . That diversity has to be patiently explained by city officials every time the city ' s triple A bond rating comes under review and its unusually heavy reliance on manufacturing questioned. // Still , business and city leaders here agree that company departures and rising unemployment in recent years have taken their toll. // " The home construction market is zilch , 65 percent of our mechanical workers are on the bench  --  we ' re not in good shape , " Wisconsin AFL-CIO president Schmit says. // Virtually everyone in Milwaukee agrees that the city needs considerably more economic growth to make up for those losses and to keep the tax dollars rolling in. // But architect Arthur Py , stressing there is nowwhere else in the United States he would rather live than Milwaukee , ar guest that the city will not move forward significantly until it comes to grips with its own identity and begins to aggresively and persistently market its own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shadows of Chicago and Minneapolis that it has a tendency to underestimate its own ability , " he says . " Our people have got to dig in and be willing to show they believe in this city . . . . You can ' t take a neutral position . This community is geared a great deal to the residential taxpayer ' s satisfaction . It does not provide any incentives for ( business ) development . It restrains and controls it . If we don ' t wake up soon , we could lose what we have . Mergers are picking off some of our most successful companies , taking away a lot of our productive dollars . . . . I ' m positive about Milwaukee ' s future but I ' m also very concerned. " // " We know we ' ve got some pluses and some minuses , " says Paul Juhnke of the Association of Commerce , who concedes that most local growth has bee due to expansion of existing businesses rather than to new recruits . " Probably our key asset is our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conpetitive. " // If Milwaukee does not experience the growth in needs , City officials and taxpayers thenselves could face some tough financial decisions in the months ahead. // The city is currenty under court order to curb pollution going into Lake Michigan and must rebuild its swewer system . Civic leaders are muling over the merits of a comprehansive deep tunnel approach to handle both sewage and storm water vs. a separate system for a Either way the taxpayer bill // Also up for a decision soon : whether or not to complete the city ' s crisscrossing freeway system , which links the center of town with virtually any suburb in a 15-to-20-minute drive . Construction came to a screeching hall a few years back when the city ' s priority need was seen as rebuilding housing the developing commercial property .
