He also said that the Administration , the Republicans in the Senate and , to a greater extent , the Democratic leadership of the House of Representatives had not " come clean " with the figures they have been using to calculate the deficit reductions in the two conflicting budget proposals before Congress. // If the Securities and Exchange Commission had jurisdiction over the executive and legislative branches in such matters , Mr. Stockman said , " many of us would be in jail . " <> <> Another Big Deficit Seen // The dispute over the budget for the fiscal year 1986 has arisen because of the President ' s refusal to raise taxes , the House ' s refusal to eliminate cost-of-living adjustments for Social Security beneficiaries and the Senate ' s opposition to further reductions in military spending. // " When the books close on this fiscal year next Oct. 1 , " Mr. Stockman said , " we will have run up another $200 billion in national debt. " // In three speeches this month , far more appearances than usual , Mr. Stockman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deficits continue to undermine the nation ' s economy and that the Government seems powerless to deal with them. // But his off-the-record dinner address on June 5 to the directors of the New York Stock Exchange , their wives and at least a half-dozen Senators and Congressmen was far more forceful than the others . <> <> Guests Confirm Remarks // A copy of the speech , marked " not for release , " was furnished to The New York Times . Several people who were guests at the dinner have confirmed the remarks by Mr. Stockman , director of the Office of Management and Budget. // The White House apparently knew little of his appearance there or his endorsement of tax increases if the impasse in Congress can not be resolved . Thomas C. Dawson , executive assistant to Donald T. Regan , the President ' s chief of staff , said Mr. Regan had not heard of Mr. Stockman ' s remarks and was therefore unsure how the White House would react . " No one ever mentioned it to us , " Mr. Dawson said. // Only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nation ' s budget problems. // After the first occasion , when his remarks appeared in the December 1981 issue of The Atlantic , he offered to resign , but the President took him to the " woodshed " instead . The other occasion was in an interview in Fortune magazine . In the first case Mr. Stockman has said he did not expect his comments to appear until after he left office , and in the other he has said he understood the remarks were not to be attributed to him. // On this occasion the chairman of the stock exchange and Mr. Stockman apparently expected the off-the-record restriction to prevent any disclosure . " That ' s the reason he was so frank , " said the chairman of the exchange , John J. Phelan Jr. , who declined to discuss the remarks . <> <> ' This Monomental Debate ' // At the dinner , Mr. Stockman said : " Let me suggest two standards which apply equally to both sides in this monumental debate. // " First , there is a plausible case for both going-in positions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but neither can be responsibly held unless one is willing to spell out and be politically accountable for the consequences on the other side of the budget ledger : No spending cuts mean drastic tax increases , and vice versa. // " Secondly , as the fiscal crisis has worsened and the political conflict intensified , we have increasingly resorted to squaring the circle with accounting gimmicks , half-truths and downright dishonesty in our budget numbers , debate and advocacy. " // Mr. Stockman ' s comments on tax increases come at a moment when the deficit problem seems to be taking an acute turn for the worse . In addition to the difficulties in Congress over the two budget proposals , the Congressional Budget Office reported Wednesday that the President ' s tax revision plan , intended to be " revenue neutral " in maintaining Federal revenue at its present level , was more likely to result in a loss of revenue . <> <> Settling Upon a Proposal // Mr. Stockman said that until the White House and the Republican leadership of the Senate settled upon a budget proposal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ billion , " our side had not come clean on holding the line on taxes . " The Administration ' s original plan for sharp increases in military spending would have contributed to sharp deficit increases ; the agreement with the Senate calls for holding the military increases to 3 percent a year beyond inflation. // For the same reason , he said , the Administration ' s earlier promise , abandoned in the Senate proposal , to maintain full cost-of-living adjustments for Social Security recipients would have made it " impossible to accumulate the savings needed to close the budget gap. " // Mr. Stockman added , " On the second standard , honesty in accounting , we have not come entirely clean . " He said the Senate budget " rests on some pretty optimistic assumptions about the path of our economy over the next three years - namely 4 percent average growth over the next 14 quarters , inflation where it is and a steady descent of interest rates to 5. 5 percent " on Treasury bills by 1988. // If the Administration and the Senate used the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Blue Chip Indicators , a newsletter , the growth figure would be 2. 9 percent , Mr. Stockman said , and inflation and interest rates would be higher . " It would mean nearly $200 billion budget deficits each year " even with spending reductions in the Senate budget proposal , he said . <> <> Harsher on House ' s Plan // " So if the nation ' s 50 leading business forecasters are correct , " Mr. Stockman said , " for our side there will be yet another altar call : even more spending cuts or an acknowledgement that a last-resort tax increase is in order. " // Mr. Stockman was harsher on the House ' s budget proposal . Like the Senate ' s , it shows $56 billion in deficit reduction in the fiscal year 1986 , but it shows smaller reductions than the Senate ' s in subsequent years and , in Mr. Stockman ' s view , contains still more questionable calculations than the Senate ' s . And in maintaining nearly all domestic programs that the Administration would eliminate or reduce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $10 billion from a domestic budget of $600 billion. // Given the sharp differences between the two sides , Mr. Stockman said , " My point is this : Reasonable people can say that $10 billion is all we wish to take out of domestic spending and $20-$25 billion is what we plan to take out of defense. // " But responsible people must also acknowledge that $20-$25 billion in higher taxes are then necessary to hit the minimum deficit reduction that is consistent with fiscal sanity. " // At another point , he said , " As a policy matter , it is obvious enough that to close this threatening $200 billion budget gap , we must either massively cut spending or raise taxes by large , unprecedented magnitudes - or , by the lights of some , enact a sweeping mixture of both. " //
