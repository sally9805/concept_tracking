 | I am closing my gallery tomorrow , " muttered tered a prominent 57th Street art dealer as he stormed out of the opening of the 1983 Biennial Exhibition at New York 's Whitney Museum of American Art . It 's a scene that gets replayed every two years . Just when you thought it was safe to go back to a museum , the biennial comes along to clobber your received notions of what 's new in the art world . Along with the Whitney biennial , which is raucous and eclectic , the Hirshhorn Museum in Washington has mounted its own small-scale biennial , " Directions 1983 . " The fact that Washington , despite what its citizens say , is not a hub of artistic activity may account for the preponderance of old-new talent at the Hirshhorn : curator Phyllis Rosenzweig evidently felt a need to educate her public . On view are a number of artists whose work is by now a fixture of surveys such as this , among them Julian Schnabel , David Salle , Elizabeth Murray and Jonathan Borofsky . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bankable names , Robert Longo and Cindy Sherman , and three relatively unfamiliar West Coast artists ( Mary Jones , Pierre Picot and Robert Wilhite ) . Satisfying : Still , the quality of the work rather than its newness is what counts , and Rosenzweig 's choices make for a show that is more well rounded and finally more satisfying than the Whitney 's , which includes some of the same people . Borofsky 's art , for instance , can sometimes be tiresome , as indeed it is in the " Flying Figure " exhibited at the Whitney : a dummy , suspended from the ceiling , zooms Superman-fashion toward a canvas resting on the floor . At the Hirshhorn , however , Borofsky 's oddly traditional paintings of a vase of flowers and a single ruby add a dimension to his always restless , sometimes provocative talent . Similarly , Schnabel 's austere , sienna-toned painting of what appears to be chains and amphorae , called " The Return From the Hospital , " is one of the best pictures of his I have seen . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he attempts ( and achieves ) the ultimate gross-out : " self-expression " of the kind found in Greenwich Village art fairs blown up to numbing proportions . Under the heading of " Melodrama " ( the Hirshhorn show 's other sections are titled " Expressionisms , " " From the Model " and " Real Space/Illusion " ) , we are offered Cindy Sherman 's currently fashionable color photographs of herself looking moody in a rumpled bathrobe . They suggest stills of Gail Patrick in some anonymous gangster epic of the ' 30s ? except that " they had faces then . " Just as enigmatic but even more arresting are two minimalist melodramas by Ida Appelbroog called " Mercy Hospital . " In one panel a woman stares blankly out a window ; in the other a man caresses a woman lying on a bed . Both are line drawings done in a painstaking , childish fashion ; they 're both silly and unforgettable . The crowd pleaser in this group is Alexis Smith , whose series of small collages , utilizing ' 40s ads and newspaper headlines , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems to illustrate some Raymond Chandleresque narrative that we get only in bits and pieces . Quandaries : Two of the best moments in the Washington show are provided by women artists ? Elizabeth Murray , an established painter , and Kendall Buster , a virtual unknown . Murray 's work used to look funky ; it has now taken on an almost classic stylishness . " Small Town " is made up of separate panels of canvas that seem to be flying apart on the wall , yet the svelte shapes and jazzy but authoritative colors belie this sensation of imbalance . Buster 's red-andblack constructivist room is a smartly doneup high-tech prison cell in which you can lose yourself in quandaries about the nature of real and illusionary space . Private pleasures like these are comparatively rare at the Whitney show , both because it 's so much bigger and more crowded and because of its more sensationalist approach . Here many works have been chosen as much for their newsmaking potential as for quality . Take " Janus III , " for instance , a throwaway by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elevator interior lined with wood-grained Formica panels : you press the up button and it makes an up noise ; the down button replies in kind . Not much , really , but the Whitney long ago discovered that gallerygoers love piling into a small enclosed space and then piling out again . This sort of media-baiting succeeds best with artists whose work is almost the stuff of media anyway . In their case , more is more , and overkill really kills . Take Keith Haring , the 24-yearold graffiti artist who may be the hottest property in the international art world today . His 14- by 10-foot mural contains some of his now well-known iconography : a dog restraining a tiny figure with a noose around its neck and an airborne TV . But on this gigantic scale Haring 's always electric graphism is riveting . Emblazoned : During the decades of abstract expressionism and minimalism , anything resembling a message of any kind in art was regarded with horror . Now politically oriented art is , of all things , fashionable , and the Whitney 's curators have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by going around a wall that Jenny Holzer has covered with colored squares , each @# @# ART as twigs , shells and palm-leaf fans and resembling Victorian gazebo emblazoned with a carefully lettered , incen- furniture . Elsewhere there are diary message . But the work is positioned so dazzling new works by Jasper that you are all but forced to pass by it Johns , Louise Bourgeois and without looking closely ; it makes its blunt Frank Stella . points obliquely . The same is true of Mike There is no point in trying to Glier 's self-portrait in a mushroom cloud sum up the farrago of paint , video , and Lance Kiland 's combat between a black Haring 's mural : Up from subways and a white man called " The Murray 's Small Town ' : Flying colors Upper Hand " : a certain highCollection of Doris and Charles Saatchi fashion aura does n't so much dilute the agitprop as skew it . On the other hand , Leon Golub 's paintings of political prisoners undergoing torture continue a genre he has been investigating for at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the context of so much ambiguity . The question remains , however , whether the 7 o'clock news does n't do it best of all . Lush Serenity : As in the past , the stage at the biennial is shared by brand-new artists and others whose talent has long been consecrated . Despite the rambunctiousness of the former , the latter have seldom looked better . A huge abstract-expressionist landscape by Joan Mitchell presides over the first room on the fourth floor , its lush serenity a rather misleading indicator of what is to come . In front of it stand three giddy and lovely bronze sculptures by Nancy Graves , cast from artifacts such Courtesy Tony Shafrazi Ga ephotography , sculpture and film that constitutes the rest of the Whitney show , though mention should be made of a few artists who stand out . Eric Fischl 's enigmatic sexual vignettes are both crudely and superbly painted . Melissa Miller 's touching scene of polar bears and a bunny admiring the northern lights is one of the few examples of the " dumb art " that was so big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it were cotton candy . And Mark Tansey 's " Short History of Modernist Painting " perhaps epitomizes the whole mad enterprise . The first panel shows a woman washing a window with a garden hose ; the second , a man butting his head against a concrete wall ; the third , a chicken gazing at its reflection in a mirror . Why does a chicken look in the mirror ? Tune in to the 1985 biennial and find out . JOHN ASHBER , Graffiti on Canvas Of all the controversial art movements to hit New York in recent years , none has so inflamed public opinion as the phenomenon known as " graffiti art . " Critical apologists have hailed it as an art for the people by the people . Most city dwellers , however , view the graffiti that scar slum buildings and subway trains as a threat to their property and even their safety . Typical of these urban snipers is Alfred Oliveri , head of the New York City Transit Authority 's vandal squad , who says , " The trains are saturated with garbage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ art . " But Tony Shafrazi , whose Soho gallery is the classy outlet for graffiti art ( the Fun Gallery in the East Village is the funky , bohemian one ) believes that " it is time to wake up to the fact that we are in a new era . The new artists are the heirs to the continuing tradition of rebellion , play and adventure which is art . They are the champions . " To which art critic Jeff Perrone counters : " Dealers and collectors take cabs , so graffiti is new to them ? they think they just discovered it . " Populist explosion or the latest avatar of radical chic , graffiti art is currently being snapped up faster than Lower East Side real estate . European collectors , ever responsive to any American art that seems to sound the death rattle of our culture , ca n't get enough of the stuff . The superstar is Keith Haring , who began drawing on blank poster panels in the subway and still practices that necessarily rapid and perilous technique to keep in fighting trim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pseudonymous Futura 2000 and Fab Five Freddy , and group efforts like United Artists . Some artists are merely grazed by graffiti . Donald Baechler , now showing at the Shafrazi Gallery , does primitive , scrawled faces that owe as much to sophisticated art brut as to graffiti . Haring himself is hardly a street person : he has made a study of semiotics and counts Aztec art , Jean Dubuffet and Pierre Alechinsky among his influences . But many others who hang around the Fun Gallery are ghetto kids , intoxicated with the possibilities of both spray paint and instant success . Typical is Dominique Philbert , a.k.a . ERO , who at 16 has work at the Fun and at Galerie 121 in Antwerp and is about to have a show in Berlin . His is " new-wave graffiti " ? that is , " graffiti mixed with abstract , " and its dynamism and sensuous color are instantly engaging . ERO prefers to work on canvas rather than on subway cars , though he says , somewhat cryptically : " Graffiti is an art and if art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ J. A.
