106 THE 5II7 URDRY EVENING POST September ' 86 ME EICAL MAMA OX Too late is the medicine prepared when disease has gaMed strength by long delay . ? Ovid 143 B.C. ? A.D. 17 ? ) . The Remedies of Love Mammobile Invited Dear Dr. SerVaas : You recently answered a letter from one of our patients regarding the Mammobile . We would be happy to provide parking space and doctors to examine breasts when you bring the Mammobile to Saint Louis . Further , our office can offer follow-up exams and other support , including a board-certified radiologist for consultation . We are dedicated to making the public aware of mammography 's breast- and life-saving benefits . Alan M. Londe , M.D. Comprehensive Diagnostic Center Saint Louis , Missouri Sulfa at the Bottom of It Dear Dr. SerVaas : I was interested in the article by Berton Roueche about Eliot Warren , in whom the sulfonamide antibacterial caused persistent hiccups . Eliot was also being treated for his diabetes with the drug Tolbutamide . Tolbutamide is one of the sulfonylurea drugs , which are closely related @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of drugs are so common that a hypersensitive reaction to one class of drugs should be a contraindication for the use of the other . Had his hiccups recurred , the Tolbutamide should have been suspected . Dave Ilaulesh , R. Ph . Morrison , Colorado Machobile Needed In a SotEvePosi cancer-prevention survey of 4,000 men , an astounding 62 percent of the men over age 50 had nothad a rectal examination within the past year . Even more disconcerting was the 32 percent  --  more than one-third of our sample  --  who had never had a rectal exam . Prostate cancer is the second most commonly occuring cancer and the third largest killer among men , yet it is highly treatable  --  if caught before it spreads . Logically , many prostate cancer patients first present themselves to physicians after their tumors have spread . Often back pain from a spreading of the cancer to the spine will be the k symptom that brings men to their doctors . After an inspiring interview with Dr. John Donohue , chairman of the Department of Urology at Indiana University , your Society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the early discovery of cancer of the prostate , testicles , and colon . " A mobile unit would be a great idea , " he said as we discussed the screening possibilities . " 1 see no reason why the public could not be educated toward accepting a mobile unit coming to their community to help in this respect . " Dr. Donohue explained that there have been some major improvements in the surgical treatment of prostate cancer . Thanks to pioneering work done at Johns Hopkins Hospital , doctors can now completely remove the prostate , yet preserve the nerves that control erection . Therefore , men can maintain sexual potency after this operation . 108 Both early and advanced carcinoma of the prostate may be without symptoms at diagnosis . But more than 80 percent of patients have disease at diagnosis of stage C or D. ( Stage C means palpable tumors extend beyond the prostate , but without distant metastasis spreading . In stage D , distant metastasis is present . ) It is predicted that there will be 76,000 eases of prostate cancer diagnosed this year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is confined to prostate , and Stage A is unpalpable cancer . We asked Dr. Donohue to bring us up-to-date on the percentage of cancers that have already spread to other parts of the body upon discovery : " Unfortunately , it is almost 50 percent , " he says . " The data leading to this conclusion come from a variety of sources , and perhaps it 's more discouraging than it should be . We notice that data from the armed forces , where they do routine rectal examinations as part of the yearly health checkup , are better than that . They find more low-stage prostate cancers , But if you take large urban statistics , so many patients do not present themselves to the doctor or to the hospital until they are suffering The most Frequent spread of cancer of the prostate to the bone occurs in the pelvis and sacrum . The next most common site is the spine . // September ' 86 with advanced disease . If you gather all of those statistics together , about half the patients with prostate cancer have advanced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of us . We should be promoting rectal examinations much more aggressively , and I think the public should be seeking rectal examinations much more willingly , " Donohue says . " I think that the major t hrust of any public-health impetus in prostate cancer must be an awareness of the value of routine rectal examinations , " he continues . " This is a simple , cost-effective test that requires simply a gloved finger and some lubricant . With the exception of stage-A disease tumors too small to be felt , most will be detected if a patient has prostate cancer . " Something else that people should know about rectal exams is that they are neither expensive nor painful  --  it may be slightly uncomfortable , but it is not painful . Another thing they should know is that one can screen for other things besides prostate cancer with a rectal exam . One of the primary purposes would be to check the lower rectal area . If one has a rectal tumor , this can be felt . Even more important , we can detect GI gastrointestinal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the stool specimen , placing it on a piece of paper , and doing what we call a stool-guaiac test , which is a chemical test that will detect even occult bleeding . So , I think it 's a terribly valuable test  --  probably the most practical test a person can have , not only to help with prostate surveillance but also in terms of the gastrointestinal tract . It 's a very good exam , " Dr. Donohue concludes . We urge the 61 percent of our male readers over age 50 who are n't having yearly rectal exams to have this simple test done immediately . Pap Smears Underutilized Of the 11,716 women who answered the question on our cancer-prevention survey , only 50.3 percent of them answered that they have a yearly Pap smear . Dr. Richard Costlow , of the National Cancer Institute , feels that screening with Pap smears is underutilized in the United States . Each year 6,800 women die of cancer of the cervix . He feels we could lower this number by raising the percentage of women getting Pap smears . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't have annual Pap smears to begin having them yearly . Hope for High-Lysine Potatoes Dear Dr. SerVaas : I know of your great interest in the field of human nutrition , and I have enclosed a preprint of a paper that will soon be published in Scientific , imerican . I send it to you now because we have demonstrated the production of the high essential amino acid protein in potato plants and are preparing several papers for publication . We still have a long way to go before we have plant foodstuffs that contain enough of the essential amino acids to make a difference in the diet of the world 's poor . However , I think that we will achieve this in another five years . We have the gene in potato and sweet-potato plants and are working in cassava , rice , and corn . Rest wishes for continued success in your work . Jesse M. Jaynes Department of Biochemistry Louisiana State University Raton Rouge , Louisiana Dear Dr. Jaynes : Because potatoes are such a mainstay in the diet of the poor and can constitute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nutritional value is obviously most important . You are to be congratulated on this fine work . We are very interested in genetically adding lysine and other essential amino acids to potatoes . Please let us know when these high-protein potatoes might be available in the United States as well ! Malignant Hyperthermia Dear Dr. SerVaas : Would you please clarify statements in my letter ( May/June 1986 , page 110 ) regarding malignant hyperthermia . Paragraph five of the letter says that the niece ' son had malignant hyperthermia after a simple appendectomy . MH is caused by patients ' allergy to the anesthetic . Malignant means " sudden onset " ; hyperthermia means " elevated high temperature . " If a patient is known to have this possibility in the family history , proper anesthetics should be used . Every two months the Malignant Hyperthermia Association of the United States publishes a " Communicator , " a brochure of information and letters from people who have lost loved ones to the sudden onset of MH during surgery . In the last " Communicator " ( Vol . IV , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CPK levels have been found ineffective as a screening test for MH . They do n't operate for malignant hyperthermia . Mrs. Herb Trandal Watertown , South Dakota We continue to receive letters on malignant hyperthermia ( MH ) , a rare but serious complication in the use of some general anesthetics . It occurs about once in 15,000 to 2.0,000 cases using anesthetics . MU was originally fatal in 70 to 75 percent of the earlier cases ; with aggressive treatments , death rates may now be reduced to 10 percent . The symptoms are often found only after the initiation of anesthetic . Body temperature may increase to as high as 110 ? F. ; extremely high heart rates and chemical imbalances may also occur . Three categories of drugs have been identified as triggers for the reaction . The first group includes potent , fat-soluble anesthetics , including halothane , cyclopropane , and nitrous oxide , among others . The second group includes many muscle relaxants that have also been implicated in MH , including succinylcholine and tubocurarine chloride . The third group includes all amide-local anesthetics , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ procedures , but none are without false results  --  either positive or negative . The most common diagnostic test is to stimulate biopsied muscle tissue to contract by placing it in a water bath containing caffeine and halothane . In some individuals , examination of muscular tissue will show characteristic changes under an electron microscope . Some studies indicate that other conditions need to be present before the predisposition to MU is actually triggered . Among these are tension and anxiety . This finding may also help explain why some MH patients have episodes of the crisis despite previous uneventful surgeries . Your Society is attempting to compile a study of case histories of people who have had this surgical complication . We encourage our readers to send us information about problems encountered by themselves , relatives , or friends . Men : Beware of Balloon behind Knee Joint When giving male patients a complete physical examination , physicians always feel the popliteal artery  --  the one that runs behind the knee joint  --  for exaggerated pulses or for a rhythmic ballooning of the artery instead of the regular pulse . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medicine . For example , a few years ago it took an art eriogram to locate an aneurysm behind the knee joint . Such an aneurysm can cause loss of the limb if surgery is not done in time . An arteriogram involves injecting dye into the blood vessels to cause aneurysms to show up on X-rays . Now your doctor can use ultrasound and " bounce " sound waves off the artery , not unlike radar . This painless , risk-free procedure is easily done on outpatients . If an aneurysm is indeed present , the surgeon will still need to do an arteriogram to judge the adequacy of the circulation in the leg below the trouble . But with the perfection of ultrasound techniques , the arteriogram is no longer necessary for every patient who has a suspicious pulse . For reasons not yet known , most popliteal aneurysms occur in those over 60 ; males are nine times more likely to develop them . If you feel a swelling or an unusual throbbing on the back of your leg behind the knee , see your physician immediately . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is replacing the pill with " the patch . " Instead of being given pills or shots , an increasing number of patients now receive medication via adhesive patches that simply attach to the skin and last for days . Scopolamine , the first drug to be given transdermally , is used to combat nausea and motion sickness . The patch is particularly useful because it can not be vomited up as a pill or a liquid might be . Later , drug companies began putting nitroglycerin in patches . Many patients prefer this form of medication . Pills tend to be rapidly absorbed , which may cause headaches . The patches act more slowly and last much longer . Another advantage to the patch is the uniform dosage it provides . Pills tend to release large amounts of medication at first  --  then later they provide too little . Patch administration eliminates these peaks and valleys in the dosage . The latest addition to the patch pharmacy is Catapres-TTS  --  a drug used to control high blood pressure . The most remarkable feature of the patch is that it lasts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reduces the amount needed to accomplish its purpose . Though not licensed for uses other than hypertension , clonidine ( the drug in Catapres-TTS ) has been reported to reduce the desire for nicotine . A reader told us a clonidine patch caused her to stop smoking . in surprise , she remarked , " I have lost all desire to smoke ! " We will watch for further reports of Catapres-TTS being used to stop smoking . Mal de Meniere Dear Dr. SerVass : I always read your interesting articles about different ailments , but I am anxious to find something about Mid de Meniere . I am suffering from this terrible ailment and would like to read in The Saturday Evening Post a complete description of this evil sickness . I have gone completely deaf , and the noises inside my head drive me to even think of suicide . I am 77 years old , and as I am deaf , my doctors do not explain to me what the course of this disease is  --  where it leads to  --  and so I am in the dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or Meniere ' s disease is an inflammation of the acoustic nerve . It causes head noises and deafness in the affected ear and impairs balance , for the balance organ and its nerves are also involved . The cause of the malady is yet unknown , but many physicians suspect that virus infection in the nerve could be the cause . " Geographic Tongue " Dear Dr. SerVaas : We have come to love you through reading our subscription to The Saturday Evening Post and the " 700 Club . " Four years ago I came down with the shingles and began using L-lysine , which I still take , and am feeling better than I have in years . My husband also had a slight case of them last summer when he was under much stress . He took some and still does . Thank you so very much ! I am really writing to tell you about a dear friend who has been diagnosed with a " geographical tongue . " She has gone to over 30 doctors and is getting worse , as it now has affected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some swelling . We have also read and been told diet is involved , and she is taking B. I am wondering if there are any suggestions you or Post readers might give us as to the cause of the condition . Jeanette reertnan Fremont , Michigan Vitiligo Ideas ? Dear Dr. SerVaas : I have a skin condition called vitiligo ( white patches ) . I never read anything about it  --  is there new medication for it now ? What about tanning pills ? Are there people in the reading audience who have had it or who have it now ? Is there any help ? Mary S:ilasi Flemington , New jersey A Diabetic Pickle Dear Dr. SerVaas : I 've only recently started reading your magazine , because of the good-health recipes you publish ! My mother is a diabetic and can have no sugar , but she loves pickles . Do you have recipes for making pickles using no sugar ? Or can you refer me to someone who can supply such information ? I can find nothing in the bookstores or the library . Continue to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recipes . I love it . Renee Hallett Brownstown , Indiana The Sulfa Solution Dear Dr. SerVaas : In your May/June ' 86 issue , Dr. Berton Roueche writes about a patient 's struggle with hiccups on and off for over 25 years before he finally zeroed in on the culprit  --  one of the sulfa drugs . After a bout with a spastic colon and depression for many months , I made an appointment with a general practitioner . In the course of his examination , he inquired about the drug I had been taking for chronic cystitis . It was one of the sulfa drugs . He phoned my urologist and asked him to change my prescription to a nonsulfonamide drug . Almost immediately  --  no more " spastic " colon , nip more depression . Jean Keane Englishtown , New Jersey Colitis Club Grows Dear Dr. SerVaas : I have never gone to a doctor about this , as it is n't severe . But having read your article about irritable-bowel syndrome and kidney stones maybe having some connection , I decided to look into this diet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have related to fructose and lactose . When I stay away from these things I have normal bowel movements . I had a kidney stone removed by shock-wave lithotripsy and am more than willing to find out why I formed one in the First place . Mrs. Thomas L. Rollinson Hermitage , Pennsylvania Dear Dr. SerVaas : It is great not to have stomach aches after following the Colitis Club diet . I used to have watery diarrhea but it has improved . I had a physical exam while on this diet and my reports are much improved from the last physical examination . My doctor said for a 68-year-old senior I was doing great and he approved of going on this diet . Thank you for your help ! Alice Hawk eda Los Angeles , California Others wishing to receive the Colitis Club diet may do so by writing to Colitis Club , P.O. Box 567 , Indianapolis , IN 46206 . N Melanoma continued from page 58 excellent job that no skin grafting was necessary . My next step after the surgery was to wait for the biopsy report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a crucial step . The survival rate in melanoma is determined by the size of the tumor and its depth of skin penetration . It was a long weekend . In addition to the emotional pain , I now had considerable physical discomfort . Every time 1 looked at Megan , I cried . The thought of not seeing my daughter grow up was more than 1 could bear . Tim , as always , was amazing . He hardly left my side as I talked and talked and cried . . . My doctor called as soon as she received the biopsy report Monday morning . The news was good , but mixed . On the positive side , the tumor was within the size limits of being " probably cured . " The other side ? that the tumor had penetrated the third layer of skin  --  placed it in a higher-risk category . Statistically , 1 had an 85 to 90 percent chance of being all right . My family physician and the surgeon were elated . And a few weeks later an oncologist told me that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explained to her , " I am not used to being in your business . " I wanted more . 1 wanted assurances . I wanted a clean bill of health . Most of all , I wanted to return  --  just for a little while  --  to my former naivete . I wanted to be able to ignore the fact that I  --  that anyone  --  can die at any time . 1 wanted to go back to believing " it ca n't happen to me . " Living Today I am considered a cancer survivor-1 am in a minority . I have suffered no major disfigurement or lingering physical problems as a result of the malignancy . Others see me as a lucky person who lived through cancer . I finally see myself that way too . It has taken a long time . In spite of my good fortune , however , I can not say that it is " over . " Emotionally , I will always be recovering to some extent . I will never be considered really cured , because no one can say with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wo n't have another incidence of melanoma or some other form of cancer . The impact on me is that I have a weighty awareness of my own mortality . I can no longer be complacent about life .
