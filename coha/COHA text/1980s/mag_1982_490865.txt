THE TAM OF THE TOWN Notes and Comment AFRIEND has sent us a report about some recent develop  --  ments on his block , in Chelsea : A few months ago , someone who was passing through our neighborhood decided to pass through one of our apartment windows . This was at four-thirty in the morning . My wife and son and I live on the second floor . The window was n't locked . I had opened it a few inches to let in some air . He must have thought I meant him , too . My mistake . Just guessing , I think he wanted to look around and see whether there was any stuff that we probably did n't feel like keeping anymore but that he would enjoy owning for a while . He made enough noise to wake me up . I made some noises back . He left the same way he came in , and we never got to discuss fine points . After that , I bought a power drill and made holes in the window sashes and then sank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that now the windows can be latched and open at the same time . This helps a lot , because the weather has turned warm and we are ready for fresh air again . Besides , if anyone tried to come in the window now he would set off a burglar alarm that would wake up me , my wife , our child , the rest of the building , and probably Leonard , too . Lately , Leonard has been our neighbor across the street . Some people might take one look at Leonard and write him off as a statistic  --  a homeless and presumably miserable vagrant . It is Leonard 's opinion , however , that he has many homes . The other day , he told me that he is thinking of moving to Sutton Place , where he has lived before . He likes Sutton Place . Moving will involve the chore of taking along his belongings . He wears a lot of clothing  --  a T-shirt , a work shirt , denim overalls , a sweater , a cotton zipper-front sweatshirt , and a parka @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a still more extensive wardrobe . He stores it in boxes atop two dollies that he owns . The boxes also contain cur  --  tains , record albums ( Sonny and Cher , the Carpenters , Barbra Streisand ) , books ( titles like " Army Field Man  --  ual : Rifle Company , Platoons , and Squads " ) , clock radios , stereo speakers , women 's purses , shoe-shining equip  --  ment , and , I assume , plenty that is hidden . On top of one dolly , there is a mattress and some box springs . Most of these things are for sale . Leonard also owns a large , somewhat mangled piece of plaster and gauze  --  formerly a cast that ran from someone 's hip to his ankle , from the look of it  --  that has been inscribed " Svenski : It 's always something ! Love , Shirley . " I do n't know whether it is for sale . I certainly do n't want to romanticize Leonard . He grew up on Long Island , but he sounds as if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scraggly white pointy beard and not many teeth . I put his age at somewhere between forty and seventy . He leads a harried life at times . Some of his friends badger him for money , and he gives it to them , tell  --  ing them to go buy themselves some Thunderbird wine and leave him alone . " I drink , but not like these other guys , " Leonard once told me . " I only drink for the calories . " When he needs to wash up , Leonard goes to a McDonald 's or an Irish bar on the avenue . A doughnut shop around the corner often gives him free food . One day last week , Leonard had to do some errands , and he asked one of his friends to guard his belongings while he was gone . But his friend fell asleep on the job , and when Leonard returned he discovered that someone had walked off with one of his clock radios . Leon  --  ard moves up and down the block , but usually he parks his belongings near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweeps the sidewalk and the gutter . The day he lost his clock radio , one of the dollies was left in disarray . " I got to apologize for the way things are around here , ? he said . " I like to keep things neat . " For several days now , there has been a dark-stained maple desk alongside the dollies . If Leonard keeps it much longer , I am going to assume that he does not intend to sell it , and I am going to give him some paper and lend him a typewriter and encourage him to sit at the desk and record his night thoughts . My own night thoughts have been crowding each other for room inside my brain lately . One consequence of sleeping with open windows on a busy block is a certain loss of sleep . Around dawn today , for instance , a big truck came by at high speed , shifting gears , creating a terrific amount of noise , and my wife woke up and said she was afraid the truck was aiming for our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the corner . I no longer consider it unusual to be awak  --  ened by shrill noises from , say , a woman with green-and-purple hair who is telling her boyfriend , a free  --  thinker who does n't mind wearing leather during the summer , to get out of her life  --  that just being near him makes her want to throw up . When this happens , I usually get out of bed and stand at the window and watch and listen as they sit on a stoop and loudly discuss each other 's special traits and defects . Eventually , the po  --  lice arrive and tell them to go home  --  which I hope they end up doing , to  --  gether . Eventually , I get back in bed and lie there and try to sleep . Usually , I ca n't . There are other noises from below . The gay bathhouse a few doors away is busy very early and very late . After the big truck came by , two men who I bet were either on their way to or had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this con  --  versation : " Are you upset ? " " No , I 'm not upset . " " I thought you were . " " Why should I be upset ? " " I do n't know , I just thought you were . " " Why ? Are you upset ? " A few minutes later , someone else walked by , saying , " Belgium totally outplayed Argentina , baby . Outplayed ' em . " I also heard " So I hired a pair of pants " and " Do n't leave that there . That 's city garbage . It 's against the law . Leave ours there . Ours is n't city garbage . Ours is Mafia . " I do n't want to give the impression that any of this offends me , or that I no longer think this is the same won  --  derful town I have been telling insen  --  sitive out-of-towners it is all these years . In this season , it is certainly bet  --  ter to live here than in the country , where there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and raccoons who would get into that garbage and make noises that would frighten me and cause me to think I was being burglarized when I really was n't . I know my bearings here . On my block , there are no win  --  dow screens , because there are very few flying insects . And there are no raccoons . I am assuming that there are no false alarms . Excellent THE 4-H Clubs of Nassau County held their annual rocket meet re  --  cently in a parking lot called Mitchell Field , which is part of a long plain adjacent to the Hempstead Turnpike . We interviewed three participants , age nine , near the launclipad . Fms-1 Km ( three feet six inches , holding slender six-foot rocket ) : It 's my first year . I 'm not officially in the competition . My rocket 's too big . It JULY 5 , 1982 took me three weeks to build it . It 's called a Mean Machine . You do n't know how hard it was to spray-paint it . SECOND KID : Mine only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) FIRST KID : So ? SECOND KID : So last year I made a Viking . It went up and the cone did n't come off , so the parachute did n't re  --  lease  --  I had painted the cone on by mistake  --  and it came down and went right into the cement and the whole thing blew up . It was pretty cool . THIRD KID : This one goes up two thousand feet . Supposedly . SECOND KID ( pointing at third ) : Me and him are from last year . Our club meets every Saturday . THIRD KID ( explaining the process of rocket building ) : It all comes in a kit , right ? So first you have to , like , get the engine mount hooked in place . Then you paint the body . The body is a cardboard tube , like the inside of paper towels . Once , I tried making a rocket with the inside of some Bounty paper towels and put a paper cup on it for a cone , but it did n't work . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some cardboard and twisted it around until it made a point , and it worked . Anyway , then you punch out the fins . They 're made of balsa wood and come in a form in the kit . SECOND Kin : Not mine . Mine has plastic fins . THIRD KID : Then you have to paint the fins and put on the decals , and you also paint the cone any col  --  or you want . Mine is black . I guess most people do black . I do n't know why . FIRST KID : Mine 's sil  --  ver . It looks better . SECOND KID : Mine is a whole bunch different from theirs . This is , like , a whole bunch of cargo space here at the end . You can stick caterpillars in there if you want cargo . I put ants in . FIRST KID : When did you do that ? SECOND KID : About a week ago . THIRD KID : What 's the best thing that can happen ? The best thing that can happen is it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kid ) That probably wo n't happen with yours . FIRST KID : Yeah , defi  --  nitely it will . SECOND KID : Last year , a kid had a Mean Ma  --  chine , and it went up about len feet and turned around and came straight down into the mud . THIRD Kw : Boss . The first kid is sum  --  moned to the launch-pad . Secant Ktn : The kid with the Mean Ma  --  chine 's name is Mi  --  chael . I want his rock  --  et to go off . But he 's acting too tough . He thinks he 's big just be  --  cause his rocket is . I 'll probably get hysteri  --  cal , though , if it does n't go off . MAN AT LAUNCH PAD : Five ... four . . three ... two ... one . The rocket is launched with an ac  --  companying sound like that of a giant beer can being opened , and a small cloud of sulfur  --  ous smoke . It rises straight up . At its apex , several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pears . The crowd applauds . SEcolso Kw ( shouts ) : Michael , man , that was excellent ! Lunch DURING the past year , many New York City churches have been offering the needy free meals , and from time to time we have been drop  --  ping in on Sunday lunches served at All Angels ' Episcopal Church , which is housed in a commodious four-story structure of granite and red brick on Eightieth Street between Broadway and West End Avenue  --  the remnant of a delightful ecclesiastical complex that included an enchantingly lacy Gothic church and extended along West End Avenue as well as Eighty-first until 1979 , when the rest of the complex was torn down . ( It has since been replaced by a yellow brick apart  --  ment house . ) On the main floor , up a half flight of stone steps from street level , are the church office and the chapel , and on the second floor , in a high-ceilinged auditorium that oc  --  cupies the entire story , All Angels ' serves its Sunday lunches . The par  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plans to transform the auditorium into the actual place of worship , and , one Sunday , held a mea  --  suring meeting right through lunch . Architecturally fluid , the parish is also socially informal . During that meet  --  ing , we learned that Carol is the Reverend Carol Anderson , the rector , and Steve is the Reverend Stephen Pogoloff , her associate . Paul , John , and Judy , three youthful parishioners , are the lunch committee . ( Eventual  --  ly , we learned their last names , which are Seldon , Kohan , and Ferguson , re  --  spectively . ) They round up a vol  --  unteer team from the congregation  --  the team 's membership varies from Sunday to Sunday  --  to plan menus , cook food , serve it , chat with the guests , and clean up afterward . Paul is rangy , like a tennis player ; John , with an assertive black mustache , resemhles a poster for women 's lib when he is doing the dishes ; Judy , a long-haired blonde , often wears slacks and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and mat  --  ter-of-fact , but busy  --  especially on Sunday afternoons . Even so , they found time , on the fly , to tell us that they had originally started the free-lunch program because they were con  --  cerned about people in the neighbor  --  hood whose Social Security or disabil  --  ity or welfare payments did not keep up with the cost of food and who were therefore not getting enough to eat , but that they had lately been serving more of the new poor , " who did not know how to apply for assistance , and that almost all the guests were lonely as well as hungry and , even if they did not want to talk about themselves , wanted to be in , or around , conversa  --  tions . The free lunches are paid for by church funds and donations . Every Sunday morning , a volunteer sets out a portable sign on the corner of Broad  --  way and Eightieth Street announcing free lunch at 2 P.M. From about twen  --  ty guests at the start of the year , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buffet . Two long serv  --  ing tables with folding metal legs are set up parallel to large windows that overlook Eightieth Street , and similar tables , seating eight or ten on folding metal chairs , and smaller tables , seat  --  ing four , are set out around the room for the guests . Some guests arrive ear  --  ly and help the volunteers arrange the tables and chairs and carry up the big electric coffee and tea urns from the main floor , where they have been in use during a coffee hour that follows the Sunday-morning service . The kitchen is in the rear of the base ment . It is a generous rectangle domi  --  nated by an immense , ancient black stove aptly named Vulcan ; the kitchen also contains a small refrigerator , a double sink , and several venerable wooden tables . A nearby storage room holds restaurant-sized soup pots for cooking and giant green pottery tu  --  reens for serving soup . The committee helps the volunteers carry the tureens up the back stairs and across the big room to the buffet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women , black , white , and yellow , and all ages except the very young and the very old  --  approaches the buffet in an informal line , and the volunteers start serving . The guests find paper plates , cups , and napkins and plastic spoons , knives , and forks on the buffet . In the cold months , the menus invari  --  ably include soup , fresh bread and but  --  ter , fruit juices , and milk . The desserts are fruit in some form  --  apple sauce is a favorite . Although the company is hungry , no one pushes or shows impa  --  tience or , having been served and seat  --  ed , falls to without decorum ; only the speed with which the buffet line moves  --  the volunteers run up and down the stairs to replenish the sup  --  plies , and serve with reflexes that would score high in a video game  --  betrays urgency . There is sometimes a lull after the first serving , but guests continue to arrive for the next hour or so . Second helpings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guests can take them home . One cold Sunday , Paul cooked up a vat of take-home spaghetti , because he thought the visitors could use another nourish  --  ing meal in such had weather ; each guest , in addition to lunch , got a pack  --  age to take home . When the volun  --  teers are not busy serving , they chat with the guests , working to overcome their shyness  --  shyness about being hungry , about being needy , about be  --  ing among strangers . As with every  --  body else , the visitors ' shyness takes different forms . Every week , one stout , gray-haired black woman brings some  --  thing to read  --  one time , we noticed , it was a tract on pain  --  and buries her  --  self in her literature . However , she peeps over her pages , and the moment somebody sits at her table she is ready to talk . There is a battered Steinway grand in excellent musical condition near the windows . One Sunday , a volunteer named Angela , a toothpick-slender young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around her head , improvised , with a finished technique , from bits of Schubert , Schumann , and Chopin , weaving them into a romantic background for the room 's subdued conversations . As she concluded , a guest , a dark-eyed woman with long brown hair , who had been listening in silence , went over and asked the pia  --  nist to accompany her . The white woman sang black spirituals in a love  --  ly , trained soprano . On the very cold Sunday , a young woman so perturbed that she had to be persuaded to eat asked the volunteers if they could find her and her husband a place to stay . She was exceptionally pretty , with wide gray eyes , elegant features , and what one of the more knowing woman volunteers recognized as a first-rate haircut . Her husband had lost his job , the young woman said ; they had been evicted from their apartment , and the best she could extract from whatever welfare people she had seen was the advice to come back in thirty days . One of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cause he knows a lot about emergency shelters . He talked to the guest , and must have said something helpful , for after a while she went to the piano and worked through the beginners ' pieces from Bach 's " KlavierbUchlein . " At another lunch , one table held a discus  --  sion about jazz , and a young , bespecta  --  cled black man sat down at the piano and illustrated a traditional stride bass . He had nothing for the treble , so his audience hummed a tune . Last April , Judy and Paul and John began debating , during dishwashing in the kitchen , what to serve when the weather grew too warm for soup . We eavesdropped on their conversation while volunteers brought down serv  --  ing utensils . A young woman bringing in a tureen said as she put it in the sink , " Marjorie liked the chick-peas in the soup . " Judy described Marjorie to me : she is an intense middle-aged woman who comes to lunch in a worn tailored suit and scrutinizes the room like a schoolteacher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likes to give marks on the meals . The committee appreciat  --  ed the compliment ; they want their cuisine to be enjoyed . They returned to the subject of summer fare . Besides cost and nutritive value , there is the problem of chewability ; people with fi  --  nancial lacks are likely to have dental woes . When May came , Judy tried out , after the soup , a salad recipe that com  --  bined pasta , tuna , and chopped greens , which was received with great ap  --  plause . That lunch also featured three-bean salad left over from a church pot  --  luck supper . It , too , made a hit , and one of the guests , a tall young man who never takes off a gray cowboy hat , teasingly announced that he was glad the New Yorkers at the church had learned about " American food . " The next time we stopped in , several weeks later , lunch was a casserole of diced ham , green peppers , and celery served over rice and accompanied by three-bean salad . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and this lunch qualified as a feast . As the months passed , we noted some subtractions , among them a mid  --  dle-aged man who had mentioned one Sunday that he had a job interview the next morning . More frequently , guests return for lunch or to bring good news ; a young man who had been ex  --  tremely depressed one Sunday bounced back the following week to announce that he had found a job at an antique importer 's , and to tell the singer and a volunteer named Marion about the amazing rarities and horrendous prices he had observed at work . As of June , many newcomers needed encourage  --  ment . We recall a very gray woman  --  hair , face , skirt  --  who came in and asked " May I have something to eat ? " and , when Marion nodded and direct  --  ed her to the buffet , asked again " Is there something for me ? " For the rest , though , conversation has generally loosened up . The room remains visu  --  ally drab , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buzz of talk . We overheard guests dis  --  cussing capital punishment ; compar  --  ing psychiatrists and psychiatric social workers ; matching techniques of fish  --  ing and eeling . We listened to talk of Dostoevski , Joan Sutherland , the Prin  --  cess of Wales , and the thrilling first-act curtain in " Angel Street , " when Leo Carroll nearly forgot his hat . Al  --  most everybody wants a say , but the company seems happiest when all can agree ; for example , an articulate black man in his thirties sounded as if he were summing up a consensus at his table when he said , " The social classes talk to each other more nowadays than they used to . " On the last Sunday we stopped in , it happened , by coincidence and vaca  --  tion schedules , that no male volunteers had appeared , so after lunch the male guests insisted that the women of the parish allow them to fold up all the tables and chairs and carry them to their storage places . The morning had been rainy , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and bright . On the steps of the church , we could get a green glimpse of Riverside Drive to the west and the lively crowds on Broadway to the east . When we first came by , it would be dark and cold by four-thirty , and everybody would hurry away , but since then something more than lunch , and something be  --  yond the turn from winter to sum  --  mer , has taken place : cohesiveness and esteem have grown . In the mild , opalescent air , guests and hosts lin  --  gered on the stone steps , reluctant to separate . What began as charity now looks very much like friendship . ifsphalt Jungle ANA MAE , a four-ton elephant who is at present an employee of the Big Apple Circus , had to get to Staten Island for some performances , so one morning last week she did the unnatural thing : she took the ferry . Members of the press were invited along as observers . This was the same morning that President Reagan came to town . As media events go , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shortly before nine o'clock , Anna Mae and her handlers showed up at Slip No. 3 at the Manhattan end of the Staten Island Ferry . Paul Binder , the founder , director , and ringmaster of the Big Apple Circus  --  thirty performers , one ring , one ele  --  phant , one leopard , three horses , eight dogs  --  was there . So was Bennie Wil  --  liams , who is Anna Mae 's trainer . Leonard Piekarsky , Assistant Commis  --  sioner of the Bureau of Ferry and Gen  --  eral Aviation Operations , and Tisha Tinsman were on hand , too . Assistant Commissioner Piekarsky 's job was to collect Anna Mae 's fare . Tisha Tins-man 's job was to wear a lot of makeup and not very much else and to stand on Anna Mae 's left kneecap until Bennie Williams said " Foot ! " This command made sense to Anna Mae . She raised her left foot , and Tisha Tinsman ended up astride her , just behind the ears . During performances , Tisha Tinsman also does some tricks on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phant . Bennie Williams made some im  --  promptu remarks about how the natu  --  ral habitats of elephants are disappear  --  ing . Paul Binder announced , " Because of Anna Mae 's size , we are paying forty times the normal fare . " By curl  --  ing her trunk in an ingenious way , Anna Mae was able to grasp a check for ten dollars and present it to Assis  --  tant Commissioner Piekarsky . The particular ferry trip that Anna Mae took is normally scheduled as a dead  --  head run  --  an empty post-rush-hour shuttle from Manhattan to Staten Is  --  land . Assistant Commissioner Pie  --  karsky said that he was glad to have Anna Mae aboard , and that he would be glad to accommodate the empty express buses owned by the Metropoli  --  tan Transportation Authority on that run , too . " For some reason , they 'd rath  --  er waste gas running back to Staten Is  --  land through the tunnel , " he said . " I 'd ship the buses for two-fifty apiece . " At one point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Young , who is the shop steward of Local 333 of the deckhands ' union , the United Marine Division , standing in the crowd . Pointing at Anna Mae , he asked , " Is she a member of your union , Joe ? " " No , " said Joe Young . " And she 's supposed to go through the turnstile . " " If we get enough elephants , we wo n't have to raise the fare , " said Assistant Commissioner Piekarsky . Anna Mae boarded the ferry ahead of a semitrailer truck that was going to transport her from the ferry slip in Staten Island to the next circus site , in Snug Harbor . The Big Apple Cir  --  cus is a not-for-profit enterprise that tours within a limited radius . It had just finished twenty performances in ten days at Cunningham Park , in Queens , and was headed for nineteen performances in ten days at Snug Har  --  bor . The truck trailer turned out to be too high to clear the entrance to the ferry , so Anna Mae had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make it aboard . Then she got out and posed for photographs and did whatever else Bennie Williams asked her to do : she knelt and raised her left front foot ; she stood on her hind legs ; she waved a white handkerchief ; when Bennie Williams dropped his cane , she knelt and picked it up . A pro  --  fessional investor and money manager named Alan Slifka , who is the chairman of the board of the Big Apple Circus , said , " Anna Mae is either the first- or second-smartest ele  --  phant in the country  --  I 'm not sure which . " The trip through the harbor to Staten Island took twenty-three min  --  utes . It was a bright , windy , sunshiny morn  --  ing . A fireboat saluted Anna Mae . The crew of the ferry consisted of two engineers , two oilers , two pilots , six dockhands , and one mate . The mate was Edward Hillis . " I 'm in charge of the cargo , " he said . He has been work  --  ing on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fleet 's senior mate . He was im  --  pressed by Anna Mae but not unduly impressed . " My third month on the job , I had the privilege of taking a ride with the teen-age Dionne quintu  --  plets , " he said . In the line of duty , he has also met John F. Kennedy , Robert Kennedy , Nelson Rockefeller , Doro  --  thy Kilgallen , Sterling Hayden , Ed Sullivan 's wife , and some Russian bears who rode the ferry many years ago on their way to a wrestling ex  --  hibition at Madison Square Garden . In Edward Hillis 's opinion , Anna Mae behaved much better than the bears . When the ferry ducked in Staten Is  --  land , Jimmy Tinsman , Tisha 's hus  --  band , disembarked and walked around on stilts , saying , " Wadja back , folks . " A woman television reporter sat atop Anna Mae , in the spot usually re  --  served for Tisha Tinsman , and said , " Well , believe it or not , Anna Mae and moi made it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the ferry and said , " Everyone stay away from behind her . She ca n't see back there . " A troop of Brownies and a troop of Girl Scouts were waiting in Staten Island . Anna Mae is a Burmese woodland elephant , approximately thirty-eight years old . Not only does she weigh eight thou  --  sand pounds , she is also nine feet tall . When she passed by the Brownies and the Girl Scouts , they made a noise , in unison , that sounded exactly like " Eek ! "
