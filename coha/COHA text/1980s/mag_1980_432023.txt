 | Final congressional approval of President Carter 's " windfall profits " tax on March 27 sets in motion a massive transfer of wealth from the oil industry to the federal government . The bill ? described as the largest single tax ever levied against one industry ? is designed to soak up part of the extra revenue that oil companies will make as government price ceilings are lifted . Congress intends to use the proceeds to cut personal and corporate income taxes , help the poor pay rising fuel bills , improve mass-transportation systems and support development of new energy sources . How will the bitterly debated and much amended measure affect American motorists , homeowners and businesses ? Following is a breakdown . Mountains of Money By conservative estimates , the windfall-profits tax ? coupled with Carter 's decision to gradually lift price controls on U.S. oil production by Oct. 1 , 1981 ? will raise about 586 billion dollars in new federal revenue over the next 10 years . In addition to 227.7 billion in windfall taxes , Washington is expected to collect 358 billion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and higher royalties on production from federal lands . State and local governments also will share in the decontrol bonanza by collecting about 118.5 billion dollars more in corporate and severance taxes on oil production . Oklahoma alone could net more than 600 million dollars a year in additional taxes by 1982 . Even after paying off federal , state and local governments , oil companies will keep some 223 billion dollars as decontrolled domestic-oil prices soar to the free-market price , now about $35 a barrel in the U.S. and sure to move higher . In all , decontrol is expected to yield the oil industry an additional 1 trillion dollars in pretax revenues by 1990 . Meaning for Motorists Gasoline and diesel-fuel costs , because of decontrol of prices on crude oil , are expected to rise about a penny a gallon per month over the next 18 months . This 18-cent increase , plus 10 more cents resulting from Carter 's new import fee on oil and future price hikes by foreign oil producers , could push the cost of gasoline to $2 a gallon by the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some experts say that fuel prices will reach the $2 level much sooner . Dan Lundberg , a gasoline-marketing analyst , predicts that gasoline prices will be averaging $2 a gallon by the end of 1980 . The latest average nationwide price for all grades of gasoline was pegged at $1.24 a gallon . Already the high cost of driving is having a major impact on motorists . Gasoline consumption is down 8 percent so far this year , and some experts believe the drop-off is permanent . Americans in 1990 will own more cars than in 1978 , says Theodore R. Eck , chief economist for Standard Oil Company ( Indiana ) . But he adds that reduced driving forced by higher fuel costs and the improved fuel mileage of new automobiles mean " gasoline demand for automobiles is expected to drop from the peak of 5.4 million barrels per day in 1978 to only 4 million barrels a day in 1990 . " Homeowners ' Bounty More solar-energy collectors and windmills will be sprouting from the roofs of American houses if homeowners take maximum advantage of generous tax credits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be eligible for up to 600 million dollars in new tax credits for buying and installing equipment that produces energy from the sun or wind . The credit also is available for equipment that taps underground geothermal wells . The legislation expands such tax credits to 40 percent , or $4,000 , of the  | first $10,000 spent on equipment beginning on Jan. 1 , 1980 , and ending on Jan. 1 , 1986 . The old maximum credit is $2,200 of the first $10,000 . For example , a homeowner who installs $10,000 worth of solar-heating equipment in his principal residence in 1980 and expects to owe $6,000 in federal income taxes for that year , can use the new credit to cut taxes to $2,000 . This provision is expected to cost about 533 million dollars in lost tax revenue over the next six years . Boost for Business The windfall-tax bill broadens , lengthens and adds tax incentives designed to encourage business and industry to develop and use new forms of energy . Although no single industry will reap a bonanza , tax credits available are expected to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A major beneficiary is the fledgling solar-energy industry . Jerry Robinson , president of Solar Science Industries , Inc. , of Beltsville , Md. , says that tax credits contained in the windfall legislation " represent a shot in the arm " for solar-equipment makers . " A tax credit of $4,000 will make it much easier to sell solar to homeowners , " he notes . Added Richard Montgomery , a marketing specialist with Dow Corning Corporation : " The new tax credit is enormously important for the industry because it makes solar competitive with electricity and oil for residentialspace heating . " Before , he noted , solar could compete only for the hot-waterheating market . Montgomery estimated that the industry installed 50,000 to 60,000 solarenergy systems in 1979 . President Carter wants the industry to install up to 20 million more residential solar-heating units by the year 2000 . Some experts predict that sales of solar equipment will increase from 280 million dollars a year currently to between 375 million and 500 million in 1981 , depending on what happens to the construction industry and interest rates . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tax credit from 10 to 15 percent for companies that install solar , wind or geothermal-energy equipment . Lawmakers also included special tax breaks for particular industries and certain parts of the country . For example , an 11 percent tax credit for utilities that buy and install equipment to produce electricity from small , existing dams will primarily help New England , where more than a third of all such dams are located . More plants to produce fuel from shale and coal may soon spring up in Colorado , Wyoming and other Western states as a result of the money provided by the windfall tax . Congress hopes the new tax credits designed to promote the use of alternative fuels , once combined with about 18 billion dollars in direct subsidies contained in the yet-to-be-passed synthetic-fuels legislation , will get this long-awaited fuel industry off the ground . Congress also voted a special 10 percent tax credit for intercity bus lines that expand carrying capacity . A spokesman for Trailways , Inc. , says the tax will be " helpful . " But , she adds : " Unfortunately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bus companies ? the replacement of existing equipment . " Companies that produce alcohol for motor fuel are already the beneficiaries of generous government subsidies , and they will get even more help from the windfall legislation . The bill extends the exemption from the 4-centsa-gallon federal excise tax on gasohol ? a blend of 90 percent gasoline and 10 percent ethyl alcohol ? or other alcohol motor fuels through 1992 . Alcohol producers also are eligible for an income-tax credit of up to 40 cents a gallon . And the present 10 percent energy-investment credit for equipment that produces gasohol is extended through 1985 . These credits are expected to heat up an already booming industry . The government reports that it issued 51 applications for commercial alcohol distilleries in 1979 , compared with none the previous year . So far in 1980 , 44 permits have been issued . Permits for small , on-farm distilleries have increased from 18 in 1978 to 1,517 in 1979 and 1,300 so far in 1980 . Aid to the Poor Congress earmarked 25 percent , or 56.8 billion dollars , of windfall-tax revenues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next decade . This includes 3.1 billion dollars that has been set aside to help poor people pay utility and heating-oil bills in 1981 . The aid will be funneled through Social Security or given to states in block grants for redistribution at the local level by welfare agencies in either cash or tax credits to eligible households , operators of subsidized-housing projects and energy suppliers . An estimated 20 million families will be eligible for aid in 1981 . Typical payments will range from $100 to $500 for a winter . Eligibility will be limited to low-income households as defined for each part of the country by the Bureau of Labor Statistics . In 1979 , the national average income for a low-income family of four persons was $11,600 . States may also give aid , regardless of income , to households that receive food stamps or aid to families with dependent children and to needy Social Security recipients and pensioned veterans . Under the formula worked out by  | Congress , a larger share of the aid will go to big industrial states in the Northeast and Midwest than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example , Pennsylvania will receive 196.5 million dollars , while Texas will get 83 million and Florida 58.8 million . Oil Producers ' Share Despite 227.7 billion dollars in new taxes , the impact on oil companies will be partially offset by increased revenues stemming from decontrol of domestic-oil prices . Industry spokesmen say that increased after-tax revenues of 223 billion dollars over the next 10 years will allow the industry to step up the search for new oil supplies and wring more production from old fields . Since President Carter announced his decision to decontrol oil prices starting last June , most major oil companies have made sizable increases in their exploration budgets . Result : A drilling boom is under way and still gaining momentum . At latest count , 3.669 drilling rigs were working in the United States ? a 23-year high . Independent producers , who do about 90 percent of the drilling in the U.S. , received special treatment in the windfall bill in hopes that they would step up exploration . These producers ? mostly small companies or individuals who do not own refineries or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or 23 billion dollars , of the total tax . Major producers will pay the rest . Industry analysts predict that the new tax , added to price decontrol , will encourage oil companies to undertake riskier exploration ventures . The tax , for example , does not apply to oil discovered above the Arctic Circle or in much of the interior of Alaska , except along the Alaskan pipeline corridor . The bill also makes it more profitable to find new oil than to pump oil from old fields . And lower tax rates will apply to oil that requires special recovery methods . The American Petroleum Institute estimates that by the mid-1980s , oil companies will find 2.3 million barrels a day more in oil production than would have been possible had price controls remained in force . Without the windfall tax , the trade association claims , oil companies would have found 4 million barrels a day . The U.S. currently uses some 18 million barrels of oil per day , about half of it imported . What Happens Next Most experts agree that the major impact of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months if not years to be felt . Originally conceived as a means of encouraging energy conservation , improving mass transit and developing alternative fuels , the tax was turned by Congress into a huge general-revenue measure . Lawmakers earmarked just 15 percent , or 34 billion dollars , for synthetic fuels and mass-transit programs and allocated 60 percent or 136 billion dollars for future cuts in corporate and personal income taxes . The rest , 25 percent or 57 billion dollars , is aimed at helping the poor pay for fuel . These allocations are only for guidance , since all the new revenue will flow into the Treasury 's general fund . More legislation will be required before the money can actually be spent , and sentiment is growing in Congress to use some of the money to reduce the federal deficit and balance the budget . " How to spend the windfall-tax revenues could become an annual battle on Capitol Hill , " observes a Wall Street analyst who monitors the oil industry . One consensus of the experts : In the end , the windfall tax will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for gasoline , heating oil and other petroleum products . Tax Changes That May Affect You Congress approved several important , non-energy tax measures as part of the " windfall profits " legislation Interest and dividends ? Individual savers and investors may exclude $200 in interest and dividends from federal income taxes in 1981 and 1982 . Couples filing jointly may exclude up to $400 . This means that in 1981 a single person with $500 in interest and dividend income need only pay taxes on $300 of that amount . The current exemption , on dividends only , is $100 per taxpayer or $200 per couple filing jointly when each spouse has dividends . The new exclusion applies to any combination of interest and dividends paid by corporations , banks , governments , savings and loan institutions , mutual funds and money-market funds . Congress approved the new provision , which will cost the Treasury some 4.3 billion dollars in 1981 and 1982 , to stimulate saving and investment . Opponents claim that 90 percent of the benefits will go to persons who already receive more than $200 or $400 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large increase in new saving and investment . Inheritance taxes ? The legislation repeals a 1976 law aimed at taxing heirs on the appreciation of assets prior to the benefactor 's death . Under the new law , the cost basis of inherited property for tax purposes will be its fair market value at the time of the decedent 's death . The change will mean 3.4 billion dollars less in federal tax revenue between now and 1990 . Inventory profits ? After Dec. 31 , 1981 , corporations that liquidate their assets will pay taxes on inventory profits if they used the " last in , first out " inventory method . The method , which is becoming increasingly popular , inflates the worth of inventories by valuing all stock at replacement cost , instead of original cost . The provision 's intent is to tax inventory profits as income at liquidation . The new tax is expected to raise 2.3 billion dollars in revenue over the next 10 years .                    @
