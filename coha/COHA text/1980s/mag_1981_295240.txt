For some of the old salts gathered last week in Groton , Conn. , to witness the commissioning of the U.S.S. Ohio , the U.S. 's first Trident nuclear-powered submarine , the occasion was tinged with sadness . Standing before them was the frail but still forceful Admiral Hyman G. Rickover , the man most responsible for the Navy 's nuclear fleet . Only days before , Secretary of the Navy John Lehman , 39 , had recommended that Rickover , 81 , now Deputy Commander of the Navy 's Sea Systems Command , retire after 59 years of active duty . <P> It was not the first time the Pentagon brass had tried to ease Rickover into retirement . But he has been able to beat back every attempt by marshaling the support of powerful friends in Washington . When he turned 64 , the Navy exempted him from mandatory retirement , and since then Presidents have given him a series of two-year extensions on active duty . <P> Rickover is legendary for his tart , occasionally profane testimony on Capitol Hill , and critics argue that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's chief nuclear officer . He has had rancorous relations with General Dynamics ' Electric Boat Division , the builder of the Tridents , charging the manufacturer with needless delays and outrageous cost overruns ( now $420 million over the original estimate of $780 million in 1974 ) . Says one Pentagon source : " He 's gone through several Secretaries of the Navy and several Secretaries of Defense and has ignored most of them . " <P> Though some of Rickover 's aging defenders have left Congress in recent years , he doubtless hoped for a sympathetic ruling from President Reagan , at 70 no spring chicken himself . Asked about Rickover , Reagan reminded reporters that William Gladstone was Britain 's Prime Minister at 83 . But at week 's end White House sources said Reagan had decided that Rickover should retire . Apparently to soften the blow to the proud sailor , Reagan plans to ask him to serve as a White House adviser on nuclear energy .
