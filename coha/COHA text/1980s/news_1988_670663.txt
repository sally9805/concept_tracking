" I was extremely impressed with the professionalism of the response this Monday in our people in the gulf , " Adm . William J. Crowe Jr. , the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , said at the end of a CBS News interview last Sunday morning . " It was extremely good . And our weapons , which are often criticized for their sophistication , worked well - extremely well . We were very satisfied with that . " And we ' re often maligned on our command setup , " continued the admiral , who as the nation ' s ranking military officer participated , from a Pentagon command post , in minute-by-minute supervision of the operations on April 18 . " It was short , flexible and responsive , and I think that it proved that we do have the right command setup in that part of the world. " // With a broad smile , he said to the interviewer , Lesley Stahl : " That ' s my commercial , Lesley . " <> <> Cause for Thought // A few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minings in the gulf , or from terrorist actions , by the sharp American response ? Would an even tougher action have been more effective ? Are leaders in Washington hampering commanders on the scene as they supervise operations using instantaneous communications ? These leave many Navy men pensive beyond their pride. // Iran ' s placing of mines in the gulf , including one that badly damaged the frigate Samuel B. Roberts on April 14 , is an example of an event that can be viewed either optimistically or pessimistically . Officially the Navy points with great satisfaction to the performance of the Roberts ' s crew in fighting flooding and fire on the ship , which might well have sunk had the crew not excelled in damage control . But that begs the questions , which the admirals can not answer , of why Iran decided to lay fresh mines at this point , what its next operation against the United States might be and what can be done to stop it. // A retired admiral , Wesley McDonald , who commanded the Grenada operations in 1983 , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the United States Naval Institute in Newport , R.I. , last Friday that the American warships ' successes of April 18 were just half the picture. // " Why the extraordinary number of ships in the gulf , with such modest success ? " he asked . " Every day there ' s a tanker on fire . You have to say it ' s a modest success . It certainly does not deter the Iranians , or the Iraqis , from attacking shipping . " <> <> ' Sink the Iranian Navy ' // Admiral McDonald ' s audience was 500 Navy loyalists , meeting at the Naval War College , in a city that is home port to several ships operating in the gulf , including the Roberts . He won the strongest applause of the day when he approvingly quoted former Navy Secretary James H. Webb Jr. as saying , in a commentary in The Washington Post , that sailors in the gulf " continue to serve their national leaders better than their national leaders serve them . " Echoing Mr. Webb again , he told the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Iranian Navy. " // The Chief of Naval Operations , Adm . Carlisle A. H. Trost , in addressing performance rather than political decision-making , offered a more typical uniformed perspective on the gulf episodes. // " When weapons are on target first time , every time , it tells you something , " he told the Newport audience . In an interview afterward , he said his message was this : " Here is proof of professionalism and readiness . These things do not go right by accident. " // That the whole affair was brought on by a mine detonation that split the frigate ' s beam and immobilized its engines did not faze Admiral Trost . He read a line from an early bulletin sent out by the crippled Roberts : " All my principal combat systems are operable. " // " He was ready to fight , " Admiral Trost said , " and that was the message he was conveying to his task force commander . " <> <> The View From the Academy // A visitor to the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came to the success of the retaliatory operations in the gulf . The main concern expressed by the future officers was that the use of military force had been restrained. // In particular , the midshipmen wondered why Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci intervened during the fighting to prevent the Navy from finishing off a crippled frigate , the Sabalan , after an attack jet had dropped a single 500-pound bomb on it. // Mr. Carlucci ' s decision , which officials said had been made in order to bring the fighting to a close , was one of at least two in which the highest civilian authorities gave direct orders to combat forces in the gulf . President Reagan , at another point , had to be asked for personal permission before attack jets could unleash bombs on some Iranian speedboats that were shelling offshore oil rigs near the United Arab Emirates . <> <> The Question of Supervision // Some say there was too much of this kind of supervision , while others disagree. // To a number of critics , including a White House aide who is familiar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Security Council , the gulf episode smacked of interference in affairs that would have been best handled by commanders on the scene. // " There was all sorts of micromanagement , Carteresque management out of Washington , " this aide said of the planning and execution of the gulf operations , referring to the hands-on management style of former President Carter. // It is not a trivial issue . Military analysts frequently cite what they call the interference of President Ford in the Mayaguez incident of 1975 , and that of President Carter in the planning of the 1980 attempt to rescue hostages in Iran , as having led to disastrous consequences in each case. // But Admiral Trost disputes the charge of overmanagement in the gulf fighting . Even with all ears listening in on an electronic network , " the national leadership had the patience and the self-control not to usurp it , " he said , " by going from Washington to the guy on the scene to tell him what to do.
