 | For years the drumbeat has been the same from mainstream economists and politicians of both parties : some day the deficits were going to do us in . The Reagan administration and Congress over the last seven years combined to produce " the most irresponsible fiscal behavior in American history ? bar none , " says Thomas McCraw , professor of business history at the Harvard Business School . With few dissenters , nearly every analyst believes that the perceived inability of U.S. policymakers to get the deficit down and keep it down contributed to the global financial panic . As the world watches , congressmen and members of the administration are sitting down once again to take a chunk out of the deficit . Yet they initially spoke of getting only $23 billion out of next year 's deficit , which the Office of Management and Budget projects at $163 billion . For Wall Street and finance ministers in Europe and Japan , that 's a " preposterous " figure , McCraw says . Why ? It 's precisely the amount of budget reduction the Gramm-Rudman- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Stephen Roach , a senior economist at Morgan Stanley &; Co. visited Washington last week and in frustration shouted at congressional staffers , " If that 's all you 're going to produce , the president may as well go off to the ranch . " The " market collapsed , " Roach says , " knowing that $23 billion was supposed to come out next year . Do they think there is going to be a rally if that 's all they get ? " The answer , plainly , is no . And to the world 's currency , bond and equity traders , how the government gets beyond $23 billion is less important than simply doing it . " I think it 's very important to convince the rest of the world that we are going to deal with our problems in a way that 's responsible , " says Greg Smith , chief investment strategist at Prudential-Bache Securities . What will convey that message ? At the very least , a wide variety of analysts say , the government should produce a multiyear package that slashes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deficit by 1990 . And , says Roger Altman , an investment banker and former Treasury official in the Carter administration , it should avoid " one-shot revenues like asset sales . They are just not credible . " Genuine deficit reduction requires tough political choices , which is why the deficit has remained so high for so long . But for most everyone who is not a congressman , the steps necessary to pare the deficit would simply not inflict unbearable pain . As last year 's $73 billion reduction showed , deficit cutting and economic growth can coexist . Thanks mainly to Gramm-Rudman , spending in fiscal 1986 increased by less than 1 percent , and the republic survivec But Gramm-Rudman is deeply flawed ? as next year 's cuts , if allowed to go through . would demonstrate . Precisely because it exempts 80 percent of the total budget from cuts , next year 's Gramm-Rudman reduction requires many draconian steps : steer cuts , for example , in the staffs of the FBI and the Federal Aviation Administration Policymakers can actually chop the deficit more over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It just requires something a little more thoughtful than the economic equivalent of bloodletting . For one thing , the budget 's so-called entitlement programs ? military and civil-service pensions , Medicare , farm subsidies and social security must be fair game in any serious effort to cut the deficit Together they represent more than 40 percent ( $506 billion ) of the total budget . But only 20 percent of all entitlements ( $101 billion ) are aimed at reducing poverty . The rest goes to middle-class and affluent citizens . Most analysts believe an equitable way to get entitlement programs onto the negotiating table is to exempt poor Americans from cuts in the programs that benefit them ? Aid to Families With Dependent Children and Medicaid . Nobel Prize-winning economist James M. Buchanan offers a proposal widely echoed in recent weeks : reduce the automatic cost-of-living adjustments now contained in the entitlement programs . As Peter G. Peterson , former secretary of commerce has pointed out . limiting COLAS to 60 percent of the annual inflation rate over the next 15 years would save more than $150 billion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , more complicated , matter . A fierce debate now rages over whether , in the wake of a stock-market crash , taxes should be increased . The argument against , in essence , is that it would be akin to stepping on the throat of a choking man . A stock crash portends , in the eyes of some , a possibly steep decline in consumption . If people feel less wealthy they wo n't spend as much , and then busi-  | ness wo n't invest . Ronald Reagan and many of his intellectual supporters on the right ? notably supply-side economists ? believe this deeply and have steadfastly opposed tax increases . They have loudly waved the banner of " Hooverism " to ward off such a tack . They are also deeply suspicious of congressional motives because they believe any new revenue will be spent , not used to reduce the deficit . The supply-siders are joined by traditional Keynesian economists , who also believe tax increases would now be poisonous . Robert Eisner of Northwestern University believes the deficit had nothing to do with the crash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the economy and contributed to investors ' panic . Between the two camps lies reason . The logic of the supply-siders and the Keynesians , taken to its extreme , means the government could just borrow all the money it needs and forget taxation altogether . As Roger Altman argues , " Real taxes have to be part of " any deficit cutting . The best opportunity for policymakers is a gasoline tax . " We could stand a pretty major gasoline-tax increase , say 50 cents a gallon , " says Altman . " Since our oil imports are rising anyway , the conservation benefits would be positive for all of us . " If the politicians do n't like that much sacrifice , consider this : every penny of a gasoline tax would raise $1 billion . A 10-cent increase could cut the deficit by $10 billion . A policy that lets the tax rise , penny for penny , with any decline in oil prices would conserve energy and make it less likely that OPEC could regain its stranglehold over the West any time soon . And money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , argues that a gasoline tax would " create empathy around the world " for the United States at a time when it desperately needs good will from its major trading partners . " In Europe everyone pays $2 and $3 a gallon in taxes for gasoline and resents our cheap gas . The same in Japan . " Some politicians oppose a gas tax because it 's regressive ? that is , it takes more money , proportionately , from the poor than the rich . It also penalizes people who depend solely on their cars for transportation . " It 's been politically untouchable because the consumer does n't like it , " concedes Altman . " But this is a time for sacrifices . " Economists also believe taxes could be increased on tobacco and liquor ? so-called " sin taxes " ? without damaging the economy . Morgan Stanley 's Roach thinks sin taxes " get you $7 billion to $10 billion . " And as James Dale Davidson , head of the National Taxpayers Union and a usual opponent of tax increases says , " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ senator from North Carolina , but it ought to be done . " The U.S. dollar must come down further , but it must come down gently . As the stock market 's dramatic decline showed , Treasury Secretary James A. Baker 's efforts to manage exchange rates can be a risky game . In an effort to reduce the U.S. trade deficit , West Germany , Japan and the United States acted together to bring down the value of the dollar and then managed to stabilize it last February . The trade deficit remained frustratingly high though ; months later the Germans nudged up their interest rates . The last thing the United States wanted was slower growth in Germany , and the markets began to worry that a new plunge in the dollar.was possible . With U.S. interest rates also rising , three weeks ago Baker seemed to raise the prospect of further devaluation against Germany ; that , Wall Street analysts believe , helped trigger the stock markets ' panic . The Federal Reserve Board immediately pumped money into the U.S. banking system , driving interest rates lower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dollar down . The dilemma Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan and James Baker now face is whether to allow the dollar 's further decline or whether to worry again about its long-term inflationary consequences . For now , the answer is clear : let interest rates and the dollar decline to head off a recession . " The Fed can not serve two masters , " says William Niskanen , a former member of Ronald Reagan 's Council of Economic Advisers . " It can pursue exchangerate stability with tight money or it can stabilize the domestic economy with easier money . It can not do both . And it would be a disaster for the U.S. economy and the world if the Fed had n't turned on a dime after the stock crash and started looking after the U.S. economic expansion . The foreign-exchange markets understand this , even if the finance ministers do not . " Even as the dollar plunged last week , stocks rose and interest rates in the United States held steady . That meant the world had changed , and the difference was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have prompted the opposite reaction in equities and stocks . Last week 's response could be a very encouraging sign : it means CGREN the inflation bogey has been forgotten for now ; investors are reacting more to the risk of recession and deflation . If that psychology holds , it gives the United States an opportunity to continue a policy known as " the mauled float . " In effect , the United States and the other industrialized nations can try to bring the dollar down softly without risking an interestrate spike . That has salutary effects : it will in time whittle the trade deficit by increasing exports , and those exports will help keep U.S. factories humming at a time when economic growth may be weakening . To attain some stability in exchange rates in the long run , Baker has proposed altering the current floating-rate system fundamentally . He has talked of pegging the dollar 's value to the price fluctuations of a basket of commodities or some other benchmark . Businessmen in the United States and abroad desire stable exchange rates . For multinational corporations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where the U.S. dollar can lose half its value against the yen in two years . Still , few economists believe a fixedrate policy would be much better . In the United States it would harness domestic economic policies to the dollar 's value ? and that , in the view of Georgia State University economist Donald Ratajczak , " would be unacceptable . " It might , for example , preclude the Fed from flooding the system with money and letting the dollar decline whenever the next crisis arises . Central bankers believe that " the one virtue of a financial crisis is that it forces politicians to do necessary things they would otherwise not dream of doing . " The response of policymakers to the current crisis belies that axiom , at least as far as social security is concerned . The social-security system , since it was " reformed " in 1983 , has again become sacrosanct . But a wide spectrum of economists , liberal and conservative , believe President Reagan and the congressional budget negotiators could take a chunk out of the deficit merely by making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is simple : make all social-securi-@# ty benefits fully taxable to those retirees who are not poor . That , economists estimate , could raise $15 billion to $20 billion in revenue very quickly ? almost as much , in other words , as the Gramm-Rudman cuts slated for next year . Social-security recipients , remember , are on average more affluent than the population as a whole . " This is the only society in the world where the real income of old people has been rising faster than the real income of working people , " says Neil Soss , a former aide to Paul Volcker who is now the chief economist at First Boston Corp . Because that 's so , some policy analysts propose an outright means test for social security . Many policy analysts still resist that idea , including Robert Hormats , a managing director at Goldman , Sachs &; Co . Hormats believes social security has been and should always remain an insurance policy and not , in effect , a welfare program . Their names have become so familiar that you would think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Rep. Willis C. Hawley . In 1930 they drew up the now infamous SmootHawley tariff , and the rest , as they say , is history . Smoot-Hawley was one of the key blunders that turned the 1929 stock-market crash into the Great Depression . Protectionist barriers went up , world trade shriveled and gross national products declined . Congress and the administration now seem to understand that one such bill per century is more than enough . On this point there is near unanimity among economists and policymakers in the United States and abroad : the same protectionist mistake can not be repeated again . Earlier this year Democractic presidential candidate Richard A. Gephardt took extraordinary heat for a House bill he drew up calling for stiff penalties against countries that run consistent trade surpluses against the United States . ( He became known around town as " Senator Smoot . " ) When Congress drew up retaliatory trade legislation last spring against Japanese semiconductor producers accused of dumping their chips into the United States below cost , the stock market promptly plunged a warning that at least some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pledged to veto any protectionist legislation , and the crash on Oct. 19 stiffened that resolve . Now a truly damaging trade bill seems far less likely than the usual pork-barrel legislation . As former Citicorp chairman Walter Wriston says , " The trade bill in Congress today is 1,000 pages of giveaways for special interests . " Yet the trade gap ? which in 1986 hit $170 billion ? remains , seemingly invulnerable to the dollar 's decline . There are , in all probability , reasons for that which elude traditional economic analysis . First and foremost may be consumers ' perceptions . As Harvard 's McCraw says , a fundamental impression has taken hold that foreign goods are better than U.S. products . " American consumers are willing to pay for quality , " he says . " It used to be a question of price much more than it is now . " The second reason is that the dollar has not come down so much against the currencies of other fierce competitors : Korea , Taiwan , Singapore . " For every Japanese TV set that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set has , " McCraw says . " Japan is being hurt without America being helped . " For the United States , that dilemma has no easy solutions . It 's up to American companies to show people at home and abroad that their goods are as desirable as anyone else 's ; and that , McCraw and others agree , may take a while . At some point , if the dollar 's decline continues and consumers slow spending in fear of a slump , import penetration will finally slacken . But that point , McCraw believes , is n't here yet . @# For the last four years more " international economic cooperation " has been the stated desire of West Germany , Japan and the United States . After economic summits , heads of state and finance ministers intone the magic words , as if the wish could make it so . The desire for cooperation led to the accord at New York 's Plaza Hotel in September of 1985 , which accelerated the dollar 's decline from its then extraordinarily high levels . It led , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States and its major trading partners pledged to coordinate their monetary policies so that exchange rates would n't fluctuate wildly . For all that , it is international discord . not harmony , that helped set off the current financial crisis . Today , policymakers recognize cooperation across borders is easier asked for than achieved . But they also recognize that now more than ever it must be achieved . The global collapse of stock markets demonstrated how intertwined global economies are today . So too does the continued volatility in the currency markets . The stark fact is that if policies are not coordinated more closely now , economic disaster becomes a real danger . In an encouraging sign last week , Japan 's Prime Minister-designate Noboru Takeshita told NEWSWEEK that more policy coordination with the United States and other countries is " most important . " He also pledged to take steps to stimulate Japanese consumption , which could aid U.S. exporters . Cooperation , economists believe , must now take place along a broad spectrum . Says former Treasury official Altman : " We need real coordination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Third World debt crisis , just to pick three . " Right now , he says , the Louvre agreement to stabilize exchange rates is " inoperative " ? a verdict supported by the dollar 's decline last week . The markets , Altman believes , are looking for a sign that it will be restored . Most economists want to see the Germans and Japanese cut interest rates in concert with U.S rate cuts . A coordinated rate cut reduces the likelihood that the dollar 's plunge will get out of control and reignite inflationary fears in the United States . It would also stimulate the Japanese and German economies . At the moment that is Treasury Secretary Baker 's primary concern . Jacques Delors , president of the European Economic Commission , said last week that the United States was prepared to let the exchange rate drop to 1.60 marks to the dollar ( compared to a Friday close of 1.73 ) . The remark threatened to accelerate the dollar 's decline and Baker quickly denied the report . But he said his recent agreement with German Finance Minister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the existing target range , which is probably around 1.80-1.90 marks to the dollar . The Germans appear to be yielding a bit to international pressure to pump up their economy . Their short-term interest rates fell after Stoltenberg 's meeting with Baker , and the move was n't all that suprising . The need for close cooperation between Washington , Bonn and Tokyo should be obvious : if the United States lets the dollar fall too far against the yen and the mark , it could have the perverse effect of hurting Ameri- can exports rather than aiding them . That 's because the Japanese and Germans are so dependent on exports that a sharp rise in their currencies from current levels could cripple their economies . That would reduce demand for U.S. exports and do little to balance trade flows . Cooperation from abroad , however , is likely to endure only if the United States cuts its budget deficit . The lack of progress on the budget , says Robert Hormats , is why such cooperative efforts have disintegrated in the past . Now circumstances are different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " says Hormats . That " gives government leaders an extra measure of inducement . " Through the smoke that followed the stock market 's meltdown , public officials and investors all searched for a coherent explanation , if not an outright villain . Many immediately seized on the impact of computer-generated trading . Institutional money managers use computer programs that trigger trades automatically on the New York Stock Exchange and the futures and options exchanges in Chicago . The idea is to hedge in the futures markets when stocks fall as a way of limiting overall losses . The quickly formed conventional wisdom after the crash was that these " launch-on-warning programs " propelled the market downward more rapidly than it would have gone otherwise . In Washington last week William Brodsky , president of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange , conceded that the so-called arbitrage between Chicago and New York did play a role in the record-breaking decline . But he argued persuasively that its role has been exaggerated . Index arbitrage , as a percentage of total-stock-index volume , was actually less on Oct. 19 than usual . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . agreed that after the morning of Black Monday , program trading was not a very big factor in NYSE trading . The Chicago exchange representatives also say , accurately , that part of the problem lay in New York . On the trading floor of the New York Stock Exchange , specialists are always supposed to make markets in stocks . When sell orders come in and ca n't be matched with buy orders ? and there were few buyers on Black Monday ? they are supposed to buy the shares themselves . But the volume that day was so heavy that many poorly capitalized traders almost got overwhelmed . Phelan concedes the exchange did n't work perfectly on a 600 million-share day . But he insists his decision to shut down program trading after the crash was correct . In the short run , analysts say , it probably was . The impact of futures trading on stock-market volatility is not well understood . President Reagan appointed investment banker and former U.S. senator from New Jersey Nicholas F. Brady to lead the White House 's investigation into the issue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traders may be disappointed . Most experts believe program trading adds to volatility in stocks , but it 's not obvious that that alone makes strict limits on stockindex futures worthwhile . The Chicago futures markets do provide a valuable service , permitting big investors to hedge risk most of the time . And there are ways to limit the possibility of another crash without destroying the futures markets . Already the Mercantile Exchange has instituted one-day limits on trading ranges . There will also be calls for increased margin requirements on index options trading ? in effect , limiting the amount of borrowed money used to trade stock-index options and futures . The exchanges and the government agencies that regulate them across the world must clearly coordinate their actions more closely to help dampen , if possible , the kind of panic that overwhelmed them three weeks ago . Markets plunged in sequence across the globe on Black Monday in a furious chain reaction unlike any before it . The capital markets are now a global village , and the same rules ought to apply worldwide . As Harvard 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of program trading take hold here , the dealers will just migrate to London , Tokyo or Hong Kong . " In one example of parallel action , the London exchanges are now looking at their version of the specialist system , just as New York is , wondering if the capital requirements for market makers ought to be enlarged . One clear lesson is that shutting down exchanges does not diminish panic . It merely backs it up , like water rising swiftly behind a dam . Once the fear is unleashed , it 's with a fury . In Hong Kong the market opened after a four-day shutdown and plunged an incredible 33 percent in a single day . By contrast , John Phelan 's strategy at the New York Stock Exchange ? limiting trading by two hours for eight days in order to process backed-up orders ? seemed to work . Volume was massive and few traders were concerned about the early closes . Markets and market regulations do n't cause panics . Fundamental economic concerns do . And those concerns were present right up until the explosion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the American Business Conference ? a group of 100 medium-size growth companies ? gathered for their annual meeting . In one session , OMB director James C. Miller III presented a very rosy view of the economy . One executive present ? Ray Stata , CEO of Analog Devices , Inc. , a linear-circuit maker outside Boston ? chafed as he listened to Miller 's talk . After it was over , Stata challenged Miller 's presentation . He said he thought a market crash was in the offing ? " a huge blowoff ' ' in a couple of years . Their conflicting views were put to a vote . Ninety-three of the executives present agreed with Stata . Seven abstained . The blowoff came sooner rather than later . Now policymakers are left with a heavy burden . Without decisive action , the psychological wound inflicted by the crash may undermine the U.S. economy . Already , ominous shifts in sentiment are evident . Just after the plunge , the vast majority of Americans thought they would be unaffected . A week later , two out of every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is either " very or somewhat likely " in the year . That kind of prophesy can become self-fulfilling ? but it does n't have to . In the United States the early crisis management at the Treasury and the Fed offset the frightful White House reaction and the uncertain efforts on Capitol Hill to deal on the budget . The Fed has moved interest rates lower and international bickering has eased . Those steps could now be frittered away , economists and businessmen warn . The world can only wait and watch ? and hope . As Treasury Secretary Baker puts it , " This thing ai n't over yet , that 's for sure . " NEWSWEEK NOVEMBER 9 , 1987 37
