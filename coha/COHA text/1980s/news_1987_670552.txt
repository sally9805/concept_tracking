The delay dampened the hopes of space agency officials who expected to show that the shuttle program was racing toward a resumption of flights , which were halted after the Challenger disaster 19 months ago . The test was rescheduled for Saturday at 1 P.M. local time. // None of the troubles appeared to be directly related to the booster itself , which sat silently on a desert hillside as engineers swarmed around it , then scurried back to underground bunkers to try repeated firings. // // ' It ' s Disappointing ' // Instead , problems surrounded the testing equipment itself , starting with a cooling system that malfunctioned and spilled hundreds of gallons of water around the aft section of the rocket . That was followed by a software error and two problems that appeared to center on a few of the more than 500 sensors rigged to the test rocket. // " It ' s disappointing , " said U. Edward Garrison , who heads the aerospace division of Morton Thiokol Inc. , the manufacturer of the booster . " We were really hoping to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t like the idea of having to wait another two days. " // Mr. Garrison ' s comments came just moments after the test firing was aborted for the third time today , within 10 seconds of ignition . Throughout the afternoon , while engineers repeatedly raced up a mountainside to the test site in an effort to solve the problems , a crowd of NASA officials , members of Congress and local residents waited around the test site , hoping for a chance to proclaim the space program back on track . <> <> Pressure on Thiokol Shunned // " We ' ve got to be patient and not rush things , " said John Thirkill , the director of operations for Thiokol ' s sprawling plant 25 miles west of Brigham City . " We ' ve had some mechanical problems and some software problems . Glitches like this happen . " Officials of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration took pains not to press Thiokol to proceed with the test , even though there were no apparent problems with the actual rocket . Privately , several recalled the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and insisted that no shortcuts would be taken along the path to a resumption of shuttle flights. // " I made it very clear that there was no schedule pressure or advantage to getting the test off today , " said Adm . Richard H. Truly , who heads NASA ' s Office of Space Flight. // Nonetheless , the troubles were embarrassing to Thiokol , the much-criticized manufacturer of the boosters whose failure triggered the Challenger explosion that killed seven astronauts . In recent days company executives have advertised this test as evidence that they have successfully redesigned the safety seal that failed during the Challenger flight , and made other improvements to the booster . <> <> Description of Mishaps // Today ' s test was scheduled to take place at 1 P.M. An hour before the scheduled launching , the highway in front of Thiokol ' s mountainside test facility was lined with hundreds of nearby residents hoping to see the two-minute eruption of flame and smoke. // The first problem began at 10 A.M. when a six-inch underground water main ruptured . That main , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rocket cases after the test is complete , was fixed in about an hour and a half. // But even after that repair , the first firing was halted 15 seconds before ignition when the connection between a fabric firehose and a metal water pipe broke and leaked wildly. // A second attempt , an hour and a half later , was aborted about three minutes before ignition because the computer system that guides the test would not reset properly , probably as a result of the earlier mishap . While the computer was being adjusted , engineers also discovered that they were getting no readings from a sensor that indicates whether turbines used to steer the rocket nozzle are properly pressurized . <> <> Various Design Changes // The third problem occurred less than 10 seconds before the firing , when again there was no indication that the nozzle controllers were properly pressurized . Officials said they did not know if the problem was once again with the sensor or with the turbine that controlled the nozzle. // The major changes in the booster that was to be tested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ segments of the rockets , which were the cause of the Challenger failure ; the joint that connects the booster ' s nozzle to the case , and the nozzle itself. // Under the pre-accident design , the case segments were connected by a joint that bulged when pressure soared inside the rocket . The Challenger investigation established that a combination of events , some triggered by the subfreezing temperatures the day of the launch , allowed superheated gases to escape through the inside insulation of the rocket and burn through rubber O rings that seal the joint . The cold weather reduced the resiliency of those seals , and the gas burned through the rocket cases and outside struts , and ultimately caused the shuttle to disintegrate. // In the aftermath of the Challenger accident , NASA engineers and the scores of contractors and subcontractors who maintain the craft are working to redesign many components , not just those that destroyed the 25th shuttle flight. // The shuttle ' s braking system , long a source of concern to astronauts when the orbiter lands , is being improved . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is being installed . And the delicate valves used to disconnect the shuttle ' s external liquid fuel tank from the orbiter are being redesigned , for fear that they could accidently shut off in mid-flight and cause the shuttle to crash before reaching orbit. // In addition , thousands of components , particularly those without backup systems , are being reviewed or tested to their limits . By and large , those tests have yielded few surprises , according to NASA officials . But several weeks ago , a long-suspect oxygen flow control valve that pressurized fuel in the external tank burst into flame during a test that deliberately introduced a contaminant into the fuel flow. // " It would have been catastrophic in flight , " said Arnold Aldrich , the NASA engineer who oversees the redesign of the entire shuttle system , said today as he stood in the hot Utah sun waiting for the booster test-firing . " Fortunately , it is something that we began redesigning about a year ago. " // The replacement of the valve , he said , would probably not delay the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
