txt CONSUMERS FACE an increasingly confusing and risky marketplace when they shop for home financing , a new survey shows . Though fixed-rate mortgages are dying a slower death than many experts expected , a growing number of lenders are offering loans with interest rates that can be adjusted up and down . And consumer safeguards , such as limits on the amount by which rates or monthly payments can increase , frequently are omitted . What 's more , a substannai minority of savings and loan associations are offering adjustable-rate mortgages with interest pegged to an index that is stacked in the lenders ' favor , .. in some cases blatantly so . The mortgage survey of S &Ls; was commissioned by American Mortgage Insurance Co. of Raleigh , N.C. It is one of the first such surveys since the Federal Home Loan Bank Board in April authorized federally chartered S &Ls; to join many of their state-chartered counterparts in offering mortgages with fully adjustable rates . A sample of 400 S &Ls; was studied by Research Triangle Institute . American Mortgage Insurance wanted to know how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an insurance plan tailored to changeable-rate loans . The conclusion ? " This survey tells us we 're right on target , " says Claude E. Pope , chief executive of the company . WRITE THE SURVEY found that only 37% of S &Ls; are offering adjustable-rate mortgages , more than half of those who are n't plan to begin by the end of this year . By then , two-thirds of all S &Ls; plan to be making floating-rate loans , and few of those are likely to be offering customers the alternative of a traditional fixed-rate loan . The survey found 41% of S &Ls; are still offering fixed-rate loans , but only 9% are offering both fixed-rate and adjustable-rate mortgages . And 31% of the S &Ls; are out of the market completely , including many that are unable to make home loans of any kind when rates are 18% or higher . The Federal Home Loan Bank Board , which oversees federally chartered S &Ls,; left it up to individual lenders to decide how mortgage rates should be adjusted up and down on floating-rate loans . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ S &Ls; already offering such loans , 28% set a limit on the dollar amount by which they will raise the monthly payment at each adjustment , while 50% limit the interest rate increase . This implies that at least 22% do n't limit either the payment or the interest rate . To be sure , only 5% of S &Ls; with floating-rate mortgages adjust the payment more frequently than once a year , and 28% adjust them every three years , a desirable interval for many consumers . Furthermore , 67% of floating-rate lenders peg the rates to a government index that measures the going rate for mortgages nationally , an index that experts agree is fair and relatively nonvolatile . BUT A WORRISOME SURVEY FINDING for consumers is that 8% of floating-rate lenders peg the borrower 's rate to an index that measures either a national or regional average of what S &Ls; pay to raise money . Most consumers probably are n't aware that this index is stacked against them . Because federal regulators are still phasing out ceilings on rates S &Ls; pay to their depositors , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going up , and will continue to go up , faster than other rates . For example , 20% of S &L; deposits still pay the passbook rate of 51/2% . Federal regulators are talking about raising this to more than 10% . This would increase the average cost of S &L; borrowing by about a full percentage point even if market rates were stable . Even worse for consumers , the survey found a number of state-chartered S &Ls; that peg the mortgage adjustments to their own costs of borrowing . Such an arrangement would be illegal for federally chartered S &Ls,; because it allows them to borrow money at practically any rate they choose and simply pass on the added costs to their borrowers . The poll takers do n't say exactly how many S &Ls; they found using this biased index . The survey says that among the 15% of floating rate lenders using " other " indices , 91% were state-chartered S &Ls,; and " some " of these were using their own cost of funds as the rate peg . The message in the survey for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brisk for mortgage insurance . But the message for mortgage borrowers is : Shop around , and watch out .
