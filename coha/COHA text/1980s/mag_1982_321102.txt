THOMAS MANN : THE MAKING OF AN ARTIST , 1875-1911 by Richard Winston Knopf ; 325 pages ; $17.95 <P> He had the hubris to advance a world view , to rewrite the Bible in his Joseph novels , to devise the great metaphor of Europe as a sanatorium full of the walking wounded in The Magic Mountain . Was Thomas Mann ever unsure of himself , writing his quota of pages day after day in the comfort of a Germany he was later to renounce for exile in California ? Was he ever young ? <P> The answer seems to be yes-just barely-on the basis of the rich evidence assembled by Richard Winston , editor of Letters of Thomas Mann and a distinguished translator , who died at 62 in 1979 after reaching only the 36th year in Mann 's life . <P> The young writer isolated here was hardly a flaming rebel . His favorite form of truancy as a boy was listening to his half-Brazilian mother play the piano and sing Brahms . Papa was a senator of the Baltic seaport town of Lbeck and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a young artist to revolt against . <P> By the time he was 23 , Mann had already struck his friends as " grave . " The brief period he spent as editorial assistant on the satirical magazine Simplicissimus only seemed to increase his specific gravity . The summers he spent in Italy seemed to make him even more German . To go south in a Mann story became a symbol for going to the devil . <P> Once he began writing in earnest , Mann managed his career as though it were the family business . Friends about to review his first novel , Buddenbrooks , a story of materialistic decline and youthful awareness , received detailed instructions from the author , who was 26 . Comparisons to Dickens and the " great Russians " were recommended . About himself , the noted ironist was seldom ironical . <P> He was also seldom wrong ; within two decades he was to be on the shelves with Dostoyevsky and Tolstoy . Even so , he knew at the start that his sense of invention could not equal his powers of observation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be provided with the most realistic of foundations . This was an article of faith with Mann from the outset of his career . " And where was he to find those foundations ? In the lives of his colleagues and contemporaries , no matter how vulnerable they were ; art was everything . Aschenbach , the enfeebled aesthete of Death in Venice ( 1913 ) , for example , was modeled after Gustav Mahler , who was dying at the time . " Nothing is invented in the story , " Mann boasted , as if the confession added to his stature as an artist . <P> It is fitting that this biographical fragment ends with Death in Venice . In that work Mann learned to treat death , madness , self-destruction at the level of genius . Yet when the artist stood up from his desk to talk about his work , he could barely survive his own respectability . For , as The Making of an Artist subtly reveals , Mann may have loved his Latin mother , but he became his Teutonic father . Winston might have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man . At 36 , Mann was complete . - By Melvin Maddocks
