Conflicting goals continue to strain U.S.-Israeli ties <P> <P> Israel 's preoccupation with its domestic maelstrom has momentarily turned attention away from another topic that has been consuming the country 's passions and energy : the ever growing rift between Jerusalem and Washington . U.S. Special Envoy Philip Habib discovered for himself last week just how absorbed Prime Minister Menachem Begin was in his own troubles . When the peripatetic troubleshooter showed up in Israel to discuss a new U.S. plan for the withdrawal of foreign troops from Lebanon , Begin found only 45 minutes for him . Said an Israeli official : " Nothing of substance came up at the meeting . " <P> The silence was deceptive because the report on the Beirut massacre and Ariel Sharon 's subsequent resignation as Defense Minister may have a profound effect , for better or for worse , on U.S.-Israeli relations . At stake is not only Washington 's attempt to break the deadlock over the withdrawal of foreign troops from Lebanon , but also the far broader objective , set out in Reagan 's peace initiative last September @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ West Bank and Gaza Strip to Jordan . <P> The commission 's report was published as relations between the U.S. and Israel sank to one of their lowest points in a quarter-century. * From the President 's anger over the siege of Beirut last summer to Begin 's curt rejection of Reagan 's peace plan to the stalemate over the Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon , everything has seemed to conspire to heighten tensions and deepen distrust . Perhaps the simplest and most basic example : the more President Reagan expressed his disapproval of new settlements in the West Bank , the faster the Israelis built them . Says a senior Administration official : " There is questioning on high as to whether we and the Israelis really do share fundamental goals in the Middle East . " <P> Indeed , only 15 hours before the commission released its findings last week , Reagan had taken the unusual step of criticizing Israel for stalling in the negotiations over a withdrawal from Lebanon . " Israel is delaying unnecessarily , " the President told a group of television newsmen . " For them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an occupying force . " <P> The Pentagon added more fuel to the fire last week when Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger flatly rejected Israel 's terms for sharing military intelligence gleaned by Israel in its Lebanese victory . Weinberger 's decision to speak out just as the Israeli Cabinet was meeting to discuss the massacre-investigation report presumably was no coincidence . It was his way of saying that the Pentagon prefers not to deal with Ariel Sharon .
