Mighty Martin <P> To the Editors : <P> It 's incredible that baseball 's Wild Bill Martin of the Oakland A 's May 11 keeps winning . It is even more astounding that he is everyone 's hero . The only explanation for this pale wrinkled fighter having so many fans is that he has managed almost every team in the league . He captured me when he gave new birth to my Minnesota Twins . <P> ( The Rev. ) Don E. Hutchings <P> Russellville , Ark . <P> It is true that Billy Martin has proved to be one of the best managers in baseball by producing winners in Minnesota , Detroit , Texas , New York and now Oakland . However , the supreme test of his managerial mettle still lies ahead of him : the challenge of making a winner of the Chicago Cubs . <P> James Fredian <P> Arlington Heights , Ill . <P> <P> Arrogant , aggressive and always amusing , the A 's approach adversary after adversary with assurance . Will they annihilate their antagonists ? Will they achieve their aspirations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Robert Rotsch <P> Staunton , III . <P> With so many people participating in active sports , like running , rather than being mere spectators , the only thing incredible about baseball is that anybody is still interested . <P> Jerry Kassanchuk <P> Golden Valley , Minn . <P> You honor Billy Martin , who encourages brawls on the field and participates in them when as a leader he should be stopping them , the man who ambles through life with the finesse of a bull looking for the nearest red cape . <P> Many of us were brought up to believe that fair play , respect for authority and self-discipline are manly virtues . With his behavior , Billy Martin instills the exact opposite in this traditional American sport . <P> Paul J. Kemmy <P> Minnetonka , Minn . <P> You referred to Lance Parrish as the third baseman for the Montreal Expos . Lance is a catcher for the Detroit Tigers . Larry , of course , is the real third baseman for the Expos . <P> Pierre Laxa <P> Orchard Lake , Mich . <P> <P> Lament for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 11 fails to emphasize one basic fact : the conflict is primarily over Lebanon 's sovereignty . It is not a " civil war " between Lebanese Christians and Muslims . The P.L.O . has usurped power in order to have a base for attacking Israel . The Syrians have set up their defenses in our country to prevent a linkup between the Lebanese Christians . The Syrians act as if it were a crime for our people to try to remove the Syrian-Palestinian wedge separating the country . <P> Adonis El-Arz , Director News and Information Canadian Lebanese Association <P> Mississauga , Ont . <P> The war is not between Muslims and Christians . It is between a Christian group , the Phalangists , on one side and other factions that include Christians and Muslims . The non-Lebanese who are fueling the war are the Israelis . Why are the Palestinians in Lebanon ? Is it not because they were expelled from their homeland by Israel 's military aggression ? <P> Ahmad Katnani <P> Madison , Wis . <P> I am Lebanese and Christian . I hurt when I read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I feel an obligation to Lebanon , but attempting to choose a side whose ideals are worth supporting is impossible . Will there be a Lebanon when this is over ? <P> Richard Neju Aswad II <P> Binghamton , N. Y. <P>
