Halley 's comet and the countless others that blaze across the night skies have had a profound effect on history . They have influenced literature , art , religion and warfare , perhaps even evolution and the very beginnings of life . For centuries comets were widely regarded as harbingers of disaster , omens of death , pestilence , wars , drought , earthquakes and floods . Modern science has dispelled many of these myths , but some persist today . In a bizarre twist , scientists themselves are beginning to attribute great cataclysms of the past to what the ancients called " hairy stars . " <P> The Chinese , who recorded the appearances of comets as early as 613 B.C. , thought that the glowing specters were celestial brooms wielded by the gods to sweep the heavens free of evil , which then fell to earth , bringing wars , floods , droughts and other disasters . <P> Comets have borne that stigma ever since . Aristotle thought the night visitors were earthly " exhalations " that rose into the atmosphere and were ignited in fiery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On its pass in A.D. 66 , Halley 's , in the words of the Jewish historian Flavius Josephus , " hung like a sword in the sky " and presaged the fall of Jerusalem in A.D. 70 . Halley 's return in 451 was thought to portend the defeat of Attila the Hun 's armies at Chalons by Flavius Aetius . <P> Comets came to be so closely associated with the deaths of great leaders , says Astronomer Donald Yeomans , that historians waited expectantly for a celestial sign every time a monarch died . When the Emperor Charlemagne expired in 814 and no comet appeared , Yeomans says , " historians made one up and inserted it into history . " <P> Halley 's appearance in 1066 , complete with a forked tail , was stitched into the renowned Bayeux tapestry , which depicted the Norman Conquest . Behind the comet 's tail , above six cringing and pointing figures ( apparently Saxons ) , are the words THEY ARE IN AWE OF THE STAR . While the Saxons may have attributed their defeat to the comet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good omens . In 1301 Halley 's so inspired the Italian artist Giotto that in his famed nativity scene he portrayed the star of Bethlehem as a comet . The comet heralded the descent of Turkish armies on Belgrade in 1456 , and in the same year was blamed for the birth of two-headed calves . <P> Shakespeare 's works reflect the cometary myths of the late 16th and early 17th centuries . In Julius Caesar , for example , the Emperor 's wife , after seeing a comet , warns the noblest of Romans , " When beggars die there are no comets seen ; the heavens themselves blaze forth the death of princes . " But in the same play , as Cassius and Brutus plot Caesar 's assassination , Cassius says , " The fault , dear Brutus , is not in our stars , but in ourselves . " <P> The winds of change , however , were slow to reach Boston , where in 1682 the Puritan minister Increase Mather , awestruck by the same comet that inspired Edmond Halley , asked the members of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God sends his arrows from heaven , to smite them down into the grave .
