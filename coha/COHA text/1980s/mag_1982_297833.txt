Programs providing legal aid to the poor are in need of aid themselves at the moment . Congress cut federal funding by 25% last year . But now Florida and California have come up with a shiny new money source : the funds that are routinely paid in advance by clients and held in escrow bank accounts by their lawyers . When the amounts are small or in the bank for only a short time , they accumulate little or no interest . But pooled , the funds could generate millions in interest . To tap that potential pool , Florida has adopted a voluntary plan that allows any lawyer , without consulting clients , to pass along much of the interest on escrow accounts to Florida Legal Services . So far , about 600 of the state 's 20,000 lawyers have signed up . California likes the interest-bearing idea enough to make it mandatory for most lawyers ' escrow accounts , probably starting this fall-Both states have reason to hope the yield will be significant . A similar plan has been in effect in Canada 's British @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $7.4 million .
