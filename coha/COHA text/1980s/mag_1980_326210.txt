INGRID BERGMAN : MY STORY by Ingrid Bergman and Alan Burgess Delacorte ; 504 pages ; $14.95 <P> Thirty years ago , a U.S. Senator rose in the chamber to denounce the " illicit affair " between a " popular but pregnant Hollywood movie queen " and a " love pirate . " The pirate was the brilliant Italian director Roberto Rossellini ( Open City , Paisan ) . The gravid queen was , of course , Ingrid Bergman , who had arrived in Hollywood from Sweden in 1939 , a hefty 5 ft. 8 in. of raw material crying out for diet , plucked eyebrows and capped teeth . <P> The young Bergman was scarcely a great actress , as David Selznick assured her , but her radiance was irresistible . " Lunching with Ingrid , " said one admiring film critic , " is like sitting down to an hour or so of conversation with an intelligent orchid . " <P> Ingrid 's Swedish husband , Fetter Lindstrom , a brain surgeon , persuaded her to smooth her frown , lay office cream and the fourth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keeping her garrulous mouth shut . On a movie set she stood up to directors ; in real life she was easily led . Someone even had to tell her to abandon her marriage . Combat Photographer Robert Capa , whom she met in Paris after the war , tried . They loved each other , but he was not the marrying sort . <P> Seeing Rossellini 's Open City did it . Overwhelmed by the director 's neorealism , she wrote to offer herself as an actress : the only Italian she knew , she told him , was " ti amo . " Their affair was inevitable , though its bliss was wet with her guilty tears . When she gave birth to Rossellini 's child , Bergman became part of a warm and rackety Italian family , though nothing made up for the loss of young Pia , the daughter she had abandoned in Hollywood . She bore Rossellini a son and twin daughters . But the films she made with him were wretched stuff ; both in art and life , the two were hopelessly mismatched . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a marriage she could not desert . <P> Afterward she divided her life between her children in Rome ( Rossellini got custody ) , a new husband in France and her revived career . If they sometimes had little else to redeem them , the plays and movies she starred in were illuminated by her stately , ageless presence . " Too bad she is n't the queen of some country , " an adoring Goldie Hawn reflected . <P> In 1977 Director Ingmar Bergman forced the 62-year-old Ingrid to unmask herself in Autumn Sonata , a film about a professional pianist who has sacrificed her affections to her career . The actress did not spare the moody Ingmar her frank opinions about his script and direction , but he came to admire this tactless spontaneity that is the key to her nature . Speaking Swedish , her own language , at last , instead of one not perfectly mastered , she gave a scalding performance . <P> Bergman and a capable writer , Alan Burgess , take turns telling her story . She is perfectly straightforward and writes about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blame . <P> - By Eve Auchincloss
