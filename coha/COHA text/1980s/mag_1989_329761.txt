Until last month , when Congress restored its cachet by making it a criminal offense , flag burning had virtually gone out of style as a means of radical protest . Now desecrating the Stars and Stripes has become a bit of a fad . Last week four demonstrators staged a torching on the steps of the U.S. Capitol . Among the participants : Gregory Lee Johnson , whose conviction for setting fire to a flag at the 1984 Republican Convention led to a Supreme Court ruling upholding the constitutionality of the practice . Said Johnson : " We 're back . " <P> The burning was designed to produce a quick challenge to the Flag Protection Act of 1989 , passed by Congress last month amid an orgy of jingoistic rhetoric . If the Supreme Court strikes down the law on constitutional grounds , as seems likely , Congress might be stampeded into approving an anti-flag burning amendment urged by President Bush . It might be wiser to turn down the heat .               @ @ @ @ @ @
