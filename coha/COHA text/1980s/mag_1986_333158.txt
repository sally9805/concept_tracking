Stirred up by President and Mrs. Reagan , antidrug sentiment in America is running at its highest level in a generation . How high will be tested in Oregon in November , when voters will decide on Ballot Measure 5 : Should marijuana be legalized for personal use ? The Oregon Marijuana Initiative has spent about $50,000 promoting the proposition and helping collect the 87,000 signatures necessary to place it on the ballot . John Sajo , 30 , the group 's director , admits , " We 're fighting the general drug hysteria , " but hopes Oregon 's voters will approve the measure , which would allow consumption of pot in homes and its cultivation by individual growers . <P> By some estimates , marijuana , with a potential street value of $2,000 a plant , is Oregon 's largest cash crop . Yet polls show that the proposition is unlikely to pass . Legalizing pot , opponents argue , would make it harder to fight abuse of other drugs and would turn Oregon into America 's largest distributor of the weed .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
