GREASE 2 Directed by Patricia Birch Screenplay by Ken Finkleman <P> What are you going to be when you grow up ? " someone asks a member of the T-Birds , . that small , unmenacing and unamusing'motorcycle gang that turns up in this sequel , along with most of the other bad pennies . from Grease . " A burden on society , " he replies , not understanding that he and everyone connected with both movies have already achieved his life 's ambition . Once again , the cheeky , satirical spirit that animated the hit Broadway show has been dispensed with . The new film , like its predecessor has as its sole aim the corruption of chil dren under the age of 14 . Not that it will impair them morally . No , the aim is to generate false , commercialized nostalgia br what is made to seem a simpler , yet more colorful teen time than their own . The movie strains and strains for the effect Gregory 's Girl achieves without trying , perhaps did not consciously intend . <P> To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 20-year-old pop music , reduced antique dance styles to their simplest components , ignored the authentic texture of language , manners and style except for their most obvious elements . The story is of the same cali ber : Michael , an English lad ( Maxwell Caulfield ) , falls in love with Stephanie ( Michelle Pfeiffer ) , leader of the T-Birds ' hangers-on , the Pink Ladies . Her heart , however , does wheelies for him only when he dresses up as a mysteriously masked motorcyclist , a sort of Lone Ranger on a hawg . He does not reveal his true identity to her until the concluding production number , although the audience is in on the secret all along . Pfeiffer is pretty and has a cer tain spirit about her , but the vacant Caulfield is surely the least promising newcomer since Pia Zadora . The director is Patricia Birch , who choreographed both the Broadway show and the first film . She cuts too much too fast , works too nervously in the musical staging , and veers from the peculiar to the pedestrian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her vision , but then , the whole movie seems to be nothing more than an excuse for a sound-track album . <P> At one point , one of the T-Birds leads a Pink Lady into a fallout shelter in the hope of making out with her there . He explains that the place is for use in case of " nucular . " " Nuclear , " he is corrected . " Nucular , nuclear , a bomb is still a bomb , " he replies . You said it , kid . - RS.
