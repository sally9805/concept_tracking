In walks Mr. Frank ' s partner , an exercise and positive-thinking guru named High Voltage , sort of Norman Vincent Peale ' s brain in Tina Turner ' s body . She wears a magenta body stocking , lime leg warmers and silver booties that look vaguely Martian. // " Is your energy up ? " she demands of a group of women wearing T-shirts commemorating the 65th anniversary of their husbands ' lodge. // " Honey , " one of them responds , " my energy ' s always up . I have to take medication to keep it down . " <> <> Noisy Is Their Name // As different as a gray tuxedo and green sequins , as Sammy Cahn and Twisted Sister , Barry Frank and High Voltage together carry on one of the most venerable traditions in the Catskills . They are tummlers. // A tummler - derived from " tuml , " the Yiddish word for noise - is the hyperkinetic combination of entertainer , social director , merrymaker and matchmaker whose mission , as Leo Rosten wrote in " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the blase ( but insatiable ) patrons of a summer resort that most dubious of vacation boons : ' Never a dull moment. ' " // Decades ago , before Club Med and Disneyland , when today ' s Catskill castles were glorified dairy farms , tummlers were legion . Jerry Lewis , Phil Silvers , Danny Kaye , Moss Hart , Sid Caesar and Henny Youngman all started out as tummlers . They made borscht ( as in belt ) connote a kind of ribald and ridiculous Jewish humor as much as a cold beet concoction. // But things have changed in the Catskills . Hotels book name performers rather than developing their own shows . The clientele is no longer predominantly Jewish . Eleven major resorts began a $100 , 000 advertising campaign this summer in an effort to shed the old image and reinvent themselves as a nondenominational Shangri-La called " Catskilland . " <> <> Borscht , Not Hiltons // At the Raleigh , however , the tummler remains . " I ' m as modern as anyone could be , " said George Gilbert , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than anyone , would ' ve wanted to see the Catskills become a bunch of Hiltons . But why not say ' borscht belt ' ? That ' s what we are. " // Mr. Frank , the Brooklyn-born son of a hosiery salesman , represents the classic tummler . He wears a gold chai charm , sings an Al Jolson medley and asserts , " I never played any dumps . " Ms. Voltage , with her rap songs and aerobics classes , puts a distinctly 1980 ' s stamp on the profession . Although there is no historical research to confirm it , she is believed to be the first tummler with a blond Mohawk haircut. // Mr. Frank learned his trade from people with names like Jackie Phillips and Billy Hodes , who taught him how to run a bingo game , how to introduce an act , how to coax the recalcitrant onto the dance floor . And Mr. Frank , in turn , initiated Ms. Voltage into the Catskills and tummling. // " I kept hearing this word - how do you pronounce it ? - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t know what it was . I thought they were asking me if I tumbled . But when they told me what a tummler ' s functions were , I said , ' Well , that ' s what I do . ' " <> <> Julius LaRosa , the Ballplayer // Still , there were refinements , for Ms. Voltage ' s world had been Manhattan - talk shows , press kits , teaching aerobics at the Excelsior Club , partying at the Saint . Last November , on her first weekend at the Raleigh , Mr. Frank introduced her to the singer Julius LaRosa . " Who do you play ball for ? " she asked him. // Mr. Gilbert reminded her of the personal touch that is the tummler ' s trademark - remembering names , visiting each table , fussing over children . " I ' ve learned to be more - what ' s the word ? - haimishe ? " she said , using the Yiddish term for folksiness and not mangling it too terribly. // In a sense , Ms. Voltage and Mr. Frank form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ share nothing but a certain mutual respect . Ms. Voltage is a vegetarian who says she eschews all things white - " sugar , salt , flour , coke . " Mr. Frank , a man with a taste for kreplach , sighs , " Chubby is beautiful. " // When Ms. Voltage leads a nature hike , it is an " energy walk . " When she teaches an exercise class , it is an " energy concert . " When she gives a pep talk it is a " zap rap . " Rarely do 10 minutes pass at the Raleigh without her thrusting her clenched fist skyward and shouting , " Energy up ! " <> <> Lip-Sync for ' Love Bites ' // Ms. Voltage also has brought the Raleigh a lip-sync contest modeled on the television show " Putting on the Hits . " Fame ' s aspirants on one recent evening included a young man named Jonathan who wore mirror sunglasses and a sleeveless black T-shirt for his rendition of a Judas Priest ditty entitled " Love Bites. " // " That ' s very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over . " Is that rock ' n ' roll ? " " Heavy metal , " Jonathan informed her . Mr. Frank is less the exhorter , more the convincer . He teaches a dance class beside the pool , instructing on the fine points of the skate , the limbo and the Suzy-Q . He leads sing-alongs and lawn games , emcees two shows a night on weekends , and does his own act during the week . His theme song is " The Best of Times. " // He easily roams the dining room , dispensing comments and quips like a waiter dropping off relish trays . " This must be the healthy table , everybody has salads , " or " He ' s a vice principal . He ' s in charge of all the vice in his school , " or " Fort Lee ? I know lots of people in Fort Lee . Corbett Monica lives in Fort Lee . " <> <> ' She Makes Me Feel Normal ' // At first Mr. Frank wondered how he and Ms. Voltage would work together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like Voltage , " he said , " is that she makes me feel normal . " As for Ms. Voltage , when the Raleigh began running advertisements with her name and photograph , touting her as " first lady of energy , " she insisted to Mr. Gilbert that the ads include Mr. Frank , too. // But they are headed in different directions . Ms. Voltage , like so many tummlers before her , sees the Catskills as a jumping-off point . In her 30 ' s , that still seems possible . She already has a theme song and an accompanying video in production , and she drops names from Gloria Steinem to the rap singer Kurtis Blow. // Mr. Frank , though , has seen his moments come and go . He is 55 years old now , and he sounds uncharacteristically wistful as he sits beside the Raleigh ' s pool and mentions a few songs he recorded in the 1950 ' s , songs , he said , that became hits for other performers. // " I think that ' s why I ended up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' I ' m tired of trying to make it . ' I decided it was time to come back , to do something I loved. " //
