THE NATIONS The Siege <P> The incessant roar of the planes-that typical and terrible 20th Century sound , a voice of cold mechanized anger-filled every ear in the city . It reverberated in the bizarre stone ears of the hollow , broken houses ; it throbbed in the weary ears of Berlin 's people who were bitter , afraid , but far from broken ; it echoed in the intently listening ear of history . The sound meant one thing : the West was standing its ground and fighting back . <P> The crucial battle for Berlin was being fought in the hearts and minds of Berliners-but first &; foremost in their bellies . The Russians were attempting to starve into submission 2 million people in the city 's Western sectors . They had been driven to employ a weapon which disgraced them before the civilized world . The Americans and the British were trying to feed the Berliners-by air . <P> At Tempelhof Airport the occasional shiny C-54s and many battered C-47s landed at the daylight rate of one every three minutes . Scores of ten-ton trucks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ G.I.s and German workers labored 24 hours a day to get them unloaded . In the orange and white control tower , 13 G.I.s worked around the clock , surrounded by Coke bottles , cigarette smoke , and the brassy chattering of radios . The chaotic chorus of American voices was tense but happy ; America was in its element . " Give me an ETA on EC 84 . . . That 's flour coming in on EC 72 . . . Roger . . . Ease her down . . . Where the hell has 85 gone ? Oh yeah , overhead . . . " <P> With these voices in the battle of Berlin mingled many others . In Washington , U.S. Secretary of State George Marshall said : " We intend to stay . " <P> The man who , along with his G.I.s , had to do most of the staying was a general from Georgia with sad brown eyes , courtly manners and a steel-trap will . He was General Lucius DuBignon Clay , Commander of U.S. Forces in Europe , and he had already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Berlin first began , he said : " The American troops under my command will use force of arms if necessary . I have firmly made up my mind that I will not be bluffed . " <P> Overhead , the roar of the planes continued day &; night . <P> <P> SAINTS &; HEROES <P> Of Truth and Shame <P> A stocky young man in grey slacks , a blue pullover and khaki bush jacket stepped forward and knelt at Gandhi 's feet . He was Nathu Ram Vinayak Godse , editor of the extremist newspaper Hindu Rashtra , which had denounced Gandhi as an appeaser of Moslems . " You are late today for the prayer , " said the murderer . <P> <P> " Yes , I am , " said Gandhi . Godse suddenly pulled out a tiny Beretta automatic pistol . He fired three times . One bullet ripped into Gandhi 's chest , two into his belly . With hands folded , as if welcoming the blow , in the gesture that is both the Hindu greeting and the Christian attitude of prayer , Gandhi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ai Ram " ( O Rama , O Rama ) , in invocation to the gentle hero of the Hindu pantheon , Gandhi 's favorite .
