America Aglow <P> To the Editors : <P> <P> I am elated . Your " America 's Upbeat Mood " NATION , Sept. 24 article captures the essence of the prevailing U.S. spirit . How refreshing to read that we are celebrating our nation and that displaying affection for our country is in vogue . This radiating sentiment invigorates and livens our communities . It rejuvenates our purpose as a nation . <P> <P> Michael Todd Miller Nashville <P> What is wrong with patriotism ? Probably nothing , unless it is a guise for mass escapism . Given the spiraling deficit , the nuclear arms buildup , the decline of the middle class , I think the current " glow " will be short-lived . Sooner or later we are going to have to face reality . <P> <P> Clark D. Mueller Florence , Ala . <P> <P> The current upbeat and patriotic mood of the nation is in large measure attributable to President Reagan . He has told us what is right about us and about the country . It stands to reason that , after being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Americans would think kindly of a man who could tell them what is right about themselves . <P> <P> Robert C. McClure Lake Jackson , Texas <P> The joy of freedom is what makes me love the U.S. <P> Eric Troxell Ashville , Pa . <P> I feel quite loyal to America , but I am still waiting to be proud of it . <P> Sharla Vohs Oakland , Calif . <P> <P> As a Canadian , I believe that my fellow citizens enjoy as much personal freedom and almost as much prosperity as Americans . Thus I regard the present surge of patriotism in the U.S. as a harmless if naive and tactless exercise in self-congratulation . I become quite frightened , however , at the memory of what other powerful nations have done in the past when they became convinced they had exclusive title to truth , freedom , justice or some other great moral virtue . <P> <P> Edwin R. Kammin Waltham , Mass . <P> <P> Instead of making ourselves stronger economically , we are getting deeper and deeper into debt . Right now some people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to hear , read and believe only what they think is good , whether it is true or not . Would you call that a basis for renewed pride ? <P> <P> Emma DeGoey Reseda , Calif . <P> <P> Americans should feel up . We deserve to feel good . <P> <P> Joe Wilharms Menasha , Wis . <P> <P> Your article describing America 's upbeat mood cites patriotism for the increase in military enlistment . In our area , high school graduates who can not afford the increasing cost of a college education have two options : a minimum-wage job or military service . Military service provides better pay , as well as benefits that can not be found in the private sector . <P> <P> Stephen Meredith Tecumseh , Mich . <P> <P> I am a German who has lived in the U.S. for only a few months . Pride in being a member of a nation is not bad . But I notice that this feeling blocks out everything outside the U.S. Your nation is a beautiful and powerful one . Yet it is part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affects the U.S. , and vice versa . I think Americans should be more aware of this . <P> <P> Joerg Boese Atlanta <P> Delicate Difference
