The massive logs , gnarled stumps and matted leaves lying half buried on the rock-strewn hillside make it clear that a thick forest once stood there , trees that grew 150 ft. high and lived 1,000 years . " You can read the rings  --  they look modern , like a lush forest area logged fairly recently , " says Paleobotanist James Basinger of the University of Saskatchewan . " But then ) you look around , and you 're in a desert . The only trees are dwarf willows one and two inches high . " The sparse growth surrounding the half square mile of fallen trees is not surprising : the location is Axel Heiberg Island , less than 700 miles from the North Pole in the Canadian Arctic , an arid , frigid region hardly conducive to the growth of any vegetation , let alone large trees . Then how did a forest thrive ? The answer , says Basinger , is that the stumps and logs are 45 million years old , remnants of trees that grew when Axel Heiberg Island  --  and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age , the stumps , logs and leaves are astonishingly well preserved . " This fossil forest is not petrified , turned to stone by minerals entering and replacing the wood cell structure , " says Neil McMillan , of the Geological Survey of Canada , who discovered a similar but much smaller site 30 years ago on nearby Ellesmere Island . Instead , shallow burial in the Arctic soil has left the forest in a mummified state . As a result , says Basinger , " you can saw the wood . You can burn it . " Indeed , during an expedition to the site in July , he actually brewed a pot of tea over burning fossil debris . <P> The fossil forest should also fuel some important scientific research . " You can see a prehistoric forest in a growth condition : how dense it was , how the trees grew , how productive it was , " Basinger says . " It gives us a much better idea of the plants populating the high latitudes ( at that time ) , the kind of environment there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <P> First to spot the fossil forest was Paul Tudge , a helicopter pilot who has been ferrying Geological Survey scientists to and from remote sites on Axel Heiberg and Ellesmere for years . He had once seen McMillan 's fossil forest , and on a flight to Axel Heiberg in July 1985 , Tudge recalls , " I saw the same sort of stumps , but many , many of them . " He later returned to the site , landed nearby , collected samples and brought them to Basinger , who immediately began planning this summer 's expedition . Aided by a grant from the Geological Survey and accompanied by another fossil-forest specialist , Jane Francis , from Australia 's University of Adelaide , he spent two weeks in July investigating the ancient forest . <P> The scientists shoveled away soil covering some of the mummified wood , then used brushes to sweep away the remaining dirt so the roots of the ancient stumps would not be damaged . All told , they excavated a dozen stumps to a depth of three feet , identifying some of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throughout high latitudes in North America , Europe and Asia , but is now nearly extinct , surviving in only a few locations in China .
