Juggling players deftly , Baltimore had a winning look <P> Undeniably the best player in baseball is the leftfielder for the Baltimore Orioles . He was the best last year when he slugged 41 homers and knocked in 123 runs , and he was the best this year when he had 35 home runs and 130 RBIs . The fact that he happens to be a composite of several different characters , for the most part Lefthanded Hitter John Lowenstein and Righthander Gary Roenicke , is a bit befuddling , but it begins to describe the 80th World Series . <P> The Orioles arrived at this glory in place of the Chicago White Sox thanks largely to Roenicke , who batted .750 and hit an important home run in the American League playoffs . For his reward , he was benched the first two Series games with Philadelphia and displaced by Lowenstein , who made a marvelous catch in Game 1 , hit a mighty homer in Game 2 , and was replaced by Roenicke in Game 3 . " I do n't want to play the third @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is pitching . " That is a typically reasonable reaction for an Oriole , especially Lowenstein , who never says , " I hit a home run , " rather , " I immobilized the outfielders , " and who regards personal records lightly . As he says , " All statistics will be rendered meaningless at the outset of World War III . " <P> This is not the attitude of the National League champion Philadelphia Phillies , veterans of slightly smaller wars . The Phillies likewise share positions but grudgingly . Centerfielder Garry Maddox hit the winning homer in Game 1 ( 2-1 ) and said , " I honestly did n't think I 'd still be here by now . I have not accepted this platooning role . I do n't want to be that kind of player next year . " Maddox watched from the bench as Baltimore won the second game , 4-1 . <P> When the venerable first baseman Pete Rose , 42 , was shelved in Game 3 in favor of equally honorable and creaky Tony Perez , 41 , Rose felt " hurt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his beautiful career , Rose batted only .245 and was beaten out during the crunch of the race by recent Minor Leaguer Len Matuszek , who had been promoted too late to qualify for postseason play . Rose says , " I 'm nothing if not a team man . I did n't have to move from second base to left field in 1967 to make room for Tommy Helms ; I did n't have to move from left to third base in 1975 to make room for George Foster ; I did have to move from third to first base in 1979 to make room for me . " Back for Game 4 , he cracked two singles . <P> Plainly , although Rose is crouched just ten hits from 4,000 , only 201 behind Ty Cobb , there is no room for him in Philadelphia any more . One day next month , the Phillies must commit to another $1 million for Rose or sever him at $300,000 . While management insists that no decision has been made , Rose simply does not believe that , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a chance to win , because I do n't think I could play if there was no chance to win . " Or maybe it is time for him " to swim to Japan . " With Rose on the bench even for a day , it seemed odd to think that a World Series was going on , the composite classic where even the managers came in twos and threes .
