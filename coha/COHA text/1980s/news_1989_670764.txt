For lack of funds to assess current sexual attitudes and actions , health experts , including those trying to stem the spread of AIDS , have had to rely on data gathered by Dr. Alfred Kinsey 30 to 50 years ago and on magazine-sponsored surveys among skewed samples of people who volunteered to participate . Much of this information may be incomplete or erroneous. // Several recent studies indicate that sexual practices among Americans are now quite different from what previous surveys revealed . For example , a regional study recently suggested that an unexpectedly high percentage of American women regularly engage in anal intercourse , a practice believed to pose an increased risk of transmission of the AIDS virus . Another study found that many gay men and women have intercourse with members of the opposite sex. // Now , as AIDS threatens a widening circle of Americans , the Federal Government is preparing to conduct a major national survey of sexual habits and attitudes among 20 , 000 people chosen at random . A proposed $2. 1 million pilot test of the survey is being evaluated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approve proposals for and questionnaires used in all surveys conducted by the Government. // The pilot study would be conducted among 2 , 300 people by the National Opinion Research Center of the University of Chicago and would test various ways of eliciting truthful information about the most private aspects of people ' s lives . The final study , if approved , could cost $15 million. // Until the budget office acts , the scientists involved in the project declined to discuss it for fear that publicity would generate instant opposition and prevent a fair hearing on its scientific merits. // A spokeswoman for the survey ' s sponsoring agency , the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development , said , " The entire project could be torpedoed if O.M.B. doesn ' t like the questionnaire or the idea of conducting a study like this . " The proposed survey has already been ridiculed by two nationally syndicated newspaper columnists after it was described in the journal Science last month. // However , sexologists and other health professionals insist that new and better data on sexual habits and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Small studies among selected groups have already strongly indicated that mistaken beliefs abound and that these misconceptions could hinder efforts to control sexually related health problems. // For example , a 1988 study of a random sample of women in Los Angeles County by Dr. Gail Wyatt , a medical psychologist at the University of California at Los Angeles , revealed that for one woman in four , the first experience at intercourse occurred through rape . Another study completed last April among nearly 2 , 000 white middle-class women in the Southwest found that 23. 8 percent regularly and willingly engaged in anal intercourse , a much larger number than the 8 to 10 percent that previous data had suggested. // In other studies sponsored by the Kinsey Institute for Sex Research at Indiana University , about two-thirds of homosexual men reported having at one time engaged in heterosexual intercourse , 70 percent reported having sex with a married man and 20 percent said they had had sex with six or more married men . In addition , 45 percent of lesbian women said they had sex with men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You can ' t rely on self-labeling or risk groups because sexual behavior passes across identification boundaries , " said Harold Lief , marriage and sex counselor at the University of Pennsylvania . " It ' s behavior , not risk groups , that really counts. " // For example , he said many Mexican-American men of mixed Indian and European heritage who have anal intercourse with other men do not consider themselves homosexual unless they are the receptive partners . Anal intercourse is often used to preserve the " virginity " of women with similar heritage , he added. // Earlier this month , an expert panel of the National Academy of Science ' s National Research Council looking into AIDS prevention , urged Federal agencies to sponsor more research on sexual behavior , including the sexual activity of homosexual men , teen-agers , bisexuals and divorced people , the frequency of monogamy and the variations in sex acts among different groups of people . <> <> Myths and Misinformation // Debra Haffner , director of the Sex Information and Education Council of the United States , said a properly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the need for contraceptive services and more accurately target education programs to prevent AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases. // Further , she said , a study like this could bring sexuality , which is still very much a secret subject , more into the realm of public discourse and counter the misinformation , myths , ignorance and pain millions of people now experience regarding sexuality. // Dr. Richard Green , a professor of psychiatry and law at the University of California at Los Angeles and an expert on aberrant sexual development , agreed . " The field of sexual science has been handicapped by mythology for decades , " he said . As a lawyer and sexologist , Dr. Green said he would expect a new survey to shed light on the relevance of sex laws , such as statutes that ban sodomy . For example , if anal intercourse is found to be practiced more by heterosexuals than homosexuals , using the sodomy statutes to prosecute gays would be discriminatory , he said. // Dr. John Money , an expert on sexual development at the Johns Hopkins University School @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basis for establishing sexual health programs for children and teen-agers in which distortions in sexual development could be caught early and perhaps corrected. // " We first need to know what is normal , " he said . " We need to find out how early sex play and fantasies correlate with adult behavior , and at what age and under what circumstances distortions in sexual development tend to occur . Only then can we determine when and how to intervene . " <> <> Sexual Programming in Marriage // Dr. Money also believes a thorough sex survey could be used to help alleviate sexual conflicts that often doom marriages . What are the normal differences between men and women in sexual arousal , enhancements and barriers to sexual expression and links between love and sex ? How many marriages fail because of incapability in sexual programming in wives and husbands ? // Still , he and other sexologists fear that unless a sex survey is done by highly trained interviewers and included adequate representation of the many subcultures of Americans , it will be unlikely to yield unbiased and reliable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opinions on toxic wastes are not automatically qualified to ask about activities that usually are not even discussed with close friends and that may involve socially proscribed or even illegal behavior. // While special training is planned for the interviewers , June Machover Reinisch , director of the Kinsey Institute , has found that it often takes six months to one year for interviewers to become sufficiently comfortable with sexuality to solicit information without implying judgment. // " If the person being interviewed senses that the interviewer is uncomfortable with the topic , he or she will simply stop talking about it , " she said. //
