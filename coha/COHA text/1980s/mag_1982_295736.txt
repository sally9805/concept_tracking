FRANCE Combat Rations Furor over defense cuts <P> First came an extraordinary confidential letter from the top army commander to France 's military leadership , leaked last week to Le Matin , a usually pro-government daily . Proposed cuts in defense spending by Francois Mitterrand 's Socialist government , wrote General Jean Delaunay , would eliminate more than 30,000 troops from the 314,000-man army , leading to a force " weakened in its structure , aging in its equipment and wounded in its morale . " Then came other leaked statements by the air force and navy chiefs of staff , revealing what they said were still secret government studies of making major cutbacks in military manpower and procurement between 1984 and 1988 . The result , : hey claimed , would be grave damage to France 's defenses . As public furor over the spending cuts mounted , Premier Pierre Mauroy responded angrily , calling the disclosures part of a political " operation cooked up to cast doubt on the government 's will to defend the country . " <P> The uproar comes in the midst of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to giving he military whatever it demands , in a country where patriotism and the armed forces are nearly synonymous , Frenchmen are now questioning that practice in the face of rising budget pressures . Earlier this month neo-Gaullist Deputy Pierre Messmer , a former Defense Minister under Charles de Gaulle , led a censure motion against the Mitterrand government 's defense policy in the National Assembly . Messmer attacked the " mere 15% " of public spending devoted to the military as " the weakest figure since the second World War . " The Socialists used their majority to defeat the motion , but in the Assembly debate Mauroy had to concede that possible changes in manpower levels were indeed being considered . <P> For the Socialists , reducing military spending represents a sharp turnabout . When Mitterrand was swept into power last year , he delighted France 's NATO allies , and mollified suspicious right-wing opponents at home , by making it clear that he would strengthen the nation 's defense effort . At a time when most of the allies were cutting back , Mitterrand proposed a hefty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4% after inflation . Since then , the gray realities of recession have taken their toll . Defense Minister Charles Hernu , relying on a government decree , hacked a total of $2.5 billion from the current $17.1 billion military budget and from future procurement . The move will , among other things , delay by a year the delivery of the air force 's first 25 Mirage 2000 combat planes . <P> Hernu last month pushed through the National Assembly a hold-the-line 1983 budget that calls for total appropriations of $18.5 billion , an increase roughly equal to inflation . He called it a " transitional " allocation that would not affect the new five-year defense plan due early next year .
