Several hundred Cuban refugees are already starting a new life . In the neighboring towns of Union City and West New York , N.J. , many storefront signs are written in Spanish , and men sit in restaurants sipping cafe cubano . With 69,000 immigrants , many of whom fled here in the 1960s , this area has the largest Cuban community in the U.S. outside Miami , and many of the established exiles have opened their homes to the newcomers .
