AUGUSTA , Ga . - Raymond Floyd ' s day in the 47th Masters Golf Tournament at the Augusta National GC began with two pars in the early-morning breezes , included a nap and a subsequent excercise in survival . " I was out here early , " said Floyd . " I saw how windy it was . I expected some of the younger players would have a problem . I figured par would be a good score . " The two pars finished Round 2 for Floyd , one of six who had run out of daylight in the Saturday evening calm after two days of rain . The nap broke up the time between the end of the second round and the start of the third , and Floyd ' s prediction was right on the money as he went out in the swirling winds and was one of just 10 golfers to break par . Because he did - with a 1-under-par 71 for a 6-under 210 total - andbecause the scores reflected the difficulties of playing on a course that was remarkably dry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stadler , whose 69 was the day ' s low round . They share a one-shot edge over Severiano Ballesteros ( 73-211 ) entering the rescheduled final round - with a record first prize of $90,000 . What emerged yesterday was what Floyd had alluded to : Masters experience . Tom Watson ( 71-212 ) is tied for fourth with 22-year-old Georgian Jodie Mudd , and that top-five slice of the leader board features four men who have won the Masters before . Floyd , 1976 . Stadler , the defending champion . Ballesteros , 1980 . Watson , 1977 and 1981 . The **32;0;TOOLONG lineup is professional golf ' s most consistent in recent history . Meanwhile , the storybook saga of South Yarmouth ' s Jim Hallet - who earned low amateur honors by making the cut - shot his highest round in the 13 he has played since arriving here March 30 . He fell from a tie for seventh to a tie for 28th with a run of 68-73-78- 219 . He played the third round with Stadler yesterday afternoon , his fourth pairing with a Masters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and with Arnold Palmer and Ballesteros on Saturday and yesterday morning ' s second- round finish . Hallet and Palmer - the four-time Masters winner who had stirred up the echoes at the age of 53 - had been center stage until they ran into the realities of yesterday . Hallet shot himself out of it with four straight bogeys starting at the seventh hole . Palmer had a round that included a double bogey on the 10th , seven bogeys , three birdies and an eagle on the 13th for 76-218 . So the story becomes Stadler , The Walrus . He ' s out to become the second to repeat in the 49-year history of the Masters . Jack Nicklaus , who was forced to withdraw Saturday due to back spasms , did it in 1965-66 . " I know I can win on this golf course , " said Stadler , " and it makes Sunday a little easier . " Stadler ' s golf year seemed to have turned around last week in Greensboro , N.C. He had been struggling , the tour ' s leading money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he borrowed a putter from Ben Crenshaw , regained his touch on the greens and arrived in a confident frame of mind . " I ' ve got my mind on golf and golf only , " he said yesterday . " It ' s night and day from the way it was two weeks ago . " Floyd , who was second to Stadler on the 1982 money list , thought he let some chances slip away on seven holes . But he played the final seven holes 1- under par . He won golf ' s last major - the PGA at Southern Hills - and he ' s notoriously dangerous when he ' s in front and feeling right . " The only way you can win a major championship , " said Floyd , " is to give yourself a chance . I ' m here . I ' ve given myself a chance . That ' s always been the hardest thing for me . The reason I play well when I ' m in contention is good playing has gotten me there and I don @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in with my game in order . " Ballesteros saw an eagle bid on the 13th turn into a 3-putt par , but he rolled in a 15-footer on the 18th . " I feel I played very well , " he said , " but I didn ' t think my putter was as good as it normally is . " Watson ' s presence is an intimidating one . He has been the game ' s best player over the past six years and yesterday pointed out that he wasn ' t at the top of his game when he won the Masters in 1980 . And he gave the leaders something to think about when he said , " I ' m encouraged by the way I ' m scoring . "
