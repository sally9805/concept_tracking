THE TALK OF THE TOWN Notes and Comment ALE C WILDER ' S dying on Christ- mass Eve would have given him rueful amusement , for he did not celebrate Christmas  --  or his birthday ( he would have been seventy-four in February ) or any day except the day the skunk cabbage first came up in the spring . This was not because he had Scrooge tendencies . He simply considered such events artificial . In the same way , he abhorred cant , snobbery , fakery , egocentricity , fawning , pomp , social climbing , cleverness , and fashion . Nor could he abide bad taste , selfishness , unkindness , greed , rudeness , jealousy , or vanity  --  although , like any sound practicing moralist , he was guilty of them all at one time or another . He found the twentieth century in general cheap and trivial and mindless . He yearned for some sort of Kilvertian life , in which he could parcel out his time into composing his music , riding on steam trains , building gardens , writing letters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was expert ) , reading ( Eudora Welty , E. F. Benson , Sylvia Townsend Warner , Peter De Vries ) , and endlessly talking and laughing . His longing for a pastoral nineteenth-century existence was so strong that most of what he accomplished was nineteenth-century in nature . And yet , for a man so impatient with his own times , he gave those times a great deal . He wrote hundreds of popular songs , the best of them ( " The Sounds Around the House , " " Blackberry Winter , " " Who Can I Turn To ? " ) gentle , graceful melodies , close to lieder in their elegance and subtlety , and matching the best of Jerome Kern and George Gershwin and Harold Arlen , who was his god . He was the first composer to attempt to break down the barrier between jazz and formal music , by writing a series of outrageously titled octets ( " Jack , This Is My Husband , " " The House Detective Registers " ) , for oboe , clarinet , bass clarinet , bassoon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which are a larking mixture of jazz rhythms and timbres and formal forms and instrumentation . During his last twenty-five years or so , his love of Bach and Ravel and Debussy , and which was coveted by such great performers as Harvey Phillips and John Barrows and Bernard Garfield . He wrote for every instrument in the orchestra , and in surprising combinations : trios for oboe , clarinet , and bassoon , and for clarinet , horn , and piano ; suites for three guitars , for trombone choir and clarinet choir , and for horn , tuba , and piano . When he was blocked and could not compose ( about every second year ) , he wrote prose , some of it Shavian , some of it Dickensian . He wrote thousands of letters , he wrote short stories , he wrote a still unpublished but reportedly hilarious backstairs history of the Algonquin Hotel , and he wrote a masterwork , " American Popular Song : The Great Innovators . " In it he set down acute , witty judgments of nearly a thousand of the worthiest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If originality is the filling of an empty space , what " American Popular Song " did was entirely original . He gave away almost everything that came into his hands  --  books ( bought in great numbers at Scribners bookstore ) , recordings , awards , gifts , photographs of himself , pens and pencils , and even his music , much of which he wrote for friends and proteges . Commercialism revolted him , and he never made much money . Yet he managed to live a reasonably comfortable nomadic life , at the Algonquin ; at the One Eleven East Avenue Hotel in Rochester , the city where he was born ; in Key West ; and in the homes of friends . He once described this way of life in a let-ter : Though I do n't feel the least bit freakish , I suppose that to even the most understanding , tolerant people ... I must seem distinctly odd . 1 keep forgetting that I do very few of the things which constitute conventional living . I do n't go to the theatre , movies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or listen to radio . I have no property or stocks or insurance . I have no family but a niece and nephew I never see and a brother to whom I an as close as to a mild-mannered short-order conk . I see no friends constantly , only when I 'm in their city .... 1 have no memorabilia , clippings , reviews , photographs , records , printed or manuscript music . I keep only the letters of one man . I refuse to contemplate the past or the future . I have no plans , no ambitions or infatuations .... I assume that the worst is likely to occur at any moment and therefore celebrate not so much feeling 1AT 11 as not feeling sick .... Since I have reduced my needs and inter-em to a minimum , there will be that much less to die . He wrote letters by the dozen when he was blocked , and they were bits and pieces of himself . Whether they were philosophical or funny or hyperbolic or lyrical , they were always ' Ilea . They seemed written in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , his shouting laugh , his " No ! I do n't believe it ! " when he was told something that tickled him . ( He was an excessively shy man who camou- flaged his disability with a lot of noise . ) You could see him  --  the long , warm , tired , handsome face , the flying hair , the glittering coal eyes , the heedless uniform of sports jacket , gray flannels , and brown loafers . The concentration in his letters reminded you of his selfless concentration when he listened to other people 's music , which he did with his eyes clamped shut , his mouth downturned , his chin held in the fork of a thumb and forefinger . He once wrote of the guitarist Jim Hall , " There is to me a strange difference between Jim Hall and other jazz musicians . It is as if he were so marvelously disciplined as to be able to choose his notes from a long accumulated and even hoarded wisdom  --  that kind of wisdom that is reached by having intelligently absorbed from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notes seem to be transmuted from memories of joy , misery , mistakes , realizations , humilities , and wonderments . " Alec Wilder rightly considered a sense of humor the ability to poke fun at yourself , and he did that constantly , in the flesh and in his letters . He loved to tell the story of the stranger who approached him in the Algonquin lobby and praised him with such reverence that it made him feel weak-kneed and ridiculous . Immediately afterward , when he was climbing into a cab to go to the airport , he asked the bell-man helping him what he was laughing at , and got this reply : " He thought you were Thornton . " Here is a typical self-snicker from a letter : In my fathomless ( less in depth than incomprehensibility ) brain , I can summon up rose trellises , tow-headed children , rocking chairs , and raffish-eyed birds which shout " Good morning ! " And in that multi-circuited mess there is the shape of a slate which I wiggle designs on and wipe clean whenever new space @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am not well-informed , but 1 know too much . He could be unashamedly poetic  --  a Robert Louis Stevenson who really dug children , because he was , in many ways , still a child himself : The slice of sky I once cut out and gave to a three-year-old who carried it off to a hiding place ... From time to time , nostalgia seized him , the unflappable realist : I suppose as the years increase , one requires more and more sideshows , sleight-of-hand moments , meaningless but cheery interruptions , nonsense phone calls , expectations such as being invited to ... visit in Sylvia Townsend Warner 's English village home . Oh , how splendid it would be to look up and sec a joyous group of faces , the kind one constantly saw in the twenties , foolish , innocent ... girls ' faces that were more like fiction than fact . As Alec Wilder himself was . Perennials REHEARSAL : We dropped by the Uris Theatre to attend a rehearsal of the New York Shakespeare Festival 's new version of Gilbert and Sullivan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it is shaping up as the very model of a modern , acoustically reinforced Broadway musical . All big musicals are miked and mixed these days , because producers prefer a modern sound and stage voices are n't what they used to be , but this " Pirates , " which was originally presented outdoors at the Delacorte Theatre last summer , is a unique experiment in using amplification to bring up to date the musical character of a nineteenth-century score . Although Gilbert 's words have survived the change intact , the orchestra that Sullivan wrote for has been replaced by a contemporary pop ensemble , conducted by William Elliott and consisting of brasses , woodwinds , electronic keyboards , percussion instruments ( xylophones , vibraphones , cymbals , boohams , a trap set , timpani , and a concert bass drum ) , and  --  with a nod to tradition  --  two string basses . Two of the leading singers  --  Linda Ronstadt and Rex Smith  --  come from the superarnplified world of pop music , where a microphone is regarded as an extra vocal cord . Four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Azito , and George Rose  --  have been trained for the stage but display light singing voices that can use an acoustical boost . What results from this unlikely mixture of styles is a choreographed farce that is sung and acted in a beguilingly naturalistic manner , with every syllable coming through clearly and every bit of musical punctuation reverberatJANUARY 12.1981 ing through the hall like the inner voices of a Wagnerian score . To create these complex aural effects , we learned when we arrived at the rehearsal , takes seventy-two microphones , three dozen loudspeakers , a mixing console , a sound mixer , a sound designer , and lots of very hard work . The " Pirates " stage  --  an octagonal wooden platform that has steps on two sides leading down to a ramp that runs along the outer edge of the orchestra pit  --  bristled with spiderlike black standing microphones . There was a row of " foot mikes " at the front of the platform , and a second row of them farther front , along the outer edge of the ramp . There were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rifle barrels  --  pointed down at the playing area from two large hanging banks of lights on either side of the stage . And there were also microphones hidden in a Rousseaulike seascape at the back of the platform and still others in two offstage vocal booths , where groups of singers were stationed to augment the sound of a dancing chorus . Each instrument in the orchestra was miked. individually ( the sounds were mixed and balanced at the console ) , and each of nine solo voices in the cast was equipped with a " wireless " ? a tiny mike clipped to the chest and attached by , of all things , a wire to a small transmitter containing batteries and an antenna . Don Ketteler , the sound designer , told us that the wireless sets  --  which are checked and equipped with new batteries before every act  --  were very tricky to handle . " What we aim for is a little beyond simple reinforcement , " he said . " We try to get a sound that is as pleasant and forceful as possible , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the audience  --  each sound image in its proper place onstage . " We left Mr. Ketteler studying some new combinations on the console and walked down to the front of the auditorium , where we found Wilford Leach , a tall , scholarly man , who is the director of the show , and the famous pop singer Linda Ronstadt , a small , bouncy brunette , who plays the heroine , Mabel , discussing her first-act entrance . " I think I 've fixed my cadenza , " said Miss Ronstadt , who has short , shaggy hair and large , inscrutable brown eyes , " but could we try the entrance in the preview tonight without that big fanfare ? " " We can try it with the small fanTHE NEW YORKER fare , " said Mr. Leach soothingly . " But that does n't help much , because the applause you get when you come in always covers up part of the cadenza. " " lArell , if there 's stunned silence tonight I 'll go right on , " Miss Ronstadt said , with a smile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you on , " said Mr. Leach , " and let the audience applaud when you 've finished singing . " As Mr. Leach turned his attention to the acoustical problems posed by a rapidly moving female chorus , we asked Miss Ronstadt how she had changed her vocal technique to handle a different kind of music . " It 's not altogether a new way of singing for me , " she said . " I 've always had pretty good diction ; in pop work you emphasize consonants and sibilants . Here , too , I have to hit the consonants very hard . Acoustically , there 's no problem , because I 'm used to microphones and very large sports stadiums , and I 'm used to singing by braille  --  by the feel in my throat  --  with the deafening din of a rock band behind me . I always knew I had a soprano , but pop stuff uses mainly texture and chest tones , and the thing I 'm working on at the moment is the technical organization that moves your voice from one register @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maybe even three  --  voices : a pop one , which conies from the chest ; an in-between one ; and a soprano , which goes up to high F. " A few minutes later , the orchestra hit a muted fanfare and Miss Ronstadt made her first-act entrance , singing a florid coloratura cadenza that sounded like Rossini and ended with the words " ' T is Mabel . " Then she stopped to allow for applause and asked the conductor to give her a downbeat for the next line . " Linda , " said Mr. Leach , " will you try it again , holding off your entrance until the bel'i Let me see what it looks like . " Miss Ronstadt repeated her entrance , singing the entire cadenza offstage and appearing through some painted trees on the last syllable . The effect was instant theatrical magic , and everyone in the theatre applauded . " That eliminates the problem of applause covering the cadenza , " said Mr. Leach . " Let 's try it tonight . " When the rehearsal was over , we asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Gilbert and Sullivan . " These musical pieces  --  like the plays of Shakespeare  --  have become encrusted with a lot of notions about how they ought to be played , " he told us . " But the aesthetic factors are different now from what they were in the eighteen-eighties , and while you can restore the traditional way of doing a play , you ca n't restore the traditional audience that experienced it . Pirates ' was popular theatre in its day , and I thought that it should be recreated to reach the same kind of popular audience . So we started by concentrating on the material and trying to respond directly to it , in order to recapture the kind of rough vitality that is characteristic of any new work of art . We have used the individuality of pop voices to duplicate the impact that the original work had on the original audience , and we thought it appropriate to use a kind of contemporary sound in the orchestration . But most of the music is still sung in the original key , and all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absolute sincerity , as if we were back in 1880 and this were a brand-new work . What I tell the cast constantly is ' If you just trust the material and do n't comment on it , the effect will he much funnier . ' Sincerity and innocence are the essence of comedy . What we 're also trying to create , through the use of sound technology , is a new kind of theatrical intimacy , which exists only in this theatre at this moment in time . The technology is imperfect , but we do as much as we can to make it invisible yet expressive . Everything I 've ever done in the theatre comes out of regarding problems not as limitations but as ways in which you are forced to come up with solutions that require ingenuity . A problem is not a problem . The problem is how to make it a virtue . " STILL Watqutnyur. : Frank Capra , the gentleman and filmmaker , came to New York the other day , from his home in Southern California , to see a movie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Because Frank Capra directed this film in 1946 , he had already seen it quite a few times . Never before , however , had he seen it during one of Christopher Little 's and David White 's " It 's a Wonderful Life " celebrations . In 1970 , when Little , a photographer , and ' White , a writer , were still college students , they discovered " I.A.W.L. " ( Jimmy Stewart , Donna Reed , Lionel Barrymore , Henry Travers , comic climax ) on the late show . Every year since then , around Christmastime , they have invited over a couple of dozen friends who believe that there is nothing wrong with unbridled sentimentality , and that " I.A.W.L. , " therefore , is a wonderful movie . The must recent party was the tenth-anniversary showing , and , because Little and White had decided that this should be the final " I.A.W.L. " party , they wrote a letter to Frank Capra inviting him to attend . He wrote back , " Nothing would make me happier than to be with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our favorite film . I will be there . " The party took place a couple of nights before Christmas in a loft in Chelsea , where Little lives with his wife , Betsy Kittredge . A large movie screen had been set up in one area of the apartment , and a sixteen-millimetre projector was threaded with the first reel of Capra 's own print of the film . A few inches of leader broke off the reel while it was being threaded , and Little and White seized this for their " I.A.W.L. " memorabilia collection . These archives contain , among other things , two autographed copies of Frank Capra 's autobiography ; two autographed copies of " The Greatest Gift , " the short story , by Philip Van Doren Stern , upon which " I.A.W.L. " was based ; testimonial letters from " I.A.W.L. " aficionados ; and surface-to-air photographs from Ralph Wolfe 's wedding . Ralph Wolfe , an architect who lives in Cambridge , Massachusetts , is a veteran of eight " I.A.W.L. " celebrations . When he and Betty Gilbreath got married , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bayard ( nine " I.A.W.L. " parties each ) arranged for a chartered airplane to fly over the wedding site trailing a banner that said " RALPH AND BETTY : IT 'S A WONDERFUL LIFE . " Frank Capra arrived ahead of most JANUARY 12 , 1981 of the guests , accompanied by his son Tom , a film producer who lives in New York . The elder Capra settled into a chair in the Littles ' living room and immediately relaxed . He wore a white sports coat , a white V-neck sweater , a white turtleneck , and coffee-brown slacks . He is eighty-three years old now and has a thick white mus-tache , thick white eyebrows , and what appears to he a permanent suntan . In person , Frank Capra seems like most of his movies  --  soulful and optimis-tic  --  and he looked as if he were prepared to withstand two hours at the head of a receiving line . Christopher Little explained , however , that an effort had been made to keep the guest list down . " We have to limit this to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've got to be a little ruthless . You need people you can rely on . This afternoon , when we were setting up the projector , it was giving us all sorts of trouble . We need to feel confi-dent that in the worst possible case ? total mechanical failure  --  we have on hand a crowd of spectators who can act out the entire movie line for line . " Soon after nine o'clock , by which time twenty-five guests had arrived , ev-eryone took a seat in the screening area of the loft , and David White made a brief speech . He ran through a capsule biogra-phy of Frank Capra ( born in Palermo , Sicily , in 1897 ; grew up in Los Angeles ; three Oscars , in 1934- , 1936 , and 1938 , for " It Happened One Night , " " Mr. Deeds Goes to Town , " and " You Ca n't Take It with You , " re-spectively ) , and then he said , " Frank Capra is a piece of American culture and therefore a piece of each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when we laugh and why we weep when we weep . Personally , although I have just met him , he 's a man who is very dear to me , because he 's made some wonderful movies . And , on an even more personal note , I 'd like to say that this party is proof that miracles do occur , because I 've wanted to meet Frank Capra for a long time , and tonight THE NEW YOR.K.E.R . I 've said hello and shaken his hand  --  and that 's a miracle . " Frank Capra rose from his chair and said , " I 'm just delighted to be here , just delighted . This is one of the proudest moments of my life . I ca n't tell you how pleased I am that you want to see something that I made . I wo n't say more than that . " The lights were turned out , and Tom Capra started the film projector . There is always quite a bit of crying during an " I.A.W.L. " party ; it 's that sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particularly high emotional key , the sounds of muffled noseblowing  --  originating in the vicinity of Ralph Wolfe  --  began during the first of the film 's four reels . After each reel , the lights went on and Frank Capra graciously conducted an impromptu seminar . People wanted to know " flow did you cast this ? " and " Did you know when you were making it that you had something very special ? " and " Was anyone else considered for the Lionel Barrymore role ? " and " Did Jimmy Stewart and Donna Reed actually fall in love during the filming ? " and " How many takes did you need to get the telephone scene ? " When the last reel ended , by which time the sounds of weeping had become choruslike , there was applause , more sincerely grateful remarks by Frank Capra , and more questions from the floor . Once , to illustrate a point , Frank Capra said , " I must tell you one story about Lionel Barrymore . Have I got time ? " Christopher Little said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ p AR1 ONE : It was noon , it was in the Terrace Room of the Plaza Hotel , there was Chris Evert Lloyd , the world-class women 's tennis champion , there were some executives of an Italian sportswear company who had just flown in from Italy , there were lots of sports reporters from the electronic and print media , there was food ( a buffet of beef hourguignonne , seafood crepes , shrimps , rice , cold strirxgbeans , asparagus in prosciutto , and various French-related desserts ) , there were some tables , round , with white tablecloths , and on these tables there were some half-dead yellow mums . " Chris , " a man said . " Hi , " Chris said . " I am sure these questions will be rather redundant to you , " said a news-woman . " But I am going to ask them anyway . " " Will this five-year-exclusive contract interfere with your career ? " a man asked . " I am not doing much , " Chris answered . " Do you foresee gradual retirement ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day , " Chris answered . " What were the factors involved in this decision for your career ? " a man asked . " How do you feel about Tracy Austin ? " a woman asked . " It 's an Italian company , " said . " I think those Italians know what they are doing . I have a good feel for things . " A large , middle-aged , overweight man who had lost most of the hair on his head but had a nice bushy mustache played with the ends of his mustache as he asked the bartender for a Bloody Mary . Then , turning to his friends , four men who looked more or less like him , he said , " I think Oakland will beat the Giants . " Then he reached into a bowl that was filled with salted nuts and , taking a handful , put them all into his mouth at once .

Chris Evert Lloyd then joined the two men at the lectern . One of them gave her a dozen red roses . " I am really excited about wearing Ellesse clothes , because they are really beautiful , " she said . " I do n't know if you 've seen the line . They 're No. 1 in Europe , and I hope they 'll be No. 1 in the U.S. It 's the best . It deserves to be the best . " ? PART Two : After reading the above , can you tell ( a ) that Chris Evert Lloyd , the world-class women 's tennis champion , has just endorsed a line of sportswear manufactured by an Italian sportswear manufacturer ? ( b ) how Chris Evert Lloyd feels about Tracy Austin ? ( c ) whether most Italians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English at all ? ( d ) if , according to United States government statistics , the large , middle-aged , overweight man will have a health problem soon ? ( e ) if Chris Evert Lloyd can have visions ? ( 1 ) what Chris Evert Lloyd means when she says , " I have a really good feel for things " ? ( g ) if Chris Evert Lloyd trusts only Italian sportswear manufacturers , and not the average Italian walking down a street in Milan ? Would you have liked Chris Evert Lloyd more or less if she had been a geophysicist , a water tower , or an elephant hunted mercilessly for its valuable ivory tusks ? After reading the first paragraph , did you say to yourself , quietly or out loud , " Gee , wish I 'd been there " ?
