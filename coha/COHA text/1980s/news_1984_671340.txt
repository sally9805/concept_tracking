Analysts said the move represented an attempt to end nearly two years of turbulence that began at Continental following the bank ' s tremendous losses from its association with the defunct Penn Square Bank in Oklahoma City . Continental has been suffering from anemic profits and low morale . It has been losing market share to its rivals , and management attention has been diverted by brush fire after corporate brush fire. // The board also promoted Edward S. Bottum , 50 , now executive vice president , to president . He succeeds John Perkins , 62 , who will be leaving in April , the same time as Mr. Anderson. // Continental also declared its regular 50-cent-a-share quarterly dividend , payable May 1 , despite rampant speculation that the payout would be cut. // The management changes were widely expected and few observers were surprised by the naming of the two insiders . " He ' s been the heir apparent for some time , " said Richard Fredericks , a partner with Montgomery Securities in San Francisco . " He proved himself during the worst of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Continental ' s financings after the Penn Square failure in mid-1982 . Many of the bank ' s creditors did not want to roll over its paper when Continental ran into trouble . But bankers say he calmed the financial community and adjusted to the changed financing environment relatively smoothly. // Mr. Taylor has been with Continental for 27 years and became vice chairman this year . He worked his way up through the bond department and was elected treasurer in 1980 . Because of his financial background and the weakness of Continetal ' s earnings prospects , it is expected that one of his first priorities may be to re-examine Continental ' s dividend policy. // <> <> Penn Square Failure a Factor // Continental has been in state of turmoil since July 1982 , when the Penn Square Bank failed , dragging down Continental ' s earnings and reputation in the process . Continental had purchased about $1 billion in energy-related loans from the Oklahoma City bank. // Penn Square was declared insolvent when its losses on loans to oil drillers started mounting in the early days of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its loan- loss reserve to cover the Penn Square debacle. // But the trouble did not stop there . Several executives were forced to resign as a result of the bank ' s energy lending problems . And this produced a severe morale problem among many of the bank ' s employees , who felt that top management had merely found some lower-level scapegoats to shift the blame from itself. // John R. Lytle , a vice president of the oil and gas group , was among the first to go . George R. Baker , executive vice president and once a contender to succeed Mr. Anderson , and a handful of other senior officers resigned a few months later . And last December , Continental announced that Mr. Perkins , the president , and Donald C. Miller , a vice chairman , would retire in April ahead of schedule. // <> <> Messy Public Argument // Ironically , it was a messy public argument with three of the departed executives that galvanized the board into action , local bankers say . A few weeks ago , Mr. Anderson publicly attacked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bergman and James Cordell. // Mr. Anderson said he was " shocked " at allegations that the three while bank officers had invested in energy drilling ventures of Marvin Davis , the Denver oilman who along with Marc Rich , the fugitive commidity trader , owns the 20th Century-Fox Film Corporation . Noting that companies controlled by Mr. Davis were borrowers from Continental , Mr. Anderson said , " Baker , Bergman and Cordell clearly have violated our code of ehtics. " // Mr. Baker , now a limited partner at Bear , Stearns in Chicago , responded by accusing his former boss of " intemperate remarks " and said he exhibited an " inexplicable lack of memory " about the investments . Mr. Baker said the bank ' s outside counsel had known of the investments and that one of his superiors who was still at the bank had made similar investments . At the time , only three officers at the bank ranked higher than Mr. Baker. // The public exchange annoyed many of the bank ' s directors , who felt that Mr. Anderson had overreacted to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the bank , especially since there had been no charges of illegal behavior. // Immediately after the argument , a group of key public directors headed by James F. Bere , chairman of Borg- Warner , began organizing and making calls . Reports of a series of small meetings between groups of directors circulated late last week . The members of the board ' s nominating committee were said to be the most active in pursuing Mr. Anderson ' s removal. // By Friday morning , the dissidents had apparently rounded up enough votes to make the change and today ' s board meeting , lasting only two hours , was said to have been unusually calm , given the agenda. // <> <> Promises Not Kept // Some analysts say the failure of Mr. Anderson to deliver on the promises he made a year ago were as much a factor in his removal as the incident with Mr. Baker . Last year , Mr. Anderson said that he intended in 1983 to reduce Continental ' s problem loans by $500 million and raise profits to $150 million , about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , problem loans still stood at $1. 9 billion . In addition to Penn Square , Continental has made huge loans to some of the most spectacular failures of recent times , including International Harvester , American Invsco , Energy Cooperative , Wickes and AM International. // Earnings also failed to improve as planned , despite far-reaching cost- cutting measures that resulted in the layoff of 800 people last year . At $108. 3 million last year , earnings fell about 28 percent shy of the publicly announced goal. //
