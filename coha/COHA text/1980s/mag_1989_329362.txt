He owned two books detailing how to build a detonating device . He had talked about dying in an explosion . He was the gun captain in Turret 2 of the U.S.S. Iowa on April 19 when a huge explosion in a 16-in. gun killed 47 sailors . On such admittedly circumstantial evidence , the Navy concluded last week that Gunner 's Mate Clayton Hartwig , 24 , who died in the blast , was " most likely " responsible for the tragedy . <P> A board of inquiry ruled out accidental causes , called the explosion a " wrongful , intentional act " and said it had found " foreign material " in the key gun barrel . The admirals theorized that a detonator had been placed between powder bags and that someone had rammed the bags more tightly than normal . Hartwig was , the Navy said , in the best position to direct this . The board did not cite a motive , and one of its members said it had " no hard evidence " to confirm reports that Hartwig may have been a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with another sailor . <P> The investigators , however , did not check out another possibility : that the detonator had been placed inside one of the powder bags before it reached the turret 's gun level . Many sailors had access to the bags while they were stored in the turret 's powder magazine . Hartwig 's angry sister Kathy called the board 's findings " obscene and incredible " and threatened to sue the Navy .
