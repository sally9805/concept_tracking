Saxophonist Art Pepper 's fight back from junkie to jazzman <P> Art Pepper was tense and perspiring , and he had not played a note yet . From the bandstand , he looked out at the opening-night crowd in Fat Tuesday 's , a sleek Manhattan jazz club . " If you only knew the route , " he said to them , " what I had to do , to get here . " <P> They may not have known the grim details of that route : the heavy drinking at 15 , the heroin addiction at 25 , the two broken marriages , the ten years in hospitals , prisons and other institutions , the illness and waste and frequent despair . But they could see some of its ravages in Pepper 's face , which was taut and sallow under his skullcap haircut , almost a death mask . And they could hear some of its pain in the soulful , impassioned solos that Pepper poured out when he picked up his alto sax . <P> At 54 , Art Pepper had come back , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week , following his engagement at Fat Tuesday 's and at clubs in such other cities as Philadelphia and Washington , he wound up a rare swing through the East with a performance for the Atlanta Jazz Alliance . He had a first-rate trio in tow : Pianist Milcho Leviev , Bassist Bob Magnusson and Drummer Carl Burnett . His repertory ranged brilliantly over a variety of moods and rhythms , from standards ( What Is This Thing Called Love ? ) to appealing originals ( Ophelia , Blues for Blanche ) , and from wistful ballads ( Over the Rainbow ) through funky Latin beats ( Mambo Koyama ) to awesome , high-speed pyrotechnics ( Cherokee ) . Amazingly , after all his debilitating periods of obscurity and silence , his full , ringing tone was unimpaired , his melodic gift intact , his instinct for pace and structure still solid . <P> If anything , instead of deteriorating over the years , Pepper 's style has expanded and deepened . He has always something , an original ; but in the late 1940s and early ' 50s , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ West Coast jazzmen first brought him to prominence , his sound combined traces of Lester Young 's cool obliqueness with Charlie Parker 's harmonic and rhythmic complexities . Later he took on a darker , sometimes harsher quality as he came under the influence of John Coltrane 's stabbing , honking outcries and modal sheets of sound . Last week 's performances showed how successfully he has brought all these strains together within a distinctive , fiery lyricism . <P> Pepper 's life has been an ordeal of " searching for something and never stopping , never being satisfied , " as he put it in Straight Life , the unsparing , tape-recorded autobiography ( Schirmer ; 1979 ) that he assembled with his third wife , Laurie . His parents , a hard-bitten merchant seaman and a teen-age bride , began breaking up shortly after Art 's birth in suburban Los Angeles ( which his mother tried to prevent by aborting herself ) . Art 's lonely upbringing was entrusted to an unloving grandmother . He found an outlet in the clarinet at nine and switched to the saxophone at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon jamming around town with musicians like Zoot Sims and Dexter Gordon . At 17 he was married and playing lead alto with Stan Kenton .
