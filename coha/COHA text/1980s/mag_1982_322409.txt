Showdown time for Bendix <P> The matchup is reminiscent of the classic Old West confrontation between a brash young gunslinger and the grizzled veteran with a dozen notches on his gun . William Agee , 44 , the Harvard Business School whiz kid who heads the Bendix Corp. , is facing a showdown with Harry Gray , 62 , the seasoned hustler who began his career selling Dodge trucks for a Chicago dealership and went on to become a renowned conglomerate builder as chairman of United Technologies Corp . In the newest twist in a complex takeover struggle , United Technologies announced last week that it was joining forces with Martin Marietta Corp . in an unprecedented double-team effort to acquire Bendix and divide its assets between them . <P> Bendix , a diversified manufacturer of auto and aerospace parts , machine tools and other industrial products , started the Shootout three weeks ago by making an offer of about $1.5 billion to buy Martin Marietta , an aerospace firm that also makes chemicals and building materials . Martin Marietta not only rejected the offer , but quickly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ billion . At about the same time , Martin Marietta began secret negotiations with United Technologies , which had been rumored to be interested in acquiring Bendix . <P> The talks culminated in a marathon meeting between Harry Gray and Thomas Pownall , president of Martin Marietta , on the afternoon and evening of Sept. 2 at the offices of United 's New York City lawyers . With a handshake shortly before midnight , the two executives agreed that both their companies would offer to buy Bendix for approximately $1.5 billion . If a majority of Bendix shareholders sold out to either of them , the winner would assume control of Bendix , and then the two firms would carve up the captured company . The details have not been worked out , but United would probably take Bendix 's automotive and machine-tool businesses , while Martin Marietta would get several lines of aerospace products . <P> Agee was caught off guard . Says a top executive of a company that buys Bendix products : " I think that Agee is in over his head . When he makes a move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might do . " Bendix 's immediate response was to raise its offer for Martin Marietta to about $1.6 billion . Agee also tried to get in touch with Martin Marietta officials to propose calling off the whole game with a " mutally agreed withdrawal . " Martin Marietta was not interested . <P> When Gray became United 's chief executive in 1972 , the company was known chiefly for its Pratt &; Whitney jet engines . Since then , he has expanded by buying several firms , including Otis Elevator in 1976 and Carrier , the air-conditioner manufacturer , in 1979 . Over the years , Gray 's opponents have reportedly called the slow-speaking but fast-moving Georgian a robber baron , a buzzard , Dracula , Jack the Ripper and King Kong . Few of his takeover thrusts have been thwarted , however .
