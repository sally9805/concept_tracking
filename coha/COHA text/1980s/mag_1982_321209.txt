Gemayel takes charge amid hopes that foreign forces will leave <P> To the war-weary residents of West Beirut , the operation had all the marks of another invasion . Just before dawn Tuesday morning , armored cars and personnel carriers rumbled toward dozens of intersections in the downtown area . They sealed off three neighborhoods , including the heart of the commercial and banking area , barring all persons except doctors , journalists and food-store operators . Soldiers went from house to house , checking identity papers and searching for weapons and ammunition . By week 's end the army said it had arrested an estimated 500 people , mostly for being in Lebanon illegally , and uncovered more than 300 tons of ammunition . <P> <P> This time , however , the troops fanning out in the city represented none of the forces that have tried to impose their order on West Beirut in the past six years . They were not Israeli , Syrian or Palestinian . Instead , they were from the 22,000-strong Lebanese army , which since the 1975-76 civil war has rarely dared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the most visible indication yet that the government of newly elected President Amin Gemayel is intent upon asserting its authority over the capital . <P> As the mopping-up operation went on , the U.S. , France and Italy , which sent the 3,960-man peace-keeping force to Lebanon , warned the Gemayel government not to violate anyone 's civil rights . But there were few complaints from the civilians . Said a senior Western diplomat who monitored the crackdown : " On the whole , it was a humane and disciplined operation . " Saeb Salam , a former Prime Minister and a respected spokesman for Lebanon 's Muslim community , welcomed the Lebanese army 's assertion of control . Said he : " We have been through such a dreadful experience in the last few years that people want someone to take charge . " <P> The roundup began only one day after Gemayel had reappointed Chafik al Wazzan , 57 , a soft-spoken Muslim lawyer , as Prime Minister . In accordance with an unwritten 1943 accord , the President is always a Maronite Christian and the Prime Minister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appointment was a reassuring sign to Lebanon 's Muslims , including the Palestinians , who are wary of Christian rule . During the siege of Beirut , Wazzan earned the admiration of his fellow Muslims for his defiance of the Israelis . <P> Paradoxically , another encouraging sign developed last week out of an act of violence . Unidentified gunmen ambushed an Israeli bus only six miles southeast of Beirut on the main highway to Damascus , killing six Israeli soldiers and wounding 22 . The next morning , in apparent retaliation , Israeli jets destroyed a Syrian S A-9 truck-mounted missile battery at Dar al Baideh , 20 miles east of Beirut .
