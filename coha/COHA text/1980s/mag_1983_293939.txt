MY LAST SIGH by Luis Buuel Translated by Abigail Israel Knopf ; 256 pages ; $15.95 <P> He began his first film , Un Chien Andalou ( 1928 ) , by walking onto a moon-flooded balcony and calmly slitting a young woman 's eye . He began his last film , That Obscure Object of Desire ( 1977 ) , by replacing his leading lady with two actresses who alternated scenes in the same role .

For the surrealists , the price of victory was high : acceptance by the hated bourgeoisie . Buuel must have sighed in agreement when his friend Andre Breton noted that , alas , no one could be scandalized any more . <P> Buuel 's autobiography ( written in collaboration with his longtime screenwriter , Jean-Claude Carrire ) is thus in part the testament of an old man passing ironic judgment on a century that finally learned to accommodate him . If the book offers any shocks , they are of the boomerang variety : the iconoclast at twilight is in danger of becoming a moralist . He condemns " the proliferation of gutter words " in modern literature ; he criticizes the excesses of his anarchist comrades in the Spanish Civil War ; he expresses relief in the waning of his sexual desire ( " It 's as if I 've finally been relieved of a tyrannical burden " ) . It would seem that the only way the old surrealist can shock today 's audience is by exposing himself as a discreetly charming gentleman . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Calanda , where " the Middle Ages lasted until World War I.

In the early days , just about everyone he met was famous . Even before he made his first film at 28 , Buuel tells us , he had vanquished Heavyweight Champ Jack John son at arm wrestling ; he had met Jorge Luis Borges , and found him tedious ; Picasso had given him a painting ( which he lost ) , and Lorca had written poems to him ( which he quotes ) . Later , in Holly wood , Charlie Chaplin thoughtfully ar ranged an orgy for Buuel , and in New York , the power of the Roman Catholic Church was flexed to remove him from an editing job at the Museum of Modern Art ( where one of his tasks had been to cut Leni Riefenstahl 's Nazified master piece .
