Hot debate in Canada <P> While the U.S. Roman Catholic bishops are refining their critique of the Reagan Administration 's nuclear arms strategy , their colleagues in Canada have stirred up a nationwide controversy on economics . Businessmen are howling , labor leaders cheering and politicians buzzing over a statement issued last week by the bishops ' commission for social affairs charging that the economic slump is producing " a deepening moral crisis . " Canada 's government should reverse field , the paper says , targeting unemployment rather than inflation as the major economic problem to be solved . <P> The seven-page document is officially the product of only the eight bishops on the commission , but it was approved by the hierarchy 's four-member executive committee , and has been getting widespread back ing from other bishops , though Emmett Cardinal Carter , the Archbishop of Toronto , says it is " risky " for the church to get into specifics on economics . <P> Bishop Remi De Roo of Victoria , B.C. , the commission chairman , has been happily astonished by the strong reaction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same with little effect since the 1970s . " Events have shaken the complacency of people , " he said . Canada 's current unemployment rate is 12.8% . <P> The bishops ' paper is a direct attack on the proinvestment policies of Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau , a Catholic . Trudeau has argued that Canada must stress profits , wage restraints , investment and productivity . Challenging those priorities , the commission condemns " the renewed emphasis on the ' survival of the fittest ' as the supreme law of economics " and asks for controls on profits , soak-the-rich taxation , a bigger role for labor unions and government programs to create jobs . <P> " We want people who presently are powerless in society to become participants rather than statistics who are told what to expect from the mandarins and the corporate executives , " said De Roo . Trudeau , traveling in Thailand last week , was unimpressed by the bishops ' statement : " I do n't think their economics are very good . " <P> The debate in Canada may be echoed south @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nuclear arms decree this spring , they plan to carry on with a pastoral letter about economic problems ; it is likely to contain an implicit attack on Reaganomics.
