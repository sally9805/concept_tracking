Given a choice between two product lines , one thriving and the other struggling , most companies would have no problem deciding which one to embrace . But for Zenith , the decision was painful . The suburban-Chicago company surprised the high-tech industry last week by agreeing to sell its prosperous computer division to France 's Groupe Bull for about $635 million .

Says Chairman Jerry Pearlman : " We are a highly leveraged company in two very tough businesses . We really felt we could n't do either of them appropriate justice . " Pearlman had tried to sell the company 's TV division , but no buyers were willing to pay the reported $400 million asking price . <P> Zenith had expanded into computers to reduce its reliance on TVs , a business that low-cost foreign producers were beginning to dominate . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expanded the division to include a line of laptop computers . Zenith 's machines are now among the world 's best sellers , bringing in about 60% of the company 's revenues of $2.7 billion . With this deal , Bull will become the largest European-based computer maker . <P> The sale will virtually wipe out Zenith 's debt and enable the company to invest in new technologies , including high-definition television .
