This proposal , put forward by Colin Pennycuick , an ornithologist from the University of Miami , is the latest wrinkle in the ongoing scientific debate over how and why the ancestors of modern birds earned their wings. // Through the millenia , a number of different species - everything from frogs to squirrels - have taken to the air in various fashions . But birds are the only ones that have done so from two , rather than four legs . This has meant that birds have been able to keep their feet - and the ability to move on the ground - at the same time that they developed the ability to soar among the clouds . This is one reason that birds have proved so successful . But it has also made it difficult to determine just how thebirds ' ancestor made such a transition , an effort seriously hampered by the dearth of fossil records of early avians. // As a result , the scholarly debate on the evolution of flight has centered on birds . It dates back more than a century and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arboreal theory , holds that birds evolved from tree-dwelling dinosaurs that learned to fly by falling out of trees . Challenging this is the ' ' ground up , ' ' or cursorial theory that maintains that small , running dinosaurs developed wings and flight to control themselves while leaping off the ground to snag prey or escape from predators . Last Tuesday , this debate was updated and recapitulated at a symposium held at the California Academy of Sciences. // The ' ' ground up ' ' theory was in total eclipse until a decade ago , when John Ostrom of Yale University revived it . His argument is based primarily on the nature of the fossils of the earliest known bird , Archaeopteryx lithographica . A half-dozen marvelously preserved fossils of this 135 million-plus-year-old creature have been recovered from central Bavaria . These show not only the skeleton but also the imprint of feathers from a bird about the size of a magpie , with a long , feathered tail , sinuous neck , and a lizard-like jaw. // ' ' Archaeopteryx has feet which look much more like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr. Ostrom contends . The ancient bird ' s skeleton also suggests that it could not fly very well . In particular , the fossils show that it has three independent fingers on its wings . In modern birds these fingers have fused into a single bone. // Taken together , these features suggest that this bird may have been more like a road runner with a limited ability to glide rather than an arboreal bird , the scientist suggests. // It is generally agreed that feathers first evolved from scales as insulation when the bird ' s ancestors changed from cold-blooded to warm-blooded animals . Once feathered , these running dinosaurs found that they used feathered forelimbs to leap higher and longer until they gradually developed the ability to soar from cliffs , Ostrom suggests. // Last year three scientists from the University of Northern Arizona , led by ornithologist Russell Balda , took up this cause . They published a paper on the basic aerodynamics of leaping , feathered lizards which defends the possibility that flight could have developed in such a fashion . ' ' We ' re @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the trees down , and it looks more difficult , ' ' says group member Gerald Caple. // Walter Bock , a biologist from Columbia University , has assumed the mantle of defender of the arboreal theory . His defense relies primarily on the basic principles of evolution . Evolution , he explains , must proceed by a number of small , strictly chronological steps . For each adaptation , there must be a strong evolutionary rationale. // Dr. Bock sees the origin of flight proceeding along the following lines . First , there were ground-dwelling dinosaurs that adopted an upright , bipedal posture . These took to the trees , possibly for protection from predators . Because temperatures in the forest canopies are lower than those on the ground , they were forced to become warm-blooded and their scales evolved into insulating down . Leaping among the trees led to the development of rudimentary wings to act as parachutes in case these feathered saurians fell . Next , as their wings strengthened , they began to glide . Finally , soaring evolved into active flight. // Archaeopteryx , Bock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spent some of its time on the ground and some of its time in trees , climbing up the side using the claws on its wings as well as its hind feet. // Learning to fly from the trees down has a number of advantages , the scientist explains . Life in the trees would enable the bird ' s ancestors to develop the three-dimensional perception needed for flight . And working with gravity is much easier than working against it. // The main flaw in the ' ' ground up ' ' hypothesis , he contends , is its failure to explain the development of warm-bloodedness. // Dr. Pennycuick also favors the arboreal theory. // Looking at Archaeopteryx through the eyes of his studies with birds and bats , Pennycuick injected some fresh ideas into what has become an increasingly ritualized debate. // The long fingers on these ancient birds may not be for grasping as had been generally accepted , he proposed . Instead , they may have been joined by a membrane wing similar to that of a bat . At first , the feathers may have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bone as is the case in modern birds . This idea is supported by the fact that in one of the fossils the feather imprints are separated from the bones but still remain precisely in order. // Putting membranes on Archaeopteryx ' s forelimbs would create a very nice set of gliding wings , the scientist says . They would be more efficient than those on today ' s flying squirrels . The only problem is that they would fly very fast , so perhaps feathers elongated as much to slow the primitive birds down as to aid in their flying. // The scientists involved in this longstanding debate agree that there is not enough information to resolve their differences . However , Dr. Ostrom appears to have achieved his main objective : ' ' At least , the arboreal theory is no longer accepted without question. ' ' // //
