Therefore , it 's a pretty good bet they are reliable businessmen and not fly-by-nights . You can also check businesses out with the Metropolitan Better Business Bureaus , and you can call trade associations for recommendations . Another thing to be careful of are bargains ; the proverb " you get what you pay for " generally applies . The same principle applies in the selection of furniture , medical and dental services and almost anything else you purchase . Your car represents a large investment to you , and good maintenance is critical . You have the right to shop , ask for estimates in advance , and above all , pay only for the work you authorize . If a legitimate garage operator finds that additional work is necessary , he is required to call you or ask you for permission to proceed . If he does work without your authorization or permission , you are under no obligation to pay for unnecessary or unauthorized work . Generally speaking , those shops belonging to trade associations are the more image-conscious businessmen in the community .
