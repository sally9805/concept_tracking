The 300-mile ribbon of Mexican Pacific coastline that stretches from Manzanillo to Acapulco has long been considered one of the world 's beautiful places , home to a sprinkling of fishing hamlets and resorts . Yet beneath the indigo waves and silky white beaches lies a jagged fault line that could be one of the deadliest in the Western Hemisphere . It was this fault that erupted under the Pacific last week , causing the earthquake that measured 7.8 on the Richter scale , * rocked coastal towns and brought disaster to Mexico City . <P> To scientists , the great quake and its aftershocks were not surprising . Karen McNally , a geophysicist at the University of California , Santa Cruz , had warned in 1981 that substantial seismic activity was likely in the area . " Everything we had seen , " she says , " could not allow us to exclude the possibility of a major earthquake . " <P> In a seeming paradox , the location of last week 's quake was thought to be endangered because it had been calm for so long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about 150 miles up the coast from Acapulco , lay within a kind of geological DMZ known as a seismic gap : a region that had not experienced a major earthquake for many years , but where bottled-up stress caused by tectonic-plate activity had reached the bursting point . <P> Solid though it appears , the earth 's crust is composed of a dozen large plates and several smaller ones , ranging in thickness from 20 to 150 miles . The plates are in constant motion , riding on the molten mantle below and normally traveling at the pace of a millimeter a week , equivalent to the growth rate of a fingernail . Geophysicist Bill Spence of the U.S. Geological Survey in Colorado says , " They 're just like a mobile jigsaw puzzle . " The plates ' travels result in continental drift , the formation of mountains , volcanoes  --  and earthquakes . <P> If plates carrying two continental masses collide , for example , the crust buckles , creating craggy mountain ranges like the Himalayas . If they grind past each other , as the Pacific and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , friction locks them together . Every so often , abrupt slippages occur and the earth around them shudders in what geologists call strike-slip quakes . Still another kind of tectonic phenomenon , the meeting of an oceanic and a continental plate , is responsible for the Mexican disaster . <P> With irresistible force , the Cocos plate , which forms part of the Pacific floor off Mexico , is pushing northeastward at a rate of 2 to 4 1/2 in. a year against the North American plate , which is creeping westward . As the Cocos plate dips <P> under the continental crust , the oceanic mass sticks in certain places , its motion halted by friction . But the force propelling Cocos forward remains unrelenting , building up strain in the rock of both plates . When the frictional forces are overcome , the " stuck " section of the Cocos plate lurches forward ( at least 10 ft. last week ) , generating the shock waves of a " thrust " quake .                @ @ @ @ @
