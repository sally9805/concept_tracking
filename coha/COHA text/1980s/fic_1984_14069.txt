As the HOUSE LIGHTS dim to darkness , we hear the sounds of a SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA tuning , warming up . Trills , runs , blasts , arpeggios , cadenzas . A VOICE . Hold it ! Hold it ! ( SOUND subsides a few decibels . A BATON hits the metal stand on the podium , noisily . ) Quiet , please ! Quiet ! ! ( The SOUND subsides , but not much . A BELL rings , to no effect . ) Sorry , Maestro . Best I can do . The Powerful Voice Of Vito De Angelis Ladies ! Gentlemen ! SHADDOP ! ! ( Instant silence . ) FIRST VOICE . Thank you , Maestro Roll tape Take one . Figaro Overture . Houston Symphony . Conductor : Vito De Angelis . ( All at once , the surrounding air is filled with the vibrant SOUND of a stirring performance of Mozart 's Overture to The Marriage of Figaro . The stage is dark , except for a SPOTLIGHT on the CONDUCTOR leading the orchestra with enormous energy and style . We see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . APPLAUSE . The SPOTLIGHT fades . LIGHTS come up on the study in the home of the conductor , Vito De Angelis . Turtle Bay Gardens , New York City . A bright afternoon in April . Throughout the play , the vital and varied New York City STREET SOUNDS will be heard . You have doubtless heard of Maestro De Angelis . Even those indifferent to music know his name . He has seen to that . For in addition to being a superlative musician , his gifts extend to that greatest of all Twentieth Century Arts : Public Relations . He never tells his age . He seems older to some , younger to others . Older to his wife of some 30 years , younger to his female adorers who find his undulating back , as he conducts , irresistibly sensuous . The beautifully appointed study is a mosaic of certificates , plaques , signed photographs of musical greats , decorations , ribbons , medals , statuettes , gold records , honorary degrees , and assorted awards . A Steinway grand piano . A $40,000 stereo installation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of records and cassettes and compact discs . A plethora of mirrors , in which the Maestro studies and considers himself from time to often time . The study is on the third floor of the five-story brownstone . Through the wide windows in the back wall can be seen the top of a tall elm tree . VITO DE ANGELIS , The Maestro , is pacing about , slowly , while his literary ASSISTANT reads from a typescript on a portable Kluge desk on his lap . THE MAESTRO listens as he works on a lollipop . The assistant is ROBERT EPSTEIN , about 35 , handsome , able , intelligent , humorous . ) ROBERT EPSTEIN ( Reading. ) "  --  and when an Argentinian interviewer asked , When did you begin to conduct ? I have replied , I have always conducted . So long as I can remember. My father , who was concertmaster at La Scala in Milano for forty-four years , told me that at the age of three , I would stand in front of the phonograph  --  or the gramophone , as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( THE MAESTRO , remembering , conducts in the manner of a small boy , smiling at himself in the nearest mirror. ) p. 3 ROBERT EPSTEIN My musical education , so , began at birth . In time , I became a fine pianist , an excellent cellist , and a superb clarinetist  --  but my big heart was always in conducting . Unfortunately , I was possessed of too much talent  --  ( THE MAESTRO nods , gravely . ) ROBERT EPSTEIN  --  and therefore , dangerous facility . Critics and rival conductors often sometime accused me of superficial preparation . At times , this may have been true , for I was always interested in life as well as in music . I wanted all that the good life has to offer  --  which is a very great deal . " ( HE stops. )  --  A great deal ? A very great deal ? No . A great deal . ( HE makes the correction . ) ( THE MAESTRO , attempting to study his profile in a combination of two mirrors , remains oblivious to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as I have often said  --  Art should be what is left over from life.

Rachel , she provided the inspiration which has led to aspiration . Up to that time , I sometimes traded on my flair , my platform charm , and my technical mastery .

HE puffs his hair above his ears , squints , gets out a pair of eyeglasses and puts them on , the better to admire himself . ) ROBERT EPSTEIN ( Continuing . ) " Musical because romantic , romantic because beautiful . It was a time when much light work was played for balance . I had agreed to conduct a New Year 's Eve performance of Johann Strauss 's glorious Die Fledermaus .

VITO DE ANGELIS ( At his peak . ) Is too late to apologize ! Out ! ( ROBERT and RACHEL look at each other . No use . THEY can not help bursting into laughter . VITO , confused , is breathing hard . The LIGHTS dim swiftly . In the darkness we hear the great recording of Die Fledermaus . Rachel Garland is singing  --  in English  --  Adele 's celebrated laughing song. ) p. 19 p. 20 Act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LIGHTS come up . The MUSIC fades . We are in the living room . It is an enchanting place , clearly untouched by professional interior decoration . Instead , it reflects the combined personalities of Rachel and The Maestro . A comfortable , utilitarian , warm , lived-in space . In the background , as always in this house , MUSIC is playing , softly . At the moment , it is a recording of Kinderscenen by Schumann . A large , superb Grandma Moses , which hangs over the fireplace , seems to have been painted there by the artist . A Reginald Marsh burlesque nude . A Horace Pippin . These are Rachel 's pictures . The Maestro 's are : a grand Canaletto , an exquisite Raphael ( yes ! ) , a Caravaggio , and the famous Picasso portrait of The Maestro on the podium , lighted dramatically . The furniture , too , combines New England and Italian modern . Plants and fresh flowers abound  --  the latter stunningly arranged by Rachel . The living room is on the second floor . Through the window @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trunk . Upstage , the large double doors set in the archway lead to the hall and the curved staircase . From time to time , when the doors are open , we see BRUCE or ERIC or both going about their household duties . In this scene , their jackets are maroon . A month has passed . It is now May . Early evening . RACHEL and a YOUNG WOMAN , both standing , are in the midst of a tense , acrimonious argument . The young woman is IRIS PEABODY , a senior editor representing the staid and illustrious Boston publishing firm of Little , Brown and Company . She is shapely and leggy . Her hair is piled high on her splendid head , revealing an exceptional neck . She is handsome rather than pretty and projects a magnetic vitality . She wears eyeglasses which accentuate her beauty . RACHEL and IRIS have reached that point in debate where both adversaries are talking at the same time . IRIS PEABODY  --  simply will not postpone for a third time ! It 's making us look ridiculous in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more  --  p. 21 RACHEL GARLAND DE ANGELIS Why not ? What is so impossible about a postponement ? ( THEY stop together , momentarily exhausted . ) IRIS PEABODY I did not say , Mrs. De Angelis , that a postponement was impossible . I said that Little , Brown is not prepared to postpone for a third time . RACHEL GARLAND DE ANGELIS But what 's the alternative ? IRIS PEABODY Call it off . RACHEL GARLAND DE ANGELIS ( Astounded . ) Call it off ? IRIS PEABODY Take it elsewhere . You may find a publisher with more patience , although I doubt it . RACHEL GARLAND DE ANGELIS Do you mean to tell me that your company is willing to give up this remarkable piece of  --  IRIS PEABODY It is n't a remarkable anything , Mrs. De Angelis . Not yet . RACHEL GARLAND DE ANGELIS It 's half done . IRIS PEABODY We ca n't sell half a book . RACHEL GARLAND DE ANGELIS But you  --  IRIS PEABODY Could he sell half a recording ? p. 22 RACHEL GARLAND DE ANGELIS Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suppose that was . But here 's something that 's not . ( SHE takes a folder out of her Gucci envelope and extracts a single sheet . SHE goes on talking , but RACHEL never takes her eyes off that sheet . ) IRIS PEABODY Our comptroller sent this up to the Board last week . Then the publisher sent for me . All my fault , of course . I should have seen to it that  --  . Why did n't I  --  ? The fact that I have n't been personally involved  --  that Mr. De Angelis 's editor kept assuring me that  --  RACHEL GARLAND DE ANGELIS What does it say ? IRIS PEABODY  --  what say ? RACHEL GARLAND DE ANGELIS That . IRIS PEABODY ( Looking at it . ) The comptroller estimates that thus far , the De Angelis deal has cost us more than sixty-six thousand dollars in non-recoverable monies , over and above the advance . RACHEL GARLAND DE ANGELIS I do n't understand how it  --  IRIS PEABODY The contract for this book was signed four years ago  --  RACHEL GARLAND @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PEABODY ( Consults the sheet . ) Four years , less six weeks . At that time , the due date was fixed at one year from signing . RACHEL GARLAND DE ANGELIS But that turned out to be an exceptionally busy year for him : La Scala to Covent Garden to San Francisco to Chicago to  --  IRIS PEABODY Spare me . I 'm getting jet lag . RACHEL GARLAND DE ANGELIS Busy , do n't you see ? IRIS PEABODY ( Consults the paper again . ) At any rate , the comptroller tells us that the expenses and interest on this amount  --  comes to sixty-six thousand , seven-hundred-eight dollars and sixty-four cents . RACHEL GARLAND DE ANGELIS But what do you want us to do ? IRIS PEABODY It 's not a question of what I want to do . I 'm not an " I. " I 'm only a messenger . I hate this chore . Because I find I like you . RACHEL GARLAND DE ANGELIS Thank you . IRIS PEABODY And as for Mr. De Angelis  --  RACHEL GARLAND DE ANGELIS ( Automatically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Maestro  --  I 've been a besotted fan for years . And even though I 've never met him  --  I did n't want to , really . It would be like meeting Chopin or Dickens or DaVinci  --  I 've admired him more than I can say . p. 24 RACHEL GARLAND DE ANGELIS Does that mean you do n't admire him now ? IRIS PEABODY ( A pause . ) Our present position is this . We wish to cancel our contract for the book tentatively titled MAESTRO by Vito De Angelis , and The Maestro is to return to us immediately the sum of one hundred and eighty-three thousand seven hundred and eight dollars and sixty-four cents . ( During the above , RACHEL gets up and goes to the door . But instead of of leaving , SHE closes it and returns to the scene . ) RACHEL GARLAND DE ANGELIS Miss Peabody , in the circumstances , it is now necessary to tell you something . IRIS PEABODY Yes ? RACHEL GARLAND DE ANGELIS The Maestro does have seven hundred and eight dollars . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . RACHEL GARLAND DE ANGELIS What he does not have is the hundred-and-eighty-three thousand . IRIS PEABODY ( Looking around . ) None of my business , but I 'd say these pictures are worth what used to be called " a pretty penny . " RACHEL GARLAND DE ANGELIS The American ones are mine . p. 25 IRIS PEABODY Oh . RACHEL GARLAND DE ANGELIS And the Italian ones have been loaned to him by various friends and admirers : Norton Simon , William Paley , Mary Lasker . IRIS PEABODY I see . ( IRIS is looking around again . ) RACHEL GARLAND DE ANGELIS The house ? Mine . And everything in it , except , of course his things : the piano , scores , stereo , clothing . He does have terribly expensive clothing  --  but I do n't think one hundred , eight-three thousand dollars worth . IRIS PEABODY Mrs. De Angelis , what do you expect us to do ? Have you any suggestions ? RACHEL GARLAND DE ANGELIS Wait . You 'll get your book . We must find a writer . IRIS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that ?  --  five in four years !

IRIS PEABODY ( Gulps . ) Do n't tell me Anne McKay made a pass at him . She 's the most straight-laced young  --  RACHEL GARLAND DE ANGELIS With her , it was the other way about . IRIS PEABODY Oh , dear . RACHEL GARLAND DE ANGELIS And her husband objected . IRIS PEABODY And then  --  Robert Epstein . RACHEL GARLAND DE ANGELIS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best writers I know . Not really a ghost . I was astonished when he accepted the assignment . RACHEL GARLAND DE ANGELIS He loved The Maestro , that 's why . IRIS PEABODY And the chapters he turned in are  --  well , superlative . RACHEL GARLAND DE ANGELIS But they quarreled . Made up , quarreled again . On and off and finally  --  off , for good . p. 27 IRIS PEABODY Do you think there 's a chance they might  --  ? RACHEL GARLAND DE ANGELIS No , no . Out of the question . IRIS PEABODY Well , then . There we are . RACHEL GARLAND DE ANGELIS There must be someone ! IRIS PEABODY Shall we get in touch with your lawyer ? Or with his agent ? Is it still Irving Paul Lazar ?

I could n't . Even if I could , I would n't . RACHEL GARLAND DE ANGELIS But why not ? IRIS PEABODY Terrified . RACHEL GARLAND DE ANGELIS Sit down . IRIS PEABODY No . RACHEL GARLAND DE ANGELIS For a moment . ( As RACHEL goes to the intercom , IRIS moves to the farthest corner of the room as if to hide . ) VITO 'S VOICE Si .

Suddenly , HE gives the downbeat , singing the opening bar of Beethoven 's Fifth Symphony . The LIGHTS dim swiftly . As the scene darkens . The Cleveland Symphony Orchestra takes up the MUSIC and plays the next twelve bars , fading as the LIGHTS come up on Scene 3. ) p. 43 Act 1 , Scene 3 ACT I : Scene 3 The LIGHTS come up to reveal that we are in one of the most attractive and charming rooms in the house , the dining room , situated on the ground floor and overlooking a lush , verdant backyard . Rachel 's flower garden is varied and abundant . She cares for it herself daily , in the appropriate seasons . The lower part of the elm can now be seen . From upstairs , the BEETHOVEN continues softly . The dining room furniture was designed and built and given to The Maestro by his old friend and admirer , Frank Lloyd Wright . It combines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ armchair . The table is octagonal . When there are eight at the table , each one has a different service of matching napery , silver , and china . The cabinets and shelving suggest forever . The paintings have been acquired across the years , not from celebrated artists or grand galleries but from student shows and flea markets and street sales . They all celebrate the glory of food and wine : a colorful French charcuterie ; a glistening lobster ; a tray of cheese , each with a tiny flag designating the country of its origin ; a loaf of bread ; three wine bottles : a red , a white , a ros ; a flowing cornucopia of fruit ; a cornfield . No one has ever entered this room without his appetite being stimulated . A decorative Japanese screen shields the swinging door to the pantry and kitchen beyond . It is 1:10 P.M. of a sweet , sunny August day . VITO and RACHEL are at the table . THEY are having jellied madrilne with red caviar and a sour cream topping . There is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blue jackets , are serving . Eric , biscuits ; Bruce , wine . VITO , a gourmet/gourmand , is tasting and considering judiciously . RACHEL watches him . HE is about to say something . ERIC and BRUCE , too , wait for the reaction , but nothing comes . Instead , VITO takes another spoonful and tastes it as though sampling vintage wine . VITO DE ANGELIS ( Finally . ) Good . p. 44 RACHEL GARLAND DE ANGELIS Thank you . ( SHE , BRUCE , and ERIC are relieved . ) VITO DE ANGELIS But not so good as last time . ( RACHEL laughs musically and merrily . SHE exchanges a look with the SERVANTS who leave . VITO frowns . ) VITO DE ANGELIS Is funny ? ROBERT EPSTEIN Hilarious . VITO DE ANGELIS Why ? RACHEL GARLAND DE ANGELIS Because we 've had this lovely jellied madrilne with red caviar and sour cream once a week in the summer months  --  ever since Nela Rubinstein gave you the recipe . VITO DE ANGELIS So ? RACHEL GARLAND DE ANGELIS And every time we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ANGELIS Say what ? RACHEL GARLAND DE ANGELIS ( Imitating him remarkably . ) " Good . But not so good as a last time ! " VITO DE ANGELIS You should try get rid your Italian accent . ( THEY share a little laugh . ) VITO DE ANGELIS You know who had the Italian accent more bad as me ? Toscanini . Because he has hated the English language . Me , I love it . I don ' speak it but I love it . p. 45 RACHEL GARLAND DE ANGELIS ( Reaches over and touches his hand affectionately . ) You speak it very well  --  VITO DE ANGELIS ( Over-enunciating , especially the th sound . ) Thank  --  you  --  ay  --  thousand  --  thimes .

VITO gets up. ) p. 46 IRIS PEABODY Oh , please do n't get up . VITO DE ANGELIS I am up . ( HE holds her chair for her . As THEY stand next to each other , we note that they are now the same height . Of course . SHE is now wearing the flattest possible sandals  --  and no eyeglasses . She has acquired contact lenses . ) IRIS PEABODY Thank you , Maestro . ( HE seats her and returns to his chair as ERIC comes in and serves Iris . BRUCE follows with wine . ) IRIS PEABODY Thank you . ( ERIC goes . ) IRIS PEABODY I 'm terribly sorry to be late . VITO DE ANGELIS Me . I am never late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ VITO DE ANGELIS Only with delivering manuscripts . ( ALL THREE laugh tentatively . ) IRIS PEABODY Not my fault really , it 's just  --  gosh , this is delicious ! RACHEL GARLAND DE ANGELIS You should have been here last time ! ( VITO laughs . BRUCE leaves . ) IRIS PEABODY It was a San Francisco call . That beau of mine ! He 's brainy as can be , but he never has been able to understand the time difference . He ca n't remember if it 's three hours earlier here or later or four hours or what . p. 47 VITO DE ANGELIS Is three hours sooner there except daylight time . Then four hours .

( VITO reacts physically , and so violently that the tray and the lobster salad go all over the table , to say nothing of all over him . Swift , complex action : RACHEL rings the bell . ERIC comes running in and assists . BRUCE puts down the serving platter and does what he can do with the table . RACHEL works on Vito . ERIC does the floor . A new placement and napkin are provided . It is all done at high speed and in a way that makes us suspect that it has happened before . All clear . ERIC and BRUCE leave. ) p. 49 VITO DE ANGELIS ( Quietly and calmly . ) Zubin Mehta ?

Had to . Mozart , too . RACHEL GARLAND DE ANGELIS Well , as I always say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . VITO DE ANGELIS You know why we got The Goldberg Variations ?

VITO DE ANGELIS ( A pause . ) Why she so nervous , this nervous girl ? RACHEL GARLAND DE ANGELIS I think you make her nervous . VITO DE ANGELIS I think you make her . RACHEL GARLAND DE ANGELIS How ?

( The LIGHTS fade. ) @x We are back in the study where we began . Almost two months have passed , and the new season is reflected in a change of flowers . The bright vivid summer spectrum has been replaced by gentle autumnal hues . It is a late afternoon in October and we are aware of the fact that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Forty-seventh Street and Second Avenue , the spirited sound of Trinidadian STEEL PANS are heard . RACHEL , wearing a colorful Chanel tweed suit , is dictating to ROBERT . SHE moves about the room  --  sitting , standing , sprawling , as she digs into herself for the right word , or idea or expression , or memory . Robert 's jacket hangs on the back of his chair ; he wears a vest and his tie is loosened . RACHEL GARLAND DE ANGELIS  --  but with Vito and me  --  it was a case of " loathe at first sight . " ( ROBERT laughs lightly . ) RACHEL GARLAND DE ANGELIS You do n't think that 's just a bit tacky , that joke ? ROBERT EPSTEIN Not at all . So . ( HE reads ) "  --  but with Vito and me it was a case of loathe at first sight . " RACHEL GARLAND DE ANGELIS ( Dictating again . ) At that time , my Italian was sketchy and his English was non-existent . So communication was  --  ( SHE stops talking and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ceiling for a moment . Finishing her sentence. )  --  perplexing . p. 70 ROBERT EPSTEIN Good . RACHEL GARLAND DE ANGELIS ( Goes to the bar tray and pours herself a glass of Mountain Valley water . ) Have you ever noticed  --  ( SHE holds up the bottle . ) Want some ? ROBERT EPSTEIN No , thanks . RACHEL GARLAND DE ANGELIS  --  how often the word you 're looking for is on the ceiling ? ROBERT EPSTEIN ( Smiles . Reading from his notes . ) " So communication was perplexing . " RACHEL GARLAND DE ANGELIS ( Thinks for a beat before continuing . ) It must be noted that although the war had been over for some time , the embers of enmity were still smoldering fiercely beneath the polite surface . ROBERT EPSTEIN Beautiful ! RACHEL GARLAND DE ANGELIS Are you flattering me for some reason , Bobby ? Or just because you 're a dear fellow ? ROBERT EPSTEIN I 'm flattering you not at all . RACHEL GARLAND DE ANGELIS Oh , hell ! ROBERT EPSTEIN Why ? RACHEL GARLAND DE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adore , it 's flattery . p. 71 ROBERT EPSTEIN ( Laughing . ) I 'll do my best . RACHEL GARLAND DE ANGELIS Oh  --  speaking of flattery  --  did I tell you Irving hates the title ? ROBERT EPSTEIN MRS . MAESTRO ? He hates that ? RACHEL GARLAND DE ANGELIS Yes . ROBERT EPSTEIN Well , he 's wrong . I know he 's a powerhouse agent but that does n't make him an expert on titles . RACHEL GARLAND DE ANGELIS Maybe it 's because he represents Vito and his book , too . ROBERT EPSTEIN Doubtless . By the way , does Vito know he 's representing you ? RACHEL GARLAND DE ANGELIS He does n't even know I 'm writing a book . ROBERT EPSTEIN ( Amazed . ) What ? RACHEL GARLAND DE ANGELIS He 'll find out soon enough . ( SHE looks at her watch . ) Any minute now . They should 've been here an hour ago . Plane late , probably . ROBERT EPSTEIN ( Putting on his jacket . ) I 'm leaving . RACHEL GARLAND DE ANGELIS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ EPSTEIN I took it for granted  --  I do n't know why  --  that he knew about this project . I certainly do n't want to be in the room  --  or in the house , even , when he finds out . Or in New York City . Or New York State ! RACHEL GARLAND DE ANGELIS But why should he object ? He suggested it . ROBERT EPSTEIN He did ? RACHEL GARLAND DE ANGELIS Of course . He said , " Write your own book . " In fact , he said it twice . ROBERT EPSTEIN And did he also suggest that you do it with me ? RACHEL GARLAND DE ANGELIS ( Thinks . ) I do n't think so . ROBERT EPSTEIN And how 's he going to react to that idea ? RACHEL GARLAND DE ANGELIS Apoplectically , I hope . ROBERT EPSTEIN Goodbye . RACHEL GARLAND DE ANGELIS Do n't be silly . ROBERT EPSTEIN Silly ? Do you remember my last encounter with him in this room ? It was like being in an earthquake  --  one that was out to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  I 'll move back in after you tell him : ( a ) that you 're writing a book ; ( b ) that Irving 's your agent ; and ( c ) God help us all  --  that you 're doing it with me . Until then  --  p. 73 VITO 'S VOICE ( Booms out in the hall . ) Hollo ! RACHEL GARLAND DE ANGELIS Too late . ROBERT EPSTEIN Damn ! VITO 'S VOICE Hollo ! RACHEL GARLAND DE ANGELIS Hollo ! VITO 'S VOICE We home ! ( VITO comes into the study . HE stands for a moment arms outstretched . ) VITO DE ANGELIS Bon voyage ! ( HE has not yet removed his fur-collared coat , nor his large cashmere hat from Gelot , Paris , nor his beige kid gloves . HE goes at once to Rachel , embraces her , kisses her again and again and begins to cry . SHE comforts him . HE is facing away from ROBERT who takes this opportunity to get out . As HE nears the door , however , IRIS comes in . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost collides with Robert . ) IRIS PEABODY Bob ! ( THEY embrace and kiss each other 's cheeks . They are old pals . On the word " Bob , " VITO stops crying and gives a start in the manner of a man who has been stabbed in the back . HE turns  --  in slow motion  --  in time to see the kissing . VITO and ROBERT exchange a long look . VITO and RACHEL exchange a longer look . VITO and IRIS exchange the longest look . Then IRIS-RACHEL ; ROBERT-IRIS ; ROBERT-RACHEL . We note that VITO is now a shade taller than Iris . SHE is still in flats , HE has taken to wearing lifts . VITO starts moving toward Robert . ROBERT stands his ground. ) p. 74 VITO DE ANGELIS ( In all cordiality . ) Bob ! ( HE embraces him . ) What you are doing here ? I thought you go back to Nova Scotia . ROBERT EPSTEIN Martha 's Vineyard . ( ERIC and BRUCE come in with the tea tables . THEY wear pastel green jackets . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) VITO DE ANGELIS ( To Bruce . ) Eric ! Bon voyage ! BRUCE Bruce . VITO DE ANGELIS ( To Eric . ) Bruce ! Bon voyage ! ERIC Eric . VITO DE ANGELIS Welcome home ! ERIC Thank you . BRUCE Maestro . ( HE takes Vito 's hat and coat . RACHEL begins serving tea . ) RACHEL GARLAND DE ANGELIS ( To Robert . ) He gets them right sometimes . ( ERIC and BRUCE leave . ) VITO DE ANGELIS ( To Robert . ) So you know Miss Peabody , no ? ROBERT EPSTEIN Yes . p. 75 IRIS PEABODY Yes . Bobby 's done seven books for me . ROBERT EPSTEIN Seven and a half , actually . VITO DE ANGELIS A half ? ( An awkward pause . A touchy subject . ) RACHEL GARLAND DE ANGELIS Tea , everyone ! ROBERT EPSTEIN I really must go . RACHEL GARLAND DE ANGELIS Go where ? You live here . ( VITO 's teacup breaks the law of gravity and goes flying off in the manner of the lobster in Act I. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . VITO is scalded , screams , jumps up and upsets one of the tea tables . ERIC and BRUCE run in . The room is suddenly a mess . Moreover , this time there are more helping hands , adding to the confusion . ERIC and BRUCE , ROBERT and IRIS and RACHEL all work away until everything is put right . ERIC and BRUCE leave . The OTHERS resume the places and attitudes they had before the accident . RACHEL pours expertly and graciously throughout the following . ) RACHEL GARLAND DE ANGELIS Cream or lemon ? IRIS PEABODY Both . No . Neither . VITO DE ANGELIS Houston was great . Fifteen calls . IRIS PEABODY Sixteen , Maestro. p. 76 VITO DE ANGELIS I think only fifteen . IRIS PEABODY And San Francisco  --  eighteen . VITO DE ANGELIS San Francisco they always applaud much . RACHEL GARLAND DE ANGELIS The cold and damp I expect . ( ROBERT laughs and makes a note . ) VITO DE ANGELIS In Los Angeles I broke one flute player . Missed two cues in the Brahms . ( HE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! I kicked him . RACHEL GARLAND DE ANGELIS  --  kicked him out ? IRIS PEABODY No , kicked him . VITO DE ANGELIS Was a great tour . ( And now MAESTRO VITO DE ANGELIS  --  or more specifically , the actor playing him  --  performs an astonishing tour de force . HE takes us on the six week tour , conducting eight different orchestras and six soloists . We will hear string sections , solo flutes , percussion , brass sections , violin solos , piano solos , full orchestral swells , everything . ) In Detroit , we do Mahler ( Performing the Mahler Ninth , in full voice , HE reproduces the climax with the Chorale . ) Chicago , all Tchaikovsky  --  fiddle concerto with Itzhak  --  easy . We do it many times . ( HE renders the key theme of Tchaikovsky 's Violin Concerto in D , movingly . We should be able to hear the passionate , sighing violin. ) p. 77 RACHEL GARLAND DE ANGELIS ( All maternal sympathy . ) What 's a matter , Tchaikovsky ? VITO DE ANGELIS Cleveland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Concerto in A for Clarinet . ) One Brahms .

RACHEL GARLAND DE ANGELIS And how 's the book coming ? ( VITO and IRIS exchange a look. ) p. 78 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GARLAND DE ANGELIS Oh , do ! IRIS PEABODY  --  not well . VITO DE ANGELIS No time . No time . People  --  stupid people think conductor stands up , throws the arms  --  is his job . Is the nothing of his job . Preparation . Preparation . Takes the time . RACHEL GARLAND DE ANGELIS ( To Iris . ) You should 've come home when you saw it was n't going to  --  IRIS PEABODY The Maestro kept thinking things would  --  VITO DE ANGELIS Yes , yes . Well  --  ( HE is anxious to change the subject . ) And what you doing now , Bob ? ( ROBERT stalls by gulping some tea . ) RACHEL GARLAND DE ANGELIS He 's helping me to write my book : MRS . MAESTRO . ( There is no stopping it . VITO is propelled to his feet like Hugo Zachinni , the human cannonball . HIS cup and saucer make a second journey . ERIC and BRUCE arrive with dispatch . ERIC manages , miraculously , to catch the cup ; BRUCE gets the saucer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The clean-up TEAM goes to work . It takes less time this time . After all , they are becoming practiced . In a thrice , all is as before . ERIC and BRUCE leave . There is a moment of polite tea drinking . ) VITO DE ANGELIS ( Finally , to Rachel . ) Is that so ? ROBERT EPSTEIN ( To Iris . ) She 's a real writer , Bunny . Keep an eye on her . VITO DE ANGELIS Who is Bunny ? IRIS PEABODY Oh  --  just a silly nickname . VITO DE ANGELIS I do n't like it . ( To Rachel . ) You are calling your book the name MRS . MAESTRO ? RACHEL GARLAND DE ANGELIS Nice , is n't it ? VITO DE ANGELIS Change it ! RACHEL GARLAND DE ANGELIS Why ? VITO DE ANGELIS I do n't like it . RACHEL GARLAND DE ANGELIS Neither does my agent . Irving Paul Lazar . ( This announcement sends VITO flying up again , but this time THEY are ready for him . RACHEL grabs his cup . ROBERT steadies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is avoided. ) p. 80 RACHEL GARLAND DE ANGELIS Do you mind us having the same agent ? VITO DE ANGELIS He is not my agent . RACHEL GARLAND DE ANGELIS I thought he was . VITO DE ANGELIS No more . Not since now . Call him up Irish and tell him he is finish . IRIS PEABODY I 'm afraid that 's impossible , Maestro . He has your contract . VITO DE ANGELIS I ca n't fire him ? IRIS PEABODY No . VITO DE ANGELIS Then I kill him . RACHEL GARLAND DE ANGELIS Not a good idea . VITO DE ANGELIS When you book will be finish ? RACHEL GARLAND DE ANGELIS When will yours ? VITO DE ANGELIS ( To Iris . ) When ? IRIS PEABODY That depends on you , Maestro . VITO DE ANGELIS Quick . No more tour now . We finish quick . IRIS PEABODY Good . VITO DE ANGELIS Maybe two weeks . IRIS PEABODY Oh , I doubt that . p. 81 VITO DE ANGELIS Maybe three weeks . IRIS PEABODY Make it six . RACHEL GARLAND DE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DE ANGELIS ( To Iris . ) Three weeks . RACHEL GARLAND DE ANGELIS Sort of like Sotheby 's , is n't it ? ( SHE and ROBERT laugh . Vito and Iris do not . Another polite tea drinking pause . ) IRIS PEABODY Houston was beautiful . ROBERT EPSTEIN ( A pause . ) Is this Earl Grey tea ? RACHEL GARLAND DE ANGELIS No . Hu-Kwa . ROBERT EPSTEIN Delicious . VITO DE ANGELIS Is cat piss ! ( HE goes to the bar tray and takes a swig of vodka . The longest pause of them all . Bottle in hand . ) Cara mia  --  I may see you for one two minutes ? RACHEL GARLAND DE ANGELIS Of course . IRIS PEABODY ( Rising . ) Why do n't we go . ROBERT EPSTEIN Yes . p. 82 VITO DE ANGELIS NO ! ( ROBERT and IRIS sit . ) RACHEL GARLAND DE ANGELIS Excuse us , please ? VITO DE ANGELIS ( Beaming . ) Do n't go . We be right back . In sixteen bars . RACHEL GARLAND DE ANGELIS ( To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! ( HE signals his assent . VITO , still clutching the bottle , politely escorts RACHEL to the door , follows her and closes it . ) IRIS PEABODY How 's the Island ? ROBERT EPSTEIN Still there , thank God . IRIS PEABODY Good . ROBERT EPSTEIN How 's Larry ? IRIS PEABODY Still there . ROBERT EPSTEIN You did n't say , " thank God . " IRIS PEABODY Did n't I ? ( Now , as suddenly as a breaking thunderstorm , from above , we hear VITO 's voice raised in shattering anger . HE is shouting  --  in Italian . To our amazement , we next hear RACHEL topping him in both emotion and volume . Remember she is a trained singer with a cultivated and powerful voice . The volume of the sounds of battle fluctuate as the participants go up and down the stairs . For text of offstage argument , see dialogue immediately following final scene . During the above : ) p. 83 ROBERT EPSTEIN What 's happening at Little , Brown ? IRIS PEABODY Oh , you know publishing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretend to ignore the upstairs excitement where VITO , in an attempt to out-shout Rachel , cracks his voice . Still HE continues . RACHEL does not wait for him to stop , but overlaps . THEY are both at the top of their lungs , 7.8 on the Richter Scale . For a time they sound like two hysterical viragos in vocal combat . Even those of us who have no Italian recognize that some extremely bad language is being exchanged . ERIC and BRUCE come in and clear . THEY , too , appear to be oblivious to the goings-on above . ) ERIC ( To Iris . ) Good trip  --  BRUCE  --  Miss Peabody ? IRIS PEABODY Fascinating . BRUCE But tiring  --  ERIC  --  I 'll bet . IRIS PEABODY Indeed . ERIC Have you been up  --  BRUCE  --  to your room yet ? IRIS PEABODY No . BRUCE Oh  --  wait till you see it . p. 84 ERIC She 's redone it . BRUCE It 's adorable . ERIC We helped her . BRUCE It 's really divine ! IRIS PEABODY Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not at all . ( THEY are gone . ) ROBERT EPSTEIN It is splendid , I must say . IRIS PEABODY You 've seen it ? ROBERT EPSTEIN She showed it to me . It 's right across from my room . IRIS PEABODY Bob ROBERT EPSTEIN Yes ? IRIS PEABODY Listen  --  I know it seems inappropriate  --  unseemly , even  --  but , Bob , this is something I 've  --  it 's like nothing I 've ever even read about  --  let alone known . ROBERT EPSTEIN ( Kindly . ) Hero worship , maybe , a little ? IRIS PEABODY It was at first , yes . But it 's all changed now . I live in another world . He makes me into a better person I wake up every morning thinking of him . And every time I see him I feel  --  gratitude. p. 85 ROBERT EPSTEIN Careful , though . You 're sure it 's him you love and not his image ? IRIS PEABODY Now , how would I know that ? I love what he is and was and is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea of us . And even though we 've never said " I love you " to each other  --  well , not in those words , anyway  --  I know that he does and that I do . Maybe we do n't say it because it 's something more than love ( The NOISE from above stops so abruptly that ROBERT and IRIS spring to their feet . What could have happened ? Simultaneous coronaries ? Murder ? THEY look up through the ceiling and at each other . THEY communicate wordlessly . Should we do anything ? The door opens . VITO and RACHEL come in , cheerfully . HE still carries the bottle  --  upside down . ) RACHEL GARLAND DE ANGELIS There we are ! That did n't take long , did it ? VITO DE ANGELIS Business . ( HE goes to a wall panel and touches a button on the stereo master control . The dulcet sounds of Delius fill the room : A Walk Through Paradise Garden . ) RACHEL GARLAND DE ANGELIS ( Sotto voce to Robert . ) His ace is trumped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ha ! VITO DE ANGELIS ( To Iris , pointing to a speaker . ) My Delius . With The Tokyo . Superb . Delius he is much Japanese .

Basta ! We all have drink now ! RACHEL GARLAND DE ANGELIS ( Happily . ) Why not ? ( VITO starts for the bar tray . ROBERT intercepts him . ) ROBERT EPSTEIN Let me . VITO DE ANGELIS ( Magnanimously . ) Why not ? ROBERT EPSTEIN ( At the bar tray . ) Martinis O.K. ? I 'm an expert . IRIS PEABODY White wine for me . ROBERT EPSTEIN Right .

Barbetta 's , San Domenico 's , Romeo Salta 's ? VITO DE ANGELIS What you talking  --  ? That 's all Italian ! IRIS PEABODY Yes . VITO DE ANGELIS I hate Italian  --  I had enough Italian for two lifes ! RACHEL GARLAND DE ANGELIS ( Returns . ) They 'd love to . VITO DE ANGELIS Where we go , cara mia ? RACHEL GARLAND DE ANGELIS Grenouille ? Le Cirque ? Chantilly ? VITO DE ANGELIS ( Suddenly . ) I got it ! We go downtown to Ratners . RACHEL GARLAND DE ANGELIS But they do n't take reservations .

IRIS PEABODY I 'm dying to read it . RACHEL GARLAND DE ANGELIS Well , you will soon enough . ( VITO listens with interest but says nothing . The fact that he has been checkmated upstairs colors his behavior . HE floats over to the bar tray and hovers impatiently . ) IRIS PEABODY ( To Rachel . ) I hope you wo n't think I 'm prying  --  RACHEL GARLAND DE ANGELIS I wo n't if you are n't . IRIS PEABODY But  --  do you have a publisher ? RACHEL GARLAND DE ANGELIS Oh , I 'm leaving that all to Irving . IRIS PEABODY May I speak to him ? RACHEL GARLAND DE ANGELIS By all means . IRIS PEABODY Because I have an idea that might just be super ! RACHEL GARLAND DE ANGELIS What is it ? ( The martinis are finished . While ROBERT fixes Iris 's white wine , VITO takes the shaker and begins to drink out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maybe more . ROBERT brings Iris her drink . When HE returns to pour the martinis , HE can not find the shaker . He is mystified until HE looks across the room and sees VITO drinking out of it . HE leaves and returns shortly with another shaker and makes another batch . Meanwhile : ) p. 89 IRIS PEABODY Would n't it be stupendous  --  if we could buy your book from Irving and then arrange to have them published simultaneously ? RACHEL GARLAND DE ANGELIS Would it ? IRIS PEABODY Fantastic ! ( SHE places posters in the air . ) MAESTRO by Vito De Angelis . MRS . MAESTRO by Rachel Garland De Angelis . ( VITO , horrified at this idea , finishes the contents of the shaker in one long draught . ) IRIS PEABODY ( Continuing on fire . ) They might even have sort of matching bindings and could be marketed as a set - boxed . RACHEL GARLAND DE ANGELIS ( With a glance in Vito 's direction . ) But what about the people who are only interested in mine ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ empty shaker and begins to drink again . ) IRIS PEABODY The sets would be only for those who want both . RACHEL GARLAND DE ANGELIS You 'd better let me talk that over with Irving . And Bobby . VITO DE ANGELIS ( Rather pathetically . ) And me ? p. 90 RACHEL GARLAND DE ANGELIS Certainly and you , my love . ( VITO manages a pained smile . ) IRIS PEABODY Rachel  --  I do thank you for my room . The boys told me . RACHEL GARLAND DE ANGELIS Oh , those big-mouths . It was meant to be a surprise . IRIS PEABODY I 'm sure it will be . RACHEL GARLAND DE ANGELIS I hope you wo n't mind about the bed . IRIS PEABODY The bed ? RACHEL GARLAND DE ANGELIS I took out the twins and put in a king-size . IRIS PEABODY Oh , I love a big bed ! ( VITO takes another gulp , empties the shaker and returns unsteadily to the tray .

We move the twins together and put the mattresses  --  ( HE gestures suiting the action to the word . HE pushes two armchairs together . HE stretches across the two chairs as IRIS tries to grab him. ) p. 91 IRIS PEABODY Vito  --  ! ( VITO falls off the chairs , realizing his gaffe . IRIS gets her briefcase and purse and runs out of the room . VITO looks at Rachel , looks for Iris . ) VITO DE ANGELIS Irish ? ( HE gets up and goes through the door , calling . ) Irish ?

( HE sets up his laptop computer and switches on the tiny microcassette recorder . ) Oh  --  before you mention Iris , the reader 's going to want to know why you condoned all these infidelities across the years . After all , there 's such a thing as being too civilized . RACHEL GARLAND DE ANGELIS Well , if the reader paid attention to the first part  --  then he/she would know that I knew the sort of man I was marrying . He 'd been , all his life , a charmer , a ladies ' man , a Lothario  --  why would I believe he was going to change overnight ? In fact , I was surprised it did n't happen sooner .

He 's looking for a past His trouble is that his wife understands him . ( SHE looks off , sadly . ) And I sympathize because I live with the same fears . Anxieties . Dreads . Is it almost over ? Is it over ? Was it a success ? What have I missed ? ROBERT EPSTEIN Is n't it curious that someone as sensitive and intelligent as you ca n't see that  --  ( HIS voice trails off .

ROBERT studies it uncertainly for a moment  --  then , reluctantly , magnanimously , takes it . HE goes , closing the door . VITO and IRIS are in each other 's arms instantly . They silently exchange affection , vows , desires , passions , and love for a time . Outside , two fire engines streak by  --  SIRENS wailing , BELLS clanging . Fire ! ROBERT comes back in , stops  --  then , realizing that THEY are in the clouds , comes into the room , retrieves his notebook and pen and recorder and computer . HE leaves again . VITO and IRIS come out of it at last. ) p. 105 VITO DE ANGELIS What did he say ? IRIS PEABODY He did n't say . He yelled . He went berserk . VITO DE ANGELIS Berserk ? Where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know . Out of control . And he would n't take his ring back . I reminded him it was only a token  --  I never intended to marry him . But he would n't listen .

IRIS PEABODY No . VITO DE ANGELIS No ? IRIS PEABODY They 're wild about the idea . Proud of me and mad about you . VITO DE ANGELIS ( Confused . ) Why they are mad ? You said  --  IRIS PEABODY Admire you  --  adore you . VITO DE ANGELIS But what about the parents ? Mother father ? IRIS PEABODY I mean the parents  --  my parents . They adore you . p. 106 VITO DE ANGELIS Why ? IRIS PEABODY You know my father 's an opera buff  --  and has been on The Boston Symphony Board for ages  --  and my mother has n't missed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in forty years .

The more richer the people , the more want free passes . I take care . Also  --  they want  --  they come to rehearsals . IRIS PEABODY They 'll die ! VITO DE ANGELIS Yes  --  well  --  we all got to die sometime ! IRIS PEABODY I mean they 'll love it . VITO DE ANGELIS  --  and the brothers , sisters ? IRIS PEABODY I have n't any .

VITO DE ANGELIS ( Astonished . ) No ? IRIS PEABODY No . I 'll go upstairs and wait for you . You tell her . VITO DE ANGELIS ( Stalling . ) Tonight ? IRIS PEABODY Now ! I ca n't leave here until I know where I stand . Is that clear ? ( VITO nods , rather sheepishly . IRIS gives him a sisterly peck on the cheek and leaves . VITO walks the last mile to the intercom. ) p. 108 ERIC 'S VOICE Yes ? VITO DE ANGELIS You tell the Signora I got to see her . Now . ERIC 'S VOICE Of course , Maestro . ( VITO goes to the bar tray . HE takes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . HE looks at it , then drinks it in one long , slow draught . Under his breath he rehearses what he will say to Rachel . As HE practices , RACHEL comes in . ) RACHEL GARLAND DE ANGELIS Yes , sir . ( VITO comes to her and puts his arms around her . A long , warm embrace that has everything in it but love . THEY are clinging to one another in the manner of two people going down with the ship . Thus joined , HE walks HER around the room . Finally : ) VITO DE ANGELIS Rachel . Please sit . RACHEL GARLAND DE ANGELIS No . You please sit . ( SHE puts him into an easy chair . ) VITO DE ANGELIS I want to tell you something . RACHEL GARLAND DE ANGELIS No need . VITO DE ANGELIS Huh ? RACHEL GARLAND DE ANGELIS It 's in the air . I 've been breathing it for weeks . Vito , dear . You want to tell me that we 've had a remarkable marriage , that I 've been an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( VITO seems about to speak , but SHE silences him with a palm ) p. 109 RACHEL GARLAND DE ANGELIS But that there comes a time for a man  --  a desperate time  --  when he feels that if only life would give him one more chance , he could take it and have a truly happy ending . And this means breaking out of the trap  --  it means a kind of transfusion of youth  --  and a new outlook  --  and yes you love me  --  but in a different way . You 've earned the right . It 's not too late . Look at Casals . At eighty-two , he married his nineteen-year-old pupil , Carmen , and they had thrilling years together . Look at Segovia  --  became a father at eighty-one and then had a little son to occupy him . ( VITO tries again , but it is no use . SHE has taken command . ) RACHEL GARLAND DE ANGELIS We must remain friends always . More than friends . We must try to remember all our great times and years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mishaps . After all , our years are a near eternity . Everything wears out in time  --  machines , people , buildings  --  even a marriage . You want to remind me that we really have had the best of it , have n't we ? It would probably be all downhill from now on . And anyway , you feel you 're sort of falling apart . More and more ailments and symptoms and pains and why should you burden me with them ? Let someone younger and stronger take over . You want to assure me that this , in the end , will doubtless turn out best for me . And , darling , I 'm not sure I do n't agree with everything you say . So of course you have your freedom if you want it . I 've always given you everything you wanted if it was in my power to give it and I 'm certainly not going to stop now . I 've been to see a new lawyer  --  Edgar Halloran , a specialist  --  and he says that in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am to dictate the terms of the settlement . ( As she continues SHE goes to the shelves and begins to look for something . The search takes HER , on the library steps , high up . ) They are as follows : From the day the decree becomes final , I want no money , no alimony , no share of your income from any source . However . This house and everything in it will be mine . Also the condo in Palm Beach . ( SHE finds the compact disc she has been searching for and comes down . ) Also my share of the royalties on any and all recordings , compact discs , cassettes , videocassettes , or films made prior to our divorce . ( SHE puts the compact disc onto the stereo and sets the volume control . ) Also the Rolls and the Bentley . The boat . Also all bank accounts , bonds , stocks , now jointly held . p. 110 VITO DE ANGELIS ( Stands , stunned and in shock . ) But Holy Madre di Dio , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RACHEL GARLAND DE ANGELIS ( Sweetly . ) Love , darling  --  love ! ( SHE touches the " play " button . MUSIC blares forth : The Wedding March from Lohengrin . SHE sails out in triumph . VITO stands frozen in shock . The MUSIC and LIGHTS fade fast. ) p. 111 Act 2 , Scene 3 ACT II : Scene 3 A mellow evening . It is April again . The dining room , entirely CANDLELIT . The two candelabra on the table are reinforced by six wall sconces . They combine to create a gentle , romantic ambience . From the background , the soft SOUND of Vito 's recording of Tchaikovsky 's Romeo and Juliet with The Philadelphia Symphony Orchestra will continue throughout . Seated at the table : VITO , IRIS , RACHEL and ROBERT . THEY are all in evening dress . Rachel , in her most dazzling Halston ; Iris , a springtime sprite in her colorful Laura Ashley . Vito 's dinner jacket , made by Johnson and Mari in Paris , is impeccable . The Van Cleef and Arpels ruby and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , waistcoat , and tie are matchless . Robert looks pretty snazzy , too . The key to the playing of this scene is : EVERYONE is charmingly tipsy . Bruce and Eric are in pink jackets this time . ERIC and BRUCE serve the crpes suzette . First Vito , then the ladies , then Robert . The flame flickers up from each plate . IRIS PEABODY Is n't this festive ! VITO DE ANGELIS Cosa vuol dire , festive ? RACHEL GARLAND DE ANGELIS ( Italian . ) Festive . p. 112 VITO DE ANGELIS Oh , sure ! Sure ! RACHEL GARLAND DE ANGELIS ( To Iris . ) If you need an interpreter , Iris  --  I may be available . VITO DE ANGELIS No , no ! No good idea ! RACHEL GARLAND DE ANGELIS As you wish . ( Vito was the first to be served , so the FLAME on his plate flickers out . ) VITO DE ANGELIS Eric ! Bruce ! ERIC Yes  --  BRUCE  --  Maestro ? VITO DE ANGELIS ( Adolescently truculent . ) Why everybody has the fire and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Oh  --  BRUCE  --  sorry  --  ERIC  --  Maestro . ( THEY rush to replace the omission . EACH one brings a bottle . Bruce , the Curacao ; Eric the Cognac . THEY pour the spirits onto Vito 's plate , overdoing it in their excitement . BRUCE lights it . A column of flame three feet high shoots into the air , startling EVERYONE as they jump away . VITO leaps to his feet and steps back. ) p. 113 RACHEL GARLAND DE ANGELIS ( Calmly . ) Eat it while it 's hot , dear ! ( IRIS and ROBERT laugh . The flame subsides . VITO sits . ) VITO DE ANGELIS Grazie . ( ERIC and BRUCE retire . ) IRIS PEABODY Rachel  --  may I thank you again ? RACHEL GARLAND DE ANGELIS No need . IRIS PEABODY There is for me . When you invited us  --  I can tell you now  --  I was frightened . RACHEL GARLAND DE ANGELIS Of what ? IRIS PEABODY The situation . But you 've made it so  --  uh  --  easy and simple and  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't be so hard . ROBERT EPSTEIN How long in San Francisco ? IRIS PEABODY Just a day and two nights . RACHEL GARLAND DE ANGELIS Tokyo 's a difficult flight . Try to sleep as much as you can . IRIS PEABODY I will . RACHEL GARLAND DE ANGELIS ( Making conversation . ) What about other plans ? Everything settled ? p. 114 IRIS PEABODY Well , not everything  --  but it 's not going to be the Big Wedding my family was after . ROBERT EPSTEIN Boston ? IRIS PEABODY Oh , yes . VITO DE ANGELIS Very good string section , The Boston . Silverstein . Concertmaster . ( HE kisses his fingertips . ) Magnifico ! IRIS PEABODY  --  But of course it wo n't be till we get back from Japan in June . Probably July or August . ROBERT EPSTEIN August . I ca n't make it in July .

RACHEL GARLAND DE ANGELIS  --  Seems silly , in the circumstances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ANGELIS Change it ! IRIS PEABODY No , no  --  too late . RACHEL GARLAND DE ANGELIS Is it , Bob ? ROBERT EPSTEIN I 'm afraid so . IRIS PEABODY ( To Vito . ) Is it all right to tell about the big stuff ? VITO DE ANGELIS ( Generously . ) Oh , sure . p. 115 IRIS PEABODY ( Flushed with excitement . ) Well  --  it 's not definite  --  my father had a little something to do with it . It 's just that we may be taking over The Boston Symphony year after next . VITO DE ANGELIS We ? IRIS PEABODY We . VITO DE ANGELIS I see . ( RACHEL and ROBERT exchange a meaningful look . ) RACHEL GARLAND DE ANGELIS  --  And will that mean moving to Boston ? VITO DE ANGELIS No ! VITO DE ANGELIS Yes .

IRIS PEABODY  --  and when he gets moody , for instance . Is it better to try and cheer him up or leave him alone ? RACHEL GARLAND DE ANGELIS  --  depends on what he 's moody about . IRIS PEABODY Uh-huh . VITO DE ANGELIS Hey ! Do n't talk about me like I 'm not here ! I am here . IRIS PEABODY ( As before. )  --  and about quarrels . Would you say it 's better to win  --  or just give in ? RACHEL GARLAND DE ANGELIS Win . VITO DE ANGELIS Give in . IRIS PEABODY I do n't see how quarrels can be avoided .

It is strongly suggested that the entire dialogue be pre-recorded , then edited and modulated in volume to fit the onstage action . It is not necessary for the audience to hear the entire argument . VITO DE ANGELIS ( Offstage . ) You crazy ? You crazy . I get you one doctor . Some kind good doctor for crazy . ( In Italian. ) tanto che lo penso . Sei malata nella testa . Non ti comporti come una donna  --  come una moglie . Sei pazza . ( In English . ) You bring this little son of a bitch  --  this bastard  --  this son of a bastard  --  you bring him here in my house  --  he live in my house . What do you do with him ? Sure , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book ? Why ? You crazy ? Who wants your book ? What have you got to say ? You got nothing to say . Everything to say , I will say . It is one story  --  not two stories . I will tell the story . ( In Italian . ) Buttalo fuori ! ( In English . ) You throw him out ! ( In Italian . ) Se non lo butti fuori , lo butto fuori io . ( In English . ) You do n't throw him out , I throw him out . ( In Italian . ) Forse vi butto fuori tutti e due . ( In English . ) This is my house . How you got the nerve  --  how you got the chutzpah . You have someone live in my house and you do n't tell me . I call the police . No , no , lawyers  --  I call lawyers , they will see . You want to give me back my heart trouble ? You want to give me back my atrial fibrillations . That 's what you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  I give you some atrial fibrillation . I do n't act like some fool . ( In Italian . ) Mi vuol far becco ? Mi vuol mettere le corna ? ( In English . ) You are foolish  --  you are a foolish fool . You forget you are no more young . This young boy he is not for you . I am getting my sickness again . Is your fault . You got no rights . Why you do this to me ? You woman  --  you bad woman ! You bitch  --  yes , bitch . You behave to me in this way after all I do for you all my life . Shaddop , shaddop. p. 127 RACHEL GARLAND DE ANGELIS ( From off . ) If you want to discuss this matter seriously and sensibly and quietly , Vito , I 'm prepared to do so . But if you are going to shout , I 'm going to leave . ( SHE shouts . ) Did you hear me ? I wo n't have any shouting . We are supposed to be two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more important in life than the ability to see it all from the other person 's point of view . ( In Italian . ) E non voglio pi sentir parlare di " casa tua . " Capito ? ( In English . ) This is not your house , it is our house  --  no , come to think of it , it is not our house , it is my house . This house is owned by the Pro-Musica Corporation , of which I am the president . I did n't want to be , but you and those lawyers of yours and those fancy accountants insisted upon it . So as it turns out , I am the president and you work for me . And I would strongly advise you to behave yourself . ( SHE shouts . ) And do n't shout . Stop shouting . Do you hear ? And now I have a few questions . I would like to ask you . Who went off on a long tour and left me behind to fend for myself ? You . You . Who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expected me simply to turn the other cheek ? You , my dear maestro , you . And who continually got us into financial straits over and over again ? You , and you . And who always got us out ? I and I. So I 'll have none of this holier than thou attitude  --  you must stop behaving like a nineteenth century man  --  like an eighteenth century man  --  like a seventeenth century man  --  like your ideal  --  your Casanova . No , no , do n't deny it , he is your hero  --  he has always been your hero . You envy him  --  you try to outdo him . No , you are quite wrong , there is nothing between young Robert and me , other than a splendid professional relationship . And if you could 've behaved with him sensibly and reasonably , your bloody damn book would be finished by now and we would not be having all this ridiculous trouble with Little , Brown and Company . So , I think we better stop all this and go downstairs and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intend to be a good sport and I advise you to do so as well . Is that clear ? Now stop it . ( SHE shouts at the top of her lungs. )
