In some ways , there is the same kind of disagreement over how this Administration should put together its economic outlook for the future , a forecast that is the underpinning of the Reagan budget . Top economic policymakers agree on the course of policy , but they often disagree on how to serve it up. // The wrinkle is that , within President Reagan ' s advisory group , there are two distinct strains of economic philosophy - the supply siders , who have pushed large business and personal tax cuts to spur savings and investment , and the monetarists , who advocate slow , steady restrictive growth in the money supply as a cure for inflation. // // Can Mean a Sluggish Economy // In the present environment of continued inflation - although it appears to be abating - the conflict is one of growth for the supply siders versus a restrictive monetary policy for the monetarists , which with continued inflation can mean a very sluggish economy. // The breakfast group , although it includes four people , is known as " the troika , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Treasury Department , the Office of Management and Budget and the Council of Economic Advisers - that are represented . The four members are Treasury Secretary Donald T. Regan ; David A. Stockman , the budget office ' s director ; Murray L. Weidenbaum , chairman of the economic advisers , and , representing the White House , Martin Anderson , Assistant to the President for Policy Development . About every four weeks , Paul A. Volcker , the Federal Reserve Board ' s chairman , is invited to the breakfast meeting . <> <> Quick Meetings , Cryptic Talk // The meetings , according to one observer , are quick , much of the talk is cryptic or in shorthand and there is an effort to reach decisions in a minimum of time. // Mr. Regan , who has poached eggs with bacon , is said to play the role of an " experienced market practitioner , " with strong confidence in his judgments . Mr. Weidenbaum , who has poached eggs without bacon , by his own definition is the pragmatist . Others refer to him as the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Stockman , who has his eggs scrambled with bacon , tends to argue from figures and insists on the " credibility of the numbers . " It is a fried egg with bacon for Mr. Anderson , who , said one Administration member , asks " what if " - an often unanswerable question. // When the group meets , it discusses a myriad of economic issues . But in the coming weeks and months , more and more of the conversation will turn to the economic outlook for 1982 and 1983 , which has to be prepared as part of the budget for the 1983 fiscal year , and the economic report of the President , both due in January. // The group ' s job will be to either pass on or decide on the key issues in the forecast , before it goes to President Reagan for approval . If there is still disagreement , the decisions are framed for the President to make . <> <> Agreement in Years Past // In both the Carter and the Ford administrations , there has been general agreement among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which meant " there were no big debates on our forecast , " said Alan Greenspan , the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers in the Ford administration. // But the strains within this Administration ' s economic advisory group now leave a wide swath for economic judgments to give effect to the forecast . In fact , in comparison to the past , the troika may have to bring the competitors together . " What do they pay me $69 , 000 for , " Mr. Regan asked rhetorically recently . " It ' s supposed to be for my judgmental ability. " // Mr. Weidenbaum said that , " to the extent that we have less historical experience " to prove how the economy will react to new programs , " it means there is more need to rely on your judgments . " But , he hastened to add , as have other forecasts from previous administrations , there is nothing wrong with judgments. // In fact , one of the key judgmental parts of the Administration ' s original forecast in February , dubbed " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of inflation has declined . But at the same time , another judgment , that expectations about the future would improve and interest rates would fall , has proven wrong. // The process of putting together the 1982 and 1983 forecast is moving ahead , but because the Administration ' s people have not gone through this whole process together before it is hard to nail down their judgments . <> <> Starts at Staff Levels // The assembly starts at the staff levels of the Treasury , O.M.B. and the economic advisers council . From there , it goes to Jerry L. Jordan of the council , Lawrence A. Kudlow of the budget office , and Paul Craig Roberts of the Treasury , where the main forecast is assembled . The crucial assumptions and differences are outlined for the troika. // Mr. Weidenbaum , while a pragmatist , has the strong monetarist views of Mr. Jordan behind him . Mr. Kudlow puts another monetarist tinge behind Mr. Stockman . Behind Mr. Regan , there is the strong supply side disposition of Mr. Roberts and his boss , Norman B. Ture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Regan is also influenced by Beryl W. Sprinkel , Under Secretary for Monetary Affairs , a leading monetarist. // The problem now is for the troika to pull the divergent sides together and the onset of the recession the President called two weeks ago will make the job tougher. // A forecast of declining inflation , but with low economic growth and a continued tight monetary policy would be in line with the monetarists - and in the light of short-term predictions from private forecasters , could be the most accurate . <> <> Less Revenue , Bigger Deficit // But this means less revenue for the Government in the 1982 fiscal year because of lower inflation and lower growth , which means the $43 billion deficit for 1982 will swell and the promise of a balanced budget in 1984 may be impossible to keep. // And , at the same time , the supply siders would not be getting their growth , despite the biggest personal and business tax cut in history . And a pessimistic forecast would deny for now two of the three key promises President Reagan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ While still trying to sell more than $100 billion of further budget cuts over the next three years , the President could only point to declining inflation. // These are the forces now in play . And packaging them in the next forecast - which will spell out the hoped for future of the already troubled Reagan program , is what the troika ' s breakfasts are all about. //
