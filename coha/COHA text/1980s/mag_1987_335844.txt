It is 11 a.m. , an hour before opening time . Already the queue at 36 Kropotkinskaya Street extends around the corner of the elegant green-and-cream 19th century building . People are waiting patiently for a chance to experience one of the first visible signs of economic reform , a free-enterprise restaurant . " We 've got a big problem here , " Manager Andrei Fyodorov says . " Too many customers . " <P> Some problem . Fyodorov , 44 , is co-chairman of the eight-member cooperative that opened Moscow 's first such venture last March . He and his seven partners , most of them experienced cooks or waiters , are investing in a business that will prosper  --  or fail  --  without government interference . " We never imagined we would do this well , " says the energetic , chain-smoking co- chairman . Cafe 36 Kropotkinskaya , as they named the restaurant ( bureaucrats wanted it to be called Cafe Cooperator ) , is a consequence of Mikhail Gorbachev 's reforms legalizing small-scale private enterprise . One of the goals is to improve the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than in Soviet restaurants , which are notorious for rude service and poor food . <P> " Three of us put up a total of 4,500 rubles ( $6,750 ) of our own savings , " says Fyodorov , a former hotel food-service director . " The state bank loaned us 50,000 rubles ( ( $75,000 ) ) interest-free to pay for renovating and furnishing this building . We have to pay that back over five years . We got another 10,000 rubles ' ( ( $15,000 ) ) credit at 3% interest for start-up costs , but we 've only needed 5,000 . " The loans paid for the restoration and redecoration of an elegant old building in turn-of-the-century style , including damask wall coverings and antique light fixtures . Although the part- time waitresses and kitchen help must be paid salaries no less than they would earn in public catering jobs , Fyodorov says the partners expect to earn a minimum of 350 rubles ( $525 ) a month each and possibly more than 500 rubles ( $750 ) . The average Soviet salary is about 190 rubles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the partners put in 16-hour days , which began early in the morning at farmers ' markets and collective farms , where they paid premium prices for top-quality meat and produce . Says Fyodorov : " Before , we were accustomed to having somebody tell us everything . Now we have to think for ourselves . " Despite the long line outside , Fyodorov worries . " Who knows how it will be a year from now ? There are 50 other cooperatives planning to open restaurants in Moscow , and soon we 'll face harsh old capitalist competition . " <P> One way the Kropotkinskaya Cafe is already competing is by serving the rarest thing in the Moscow restaurant world : courtesy . Customers are greeted by a courtly doorman who apologizes for the delay . The waiters startle women by holding chairs for them . In the evenings two Moldavian musicians serenade diners with folk and gypsy tunes . Fyodorov strolls among the tables greeting customers and topping up glasses of chilled fruit juice . The restaurant so far is nonalcoholic , but the partners hope to obtain permission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blackboard , offers hors d'oeuvres of cold tongue , crudites and home-pickled vegetables . The main courses range from 2.20 rubles ( $3.30 ) for liver fried with cucumbers to 60 rubles ( $90 ) for roast suckling pig .
