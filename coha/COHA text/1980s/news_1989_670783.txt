Yet , her friends said , the 28-year-old investment banker rarely seemed to give much thought to the dangers of running at night . Then one night last week , sometime after she was seen leaving her East 83d Street apartment in running clothes at 8 : 45 , she was beaten and raped off the 102d Street transverse in a brutal attack that has left her comatose at Metropolitan General Hospital. // Although her name has been withheld by most newspapers , which normally do not publish the names of rape victims , friends and colleagues quickly learned who it was . And for the most part , they were not surprised that she had been out in the park so late. // " She was not so much of an anomaly , " said one 24-year-old woman who works where the victim did , at Salomon Brothers , and who , like others interviewed , spoke on the condition that she not be named . " Running is a nice way to unwind : it relaxes you . And when you are working on one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 24 hours a day , you run when you get the chance . " <> <> ' Very Self-Confident ' // Since she moved into a new apartment off East End Avenue in January , the young woman often - at least three or four times a week - would warm up with a half-mile jog to the Metropolitan Museum of Art , and there embark on a run that would take her four to six miles in and around Central Park . On Saturdays , she would sometimes run to work on Wall Street , and back home again , or call a friend who also ran to do a more leisurely route ; on weeknights , she occasionally ran with co-workers . Sometimes , she ran alone. // " She was very self-confident , very self-assured , " said David Brason , who was in the process of selling her the small fifth-floor apartment , with its fireplace and southern exposure , that she had sublet from him. // " She was not a very urban person , " a former neighbor said . " She did not have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York. " // The young woman , who was born in New Jersey , spent part of her childhood in a suburb of Pittsburgh where her parents still live . Her parents , who have been in New York since April 20 , have asked that her name not be published. // As a girl , she devoted herself to dance ; as she got older , that passion was supplanted by a fierce dedication to her studies , then her work , and a consuming desire to stay fit , expressed through her running , friends said. // After graduating from Wellesley College in 1982 - with a Phi Beta Kappa key and a record that never once dropped below A-minus - she worked for a year at Braxton Associates , a management consulting firm in Boston , in a job that , one Braxton employee said , routinely demanded 60 hours a week " crunching numbers. " // She left Braxton and went to work for the United States Department of State in Zimbabwe . One friend said the experience , which arose from a sense of social and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the Yale School of Management in 1984 for a two-year program , and earned a joint degree in business and international relations. // The woman , who was described as a good debater , also had a warmth and compassion that set her apart from more mechanical young achievers , her friends said . While at Wellesley , she helped organize a nutritional program at a Boston shelter for battered women , participated in Catholic student groups and worked one summer as a Congressional intern. // " She was the kind of person who could help people in her class without making it seem like she was superior , " said Len Nicols , chairman of the Wellesley economics department . " When you think of her , you think of someone who could have been a diplomat at 22. " // Her running was a constant , and one that provided a world separate from work . When she was working in Boston , friends say , she once ran to a dinner party in Brookline , a suburb , and home again to her apartment on Beacon Hill. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Nan Garland , a graphic artist at Braxton . " We used to worry that she was running too much , and eating too little . She was very thin . " <> <> A ' Private Person ' // " Everyone who knew her knew she was always running , " said Kurt Anstreicher , an associate professor of operations research at the Yale School of Management. // Friends described her personal life as sedate , her romantic involvements as long-lasting and steady . " She was always a pretty private person , " said one woman who knew her when the two worked at Braxton Associates . " Jogging and being extremely bright - those were the two areas she allowed to be exposed to the public. " // Three years ago she joined Salomon Brothers as an associate investment banker in the corporate finance department . Training first as a generalist , she made a tour of the firm ' s different groups before joining the energy and natural resources groups nine months ago. // There , as a junior member of a 10- to 12-person team , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ analyzing the assets of oil companies , consulting on public offerings , developing client relationships and putting together deals . <> <> A ' Top-Notch ' Job // A spokesman for Salomon Brothers declined to comment on her work there , but said , " To be an associate investment banker at this firm would imply you are very hard working , very intelligent and very team oriented. " // For the bankers in corporate finance , the daily strain at the office is compounded by a heavy traveling schedule . In the four months that she worked on an offering of preferred stock by a Texas oil company , the Cliffs Drilling Company , the young woman traveled with the company ' s officers and members of the Salomon team to Houston , Boston , Chicago , Lafayette , La. , and off-shore oil rigs in the Gulf of Mexico. // Douglas Swanson , executive vice president of Cliffs Drilling , said her work on the deal had been " top-notch . " But in between the company reports and the on-site visit , she managed to run . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , " said Mr. Swanson , who ran with her . " It was part of her life . Like most investment bankers , her jobs required a lot of time , and jogging was an outlet for that. " // The pressure of the work has an added dimension for some women on Wall Street . " I think women do feel that they have a shorter time frame to make their mark , " said one young associate at Salomon Brothers . " And on Wall Street , age is not a barrier for the younger ones . It is just your ideas they want to benefit from , not your experience . " <> <> Didn ' t Fit Wall Street Image // But the young woman was able to keep a perspective that again set her apart from some of her peers . " She is more well-balanced than most associates , " said a more senior investment banker . " Some people think about their deals 20 hours a day , and she was not that type. " // " If you looked at her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is some dynamo , ' " said Mr. Brason , who leased her the apartment on East 83d Street . " But when you got to know her , you realized she was a different person from the Wall Street image . She was very open . I used to ask her how she could survive in that world. " // In taking a job at Salomon , she had surprised some of her older friends , who remembered her earlier concerns about the ethics of the American corporate world . But , they said , she seemed pleased , challenged and invigorated by her job and by New York City , both of which matched her energy level. // " She loved New York , she just loved it , " said one friend living in Boston . " I think she liked the fast pace , the competitiveness . There was so much there she could do . She needed a lot of stimulation. " //
