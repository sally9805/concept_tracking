A squeeze on loan deadbeats <P> During the past 25 years , millions of students have received Federal Government loans to help defray their college expenses . But 1.5 million of them have since flunked a morality test : they have failed to repay their debts , leaving Uncle Sam holding the bag for $1.8 billion . Last year Education Department officials used a computer search to identify 46,000 federal employees among the defaulters . Result : 5,000 promptly anted up $2.3 million . Now the remaining 41,000 are being told they must pay up in 30 days or their wages will be garnisheed at the rate of 15% per paycheck ( 25% if they sue the Government and lose ) . To pressure nonfederal debtors , the Government is negotiating a plan with credit bureaus that would place a black mark on the credit ratings of citizens who are lagging in repaying their Government loans . That measure might go into effect by the end of this year .                   @ @
