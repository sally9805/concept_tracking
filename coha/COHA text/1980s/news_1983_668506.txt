An underachieving , game-obsessed teenager succeeds in circumventing the security of the North American Air Defense Command ; an intelligent , self- aware , but psychologically underdeveloped computer plays fast and loose with our strategic weapons ; macho-talking morons of both the military and civilian stripe manage through ignorance and bullheadedness to bring the world to the brink of nuclear disaster . Some fun . These premises belong , of course , to this summer ' s hit movie " Wargames , " which contrives its considerable appeal by catering to a broad spectrum of phobias . It is a fun flick , but the hooks by which it draws us were waiting there in our worst fears . It operates on several levels of terror , from the monumental to the trivial : The grandest , and the most popular , is the prospect of sponging up gamma rays in an atomic Armageddon . Down the scale a bit , the spectacle of a monomaniacally intelligent machine , pre-empting our prerogatives and wasting everybody , titillates the technophobes among us , and satisfies our worst suspicions about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there ' s the notion that this whole chain reaction of terror is triggered by a kid seeking video thrills ; this allows those with a hatchet- faced selectman in the back of their minds to remonstrate : " See what happens when kids play these damn computer games ? " Playing as it does to our worst fears , the movie inexorably raises the question " Can this really happen ? " In many ways , it looks plausible enough - the mix of technology and stupidity seems about right . But how likely is it really that an amock-running war-game simulation could set us on the path to Armageddon ? As it happens we do have a line on that particular eventuality and we can fix its likelihood at 100 percent . In an incident a few years back , which offers a loose precedent for the film ' s central premise , a NORAD war game jumped the fence and triggered a nuclear alert . The error was short-lived and was caught almost instantly by safeguard procedures , but everybody got a mite twitchety . We were saved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because the situation involved a run-of-the-mill error occurring under normal operating conditions . But what would be the outcome were we faced with events such as those depicted in the movie ? Well , let ' s examine the key events , one by one as they unfold , and see just how likely they might be . Key Event number 1 : This really is a key event . A scene depicting a missile-launch drill in an underground control bunker indicates that mere humans can ' t be reliably expected to turn the key that will unlock thermonuclear destruction for half the globe . ( The other half . ) Even under orders . Instead of drawing the obvious conclusion from that state of affairs , the powers-that-be decide toreplace the humans in the bunker with a computer- linked switch panel under direct control of the President . This is a rather silly premise ( Why should a President be more gung-ho about extinguishing all earthly life than a military officer ? He has votes to consider , after all , not mere orders . ) But it sets up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us early on . It also turns out to be necessary later , in order to give the rank-pulling computer direct access to the launch controls . It ' s contrived , on a couple of levels at once . Ignore this event . Key Event number 2 : This scene establishes the teenage hero , David , as a computer-game junkie . He ' s zapping things all over the screen of an arcade machine , then , realizing that he ' s about to be late for class , he turns the game over to another kid and runs off . This is faulty premise number two . Have you ever seen a kid leave a video game unfinished ? Key Event number 3 : David , in the company of his budding romantic interest , Jennifer , establishes himself to us as a computer hacker par excellence . With the assistance of his home computer system and a dial-up modem he accesses the computer at his school ( via a pirated password ) and alters his grades , then monkeys around with a few airline reservations , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the security of a computer-game company for a little contraband zapping , he sets up an autodialer to call every phone number in the company ' s locality until it gets a data line , which presumably will be the company ' s computer . Clever . And up until this point all of the hacking he does is perfectly feasible ; given his equipment and inside information , its all very reasonable . ( The only unreasonable thing is the phone bill his parents will get next month , what with the several thousand autodialed long- distance calls - but we see later in the flick that the kid is also a telephone jock ; so maybe he ' s got that beat , too . ) Key Event number 4 : Unbeknownst to the kid , his auto dialing lashup has snagged a NORAD access line . He thinks it ' s the computer- games company . He takes a few shots at logging on through the system , failing to come up with a legitimate password , then decides to take a look at a system-file directory , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , even if he can ' t get at it yet . Prompted to list " games , " the system comes back with a raft of titles , all the way from Blackjack to GLOBAL THERMONUCLEAR WAR . Gulp . Here ' s where we start to get into global implausability . Even discounting the impossibility that the NORAD system builders would permit information access to the heart of the nation ' s defense through an open phone line , and what ' s more , on the say-so of a single password , there are several credibility strains . First of all , military computer systems are the most paranoid creatures in existence . They ' re built that way . To the designers of such a system , a repeated erroneous attempt to log on is never attributable to a befuddled but legitimate user - it ' s enemy action . None of the military computer systems responsible for national securityallow leisurely stabs at demolishing their security . You get an extremely limited number of chances - very often , one - before it boots you off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the maximum case , it also hollers " Wolf ! " and before you know it , you ' re up to your toggles in MPs . The second major thing wrong is that the system allows the kid to examine its directory without his even being logged on . This is simply not done . If the builders of the real NORAD system were capable of such a shamefully elementary faux pas , we ' d all have been glowing cinders long before now . The system would be a crock , not only from the security standpoint but from the operational one as well . The whole security-breach premise blows up here . It can ' t happen that waybecause things aren ' t built that way . From this point on , I just relaxed and started having a good time with the movie . If you want to dismiss the rest of the flick as fantasy , this is the place to start . But we can go a little further if you really need reassurance . Key event number 5 : Kid , obsessed with getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system programmers sometimes leave " back doors " into systems they build - access methods that bypass the normal routines . This is legit . In fact , it ' s one of the milder forms of mischief that system programmers indulge in . Key event number 6 : Through an entertaining grind of clever detective work , kid figures out who the game ' s programmer must have been , and by dint of examining the public record of the programmer ' s life for words that may have been meaningful to him , discovers a workable password . Hmmm . Could be , but it falls into the " had we but world enough and time " category . Furthermore , it ' s mighty hard to believe that , through all of this kid ' s dozens of password failures , someone monitoring system status at NORAD hasn ' t noticed an access- ignorant user on an open line continually being blown off , and taken action . Key events numbers 7 to number 70 or so : From here on in , things just get very murky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wayward computer , let ' s deal with those implausibilities in an a la carte list . The system the kid has succeeded in accessing is not the main defense system , but a computer dedicated to running war-game simulations unceasingly . How this machine manages to co-opt the entire defense electronics apparatus is never made clear , except that it appears to know what it ' s doing , thanks to its intelligence . Suffice it to say that there ' s no way a computer can behave as this Joshua does . An attempt is made very early to excuse its apparent sentience , by having a character note that the machine has been programmed that way . It shortly becomes clear that if that ' s the case , the device has been programmed to lead a completely autonomous life - as serious a contradiction in terms as you can get . In short , there ' s nothing like this machine on the face of the earth - it is possessed of real intelligence , and computers aren ' t . But even if we accepted the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ d still have credibility problems . Do you think that the brass hats would let an experimental artificial-intelligence machine anywhere near a necessarily lockstep defense-computer system ? They don ' t even let human intelligence get that close . As for the movie ' s special effects , let me launch a massive retaliatory gripe here . I hate it when they depict a strain on system capacity by making computer terminals blow up , as though a data line were a high-pressure hose or something . There ' s not much realistic stuff here , but it ' s plenty of fun . The movie plays on various paranoias and then tacks on a moral - however , a valuable moral , no matter how many technological contortions they had to twist through to get to it . But there ' s something of a copout in it . The crazed computer is tamed , but notice that no one moves to disassemble NORAD after the computer- posed threat is over . The brass hats are sadder and wiser , not about the futility of nuclear war , but about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
