Opponents of arms-control talks have long justified their skepticism by citing Moscow 's long-standing refusal to allow arms inspectors on Soviet soil . Last week the Soviets took a small step toward spiking that criticism . At a ceremony in Vienna , the U.S.S.R. signed an agreement that for the first time allows the U.N.-sponsored International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) to inspect carefully selected parts of Moscow 's civilian nuclear industry . Said Soviet Diplomat Vladimir Petrovsky at the signing : " On the eve of U.S.-Soviet talks in Geneva , we feel it is necessary to create a favorable atmosphere . " <P> The agreement is an adjunct to the 1970 nonproliferation treaty , designed to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons . More than 90 other nations have similar arrangements with the IAEA , including the U.S. , which signed an inspection agreement in 1980 . Moscow did not agree to the idea in principle until 1982 , and subsequent negotiations on the actual terms of the new document took 16 months . How important a concession is the accord ? That may depend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the latest , advanced civilian nuclear plants , or merely old , outdated ones .
