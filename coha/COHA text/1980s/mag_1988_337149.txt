Of the plays that tower over American drama  --  Thornton Wilder 's Our Town , Tennessee Williams ' The Glass Menagerie , Arthur Miller 's Death of a Salesman and Eugene O'Neill 's Long Day 's Journey into Night  --  Our Town is at once the most universally familiar and the most widely misunderstood . Audiences tend to recall Wilder 's glimpse of small-town , turn-of-the-century New Hampshire as sweet , sentimental , nostalgic and funny . It was all those things . But it was also  --  and remains , 50 years after its first public performances in January 1938  --  groundbreakingly unconventional in form and chafingly unsettling in its view of human nature . More than any other play in American literature , Our Town opened the minds of the mainstream to nonliteral ways of telling a story . Unlike the domestic tragedy of Williams and Miller and O'Neill , Our Town took the sweeping view that a misspent life is not a pitiable exception but a lamentable norm . Life , Wilder argued , is almost too precious to be wasted on the living , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's prickly virtues are recaptured in a spare staging by Director Arvin Brown at New Haven , Conn. ' s , Long Wharf Theater . Hal Holbrook stars in the role Wilder sometimes enacted himself , as the Stage Manager or narrator of this funny valentine to the squandered joys of everyday life . Scoffing , moments after he enters , at those who feel a need for scenery , Holbrook commands the lowering of a couple of trellises halfheartedly entwined with flowers ; an instant later , they are hauled back up out of sight . From then on , the actors proceed without props or sets save for a couple of platforms , a few chairs and some suspended window frames . <P> A few words , a mimed gesture , perhaps some sound effects ( a boy blowing a train whistle , a man whinnying like a horse ) suffice to define the space and locate the scene . With a minimum of identifying costume , actors shift character : when the young lovers ( Daniel Nathan Spector and Louise Roberts ) have a first tentative date at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serves them . As Wilder points up through risible " lectures " about this archetypal town 's economy , politics , demographics and even geology , what matters about its people is not the naturalistic detail but the philosophic essence . <P> In defiance of the " rules " of drama , Wilder kills off half a dozen characters without offering even one juicy onstage death scene , and the mourners are limited to one wordless gesture and one choked cry . Although the play appears to celebrate the tender bonds of family and community , the beauty of human connection is all but unseen : real self-awareness comes in monologue or in rueful exchanges among the shades of characters already dead . In the climax , a young woman who has died in childbirth revisits earth on the day of her twelfth birthday , only to find that her mother can not " see " her . That is , not only is the mother unable to envision the ghost of her daughter 's future self but , for all her maternal devotion , she is so caught up in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actual girl who stands yearning for it . That moment underlines why Wilder chose his austere narrative form . It too demands that people pay attention rather than be guided by the obvious . It sends them into the night having had to stop and look and listen .
