Sound off The octagon stop signs used to control traffic are not all painted the same on the rear side . Some are painted aluminum , which is very indistinguishable , others are gray , and some are painted red . Many times , in coining to an intersection , one is not always aware of whether crossing traffic is controlled by a stop sign or not . Many times it is difficult to observe what the traffic control pattern is , particularly at night . I would like to suggest that all stop signs be painted on the rear with reflective red .
