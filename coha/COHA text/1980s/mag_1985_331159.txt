" Canada is open and ready for business . " With those words , Prime Minister Brian Mulroney underscored his government 's commitment to loosening trade restrictions last week in the third of TIME 's Distinguished Speakers Program series . The forum was inaugurated by President Reagan in February 1984 at his alma mater , Eureka College in Eureka , Ill. , and followed last December with an address by former Democratic Vice Presidential Nominee Geraldine Ferraro at the University of Wisconsin at Madison . Speaking at the University of Chicago , Mulroney used the occasion to drive home his view that protectionist trade policies lead only to isolation in international politics . Said he : " I know that President Reagan shares this view . He is a fair trader , and I echo his words : ' Protectionism is destructionism . ' All who believe in the benefits of a more open world trading system must take a stand . " <P> The Prime Minister selected the University of Chicago to deliver his remarks , he said , in order to " reach deep into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mulroney reported that Canada 's economic renewal is well under way . " All the indicators  --  the gross national product forecasts , interest rates , inflation , housing starts , employment , capital investment  --  are improving , in some cases a wee bit better than the U.S , " he said . " Most important , confidence is being rebuilt . " To put its house in order , Mulroney reiterated , his government is firmly committed to reducing its $25.8 billion budget deficit . He recommended that the U.S. , like Canada , " put your nose to the grindstone and pay down your debt . " <P> - Warming to his theme of " the mutual danger of protectionism , " he noted that U.S.-Canada trade last year totaled nearly $150 billion , the largest volume between any two nations in the world . One of three Canadian jobs depends on exports , he noted , and the U.S. buys three-quarters of his country 's exports . " The imperative for Canada is not just more multilateral arrangements , " said Mulroney , " but stability in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secure access to ( the U.S. ) market , while recognizing that the removal of barriers opens trade in both directions . It is not a one-way street . " <P> The Ottawa government has reversed the traditional Canadian protectionist stance in favor of freer trade , Mulroney said , in part because of the challenge posed by Canada 's European and Asian competitors . " Maybe it wo n't work , " he observed . " Maybe it will turn out that protectionist sentiment is too strong . Free trade is not without its perils . But liberalized trade brings more wealth , not less , and a stronger economy will help guarantee the political sovereignty of Canada . " <P> At the same time , however , Mulroney declared that Canada must continue to maintain a cultural identity separate from that of the U.S. " Our system of social programs , our commitment as Canadians to fight regional disparities , our unique cultural identity , our special linguistic character  --  these are the essence of Canada , " he said . " You will have to understand that what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life as political sovereignty . " To make sure that the message got through , and to see that it made news in Quebec as well as in the English-speaking provinces of Canada , Mulroney repeated it in French .
