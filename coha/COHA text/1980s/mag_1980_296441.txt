A sad chronicle of surprises and miscalculations <P> The virtual annexation of Afghanistan by the Soviet Union represents not only a strategic setback for the U.S. but a potential political liability for Jimmy Carter as well . TIME Diplomatic Correspondent Strobe Talbott examines the historical background of the crisis : <P> <P> The question " Who lost Afghanistan ? " is probably inevitable in the presidential campaign , if only because it echoes last year 's refrains of " Who lost Iran ? " and " Who lost Nicaragua ? " The temptation to blame Jimmy Carter is understandable-and , for his critics , irresistible . After all , even though his predecessors had unwittingly contributed to the leftward drift of the Kabul government , it was during Carter 's watch-and partly because of his misjudgments-that Afghanistan finally slipped from its traditional neutrality into the Soviet orbit . <P> But Afghanistan , unlike Iran and Nicaragua , was never really " ours " to lose . The British raj stopped at the Afghan border , and so did the post-World War II Pax Americana . In 1955 John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Central Treaty Organization ( CENTO ) as part of a global network of anti-Soviet alliances . In effect , Dulles was drawing a line in the dust that the Soviets dared not step across lest they incur the thermonuclear wrath of the West . That line ran along the northern frontiers of Turkey , Iran and Pakistan , which were all members of CENTO . In keeping with Afghanistan 's policy of nonalignment , it remained beyond the American " security perimeter " and was therefore vulnerable to its giant neighbor . <P> U.S policymakers left Afghanistan largely out of their geopolitical calculations , implicitly conceding it to the Soviet sphere of influence . When Henry Kissinger stopped off in Kabul to show the flag for a few hours in 1974 , he spent almost as much time watching buzkashi , a primitive and violent form of polo , as he did talking business with President Mohammed Daoud . Says a veteran of the Nixon and Ford Administrations : " We had no illusions that the Afghans would or could defy Moscow . They were more Finlandized than the Finns . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overthrew Daoud in April 1978 surprised the Soviets as much as it did the Americans . Western intelligence has not been able to find Russian fingerprints on the scene of " the April revolution , " but the Soviets wasted no time in placing advisers in all the important ministries and down to the company level in the armed forces . <P> The Carter Administration under reacted . Soviet aggressiveness in Afghanistan would be bad news for detente and for U.S. peace initiatives in the Middle East . Also , in its eagerness to make friends in the Third World , the Administration tended to give the benefit of the doubt to leftists who also seemed to be nationalists . Pakistan 's strongman , Mohammed Zia ul-Haq , warned that a Marxist government in Kabul , supported by the Soviets , had gravely upset the balance of power in the region . " The Russians are now at the Khyber Pass , " Zia told TIME in September 1978-but that was simply not a message Washington wanted to hear .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
