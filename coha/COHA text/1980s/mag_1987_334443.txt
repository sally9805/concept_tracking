Near the end of each week Senior Writer George Church pursues a late-evening ritual . Up and down , up and down , Church slowly paces the corridor of the Nation section in his stocking feet , puzzling out his story , drawing together elements from a welter of reportage and weaving those parts into the firm , seamless narratives that have made his writing almost legendary at TIME . Every so often on these jaunts a thoughtful grunt escapes his lips and he smiles in satisfaction . He then heads quickly back to his computer terminal to tap out the results of his stroll in paragraphs of carefully linked fact and perception . " Working with George , " says Reporter-Researcher Katherine Mihok , who has done so on many occasions , including last week , " is like being in on the Creation . " <P> , For this week 's issue , Church wrote the lead story in our discussion of the Tower commission 's findings . It is his 77th cover story in 18 years at TIME . " The Iran-contra affair is more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in , " says Church . " This will be the fifth cover related to the controversy that I 've done in four months . " In terms of writing , it presents a growing problem . " There is by now a very long and complicated public record that you must cite to put the new developments in context , " says Church . " The question is where to draw the line . " But Church believes the hardships " are far overshadowed by the excitement that goes with the top story in the country . " Says he : " It 's like pitching in the World Series . " <P> In our Washington bureau , the excitement over the developing story was palpable . Staffers Brian Doyle and Neang Seng battled through a thicket of reporters and TV cameramen to stuff a pile of commission reports into knapsacks as soon as the copies were released at the White House Press Office on Thursday morning . Meanwhile , Correspondents Barrett Seaman and David Beckwith prepared to analyze the 288-page report as the Tower commission press conference unfolded . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Donald Regan . Correspondents Hays Gorey and Michael Duffy scoured Congress for reactions . Pentagon Correspondent Bruce van Voorst investigated CIA involvement . And Correspondents Alessandra Stanley and Ricardo Chavira concentrated on Lieut . Colonel Oliver North and the contra connection . " With all the details required for my stories , " says Church from his New York City office , " I often wonder how the bureau ever manages to come up with the stuff we need . " Then he grins . " But , you know , they always do . "
