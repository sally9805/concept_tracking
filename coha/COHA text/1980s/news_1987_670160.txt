BELMONT , Calif.  --  Borland International Inc. said it agreed to acquire closely held Ansa Software in a transaction that would pair two of the personal computer industry ' s best known entrepreneurs . The proposed merger , in a stock swap valued at about $38 million , would team Philippe Kahn , a flamboyant former mathematics teacher from France who is the founder , chairman and president of Borland , with Benjamin Rosen , Ansa ' s chairman and the venture capitalist who engineered such computer-industry success stories as Lotus Development Corp. and Compaq Computer Corp . Borland , based in Scotts Valley , Calif. , has been one of the fastest-growing personal computer software companies , selling more than two million copies of its programs in the past three years . The company , with shares publicly traded on the London Stock Exchange , sells some of the most popular computer language programs that professional programmers use on personal computers . Borland also is known for its aggressive pricing , with only a few programs selling for more than $100 . Lately , however , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as word processing and database management . For the fiscal year ended March 31 , Borland had sales of $29. 2 million , and pre-tax profit of $4. 7 million ; after-tax results weren ' t available .

Until now , Borland ' s sales and marketing has been what Mr. Kahn called " a telemarketing-like operation . " Now , he said , " We ' ll have a polished corporate sales force selling both Borland and Ansa products . " Mr. Posner and Mr. Rosen , Ansa ' s chairman , also will join Borland ' s board , increasing it to six members . Asked whether he planned to take an active role at Borland , Mr. Rosen said , " We don ' t accept board positions unless we intend to participate actively .

Mr. Rosen said despite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pride in its no-frills approach to business , while Ansa projects a more polished and formal image  --  the combination " makes sense .

Both Mr. Kahn and Mr. Rosen said Borland ' s biggest opportunity for growth will come in the next 18 months , as software companies scramble to be the first to come out with products that take advantage of Microsoft Corp. ' s OS/2 high-performance operating system for advanced personal computers . That operating system will enable computer users to run several programs at once and run much more complicated and graphically oriented software . " In the confusion there is opportunity , " Mr. Kahn said . Credit : Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal
