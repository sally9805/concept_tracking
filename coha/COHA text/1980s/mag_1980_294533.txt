Boeing captures the cruise missile contract and dominates world aviation <P> It was the biggest single Air Force contract since the Viet Nam War , and it is almost certain to be remembered as the arms deal that propelled the U.S. into the weapons-bristling decade of the 1980s . The prize was the $4 billion air-launched , cruise missile system that the U.S. is counting on to maintain a strategic edge over the Soviet Union for much of the remainder of the 20th century . The victor , not unexpectedly , was the Boeing Co. of Seattle , one of the nation 's most successful corporations . <P> Boeing : builder of strategic bombers , ballistic missiles and jumbo jets . Boeing : the nation 's 29th largest industrial company , but a firm with a plain-talking chairman of the board , Thornton ( " T " ) Wilson , who drives unpretentiously around Seattle in a Honda instead of the company limousine . Boeing : the best planemaker in the world today , eclipsing all competition in the civilian aircraft business . <P> The fight for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the 20 test flights produced malfunctions and failures for the competing designs of both companies ( see box ) . But in the end , there was very little surprise that the contract went to Boeing . <P> In the 64 years since its founding as the Pacific Aero Products Co. , the Seattle planemaker has developed and nurtured a reputation for innovation , reliability and plain downright engineering excellence that is unmatched in the industry . Indeed , in an age when much of American business seems to have slipped into a search for quick profits and is marked by shoddy workmanship , the 104,000 engineers , designers , draftsmen , machinists , executives and salesmen of Boeing stand out as proof that , over the long haul , the only lasting standard of value in any market is quality itself . Said Air Force Secretary Hans Mark of the Pentagon 's decision to award the cruise contract to Boeing : " Both contractors turned in good products . The differences between the two designs were small , but they were significant enough to make a good , firm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> The contract calls for 3,418 of the 20-ft. 9-in. missiles to be delivered to the Air Force between now and 1989 . Boeing will produce 225 of the weapons , at a cost of $141 million , during the current fiscal year , and output will be boosted to 480 during fiscal 1981 . At least half of the $4 billion deal will go to about two dozen other defense contractors to provide parts and equipment . The Pentagon could ultimately decide to invite General Dynamics or other competitors to use Boeing 's own design and build at least some of the missiles . <P> The perhaps $2 billion in increased revenues that the company is expected to earn as the project 's overseer and prime contractor comes at a time when the firm is already in an updraft of high-flying riches . From $5.5 billion in 1978 , Boeing 's sales climbed 49% in 1979 to a stunning $8.1 billion . Profits rose proportionately even more , to $505 million , an increase of 57% over the previous year . In the past two weeks alone Boeing has sold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ansett in Australia , Cathay Pacific in Hong Kong and Western in Los Angeles .
