HEARTSOUNDS by Martha Weinman Lear <P> Simon &; Schuster ; 413 pages ; $12.95 <P> Anyone who has been seriously ill often develops mixed feelings about general practitioners and practitioners in general . Those sentiments have produced a burgeoning nonfiction genre : the antimedical medical book . Last season 's outstanding instance was Norman Cousins ' Anatomy of an Illness ( Norton ; $9.95 ) . More in elation than in anger , the former editor of the Saturday Review recounted his battle against a disease of the spinal tissue that physicians had pronounced irreversible . Cousins ignored them . If stress and other negative emotions could trigger illness , he reasoned , positive emotions might restore health . The patient treated himself medically with ascorbic acid and emotionally with laughter-inducing joke books and reruns of Marx brothers movies . Not exactly what the doctor ordered , but it worked . <P> The story of Cousins ' recovery became a surprise bestseller-a surprise , that is , to the medical establishment . It should have known better .

Unlike Cousins ' account , it has no upbeat conclusion about the body 's ability to heal itself . Sorrow unfolds from the book 's opening line : " He awoke at 7 a.m. with pain in his chest . " <P> He is Hal Lear , Martha 's husband , a physician and a man of intelligence and sensitivity . The pain that woke him was the onset of his first heart attack . Before Dr. Lear 's death four years later , he was to suffer every indignity open to victims of cardiac disease . Worse , as a doctor he understood exactly what was happening to him , so that he was not even granted the anesthesia of ignorance . <P> With unblinking candor , Martha Lear records every agony , every tantrum , every embarrassment experienced by a man whose body has begun the process of betrayal . No one is spared , least of all the author . She recalls her resentment of the illness that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ache for him but I resent him as well , this sick , sunken man ... The intensity of the anger that hovers here , beneath what I take to be love , is frightening . I understand the wretched banality of such an anger as this . . . yet it shames and appalls me . " <P> That anger is not directed solely at Hal and his illness . The author 's finest fury is saved for medical institutions . Norman Cousins was ironic : " A hospital is no place for a person who is seriously ill . " Martha Lear is splenetic : " The social atrocities committed by the staff ! " she recalls of Hal 's initial hospital admission . " It was as though , by the simple act of signing in , patients forfeited the right to be treated with respect . " Her husband reinforces her feelings . <P> " Where else , " he asks , " would you tolerate such rotten service for $185.80 a day ? "             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
