Lightning has struck stodgy old American Brands . In recent days , shares of the consumer products company have run up and down erratically as traders  --  not for the first time  --  laid bets on an imminent takeover or a management buyout . The outcome is uncertain , but the feverish surge in the shares shows how quickly a company can get caught up in an investment fashion , in this case involving brand-name products . While some analysts think American Brands is safe from predators for now , companies in such a situation sometimes are forced to take defensive actions that they never intended . In recent years , takeovers of cookie companies and cough-drop makers have highlighted the value of brand-name products . Arbitragers only recently discovered the brands of American Brands , which include Lucky Strike cigarettes , Jim Beam bourbon , Sunshine cookies and Swingline staplers . But soon after they did so , the company ' s shares were " in play " and merger speculation was rife . American Brands shares , trading at only about 65 in January , hit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yesterday to close at 103 1/4 , up 3/4 . Problem is , the stock has become very expensive , skeptics say , and now may be less appealing to potential buyers . The big attraction of consumer stocks is their strong cash flows . Yet American Brands currently trades at around 11 times its 1986 cash flow , versus a multiple of only six or seven for industry leaders Philip Morris and RJR Nabisco , says analyst Arthur Kirsch of Drexel Burnham Lambert . American Brands ' premium is the more remarkable considering its stagnant profits in recent years . The industry leaders ' profits have grown at a fast clip . To " play " American Brands ' stock now , says the head trader of an aggressive money management concern , " you ' d better be sure something is going to happen . " He isn ' t playing . Some money managers think acquisition-minded Revlon was sniffing at American Brands , but may have retreated . Revlon won ' t comment . Earlier talk that Seagram , Unilever or B.A.T Industries might be buyers seems to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to escape unwelcome courtiers , will go private , perhaps with assistance from Kohlberg Kravis Roberts . Neither party would comment , but traders say the buyout price could be $115 to $120 a share , or roughly $6. 5 billion . If nothing else , some traders say , American Brands might try to keep its stock expensive by buying some of its shares or spinning off some operations to holders . Management owns much less than 1% of the stock , so the company could be vulnerable to a hostile bid . How did American Brands escape notice for so long , despite the revival of interest in tobacco stocks ? Its performance was lackluster . The U.S. market share of its Lucky Strike , Pall Mall , Carlton and Tareyton cigarettes  --  which generate almost half its operating profit  --  has slipped to about 8% from 14% in 1975 , says Allan Kaplan , analyst at Merrill Lynch . But American Brands began to be noticed earlier this year . At the time , its shares were lagging other tobacco stocks . The company also has several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It has little debt and strong cash flow , which are important to an acquirer that must borrow the purchase price . If American Brands cut capital spending , says one New York money manager , almost $10 a share of cash flow would be available to pay interest on a takeover loan of , say , $120 a share . Some of the company ' s assets could be sold quickly to repay part of the loan , she adds . American Brands ' British tobacco business , maker of Benson &; Hedges and Silk Cut , is the second largest in the United Kingdom and could be sold profitably , analysts say . Its two life insurance units are poised for growth and could be hot properties , they add . And the company ' s big portfolio of consumer products is invaluable , they say , because launching new brands is costly . Despite its stodgy image , American Brands has done a better job of diversifying its business than some other tobacco companies , says Jim Gipson of Pacific Financial Research . The money manager bought American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last of his holdings Wednesday at a big profit . Selling could be a smart move , some analysts say . Anyone who wanted to bid for American Brands , says Bob Raiff of Cyrus J. Lawrence , could have done so when it was cheaper . With the stock at current prices , he adds , " management shouldn ' t feel pressure to do any radical restructuring.
