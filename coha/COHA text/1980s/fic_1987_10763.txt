cabinets for the heated flasks . He filled them , slowly , and Aliste swaggered across the bar to collect them , still smiling . " What the hell 's going on ? " That was one of the other actors who had been sitting in the bar , her voice a little blurred from the drinks she had had . Aliste handed the bottles to the man with the Brandr ribbons and turned to face the questioner , clearly savoring her moment . " Fen Erling 's fighting to clear his name , after the Halex woman called him a murderer . " " Ask where , " Rehur said , to the minne . Aliste had to be pars ' an  --  she could n't be an actor unless she were  --  but he did n't want to give her the chance to refuse him . Ume-Kai shook his head , but then someone else shouted , " Where ? " Aliste shook her head with a richly artificial laugh . Rehur 's hand closed around the mug of wine , but Ume-Kai caught his wrist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ezar 's listening , ready to call the cops on us . But come along , if you want . " The stranger put his arm around her shoulders , drawing her gently out of the bar before she could say anything more . Aliste looked back over his arm , laughing again , as the door swung closed behind them . " Damn it , Ume , " Rehur began , but the minne shook his head . " I know where it has to be , there 's no other place they can fight . Do we call the cops ? " Rehur hesitated . The police force in Destiny was a minor force at best , trained to guard the green gates and to prevent burglary if they could . They had already proved their inability to handle the new street violence the year before , when a feud-related riot killed six people . More than that , most of them were Ingvarrs , of the Halex Kinship , and to call them in would only contribute to the problem . " I do n't know , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , decisively , " No . No , Ume , it 'd only make things worse . " He pushed himself to his feet , reaching for the light overtunic slung across the back of his chair . " Just tell me where , all right ? " Ume-Kai started to protest , then shook his head . " I 'll take you there . " The sunlight had faded to the unnatural twilight of first hour of Eclipse , and there was a breath of frost in the air . Rehur shivered , hugging the knitted overtunic around himself , and wondered if it wasp111only the wind that chilled him . He was dressed only for the relative warmth of the Day , but the temperature could not have dropped that quickly . He shuddered again , and pulled thin gloves from his pockets . " This way , " Ume-Kai said . In the dead light , his grey clothes , cap , long scarf , tunic , trousers , were blurred and indistinct , rendering him almost invisible against the grey-brown walls of the surrounding buildings . Only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the disembodied projections of the puppet stage . " This way , " he said again , impatiently , and Rehur followed . This was not a part of the Necropolis he knew well , a section given over to cross-talk theaters like the Cockaigne , and to small , cheap bars and blocks of cheaper flats . Belit would know it better , he thought , would have played in some of the halls , and then was annoyedat the irrelevant memory . The bars and cabaret theaters were closed , of course , their windows tightly shuttered , doors blocked by durable steel grates . The light was fading all around them ; here and there , a streetlight struggled to come on . A few minutes later , Ume-Kai turned off the main street into a maze of alleys lit only by old-fashioned ball lights set above the buildings ' doors . They gave little coverage , and Rehur was careful to stay close behind the minne as they threaded their way through the unmetalled roads . The alleys were very quiet  --  people tended to spend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but then Rehur heard a sudden rush of voices . He stopped short , listening , and the sound was cut off as abruptly as it had appeared . " Ume ? " he began , and the minne nodded . " I heard . That 's where we 're going . " Ume-Kai turned a final corner and stopped short , putting out a hand to stop the younger actor . " Do you have any money ? " " Some , " Rehur answered , glancing warily around . They were in a dead-end alley , unlit except for the ball light above the grated door of the building at the far end of the street . To either side , the buildings  --  warehouses , perhaps , or the cheapest tenements  --  showed windowlesswalls for the first two stories , and mean , grated slits for the story above that . " Give it to me . " " Why ? " Rehur asked , but reached obediently into his trousers pocket.  | " We 'll have to pay to get in , and probably a lot , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Rehur passed him the folded sheaf of banknotes , wishing it were larger . He would figure out how to pay the rent , how to eat later , he thought . Right now it was more important to find out what was happening to Ixora . Tucking the money into the palm of his glove , Ume-Kai advanced on the end building , Rehur following close behind . As they approached the barred door , Rehur could see steps leading down to one side , to a second , sunken door . The lower door had no grate , and a modern bar light burned above it , filling the landing well with harsh brilliance . Ume-Kai stepped down into it without hesitation , and Rehur followed , blinking . There was a knocker set above the lock-plate , and Urne-Kai pressed it . It made no sound in the stairwell , but they could hear , faintly , its chimes echoing somewhere inside the building . The door opened almost before the knocker stopped sounding , and a hairless head appeared in the opening . " Sorry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delivery , it 's upstairs . " He started to close the door , but Ume-Kai slipped the folded notes out of the palm of his glove . " We 're here for the fun , " he said , in an expressionless voice . " Ah . " The bald man reversed the door 's swing instantly . " You 're late . " Ume-Kai shrugged , and held out the money . The bald man took it , and waved them both inside . He closed the door behind them just as a wave of shouting rolled along the white-painted corridor . " You know the way ? " " Yes , " Ume-Kai said , in the same toneless voice . " Right , " the bald man said , and settled himself again in the batteredchair that stood just inside the door . " Come on , " Ume-Kai said , and put his hand on the younger actor 's shoulder . Rehur shivered at the touch , but did as he was told . The corridors were brightly lit , freshly painted , but the air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he caught the sharp scent of urine . " What is this place ? " he said at last , when he was sure they were out of earshot of the man guarding the door . " Legally , it 's a gym , " Ume-Kai answered . The corners of his mouthp113drew downward in distaste . " But they hire out for a lot of things  --  duels , blood sport , whatever . " " " How come you know so much about it ? " Rehur asked , and wished he had n't . The minne 's face contorted . Then he mastered his expression , and said coldly , " You did nureba . I was minne ' from the time I turned fourteen . " He gave the word the inflection that changed the meaning from a kind of actor to transvestite prostitute , and Rehur winced . With an effort , Ume-Kai managed a lopsided smile . " I was born dead , Rehur . My mother was a ghost , and a poor one . I had to do some-thing . " Rehur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't anything . They walked on in silence . A few meters farther on , the corridorended in an abrupt right turn . Rehur saw the other actor square his shoulders , and braced himself to meet whatever lay around the corner . The shouting , which had been building as they came down the corridor , rose to a sudden climax as they turned the corner . Rehur flinched , and almost stumbled into the table set to block half the corridor . A nondescript man , heavily muscled for an Oresteian , sat behind it . " " Let 's see your tickets , friends , " he said . Ume-Kai shook his head . " We paid at the door , friend . " He gave that word a twist , too , and the muscle-man frowned . " Too bad , friend , you pay here . " " If I pay again , " Ume-Kai said deliberately , " you 'll see yourself on the Cockaigne stage . Do I make myself clear ? " The muscle-man shrugged . " Ca n't blame me for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Ume-Kai smiled thinly , and stepped past the table . Rehur followed before the muscle-man could change his mind . They ducked through a final , low doorway into darkness . Rehur hesitated , half-blind in the sudden dark , and Ume-Kai caught his hand , drawing him away from the door . After a moment , the younger man 's sight cleared . They stood at the back of a low-ceilinged gallery , looking through a series of low arches into an orange-lit central space . Each of the arches was packed with bodies , making it impossible to see what lay beyond . The smell of urine was stronger here , and Rehur made a face , avoiding the frequent puddles . Ume-Kai leaned close , his lips almost against the other 's ear . " Thep114fighting 's in the pit , " he said . " We want your Family 's box-this way . " Box ? " Rehur asked , in half-hysterical disbelief , but Ume-Kai was already pulling him toward the far end of the gallery . Rehur stumbled after him , catching only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them seemed to be para anin , or at least if they were dead , their ghostmarks were hidden beneath hoods and pulled-down caps . Most were shabbily dressed , but not all of them ; he caught sight of at least one young woman wearing a pin in the shape of the Orillonseaflower , recognized another young man 's five-hundred-kip coat . Then they were pushing their way through the crowd that clogged the central arch , and Rehur recognized familiar faces , Halex faces , among the crowd . They recognized him , too , but could not be seen to see a ghost . Ume-Kai seemed to be searching for something , swearing to himself as he pushed past people . Rehur struggled after him , keeping a tight hold on the loose fabric of the minne 's over-tunic . Then , at the very front of the archway , silhouetted against the orange light of the pit , he saw a cloaked figure , saw too the light reflecting from the medium 's badge swinging at its collar . " Maturin ? " In the same instant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ume-Kai swung to face him . " Your medium ? " " Not Trey , but yes , a medium . " " Where ? " Rehur pointed to the cloaked shape . " There . " " Thank God , " " Ume-Kai said , and began pushing through the crowd again . For once , the ghostmarks worked to their advantage . Angry spectators , turning to see who was shoving , fell back at the sight of the white-marked foreheads , and let them pass . Rehur took savage pleasure in elbowing his own kinsmen and watching their faces change from annoyance to mute , wooden outrage at his presence . And then they had reached the mouth of the archway , and UmeKaireached to touch the medium 's shoulder . The figure turned , frowning , and Rehur recognized Emerant Ansson , who handled much of the Kinship 's business in Destiny . The medium 's frown deepened as she saw Ume-Kai , then eased as she saw Rehur standing behind the minne . She turned so that her back was against the side of thep115archway , pressing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in beside her . " What can I do for you ? " she asked , raising her voice to be heard over the rumbling of the crowd . Rehur barely heard the question . For the first time , he had a clear view down into the pit , and the sight held him mesmerized . The pit was just that , an oval hole perhaps thirteen or fourteen meters long and five or six meters wide . The lip of the archway was a little more than two meters from the sanded floor , dyed bright orange by the glow of the heating lamps suspended from the ceiling . In the pit itself , two knots of people clustered around a figure at each end of the oval . Each group carried a weighted driver 's whip , but it was some seconds before Rehur recognized Ixora at the center of the left-hand group . " Tell us what happened , Medium , " Ume-Kai said . " You do n't know ? " Emerant bit off her own question , glancing from one to the other . Rehur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knitted tunic and loose shirt until she stood bare-armed , undervest defining her tiny breasts . " No , " he said . Emerant drew a deep breath , obviously searching for the most economicalway to tell the story . " " Fen Erling challenged Ixora , for calling him liar and murderer , " she said , after a moment 's thought . " That gave her choice of weapons , which is why it 's whips . She ca n't kill him too easily that way . So we 're here . " " Why did n't she just refuse ? " Rehur asked . Emerant gave him a wry half smile , and did n't answer . Swearing , Rehur turned back to the pit . Ume-Kai wrapped one long hand around the other actor 's arm to steady him , but Rehur barely felt that fierce grip . They all knew why Ixora had responded to the challenge : to have refused would have been to admit a mistake , to say she had not meant her accusation , and , for better or for worse , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rehur thought , she had the sense to choose half-lethal weapons . The seconds would have to step in before someone was killed . " Why did n't she just stay out of sight ? " Ume-Kai asked . " If this Fen could n't find her to challenge her . . . . " Emerant sighed , working her hands inside the pockets of her long cloak . " We tried  --  who are you , anyway ? "  | " My name is Ume-Kai , " the minne began , and Rehur said , " A friend of mine , Medium , with the Cockaigne Theater . " Emerant made a shrugging gesture of apology . " We tried , " she said again . " Herself sent her down to Destiny , to the townhouse , thinking Fen would come to the Tower , but he came here instead . And now . . . . " Her voice trailed off , was absorbed into the sudden roar of the crowd . Rehur swung to face the pit again , the stones slick underfoot , and was grateful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pit , the seconds had finished their final business and retreated to the sides of the pit . Friends and kinsmen helped them climb back into the arches , leaving the combatants alone on the sanded floor . They stood apart for a long moment , Ixora watching the weighted tip of her whip write patterns in the sand , Fen slowly drawingthe braided cords through his fingers , and there were catcalls from the audience . Ixora looked up then , an odd half-smile on her face , and slowly brought her whip into the fighting position . She was afraid , Rehur knew , recognizing that expression from the days when he 'd manned the drag-brake for her , and clenched his own fists to stop from shaking . " Oh , Ixora , be careful , " he whispered , knowing he could n't startle her , that his words would be lost in the noise from the crowd . Fen had brought his whip up , too , and the two faced each other across the pit , just within reach of each other 's weapon . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time stretching through a dozen , two dozen of his heartbeats , heard as if through batting whistles and jeering shouts from the audience . Fen 's nerve broke first . With a shout , he swung his whip in a great arc , the tip cracking through the space where Ixora had stood . She moved in the same instant , swaying easily aside , brought her own whip into motion . She missed her first counter-stroke , to tangle and trap the other 's whip , and her follow-up attack missed by centimeters . Fen recovered , struck again . Ixora staggered , and there was a roar from the crowd as they saw the blood on her vest . That was what they had come to see , Rehur realized , and it added immensely to the sport that it was peopleof Family who bled . He swallowed hard , tasting bile . Ixora regained her balance in an instant , skipping back a few steps to buy time . Fen came after her , whip singing through the thick air . She feinted left , dodged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shoulder of his whip arm , thawing blood . There was more cheering at the sight . They were both more cautious after that , moving , using the length of the pit , breaking off the attack if their feints did not bring the desired reaction . A few voices jeered at them , calling for action , for blood , but the more knowledgeable hissed them to silence . Rehur dug his nails into Ume-Kai 's wrist , hardly aware of what he was doing . The whips snapped out again and again , drawing blood occasionally , more often missing their target entirely and forcing the attacker to leap back to avoid the counterstroke . Both Fen and Ixora were bleedingfreely now , each with half a dozen swollen cuts from the sharpedgedweights , but none was serious enough to stop the fight . They were breathing heavily now , and the pauses between attacks were lengthening . Rehur shivered , knowing what had to happen soon . Very few body blows could do enough damage to stop the fight ; only an attack on head or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed to want to take that step . Then , quite abruptly , Fen feinted high and struck as Ixora ducked . The crowd yelled its pleasure , but Fen was tiring . The attack fell short , the weight just grazing Ixora 's jaw . It drew a thin line of blood from the middle of her cheek down across her chin , and she struck back without plan , a direct blow at the Erling 's face . He had not expected something so unsubtle , was tangled in a counterfeint , and the weight struck him high on the right cheek , just below his eye . Fen screamed , dropping his whip , and sank to the sanded floor , holding his face in both hands . Blood welled from between his fingers , blood and something else . The crowd exploded with delight , urging Ixora to finish him . Rehur turned his head , fighting the desire to vomit . When he was able to look back , the seconds had reached the pit , and the crowd 's cheering had died into a sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paying off their odds . Ixora leaned into a friend 's arms , face distorted , her shoulders heavingwith exhausted sobs . Fen was hidden by the hovering bodies of his seconds , but Rehur caught a glimpse of one kneeling beside him , capably bandaging the injured man . " Rehur ! " The younger actor looked around with an effort . Emerant leaned close , fighting to be heard over the noise . " You 've got to get word to the Tower for me , tell Maturin what 's happened . Will you do that ? "  | " Ca n't one of the others do it ? " Rehur asked automatically . He looked over his shoulder for the Halex he had seen before , but the familiar faces had vanished . " They 've either run , or they 're busy with her , " Ume-Kai said . He nodded at the medium . " You go to her , too . We 'll take your message . " " Thank you , " Emerant said . She dropped awkwardly off the edge of the archway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arms . Ixora , still sobbing , let herself be held . " Come on , " Ume-Kai said grimly . " We 've got to find a terminal . "  |p119The  call came in a little before five hours of the clock-morning , on my private code . The flashing light and the muted whirring of the console alarm woke me at last , but I lay for a moment beneath my blankets wondering stupidly what was happening . Then it registered that a call on that line , at this hour , meant an emergency . I levered myself out of the bed , dragging a blanket with me because I could n't find my robe , and hit the flashing accept button on the second try . The screen flashed on , and Rehur looked out of it at me . " Rehur ? " I said , blankly , and groped for a chair . The ghost looked very white and frightened , and I could see the blurred figure of anotherman standing behind him . " Are you in trouble ? " Rehur laughed , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He shivered convulsively , the smile vanishing , and the other man put a hand on his shoulder . I wondered a little angrily who he was , and whether Rehur would introduce him . " Not me , " Rehur said again . " It 's Ixora . " Oh , my God , I thought , and instinctively keyed on the recorder . The Matriarch had sent Ixora into Destiny in the hopes of avoiding a duel . Had the idiot girl managed to fight in spite of that ? " Fen Erling hunted her out and challenged her , " Rehur was saying . " They fought , and he 's hurt  --  and should n't you be recording this , or something ? "  |p120His  voice trembled on the edge of hysteria . I saw the stranger 's hands move gently on Rehur 's shoulders , and said , as soothingly as I could manage , " I 've already got the tape going , Rehur . Take it slowly , start at the beginning , and tell me what 's happened . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rehur had n't been in at the challenge , had seen the whole thing more or less by accident , and was still sickened by what he had seen . It seemed to calm him to talk , however , and by dint of careful questioning , I got the full story as he knew it . He was calm enough then that I did n't feel too bad about letting him go ; I broke the connection and sat there for a moment , trying to think what I should do next . Herself would have to be informed , of course , but there were a few things I could  --  should  --  do first . Ixora had to be taken care of , for one . I called up the Tower 's communications net , waking the sleeping duty-operator , and got control of half a dozen outside lines . That was one advantage to the code , I thought , even as I punched in the numbers that might reach Emerant Ansson , the medium the Halex employed for their business in Destiny . My position was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be obeyed . Emerant was not at home , or at the Family townhouse . I hoped this meant she was with Ixora  --  I had a fairly high opinion of Emerant 's common sense  --  and left messages both places saying she was to find Ixora if she did n't have her , and return to the Tower at once . I called up the Tower operator then , and told her to hold those lines open for me on an emergency basis . Then I braced myself , and punched the codes that would reach the Matriarch . The light flashed for what seemed an interminable time , but then at last it steadied , though the screen remained blank . A voice said , " Yes , what is it ? " It was n't Herself , of course . I thought I recognized the voice of the Ansson cousin-kinswoman who acted as the Matriarch 's secretary , and keyed my own camera just in case she 'd set her machine to receive . " Lenor ? It 's Trey Maturin . " The sleepy voice sharpened instantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last was n't really a question . Even as she spoke , the picture faded into existence on my screen , showing me a thin-faced woman in her thirties , her long hair , braided for sleep , falling forward across her shoulder . I said , " I 'm afraid so , Lenor . You 'd better wake Herself  --  Ixora 's fought her duel . "  |p121Lenor  's mouth twitched , and the lines at the corners of her tilted eyes tightened momentarily , but she did n't waste time in exclamations . " I 'll do that . Would you inform the Heir , and the Branch Hold-ers ? " " Of course , " I began . There was a noise in the background , and Lenor turned to face the speaker . " Yes , ama , " she said , and turned back to the screen . " Herself says , Medium , would you also inform the Elders , and ask them all to meet in the Tower conference room by the end of the Eclipse ? " " As Herself wishes , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I sat staring at the keyboard and the fuzzy screen for a long moment . It would n't be easy to arrange for the senior members of the various Branches of the Halex Kinship to reach the Tower by seven standard hours , and some of them would have to attend by vis-link , but at least I could be sure of collecting the Elders  --  the Matriarch 's personal advisors  --  by then . I reopened my line to the Tower operator and began issuing orders . To my surprise , however , only the Holder Yslin Rhawn , caught high in the Prosperities inspecting one of his Branch 's mines , had to use the vis-link . The other two Holders , Barthel Ansson and Asbera Ingvarr , were in Destiny already , come to confer about the accident and its implications , and the Elders all lived in or around the Tower . They arrived by ones and by twos , in aircraft or groundcars  --  only one by the UHST  --  and were shown instantly to the upper room that the Matriarch had designated as her conference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ordered a full meal laid out on the sideboard , but no one seemed to want it . The Matriarch sat grim-faced at the head of the long table , the tape of Rehur 's story cued up in a reader at her left hand . She had listened to it alone , as soon as I had summoned Elders and Holders , and had not referred to it since . Only the Heir Magan , her son , Rehur 's father , had dared to ask to hear it , and she had sworn at him for his presumption . Magan refused to be deterred . " Surely we should all hear what 's happened before we make any decision , " he said . The words faltered into a question under his mother 's stony gaze . " We will hear that from Ixora , " the Matriarch snapped . " Not from the dead . " There was nothing Magan or anyone else could say to that , thoughp122I could see that the others , Elders and Holders alike , wanted more detail than the bald summary I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crossed to the sideboard to draw myself another cup of the vile Oresteian coffee . There was a narrow slit window above the board ; I glanced through it as I stirred spices into my drink . The Eclipse was ending , the light flooding back across the courtyard . In an hour or so , the first sliver of Agamemnon would be visible in the lapis sky . The window looked out onto the rising ground to the north of the Tower , toward the windmills that drove the Tower generators and , beyond that , toward Destiny . The thin blades were turning slowly in the steady wind , responding to air movements so light as to be almost imperceptible from the ground : there would be no power to spare this calendar-day , I guessed , but enough for common work . Then , in the sky above the left-end mill , I saw a flash of light . It was a small , fast flyer , heading for the makeshift field below the Tower , the only place flat enough to take flyer that was n't under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ixora , I thought , but said nothing until it came close enough for me to read the Halex marking on its tail . " Ama , " I said , pitching my voice to break the nervous silence . " I believe Ixora is arriving . " In the next breath , as they broke into nervous , low-voiced speculation , I damned myself for succumbing to the actor 's instinct . It might not be Ixora , could even be Yslin Rhawn , if he 'd been able to find transport fast enough . . . . The Matriarch was watching me , the shadow of a mocking smile on her thin lips . Even deep in her own troubles , she could recognize and appreciate my discomfort . But of course it was Ixora , and Ernerant Ansson with her , followed by two of Ixora 's agemates who 'd decided they could brave Herself 's anger . One , a dark girl called Dorenn , I remembered from the gang who had managed the hoobeys at the Garnocks ; the other I did not know . Rehur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though I had known better than to expect him , I felt a certain disappointment . They came through the door in a clump , no one wanting to be first , but then Ixora stepped out from the rest and made a sketchy bow . " Ama . " She had been hurt , all right . One bandage was pasted across her face to cover a cut running from the point of her jaw to the tip of her chin ; other injuries were implicit in the stiff , painful movements ofp123her upper body . The Matriarch saw that , too , and her voice was a fraction less grim when she spoke . " Well , girl , you 've made even more trouble for yourself this time . " Ixora took a deep breath , and winced as that stirred some hiddeninjury . She said , her words slurred by the topical anesthetic they hadused on her face , " I know , ama . But I was challenged . " That was unanswerable , and after a moment , the Matriarch 's eyes slid away toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call took me by surprise  --  I had expected her to demand an explanation , at least  --  but the secretary had clearly been waiting for it . " Ama ? " " Do your job . Get Yslin Rhawn , " Herself said , and turned her attentionback to Ixora . " Then we 'll hear what this one has to say for herself . " " Yes , ama . " The secretary rolled a small console away from the wall , touching keys as she did so . A holophone rose from its top , and an image blossomed above it : Yslin Rhawn , short and squat for an Oresteian , scowled at us all . " About  --  " His static-distorted voice broke off as he saw Ixora , and the Matriarch said , " Then we 're all here . " " No fault of mine I was n't there sooner , " Yslin protested , and I saw Lenor flush . " It was at my order you were n't called before , " Herself said impatiently . " No need to trouble you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And , I thought , no need to bring a troublemaker into the council until the last minute . At least she had silenced Yslin . His console was placed so that he could observe all of us , and I hastily smoothed my expression , willing myself to be as unobtrusive as possible . Among the Halex , only the Rhawn Holder had opposed my hiring  --  from sheer obstinacy , it seemed , rather than any reasoned disapproval , but I did n't want to make things any more difficult for the Matriarch . Herself shifted in her chair until she faced Ixora again , and folded her gnarled hands in front of her . Someone  --  Lenor again ?  --  had brought her a cup of coffee , but it sat untouched beside her right hand . Magan leaned forward as though he would say something , but his mother lifted one finger , and he steeled back in his place.  | " Now , Ixora , " Herself said . " Tell us what happened , from the be-ginning . " Ixora took another deep breath , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under her borrowed tunic , but her voice was steady enough , blurred only by the anesthetic on her face . " Ama , as you ordered , I went from the Tower to the Family 's house in Destiny . I stayed there , and did not go out , or tell anyone I was there . But someone must 've told  --  " She broke off , tardily afraid of making anotherrash accusation , and continued , " Somehow Fen found out I was there , and insisted on seeing me . He told Arnvid he lied when he said I was n't there , and Arnvid had to let him in after that . " She stopped , gathering strength . I bit back an exclamation of disgust . Arnvid Rhawn was the caretaker of the townhouse , ten years older than I was , and with the full dignity of his years to back him he should 've been able to keep Fen out . But honor forbade lying , and to be caught in a direct lie was at least horribly shaming , if not mortal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capitulating . That did raise the question Ixora had been afraid to ask : how did Fen Erling know she was there , and know it certainly enough to risk accusing a man older and higher in the social hierarchy than himself ? Someone must 've talked . . . . But that was a matter I could go into later . " Fen said I had called him a murderer and a liar in front of witnesses , " Ixora said , " which I had done , and that he was owed satisfaction . " She pushed back her hair with one hand and fixed a suddenlydefiant stare on the Matriarch . " He said that if I did n't fight him , he would take that as admission of guilt , and that the code would back him . I did n't see anything else I could do , so I agreed to meet him . Because I had choice of weapons , I picked whips , so I could n't kill him by accident . I hurt him badly , though . " She was silent for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then shook herself and continued . The rest of her story was nothing more than what Rehur had told me already , and I closed my mind to it , trying to think what this would mean . Fen was n't dead , so the matter of Ixora 's accusation still had to be decided  --  or did it ? Would this be like the very ancient days on Earth , when losing a duel meant that you were also assumed to be guilty of whatever crime had provokedthe fight ? Probably not : dueling was n't part of the originalp125code , was really only a sort of fashion among the younger bloods . Still , the whole incident , accusation and blinding , would only add to the already deep bitterness between Halex and Brandr . I could n't see any way of stopping the old feud from being declared again . Glancing around the table , I saw the same knowledge in half a dozen other faces . When Ixora had finished , there was a long silence , broken at last by a faint creaking as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left hand . " Well , Tirey ? What do you make of it ? " The man she had addressed , Tirey Ingvarr , shook his head slowly . He was a quiet , nondescript man in his late forties , and an expert on all the nuances of the code . " This creates a number of further difficulties , " he said , and could n't stop himself from a bitter glance toward Ixora . " I can not see that this has settled anything between Halex and Brandr , and it may well cause problems between Halex and Fyfe . " I frowned , not understanding yet , and Herself said , " Explain . " " Fen Erling is hurt  --  blinded , probably , " Tirey said . " But he owed the Fyfe something for causing the accident and killing Tasma Fyfeespeciallysince she 's an Heir's-daughter , even if she is n't Demi-heir . How will he pay it now , and will it be worth anything ? The Fyfe quarrel had precedence , and Ixora usurped it . " " Fen Erling challenged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a look . " That 's true , though , " Magan said . " She could n't refuse . " He stared at Tirey as though daring the other man to defy him . Tirey sighed , and I saw on his face a sudden , intense exhaustion . " But she could , " he said . " She could . A matter of precedence  --  settle her quarrel after Fen fulfilled his own obligations . " " That claim 's been disallowed more than once before , " another of the Elders  --  a youngish woman called Jannah  --  said sharply . " But it would 've let us avoid a quarrel with the Fyfe , " Tirey said patiently . He looked around the room , and let his gaze settle on Herself . " And we ca n't afford extra enemies right now . Ama , I see no way to avoid feud with the Brandr . Unless , of course , they choose to put a lenient interpretation on events . " His tone betrayed how likely he thought that to be . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shivered a little . It is a Mediator 's responsibility to do everything possible to avoid open conflict . I was n't at all sure what could be done , except to urge that this gop126before the Ship 's Council rather than be settled in blood . I opened my mouth to say just that , but at that moment there was a sharp knockingat the door , and it opened without waiting for the Matriarch 's command . " I beg pardon , ama , " said the girl who stood there , " but there 's an urgent message from the operator . The Fyfe and the Brandr Kinships wish a formal meeting with you  --  with the Kinship  --  before the clock-day 's over . " Whispered exclamations rustled around the table , and all heads turned toward the Matriarch . She glared at the runner in the doorway , visibly biting back her first comment . " Did they give a reason for this extraordinary summons ? " she said at last . " They said , ama , that they wanted to see if they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There was an edge to her tone , as though she did n't believe her own words , and Herself snorted in agreement . It hardly seemed likely , I thought . More probably , this was the obligatory meeting before the Brandr declared feud  --  but if that were the case , why were the Fyfe included ? The Matriarch glanced toward Tirey , who shook his head worriedly . " Ama , I do n't know what 's in their minds . " " What do you recommend ? " Magan asked softly . Tirey sighed again . " That we be ready to answer any accusations . That 's all I can say . " Herself turned back to the runner , still waiting patiently in the doorway . " You may tell the Brandr and the Fyfe that the Halex will meet with them this clock-evening . " She glanced quickly at Magan , who said , " The nineteenth hour ? Can we be ready by then ? " It was Lenor who answered , standing forgotten in a corner . " I can have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At the nineteenth hour , tell them , girl . And there 's no need to be too polite about it . " I winced at that , but the hard line of the Matriarch 's mouth warned me against making any protest . The runner nodded again , repeating the message to herself , and slipped out of the conference room . The Matriarch swept the rest of us with an imperious stare . " Well , about it , " she said at last , and pulled herself awkwardly to her feet . " There 's no time to waste if we 're to come out of this with the advantage . " The rest of the day was divided between helping Lenor and thep127Tower communications staff set up the holo-link with the two other Towers  --  as an off-worlder , I was presumed to know about computers and communications links , but in actuality , my role was reduced to typing commands into the test console , freeing the others for more important jobs  --  and acting as a sort of moderator in the discussions that followed Herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a lot to be done  --  everything had to be phrased with the utmost care in order to avoid admitting Ixora and the Halex had been in the wrong  --  and it was well into the afternoon before we had finished . Herself dismissed us to a hasty dinner , but despite the fact I had n't eaten more than a sandwich snatched near clock-noon , I found it impossible to stomach the heavy food . It was my job as Mediator to prevent this kind of trouble , to keep the Halex out of feud if I could , but I could see no alternative that the Matriarch  --  or her counterpart of Brandr  --  would accept . In the end , it was a relief when a runner finally appeared to tell us that it was time for the meeting . The holo-link had been set up in a pentagonal room on the first below-ground floor of the Tower . The technicians had shifted the treated screen-walls so that the working area of the room formed a triangle , cutting out the two screens that would not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on their well-oiled tracks as the technicians ran their last-minute checks . The Matriarch gave the mechanism a final , dubious glance , and moved to take her place at the long table that formed one of the three walls . She moved slowly , and Magan was careful to walk with her , offering unobtrusive support . The Matriarch settled herself awkwardlyin her place at the center of the table , and motioned impatientlyfor the rest of us to take our places . All around us , the light was turning blue , as though Sunset were approaching : the technicians had started the broadcast sequence . I could feel a faint vibration through the floor , as the Tower 's solid-fuel generators came on line , supplementing the windmills . My place was behind the Matriarch and to her left , the side of death and its mysteries on this dextracentricworld . I took it , careful not to lean against the fabric wall behind me , and waited . The same group that had been at the council this clock-morning was present , arranged in careful precedence by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , standing at the end of the table , was out of place  --  Ixora and Yslin Rhawn , I amended . The Holder was still in the Prosperities , unable to reach the Tower.  |p128His  face scowled at us all impartially from the holofunnel set to the Heir 's right . " Everything 's ready , ama , " one of the technicians said , and I saw the Matriarch take a deep breath . " Very well , " she said . " You may begin . " The light blued further , and the walls that converged in front of us , forming the point of the triangle , took on an odd luminescence . The technicians , hidden with their instruments behind the temporary fabricwall , murmured softly to themselves , and very slowly , images began to take shape in the walls in front of us . The left side , the Fyfe transmission , cleared first , and then the Brandr came into focus . Fen Erling , his face heavily bandaged , sat at the end of the Brandr 's table , near the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beside the Brandy Medium . Not a Holder , then , I thought , and not an Elder , either , so why is he here ? Then a chime sounded behind the fabric wall , and a technician said , " " The link 's complete , ama . " " Thank you , " Herself said . Her voice was without inflection , her harsh face composed as she stared at the images in the walls . " Fyfe and Brandy , welcome . " Halfrid Brandr , the Brandr Patriarch , said , his voice equally without expression , " Fyfe and Halex , welcome . " Almost before he had finished speaking , Araxie Fyfe said , " Halex and Brandr , welcome . " Unlike the others , the Fyfe Matriarch 's voice was hard and angry . She knotted her fingers together as though to imprison them , as though afraid of her own intentions . Trouble , I thought , and was not surprised when she cut through the Brandrs ' low-voiced courtesies . " Sor , ama , we 're here on serious business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Halex Matriarch . " I 'm here for my kin 's rights . " Herself took a deep breath , obviously controlling her own anger . " State your grievance , then , " she said , and somehow managed to keep the words from sounding too offensive . " Simple enough , " the Fyfe Matriarch snapped , and paused , to continuemore calmly , " Your cousin-kin fought and wounded Fen Erling . That was our right , for the death of our Heir's-daughter  --  my granddaughter !  --  Tasma . That is our grievance , ama . " " Ixora was the challenged , not the challenger , " Herself said , with surprising forbearance . " So she says , " Araxie Fyfe shot back , and there was a soft , indig/nant hiss from the Holder to my left . Herself threw out a hand to silence him . " Fen Erling is standing there . Ask him yourself , ama . " Halfrid Brandr said , " It is true , my cousin was the challenger , but he had been accused of lying and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ixora . Herself stiffened slowly at the deliberate insult . " She need not have accepted . " " Yes . " The Fyfe Matriarch took that up eagerly . " Our quarrel took precedence , and she knew it . " Herself took a deep breath and let it out slowly . " If Ixora had made that claim , ama , would n't Halfrid Brandr be standing before the Ship 's Council right now claiming code breach and cowardice ? " I held my breath . That was the best argument Herself had felt she could make , appealing obliquely to the Fyfe to ally themselves with the Halex against the Brandr . The two Families had common cause , both had suffered from the accident . . . . Araxie Fyfe 's stiff anger did not ease , and I felt that brief hope die . " Fen Erling is hardly beyond your reach , " Herself continued . " He can still answer for the death . " The Fyfe Matriarch shook her head . " That does n't erase the insult you offered us . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sharply , and I saw Halfrid Brandr smile . Ixora said , " Ama , that 's mine to pay . " " No , " Magan said , and the Halex Matriarch shook her head again . Ixora ignored them both , fixing her eyes on Araxie Fyfe . " Ama , I do n't say I was in error , because I still do n't see what else I could 've done , but I 'll accept the responsibility for hurting Fen Erling , and pay whatever I have to for it . " It was a strangely dignified appeal , coming from one who was possiblythe wildest of the Halex Family , and I saw Araxie 's face soften for the first time . Then Halfrid gave a scornful laugh . " Do you also admit you lied , calling my kinsman a liar and a mur-derer ? " I held my breath again , willing Ixora not to say anything stupid . I saw the muscles of her jaw tighten , saw her wince , before she answered , tonelessly , " I did n't speak to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inseparable , " Halfrid said . " Sor . " In the right-hand hologram , Anath Brandr leaned forward to catch his Patriarch 's attention . Halfrid frowned at him , but did notp130rebuff him , and I made a mental note to find out exactly where Anath stood in his Kinship . " Regarding that  --  incident , " Anath continued , " I remind you it took place immediately after the wreck , that no one was thinking clearly at the time . Also , as their own Medium will testify , Ixora was badly hurt . " He was offering that line of retreat again  --  and against the wishes of the Brandr Patriarch , if I read the deepening scowl on Halfrid 's face correctly . But he was also putting me on the spot . I looked down at the Halex Matriarch as if I could read the answer she wanted me to give in the elaborate coils of her braided hair . " Well , Medium ? " Araxie Fyfe demanded . " It 's true , " I said slowly , " that Ixora @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " But she has n't  --  does n't  --  retract it , " one of the other Brandr  --  the Erling Holder , I thought  --  pointed out with a sort of malicious detachment . " That 's not the issue , " Herself said , before anyone could pursue the question further . " It seems to me that the point in question is whether or not you , ama , will accept the offer of bloodprice . " She was looking at Araxie , but it was the Brandr who spoke . " Forgiveme , ama , but it seems to me the question is whether that bloodpricefills two obligations or only one . " " I acknowledge no obligation to you , Halfrid Brandr , " Herself returned . She continued to stare at the Fyfe Matriarch . This was the last chance to avert a Fyfe/Halex feud , and I found myself holding my breath for a final time . If only Araxie would concede that Ixora 's bloodprice , whatever it might be , did n't have to include admitting that she had been wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conflict . The silence stretched on until I was sure Herself would have to say something , anything , to relieve the tension . But she was silent , and finally Araxie said , " I do n't see that the two questionsare separate . Guilt in one implies guilt in the other . " " Nobody said anything about guilt , " Magan muttered , loudly enough to be heard . The Halex Matriarch said , " An error in one case does n't mean an error in the other , ama . " " Is that your final answer ? " the Fyfe Matriarch shot back.  | " It is . " Herself inclined her head toward the other woman , a nicely measured gesture of regret and respect . " Then this becomes a matter for the Ship 's Council , " " Halfrid Brandr said , a little too loudly . Herself nodded , and the Fyfe Matriarch said , " So it does . " " Rest assured I 'll bring it up , " Halfrid continued . " Sor , " the Halex Matriarch said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finally lost her patience , though I could n't see all of her expression . " If you do n't , I will . I 'm tired of your petty harassment  --  and I 'm inclined to believe Ixora , after all . " She nodded again to the Fyfe Matriarch . " Ama , until the Council . " Before the others could answer , she made a curt chopping gesture with one hand , and the technicians cut the link . The images in the wall froze , then slowly faded . " This means feud  --  two feuds , " Magan said . He rose , offering a hand to his mother . She accepted his support , grimacing , and pulled herself painfully to her feet . " That 's for the Council to decide , " she said , though her tone made it clear that she had little hope of any other outcome . " Still , we 'd better see to the arsenals . " The Ship 's Council could not be called in the single calendar-day that remained before Sunset , and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to wait for four long days before the genarchs could assemble : not only did the Council have to wait for Sunrise , but the Orillon Patriarch 's single Holder decided to make the long journey in from Electra , now on the far side of the system from Orestes . Herself tried to use this delay to advantage , gathering allies , but so did Halfrid Brandr  --  and the Halex had always been the envy of the other Kinships . That was the real reason the Fyfe had chosen to pursue its feud with the Halex rather than with the Brandr , I decided at some point in those long days . The Halex , richest of the Kinships , had been able to stand the economic changes better than the others had  --  the mine closings , the new emphasis on woollens and luxury products  --  and they had even profited from it . I said as much to Magan one evening after Herself had withdrawn , but he disagreed . It was the code , he said , and shrugged . Nothing more , the gesture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acceptance left me as chilled as I had been that night in Destiny , after I 'd seen The Man Who Killed in His Sleep . Then , at last , it was the day of the Council . As an off-worlder , ofp132course , I was n't allowed to attend , but like every other human being on Orestes not in the spectators ' gallery , I watched the proceedings on the comnet . Everything went as expected  --  accusation followed by denial and counter-accusation , Halex accusing Brandr of deliberately causing the accident and the deaths , Fyfe accusing Halex of usurping their rights , Brandr accusing Halex of lying . Testimony was given , evidence set before the genarchs and the Branch Holders-and all the while there was no attempt at mediation . The code called for black and white answers , guilty or not guilty , and left no room for the shades of grey that were closest to the truth . The ultimate decision had never been in doubt . By decree of the Ship 's Council , the Halex were declared to be at feud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fyfe/Brandr feud was left for later . I sat for a long time in my room after the decision was announced , staring out the narrow window across the pointed roofs of the storage silos that formed the eastern wall of the Tower compound . By the clock , it was well past the dinner hour , Orestes sliding toward the Eclipse that would come at midnight , but I was too restless even to begin to think of sleep . I had come to Orestes during a rare interval of peace : there had been no major feud since the previous Halex/Brandr feud had been settled six local years ago , and even that had been considered more of a quarrel than a feud for a dozen years before that . I found I had no clear idea what the feud  --  the feuds  --  would mean . Would there be street fighting , raids on the outlying farmsteads , murder , riots ? All those things had happened before during periods of feud  --  but not recently , not within living memory . After all , the code had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the para'anin , and the dead  --  during times of feud . More likely , I told myself , there would be an increase in the sort of petty infighting one saw at the best of times , quarreling in the various minor councils , harassment over grazing rights and import permits , maybe the occasional fistfight between the younger bloods of both Families , but nothing more serious . Serious enough , though , I remindedmyself . There would be more ghosts created , more work for me , and probably para'anin , too , as people chose to avoid the responsibilities of the feud . At least I hoped the ones who did n't want to fight would choose that honorable option . Outside , the light was fading again toward the eclipse . I sighed andp133stretched , then reached to close the thermal blinds , shutting out the rising shadows . The next clock-morning , and for the next several calendar days after that , however , the feuds might as well never have been declared . Business went on much as usual , the only difference being that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Family had with Brandr- or Fyfe-owned companies . That was expensive  --  together , the Fyfe and Brandr Mandates controlled the northern half of the main continent  --  and some of the Holders , especially Yslin Rhawn , protested the decision , but Herself was adamant . The Kinshiphad enough capital in reserve to accept the losses , she said , and she would not do less than her duty under the code . Neither the Brandr nor the Fyfe could really afford to lose those connections , either , she added , with one of her more wicked smiles , and the Axtell , doing their best to remain neutral , could hardly expect to take up the slack . Still , despite those changes and the occasional shouting match or fistfight in Destiny or Madelgar , the main city of the Brandr Mandate , life went on pretty much as usual for the first two grand-days after the declaration of the feuds . It was n't until the Dark of the third grand-day that trouble broke out in the Destiny Necropolis . Apparently , the problems started when a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that had been carried on a freighter landing in Destiny  --  common practice , since the Madelgar field was small , and most business was done through Destiny anyway  --  decided to stay over another calendar-day instead of flying back to Madelgar at once . Probably the hostility of the Halex working at the port provoked them to it , though nobody admitted it , but it hardly mattered . Towardclock-midnight , before Sunset had even faded , a fight broke out in front of one of the cabaret theaters inside the Necropolis . The Brandr , hugely outnumbered to begin with , were pretty badly mauled before the Destiny police could rescue them . Before Sunrise , one had died , and it looked as though at least one of the others would follow her . The Brandr retaliated , of course , with Fyfe help . The Halex , particularlythe Ansson Branch , ran sheep and hoobeys on the Equatorial Plain north of the Ostlaer River . It 's desolate country there , not really suited to anything but herding . I 've never envied the people who eke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thick-walled dome sheltersp134balanced on their ATVs as they follow the animals across the prescribedranges . I think they control the wanderings with sonics and range-ware ; mainly , though , they 're there to protect the sheep from the flagtails . Or from raiders , in time of feud : the Halex Mandate borders the Fyfe Mandate along the Bight , the narrow waist of the figure-eight-shaped main continent , just a few kilometers south of the equator itself , in the heart of the plains . The first raid was bad enough . A couple of heavy flyers swooped down on a flock of sheep that had strayed too near the Bight and strafed it , killing maybe a third of the animals and scattering the rest across the plains . The young woman herder prudently did not fight back  --  one woman , armed with a single-pulse rifle , against two flyers ?  --  buthid until the attackers left , then gathered the surviving animals and drove them back to the herders ' base town at Anamet . I thought it was a fairly impressive achievement , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was hauled before the Kinship council , examined o the subject of her cowardice , and declared dead . I had to preside at t e ceremony , and found it extremely difficult . She , along with most the other herders , took the whole thing stoicallyenough , and disa eared into Destiny as soon as the ceremony ended . Bad as that had ben , though , the second raid was worse . This time , the raiders came during the Dark , when the herders had to be most active against the flagtail packs , and they made the mistake of picking the herd run by a young Ingvarr couple . With the first woman'sfate fresh in their minds , the pair made a stand , and were killed . They did n't even have time to get off a signal for help to Anamet ; the attack was discovered only when they failed to answer the check signal the next clock-morning . Anamet dispatched a rescue flight at once  --  outfitting those groups was part of what the Matriarch had meant by " checking the arsenals , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too late . Both the Ingvarrs were dead , and the herd had been slaughtered . The attacks cast a deep gloom over the Tower for some calendardaysafterwards . Herself conferred with Holders and Elders , but since it was clear these attacks had no direct sanction from the other two genarchs , they agreed she could take no direct action herself . Responsibilityfor carrying on the feud fell naturally on the younger membersof the Kinship . For several days , the Tower was filled with youngp135men and women , mostly of Rohin 's generation . They gathered in corners or in conference rooms that had been out of use for years , talking only to each other . Rohin was very much a part of it all , and I thought once or twice that he wanted to talk to me , ask my advice or simply share a confidence , but I avoided him . My oath as a Mediator  --  my commitment to my work  --  pushed me to tell him not to act , and that , under the circumstances , was very bad advice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as suddenly as they 'd arrived , the group vanished . The repeatedroar of flyers ' lift-offs woke me well before the usual hour , and when I went down to the hall for breakfast , a quarter of the chairs were empty . The Tower was ominously silent for the rest of the day , and even the Matriarch seemed distracted , waiting for whatever was going to happen . I did my best to concentrate on my own work , reviewing the various mediums ' monthly reports on the ghosts under their charge , but the conference room we were using had a window , and my eyes were drawn to it again and again , searching for the flyers . The first flyers did not return until after dinner that clock-evening . I heard them from my room , and put aside my glass of esco  --  almost the last of my last bottle  --  to cross to the window and look out . Orestes was heading toward Sunset , the pinpoint sun dropping toward the horizon , lightening the dark sky . Against that brilliance , another light  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a second and a third . The leading ship tilted and moved out of sight , heading for the field behind the Tower . The others followed , but I was no longer watching . I turned instead to my keyboard to type in the commandto bring up the Tower 's general information line . Instead of the usual half-screen heading , I got a curt error message : everyone else was trying to get through , too . I hesitated for an instant . Should I go down to the hall , or to the working levels , and see what was going on ? Or should I wait here , where I could be summoned if needed ? Without making a conscious decision , I stepped to my door and opened it , leaning out into the dimly lit hall . Other off-world employees were milling around in the shadows , and the few Halex who shared the floor with us looked just as confused . I did n't want to get too far from my keyboard , and hesitated again . Then I thought I saw a familiar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Corol ! What 's happening , have you heard ? " At my call , the greying driver detached himself from the others , and came to join me . " They 've made a raid , Medium , but I do n't know more than that . " It was hardly a surprise , but the pit of my stomach contracted . More dead , surely  --  and true-dead , too , not just ghosts . . " Where ? " I asked , involuntarily , and Corol shrugged . " I told you , I do n't know , " he said , but he was grinning . " There 's going to be an announcement on the ' net in an hour , " someone shouted from a doorway . " I 'll have to wait to see if I 'm needed , " I said , half to myself . If the raid had been successful  --  and surely we'd 've heard if it had n't been  --  Herself would n't need my services at once , though she might need me later if there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was obviously my duty to wait by my machines until I was sent for  --  but I could n't face the prospect of waiting alone . " An hour ? " I said aloud . " Come in and wait with me , Corol , we 'll split a pot of coffee . " Corol gave me a glance full of amused understanding . " Thank you , Medium , I 'll do that . " We retreated to my rooms , though I kicked the chock that would hold the door open about a hand's-breadth into place . The noise in the hall was already dying down as people realized that no news was immediately forthcoming . I buzzed the kitchens and asked them to send up a full coffee service  --  one of the three things the kitchen would make at any hour  --  and set the dumbwaiter to chime when the tray arrived . When I turned back to the room , Corol was standing at the window , staring out toward the field . " More flyers coming in , " he said , without turning . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw three land earlier , " I said . That meant at least six ships , I thought , and more could easily have landed while we were talking in the hall . How many people had been involved in this raid , anyway ? Six flyers was a major strike force  --  certainly a lot bigger than anythingthe Brandr or the Fyfe had set against us . As if he 'd read my thoughts , Corol said , " Two of the ones I saw were light jobs , two-seaters . " So it was n't a ground attack , I thought . A raid on the Fyfe herds , maybe ? Aloud , I said , " I would n't think they 'd be much use in a raid . "  | " That depends , " Corol said , and turned away from the window . His face was very thoughtful all of a sudden , and I wondered what he 'd seen that had worried him . Before I could ask , however , the chime sounded , and I turned to take the service from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on your ' net , Medium ? " Corol continued . I shook my head , trying to balance the coffee with one hand while sweeping papers aside to make room for the tray on the room 's low center table . By the time I had things arranged properly , Corol had turned away from the screen again , shaking his head . " Nothing yet . " I looked anyway . The screen showed only a test pattern and the words " please wait " superimposed over it . " They said an hour ? " I asked . " So Embla said . " Before Corol could say anything more , there was a knock at the door . " Who is it ? " I called , a little impatiently . " Us , Dario and Slade . Can we come in ? " " Sure . " The Patroclans pushed their way in , stepping awkwardly over the chock . I had n't seen them , except in passing , for some weeks , and I was startled by the sudden wariness in their mobile faces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coffee , glad I 'd ordered a full service . Yan shook his head , grimacing . Orteja said , " Trey , what 's going on ? They 're saying that a bunch of Halex kids sank a Brandy fishing fleet . " " What ? " I said , in spite of myself , and Corol snapped , " Saying where ? " " Everywhere , " Yan answered . " I had n't heard even that much , " I said . Looking at their worried faces , I put aside my own desire for information and said firmly , " Sit down , get yourselves some coffee . We wo n't hear anything reliable until the official announcement . " Yan made another face , but settled himself in the nearest chair , then leaned forward stiffly to pour two cups of the thick coffee . Orteja lowered himself to the floor at his partner 's feet . " Sank a fishing fleet , " Corol said thoughtfully . " That would explain the little flyers , at least , for strafing . " " What a mess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them an amused glance , and lifted an eyebrow at me , as though inviting me to share in the joke . I pretended not to see . " Do you think it 's likely , Corol ? " I asked . The driver shrugged . " It 's possible . It 'd make sense  --  and what a revenge it would be . But I do n't know any more than you do , Me-dium . " The rest of the hour passed with excruciating slowness . At last , however , I glanced at the time display I had called onto the main console screen , to see the test pattern fading into the pale blue walls of the broadcast chamber . I fumbled hastily for the keyboard , cancellingthe time display , and heard Corol make a small noise of satisfaction . The Patroclans set their cups aside almost in unison , fixing their attention on the screen . The picture took shape slowly  --  all the Tower 's facilities were nearly a decade out of date , by Urban standards  --  the Matriarch staringsternly into the camera @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ previous days , the grim lines eased from around her mouth , and I wondered for a split second , irrationally , if there 'd been no raid at all . As soon as that thought took shape , I knew it was foolish  --  and then Herself began to speak . " Kinsmen , I bring you good news , after the difficulties of the past weeks . A group of our young people , the kindred of my grandson 's generation , led by Jaben Ingvarr , have successfully raided the Branch fleet in the Grand Shallows . Not only was their primary objective , the disruption of the schools of leva now running in the Shallows , achieved completely , but nearly a dozen fishing boats were capsized or otherwise damaged . I ask you to join with me in saluting these members of our Kinship . " There was more , but I was n't really listening . The Grand Shallows lay to the east of the Bight , an immense bay silted by deposits from the Ostlaer River to the south , and the Tarentaese to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done there , in sheltered water , rather than in the open sea , and the Brandr Kinship monopolized that trade . Once , on a flight from Destiny to Madelgar , I had seen the fleet in action , following a run of boi-boi . The blunt-nosed , broad-beamed little ships had seemed very small from the air , very fragile . I remembered , too , the Brandr pilot talking about the risks the fishermen ran  --  boi-boi were big fish , predators hunted with harpoon , a rare and dangerous catch . People always died during a boi-boi chase , he hadp139said . Someone would be dragged overboard , and the thermal suits only gave you five minutes ' grace before you died of the cold . Herself had bragged of capsized ships . I wondered how many of their crews had died in the frigid water , and shivered in spite of myself . " Is n't leva the staple food in the Brandr Mandate ? " Orteja asked . Corol grinned wolfishly . " It is that . " " It 's also a staple of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sharply than I 'd intended . " This wo n't help the Necropolis at all . " Corol shrugged that off , still grinning . " Oh , we can tighten our belts quite a bit without hurting , Medium . Brandr 'll starve before we do . " I was n't entirely sure about that  --  the ghosts were still partly the responsibility of their original Families , and would not starve , but the poorer Para anin , deliberately kinless , were another matter ; however , looking at the driver 's triumphant face , I did n't feel like arguing the question . Maybe I should 've obeyed my first impulse , I thought  --  encouraged Rohin to talk to me about his plans . Maybe I could 've stopped this , or diverted it into other channels . But it had n't been Rohin 's plan , I told myself . I would only have made things difficult , maybe laid him open to a charge of cowardice . Still , I could n't shake the feeling that I could 've done something . " Will this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( rowing over a new problem . " Of the fish ? " I asked , and he nodded . " Probably . They 're surprisinglyvulnerable to environmental disturbances . The earthquakes two years ago disturbed the runs for a whole year , according to the records . " " I hope it does , " Corol said , a little impatiently . " God almighty , we 're at feud . " He looked directly at me . " Will you be at the celebration , Medium ? " Celebration ? I thought . I had n't heard the announcement , but of course there 'd be one . I could n't muster much enthusiasm for the idea , and shook my head . " I do n't think it would be appropriate , " I improvised , " just in case there 're mortal questions later . " Corol nodded , apparently appeased . " I doubt there will be , Medium , but I see your point . You do n't mind if I take myself off , do you ? " " Not at all , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the driver said , punctiliously , and let himself out . One of the Patroclans sighed audibly . " More coffee ? " I said . " No , thank you , " Yan answered , and Orteja said , with sudden decision , " Trey , we 've just about completed our survey . Would you make arrangements for us to return to Patroclus ? " " Kassan and Cho were hired to do a complete analysis of the miningdistrict , " I said . " That 's not done , is it ? " " The survey work is , " Orteja said . " The rest is computer work  --  analysis and simulations , " Yan added . " That 's better done on our home equipment anyway . There 's nothing here with the capacity to do it . " That was certainly true , but I waited anyway . " Besides , " Orteja went on , " there 's nothing in our contract that says we have to stay during a feud . " " It 's a state of war , " Yan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ playing a winning card , " union rules . " Most unions did absolve their members from taking sides in planetaryconflicts outside the Urban sphere . I bit back my first angry remark , recognizing the jealousy that fueled it , and said , " You 're within your rights , of course . I 'll speak to Herself in the morning . " " Thank you , Trey , " Orteja said , and Yan echoed him . The Matriarch accepted the Patroclans ' imminent departure more calmly than I had expected , even going so far as to bestow guest-gifts . I made the arrangements as they had requested , and managed to find them a berth on a woolship leaving in eight days for Leda . From there , they would have no trouble finding a ship for Patroclus , and I found myself envying them a little . After all , they were walking away from the whole complicated situation  --  they were able to walk away from it , from the code , from the feud , from everything  --  while I was bound both by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But there was work to be done , and the feeling soon passed . We had all expected some sort of retaliation for the raid on the fleet , and Herself ordered special patrols for all the Kinship 's outlying holdings , but days passed , and nothing happened . There were other things to do , especially in Destiny , but also in outlying areas , where some arrangement had to be made to warn the dead in case of further raids . I threw myself into that work , and became so absorbed in it that I barely noticed the quiet . I wouldn't 've thought that much of itp141if I had noticed , but the Halex did , and the Tower subsided into a nervous quiet . Two calendar-days after the Patroclans ' departure , Herself sent for me . I was up in the greenhouse at the top of the Tower , playing hookey from my work to indulge in its warmth and conversation with one of the gardeners . She was a woman who 'd been off-world and travelled quite a bit before coming home to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in common , and I was desperate for reminders of the Conglomerate as a whole . I sat on a painted bench beneath a flowering tree , listening to her talk about the various herbs that filled the raised beds to either side . Some  --  the majority , I think  --  were native to Orestes ; the rest she and the other gardeners had either brought home from their travels , or had shipped to the planet from their original worlds . One or two of the flowers I recognized as common on the Urban worlds , and was surprised they 'd grow here . " Well , you have to plant them separately , " Maxa said , " and feed and light them according to the original worlds . But as long as you pay attention , you can make them thrive . " She pushed herself rather stiffly to her feet , brushing absently at the front of her heavy apron , and glanced over her shoulder . " I think business 's caught up with you , Medium . " I looked where she pointed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was standing uncertainly beside the kiosk that covered the stairhead and kept the heat from escaping . The brief illusion shattered , and I raised a hand to beckon to him , suddenly aware of the steam-fogged glass walls , and the Dark beyond them . Out of the corner of one eye , I could see Agamemnon 's waning crescent . The boy came over to us , breathing heavily . He was new to Tower service , probably relocated because of the feuds . His face bore the Halex tattoo , and his hair was twisted into an untidy topknot : from one of the outlying areas , I guessed , and wondered what the rest of his family was doing . " I beg your pardon , Medium , if I 've disturbed you , but Herself would like to see you right away . " Despite the boy 's politeness , it was a summons that allowed no argument . I nodded , and said to Maxa , " I 'd better go . Thanks for your company . " " My pleasure , " the gardener @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next time , and share my break . "  | " I 'll do that , " I answered , and followed the boy down the long stairs into the body of the Tower . It seemed very cold there , after the warmth of the greenhouse . I shivered , pulling on the overtunic I 'd discarded , and wished for a heavier wrap . Herself was waiting in her private office , where she conducted most of the Kinship 's minor business . It was a small room , furnished with an inexpensive executive 's console and some heavy , well-padded chairs . Usually , she worked there alone , or with the secretary Lenor to help her ; today the little room was crowded , and they 'd had to bring in extra chairs from the conference room next door . I looked around once . Magan was there , and Lenor , of course , but also the Elder Tirey Ingvarr and a woman who looked familiar but whose name I could not immediately remember . " You took your time getting here , " Herself snapped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I said , " I 'm sorry , ama , I was n't in my office . " I did n't offer any further apology , and for a moment I thought she 'd pursue the matter , but then she snorted and looked away . " All right , Aude , you may go . " The boy 's flush deepened , and he backed from the room , closing the door tightly behind him . " Well , Medium , " Herself said . " We have a new problem , one you will have to help us with . Sit down . " " Oh ? " I sat . There was no need , on Orestes , to assure the Matriarch of my cooperation : that had already been guaranteed , by contract and code alike . " You remember my kinswoman Coronis , " Herself continued . I nodded , to hide the start of surprise . Of course , that was the woman sitting beside Magan , her hands folded so tightly in her lap  --  Coronis , who 'd married Eyre Brandr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has brought us news . " The Matriarch was silent for a long moment , so long that Coronis looked up abruptly . " Shall I tell it , ama ? " The words were a challenge , but her thin hands moved restlessly for a moment before the fingers closed again around each other . Herself frowned . " No . " She fixed her eyes on me . " Medium , it has come to our knowledge  --  our certain knowledge  --  that the Brandr Kinship is going off-world for weapons , and maybe for men to use them . We feel we must do the same . "  |p143I  shifted uneasily in my chair . Before I could say anything , Coronis said , low-voiced , " It 's true , I swear it . Eyre and I both heard , Eyre confirmed it . " She looked quickly at the Matriarch . " You understand my situation , ama . Eyre 's dead , by law , and I 've kept the code myself , so I could tell you what 's happened , but not any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I want the money to go off-world , to get out of this  --  place . " My God , poor Coronis , I thought . To have come all that way with her husband a ghost beside her . . . . I heard Tirey give a little offendedgasp , but Magan leaned across to touch Coronis 's shoulder lightly . " It seems only right , Mother , " he said . " It is n't proper , " Tirey muttered , " to pay for information . " " Oh , be quiet , " the Matriarch snapped . " Coronis is kin ; she 'll have whatever she needs . What matters is to arrange weapons of our own . God knows , there 's nothing on Orestes to match the things they 're buying . " I could feel everyone looking at me , and said quickly , " What are they buying , ama ? " Herself waved her hand impatiently . " Guns , explosives , ammuni-tion . " Lenor leaned forward quietly , a sheet of paper in her hand . " Small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clarified . " Artilleryfrom five-kilo mortars up to a pair of sonic field-pieces . Nothing larger than that , however . " I drew a rather shaky breath , trying to take it all in . If this were true  --  and there did n't seem to be much reason to doubt it  --  then it looked like we were in for a very bad time indeed . And my own duty was less than clear . As a Conglomerate Mediator , I was supposed to keep things from reaching this point , but Orestes ' crazy social system had made that impossible from the beginning . On the other hand , I could hardly refuse to help my employers protect themselves , even if it meant that more fighting was inevitable . It was inevitable anyway , I told myself , feeling new chill settle in my bones . " How long has this been going on ? " Herself looked suddenly tired . " We do n't know . " " Eyre found out two weeks ago , " Coronis said , quietly . " And it had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out the deliverydate , but he could n't  --  they did n't trust him . Then he told me , and died . "  | " We thought about taking this to the Ship 's Council , " Magan said , " a breach of code , but Tirey says it 's no different from our bringing in outside contractors . We ca n't protest . " I shook my head . There was no telling what the Brandr had planned , when the arms would land , how much trouble we were in . " What do you want me to do ? " " You 're a Mediator , as well as our Medium , " Herself answered . " And an off-worlder . We need arms to stop whatever it is they 're planning . I want you to advise Magan in the negotiations . " " There 's another possibility , ama , " I said . " I 'm duty-bound to mention it . " That was n't strictly true , but it would get a hearing for something she would n't like . " As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "  --  I have certain powers . With your sanction , I can appeal to the Commercial Board , and possibly stop the importationof these weapons . " The Matriarch did n't say anything , watching me through narrowed eyes . Magan asked , " On what grounds ? " That was the tricky part . I chose my words very carefully indeed . " On two grounds . First , and least good , that the technology is too advanced . " Magan raised an eyebrow , and I hurried on . " Second , that its import causes economic hardship . " " No . " That was the Matriarch . " We wo n't plead charity . " " Hardship for the Brandr , " I said . " No , " the Matriarch said again . Tirey said , gently , " This is a feud ; we ca n't consider them . " This is n't real consideration , I wanted to say , it 's a weapon you can use against them , but I knew what Tirey would say to that . The code @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judge , after all ?  --  and the appearance of kindness toward the Brandr would be enough to damn Herself and her kin . I said instead , knowing I was beaten , " Buying weapons will be expensive , especially for immediate delivery . " If Brandr can scrape together the money , so can I , " the Matriarch said . " He will have mortgaged everything for this , but we can pay . " I took a deep breath , and held it for a moment , wishing I 'd never taken this job . Still , I was bound by my contract , and a part of me , the actor , long suppressed , could n't help enjoying the inevitability of it all . " Very well , ama , as you wish . "  | " Thank you , " Magan said . The Matriarch nodded calmly : she had never considered the possibility I might refuse . " Get on with it , then , " she said . " There 's no time to waste . " Magan and I spent the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kinship 's Master-at-arms , a grey-haired , taciturn man called FerrilHalex , acted as advisor , and drew up a list of the things he thought the Kinship needed . There are any number of reputable arms dealers in the Conglomerate , though the Halex were too poor to afford , say , the n ' Thaieona or the Hephaistians . We took Ferril 's list , and went shopping among them . Prices were high , counting in the charges for delivery to such an out-of-the-way world as Orestes , and there was very little I could do to talk the prices down again , especially since we needed the weapons immediately . The best price was from a companybased on Fenris , which maintained a depot on nearby Pippa . It would n't give us a lot of choice , but at least the shipping costs would be lower . The Matriarch agreed , committing the last of her free capitaland a good third of next year 's income , and we submitted the order . Now there was nothing to do but wait , and hope that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Major landed just after local noon . It took two hours for crew and cargo to clear Customs , and Moraghan made her way across the field to the main administrative building , frowning thoughtfully to herself . Something was wrong ; she had known that from the minute Pipe Major hit the system buoy and she 'd made contact with the harbormasterOslac , but she could n't put a name to it . The pilot  --  not Guil , to Moraghan 's profound regret , but a man who 'd never flown Pipe Major before  --  had given careful non-answers to Moraghan 's oblique questions , and his reticence kept her from asking anything directly . Had the hostility between Destiny and Madelgar flared up again ? the captain wondered as she climbed the stairs to the main level . Oslac had given her a harder time than usual about the shipmentshe carried for Madelgar . At the final checkpoint , she swung her campaign bag onto the counter one-handed , and waited while the duty officer checked through it . The woman smiled down  --  she topped Moraghan by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Enjoy your stay , Captain . " " Thanks . " Moraghan slipped her useless left hand into the belt of her coat , then slung the campaign bag back over her right shoulder . It felt very light in Orestes ' low gravity , and she walked carefully , controllingher movements . Behind her , she could hear the cheerful chat/ter of her crew , Sabas 's voice dominating the rest , but she did n't turn . A familiar figure was waiting on the far side of the barrier  --  a tall woman whose oval face was crowned with fine , white-blond hair . " Guil ! " Moraghan felt her own face stretch into a grin , and pushed through the gate with reckless speed . " It 's good to see you . " " And you , " the tug pilot answered warmly , but there was a shadow of  --  something  --  in her pale eyes . The two women embraced , awkwardly because of Moraghan 's bag and the difference in their heights , and then Guil pulled away . " I need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt a surge of disappointment . The two had spent the captain 's last Oresteian leave together . Surely , Moraghan thought , it was n't unreasonable to expect a warmer greeting ? Then the rest of her crew swirled around them , Sabas with a knowing smirk , the engineer Askel as expressionless as ever , the juniors , Orino and Tham , still wide-eyed at the thought of exploring another new planet . " You be staying at your usual place , Captain ? " Sabas asked , and winked his good eye . Moraghan gave him the look she 'd perfected for subordinates of his type , the one intended to make him feel that she considered him an uninteresting species of insect . " I do n't know yet , " she said evenly . " I 'll let Askel know ; call him if you need me . You will be at the Asteria , right ? " Askel touched his throat and nodded . " I 'll call you in an hour , " Moraghan said , dismissing them . Sabas , as usual , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mumbled phrase , got him moving . The juniors were only too eager to be gone . Moraghan watched them out of earshot , then turned back to the tug pilot . " What 's the problem ? " Guil grimaced , then shrugged one shoulder in an **27;15360;TOOLONG gesture . " We ca n't talk here . Let 's try the pilots ' lounge . " Almost no one used it , Moraghan knew , for all that it boasted a cheap robo-bar and heavily cushioned couches . The port was too close to Destiny and the Necropolis to make it attractive . She nodded , and let Guil lead her down the uncrowded corridors . The lounge was empty , as usual , the thermal blinds half closedp148against the sunlight . Moraghan shivered , and Guil , with an apologetic glance in her direction , crossed to the windows to open the blinds . The light that streamed in was more warming to the psyche than to the flesh , Moraghan knew , but the bright bands turned the dark carpetto rich crimson , gave the whole room new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What 'll you drink ? " Guil called , from the bar 's order board . " Tsaak ? " Moraghan called back . The local liquor had the advantages of being cheap and hot , and probably available . The para ' an touched a button , waited , and returned to the table at last with a padded carafe and a pair of stone cups . She poured the drinks in ceremonious silence , and Moraghan took the first sip , savoring the sudden spicy warmth in the pit of her stomach . " So what can I do for you , Guil ? " she said again . The para ' an looked down at her half-empty cup , turning the polishedstone from side to side . " Have you heard about the trouble ? " she asked . " I knew it , " Moraghan exclaimed , then waved aside the other 's look of inquiry . " No , I do n't know what 's going on at all . I just knew something was up when we got here . What is it ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So are the Halex and the Fyfe . " Moraghan shook her head . That meant nothing to her , except that the Halex were quarrelsome , but Destiny was in the Halex Mandate , and she kept the thought to herself . " What does that mean ? " Guil gave her a rather odd look . " It gives them license to kill each other , that 's what it means . And they 've been doing just that . " Moraghan felt a sudden sickness in her belly , all her Peacekeeper 's training rushing back . Private wars , planetary wars were bad  --  that had been the first lesson . Bad for trade , bad for civilians , and most of all bad for the Peacekeepers , who 'd be called in sooner or later to settle things . She swallowed that reaction , reminding herself that things were different on Orestes , and that she , herself , was no longer a Peacekeeper . " So what do you want me to do about it ? " Guil flushed , and Moraghan was belatedly aware @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm sorry , Guil , go on . Bad memories . " The para ' an nodded , mollified . " It 's more than just the feud , that 's nothing special . But , Leith , I think the Brandr are bringing in weaponsfrom the Urban Worlds , stuff the Halex ca n't match , and  --  hell ,  |p149it  's not right . You 've got connections , you used to be a Peacekeeper , so I thought  --  " She hesitated , then took a firm breath and went on , " I thought you might know somebody who could stop it , if they knew about it . " There 's more to this than meets the eye , Moraghan thought , watching the para an 's mobile face set into an angry frown , but I do n't know Orestes well enough to know the key . It 's not like Guil to worry about politics . Usually , she 's pretty cynical . The captain hesitated , trying to frame a noncommittal answer , and Gull burst out , " I know it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my kin if I were n't para ' an , but something needs to be done . What do you think they 're going to do with those weapons , Leith  --  hold a football match ? " Moraghan shook her head slowly , frightened in spite of herself . For Guil to step out of her place , things had to be pretty bad . " No . I 'm thinking , Gull , I 'm not sure who to contact . " The para an nodded , mollified , and Moraghan poured herself anothercup of tsaak , grateful for its warmth . " How did you find out about this , anyway ? " Guil shrugged . " I 'm the substitute , remember ? They needed a back-up pilot at Madelgar . They do n't have much of a staff there , and of course , they could n't hire any of the regular Destiny port workers . Because of the feud , " she added , before the captain could ask . " Most of the Destiny people are Halex . Anyway , they were n't happy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make the run-in without knowing there was a back-up available , so the Madelgar harbormasterbrought me in . " She gave a humorless smile , just a flash of teeth in her tanned face . " They stuck me off in a little room , and kept me there , where they thought I would n't hear anything . And then to be doubly sure , they made me promise I would n't tell anybody about this . " She stopped again , scowling , and Moraghan guessed it was that broken promise that galled her most . " But I 'm para an , I 'm not expected to keep my word . And besides , I do n't have proof , just that what I heard made me pretty sure that 's what they 're doing . " " Why have n't you told the Halex ? " Moraghan asked . Guil gave her a blank look . " They could n't listen to me . I 'm para ' an and I 'm breaking my given word . " Damn that , Moraghan thought , but bit back the words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way the system works , that 's the way it works . Is there anything I can do ? She chewed thoughtfully on her lower lip ,  |p150not  really feeling the pain . First , I can warn Maturin-it 's a Medium 's business to deal with Para anin , if I understand the system at all . Maturincan warn the Halex . As for off-world . . . . It takes a local complaintto bring in the Peacekeepers , but maybe a word at the Trade Bureau would do some good ? Then she remembered Stephan Mojag , who 'd been part of her drone squadron before he cracked up a free flyer . He 'd picked a post in Trade rather than a mailship position ; maybe he could help her now . She put the tsaak cup aside and reached into the pocket of her coat for her chronometer , drew it out on its short chain and laid it , miniboard up , on the table top . It was hard to manipulate the stylus one-handed , and Guil leaned across to steady the machine . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Moraghan used the stylus to punch the tiny buttons , then waited for the result to appear on the finger-width screen . " An old  --  colleague , from the Peacekeepers . He 's with the Trade Board on Ganesha ; he might be able to do something . " The numbers appeared at last , and Moraghan muttered a curse . " Trouble is , it 's the middle of the night there , and I 'd have to leave a message , with no guarantee he 'd upload it in the morning . I think I 'd better wait and call him then . " Guil nodded . " All right . Look , would you stay with me again ? It 's the least I can do , after all this trouble . " Moraghan smiled . " No trouble . And I 'd like to stay , please , Gull . " " Good . " Guil 's answering smile was rather diffident . " We can head on , then , unless  --  " Moraghan shook her head . " I 'm done here . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tsaak , then awkwardly , stuffed the chronometer and its chain back into her pocket . " Fine . " Guil nodded . " Look , I have an errand to run , on Mill Street . You 're welcome to come with me , of course , but if you 'd rather go on to the flat , I 'll gladly give you the key . " " I 'll come with you , " Moraghan said . " I 've never seen the mills . " " I 'm just going to one of the shops , " Guil warned . " And you might not want to carry your bag all that way . " " In this gravity , it hardly weighs a thing , " Moraghan said , not quite truthfully . " No , I want to come with you , Guil . If you do n't mind . "  |p151The  para ' an shook her head . " Glad of the company , " she said . " Come on . " It was a cloudless day , the brilliant pinpoint of Atreus almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was from the east , and cold . Moraghan was glad of her heavy spacer 's coat , no matter how outlandish it made her look . Guil loosened the clasps of her outer jacket as they made their way to the tram stop , muttering something about the heat . The others waiting in the shelter , Moraghan noticed with wry amusement , had also loosened or discarded their outer layers of clothing . The captain guessed it might be as much as thirteen degrees without the cooling wind . The first tram that passed was a local , bound for the residential precincts just across the bridge . The second car through was the one they wanted , bound for the High Street and ultimately for the UHST terminus . Moraghan followed Guil aboard  --  this time , she let the tug pilot pay both fares , rather than fumble for it herself  --  and wedged herself with the pilot against the tram 's rear wall . There were no seats available . Moraghan let her bag fall from her shoulder , dropping it between her feet , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaned close as the tram lurched into motion . " Sorry about this , but we 've got a way to go . " " No problem , " Moraghan said , and meant it . She leaned forward a little as the tram slowed for the river barriers , trying to catch a glimpse of the city proper . It looked very different in daylight , the buildings no longer shadows picked out in strings of light , but solid , sober structures , local stone and wood shaped to local needs . There had never been much attempt to copy off-world styles , and Moraghan found herself approving that integrity . If , of course , she added silently , it was integrity and not poverty that kept the builders to this style  --  but Destiny had always been a wealthy city . The tram lurched as it came off the bridge , lurched again as it came up onto the turntable . With a whine of motors that sent a new vibrationthrough the floor , the table swung slowly clockwise , until the nose of the tram was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , shop-lined street . The sidewalks were filled with pedestrians , and there was a surprising amount of traffic , mostly sporty three-wheelers . Moraghan remembered Guil saying those were mostly used by the younger members of the rich mainline families , and leaned forward.  | " What street 's this ? " " This is the High Street , " Gull answered , raising her voice slightly to be heard over the rattle of the tram . " It runs from the port all the way through Destiny , and then out to the Halex Tower proper . " She ducked her head , trying to see out through the tram 's scratched windows . " Come on , the next stop 's ours . " Moraghan followed obediently as the Para ' an worked her way through the crowd to the rear door . The tram slowed even as they went ; by the time they 'd reached the door , it was open , and the two women clattered down the steps to the minuscule platform . Gull gauged the passing traffic  --  six-wheeled cargo trucks and even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  with a practiced eye , and whistled , beckoning for Moraghan to follow . The captain did , expecting every instant to be struck down by a passing vehicle , and was more than a little surprised when they reached the sidewalk alive . " Could n't we have waited ? " she asked . " For what ? " Gull returned . " A break in the traffic , I do n't know , " Moraghan answered . The para an shrugged , her face exhilarated . " That 's Mill Street , up ahead . " And that , Moraghan thought , as they turned onto the raw-metalled road that was the beginning of Mill Street , is all the answer I 'm likely to get . She glanced around , marveling at how much the narrowwindowedmills were like the factories of her own world , or any other world , for that matter . Gull said , " They tell me only a couple of them  --  Red Sheep , and the Ingvarr Co-operative  --  were around when I was born . The rest just sort of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wool . " She nodded toward a low-roofed building , where the double doors were padlocked and paint was peeling from the cheap siding . " That 's the Auction Hall . " Moraghan nodded back , staring at the ugly building . She had seen its twin on a dozen other worlds , the first real sign outside the port area of a link between Orestes and the rest of the Conglomerate . " Where is it we 're going ? " " Domas Rhawn 's , " Gull answered , and pointed toward a shacklikestructure wedged against a building labeled in bright letters " Hope Lane Mill . " " They say he was a miner , before he went into thep153wool trade , and lost an eye in a feud , too , before he started as a spinner with the Achias Mill . He makes good , cheap wool , though , and I need yarn for a heavy tunic . You know what that costs . " Moraghan nodded , though the para ' an 's words meant little to her . She knew that Guil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen the pilot 's workbasket empty of a project , but she herself had never done any sort of handwork . It was not something that fit well into the military life . Guil quickened her pace as she approached the staircase leading to the second-floor shop , and Moraghan had to hurry to keep up , the campaign bag slapping at her hip . At the top of the stairs , Guil paused to draw a deep breath , her face flushed with an excitement Moraghan did n't recognize . Then they stepped inside . The air smelled oddly musty  --  the scent of sheep 's wool , Moraghan thought , drawing on distant childhood memories . Beneath that was a pungent , pepper-and-lemon smell , and the sweet-sharp scent that filled Gull 's flat . Moraghan frowned , then remembered : tanna bark , to keep out the local insect life . Faintly through all that came the hot-oil smell of the machines . One stood immediately to the right of the door , idling gently , a strand of crimson yarn zigzagging through the wheels and eyes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one . On the walls beyond hung the finished yam . Moraghan smiled , impressed in spite of herself by the long skeins . The colors ranged from subtle , natural greys and browns to the muted shades that marked organic dyes , to clear and perfect primaries , with every shade and variation in between . One skein ranged through the spectrum in a length of yam no longer than her arm ; another , jetblackstrand , was wound with a thinner silver thread that glittered icily when the light hit it . The riot of color was matched by the variety of textures , ranging from coarse yarns as thick as her little finger to a cloudy , fraying stuff no thicker than sewing thread . And there was even more in the room beyond . . . . It was no wonder , Moraghan thought , that off-world clothiers came here . I 've never seen anything like this . " Guil ! Welcome ! " " Domas , " Guil answered , with more warmth than Moraghan had ever heard her use . " How 're things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the inner room moved like an old spider , Moraghan thought , shocked in spite of herself . He had never beenp154tall , by Oresteian standards , but some accident had left him bent almost double , one shoulder higher than the other . His head would barely reach Moraghan 's shoulder . One eye was obviously false  --  the colors were a bad match  --  and the hand he extended in greeting was missing a finger . " Well enough , thank you . " Domas made an odd , bobbing twist that let him look up into his customer 's face , and seemed to like what he saw there . His own face split into a wide smile . " What can I sell you today , Guil-pilot ? Cloud-mohair ? Gold-spun ? Shadow-light ? " Guil laughed . " Not likely , Domas . I need a new working pullover . " " For that , " Domas said , drawing the pilot after him into the inner room , " for that , I have hoobey yarn , dyed and plain , and some fine chunky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's very nice . . . " Guil gave Moraghan a quick , apologetic glance , and let herself be led away . Left to herself , the captain moved slowly along the walls , idly examining the hanks of yam . She felt distinctly out of place here , surrounded by the materials of a craft she had never bothered to understand . She stepped up to the doorway to the inner room , hoping to find Guil , but the only person in sight was a woman with a medium'sbadge pinned to her dress , knitting steadily behind the counter . Moraghan backed away noiselessly , and resigned herself to wait . It was n't long before Guil returned , a bulging bag slung carelessly over her shoulder . Domas followed , still talking , but Moraghan felt his eyes on her , recognizing and then dismissing her as off-world , and no customer . Gull came forward with an apologetic smile . " Sorry to keep you waiting . " " It 's all right , " Moraghan said . " What 'd you get ? " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realized she was genuinely curious . What had Guil chosen , out of all the yarns displayed here , and what would that choice tell her about the pilot ? Gull 's face changed , crinkling into laughter . " More than I 'd intended , as always . " She held open her bag . " The purple tweed , that 's for the pullover , but the carpet wool . . . . " She glanced mockingly at Domas , who returned an indulgent smile . " God only knows what I 'll make of it , but I could n't pass it up . " Moraghan nodded , almost understanding the other woman 's fascinationwith the yarns . The heathery purple was nice , a plain , practical color , but the other yarn was the color of flame . She touched it gently ,  |p155running  her fingers along the coarse strands . No , it would n't make for comfortable clothing , but it was too spectacular a color to pass up . " Maybe I 'll make a throw of it , " Guil was saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a weaver , but then I 'd have to get more  --  " She shook herself again , and laughed . " Come on , Leith , let 's get out of here before I buy anything else . " She pushed through the shop 's main door , still laughing , and Moraghan followed her down the narrow stairs . " We are n't that far from your flat , are we ? " Guil shook her head . " About a kilometer . Do you mind walking ? " " Anything 's better than the trams , " Moraghan answered . It was not a bad walk , with the heavy coat to cut the wind and the distant sunlight to give an illusion of warmth . The streets were busy , the market squares crowded with makeshift carts and stalls , as the shopkeepers moved to take advantage of the relatively warm weather . Moraghan was almost sorry when they turned off the High Street . Ahead , a line of jade-green stone knobs stretched across the roadway , marking the boundary of the Gilbertine Precinct and closingit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ street opened into the local market square . It was less noisy than the others had been , and there was an oddly wary note in the vendors ' cries . Moraghan tensed , not quite certain what she heard , and saw Guil shift the bag of yarn to her left hand . She glanced once around the square , and saw nothing out of the ordinary . A few shoppers , mostly older men and women , moved from stall to stall , occasionally vanishinginto one of the permanent stores that lined the square , only to reappear a few moments later with another packet tucked in their painted baskets . A knot of adolescents , their sleeves pinned with black and white ribbons , milled about outside the entrance to a sweetshop near the middle of the square , and Moraghan 's eyes narrowed . " Trouble ? " she asked softly , and Guil shrugged . " I doubt it , " the pilot said , but her voice was grimmer than her words . Moraghan grimaced , wishing her old service blaster were n't buried at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conscious effort , made herself relax . Gull was para'an , by their own rule outside the game , and she herself was obviously off-world . No one would bother them . They were even with the sweetshop now , and it was all Moraghanp156could do to keep her steps even and unconcerned . Guil was scowling , her hand white-knuckled on the neck of her sack of yarn . She looked neither to the right nor the left , and Moraghan copied her , matching the taller woman 's stride . " Hey , blondie ! " The shout came from behind them , from the crowd by the shop . Guil 's mouth twitched , but she did n't turn or give any other indicationshe had heard . Moraghan felt a tingling between her shoulder blades , the certainty that she was part of the target , but kept walking . " Hey , blondie ! " The voice was closer now , coming up on the right  --  Guil 's side , but there would be more behind him . Moraghan shifted her grip on the campaign bag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into an attacker 's stomach . Her strength and Orestes ' low gravity would make it an effective weapon . " Blondie ! Brandr bitch , what 're you doing here ? " The voice was very close , and Moraghan could hear the rest of his friends behind him . She started to turn , but before she could complete the move , Guil turned on them , right hand darting out like a striking snake . She caught the nearest boy by the collar of his tunic and dragged him forward until he stumbled and almost fell . Moraghan turned then , campaign bag sweeping out in a vicious arc that caught one boy in the stomach and sent him sprawling . The rest of the boys were already backing off , eyes fixed on the tug pilot . They were none of them older than sixteen , Moraghan thought , still poised , campaign bag swinging from her hand . Easy meat . Guil 's face was a fury 's mask , white-lipped and taut with anger . She shook the boy she held , then threw him bodily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stay on his feet . " My name is Tam'ne , " she said , very softly . The words carried in the sudden silence , and Moraghan saw a couple of the boys flinch . Para ' an of Tam'ne in Orillon . So I 'm not part of your fucking game . So stay the hell away from me . " She waited , balanced on the balls of her feet , staring at the boys . Moraghan swore softly , and caught the pilot by the shoulder , using her off-world strength to turn the other woman bodily away . Guil had silenced them for the moment , but in another minute the challengewould have been too much for their self-esteem , and they would have had to attack . Guil resisted for a second longer , and thenp157Moraghan felt the tension melt under her hand . Guil nodded sharply , and Moraghan let her hand fall away . No one followed them out of the square . Moraghan said nothing until they reached the door of Gull 's building , waiting until the rage eased from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else , less identifiable . Guil 's hand shook as she worked the lock . " What was all that about ? " Moraghan asked , less because she did n't know than to test the emotional waters . Guil snorted , and started up the stairs toward her third-floor flat . " The Halex punks thought I was a Brandr , " she called over her shoulder . Her voice was n't quite steady . " The Brandrs run to blonds . " " I 'm going to tell Trey about this , " Moraghan said quietly . Guil 's face darkened , and she pushed open the flat door with unnecessaryviolence . " I told you , I fight my own battles  --  " Moraghan held up a hand . " Let me finish , will you ? It 's for me  --  for all us off-worlders  --  not for you . Whether you report it , that 's your business , I do n't presume to know . But those kids attacked an offworlder , or they would 've , if you had n't stopped them . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking around the familiar , cosy main room , with its slit windows and heavy , padded furniture . " And , by the way , thanks . " Guil looked at the captain in honest confusion for a moment , then looked away , mouth twisting in an embarrassed grimace . " Thank you , " she said , after a moment . She sighed . " I 've got a bitch of a temper . I 'd 've done something really stupid . " Moraghan shrugged , herself embarrassed now . " So we 're even , then ? " Gull nodded , and managed a real smile . " We 're even , Leith . " She looked away , sighing , and gestured vaguely toward the cabinet that held her comnet console . " You 're welcome to use the ' net anytime . " Moraghan nodded back , and pushed aside the heavy fabric screen . Gull vanished into the flat 's inner rooms , her wool in one hand and Moraghan 's campaign bag slung awkwardly over her other shoulder , but the captain stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She had never seen Guil so angry , not even with Oslac  --  had never imagined that the pilot could be so angry , or could come so close to losing control . I do n't want to be there when she does lose it ,  |p158Moraghan  thought , and leaned forward to turn on the console . Gull 's all right for now , she told herself sternly . Now you need to tell Trey what 's going on . Sighing , she punched the string of numbers into the keyboard , setting herself to compose a rational report.  |p159Leith  called me from Destiny at a little after nineteen hours the eighteenth day of the tenth calendar-month . She told me first about rumors her para an friend had heard while acting as a substitute pilot in Madelgar  --  the same news we 'd already heard from Coronis  --  and then that she and Guil had been harassed by a group of Halex adolescents . From what she said , they were certainly old enough to have already pledged to obey the code , and I got good descriptions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day . It was too bad that Guil chose not to press her complaint , but attacking an off - worlder was quite enough . I had no patience for that sort of street brawling , and to tell the truth , I was glad of an excuse to crack down on it . I crawled into my bed that night feeling smugly virtuous : for once , I could use the code to get what I wanted . Four hours later , the Brandr attacked the Tower . The first dull crump of the mortars woke me , sent me groping for the light switch before I 'd fully realized what was happening . With the second , salvo came shouts from the hall outside my room  --  offworldaccents , mostly  --  and I shook myself completely awake . The clothes I 'd worn the day before lay on the storage box , and I grabbed them blindly , pulling on shirt and trousers and knitted tunic . The Tower lights flickered and died as I pulled on socks and boots , and I fumbled in momentary panic before I found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon as I 'd switched it on , and I breathed a sigh of relief . My relief was short-lived , however . The next salvo struck very close to the Tower , and my window shattered . If I had n't had the shades closed against the fading sun , the glass would have scythed through the room . I stood for a moment , staring stupidly at the thermalblinds , feeling the outside air cold on my face while the knowledgeseeped slowly through me that this was n't acting , that survival was n't just a matter of staying on the special-effects man 's marks . Then I heard , over the thump of the mortars , the whistle of blaster fire : the Halex were fighting back . I shook myself hard , trying to make my frozen brain work . I could n't take much , wherever I was going , but I would need my papers and bankcards . I scooped those up almost automatically , and reached for the medium 's badge as well , clipping it to the neck of my tunic . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would be Dark in twenty-four hours . I picked up the cloak Rohin had given me , and wrapped it around my shoulders . Another salvo shook the floors and sent dust and insulation drifting across the room , but still I hesitated , wondering what else I could take . There was nothing much here , a few tapes , some jewelry , all tucked away in the storage cells along the walls . Nothing worth dying for , I thought , and pushed open the door into the hall . The few off-worlders who had n't left with the Patroclans were all out in the hall now . Family members pushed past without stopping , blasters slung over their shoulders . They would be heading up to the roof ports , I guessed , or down to the doors to try to set up a perimeter defense . " Trey ! " The voice was n't familiar at first , despite the Urban speech . I turned , and saw Pausha Ran standing in the doorway of her suite of rooms . I had n't had much contact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be in the back country , running clinics , when I was in the Tower  --  but the sight of her standing there , fully dressed , clutching her emergency kit in one hand and her ten-year-old daughterwith the other , was oddly reassuring . " Where do we go ? " I spread my hands , but said , " Down , I assume  --  it should be safer there . " I saw one of the Agnian technicians still in his nightshift , and resigned myself to taking charge . " All right , everybody , listen to me.  |p161Get  some clothes on , quick , get your ID and bring an overcoat , somethingwarm , and follow me . " The Agnian vanished back into his room , and the talk quieted abruptly as people began to move purposefully again . Dr. Ran bit at her upper lip , pulling her daughter close against her body . " I 'll be needed , Trey , " she said , so quietly that I almost did n't hear her over the noise of the fighting . I nodded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safe place  --  you could n't treat them , otherwise . We 'll get Anila downstairs , then we 'll see . " She nodded back , obviously reassured , and I felt terribly helpless . I had no idea what the Halex planned to do  --  I had no business taking charge of anything . " Medium ! " That was a Halex voice , Rohin ' s voice , and I turned gladly , eager to hand over the responsibility . " This way ! " He pointed to a side stair , a fixed stair that led down to the kitchens . I nodded , then put two fingers in my mouth and whistled . " All right , everybody , we 're going , " I shouted . The last words were drowned out by an explosion that rocked the Tower on its foundations and nearly knocked me from my feet . The girl Anila shrieked once , and clutched her mother ; someone shouted curses in a distant room . Rohin made a face . " That was an outbuilding , " he said . " Come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I shouted , and this time I was obeyed . " Follow Robin ! " The Demi-heir started down the stairs without waiting for further word , and this time the off-worlders followed . I hung back , counting , trying to make sure no one was left behind . The four Agnians , the little visiting artist from Osiris , Dr. Ran and her daughter , the Methusalan teacher . . . . That was the last of them , and I darted after , suddenly aware that the air was full of dust and odd-tasting smoke , and that the emergency lights were fading fast . I switched on my handlight halfway down the stairs , and saw two more lights bobbingahead of me . Rohin had one and Dr. Ran , not surprisingly , had the other . By the time we reached the kitchen , the emergency lights were gone completely . Rohin beckoned with his light , and we groped our way through the maze of tables and equipment , to fetch up against a white-enameled door . It looked like the hatch of an ordinary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Rohin fumbled with its latch that it was something more . " Give me some light , " he snapped , and Dr. Ran directed the beam of her handlight onto his hands . I did the same , the circles merging , and an instant later Robin gave a grunt of satisfaction . There was a heavy click , then the groan of counterweights and pulley wheels , and the entire locker pivoted slowly , revealing a flat trapdoor . Light outlinedits edges : someone was already down there . Rohin made anothersatisfied noise , and lifted the trap  --  it was lighter than it looked , and the hinges were freshly oiled  --  saying , " Alkres , I 've brought the off - worlders . " There was a breathy exclamation , too soft to be heard , and then a boy 's voice said , " All right . We 're all here . " " Good . " Robin straightened , and swung his handlight , catching each of us for an instant in its beam . " This is the Tower 's escape tunnel . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ostlaer , about a kilometerfrom Federston . Herself does n't want to take any chances with people not of the Family . Please go on , now . " His words had a rehearsed ring to them , the sound of official news rather than of truth . I gave him a sharp glance , and he put a hand on my arm . " Hang back a minute , Trey , " he said , very softly . " And you , too , Dr. Ran . " The others were already climbing down the steep , ladder-like stairs into the tunnel . I waited , watching Rohin . Dr. Ran sent Anila down the ladder  --  an Agnian steadied her from below  --  then straightened and turned to face the Demi-heir . " Well ? " she demanded , but softly . Rohin took a deep breath . " Herself 's sent the kids out , too , " he said , and this time I knew he was telling the unshaped truth . " Alkres  --  he 's the ult'eir  --  is in charge of them , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trey . Please , both of you , Herself asks that you take care of the kids . " " But my duty to the wounded , " Dr. Ran said , on a note of pain . " My duty  --  " " We have doctors , " Rohin said . " It 's the kids who really need you . " " You ca n't hold the Tower ? " I asked , though I already knew the answer . Robin shrugged , and somehow managed a ghost of his usual smile . " Anything 's possible , Medium , but it does n't look good . "  |p163The  smile vanished abruptly as another explosion shook the Tower , and I said , " We 'd better be going . Tell Herself we 'll do as she asks . " Dr. Ran nodded , her eyes full of tears , and slid down the ladder into the tunnel . I started to follow , and Rohin said , " Trey , tell Rehur  --  " He stopped and shook his head , smiling again . " Never mind , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . I started down the ladder , and Rohin lowered the trapdoor over me . As I reached the bottom , I heard the groan of the counterweights , and knew that the Demi-heir was moving the locker back into place over the trap . " Medium ? " I turned my handlight on the speaker . He was a slight , dark boy of about fifteen , who wore tunic and trousers over an embroidered nightshirt : the ult'eir Alkres , who might well be the Halex Patriarch before clock-morning . There were more children , all younger than he , behind him . Fifteen counted as adult on Orestes . I wondered , irrelevantly , how he felt about being sent off like this , or if he recognized the necessity . " Alkres ? " I said , more out of politeness than because I was n't sure , and the boy nodded . " We 'd better be going , " he said , and pointed down the tunnel with his own light . " Right , " I said . " If you 'll lead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All right , " Alkres agreed . He glanced at the off-worlders , most of whom carried handlights of their own . " We should save the lights , though . I 'll take one , and you take one , Medium , and one in the middle  --  " " Dr. Ran , " I said . She nodded and moved on up the tunnel , pulling Anila with her , until she was in the center of the group. "  --  and everybody else turn theirs off until we say , " Alkres finished . It was a good idea , something I probably wouldn't 've thought of . I nodded again , and Alkres turned away , pushing past first the offworldersand then his younger relatives , until he was at the head of the line . One by one , reluctantly , the rest of us dimmed our lights , until only three were lit . Alkres gave a soft whistle , and we started to move . After the first twenty meters , the tunnel narrowed abruptly , becoming a rough-drilled tube barely high enough for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by Oresteian standards , but even so , I had to duck occasionally to avoid lumps of harder rock that the drill had left behind . The tunnel was so narrow that I could n't hold my arms out straight from the shoulder and we had to walk single file . Even so , I swept my torch back and forth ahead of me , making sure none of the children had somehow fallen behind . Anythingwas better than thinking about the Tower , and the people we 'd left behind . Robin , Corol , Jesma , Ixora , even Herself  --  and all the parents of the children who walked so silently ahead of me . . . . If the Tower did not hold , God only knew what would happen to them . I closed my mind to those fears and kept walking , sweeping the light ahead of me . We walked for an interminable time through the unchanging tunnel . At some point  --  I had somehow left my timepiece back at the Tower , and refused to ask what time it was  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Later still , we took turns carrying the littlest ones . Then , at long last , the tunnel twisted like a snake , doubling back on itself , and narrowed even further , so that I had to crawl and even the smallest children had to stoop , and we came out into a broader cave , with sunlight showing at the far end . One of the children gave a short whoop of delight , quickly hushed , and we all hurried for the opening . It was heavily overgrown , and most of us were marked with bleeding scratches by the time we 'd fought our way through the rough-barked vines . As Robin had said , the tunnel mouth opened on a broad ledge halfway up the Ostlaer cliffs . The slope down to the river itself was steep , but manageable even with the children . Almost before I 'd made a conscious decision , I slid down the bank to the water 's edge , looking up and down the river . The current was dangerously fast here , as it was for almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground at the base of the cliff was easily wide enough to walk on . It stayed wide as far as I could see , and I turned back to the group on the cliff . " Which way 's Federston ? " Alkres pointed downstream . His voice came back very thin and high . " About a kilometer , I think , or a little more . " It was a long way for the children to walk , especially after the interminable trip through the escape tunnel , but I did n't particularly like the idea of leaving them behind while one of the adults wentp165ahead for transport . If the worst had happened , and the Brandr had patrols out looking for stray Halex  --  well , it seemed a bad risk . And if the kids walked to Federston on top of everything else they 'd done , at least they 'd be tired enough to sleep without worrying about their families . " Doctor ? " I called , and Dr. Ran slid down the cliff to join me . Her round face was scratched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the tip , the coarse strands fraying . " Do you think the kids can walk to Federston from here ? " She nodded slowly , worrying at her tail of hair . " They 're a tough bunch , and we can carry the little ones . " She looked up then , meeting my eyes . " I think you 're right , Trey . " It took us over an hour to reach Federston , arriving at just past five hours of the clock-morning , according to the Methusalan 's chronometer . The town was small , barely more than support facilities for the UHST station , with only one metalled street and no airfield . There were lights on in most of the houses , but nothing moved in the single street . Still , I was aware of eyes watching us from behind slitted thermal blinds , and shifted the five-year-old I had been carrying on my hip since we left the cave . She made a noise of protest , and I soothed her , hoping she would n't decide to start crying . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that would have melted armor plate , and I said , hastily , " Do you know the foreman here ? " The ult'eir shook his head . " No , but that 's his house . " I looked in the direction he was pointing . The house stood next to the UHST station , but was separated from it by a woven fence half covered with some sort of flowering vine . It had a broader porch than the other houses , and a carved door with an imposing knocker : clearly the place belonged to someone of importance . " He 's an Ansson , " Alkres went on . " Most of the UHST people are Anssons . " " Oh , " I said . I could only hope that bit of knowledge would be useful someday . Then we were at the foot of the steps that led up to the porch , and Alkres turned , holding up his hand . " All of you , please wait here . Medium , if you 'd come with me ? " I heard the echo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to bite back tears . " Of course , " I said , and was relieved that my voice wasp166reasonably steady . I climbed the steps behind Alkres , and put myself at his left as he pressed the elaborate knocker . The door opened almost instantly , and 1 knew the foreman had been watching us since we entered the town . Alkres said , " I 'm sorry to disturb you so early , sor , but I plead urgent Family business . I am Alkres Halex . " The foreman , the first really heavy man I 'd seen on Orestes , threw the door open wide . " Come in , sor , come in  --  all of you , please . I 'm Ruland Ansson , foreman of this town . " We followed Ruland into the main room of the house , and dropped onto the chairs and benches without waiting for his invitation . I was suddenly overcome with weariness , and leaned back against the wall behind the narrow bench . It seemed almost indecent to be so comfortable , and infinitely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closed my eyes . The next thing I knew , the room was striped with sunlight , and Alkres was saying , " Is there any news ? " Frightened , I stole a glance at the Methusalan 's timepiece : I 'd only been asleep for a few minutes , but still , I did n't dare stay seated . I pulled myself to my feet and went to join Alkres , hoping no one had noticed my lapse . Ruland shook his head , including me in the conversation with a glance . " No , sor , nothing beyond what you 've told us . All we knew was , we lost the ' net link with the Tower , and then we heard the fighting . " He looked deliberately at me , and added , " Someone 'll have to be sent . " I grimaced , but nodded . He was right  --  someone would have to go and survey the damage for themselves , and I , as a medium and thus theoretically inviolate , was the logical person to send . But I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't think you should go , Trey . " That was Dr. Ran , coming up behind us with her bag slung over her shoulder . She had treated the worst of the cuts and scratches as soon as we reached the foreman 's house , without the slightest break , and still did n't look tired . I thought I envied her . Ruland raised an eyebrow at her , and Alkres said , " Why not ? " " Because Trey 's not a doctor , " Ran answered . " Send me ; I can maybe do some good , as well as letting you know what 's happened . "  |p167She  touched her emergency bag as though it were a talisman . " There 're people up there who 'll need a doctor . " Alkres said , " All right . " His voice was less certain than it had been before . Ruland nodded thoughtfully . " I can send our flyer and a portable comnet , " he offered . " I could go along , too , " I said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here . " Ruland said , " You might be better monitoring the ' net , at that , Medium . " He gave me a speaking glance , and I understood . The code still had to be observed . If a ghost tried to contact the ult'eir , I would have to take the call . Federston was too small a place to have a medium of its own . I said , " You 're right , both of you . I 'll stay . " " I 'll send my boy for the flyer , " Ruland said . " Teacher and my wife can look after the kids . " The next hours remain a blurred memory . Dr. Ran raided the UHST station 's medical kit , and then vanished . Some time later , we heard the throbbing beat of the flyer 's old-fashioned rotors . The children , exhausted , slept fitfully , except for Alkres and one or two othersold enough to understand what might have happened . Ruland 's wife , Ulrika , and the young man who ran the town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him except " Teacher "  --  moved among them , encouraging them to rest . The off - worlders huddled together , not talking much . Anila Ran and the Methusalan drew a patterned square on a piece of scrap paper , and played some simple board game over and over again . They moved the stones that served for counters very gingerly , afraid of noise . At some point in the interminable morning , the comnet technician appeared in the doorway and beckoned to Ruland . They spoke for a few moments , low-voiced so as not to disturb the sleeping children , and then Ruland waved for me to join them . " The ' net 's up again , " the technician said , without preliminary , " but I ca n't raise the Tower . I thought you might ought to listen in , Medium , just in case . " I nodded , and looked over my shoulder to find Alkres . The ult'eir was asleep at last , curled in what was probably Ruland 's favorite chair . Ruland saw the direction of my glance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Medium , when he wakes up . "  | " Thanks , " I said , and followed the technician out of the foreman 's house and across the dusty strip of ground to the UHST station . The comnet office was bigger than I 'd expected , but then I realized it must serve the town as well as the UHST line . The technician led me through the glass-walled outer office and into the smaller , warmer room where the machines themselves were kept . Lights glowed green and orange across the multiple consoles , and the technician gave his boards a quick , practiced glance before waving me to the couch that stood against the room 's third wall . " This line 's programmed to keep searching for the Tower signal , " he said , gesturing to one of the rows of lights , " and I 've kept another three open to any signals on the emergency frequencies . I 've got anotherfive lines I can use to call the other towns around here , and that still leaves one line free for UHST business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but if faded quickly . " I thought I 'd call Asten and Monas Major , for starters . " " Go ahead , " I said , and leaned back against the couch 's cushions . I was dead tired , after only four hours ' sleep and the attack ; I could feel myself slipping into a doze , and was powerless to stop it . I heard the technician talking to his fellows at the other UHST stations to the south and west of the Tower , but their words registered only as vague impressions , surreal images of fear and uncertainty . No one on the UHST link knew much more than we did at Federston . Monas Major , just south of the Tower , had heard explosions and seen flames , but their foreman had forbidden anyone to investigate until she was sure the fighting was over  --  a sensible decision , but a frustrating one . Nansivi ' , on the main line to the north , had heard a lot of air traffic , but had known nothing of the fighting that followed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brandrs taking over the port , but was cut off before the technician could clear the line . The Tower station did not answer our technician 's calls , and there was still no word from Dr. Ran . I drifted into deeper sleep , broken only by confused dreams . " Medium ! " The technician 's voice jolted me awake , and I reachedinstinctively for the room controls before I remembered where I was . " I 've got the doctor , " the technician went on , oblivious to my confusion , and twisted a knob that sent sound pouring into the room . "  --  Federston Station . Please respond . "  |p169It  was unquestionably Dr. Ran 's voice , driving the last vestiges of sleep from my brain . " This is Federston Station , " the technician answered smoothly . With his free hand , he gestured frantically toward a switch marked " Foreman 's House . " I pressed it , and he nodded , saying , " We are onlink , Doctor . What 's your message ? " " Things  --  things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not quite steady , and I could feel my own muscles tense in answer . " The Tower is almost destroyed , and I have not found any survivors or any signs of survivors . There has been a fire ; I assume there are bodies in the rubble . " The door opened then , and Ruland came in , breathing heavily . Alkrespushed past him without a word of apology , but the foreman made no complaint . " What  --  ? " the ult'eir began , and broke off with a visible effort , watching the technician . " Bad news , " I said , quietly . " The Tower 's burned . " " Oh , my God , " Ruland said . Alkres said nothing , but I saw his hands tighten slowly on the hem of his tunic . " Doctor , can you give us a picture ? " the technician was saying . " Please ask Vereck to transmit a picture . " There was a moment 's silence , and then Ran said , " All right . " The technician @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ central screen . The display board beneath it flickered , numbers shifting , and then steadied . Slowly , an image began to take shape on the screen above . The technician made another adjustment , and the picture sharpened abruptly . It took me a minute to recognize what was left of the Tower . The upper floors were gone , and one corner seemed to have been completelyblown away , so that only a slanted stub remained of the originalbuilding . Smoke still curled from the stone , but it was clear that the fire was almost out . Alkres gave a single cry of protest , but did not look away . The ' net crackled , and Dr. Ran said , " Federston Station , I think you should contact the neighboring towns  --  and the nearest Branch Holders  --  tosee if any survivors were brought there . " Ruland leaned forward so that his voice would reach the microphones . " I 'll do that , Doctor . " " There 's not much I can do here , by the look of it , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , and make a closer search for survivors or bodies . " Her voice faltered a little on the last word , and Alkres made a soft , unhappy noise of agreement . " Very good , Doctor , " the technician said , his voice professionally imperturbable . " I acknowledge end of transmission . " " Transmission ends , " Ran echoed , and the dreadful picture faded from the screen . No one said anything for a long moment . Alkres was still staring at the blank screen , his long mouth compressed into a tight , miserable line . I wanted very much to take him in my arms , to tell him everything would be all right after all , but I knew better than to offer that false comfort . Ruland cleared his throat , working his shoulders like a man who 's been doing heavy labor . " Doctor 's right , " he said , too loudly . " Hastain , call around , see if any of the other townships 've picked up survivors . " The technician said , " Sor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " So try outside the UHST link , " Ruland said . " Then  --  The nearest Holder 's Yslin Rhawn . Raise the Hold , and see what they say . " " Yes , sor . " Hastain turned back to his machines , typing instructions into the boards . " How could this 've happened ? " Alkres asked . " The Tower 's supposedto be proof against attacks . " Ruland heaved a great sigh . " I do n't know , sor . I 'd guess most of the damage was done after the fighting ended  --  explosive charges set on the upper floors , or maybe incendiaries . " He had spoken to Alkres as one adult to another , and the boy knew it . I saw the ult'eir straighten his shoulders , visibly putting aside his own fear and grief . Ruland saw it , too , but gave no sign , continuing gruffly , " But , with all respect , sor , I do n't think it matters right now . What 's important is what 's to be done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nodded . " That 's right . " He stopped there , and I said , " The children must have kin outside the mainline Family . It might be best to send them to those relatives  --  maybe Dr. Ran could oversee that ? " Ruland nodded thoughtfully , but he was careful to wait until Alkreshad murmured his agreement before continuing . " And then there 're the off-wonders to deal with . " " I think I ought to release them from my service , " Alkres said . His firmness surprised me , until I remembered the holoplay Meriban . Thep171heroine 's first act , after she 's been deprived of her station , is to release her long-suffering servants from their contracts , though most of them , of course , choose to remain with her . There are several other plays that use the same motif . Allcres was following the models he knew best . I did n't have the heart to tell him that most of the offworlderswould be only too grateful to be able to leave him . " If you decide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appropriate , " I said , " I trust you 'll let me stay until things are settled . " After all , I could hardly leave Alkres  --  who was only a fifteen-year-old boy  --  to manage on his own ; I would at least see him safely into the hands of his relatives before I decided what I would do . And I might yet be of some use : Conglomerate Mediators are trained to salvage the most unpromising situations , and in the confusion , someone might be willingto let me try . " Thank you , " Alkres said . He shivered suddenly . " Do I have to proclaim myself the Patriarch ? " That was another idea straight from the holoplays ; the trouble was , those plays reflected the code . I hesitated , knowing why the boy wanted to wait . He was hoping , as we all were , that somehow someoneelse  --  Rohin , Magan , Alkres 's own mother the pent'eir , Herself , anyone  --  had survived and would take the responsibility from him . Still , it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head of the Kinship . I looked at Ruland , and saw the same conflict in his face . I said , feeling my way , " I think you have to let the Kinship know you 're alive , at least . I do n't know if you ought to do anything else until we know more about what 's happened . " Ruland looked relieved . " That makes sense . " Alkres nodded , but before he could say anything else , the techniciansaid , " Sors . I 'm not getting any answer from the southern settlements , but I 'm picking up a general broadcast from the Rhawn Hold . Shall I put it on ? " " Yes ! " Alkres said , and I saw his hands close again on the hem of his tunic , twisting the fabric into a knot . Hastain did something to his controls , and a booming voice filled the room . He winced , and adjusted the volume . Even then , I did n't recognize the voice , but the words were clear enough. "  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brandr raiders . As no member of the mainline Family survived , itp172falls to me , as senior Holder of the Kinship , to take control . In view of the statement issued by the Brandr Patriarch , I ask  --  I order  --  the Kinship to take no action until and unless I approve it . " The voice , Yslin Rhawn 's , faded in a hiss of static , then began again . " Members of the Halex Kinship , our Kinship Tower was attacked . . . . " " That 's not true , " Alkres shouted . " Ruland , Medium , you have to tell him I 'm alive . " " Statement ? " I said , in almost the same moment . " What state-ment ? " Hastain had slipped on a pair of headphones and was working busily at his controls . Then he stopped , shaking his head , and pushed the headphones back off his ears . " It just repeats , sors , and I ca n't raise anyone at the Hold . Shall I keep trying ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a glance at Alkres . " You 're right , Medium , we need that statement . Do a broad-scan , Hastain , or try Destiny , but get me a hard copy of that , and of Yslin Rhawn 's little speech . Bring them to me in my office . And send the doctor in as soon as she gets back . " He gave Alkres a grim look . " Sors , we need to talk in private . " Alkres let himself be drawn , unresisting , back to the foreman 's house . Inside , Ulrika took one look at the boy 's set , white face , and insisted on bringing us a coffee service . Ruland growled at her for wasting time , but the hot drink , and the food that came with it , seemed to bring a little color back to Alkres 's face . A few minutes later , Hastain appeared , carrying several sheets of green-striped paper . Ruland took it , flipped through the closely printed pages , and grunted . " Where 'd you get it ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ main ' net station , " Hastain answered . " They 're overriding any private communicationswith it . " " Smart of them , " Ruland growled . He flipped the sheets across the desk . " What do you make of it , Medium ? " I caught the papers , and turned them so that Alkres could see as well . It was a long document , two pages of close printing , but stripped of the code 's elaborate phrases , the meaning was all too clear . The Brandr Patriarch freely acknowledged both that his Kinshipand the Fyfe Kinship had combined to attack the Halex Tower , and that they had used off-world weaponry to do so . This was , hep173said , admittedly a drastic measure , but one that was made necessary by the Halex Matriarch 's constant attempts to overturn the code by which Oresteians lived . He used the same argument to justify the destruction of the Tower , and then went on to say that , because the code-breakers were a minority in the Kinship , and almost exclusively of the mainline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and to recognize the Rhawn as legitimate head of the Kinship . I read the statement twice , and then a third time , as though another examinationmight change the meaning . " He ca n't do that , " Alkres said . There were tears in his eyes , and he shook them angrily away . " It 's not true , what he said about Herself , and even if it were , he ca n't do this . I 'm still head of the Kinship  --  are n't I ? " " It 's completely against the code , " Ruland said . " True enough , " I said , " but it sounds like Yslin 's listening . I wonderhow many of the other Holders will listen , too ? " " They 'd better not , " Alkres muttered , then seemed to recognize the futility of his words and subsided , scowling , into his chair . " Hastain , " I said , slowly , " see if you can raise the other Holders . Let them know that the ult'eir 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If they ask how you know , say you 've heard from people who 've seen him , something like that , but do n't let them know he 's in Federston . I think it 's enough to start a rumor , at this point , and a lot less risky . " " You 're really expecting trouble , " Ruland said . " Are n't you ? " I snapped , and was instantly sorry I 'd spoken so sharply . The foreman did n't seem angry , however . He nodded slowly . " I think you 're right . The whole system 's gone to hell . " More information trickled in over the next few hours . Dr. Ran returned at last , but she reported finding no survivors . There were bodies in the ruin , she said , but they were so badly charred that she could n't identify them without special equipment . She had left them there , and come back to Federston in the hope we 'd heard something from the neighboring towns . We had n't . Hastain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and then Ruland managed to contact the Ansson and Ingvarr Holders , but there were no reports of any survivors . I wonderedbitterly if the Brandr had made sure there would be none , but shied away from mentioning the possibility aloud . It might not bep174true , after all ; the code expressly forbade that kind of killing  --  but the Brandr had already shattered the spirit of the code , if not its letter . Why should they hesitate at wholesale slaughter ? The worst thing of all , for me , was that I was sure the Brandr Patriarch believed everything he 'd said in his statement , and would stand by it to the death . As I 'd suggested , Ruland passed on the word of Alkres ' s survival to the other Holders , couching it as a secondhand report . The response was not particularly encouraging from Asbera Ingvarr  --  her Hold lay closest to the Rhawns , and was not easily defensible  --  but Barthel Ansson expressed cautious pleasure . Over my objections , Ruland informed him of the other children waiting in Federston @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at once . I still did n't like it  --  after all , admitting that we had the only known group of survivors was tantamount to admitting that we had Alkres  --  but I had to see the force of Ruland 's arguments . The children did need to be with their own families , especially now , and it would be easier to arrange that from the Ansson Hold . Dr. Ran and the Methusalan agreed to go with them , and stay at the Hold until all the children were relocated . The other off-worlders , understandably , demanded to be sent to Destiny , and Alkres agreed . That left only the question of what was to be done with the ult'eir . Ruland thought he should proclaim himself Patriarch and see what sort of support he gathered , while Dr. Ran argued that he should go with the other children to the Ansson Hold . I could n't feel happy about that , and even Ruland , himself an Ansson , had to admit that , with things so unsettled , it was probably unwise for Alkres @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Family . Reports kept coming in of resistance in Destiny  --  the Ingvarr stadtholder simply would not acknowledge the Brandr Patriarch , while port workers refused to service Brandr ships  --  and I wondered if it would n't be best to take Alkres there . After all , the city had benefited as much as the southern Holdings from the Matriarch 's reforms , and the city-dwellerswere n't directly under the Branch-Holders ' thumbs . Alkres might well find a core of solid support there , and , if all else failed , he would be close enough to the spaceport to get off-world . Alkres made no contribution to the discussion , sunk in understandable apathy . When we asked directly what he wanted to do , he said only that he had always liked Asbera Ingvarr , and lapsed again into silence . We werep175still arguing the question when one of the UHST station 's runners burst into the office . " I 'm sorry , sors , ama , but Hastain says there 're Branch flyers headingthis way . " Ruland shot to his feet . " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a girl maybe three or four years older than Alkres , caught her breath with an effort . " He 's picked up their transmission , sor , on a military band , about twenty-five kilometers to the south-west . " Ruland and I exchanged glances . The Rhawn Hold lay to the southwest of Federston , but so did the Ansson holding . " They must 've picked up our transmission to the Ansson Hold , " Dr. Ran said , guiltily . " You were right , Trey . We never should 've told them the children were here . " " Nothing so easy , " Ruland growled . I said , " The ' net is supposed to be shielded . They couldn't 've interceptedthe call ; someone had to tell them we were here . " " Like Barthel Ansson , " Ruland said bitterly . He shook himself . " Jannah , tell Hastain to go on the ' speaker and warn the town . Tell Teacher to take all the kids into the school basement , that 's the safest place I can think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . " The girl nodded and darted off . Ruland turned back to me . " Medium , we 'll have to do it your way . Take the flyer ; I 'll tell them it 's in Monas Major for repairs . You take Himself into Destiny . He should be safe there . " I nodded , and looked to Alkres . The ult'eir  --  the Patriarch , now  --  was sitting very straight in his chair , hands folded tightly in his lap . He saw me looking at him , and managed a nod . " All right , Medium , I 'll do what you say . " He looked at Ruland . " Thank you , foreman , for taking care of us . I just hope  --  " His face crumpled , but he mastered himself and went on , bravely , " I hope you do n't get into trouble for what you 've done . I wo n't forget it . " Ruland touched his forehead . " My duty , sor . " The door snapped open again , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , my furred cloak and a child 's coat in her arms . A battered satchel swung from one hand . " Sor , " the girl said , " the flyer 's outside , and Hastain says they 're coming fast . "  | " Right , let 's go , " Ruland said . He stopped abruptly , an appalled expression on his face , " Medium , you can fly  --  " " I can handle a flyer , " I said . " Come on . " We left the foreman 's house in a clump , Ruland 's wife bundling Alkres into the coat as we walked , me shrugging my cape haphazardlyonto my shoulders . Ruland handed me the satchel , telling me it held food and money , and I slung it across my shoulder , muttering my thanks . I had no gloves  --  the scarlet gloves that matched the cloak 's trim were ashes now  --  but at least the cabin would be heated . In the street outside , Teacher was herding a last group of children into the schoolhouse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noise almost drowned by the thunder of the flyer 's engine . Vereck had taxied the machine from its shed up the main street of town , and held it now directly in front of the station . He popped the canopy as we approached , and I scrambled up and into the pod , fitting myself behind the pilot 's board . When he was sure I had control , Vereck levered himself out of the machine , pausing on the edge of the pod to help Alkres aboard , then dropped free . There was no time for farewells . As the others ran for the shelter of the foreman 's house , I fed power to the engine , touching the rudder pedals to swing the ship so that we faced down the metalled street . I glanced quickly across the boards , recognizing with relief the red handle of a quick-start booster , and asked , " Clear ? " " All clear , " Alkres answered , twisting in his seat to survey the street around us . I took him at his word , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up speed as we went . Then I pulled the booster handle , and we shot forward , almost catapulted into the air . Sixty meters up , still well under the usual scanner canopy , I trimmed ship , and banked onto the line of the UHST tracks , heading flat out for Destiny . The flight into Destiny was an anticlimax after all . There was no sign of pursuit , even when I lifted the flyer into a normal traffic lane , and no signs of disaster behind us . Still , I followed the UHST line north to the station town of Newforest , and left the flyer at the field there . The local trains were running again , as I 'd hoped they would be . We joined a crowd of locals , mostly mill workers , at the station , and caught the next train into Destiny 's south terminal . There were guards in Brandr battledress at the station barriers ,  |p177along  with the usual policemen . I knew the dark-haired man at the left-hand barrier , and turned in that direction . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along bodily . " Act natural , " I whispered . " You 're my son ; we 're off-world workerswho 've left Halex service . " I glanced quickly over him , seeing nothing that would immediately betray us , and was glad my medium'sbadge was hidden beneath my cloak . Alkres was dark-haired , but at least he had n't grown into the hawk-boned Halex face . Only the Oresteian accent would betray him , and that only if he spoke . " Let me do the talking , " I said , and gave his hand what I hoped was a reassuring squeeze . Alkres returned the pressure , but his face was very pale . We were coming up on the barrier now , and I pulled out the double ticket , holding it out for the ticket counter . She took it without a word and nodded us through , but the nearest Brandr said , " Hold it . Let 's see your IDs . " I let my Urban accent thicken . " We do n't have any ID , thanks to you people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Name ? " Both the Brandr were watching us now , hands on the slings of their blasters . " Mas Zeeman . " I jerked my head at Alkres . " That 's my son , Tannis . " I had pulled the name out of nowhere , and a characterization with it . Zeeman was an engineer , irascible , bull-headed , and thoroughlyfed up with the whole situation . It was an easy part , for all that it was deadly serious . I glowered at the nearer Brandr , waiting for an answer . The dark-haired policeman eyed me impassively and said , " I know them , they 're all right . They come through all the time . " By now , there was a small crowd backed up behind us , waiting to get through the barrier , and I could hear rumblings of discontent . The Brandr heard it , too , and exchanged wary glances . One said , " All right , you can pass . " I nodded grudgingly , staying in character , and pushed through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ satisfaction rippled through the crowd . Buoyed by the sound , I did n't start shaking until we reached the street outside . I saw Alkres looking at me , and said roughly , " I have a friend  --  she 's captain of the six-week mailship . We 'll go to her place , no one 'll trace us there . "  | " All right , " Alkres said , in a small voice . He was looking very young , and very tired , and I made myself relax a little . " Actually , it 's not her flat  --  it belongs to a friend of hers , a pars an . Do n't worry , though , I know they 'll help us . " I knew I was babbling , but the flow of words seemed to help . " We 'll have to walk , I 'm afraid . I do n't think we ought to risk the trams . " " I can make it , " Alkres said grimly . We reached the address Leith had given me  --  was it only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There were n't many people on the street , and I felt very conspicuous as we made our way along Bluestar Street , glancing at building numbers as we went . I was very glad to duck into the sheltered doorway of Guil ex-Tam'ne 's flat . The outer door was locked , of course , but there was a standard guardbox beside the latch . I pressed the code sequence Leith had given me , and waited . Nothing happened , and I pressed it again , hoping they had not decided to go out for the evening . It was still Light , and would be for another six hours , so the businesses in the Necropolis were closed , and I could n't imagine Leith choosing to leave a comnet at a time like this . Unless , I thought , with a sudden rush of fear , she had already gone back to the ship ? I raised my hand to press the buttons again , and the speaker crackled to life . " Who is it ? " It was the para ' an 's wary voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's Trey , Trey Maturin . I 'm looking for Leith . May I come in ? " There was a muffled exclamation , and then Leith said , " Of course . " A moment later , the door clicked open . We stepped through , and started up the stairs toward Gull 's flat . Leith was waiting in the open doorway , Gull 's fair hair just visible behind her . She frowned , seeing Alkres , and I said hastily , " Let me get inside first , Leith , please . " Moraghan 's frown deepened , but she stepped aside wordlessly , and let us into the flat . It was a fairly large place , with several rooms ; the living room where we stood was larger than Rehur 's entire flat . Then Leith had closed the door behind us , saying " What the hell 's going on ? " " I know what 's going on , " Guil said . She fixed me with an icy stare , daring me to contradict her . " That 's the Halex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him , and your medium 's brought him here . " I shook my head , and managed a smile . " You 're only partly right , Guil . He 's not the ult'eir anymore , he 's the Patriarch . And there is n't any other place for us to go . " " He 's got kin , " the para'an protested , mechanically . I said , " They ca n't be trusted . Have you heard the broadcasts coming out of the Rhawn Hold ? " " Yes , " Leith said . " And the Brandr s . " She glared at the pars an , who looked away , shrugging . " It 's not my place , Leith , " she muttered . Then , as Moraghan 's stare did not waver , Guil said , " All right , I 'm with you . But the whole thing 's fucked up . " Leith said , with the quiet competence that had always drawn me to her , " What can we do , Trey ? " I paused , marshalling my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of getting Alkres out of reach of the Brandr . " Mainly , we need a place to hide until things sort themselves out a little . " Leith nodded . " You got it . " Guil nodded , too , but her expression was unreadable . " After that , " I said , " we 'll need to get in touch with the Family , let them know that Alkres is alive and claims the genarchy . I do n't know what , then . " Leith circled her gloved wrist with the fingers of her right hand , turning the maimed arm thoughtfully in their circle . She was wearing an oversized Oresteian tunic , probably borrowed from Guil , over her usual clothes , but she stood as straight as if she still wore her Peacekeeper 's uniform . " All right , " she said abruptly . " You need communications . You ca n't use Gull 's ' net except in emergencies : the link might be traced , and that would spoil the safe house . We 'll go to Pipe Major . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Something Leith had said once was echoing in my mind , something about it not mattering whether an order was right or wrong as long as a decision was made . I said , " Do n't play the commander with me , Leith . " She looked up , startled and angry , and then , reluctantly , her expressioneased into a smile . " I was n't , Trey , truth . If it 's communicationsyou need , Pipe Major 's your best bet . " " It could still be traced , " Guil said.  |p180Leith  shrugged . " So what ? Do you think even these Brandr are going to risk harassing a Conglomerate mailship ? " " The way things are going , " Alkres said , " I would n't put anything past them . " It was the first time he 'd spoken since we 'd entered the flat , and everybody jumped . Guil was the first to recover . " You 've got a point , kid , " she said , and gestured to the stacked cushions that served as chairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too , Medium . I 'll make coffee . " " Thank you , " Alkres said . He settled himself cautiously on the largest of the piles , and after a moment , I seated myself beside him . Guil vanished into the kitchen , letting its curtain-door fall shut behind her . Alkres looked far older than his years , harsh shadows beneath his eyes and hollowing his cheeks . I held out my arm , and Alkres burrowed against me , soundlessly crying . Moraghan turned her back on us , deliberately blind . I wrapped my arms around the boy , wishing there were something I could do or say to comfort him . " I 'm sorry , " I whispered , rocking him as if he were a much younger child . " I 'm so sorry . " We stayed like that for a minute , maybe longer , and then Alkres pushed me away and sat up , scrubbing at his face . " I 'm all right , " he said , almost angrily . Moraghan said , without turning , " Did I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the Trade Board ? He said there was n't a damn thing he could do . I bet he 's sorry now . " She turned then , not waiting for my answer , and looked at Alkres . " Stephan used to be in my squadron  --  I used to be with the Peacekeepers . When I was your age , I was piloting a drome fighter . Four years later , I was commanding the whole squadron . Do n't worry , you can handle it . " Before Alkres could decide how to answer that , Guil said , " Leith . " There was a note in the para ' an 's voice that made us all turn to her , and Leith said , " Trouble ? " " Maybe . I was listening to the newscast , in there . The Brandr are looking  --  actively looking  --  for you two now . " Guil set the coffee service on the low table , and gave a lopsided grin . " The stadtholder 's threatening to file a complaint with the Ship 's Council @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Brandr may do to retaliate . " " " How can the Brandr do anything in Destiny ? " Alkres said . " It 's our city . " " Reidun Brandr says , " Guil began , her voice rich with irony , " thatp181with your Tower destroyed , there 's no real government here and they have to step in to keep the peace . " " Who 's Reidun Brandr ? " Leith asked . Guil shrugged . Alkres frowned . " He 's their Demi-heir , I think . " " Oh . " Leith twisted her gloved wrist in her encircling fingers . " I think , Trey , we 'd better find you another bolt hole , just in case . " I leaned forward and poured myself a cup of coffee that I did n't want . I sipped the scalding liquid , trying to think . I did n't really know anyone else in Destiny , at least no one that I felt sure I could trust . Emerant Ansson , the Family 's local medium , was a possibility  --  but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know where they stood . Most of the Destiny people were Ingvarrs , like the stadtholder . The only mainline Halex I knew was Rehur , and he was a ghost . Did that matter ? I wondered suddenly . I took another swallow of coffee , feeling the caffeine take hold . Rehur might be dead , under the code , but I was a medium . As long as I was present , Alkres was acting within the code  --  and if the situation were bad enough to drive us into the Necropolis , it would be bad enough for us to risk bending the code a little . There were other advantages to contacting Rehur , I realized : who better than an actor , with all his contacts in the Necropolis , to spread the news that Alkres was alive and well , and claimed his birthright ? It would n't matter that he was a ghost  --  there were para ' anin enough to hear his message and pass it along to the living . " You 're right , " I said aloud . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the khy sonon-na ? " " How could I forget him ? " Leith grinned , then sobered quickly . " He was the twin to your Demi-heir , was n't he ? " " Rehur ? " Alkres looked up quickly . I nodded . " I think  --  I know he 'll shelter us , if we have to take refuge in the Necropolis . " I paused , wondering if I should explain the other things I had in mind , then decided not to do it just yet . Alkres had enough to worry about ; let him get as much rest as he could now , before I gave him something new to trouble him . " Alkres , you stay with Leith and Guil . They 'll look after you while I make the arrange-ments . " Alkres looked as if he 'd protest , but then he nodded . Guil said , " You 're going into the Necroplis now ? " " That 's right , " I said , and after a second , she nodded.  | " " They 're looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like an offworlder . You 're right . " Leith said , " If anything goes wrong , we 'll make for the ship . There 're ways to get into the port . " " All right , " I said , and hauled myself to my feet . The coffee had helped drive away some of the weariness , but not all . Gull said something in a low voice and vanished into one of the inner rooms . A moment later she was back , an opened bottle in her hand . " Stinnit , " she said , and held out a blue-banded capsule . " You 'll need it . " I took the pill gratefully , swallowing it dry . It was too soon for the chemicals to take effect , but I could already feel the psychological lift . " Thanks , " I said , and looked at Leith . " " We 'll be here or at the ship , " she said . Drawing my cloak around me , I let myself out into the sunlight . Despite the fact that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of people out on the streets , made restless by the raid and the continuing Brandr presence in the city . It was not hard to lose myself among the crowds , and I made my way to the Necropolis wall without attracting undue notice . At the green gates , I adjusted my badge so that it lay outside the hood of my cloak , and attached myself to a sober group of para ' anin . As I 'd hoped , the city policeman assumed I was with them , and waved us through together . There were no Brandr in sight , for which I was grateful . The Necropolis looked very different in daylight . The theaters , bars , and restaurants were all closed , their windows shuttered over . The streets were quiet , and I felt as though a hundred pairs of eyes were watching me from the buildings ' upper floors . It took me longer than I 'd expected to find Rehur 's building , but when I finally got there , the main door swung open to my touch . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be locked , and I would have to identify myself for all to hear over the building 's guard system . I climbed the stairs two at a time , hoping I would n't meet anyone , until at last I stood outside Rehur 's door . There was a piece of yellow paper stuck to the panel just above the latchplate . It took me a minute to decipher his scrawl , but at last I figured it out : " Belit  --  Late rehearsal tonight , the Matador , nineteen hours/whenever . See you there . " It was signed with his initial . I stood for a moment , staring at the card . There was no tellingp183when the rehearsal would end , so there was no point in my waiting for him here . If nothing else , I would be extremely conspicuous , sittingoutside his door until he got home . On the other hand , I did n't want to return to Gull 's flat without having seen Rehur . . . . I frowned at the card again , and came to my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had seen The Man Who Killed in His Sleep there , the last time I came to Destiny  --  and I doubted small theater companies had changed too much since my own days as an actor . The stinnit was taking hold now . I felt sure I could talk my way into the theater , and wait for Rehur there . The Matador lay on the far side of Broad Street . I retraced my steps to the main tram line , and followed its tracks up Broad Street toward the northern greengate . The buildings here were shuttered , too , shorn of banners and lights . Though I knew people had to be working inside , getting ready for the coming Dark , I felt as though I were walking through an abandoned city . I was glad to make the turn into the Matador 's alley . The front of the house was shuttered and dark , of course , but I found the stage door easily enough , and pulled the door chain . After a moment , the door opened a crack , and a woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Witchwood rehearsing here ? " The woman frowned , and I hurriedon without giving her a chance to answer . " Rehur left me a note . He said he 'd be late , and that I should meet him here . " The woman 's face cleared . " Yeah , they 're here . They 'll be a while yet  --  they 're taping  --  but if you 'd like , you can come in and watch . " I had hoped she would say that . " That 'd be great , thank you . " She pushed the door open further , and I stepped inside . The Matador'sbackstage area smelled like every other holotheater I 'd ever been in , a faintly dusty smell offset by the burned smell of the puppet consoles . I smiled , savoring it in spite of everything . " This way  --  I did n't get your name ? " " Trey Maturin . " The woman nodded . " Have you been to a taping before ? " " Yes , quite a few , " I answered , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rules , " the woman said , satisfied , and pushed through a heavy curtain . We were in the backstage proper now , and I was careful to stay close behind her . We passed the musicians ' stand , and the doorkeeper paused to speak to the red-haired woman at the keyboard . It was the woman , Belit , whom I 'd met the night of the khyp184sono . I smiled at her automatically , and she gave me a puzzled look , not quite remembering . " How 's it going ? " the doorkeeper said , quietly , and Belit transferredher attention to the other woman . " Okay . I 'd say they 've got another hour , at least . What 's up ? " " A friend of Rehur 's is here to see him , " the doorkeeper answered . Belit 's eyes widened in recognition , and she raised a hand in greeting . " He 's on right now , " she said , " but I 'll pass the word when he 's through . " " Thanks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to follow . We skirted the elaborate lighting console , the doorkeeper murmuring a greeting to the young man monitoring its dials , and pushed through another heavy curtain . It gave onto the stage itself , at extreme stage right , and I caught a quick glimpse of the group onstage before the doorkeeper led me down the short flight of steps to the seats . She pointed to a seat toward the middle of the third row , and I sat quickly . Onstage , the blond puppetmaster  --  Nariko-Ash  --  turned towardour movement , frowning , but the doorkeeper gave some sort of hand signal . The puppetmaster nodded , and turned back to her work . The doorkeeper slipped away again . The puppetmasters had set up a portable tape rig to stage left  --  a small light platform surrounded by a fragile-looking scaffold studded with cameras and secondary lights . More lights and cameras were suspended from the canopy . Rehur stood in the center of the column of light , hands on his hips in a familiar , challenging pose . The darkhairedpuppetmaster , Rowan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body . She shook her head , and looked at Ash . The blond puppetmaster put a hand to her forehead . " Rehur , " she said . " You are playing a demon , the incarnation of evil . Stop looking for sympathy . " Rehur threw up his hands , and I saw that he was wearing threeinchclaws on his fingertips . " All right , fine , " he said . I could tell it had been a long rehearsal . " Thank you , " Ash said . Rowan said , as though there had been no disagreement , " Tenth kata , please , Rehur . " Rehur stood still for an instant longer , then shook himself , and moved fluidly into the proper stance , torso half turned away from Rowan , his left hand extended palm up , fingers bent to display thep185glittering claws . His right elbow was tucked close to the body , hand out , palm down , fingers spread . In the same moment , his face assumed a sullen arrogance that contrasted nicely with his delicate features . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ please . " Rowan pointed her remote-control wand at the base of the platform and pressed a button . Thin lines of ruby light lanced from the cameras , snaring Rehur in their web . He was wearing the usual taping clothes  --  a skintight , hooded pullover sewn with reflective points at each joint , and a pair of dun-colored trousers . Each beam centered on a reflector , confirming camera position and outlining Rehur 's upper body in little explosions of light . Rowan nodded . " All set . " " Go , " Ash answered . The other puppetmaster touched a second button on the remote , and the red beams disappeared . In the same instant , the lights intensified , and I winced , remembering the heat and the blinding glare . I had always hated puppet work . " Rolling , " Rowan said , still calmly . " Begin  --  now . " Rehur 's left arm curled in toward his body , a slow , inhuman movement . When the claws almost touched his shoulder , he flung both1 arms wide , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knee , arms wrapping protectively about himself . There was nothing sympathetic , or even human , in the gesture . Rowan said , " And cut . " She looked at Ash . " That 's more like it , " the blond woman said . " How 's the film ? " Rowan crossed to the platform , bent to examine the readouts along its base . Rehur , standing now , watched curiously . " All right , " Rowan said at last . " It 's a workable tape . " " Good , " Ash said briskly . " Rehur , we 're done , thank you . Ivena ? " One of the women sitting in the clump of actors at stage right looked up alertly , and began stripping off her outer clothing . Rehur jumped down from the taping platform , pushing back the hood of his shirt . " We 'll get your tape replaced , " Ash continued , " and then we 'll have a quick run-through with the uncut puppets . Then we can all go home . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I could n't help grinning . I remembered nights like this only too well . At Ash 's nod ,  |p186Ivena  stepped briskly onto the platform , and held up her arms while Rowan adjusted the cameras . The actor was wearing the marked tights as well , indicating that Rowan was making a full-body puppet . I wondered just what would be added to Rehur 's half-puppet to make the demon . Ivena 's taping went relatively quickly , needing only five takes to get what Ash wanted . Her movements were less dramatic than Rehur 's , and I assumed that the puppetmasters would be doing a lot with that particular image . When they had finished , Rowan bent to pull the heavy tape cartridge from the base of the platform . Ash clapped her hands sharply . " All right , we 've got the puppets . Now , let 's run through the secondscene  --  just once , to get the feel of the new tapes  --  and then we can all go home . " The actors who had been waiting stage right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ places , talking among themselves . Rowan fitted the two cartridges  --  Rehur 's and Ivena 's tapes  --  into the master control console , and began fiddling with the dials . As the actors settled into their positions , I finally recognized the play : The Possession , probably the oldest warhorse in the Oresteian canon . It was no wonder Rehur had looked unhappy . The Possession 's lead-villain is the demon , traditionally a puppet ; from the look of things , Rehur 's only live role was doubling as a minor courtier . " Places , please . " Ash positioned herself behind the console , hands moving surely across her controls . Rowan , at her right , barely looked up from her keyboard . Ash pushed a button , and lights sparked momentarilyon Rehur 's chest and Ivena 's left shoulder . The puppetmasterfrowned . " Mark , Ivena . " The actor shifted , and Ash said , " All right . Let 's go , the soul-stealing . Take it from your line , Per  --  ' the forces of darkness surround us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his cue , and the scene began to move . Even I had seen this short play too many times , but it never seemed to lose its appeal to the Oresteians . Maybe it was becausethe plot was so uncomplicated in its march of crime , supernaturalretribution , and cleansing : a young and foolish prince calls up a demon to rid herself of a rival , only to have the demon demand her own soul as its reward . After much repining , the prince accepts her death , because only through that sacrifice can the demon be de/stroyed . This was the climax of the play , when the demon appears in its most horrific aspect , and draws the prince 's soul out of her body , only to be struck down by the prince 's chosen heir . At the proper moment , the puppets appeared , the puppeteers matching the figures ' movements to the actors ' gestures . The demon beckoned and called , its taped voice a distorted version of Rehur 's ; the soul-puppet was drawn struggling from Ivena 's body , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  the hero , Ysaje  --  mimed shooting the silver arrow , and the demon writhed and fell . Falling , it was consumed in flames , to spectacular effect . It was a rather neat performance , wasted on a truly inferior play . " Not bad , " Ash said . " Not bad at all . " She looked down at her board , and flipped another switch . " Hold your places just for a minute . I want to make a quick run with the full demon . No , Rowan , do n't bother with the soul , I just want to put the pieces together . " Someone onstage groaned , but the actors did as they were told . Ash touched controls , bringing the demon out from around Rehur 's body . This time , the human torso was attached to a pair of scaled and talonedlegs , creating an image out of a conservative religious 's nightmare . Ash brought the composite image across the stage at half speed , concentrating on keeping the two halves together , and finally cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " That 's all , thank you for your patience . See you tomorrow evening for the final . " The group on stage broke apart instantly , voices rising in conversation . Rehur came toward the edge of the stage , puffing off the tight taping shirt . " Trey ? " I came forward to meet him , seeing again the tattooed snake that coiled around his left bicep . In the harsh light from the stage , I could see what it attempted to hide . Beneath the dyes , his skin was pocked and scarred from yearly vaccinations : actors on Orestes count as prostitutes , and with some reason . Someone called his name , and he turned just long enough to catch the thrown tunic before turning back to me . " What 's happened ? " His voice was low , controlled , but I could hear the fear below the polished surface . " You 've heard that the Tower 's taken , burned ? " I said . There was no time to be gentle , but still , I felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his tunic into a wadded ball . " It 's bad news , " I said . " I 'm sorry , but there are n't many survivors . Herself sent out the children who were at the Tower , and they 're with the Ansson Holder now , but I 'm afraid . . . . " I faltered , seeing the color drain from his face and the rising pain in his huge eyes , and had to force myself to go on . " Those are all the survivors we know about . " Rehur 's eyes flickered shut , but he forced them open again . " Rohin ? " " He got us out , " I said , wondering if the knowledge that his twin had died by the code would be any comfort at all . " He got us to the escape tunnel , and then went back . I 'm afraid he 's dead  --  true-dead . " Rehur managed an oddly bitter smile . " That 's Rohin , " he said , and shook himself . " Who 's the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your help , " I said . " Alkres . " Rehur frowned . " He 's only fifteen . " " And the Patriarch , " I said . " Rehur , I need your help . " " But I 'm dead , " Rehur protested , automatically and without bitterness . Around us , the stage lights winked out , the noises of rehearsal fading , and he shook himself again . " We ca n't talk here , " he said , pulling his tunic over bare skin . " Will you come back to my place ? " " Of course . " We crossed Broad Street in silence . Overhead , the sky was darkeningtoward Sunset , Agamemnon 's half-disk brighter against the deepeningblue . Objects cast a double shadow , shifting toward twilight . The main door of Rehur 's building was still unlocked . The actor made a face as he pushed it open , muttering something about inviting trouble . I followed him up the stairs and into the flat.  |p189After  Maturin had left , Rehur curled himself into the corner of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was burned  --  Rohin was dead  --  but the Family had survived , sort of , and he was still bound to do whatever he could to help . Especially for Alkres . .. He remembered the ult'eir as a solemn boy of nine , not shy , but very conscious of the ten years between them . That was the last time he had spoken to Alkres ; a year later he had been declared dead , and was happily established in the Necropolis . He caught up his pillow and laid it across his drawn-up knees , resting his face against the cool fabric . Maturin had asked for two things , a place to hide if they were driven out of their present hiding place , and for Rehur to help spread the word among the Halex of Destiny that Alkres lived . The actor sighed , rubbing his cheek against the pillow . The second was easy enough . Lulan , owner-manager of the May-apple , was a para ' an of Halex in Halex , and prided herself on her connections with  --  and her years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Every Halex in the capital passed through at least the gaming rooms on the May-apple 's lower levels , if not the rooms on the upper floors . If he passed the news to her , it would be all over Destiny within a calendar-day . She might also be the answer to Maturin 's first request , Rehur thought suddenly . After all , he himself was known to be twin brotherp190of the Halex Demi-heir  --  he had never made any secret of it  --  so his flat would hardly be a safe refuge . But the May-apple . . . . He sat up straight , trying to find holes in the idea . Lulan catered to ghosts and para anin as well as to the living , was used to handling a mixed crowd , so there would be little risk of Alkres 's breaking the code . And besides , Rehur thought , he 'd have a medium with him to protect him . Yes , if Maturin and the rest were driven out of their present hiding place , the May-apple would be the perfect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the stove-bed , and reached for the chronograph he had discarded on the single table . It was well after clock-midnight , the hour of Sunset and the official opening of the Dark ; he put the chronograph aside , sighing . There was no point in visiting the May-apple now , he thought . Lulan would be entirely too busy with her first rush of clients to see him ; better to wait until clock-morning , when the rush had slacked off a bit , and she could spare him time to listen . He shivered suddenly , and reached back into the bed to adjust its heater . The worn mechanism sighed and crackled , but a moment later he felt a new surge of warmth against his back . He knew there was nothing to do but wait , that there was nothing he could do until clock-morning . Still , he found it very hard to undress and climb into the welcoming warmth of the bed . He pulled the thermal curtains closed across the bed 's open side and drew the blankets close around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Maturin 's news on top of that , had drained him more than he had realized . He fell into an exhausted sleep almost at once . When he finally woke , the chronograph read seven minutes after noon of the twentieth day of the tenth standard month . Rehur swore at the glowing display , then fumbled for the room controls until he found the right switch and flooded the windowless room with hard , untinted light . He had never intended to sleep so late , had hardly thought he could sleep at all . . . . He shook himself angrily , and touched another button on the room 's control plaque , switching on Destiny 's primary newscast as he went into the flat 's tiny bathroom . By the time he 'd finished , it was clear that the newscast was n't saying anything useful , and he switched it off , scowling . He pulled clothes from the boxes stacked along the wall , one corner of his mind mechanically matching colors , and pulled on trousers , shirt , and knittedtunic , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it was clear that Brandr were still in Destiny , and while they had so far stayed out of the Necropolis , there was no guarantee they 'd continue to do so . And my face , Rehur thought , with a wry smile , is Halex enough to betray me , even if no one has bothered to point out my background . Someone will , too ; it 's been common gossip in the Necropolis for years . The idea of a disguise seemed almost too melodramaticto be taken seriously , too much like one of the popular holoplays , and his smile widened into a grin . Then he sobered . Melodramaticor not , some sort of disguise would keep the Brandr from realizing just what he was , and if he were to help Maturin , he would have to avoid that at all costs . Still , he felt distinctly foolish as he went back into his bathroom , to return a moment later with his batteredmakeup box . He set the box on the table and opened it , drawing out the heavy mirror @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his only chair out of its place by the door and pulled it up to the table . He seated himself in front of the mirror and stared at his reflection , turning his head from side to side to study the familiar planes and angles . Then his decisions made , he reached into the box . Like most actors , he wore little makeup offstage ; it felt strange to wear it now . He smoothed on a creamy base , deliberately obscuring the sharp lines of cheek and jaw , then added false shadows and a touch of color , subtly rounding his long face . He paused , shifting again to study the effect , and decided that any more would be too much . Then , frowning slightly , he began to reshape his eyes . They were his most conspicuous feature , as he knew well , and the most memorable . Carefully , he rubbed a lighter base across the lids , coveringthe natural shadows , then fumbled among the lining pencils until he found the lightest shade of brown . With it , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and smudged it almost to invisibility . When he looked again into the mirror , his eyes seemed noticeably smaller . A darker lip color drew attention away from the eyes . At last , he leaned back from the mirror to study his handiwork . Slowly , he began to laugh . Without consciously meaning to , he 'd copied most of the makeup for Niklas Castel , the troublemaking pilot who was the pivotal character in The Wreck of Tenshi Nen . Niklas had been his first good role with Witchwood ; he hoped it was a good omen . He sobered quickly , studying his reflection for a final time , and quickly added the ghostmark in the center of his forehead . Thatp192would protect him from unwanted advances . The fading light of Sunsetwould soften the theatrical lines ; it would still be obvious that he was wearing makeup , but that was nothing out of the ordinary in the Necropolis . More important , he was no longer recognizable as a Halex  --  at least not at first sight . He stood , stretching , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ones on the bottom row until he found what he was looking for . He spread the dark crimson fabric thoughtfully across his hands , checking for muncher holes , then wound it around his head and shoulders , creating a sort of hooded cape . Throws like that had been very popular two years before , until the Streetwalkers ' Tong had made them the badge of their profession . Rehur had not worn this one in some time , but had n't been able to bring himself to discard the rich fabric . Now , looking out from its concealing folds , he was very glad he 'd kept it . He found the gloves he 'd bought to match it , and straightened , looking at his image in the long mirror that hung beside the door . A stranger , one of the hundreds of prostitutes that worked the Necropolis , stared back at him . Rehur nodded , already creating the character to match his new shape , and pushed open the door of the flat . No one was moving in the hall . Rehur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explain himself , and reached the street without meeting anyone . The May-apple lay on the eastern edge of the Necropolis , not far from one of the smaller green gates . It was a long walk , and the Broad Street trams , running along the Necropolis 's north-south axis , would n't shorten it . The actor sighed , still angry with himself for oversleeping , and set off for the Nezumi Square . The streets were unusually empty for the Necropolis after Sunset . Rehur frowned , and quickened his steps a little . Broad Street was a little busier , knots of people moving along its bright length , but here and there there were gaps in the line of lights , where a building was still shuttered . That was unheard of  --  the Necropolis 's businesses had to open every hour of every Dark , to make up for the business lost during the long Day  --  and Rehur found himself looking back , half expecting to see the owners appear to remove the shutters and switch on the working lights . A tram stopped outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Broad Street bars , but only a few people got off . Rehur shook his head , and looked away , glancing toward the southern end of the street . There were even fewer people moving there , but nearly all the buildings were lit . As he watched , a groupp193emerged from one of the unlit buildings , first four people together , and then two more who lagged behind . The four watched from the center of the street while the two lowered the shutters , making no move to help . Only when the building 's lights came on did they turn away . They were wearing lumpy battledress , Rehur realized belatedly : Brandr troops , making sure life went on as usual . He shivered , and hurried on across the street . At the head of the side street , he could n't stop himself from looking back . The four were watching him , but they were too far away , in the dim light , for him to see their expressions . He turned his head away , the movement excruciatingly casual , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Brandr were nowhere to be seen . He took the long way to the May-apple anyway , doubling back through the Fountain Square . The water was beginning to freeze around the edges of the basin , reflecting the flaming Sunset sky . He paused , pretending to stare at the famous sight , and knew miserably that he was overacting . No one was following him . It was only two more blocks to the May-apple , down a quiet , welllitside street . A tall woman , masked and wrapped in a slit-backed coat , was leaving the building as Rehur approached . He looked away politely as she passed , and turned into the alley that led to the ghostentranceon the building 's side . The door opened instantly to his signal , and an adolescent looked out at him . She could n't have been older than seventeen , and Rehur 's eyes went immediately to her collar . She wore a medium 's badge , and he sighed , relieved . " Can I help you ? " the girl asked . Her voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wariness beneath the refinement . " I 'd like to see Lulan , " Rehur answered . The girl licked her lips uneasily , and did not answer . It was no wonder the girl was nervous , Rehur thought , with everything that 's happened , but I do n't understand why she 's on duty at all . Shoba , May-apple 's regular medium , occasionally let his daughter take over when business was light , but this hardly seemed the time . " She 's engaged , " the girl said at last , drawing out the words . " Ca n't it wait ? " Rehur shook his head , beginning to be infected by the girl 's nervousness . " I 'm afraid not . " The girl did n't move from where she stood , blocking the door . " Who 's calling , then ? "  |p194The  actor hesitated , wondering if he should lie . But Lulan would n't recognize a false name , and his own name would at least get him a hearing . " Tell her Rehur . I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repeated , and stepped back into the entranceway , pulling the heavy door with her . Rehur followed her into an empty waiting room , and stopped at her gesture . " If you 'll wait here , " she said , as though repeating a lesson , " I 'll tell the conciliatrix you 're here . " Rehur murmured agreement , and seated himself on one of the cushioned benches . The girl slipped away , closing the painted door tightly behind her . Rehur leaned back against the silk-covered wall , resigning himself to a long wait . Very faintly , he could hear the murmur of conversation in the gaming rooms , and the clatter and ping of the various machines . The May-apple seemed to be doing a normal business , despite everything . The actor sighed , wishing there were a chronograph in the otherwise opulently furnished room . He was due back at the Matador by the eighteenth hour for the final rehearsal  --  not that it mattered all that much , he thought bitterly . Rowan and Ash had already made the puppet that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stage to fill up the court scene . The painted door opened then , cutting off his train of thought . A rather harassed-looking man beckoned from the doorway . So Shoba 's finally condescended to show himself , Rehur thought , but stood obediently . " Lulan 'll see you now , " the medium said , with a faint , unhappy frown . " She asked me to apologize for keeping you waiting , but she had unexpected visitors . " " I 'm grateful she can see me at all , " Rehur said . He followed the medium up the narrow ghost-stairs , his feet sinking soundlessly in the black carpet . He could hear voices , growing louder as they neared the top , but he could n't quite make out the words . Then they had reached the landing , and Shoba gestured politely for the ghost to precede him into the little antechamber . The door into Lulan 's office was halfway open , and Rehur could see , beyond Lulan 's expensively robed shoulders , the dull grey of Brandr battledress . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on into the dimly lit antechamber , trying to move with unforced ease . He seated himself on a tambour just out of the Brandr officer 's line of sight , hoping the man had not noticed the sudden hesitation . Behindp195him , Shoba whispered a curse and moved to close the door . Lulan 's shoulders twitched , but she kept talking smoothly. "  --  always cooperate with the civil authority , but frankly , sor , this is a Tong house . I 'm only the conciliatrix  --  " " I understand , " the officer interrupted . He stepped forward , reachingpast the conciliatrix to catch the closing door . " And I am sorry to have interfered with your work . " He was standing full in the doorwaynow , staring frankly at the hooded actor . Rehur hesitated , then , trusting to his makeup and the poor lighting , lifted nerveless hands to his hood , pushing it back to expose the ghostmark on his forehead . The officer lifted an eyebrow , and Rehur made himself meet that inquiring gaze with wide-eyed innocence . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 's looking for . For the ghost-wing . " " I see . " The officer 's tone gave nothing away . He turned back to Lulan , still punctiliously polite . " Again , I 'm sorry to have troubled you during working hours . I hope you 'll think about what I said . " " Of course , " Lulan answered . She walked with him to the office 's other door , smiling graciously . " This is a Tong house , which means voting , but I do have some influence . I 'll do what I can . " " You 're most kind , " the officer said , and bowed himself out . Lulan closed the door behind him , and then , with a decisive gesture , pressed the lockplate . Shoba said quickly , " Ama , I 'm sorry . I thought I 'd closed that door . " Lulan glared at him . " You 're a fool , Shoba , and you always have been . Get out , we 'll talk about this later . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a deep breath , visibly calming herself . Rehur said , " I hope I have n't gotten you into trouble , Lulan . " The conciliatrix shook her head , still frowning , but beckoned the actor into the room . She waved vaguely at the chairs and tambours scattered around the opulent office , and seated herself behind her executive 's desk . Rehur pulled one of the leather-covered chairs a little closer to the desk , but waited until Lulan had finished punching security codes into the desk 's built-in systems . " Now we can talk , " she said , finally . " What brings you here , Rehur ? " " What did they want ? " the actor asked , in the same moment.  | " What do you think ? " the conciliatrix said , and snorted . " They know the Family comes here ; they want me to be sure there 's no trouble . I repeat , what can I do for you , Rehur ? " The actor took a deep breath , and launched into an explanation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the idiom of the holoplays , and when Lulan responded in kind , he borrowed more freely , building on the old themes of kinship and duty . When he had finished , the conciliatrix leaned back in her chair , her broad face set into stern , severe lines . " So , " she said , after a long moment , " we still have a genarch . " There was a deep satisfaction in her voice . She shook herself , and went on , almost briskly , " Of course I 'll do what the medium asks  --  God send this Maturin 's more use than Shoba is . If they need shelter , they can come here . I 've rooms for them , nobody would suspect it . The Patriarch can depend on me . I 'll see that the Family knows he 's claimed his place , too  --  I 'll make sure of it . " Her spate of talk dried as quickly as it had appeared . After a moment , when it seemed the conciliatrix had nothing more to say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Lulan did n't seem to hear . " Fifteen years old , " she said quietly , almost to herself . " And our Patriarch . " She looked directly at the actor , shaking her head . " What 's the world coming to , Rehur , that all he 's got to help him are a ghost and a para'an ? " " And Maturin , " Rehur protested . " A medium and a spacer , two off-worlders and a para ' an not even of our kin . " Lulan gave a twisted smile . " And us . What is the world coming to ? " Rehur made his way back to his flat in an unaccountable state of depression , despite Lulan 's agreeing to help Alkres . The Sunset light was fading from the sky , and lay in a smoldering band along the eastern horizon ; overhead , Agamemnon swelled toward full . The twilightmade everything ghostly and indistinct , draining even the lighted signs of some of their vitality . The streets were even emptier than they had been , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A know of people had gathered on the building 's stoop , gesturing with actors ' freedom as they talked . Rehur checked , then recognized them as various of his neighbors , and made himself approach . Noddinga greeting , he started up the stairs past them , but Witchwood 's red-haired musician called after him.  | " Have you heard the news , Rehur ? " The actor paused reluctantly , but turned back so as not to arouse suspicion . " I 've heard , " he said , and his voice cracked on the words . " Rohin 's true-dead . " It was the first time he 'd said those words , and a wave of grief washed over him . Saying it aloud , he believed it , completelyand fully , and the loss was even more painful than he 'd feared . " I am sorry , " Belit said , and the others  --  all from Witchwood , except for Ume-Kai  --  murmured their condolences as well . The worn formulae steadied Rehur , and he managed a wry smile . " It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theaters are closed . " That was Solvar , who generally played second villain . The touch of malice in his voice cleared Rehur 's thoughts completely . " Closed ? What do you mean ? " " Exactly that , " Solvar said , easily riding over the others ' confused answers . He had been a Berngard , of the Axtell Kinship , and had no particular stake in Main Continent quarrels . " The Destiny council has decided to close everything  --  theaters , cabarets , bars and all  --  for at least three calendar-days . " " As a token of mourning , " the third-lead Disa interjected . Belit snorted . " More like trying to figure out what to do . The whole council'sIngvarrs , Halex Kindred . " Solvar smiled . " Mourning , nothing . They closed because the Brandr captain told them to . " Ume-Kai turned a doll 's face toward the smaller man . He was in deshabille -- woman 's face and man 's clothes : word of the closings had caught him dressing for the promenade . " Where did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gilder , then , and she heard it from Halsom Ingvarr in the gatekeepers ' office , " Solvar retorted . Ume-Kai made a face , silenced , and there were thoughtful nods all around the circle . That channel , from civil servant to his para ' an cousin who ran the Old Garret Theater , was usually reliable . Belit said , " Whatever the reason , it means we lose our contract . " She glanced up at Rehur , standing on the step above her , and gave an apologetic shrug . " I know that 's nothing to your loss , Rehur , but who needs more trouble on top of it ? I already spoke to Rowan , though . The Matador 's cancelled the contract , so there 's no pay for any of us. "  | " And no rehearsal , of course , " Disa said , with a self-mocking grin . The Witchwood Company had always lived hand to mouth . Rehur shrugged . " We 'll manage . But thanks , Belit . " " Rehur . " Ume-Kai laid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes registering and assessing the other 's unusual makeup . " I do n't know if it 's true , but I heard  --  " He hesitated briefly , to calculated effect , and Rehur saw the quick , malicious glance toward Solvar . " I heard , " Ume-Kai continued , " that the Brandr have n't accounted for all your Kindred , not everybody that should have been at the Tower . Perhaps . . . " He let his voice trail off , and Solvar made a disbelieving noise . Rehur stood for a second , caught between laughter and tears . This was almost certainly Lulan 's work , spreading the rumor as she 'd promised  --  the conciliatrix never wasted time  --  but even so . . . . He shook the thought away . Rohin was dead , he had Maturin 's word on it , but the minne 's suggestion had been  --  mostly  --  well meant . " " Thanks , Ume , " he said , and to his horror his voice broke on a sob . He turned away , blinded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ building . Inside his own flat , he slammed the door behind him , then stood for a long moment before switching on the lights , fighting for control . Rohin is dead , he told himself almost angrily , but Alkres is alive , and needs you . And the Brandr know he 's alive  --  why else would they have been at the May-apple ?  --  and that will eventually mean a search . Emotions at bay again , Rehur turned on the lights , and then the heating coil at the foot of the stove-bed . He went into the bathroomand washed away the heavy makeup , then unwound the crimsonthrow and put it carefully away . He settled himself against the stove-bed 's pillows , feet stretched toward the slowly warming coil , and tried to think clearly . He had to get in touch with Maturin , tell the medium that Lulan was willing to help , and that the Brandr were patrolling the Necropolis  --  but the comnet was too easily monitored , and the Brandr were bound to be watching all traffic in and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his knees , wishing , not for the first time , that he were as clever at intrigue as the lead-villains he played . In another hour or three , the last of the Sunset sky would have faded  --  but without the crowds moving in and out of the green gates to mask him , would he dare try to reach the flat where Maturin wasp199hiding ? There was too much chance he 'd be spotted , even with the makeup ; he was n't even sure if the Brandr at the May-apple had been taken in by it . There were people he would trust with the message , but he had no way of proving to Maturin that they were to be trusted . By the same token , the comnet was quick , but it was easily monitored and traced , and the Brandr would have to be stupid not to have put a watch on it . No , he thought , he would have to risk carryingthe message himself . But not just yet . He sighed , and edged closer to the glowing coil , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ para ' an , the tug pilot  --  Guil ex-Tam'ne , her name was  --  did n't seem to be a fool ; he would have to trust her to stay put until the Dark deepened and he could slip out of the Necropolis in safety . A knock at the door interrupted his bleak thoughts . Lifting his head , he called , " Who 's there ? " " Belit . " The musician 's voice was hesitant . " I brought some tea ? " Rehur rose quickly to unlock the door . " Come in , and welcome . " The redhead 's smile was almost apologetic as she stepped into the flat . " If you 'd rather not have company , say . I wo n't be hurt . " She lifted the insulated pot , and the box of sandwiches she held in her other hand . " But I thought , you would n't want to cook , and you ought to eat . . . " Belit , thank you , " Rehur said , with all the warmth he could muster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulled over another of the wheeled storage boxes and rummaged in the standing cabinet for a pair of mugs , then took the sandwiches and put two of them into the cooker to toast . " Please stay . I 'd rather be with someone . " " Of course , " Belit said . She poured two mugs of tea while Rehur adjusted the cooker , and then the actor seated himself opposite her , resting both elbows on the scarred table top . They drank in silence , Belit 's quiet presence immensely comforting . " Thanks , Belit , " Rehur said again , after a while , and then , as the cooker chimed the end of its cycle , added , " No , I 'll get it . " He had just opened the cooker when there was another knock at the door . " Who 's there ? " " Solvar . " Rehur sighed , and Belit rolled her eyes , but there was nothing eithercould do without being unreasonably rude . And that , Rehur thought , making a face , could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lock and pulled back the door , saying , " What is it , Sol  --  " The words died on his lips as he saw who else stood there , almost hiding Solvar behind their bulk . Three big men , no , four , all in the grey Brandr battledress , flanked by a man who wore the black-hand badge of a medium . " Rehur , I 'm sorry , " Solvar began , and the tallest man , who carried an officer 's wand in his belt , said to the medium , " Shut him up . " The medium made a curt gesture , and Solvar slunk away . " You , woman , out , " the medium went on , jerking a thumb at Belit . " I 'm para'an of Fyfe in Fyfe , " Belit countered warily , rising to her feet . " " What 's your business with him ? " " No business of yours , Para ' , " one of the soldiers rumbled , and the officer said , " Get out . " Belit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on , Belit . " The musician did as she was told , but slowly , looking back as she went . Rehur folded his arms across his chest , trying to hide his fear . " What do you want ? " he asked again , looking at the medium . " These gentlemen want to know where your cousin is , " the mediumanswered , with a rote courtesy almost as terrifying as threats . " My cousins are dead , true-dead , " Rehur answered , with a touch of bitterness . " The ult'eir Alkres is alive , " the medium answered . " Where is he ? " " I do n't know , " Rehur began , and the officer cut in . " Tell him not to lie . " " You would be advised to tell the truth , " the medium said . " I 'm a dead man , " Rehur protested , with all the innocence he could muster . " How could the ult'eir come to me and live ? " " Tell him , " the officer said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he does n't stop wasting my time . " He held up his hand when the medium would have repeated his words . " Tell him I know he 's been in contact with the ult'eir , that he 's been trying to cause trouble with Lulan of the May-apple . Tell him , too , that I 'm not a patient man . " Rehur waited while all that was repeated to him , hugging himself in a vain attempt to stop the shaking . It 's no use , a voice was saying in his head , it 's no use , they spotted you , they know .... When the medium had finished , he took a deep breath , and shook his head . " I do n't know where he is , " he said again . " There must be some mistake . " Even to himself , the words sounded weak and unconvincing.  | " Persuade him , " the officer said , indifferently , and nodded at the biggest of the soldiers . The medium laid one hand on the badge at his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ritually conveyinghis own power to the other . Rehur took a step backward , knowingthere was nowhere to run , and the soldier moved with unexpectedspeed , catching the actor in a wrestler 's grip . Rehur gave a gasp of pain . The soldier calmly adjusted his hold , and doubled both the actor 's wrists almost to his shoulder blades , holding them there with one huge hand . He twisted the other hand in Rehur 's hair and drew his head sharply back , saying , " Answer the captain 's question . " " I do n't know , " Rehur wailed , and the soldier gave him a shake that threatened to snap his neck or pop his arms from their sockets . " Wait , " the captain said . " Medium , your sanction ? " The medium repeated the ritual gesture . When the transfer was complete , the captain stepped forward , pulling something from his pocket . He kept his hand closed around it until he stood within easy reach of Rehur , then brought his hand up in front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Do you see what this is ? " Rehur 's eyes were fixed on the ugly little box . The soldier hissed , " Answer the captain . " " Yes , " Rehur whispered obediently . The soldier shook him again , and the actor added , " It 's a laser knife . " In spite of his efforts , his voice trembled . The captain studied him dispassionately . " I understand you 're an actor , a puppet actor . Listen to me , then , if you want to go on working . I will ask you again where the ult'eir 's hidden , and for every lie I will mark you , face and body . " He tilted his head to one side . " They can do a lot with puppets , but I do n't think even the best operators can hide the marks this leaves . " Rehur could feel himself shaking in the soldier 's grip , and closed his eyes as the captain placed the head of the knife against his cheek . The focus bead was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at its lowest power it would leave scars that would never fade , that could never be hidden  --  he would never work again . . . . The captain 's voice seemed to come from a great distance . " Where is the ult'eir ? " Rehur choked , tried to pull his head away from the gentle touch of the knife , but the soldier held him motionless.  | " I will count to five , " the captain said , " and then I will push the button . One . " Rehur counted a dozen of his own quick heartbeats before the Brandr captain spoke again . " Two . " Rehur 's nerve broke . " Stop , " he cried , and caught his breath quickly , for fear the captain had n't heard . " Stop . I 'll take you there , you ca n't get in without me , but don ' t . " Miraculously , the knife lifted from his face . " You see ? " the captain said , to no one in particular , and pocketed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his grip , keeping one of Rehur 's arms doubled behind him , then shoved the actor ahead of him out of the flat . Rehur stumbled down the stairs , still breathing in painful sobs , almost too terrified to think . He could n't lead them to Alkres , to Maturin , he could n't  --  but if he did n't , the captain would make good his threat , and  --  He was suddenly aware that they were in the street outside the building . The soldier shook him . " Which way ? " That was the medium , resuming his proper function . Rehur stared at him , unable to make his frozen brain work , either to tell the truth or to invent a plausible lie . Behind him , remotely , he heard scraping , as someone opened a stairwell window to see the fun . " Which way ? " the medium asked again . In the same instant , somethinghissed sharply , and the Brandy captain pitched backward onto the metalled street . A crossbow bolt jutted under his ribs . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's arm , then lodged deep in the side of the soldier who held him . That man gave a choked cry and released his hold , sinking slowly to the ground . Rehur stared at him , unable for a moment to understand what was happening . " Rehur , run ! " That was Belit , leaning back from the window , , jerkingat the winch of her double-slide hunting bow . " Run , damn you ! " The other soldier had unslung his rifle , and fired by instinct at his attacker . Belit ducked back , but the bolt splattered against the windowframe . The second survivor , smarter than the first , turned his rifle toward Rehur . Belit cursed him , and fired . The bolt , half-cocked and badly aimed , barely grazed his shoulder , but it spoiled his aim , and his shot crackled into the road at Rehur 's feet . " Run ! " Belit shrieked again.  |p203The  last shot snapped Rehur out of his trance . He turned and fled down the long street , weaving to spoil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ windows and doors flew open , and the air filled with questions and curses . From a window below Belit 's came a wordless , ululating cry : Ume-Kai , waking the dead to this infringement of their privileges , rousing them to riot against the Brandr . Rehur put his head down , and ran.  |p207We  kept the newscasts on all the calendar-day , listening for any hint of trouble . To me , the droning voices of the announcers , with their monotonous appeals for calm and their continuous reports of quiet throughout the Halex Mandate , conveyed nothing of any use . Gull , with long experience of the Destiny newssystems , translated freely , but her interpretation was n't particularly encouraging . The Branch-lands offered no resistance to the continuing Brandr presence . After everything Herself had done to help them , I had expected better  --  but then , there was no genarch available to lead them , and the Holders refused to act . It was hard to do anything , yet , without leaders . Only in Destiny and a few of the Prosperities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it was serious , just shouting and rock-throwing , but nonetheless , I was somewhat encouraged by the reports . Gull shook her head . " They would n't report trouble if it was n't under control . " " Where the hell are they getting enough men to do all this ? " Leith muttered . Gull shrugged . " Every adult 's under arms-obligation , remember . And they 've got the Fyfe to help . " " And our Branch Holders are n't doing anything . " Alkres , who had spent most of the day sitting on Gull 's couch playing with an elec/tronic strat-game , looked up for the first time in hours . " Trey , do you think telling them I 'm alive will make them fight ? " " I hope so , " I said . I hoped , too , that Rehur would contact me soon , let me know if we had another refuge . It was looking as though it would be a while before we found a Holder we could trust  --  and I was not going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Holders committed themselves . A little after the fifteenth hour , the newscast reported that Yslin Rhawn had asked for an emergency meeting of the Ship 's Council . We all froze , even Alkres , and the strat-game fell silent at last . Cautiously , Guil reached to increase the volume . " If they broadcast the tape , " she whispered , " we 're in trouble . " For a moment , I did n't understand what she meant , but then the tape clicked on . Shorn of the measured rhetoric , Yslin Rhawn 's speech asked only for the Ship 's Council to consider the Brandr Patriarch'saccusations . He said nothing of their attack or the destruction of the Tower . Clearly , he was leaving his way clear to accept the Brandr offer of the genarchy , and I waited for the other Holders to register a protest . One by one , the answers trickled in : Fyfe and Axtell agreed at once to the meeting , neither genarch mentioning the attack ; the Ansson Holder also consented , stiffly , but without filing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present difficulties , " but agreed . Brandr sent a curt acknowledgement . That left only the Orillon , and given the communications lag , we could n't expect their answer for another half hour at the earliest . The newscast burbledon , talking about issues and precedents . With a violent movement , Guil cut the volume . " Excuse me . " Alkres stood , and very carefully placed the stratgameon the table . His face was set and white , lips pinched together to hold in tears . Without waiting for any answer , he disappeared into Gull 's spare bedroom . I started after him , not quite knowing what I 'd do , and Leith shook her head at me . " Let him be a little . " I hesitated , but as an adolescent , Leith had commanded other adolescents , and ought to know what she was doing . I sat down again , hoping she was right . The Orillon answer came promptly  --  the first good news we 'd had all day . The Orillon Patriarch agreed to the meeting , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Brandr for theirp209questionable behavior in pursuing their feud . It was the first sign of support from any quarter , and Leith sighed explosively . " Thank God there 's somebody honest in this system ! " Guil gave a curious shrug , and looked away . She was part of the Orillon Kinship , after all , and I wondered just what she meant by that gesture . Before I could ask , however , Leith pointed toward the spare bedroom . " You might want to tell him , now . " I nodded , a little reluctantly , but had to bow to her superior knowledge . I tapped on the doorframe , and opened the door a little way without waiting for an answer . Alkres was lying face down on the narrow pallet that served both as spare bed and as a couch . He did n't move until I said , " May I come in ? " He sat up then , drawing the back of one hand angrily across his face . " All right . " It was n't a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the room for storage and as a workroom , as well as a spare bedroom , and the shortest wall was filled with closed and open storage boxes . There were a couple of other boxes scattered across the floor , and a comfortable working chair stood in one corner beneath a powerful standing lamp . I seated myself on one of the boxes that had a padded top , and said , " We 've heard from the Orillon Patriarch . He 's said he 's going to protest to the Council . " " Wonderful , " Alkres said sarcastically . " Why are n't my people doingthat ? " I wished I knew the answer to that myself . " I do n't know . They 've been hard hit , remember  --  " " Not as hard hit as we have , " Alkres said . " Not in the same way , " I said , groping for the right words , " but pretty hard , all the same . They 've lost their leaders , either killed or driven underground like you , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for his own advantage . It 's no wonder they do n't know what to do . You ca n't blame them for being cautious . " " I can , " Alkres said fiercely . " And after all Herself did for them , too . They 're breaking the code , and I 'll get them for it . Especially Yslin Rhawn . " " Alkres , " I said , and put every gram of conviction I could muster into my voice . " You 're the Patriarch now , you ca n't afford that kind of talk . You have to lead them , not blame them  --  not now . "  | " You 're a mediator , you have to talk that way . " Alkres glared at me , unreconciled . " They 've broken the code , and they have to pay for it . " The code was never meant to deal with anything like this . There 's no precedent , is there , for a whole Branch being destroyed ? Especially not the mainline Family . " I took a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my mind since we left Federston . " I think this is going to have to be settled outside the code . " " The code 's the law ! " Alkres 's voice was outraged . " How can you settle anything without law ? " " " There 's law , " I said , slowly , " and there 's justice , and then there 're the human beings who have to manipulate those abstractions . Sometimesyou have to compromise  --  and improvise  --  to hold things together . And that 's what 's really important , holding things together . Yes , I 'm a mediator , yes it 's my job to say that , but I mean it . " Alkres stared at me , silenced but not convinced . After a moment , he said , " I want a cup of tea . " He was the genarch , I reminded myself  --  in fact , as well as name , head of a substantial local-planetary government . And I was his employee . I had done what I could , for now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ main room . Guil brewed tea for all of us , and brought out a tray of the salty snacks called sannin . I was n't precisely hungry , but I chewed on a few of the tough strips anyway , knowing I might need the calories . Leith paced back and forth , stopping periodically to listen to the newscast . Alkres played with his strat-game until I thought the beeps and clicks would drive me crazy . I stood it for as long as I could , but after two hours I was ready to smash the stupid thing . I was about to say so when Leith said , " " Listen ! " There was a note in her voice that stopped us all . She adjusted the volume , and the newscaster 's voice poured into the room . "  --  stadtholderhas agreed to the Demi-heir 's request that the Necropolis be closed until the present uncertainties are resolved . She has also agreed to consider the further requests for a clock-curfew , and that the Demi-heir 's men be allowed to supplement the regular police @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it was drowned by Guil 's feral yelp . " If that does n't get through to them , nothing will . "  |p211Leith  said " ' Supplement the regular police , ' huh ? Sounds to me like they 're gearing up for a search . " " To me , too , " I said , and wished we would hear from Rehur . " We 'd better be prepared to move fast . " " There 's always the port , " Leith said again . " You 'd be safe there . " " I 'm not running away , " Alkres said . " We do n't have to go anywhere , " Guil snapped . She looked at me . " The port complex will be safer than the city , though , if it comes to a search . They wo n't want to offend off-wonders . " " We 'll wait and see what happens , " I said firmly . " Keep the volume up , will you , Leith ? " Rehur arrived on the heels of the first newscasts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wall as Guil closed the door behind him , breathing heavily , his eyes as huge and mad as they had been when he played Belos . There was a bloody tear in the sleeve of his tunic . " I did what you asked , Trey , " he said , between gasps , " but it wo n't do any good . " " What do you mean ? " I said . " What 's happened ? " The ghost gave me a mirthless grin , but let Guil pull him toward a seat , wincing as she touched the injured arm . With an effort , Alkres remained in his seat , looking toward the comnet and the newscaster 's voice , but I could see his shoulders twitch every time his cousin spoke . " Off with it , " the para ' an said , and touched the collar of the actor 's tunic . Rehur complied , wincing , and I caught a glimpse of a nasty cut through the ripped and bloodied undershirt . Guil whistled softly to herself , and tore the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tattooed band . " Crossbow ? " Rehur nodded , and she vanished into the bathroom , to emerge a moment later with a battered aidkit . As she went to work on the cut , Rehur said , " When they closed the theaters  --  no , I 'd better start with Lulan . " He caught his breath as Guil applied a disinfectant wand to the cut , and went on slowly , " I went to Lulan of the May-apple , Trey , like I told you I would . She said she 'd help  --  I knew she would  --  but there were Brandr there when I got there , looking for him  --  " He jerked his head at Alkres , who was still struggling not to acknowledge the ghost 's presence . "  --  and I guess they recognized me , figured out what I was there for . They came to my flat .. .. " His voicep212slowed then , in a way that had nothing to do with the Para ' an 's deft touch with the aidkit . I said , " They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to it than that , I felt sure , but I would not press him . " Yeah . Belit , our synth-man , shot two of them  --  she keeps a hunting crossbow in her rooms  --  and I got away . They 're fighting all over the Necropolis now . " " Can they win ? " Leith said , quietly . Rehur shrugged . " I do n't know  --  I doubt it . " He looked at me . " Trey , they 'll use this as an excuse to crack down on the rest of the city , you know that . " " He 's right , " Guil said , adding a last piece of tape to the actor 's bandage . " We ca n't stay here . " " We go to the port , " Leith said . " " And we get off-world . " She met Alkres 's eyes steadily , ignoring his cry of outrage . " It 's your only chance , Patriarch . " " Go where , Leith ? " I asked , hoping she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a reckless , fighting grin . " Electra . Who else has made a protest ? The Orillon may not support you , but I bet they 'll give you sanctuary . " She had a point , though I distrusted the expression on her face . Then I shook myself . She was right  --  there were n't any other alternativesany more , and the sooner we left , the better . I opened my mouth to say as much , and felt the floor quiver underfoot . The whole buildingseemed to stagger forward , then sway back into place , upper floors following reluctantly behind the lower . " Hell 's teeth ! " Guil reached for the comnet controls , manipulating the service channels . " I forgot the damn Ivarning . " Enlightened and appalled , I reached for the almanac discarded among a stack of reading tapes . I flipped through the crudely printed pages until I found the day 's date , and fixed my eyes on the sketch , where the moons chased each other around a set of concentric rings . Sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the date was highlighted in red , with the words " tremors and volcanic activity likely " printed to one side . It happened every twenty-four calendar days , of course , and the Geo/Met office issued regular bulletins and warnings  --  but surely Destiny was n't a particularly active area ? Thep213building shook again , a violent , sideways hopping , and I heard somethingfall and break in the kitchen . " What 's broken ? " Rehur asked . I glanced at him , surprised he should worry about the para'an 's possessions , then realized he had meant something else entirely . " The Seam 's open , " Guil answered , scanning the comnet 's screen , " and the Heartlight . The Old Forge is quiet , and so 's Big Bertha over in the Axtell Mandate . But I do n't see any signs why we should be feeling it . " The Seam was the line of volcanic islands that marked a plate boundary in the middle of the Deeps , Orestes ' larger ocean . It was regularly active during syzygy , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Heartlight . But Destiny was situated well away from all the known fault lines ... . Guil said , " Wait , here we go . " She read from the words crawling across her screen . " The Lower Tolands fault is showing strain , and there have been several minor tremors with their epicenter in the Grand Shallows just south of the Toland Point . Inhabitants of the Jan and Brandr Holdings in the Brandr Mandate , the Charlot Holding in Fyfe Mandate , and Halex Holding in Halex Mandate , are advised to take yellow-warning precautions . Be sure to have drinking water on hand , et cetera , et cetera . " " It 's going to be a bad close-passage , " Alkres said , sounding subdued . " The port , Guil , " Leith said . " Is it closed ? " The para'an had already cleared her screen , and was typing an inquiryinto the ' net . " Damn it , yes . " She swung around to face us . " There 's no choice  --  no one will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " If you ca n't , " Leith said , " I can . " She turned her head slowly , including all of us in her challenging stare . Pretense or not , I was very glad of her confidence . " I 've done it in worse conditions , " she went on . " And I can get us a ship . " Guil stirred at that . " Not Pipe Major  --  she 's too big and clumsy . " " One of the tugs , " Leith said . " I can do it . " " One-armed ? " Guil asked , very quietly . " If you 'll copilot . " Leith waited , and slowly , the Para an nodded . Leith swung around again , catching us all in her glance . " Who 's with me , then ? "  |p214I  had a sudden feeling of being caught up , not in a holoplay , but in one of the military films that were so popular on the Urban Worlds . For the first time , I understood their popularity : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the superior knowledge , so natural to answer with the proper line . I 'm with you , Captain . I realized abruptly that someone had said it . Alkres was standing now , face flushed and eager , ready to follow Leith #o the end of this world . " Good boy , " Leith said , and looked at Guil . The pars ' an nodded again . " And me . " My answer was next , according to whatever crazy script we were following , and quite suddenly I knew I did n't want to break with it . Leith did know what she was doing , even if she 'd chosen cheap films for her model . She was giving us our only real chance to buy time and maybe escape from the trap the Brandr had set for the Halex . I said , as I must , " We 'll do it your way , Leith . " That left only Rehur . I glanced at him , and saw him staring at us , half incredulous , half hysterically amused , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pushed himself up out of his chair , favoring his injured arm , and said , " Sorry , people , not me . " I recognized the part , and my own laughter died . He was playing the native leader , the resistance worker , the infiltrator , the one who stays behind to fight the good fight  --  the second lead , always , the one who dies . He glanced at me sidelong , slow and mocking , and I knew he 'd chosen it deliberately . " Oh ? " That was Leith , preternaturally calm . " That 's right . " The building trembled again , less violently than either of the other tremors , but Rehur steadied himself against the nearest chair . " I 'd be endangering Alkres . Look , I 'm still dead , at least to him , and he ca n't risk breaking code . It 's a thirty-six-hour flight to Electra , even at close approach , and if he 's shut up all that time in a little tug with me and three other people who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be before he accidentally breaks code ? We ca n't risk it . He was right , and I paid him the compliment of feeding him his cue . " What will you do ? " " I 'll go back to the Necropolis , " he answered , steadily . " Ume-Kai 'll take me in . Together we might be able to arrange some support for you , when you return . " He crossed to the door , setting his hand onp215the controls , and his solemnity broke suddenly into an impish smile . " Thanks , Trey , " he said , in an entirely new voice . " I never played second lead before . " He put fingers to his lips , still smiling , and was gone . The others were looking at me with varying degrees of confusion and annoyance . Before anyone could ask , I said , " We 'd better get moving , Leith . " It did n't take long to gather our belongings : an extra tunic and undershirt for Alkres , borrowed from Guil , along with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of clothes for the tug pilot ; Leith 's campaign bag . I had my IDs and the clothes I stood up in , and was lucky to have that much ; I would 've been glad of a change of clothes , but Guil and I were not of a size . The streets were unexpectedly crowded , the various squares in particularfilled with people . In the rising light from Agamemnon , I could see that many of them carried chairs and folding lounges , or packed heated sleepsacks . Taking shelter from the earthquakes , I realized abruptly , watching a woman place a baby into a free-standing heated cradle . Despite Destiny 's strict construction laws , people seemed to feel safer out from under the buildings . The tremors had brought us some good after all : it would be very hard to spot one more " family group " among the moving , nervous crowds . Guil led us toward the port by the back streets , through the residentialprecincts , paralleling the High Street , but never venturing onto its dangerously well-lit width . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crowded now with people from the neighboring precincts , we saw a group of Branch soldiers , but they seemed more concerned with the trio of enterprising shopkeepers who had chosen to set up business out of pushcarts at the entrance to the square , and we slipped through without being noticed . As we got closer to the port , Guil 's pace slackened , and I saw her exchange glances with Leith . The captain nodded thoughtfully . " You 're thinking of the bridges ? " " Yeah . " Guil frowned , and drew us to a stop in the lee of a windowlesswarehouse . There had n't been any tremors for some time now , but still I had to make a real effort to keep myself from stepping out of that looming shadow . I turned my back on the brick walls , but that was worse . I could practically feel their potential weight , a breathing , hovering menace.  | " They 're bound to be watching , " Gull went on . Leith rubbed her gloved wrist . " You and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prove it . Trey 's obviously an off-wonder  --  or you will be , Trey , if you take off that cape of yours . You said you managed to pass Alkres off as your own son ? " " Yes , but that was before they were sure Alkres was alive , " I answered . " They must 've gotten a photo of him by now , sent it to all the troops . " " Not necessarily , " Leith said . " They 're pretty disorganized . " Alkres tugged at my sleeve . " The last formal picture I was in was taken a couple of calendar-years ago . I 've grown a lot since then . " That would make a difference , I thought , and nodded . Children change quickly , especially at his age . " I think you can pull it off , then , " the captain went on . She took a step back , surveying us with narrowed eyes . " Let Guil wear your cloak , and take off those gloves . " Reluctantly , I did as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' an and stuffing the gloves into my pocket . It was very cold without them  --  I had been spoiled by the heavy furs . Leith nodded to herself , still staring , then bent and rummaged one-handed through her campaign bag . At last she straightened with an exclamation of triumph , and held out a battered leather hat , brimless , with an almost unreadable unit pin clipped to one side . Alkres took it warily . " Wear that , " Leith continued , " and get rid of your gloves and belt  --  here , I 'll take them . " Alkres complied without protest , and Leith stowed his belongings in the depths of her campaign bag . Almost as an afterthought , she pulled out her service blaster and belted it around her waist beneath her coat . She glanced again at Alkres , and tugged the hat a little lower over the boy 's eyes . " Well , " she said , " you look a little more like a off-wonder now . " I studied the ult'eir with less confidence . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make any origins pretty obvious  --  unless , of course , I 'm wearing something as loose-fitting as my furry cloak  --  but Alkres was slightly built . Even letting the heavy tunic hang unbelted did n't give him the needed breadth of shoulder . Leith saw my expression and shrugged as if to say , " What else can we do ? " Guil said , " We 'd better get going . " Even as she spoke , the ground trembled underfoot . It was a weaker tremor than the others had been ,  |p217barely  strong enough to be felt , but we all stepped hurriedly out of the warehouse 's shadow . Guil gave Leith another quick glance . " " Can you lift under these conditions ? " " I told you , yes , " Leith answered , and smiled . " Trust me . " " I do , " the pars ' an muttered , but not happily . She pointed toward the cross street ahead of us . " " We 'll have to take the main bridge . " The High Street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through : we had left the residential precincts behind . Still , there were a few people camped out on the pedestrian strip that edged the tram line . The trams themselves had stopped running . One was stopped just below the bridge turntable , and I could see people stretched out in its uncomfortable seats . The end of the bridge was bathed in the harsh light of a portable searchlight , and there were people in battledress in the shadows beyond . Fortunately , they were n't preventing traffic across the bridge  --  why should they , when the port itself was closed ? I caught Alkres 's hand in mine , and whispered again , " Do n't say anything if you can help it . Act shy . " " I will , " the ult'eir whispered back , and tightened his grip on my hand . Leith advanced on the bridge as though she had n't seen the soldiers , and we followed , Guil hanging back a bit . As we stepped into the circle of light , a voice said , " Hold it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself , was little more than a long shadow distorted by the harness and power pack of an electric rifle . I paused at the edge of the circle , keeping Alkres a little behind me . Leith said , " " What 's the problem now ? " Her voice held just the right mix of impatience and worry . " What 's your business at the port ? " the guard asked again . " My ship 's there , " Leith answered . " Look , who are you to be ask-ing ? " Alkres 's hand tightened on mine , and there was an indistinct mutterfrom one of the other soldiers waiting in the shadows . The woman  --  presumably the officer in command of the detail  --  made a curt , chopping gesture , one hand flashing briefly in the light . " We 're supplementing the regular police force , " she said smoothly . " You know the port 's closed ? " Leith nodded . " My name 's Moraghan . I 'm captain of Pipe Majorp218the six-week mailship . We 're not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how she 'll handle the shaking . " Without being asked , she profferedher ID disk . The guard officer took it , examined it for a moment , then passed it back again . The rainbow whorls of a Conglomerate-forces ID are supposed to be impossible to duplicate . She turned her attention to me . " Are you with her ? " Leith said , " They 've asked for hardship passage out . I said I 'd see if we had cabin space . " " Is that right ? " The guard officer 's eyes did n't waver from my face . " That 's right , " " I said . I fell back into the persona I 'd used to enter Destiny , without stopping to think if it would be recognized . " My name 's Mas Zeeman ; this is my son Tannis . " " Your papers ? " I scowled . " I 've told you people before , I do n't have them any more . They burned up with the Halex Tower  --  no thanks to anybody we did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us for a moment longer , then motioned us forward into the light . I did as I was told , drawing Alkres after me . The boy had the sense not to try to hide his face , but he shrank against me . I put my arm around his shoulders , feeling his tension , and wondered if he could hear my heartbeat . Leith had her hand very deep in the pocket of her coat  --  and then I realized it was no pocket , but a gun slit , and her hand was on the butt of her service blaster . It would be suicide , against half a dozen electric rifles . After a moment , Leith seemed to realize that , too , and very slowly eased her hand out of the pocket . " Well ? " The guard officer spoke without turning , but it was clear she was n't talking to us . Another soldier leaned forward , saying something in a low voice . I caught only a couple of words  --  " photos , " and then , " do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " All right , all right . Much use you are . " She put her hands on her hips , still frowning . " You three , you can pass . You , blondie , give me your name and business . " " Gull , ex-Tam'ne , para ' an of Tam'ne in Orillon , " the pilot answered , rather wearily . " I 'm a tug pilot with the Port Authority . My instructions are to show up when we get a yellow alert from the Geo/ Met Office . " It took all my strength to not look back as I followed Leith throughp219the knot of soldiers onto the bridge itself . Gull 's tone suggested she did n't particularly care whether she made it to the port or not , and I hoped the guard officer would accept her story . " Captain ! " I was close enough to Leith to hear the sharp intake of breath . When she turned , however , face and voice were under perfect control . " Yes ? " She was polite , but there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Do you know her ? " the guard officer asked , and jerked a thumb at Guil . Leith gave me one sidelong glance , then took two steps back down the bridge toward the searchlight . " Yeah , I think so . Yes , she 's brought Pipe Major in a couple of times . " She waited with ostentatious patience while the guard officer gnawed her lip . One of the soldiers muttered something , and the officer snapped to her decision . " All right , you can pass , pars . " Guil gave a sigh , and hurried through the patch of light . Leith said loudly , meaning to be overheard , " If you 're going to the port , Guil , why do n't you walk with us ? " " Thanks , Captain , " Guil said , as loudly , and we walked on . The bridge seemed very dark after the brillance of the searchlight . Agamemnon 's cold light reflected eerily from the fencing that curved up and over the walkway , closing us off from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The strip-lights that hung at intervals along the fence itself barely seemed to affect the ghostly radiance . The Ostlaer was very loud beneath us . I hoped there would n't be any more tremorswhile we were on the bridge . Then we had passed the midpoint of the bridge , and started down the slope toward the port . Another tram was halted on the line just beyond the protective wall , its lights pointing ahead to the port 's main entrance . There was no sign of any guard there , and I gave a sigh of relief . " I did n't really think there would be , " Leith said , " not with the Authority worried about off-world traffic all the time , but I 'm glad to see I was right . " " You and me both , " I said . We negotiated the turnstiles at the base of the bridge  --  the Port Authority preferred people to enter the port area by the tramlines  --  then followed the line toward the open gate.  |p220The  tram was empty , abandoned , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was very different from the situation in the city itself , and I frowned . " Where is everybody ? " " Inside , I hope , " ' Leith answered . " The port buildings are supposed to be earthquake-proof , " Gull said , with only the lightest emphasis on the word " supposed . " She looked at Leith . " Should we check the pilots ' lounge first ? " The captain nodded . " And then transients ' quarters . I want to find my crew . " The main lobby , with its uncomfortable pressed-foam chairs , was comparatively empty , occupied mostly by people waiting to use the autobank in the far corner . The upper floor , with its maze of offices , waiting rooms , and private lounges , was far more crowded . Offworldcrews and off-worlders alarmed by the attack on the Tower mingled with Gull 's colleagues from the tugs and the short-range lighters . Most of the crowd seemed to have resigned themselves to a long wait . The lucky ones , the ones whose guild or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sleep there , in comfort if not in privacy ; the rest  --  the vast majority , from what I could see  --  were considering themselves fortunate to stake a claim to one of the padded benches that dotted the corridors . I was n't too surprised . The Oresteian trade would be very small compared to the usual Urban runs , except during the brief wool season . It would n't pay the smaller unions to keep quarters here . We turned a corner , stepping around a dice game that was overflowinga cleaner 's alcove , and Leith swore . " So much for getting to check the boards . " I looked over her shoulder , and ducked hastily back around the corner , almost tripping over one of the dice players . There was a crowd outside the main scheduling office , a crowd that held any number of familiar faces : the other off-wonders who 'd worked for the Halex were still on-planet , stranded by the earthquakes . Alkres said , " What 's wrong ? " " People from the Tower , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low . " Leith , we ca n't risk being seen . " Already , a couple of the dice players were looking up at us with something more than idle curiosity . The captain nodded abruptly . " Right , this way . "  |p221We  retraced our steps through the crowded corridors . When Leith hesitated , Gull took over , leading us down a flight of stairs and through a series of badly lit maintenance corridors . Finally , we emerged from that tangle at another stairway , and Gull nodded to it . " The pilots ' lounge 's at the top , " she said . " Just who are you looking for , Leith ? " " A man named Trivally Rhawn , " the captain answered , and started up the stairs . " He 's the maintenance supervisor for the tugs  --  " " I know that , " Gull growled . Leith went on as if she had n't spoken . " We 're decent friends , though he 's a better friend to my pilot , and he owes me a favor or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me take a ship . " Alkres stirred at my side , then stopped abruptly , staring up the stairs . " He 's a Rhawn , " he protested . " He 's a spacer first , " Leith answered , cutting off Gull 's automatic answer . Alkres looked dubiously at me , and I nodded , projecting all the confidence I could muster . " Leith knows the port . I think we should do it . " " Very well , " the ult'eir said , with unconscious arrogance . Gull 's lips thinned , but Leith gave a lopsided smile . " Right , then , " she said . " Let 's go . " The pilots ' lounge was busy , which I had gathered from Leith was an unusual state of affairs . We paused just inside the doorway , pretending to look for a table while Leith scanned the crowd . The darkly paneled room was dimly lit , shutters closed tight against the cold of the Dark . After the bright corridors , it was hard to see . " Captain Moraghan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't the voice she 'd been expecting . She controlled herself instantly , and turned toward the speaker , saying , " Darah ? What 're you doing here ? " " Same thing you are , I bet , sir . " The speaker was tall , for an offworlder , and very dark . The plate and rosette of an artificial eye almostfilled one side of his face . " I was worried about how the Major 'd stand the shaking . " " How is it ? " Leith asked . " Pretty well . The shocks and gyros 're holding nicely . " He was looking us over with frank curiosity , greeting Gull with a smile and a nod , and Leith sighed  | " Darah , I want you to meet some friends of mine . Gull , you know already  --  " " How could I forget her ? " the stranger murmured , with a thoroughlysexy smile . Leith ignored him . "  --  and this is Trey Maturin , a Conglomerate Mediator , and Alkres Halex . People , this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had vanished from Sabas 's face . " Alkres Ha  --  " He broke off abruptly , glancing over his shoulder , and lowered his voice almost to a whisper . " The kid  --  You have n't gotten mixed up in local politics , have you , Captain ? " Leith ignored that question , too . " Is your friend Trivally around ? " " Yeah . " Sabas shook himself and tried to recover his earlier banteringstyle . " He 's right here  --  at the corner table . We were hoping for some privacy . " " I want to talk to him . " Leith gave Sabas a measuring look . " And I 'll need your help , too , Darah . " " You got it , sir , " Sabas said , for once without pretense . " Over here . " The man at the corner table looked up , frowning , at our approach , but then he saw Alkres , and his expression changed to one of appalledrecognition . He started to say something , but Sabas cut him off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Captain Moraghan ? She wants to talk to us . " Trivally glanced from Sabas to the captain , then fixed his eyes again on Alkres . " What about ? " he asked warily . " The port 's closed . " There was a single empty chair at the next table . Leith appropriated it with a word of apology  --  the couple at the other table , locked in a lingering kiss , hardly seemed to notice , but then the man gave an offhand wave and the woman broke free long enough to murmur an agreement  --  and swung it around to face the Oresteian . She seated herself and leaned forward , both forearms on the table , right hand pinning her left arm in place . Trivally , a brown-skinned , flat-faced man , watched her with a sort of fascination . " I need your help , " Leith said , quietly enough that her voice did not carry to the neighboring tables . Gull leaned casually against the back of the captain 's chair , ice-blue eyes slitted in menace . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Trivally said again . In the same instant , Sabas said , " A ship ? " " Shut up , Darah , " Leith said , and was obeyed . She turned her attentionback to the supervisor . " All that means to me is that you 've got lots of ships on the ground , Maintenance Supervisor Rhawn . I want one of them  --  emergency business . " Trivally 's eyes slid again to Alkres , standing now at my left hand . Leith nodded . " That 's right , " she said . " You know who he is . " " I ca n't do it , " Trivally said again . " I 'm sorry , Captain , it 's just not possible . It 's as much as my job is worth  --  and you 're not even one of us . Leith frowned , and I said , " Leith . " The captain quieted instantly , and Gull gave me a curious look . I kept myself from smiling with an effort . This was a situation well covered by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my  --  to Alkres 's  --  advantage . It was a very pleasant feeling . " Trivally Rhawn , " I said , deliberately , " my name is Maturin . The Halex Medium . I call on you in the Kinship 's name to help your patriarch . " Trivally looked at me with slowly widening eyes . I was implicitly threatening him with an accusation of code breaking  --  with death  --  and while there might seem to be little I could do to enforce my sanction , I was his Kinship 's senior Medium , protector of his genarch . The code gave me rights and powers I did n't think he would be able to withstand . After a moment , he looked away , and I felt a surge of elation . " The port 's still closed , " the supervisor protested . " I can give you a ship , sure , but you ca n't go anywhere . " " Oh , yes , I can , " Leith said with a savage smile , and Trivally threw up his hands . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . " Medium , I  --  " He broke off abruptly , sighing , and bowed his head in submission . " As Himself wishes , Medium . So be it . " " Thank you , " I said . " Yes , thank you , " Alkres said . " You do a lot to make up for Yslin . " " Yslin ! " Trivally 's mouth contorted as though he were about to spit . " Sor , not all of us follow him , not even in the Rhawn Branch . Do n't go off-world . We need you , to fight back . "  | " I 'm not going far , " Alkres answered . " just to Electra  --  and I 'll be back . Will you wait for me ? " " We 'll wait , " Trivally answered fervently . It was another scene from the h8loplays , and I cleared my throat , breaking the spell . " How soon can we leave ? The Brandr were on our heels . " " At once , " Trivally answered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him from the bar , Sabas , in the rear , voicing some unintelligible protest . As we came out into the corridor , the words came clear . " What about Pipe Major , Captain ? " Leith gave him an unloving grin . " She 's all yours , Darah . To my mind , this is a class-one emergency , and I 'm still under the Oath . I have to do this . " " But  --  " Leith turned on him , her stare freezing him in his tracks . " Even if it was n't a matter for the Oath , do you think I could leave them to manage ? I 'm needed here , a lot more than I ever was on the ship . " She took a deep breath , fighting for control , and said , more calmly , " You have command of Pipe Major , Darah . I 'll give you that in writing , if you want . " Sabas shook his head , his handsome face very sober . " That wo n't be necessary , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'll take over til you return . And good luck , sir . " Leith 's expression eased a little , and she said , softly , " I misjudged you , Darah . Take care of things . " " I will , " the pilot answered , but Leith had n't waited for his reply . We left the pilot standing in the corridor , shaking his head . The supervisor led us down another long staircase , and then into the maze of tunnels that connected the port buildings . We walked for some time through the white-painted halls  --  I had no idea where we were in relation to the main building  --  and then emerged , with startlingsuddenness , in the Port Authority hangar . It was a huge building , the ceiling at least three stories above our heads , the far wall almost infinitely distant in the poor lighting . Six of the slim lighters stood with their noses to the dock ports , apparently just waiting to be towed onto the taxiway ; a seventh ship  --  one of the squat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the end of the row . All were attached with multiple umbilicals top225installations in the walls . Trivally waved his hand resignedly at the line of ships . " Which one do you want , Captain ? " His voice echoed oddly in the vast emptiness . Leith rubbed her wrist again , staring at the waiting ships . Before she could answer , however , there was the sound of a door opening and closing somewhere in the hangar , and a voice called , " Who 's there ? Is that you , Triv ' ? " " One of my technicians , " Trivally said hastily , in an undertone . " She 's a Halex , too . " He lifted his voice . " Over here , Nezera ! " A figure emerged from the shadows , tall and thin like all the Oresteians , and resolved itself into a young woman barely older than Rehur , with a mane of black hair swept up and back into an untidy topknot . There was a wildness in her face that reminded me of Ixora . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a little warily , her eyes sweeping over us . " You probably should n't be bringing people here in a yellow alert  --  " " Never mind that , " Trivally said . The woman shrugged , and said , with deliberate malice , " It 's your funeral . " " Nezera , " Trivally said firmly , " Himself has asked for my help , and I 'm charging you , on guild-oath as well as the blood tie , to help me . " " Himself ? " Nezera 's eyes fixed on Alkres , and widened slowly . " I beg pardon , sor , I did n't know you at first . All the pictures are old  --  " She broke off , flushing , and looked to Trivally . " What do we do , Triv ' ? " Trivally looked at Leith . " Which ship , Captain ? " Leith did n't answer at once , staring down the line of ships with narrowed eyes . " The best of the lighters , I think , " she said , after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in your lineup ? " Trivally shook his head , and looked for a moment almost embarrassed . " I 'm afraid not , Captain . " " No fear , " Nezera muttered . " The best one 's the Koniko , " Trivally said . " She 's not the newest , " Nezera offered , " but we 've never been able to get it to work right . " " I 'll rely on your judgment , " Leith said . " Right . " Trivally rubbed his hands together thoughtfully . " Nez'a ,  |p226run  a pre-flight on the Koniko . Fuel her , top the air tanks if necessary , and make sure the other supplies are in order . " " Got you . " Nezera gave a sketchy sort of salute , and trotted off toward the fourth lighter in the line . More than ever , she reminded me of Ixora , and I wondered if the driver had somehow survived the battle . I did n't even know if she had been at the Tower that night . . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to reality . " Can you do your own course plot ? " the supervisor was saying . " I do n't think it 'd be good to go through the control tower . I 've of a computer in my office , with a pretty good analog of their main rogram . Sometimes people like to look at it while they 're deciding about repairs . . . . " I can take care of that , if you want , " Gull offered . Leith hesitated only for an instant . " It 's your system . Thanks . " Trivally beckoned , and Gull started off with him toward the closed door of the supervisor 's office . Alkres said , quite suddenly , " Can I watch ? " He sounded like a fifteen-year-old again , which was something of a relief . I nodded . " If Gull does n't mind . " " I 'll ask , " Alkres promised , and darted after them . A moment later , he had caught up , and I saw Gull shake her head . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , feeling suddenly exhausted again . By Leith 's chronograph , dangling from her belt beneath the open coat , it was well past the twenty-second hour : it was no wonder I was tired . Leith looked drained , too , strong circles showing under her eyes . There was a clattering from the line of ships , and she looked up sharply , focusingon something I could n't find , but then she relapsed into her suddenapathy . We stood silent for a long moment . Then , glancing sideways at Leith , I said , " I know why I 'm doing this . " The captain looked up at me , and ran her good hand through her hair . She was smiling faintly . " Oh , well . You heard what I told Darah . It 's a matter of the Peacekeepers ' Oath  --  and even if it was n't , I could n't just leave you here . " The Oath bound the Peacekeepers  --  even those who 'd left active service , like Moraghan  --  to intervene in situations that could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to choose thep227most effective form of intervention , as the Peacekeepers ' Supreme Command quite reasonably held they could n't dictate specific actions in such an emergency , and the actions prompted by that part of the Oath had varied widely . Jan Migisi , during the bloody uprising on Brigit , had assassinated the leaders of the three radical parties , and persuaded the survivors to call for mediation ; Chang Loris , facing a similar situation on Cratos , had settled for rescuing the leaders of the old guard . Both actions had ultimately been sanctioned by the SupremeCommand . The only consistent thing was the obligation to act when confronted with the possible destruction of a society . " Do you really think things are that bad ? " I asked . Leith smiled , without humor . " Do n't you ? " The thought was profoundly disturbing . I shied away from it , askinginstead , " How dangerous is it really , taking off now ? " Leith shrugged . " Not dangerous at all , unless there 's a tremor just when I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that chance into account , and they ca n't afford to run risks on a large scale , but  --  not really dangerous . " It took Trivally and Nezera less than an hour to get the lighter ready for liftoff , and most of that time was spent pumping fuel into the Koniko 's immense tanks . Guil had the course plotted in about half that time  --  Orestes and Electra were almost in syzygy , an easy plot to make  --  and then we all stood around until at last Trivally signaled he was ready to let us aboard . The Koniko was an old model , with worn padding on the walls of its cylindrical airlock . Nezera took us in , pointing Leith and Guil toward the tiny command capsule , then led Alkres and me into the empty passenger compartment . There were a dozen first-class couches to choose from  --  the ones that folded back into truly comfortablebunks  --  and two dozen of the less luxurious standard-class couches beyond that . Nezera grinned . " You might as well sit up front and be comfortable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a pair of closed compartments , one on each side of the passage leading to the command capsule . " The head 's on the left , galley on the right . You 'll have to serve yourselves , I 'm afraid , but it 's fully stocked . " She paused again , listening to voices in her headset , then said , " Better strap in , now . Trivally 's ready to take her out . " Nezera helped me fasten Alkres into the first couch , then showedp228him how to work the controls while I fastened myself into the couch directly across the aisle from the ult'eir 's . The technician gave me a quick , professional glance , and then an approving nod . " You 're all set , then , Medium . Screen controls  --  " " Under my left hand ? " I asked . " Right . Good luck . " She glanced quickly at Alkres , very pale against the dark-brown padding . " Come back soon and safe , sor . " The boy whispered something in reply , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off-world before , of course , and the first time is always frightening , even in normal circumstances . I wanted to lean across and take his hand , but I was held back by the safety webbing . Instead , I touched the screen controls , and fiddled with the buttons until I 'd found the views from the outside cameras . The wall and the retracted umbilicals were slowly receding : I had n't even realizedwe 'd begun to move . The intercom crackled overhead , and Gull 's voice said , over the mutter of Leith 's checklist , " We 're starting the fans . " The ship shuddered deeply as she spoke , and I was grateful for the warning . Alkres took a deep breath , his hands closed tight on the ends of the armrests , but said nothing . In the screen , the side wall swung away as the pilots turned to face the hangar doors . They were sliding back already , and clicked into place as the ship steadied into the taxiway . A distant voice spoke in the intercom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pass the yellow line before you start main engines . " It was Trivally . He sounded more than a little nervous , usurping Traffic Control 's job , but at least there was no other traffic to worry about . " Affirmative , " Gull answered . Her voice was much louder , and I guessed she 'd forgotten to switch off the passenger intercom . I could still hear the sexless voice of the computer , running through the last bit of the pilot 's checklist , and Leith 's monosyllabic responses . " Should n't there be another crewman ? " Alkres asked suddenly . " An engineer , or something ? " He looked genuinely frightened again , and I said quickly , " The computer does that on this ship , I think  --  I 'm sure of it . " " Oh . " Alkres leaned back in his couch , trying very hard to relax . " It 'll be all right , " I said . " Remember , this is a low-G planet , so the lift 's nothing to worry about . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take a lot of it . "  |p229He  hunched his shoulders a little under the webbing , and did n't answer . I wondered if it would n't be better to leave him alone , and looked back at the screen . The Koniko was just passing through the hangar entrance , ground fans whining very softly . Ahead stretched the vast expanse of the taxiway , and then the runway itself , both still outlined with lights , even though the port was officially closed . A yellow band , gleaming in the Koniko 's headlights , marked the end of the taxiway and the beginning of the runway . Leith 's voice said , " Oh , they 're getting nervy , are n't they ? " Gull laughed , and the captain said , more sharply , " No , do n't answer . Let them sweat . " I guessed she was talking about the control tower . Leith 's voice sounded again , once more smoothly professional . " Give me full power on the ground fans , please . " " Ground fans at full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the well-shielded passenger cabin did n't seem to increase , but in the screen , the marker lights began to move past more quickly . " I do n't like the looks of those vans , Leith , " the Para an went on . " Let them play chicken if they want , " Leith answered promptly . " I 'll overrun them if I have to . " " If you can , " Gull said . Leith laughed . " I can . " The Koniko 's cameras were fixed , pointing straight ahead . I would 've given anything to be able to adjust them , to see what the two pilots were talking about  --  or to be able to ask them directly , for that matter  --  but the intercom was a one-way instrument . The controltower must 've sent out its emergency equipment to try to block the runway , I thought . At least I know the Destiny field does n't have gunboxes  --  unless the Brandr brought some with them ? That was an appalling thought , and I could feel the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ results only too easily : one missile among the Koniko 's fuel tanks , and there would be even less left of us than there was of the people at the Tower . I brought myself under control with an effort . Even if the Brandr had equipment to spare for the supposedly closed spaceport  --  and there had been no word of missile launchers or gunboxes of any kind in the rumors we had heard before the attack  --  there were still Halex in the control tower who could , and would , stop them from attacking too quickly.  |p230In  the screen , the yellow line had just v4ished beneath the Koniko 's nose . Guil gave a grunt of satisfaction . " They 're dropping back . " " I thought they would , " Leith answered absently . " Computer , commence checklist for main engine start . " At that moment , the ship shuddered , the entire world staggering drunkenly sideways . Alkres gave a little yelp of fright , and Guil swore viciously . In the background , I could hear the computer droningthrough its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no answer , repeated it . Leith said , unnecessarily , " Tremor . " Her voice was not quite steady . " Do we scrub ? " Guil asked . There was a long silence , broken only by the computer 's monotonousvoice . Then Leith said , " No . " " Aftershocks , " Guil said , warningly , and Leith interrupted . " There have n't been any before . I 'll chance it . " Her voice faded , as though she 'd turned away again . " Feed cock open . " The computer continued its list as though there had been no pause . At last , I heard its voice announce , " Ready for main engine start . All systems at standby . Brakes full on . " " Brakes full on , " Leith echoed . " Beginning main engine start . " Guil said , pitching her voice to reach the intercom microphone , " We 're beginning the count , people . Main engines 're starting  --  now . " Her words were drowned in the sudden burst of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shook under the sudden rush of power , and I saw  --  I could barely hear anything , over the roar of the engines  --  Alkres 's mouth open in another frightened cry . I shouted , not knowingif he would hear , " It 's a normal start . Do n't worry ! " Then , quite suddenly , the engines hit their takeoff point , and one of the pilots snapped off the brakes . The Koniko bounded forward , the runway lights blurring almost instantly into a single line . We bounced , and then the Koniko 's nose rose steeply , and we were gone . The cameras showed only featureless sky , the stars drowned in Agamemnon'slight , but I could imagine the starport dropping away beneathus . The acceleration increased steadily , pressing me back into my couch . The cushions molded themselves around me , taking some of the strain . Still , it was n't pleasant , and I turned my head with an effort , trying to see how Alkres was handling it . The Patriarch was flattened in his couch , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a stem mask . He was coping in his own way , and I turned my head back toward the featureless screen . The pressure and the engine noise stopped together . In the sudden silence , Leith said , " In the groove . " " Confirmed , " Gull answered . " Everything all right back there , Trey ? " I glanced at Alkres , who nodded . His movements were cautious in the lack of gravity  --  wisely so , I thought , remembering my own first bout with spacesickness . " So far , so good , " I said , and then remembered that the intercom was one-way . Carefully , I unfastened my webbing and let myself drift up off the couch , feeling my way toward the galley where I knew there would be a crew intercom . It took me a few minutes to get there  --  I had n't been in a spaceship that lacked internal gravity in some time , and I had lost my space legs  --  and another few minutes to find and figure out the intercom system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and said , " We 're all right , thanks . How re things up front ? " " Pretty good , " Leith answered . She still sounded excited , exhilaratedby the liftoff . " We 're on course , and should reach Electra in about thirty-six hours , give or take thirty minutes  --  I ' 11 know for sure when we hit the correction point . Nobody 's following us  --  " " I 'm not surprised , " I said , and Leith laughed . " No , that tremor would tend to discourage them . And even if someone does decide to risk the lift , we 'll have about an hour 's head start . " That head start would increase the longer any pursuers waited , too . I said , " Sounds good to me . Let me know if you want anything from the galley , or if I can spell somebody . If not , I 'm going back to the kid . " " Good idea , " Leith said . " I 'll let you know if we need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bar , and started toward the galley door . I had my hand on its latch when a thought struck me , and I turned back toward the row of storage cells . It was n't hard to find the Koniko 's aidkit  --  the cell was marked with the red cross , star , and crescent  --  and I pawed through the sterile packets until I found the one I wanted . I tucked it into my tunic pocket , and headed back to the cabin . Alkres was very pale , his forehead damp with clammy sweat , but he managed a ghastly smile as I pulled myself back down the corri/dor . Already , it was getting easier to move Ih the lack of gravity , and I swung myself into position beside Alkres 's couch with a sort of grace . " I 'm glad everything 's going right , " the patriarch said faintly . " You look awful , " I said . " Are you feeling spacesick ? " Alkres started to nod , and thought better of it . " Yes . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my pocket , and hooked my foot under the grab bar at the base of his couch to steady myself before ripping open the sterile paper . The injection cylinder started to float away , and I caught it awkwardly . " By rights , you should 've gotten a time-patch before we left , but this was hardly a well-planned trip . We 're lucky the stewards keep these aboard , just in case . " Alkres was watching me warily , and I plunged on , hoping to distract him . " The injection will make you feel better almost at once , and by the time it wears off , the patch will have taken over . All right ? " " All right , " Alkres said , and turned his head very carefully away as I pressed the head of the cylinder against his skin . The check-bead at the end of the cylinder went from red to clear as the cylinder emptied , and I pulled it away , tucking it into a pocket . " I do feel better , " Alkres said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but he was moving his head a little less gingerly . I smiled , and took the square adhesive pouch out of the aid pack . " I 'm going to put this on your wrist , over the surface veins , " I said , suiting my actions to my words . " You may feel a little itching , or maybe not ; it 's nothing to worry about either way . " I finished wrappingthe security tabs around the boy 's wrist , and let myself float away again . " That should last you for the trip . Now , if you can sleep , that 's the best thing . It 'll give the medicines a chance to work . " " Thanks , Trey , " Alkres said . " I 'll try . " He leaned back in the couch , closing his eyes . I pulled myself back to my couch , and fastened the webbing around me again . I was exhausted , and there was nothing I could do to help , at least for the next few hours . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smoothly . By the time I woke , we were well into the rings , on a well-buoyed track that Gull assured me she could fly in her sleep . The para'an had chosen a somewhat roundabout course in order to make use of that partial gap , adding an extra five hours to the journey as we passed the rings , and then turned to chase Electra along her orbit . Even I knew that this was the sort of maneuverthat ate into the fuel reserves , but when I voiced that worry , Leith only laughed and reminded me that the Koniko was running virtually empty . There was plenty of fuel to spare . I did my best to make myself useful , preparing meals from the galley 's limited stock  --  not much of a chore , just adding hot water to pouches of freeze-dried foods  --  and sitting in while one or the other of the pilots snatched a few hours ' sleep . That was n't a particularly difficult job , either , and Alkres took his turn at it as well once he adjusted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , first a blue-white point small enough to be eclipsed by any piece of ring debris , then a disk the size of my thumbnail with distinctblue-and-white markings , and finally , as we left the rings , a world the size of my palm , with distinct seas and a single snowy continent beneath the swirling clouds . Six hours out of Glittermark , the first-approach buoy hailed us . The signal , coming in over the open intercom , woke me instantly . Ip234struggled free of the safety webbing and was halfway to the commandcapsule before I had fully realized what I was doing . Alkres was n't far behind . We had discussed what to do  --  when to ask the Orillon Patriarch for sanctuary  --  a dozen times before this , but we had n't come to any firm decision . Now the decision point was at hand . The pilots exchanged glances as I swung to a stop , floating just inside the hatchway . Alkres , who fitted more neatly into the commandcapsule 's limited space , pushed past me to catch the nearest grab @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the registry transponder , preventing its automatic answer . Leith said , " Well , Trey ? " I took a deep breath , the previous days ' arguments flashing through my mind . It would probably be to our advantage to present the OrillonPatriarch with a fait accompli  --  under the code , he could not refuse to shelter Alkres  --  but at the same time , I did n't want to insult him by forcing his hand . Still , we were only six hours out of Electra 's only city . That would give him sufficient notification , but would n't give him much time to think up an excuse to refuse us . We could always broadcast later requests , if we had to appeal to public opinion  --  and that seemed unlikely . After all , the Orillon Patriarch had been the only genarch to protest the Brandr action . I nodded to Gull . " Go ahead and answer . Tell them you want a line to the Tower , but see if you can go through check-down first . " " That 's standard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her hand off the abort button . Immediately , lights rippled across the transponder 's checkplate , recording both the buoy 's inquiry and our answer in the Koniko 's automatic log . Leith watched the main communications board . We waited while the buoy digested our registry codes , discoveredno incoming flight that matched those numbers , and passed its dilemma on the Glittermark field . Ten minutes clicked by on the capsule'schronograph before the signal panel lit : it seemed Glittermark had been taken by surprise . Leith touched keys , matching frequencies , and the pinlight went from orange to green . " Open channel , " she said softly , warningly , and hit a second button . A light changed color , and after a moment , a soft female voice said , " Koniko 573 , we do n't show a scheduled landing . What 's up ? " Glittermark field was obviously an informal operation . Guil ges/tured rapidly at the communications board . Leith shrugged , and touched another key sequence . The para ' an adjusted her headset microphone , and said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Guil ? " The field operator controlled her response instantly . " This is Kame Orillon . " " It 's Guil , " the para ' an said . " I did n't think we 'd be this lucky . I 'm bringing in an unscheduled launch . Can you give me field space ? " There was a silence , and Guil took advantage of the moment to cover her microphone with one hand . " Kame 's a cross-cousin of mine , " she said , softly . " That 's a break . " " That 's an affirmative on field space , and on a first-approach landing , " Kame said . " Are you in trouble , Guil ? " " Not me , exactly , " Guil began , and the field operator broke in . " Are you messing in the troubles on the big world ? " I bit back a laugh . Electra was supposed to be under the same code that stifled Orestes , yet here was a field operator  --  a Family member , neither Para ' an nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mere " trouble on the big world . " Maybe it was just because Electra was held by a single Family , but I felt my spirits rise for the first time since leaving Orestes . " In a manner of speaking , " Guil said , and looked almost embarrassed . " I want to contact the Tower , after we 've matched coordi-nates . " There was another brief silence . When Kame spoke again , the teasingnote was gone from her voice . " And who will I say 's calling , then ? " Gull glanced at me . I touched my chest then pointed at Alkres . The para ' an nodded , and said , " Trey Maturin , Medium for the Halex Family , for Alkres Halex , of Halex , in Halex . " The speaker whistled painfully , and I waited for Leith to adjust the frequency , before I realized the noise had come from Glittermark . " When you play , you play big , I 'll give you that , " Kame said at last . Her voice sharpened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Koniko 573 , but we 'll match coordinates first . " " I confirm , " Gull answered . " Baseline course ? " Glittermark said , and I let myself drift back through the command capsule 's hatch . Leith detached herself from her couch and followed , pointing for Alkres to take her place in frontp236of the consoles . The patriarch did as he was told , his expression at once determined and uncertain . Leith caught herself outside the galley entrance , and hooked one foot through a floor bar so that she could stretch a little . I waited . At last , the captain said , not looking at me , " Exactly what are you going to ask him for , Trey ? " I had been asking myself the same question for the past thirty-six hours without finding any good answers , and that frustration sharpenedmy voice . " For sanctuary , first , and then for his support at the next Ship 's Council . " Whenever that may be , I added silently . The date had not been set for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least it had n't been set when we left Orestes . I only hoped they had n't met already  --  but that seemed unlikely . It took time to set up these things , even if the Orillon Patriarch was only planning to attend by holo-link . " And if he says no ? " Leith asked . I pulled my mind back to her questions , angry that she kept harping on the uncertainties . " He wo n't . " " He could , " Leith persisted . " What then ? " I took another deep breath . " Grant me I know my business , Leith . Landret Orillon will give us sanctuary , I 'm sure of it . " Leith nodded , lifting a placating hand , and I wished I really were as certain as I 'd sounded . " Do you think he 'll back Alkres in front of the Council , too ? " I shrugged . " That 's less certain , yes , but I think there 's a good chance he might . No one else filed a protest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protest to open support , " Leith began , and I glared at her . This time , she raised both hands in submission . " All right , I trust you . I 'm just worried , that 's all . " I sighed , my anger easing . " Me , too . Call me when you get through to the Tower ? " Leith nodded , and I pulled myself into the passenger compartment . The empty chairs stretched back into eerie shadow  --  the two spacers had turned out the lights in the rear compartment , a power-saving reflex  --  and I was suddenly very lonely . I did n't know for certain if Landret would give us sanctuary , though I was almost certain the code would give him no way of refusing us . But if he did . . . . I could either take the boy out of the system altogether , or I could take him back to Orestes . The former would not appeal to him at all , and Ip237was not happy contemplating the latter . It would probably come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't sure that I could , in good conscience , bully the boy into running out on both the only life he 'd ever known , and his responsibilities to his people . The one thing Urban morality and the Oresteian code have in common is the conceptof responsibility . I turned my back deliberately on those empty , accusing couches , and drew myself down into my own seat , pulling the webbing around me . It was my responsibility to persuade Landret to shelter us . I would not fail in it . An hour passed , then another , and a third . We were well into our second-stage approach before Leith signaled from the command capsulethat the Orillon Tower was on the line . I launched myself out of the couch , and was in the capsule almost before she had finished speaking . Alkres still clung to the strap beside the unused engineer 's panel . Guil said , her hand over her microphone again , " They 'll be on in a few seconds . There 's a headset over there . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . I was still adjusting the boom when the light flashed on the communications board . " Good luck , " Leith whispered , and hit the button . " Koniko 573 , this is Edlin Tam'ne , Orillon Medium , " the speaker answered at once . " I wish to speak to the Halex Medium . " " This is Trey Maturin , " I answered . " I appreciate your responding so promptly . " The woman 's voice lost none of its wariness . " I regret that Himself is in conference at the moment , or I 'm sure he would attend to your business personally . In the meantime , may I be of assistance ? " " I trust so . " I kept my own voice steely calm , not allowing anythingexcept an academic courtesy to color the words . " My request is not of a particularly private nature . I take it you are aware of the recent  --  troubles on Orestes ? " She could n't be anything but aware of them , but I made her answer anyway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Edlin said . " Himself is much con-cerned . " " Yes , to the extent of announcing his intention of filing a protest , " I said . " My employer has asked me to convey his thanks for that cour-tesy. "  | " A matter of duty , " Edlin murmured , even tore warily . She stopped there , wisely , leaving the next move to . I took a deep breath . " My other business is related . I speak for the ult'eir Alkres Halex , of Halex , in Halex , whom we believe presently to be the Halex Patriarch , in lieu of other known survivors from the mainline Family . " That brought a soft gasp from Edlin , as I 'd hoped it would : nothing showed better how far outside the normal bounds of feud and raid the Brandr had stepped . I went on as though I had n't heard . " We ask Landret , as Patriarch of a Kinship not party to this feud , for asylum , one genarch to another . I also ask , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have any word of the other children who were at the Tower . They were taken to the Ansson Hold , but we 've had no chance to hear more of them . " Alkres shot me a grateful look . It had not been safe , in Destiny , to query the comnet , and the newscasts had said nothing . Once we had left Orestes , we had lost access to the ' net . Edlin said , " For the latter , I can set the Patriarch 's mind at rest at once . We had word some twenty hours ago  --  on the main newscast out of Destiny , which would be reliable  --  that those children have been restored to their closest kin . " " Those who have any left , " Alkres muttered . I half hoped the other medium had heard him . " As for the first matter , " Edlin continued , " that is , of course , for Himself to decide . I will place the question before him at once , as genarch to genarch , and will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For the time being , of course , I bid you welcome to Glittermark , and to Electra . " " Thank you for your courtesy and for your gracious assistance , " I answered . " We are most grateful . " Edlin broke the connection then . I sighed , working my shoulders . I had n't realized until then how tense I was . " What 's all that mean ? " Leith asked . " I do n't know for sure , " I answered . " She 's made no promises , though she did give us the run of the city , unofficially . We 'll have to wait for Landret 's decision . " " He 'll take us , " Alkres said . " You 'll see . " " I hope so , " Leith said , but not loudly enough to be heard . In the end , Alkres was right . Edlin barely waited long enough top239keep up the pretense of Landret 's being " in conference " before she came back on line . She brought us the formal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's promise of further  --  if unspecified  --  support . The others were so delighted by that that I did n't have the heart to mention my doubts that it would automatically extend to supporting a Halex claim against a Rhawn upstart in the Ship 's Council . The Orillon Heir , Edlin finished , was by a lucky chance still in Glittermark . Her people would meet us at the starport , and she would personally bring us to the Tower . " That 's good news , " Guil remarked , after the medium had signed off . " Oh ? " I did n't know the Orillon Heir , and said as much . Guil smiled . " Signe Orillon is good people  --  she 's been Portreeve for a few years now . I think she 'll back you , just because this kind of trouble is bad for trade . " Unless , I thought , she 'd rather see the Rhawn into power just to keep things quiet . I did n't say anything , and Alkres said , " I met her , once , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I could n't tell from his tone whether that was supposed to be a recommendation or not . Leith looked up from her multiple screens . " You two had better go back and strap down . We 'll be beginning descent in about forty min-utes . " We did as we were told , and waited out first the forty minutes to entry , and then the interminable descent through Electra 's atmosphere . The viewscreen fuzzed orange almost at once , and did not clear until we were in the final leg , flattening out for the conventional landing at the Glittermark field . Electra was a cold world , colder even than Orestes . The land beneath us was solidly white , a permanent snowfield ; only the heated runways showed dark against the glaring brilliance . I made some hasty calculations : it was Day on Electra , just after Sunrise , with about forty-eight hours to go to their Eclipse . And then we were down . Guil  --  or Leith ; I did n't know for certain who was flying the Koniko  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a jolting crawl across the runways . We turned , lining up on the indicated taxiway , and I caught my first sight of Glittermark . The city lived up to its name . The buildings were short and squat  --  Electra may be less seismically active than Orestes , but there 's still ap240serious danger  --  with steeply pitched roofs that bore permanent crowns of snow . The weak sunlight sparked from the ice that had formed beneath those caps of snow , casting bright reflections across the rows of buildings . They stretched for kilometers in either direction : Glittermark 's residents could not build up , but they could build out . " Oh , it 's pretty , " Alkres said , involuntarily , and I had to agree . The Koniko swung again , and a series of outbuildings , hangars and machinists ' shops , swam into view . Beyond them , I saw what seemed to be a rough-ridged sheet of pure ice , patched here and there with duller spots that must be snow . Agamemnon 's thin crescent hung just above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ familiar colors , bright against the dark sky . Its bow was only a third as big as it appeared from Orestes . Then the main port building slid into the picture , cuttingoff my view . We steadied on a dock marked with a blinking light , and the pilots brought us sedately to a halt beside it . Leith 's voice sounded in the intercom . " Attention , passengers , we have arrived at the gate in Glittermark . Thank you for flying the Escape Line . " Alkres gave a dutiful smile , struggling with his safety webbing . After thirty-six hours of zero gravity , the returned weight was obviouslysomething of a shock . I could n't really feel the difference betweenElectra and Orestes , though I knew there was one , and pulled myself slowly out of my couch . For the first time since I 'd come to Orestes , the gravity actually seemed to have pull . It was not a pleasant sensation , after I had gotten used to trading on my off-world strength . I made a silent promise to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and moved to help Alkres . He wobbled a little when I pulled him to his feet . I supported him as I helped hint unfasten the wrist pouch , and he steadied slowly . In the background , I could hear the pilots ' voices , and the computer 's sexless tones , finishing the docking check . Then , over that background murmur , I heard the chime of the main communications board . The voices stopped , and someone pressed the respond button . A new voice filled the cabins . " Sor Alkres . On behalf of my father , and on my own , I welcome you to Glittermark , and to Electra . " The voice was a woman 's , rather deep , with less of the Oresteian accent than I had expected : Signe , Orillon 's Heir.  |p241There  was a moment of silence after she 'd finished speaking . Then Leith said hastily , " There 's an outside intercom by the hatch . " " Thank you , " Alkres said , though he knew she could n't hear him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found the broadcast button after a moment 's study , and pressed it . " Thank you for your welcome , ama , and for all the kindness your Family 's shown to me . To me and mine , " he amended hurriedly , an anxious frown on his face . I nodded , I hoped encouragingly , and after a moment 's thought , he took his finger off the button . " I think I said everything . " " I think so , " I said , and reached for my cloak , which I had stowed in the cell set into the bulkhead beside the couch . My clothes were looking ragged , despite Leith 's having shown me how to wash the shirt in the zero-g shower ; the magnificent cloak would cover a multitude of sins . Alkres hauled his bag out from the cell just as the two pilots came into the passenger compartment . Both women had on their best to neaten their appearance , but Leith looked acutely grateful for her leather coat . I was glad to see she 'd returned her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The tube 's in place , " she said . " We can pop the hatch whenever you 're ready . " Alkres took a deep breath , and slung the borrowed bag over his shoulder . " " I 'm ready . " His voice quavered a little , but we all ignored it . " Seals are green , " Leith said , automatically . Peacekeeper routines are drilled very deep into the psyche . Gull gave her a rather amused look , but answered , " I confirm , seals are green . " " Opening the hatch , " Leith continued , making a face at her own unnecessary caution , and swung the wheel . The tri-leaved hatch irised , opening onto the docking tube .
