We have entered the era of brand proliferation , the dozens of flavors and colors of basic products that set our heads spinning when we shop . According to Bill Hyde , the manager of Balducci ' s in Greenwich Village , this proliferation is due to more " sophisticated tastes. " // " Americans , " he said , " have discovered what Europeans have known about for a long time . " But like so many things , Americans believe if a little is good , more is better . Or , as Ted Kronyn of Universal Foods Company , an importing firm , said , " It doesn ' t take much for Americans to pick up on something and then you get a tremendous ride very ordinary. " // The interest in new foods has led to a cornucopia of olives , olive oil and cheeses from every country that produces them , and a dozen different dried mushrooms . Each has something distinctive to offer . It has also led to an incalculable assortment of flavored mustards , vinegars , oils , teas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English muffins . Some of the variations are so far removed from the basic product that it is difficult to categorize them if they aren ' t placed with the foods they are supposed to resemble. // A " tea , " for example , made from apples , dates , lemons , apricots and peaches and sweetened with glucose . Or mustard made with tomatoes , currants , beet root , fennel - and mustard . A wine vinegar flavored with cloves , thyme , rosemary , fennel , laurel , basil and marjoram . All you need to make a salad dressing is a little olive oil . " For me it ' s definitely ridiculous , " said Michel Fitoussi , chefowner of the Palace Restaurant . " If you want a tarragon flavor in your salad , big deal , you don ' t need tarragon vinegar . You put a few pieces of tarragon on the salad . It tastes fresher , too . " Julia Child also prefers to do it herself . " I don ' t like other people ' s seasonings , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compared to the other combinations that have proliferated in the last four years : raspberry white wine vinegar made with raspberry juice and honey ; blueberry vinegar made with white wine , blueberries , honey and cinnamon stick ; strawberry , black currant and cherry vinegar ; parsley and peppercorn red wine vinegar ; vinegar with lemon juice ; red wine vinegar made with anisette , garlic , onion , cloves , peppercorns and anise stars ; vinegar made from cabernet sauvignon . Even the Oriental rice vinegar has joined the variety show . It now comes " gourmet seasoned , " which means it contains sugar and sea salt and sells for 10 cents a bottle more than the plain rice vinegar . But the biggest-selling specialty vinegar at the moment is the Italian balsamic : its sweetness appeals to the American palate. // Mr. Fitoussi uses only Dessaux Fils red wine vinegar and if he doesn ' t want color , he uses white . He recommends sherry vinegar if you want to branch out. // The restaurateur and cooking teacher John Clancy confessed a fondness for raspberry . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " When I sauteed calf ' s liver I used to use red wine vinegar and a pinch of sugar ; now I use raspberry vinegar. " // But Mrs. Child has only one vinegar : Dessaux red . And she has only one mustard , Dijon , though she said the Pommery and Creole-style , " the ones with the seeds , are quite fun. " // Mr. Fitoussi said , " If you want the flavor of thyme or anything else in your mustard , you simply add the flavoring to the dish for considerably less money. " // Don ' t tell that to Maille or Paul Corcellet , French manufacturers of dozens of flavored mustards , not all of which are doing well . Corcellet ' s peanut mustard , black olive mustard and Xeres vinegar mustard had been marked down from $3 or $4 to 99 cents a jar at Bloomingdale ' s last week. // Every combination of herbs used in vinegars has made its way into mustards , along with several others : mustards with anchovies , hickory smoke flavor , green peppercorn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ingredients are sugar and water . Mustard with chili pepper is a French export creation . It is doubtful if the French ever saw a chili pepper before they began producing it for export . If they had they would know that " chili pepper " is a redundancy . Salt-free Arizona Champagne mustard sauce is labeled " all natural " to distinguish it from some mustards that are preserved , emulsified and thickened with sulphur dioxide , potassium metabisulfites , xanthan gum , calcium disodium , EDTA ( a preservative ) , or citric acid and sodium benzoate. // The newest rage in mustards is the combinations of honey and mustard , plus other ingredients such as corn oil . But Mr. Kronyn believes there will be only eight or nine varieties of mustard in a few years . " Peanut mustard , et cetera , " he said , " these will not exist. " // Oils are as varied as the vinegars and mustards . In addition to the nut and seed varieties from which they are pressed , oils come in flavors . Olive oil has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaves , rosemary and savory pimento from Provence . Walnut oil has been blended with rapeseed oil . Oils are being produced especially for fondue , fish and pizza. // Both Mr. Fitoussi and Mr. Hyde use three kinds of oil : extra virgin olive oil for salad , blended vegetable oil and walnut . Mrs. Child , who can ' t see why people want to " load up on stuff like that , " uses virgin olive oil for salads and a regular olive oil for all her cooking. // Henry Kaplan of De Choix Specialty Foods , an importing company in Queens , said the prices retailers are charging for olive oils are ridiculous . " I sell a liter of colavita for $4. 10 and some stores mark it up to $11 , " he said . " It ' s unconscionable to have that kind of markup on something that is just an ordinary thing in Italy or France. " // Peppercorns come in for criticism from several of the cooks . Mr. Fitoussi uses white for light colored sauces , black for everything else . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but Mrs. Child doesn ' t think that they " give any special taste to anything unless you mash them up and then who knows they are there ? " No one has a kind word to say about pink berries , sometimes mistakenly called peppercorns. // The experts , however , generally approve of the increased variety of cheeses . The interest in goat cheese continues unabated , and layered Italian cheeses such as the delicious mascarpone gorgonzola are beginning to hit their stride . Each contains the velvety rich mascarpone , best described as a triple cream twice over . Some of the layered combinations work , some don ' t . All are expensive , $10 to $20 a pound . The torta basilico , layers of pine nuts , basil , mascarpone and a mixture of Parmesan and pecorino Romano , is redolent of basil and is a delightful combination of the crunch and sweetness of the pine nuts and the sharpness of the Parmesan mixture . The figs , bitter almonds and mascarpone don ' t work , nor does the salmon and mascarpone. // Nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teas on the shelves . There are honeys from almost every country , flavored by almost every variety of tree , bush and flower . And just when it seems there is no other variety of tea to market , someone finds one : tea flavored with " natural bourbon vanilla , " bing cherries and butterscotch ; herb teas made in cubes , much like bouillon ; decaffeinated teas ; sangria tea flavored with dried berries , natural orange and lemon flavor . Is it served in a tea cup or a wine glass ? // Not to be outdone , coffee beans are being mixed with flavorings : amaretto , dried orange peel , cinnamon sticks ; toasted almonds and chocolate. // Where once only water bagels reigned , there are now soft plump bagels that come in at least nine varieties , one of which is plain , but not hard. // Both English muffins and pitas are available in five flavors . Pasta comes in the colors of the Italian flag - white , red and green - plus whole wheat and yellow , fresh , dried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seller often becomes next year ' s sale item . Bill Hyde thinks the proliferation has peaked and that people will be returning to basics. // " Hopefully , the next development , " Mr. Hyde said , " will be in the American market . Why can ' t we make fantastic jams , honeys and cheeses ? " It is a sentiment shared by John Clancy. // " Instead of worrying about all these fancy things they are shipping over , this country should worry about making some good basic things , " he said . " All the basic ingredients are going down hill here and all those so-called gourmet things are increasing. " //
