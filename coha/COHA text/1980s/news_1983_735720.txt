txt The Air Force said it plans to deduct $1.4 million from payments to United Technologies Corp . to recover an overcharge it says it found in a 1977 contract for F-100 jet engines . A spokesman for the Air Force said Pentagon auditors " determined that the contract was overpriced by about $1.4 million because of faulty information provided by the contractor at the time of negotiation . " The contract was for 65 of the jet fighter engines made by the company 's Pratt &; Whitney group . Last week , Pratt said it , too , had found pricing " errors " in the same contract and was voluntarily proposing a refund to the Air Force of under $1 million . But the Air Force statement yesterday stressed that the planned deduction of $1.4 million from payments to Pratt &; Whitney would be " separate and apart from " the proposed refund . The Air Force said it still has n't formally received the company 's refund offer , and wo n't decide what to do about it until the service can " review the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United Technologies was the third largest recipient of Pentagon contracts last year , with awards totaling $4.2 billion . Pratt &; Whitney 's F100 engine powers the top two U.S. fighters , both used by the Air Force ? Douglas Corp . ' s F-15 and General Dynamics Corp . ' s F-16 . The Air Force overpricing statement was the second blast by the Pentagon at the company in as many days . On Monday , in a draft report by the Defense Department 's Inspector general , Pratt was accused of charging unfair and unreasonable prices for spare engine parts . In Hartford , Conn. , a spokesman for Pratt &; Whitney said " this is a pricing matter which the Air Force issued a decision on a year ago . We brought it to the Armed Services Board of Appeals but it is still in litigation . " The spokesman also said that Pratt voluntarily offered to " reduce future charges to the Air Force for spare engine parts , " but that this " was a separate matter . " The spokesman refused to comment on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At a breakfast session with reporters yesterday , before the Air Force statement , Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Thayer said " it appears there has been some negligence on somebody 's part " regarding spare parts . He said " corrective action should be fast . " He refused to specify what form such actions might take , but said he would be willing to take " severe " and " punitive " steps if they are justified . Mr. Thayer , former chairman of LTV Corp. , noted that the Air Force already has withdrawn government approval for Pratt &; Whitney 's spare parts purchasing system . He also disclosed that the Pentagon is withholding $25 million from the company in a previous pncing dispute . But he said it would be up to Pratt &; Whitney to dismiss people or take other steps to correct the problem . He added : " You ca n't shut Pratt &; Whitney down , can you ? "
