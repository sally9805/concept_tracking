THE MEETING AT TELGTE by Gnter Grass <P> Translated by Ralph Manheim ; Harcourt Brace Jovanovich ; 147 pages ; $9.95 <P> Historical novelists commonly cast imaginary characters in real events . Author Gnter Grass , 53 , turns this standard formula on its head . The Meeting at Telgte teems with more than 20 German writers and literary figures , all of whom actually lived and worked during the 17th century . What these people did not do , how ever , is precisely the subject of Grass 's novel . They did not meet together in 1647 , near the end of the Thirty Years ' War , nor did they sit down to discuss ways of uniting their ravaged father land through the power and the glory of the German language . <P> In conceiving and describing a happening that never happened , Grass is playing a sophisticated version of the what-if game . His point is not to guess how German history might have been changed if , at a crucial moment , the poets had rallied round the native tongue . Instead , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1947 a loose confederation of German writers and publishers did as unlike their predecessors 300 earlier . As citizens , they looked on a divided , devastated nation ; artists , they found their language by the murderous rhetoric the Nazis . They argued and dis literature and the writer 's ability to heal his countrymen . They read manuscripts to each other and decided to convene annually , which they did for the next 20 years . They came to be known as Group 47 ; Grass joined them in the middle ' 50s and became the most talented and distinguished alumnus of them all . <P> It helps to know this while reading The Meeting at Telgte , for the novel is in part Grass 's allegorical tribute to Group 47 . But the book is also an imaginative leap , and easily accessible as such even to those unfamiliar with the details of German life in this or the 17th century . Grass whisks himself off to one of the many times in history when the sword seemed mightier than the pen . He watches poets ' gather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ risks to get there . Brigands and bands of hungry soldiers terrorize travelers ; the local river yields up dead bodies . Ignorant armies have been clashing night and day for nearly 30 years . Food is scarce ; there is " nothing left to cackle " in the village . <P> The poets ' purpose amid all this car nage and chaos is noble : " Giving new force to the last remaining bond be tween all Germans , namely , the German language they held in common . " Their behavior quickly proves unworthy of their unifying ideal . They begin by squabbling over the proper use of dactylic words . They fall into grim dispute " over the essence of irony and of humor . " Thunderous abuse follows the reading of each manuscript . Worst of all , these noble spirits find themselves implicated in the cruelty of their age ; the feast mysteriously provided them by Gelnhausen , a dashing young member of their entourage , turns out to have been tainted by violence and plunder.           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
