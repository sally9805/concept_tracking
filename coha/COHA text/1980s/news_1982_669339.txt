// * Safety : There should be plenty of electrical outlets , preferably the three-prong grounded outlets . If the room has few outlets , use a commercially made outlet strip at the operating table rather than a nest of extension cord , to bring electricity to your equipment . Parts or circuits carrying any form of electrical current , whether DC , AC , or radio frequency , should be covered to prevent shocks . The voltage and current levels in many pieces of radio equipment are dangerous. // All equipment , from the code key to the transmitter , should be connected to a good ground as a precaution against shocks : Ideally , the equipment should be connected to one or more six-foot ground rods driven into the earth . Use heavy gauge copper wire or strips of copper flashing to make the connections . Short of that , connection to a cold-water pipe will suffice. // Antennas should never be erected near utility power lines , nor should they be erected when a thunderstorm is nearby . To the extent possible , route the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reach of passersby . The line should have either a lightning arrester or a switch that will let you disconnect your radios and ground the antenna lead when a thunderstorm approaches. // // * Location in the home : Try to set up the station in a relatively secluded part of your home . This way , you won ' t disturb others , and they won ' t disturb you . One good location is in a basement or ground-floor room . These places afford easy access to an earth ' ' ground . ' ' Another alternative is an attic : It ' s closer to the antenna , so the transmission line can be kept short , but it ' s also farther from an acceptable grounding point. // // * The operating table : The chief concern here is operator comfort . Equipment should be placed on a shelf high enough so that the tuning dials or displays are at eye level . And there should be enough room to rest your entire forearm on the table when using the telegraph key . There should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and station logbooks , which you ' ll use to record your station activities . One possibility is to use an unfinished door supported at each end by filing cabinets ( used ones , if you ' re a good bargain hunter ) . // Once your Novice license has arrived and your equiment is hooked up , it ' s time for the moment of truth : your first contact. // ' ' My first contact ? It was kind of exciting and rather scary , confusing . I had trouble figuring out what they were saying and what I was supposed to say , ' ' says Stephen K. Sorton , KA0GFA . ' ' But once you make a few contacts , it gets exciting ! ' ' // Stephen , whose father has been an amateur radio operator for 27 years , earned his Novice license in 1979 at the age of 12 . He upgraded to General class last July. // ' ' My hands were shaking , I didn ' t know I could do it , ' ' says Tobi Fisher ( KA9MMY ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them I was new . They gave me a lot of encouragement. ' ' // That ' s a key point : Don ' t hesitate to tell other stations you ' re a newcomer . If the other station is sending code too fast , ask the operator to slow down . It ' s a more effective way to keep the contact going than if you tell the other station you missed the transmission because of static or interference . This forces the other operator to repeat information - probably at the same speed used before. // Mrs. Fisher adds that it ' s helpful to have an experienced ham with you the first time you go on the air . In her case , her husband Gary ( K9WZB ) coached her along. // ' ' Rag-chewing , ' ' holding long chats with other stations , is probably the first activity most hams try . But it doesn ' t take long for rag-chewing to give way to public service work , contesting , and DXing ( contacting foreign countries ) , just to name a few. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and excitement. // ' ' A contact with a friend in England , G3MFQ , was my first real DX station , ' ' says Mrs. Fisher . ' ' Then one day , just out of the blue , I talked to KP2A/K , a DXpedition to Navassa Island in the Caribbean ! They had just moved into the Novice bands , and I just happened to be there when they put out a call ! ' ' // One reason for her enthusiasm - even seasoned DXers ' went after the Navassa station with gusto - is that contacts with the island , a speck of land between Haiti and Jamaica , are rare . Only when ham radio operators travel to the island and set up a temporary station there ( a DXpedition ) can contacts with it be made. // Handling traffic - third-party messages from people all over the country - also is popular . Novice traffic networks often give new operators their first exposure to amateur radio public service work. // Sitting in front of radio gear tucked in a corner of a third-floor bedroom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the First Region Net , which handles traffic to and from the New England states. // As he zeroes in on the 7 : 45 p. m. net , the high-pitched staccato of Morse code fills the room . ' ' That ' s Milt , ' ' he says with a grin , on hearing the call sign of a station checking into the net . ' ' He ' s a retired banker down in Connecticut. ' ' // He explains that , in general , nets are organized into four tiers , each covering a broader swath of territory than the previous one . Nets meet according to a strict time sequence , repeated four times a day . At the highest level are the area nets , each covering about one-third of the coast-to-coast distance across the United States and Canada. // According to the latest listing from the American Radio Relay League ( ARRL ) , the national organization for amateur operators , there are 46 Novice nets around the country. // ' ' I ' ve done a little bit of traffic work , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good way to increase your code speed and meet new people. ' ' // One event high on almost every ham ' s calendar is Field Day , sponsored by the ARRL each June . It ' s a contest with a serious purpose . Individuals or clubs operate during a weekend , usually from an outdoor site , and try to contact as many other stations as possible . Bonus points are given for , among other things , operating from noncommercial power sources such as diesel generators or solar panels tied to storage batteries . The exercise is designed to test amateur radio operators ' ability to operate under emergency conditions . And there ' s plenty of room in the event for Novices. // While these are just a smattering of the many activities open to new hams , there ' s one that shouldn ' t be left out : preparing to upgrade to a higher license class . Once you get beyond the Novice license , you can use voice , radio teletype , satellites , and TV , in addition to code . Once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ll be exposed to a whole new world of communications . And you ' ll meet a wide range of new people on the air. // Says Mrs. Fisher , who upgraded to General less than two months after she got her Novice license last February , ' ' My first voice contact as a General was with a fellow in Oregon who has been written up in National Geographic . His farm has some dinosaur relics on it . He was really interesting to talk to ! ' ' // //
