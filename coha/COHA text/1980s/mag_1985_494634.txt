" 0 ruth , what crimes have been committed in thy name ! " wrote Preston Sturges . How well I know the fanatical look in the eve , the light foam on the lips , the orgastic tension of the face muscles , and the sadistic smile on the face of the one who says : " I am going to be ruthless . " It is such a beautitulh , positive thing to be , so decisive and virile , fraught with such a feeling of well-being , that it is almost irresistible . Sturges , a director who wrote his own scripts , made five wonderfully ruthless comedies and two pretty good ones between 1940 and 1943 . ( There was another good one , the morbid , unsettling Unfaithfully 1Vurs , in 1948 . ) Among the slow-paced , oppressively sane movies of the 1940s , his satires pulsate with gleeful , vindictive energy ; the characters are wound up too tight to keep their heads on when assaulted by unruly hormones , practical jokers , or ? most deadly of all ? friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time when Depression roughness and insouciance were shading into genteel momism and apple-piety , Sturges rubbed his hands together and proceeded to hang the hell out of such sacred topics as patriotism , pregnancy , and what were not then called male-female roles . ( Despite the rapacious image brought to mind by Sturges 's pan of ruth , despite his boast that his pictures were a good MIX of schmaltz , schmerz , and schmutz , his sexual dramas are positively Shavian exercises in female pursuit and male surrender . ) Overand marriage- hungry heroines , Sturges 's recessive heroes are also put upon by a crew of Dickensian grotesques , " supporting " characters who joyously undermine logic , language , morals , and common sense in their hysterical desire to express their personalities . Reassuring a candidate who is appalled that the voters are being told wild fabrications about his past , William Dernarest explains , " Those ai n't lies . Those is campaign promises . " Sympathy and contempt for the average man are intertwined in Sturges 's generous , teasing farces . The clerk in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they ca n't get married on what he earns : Everything that means happiness costs money . . . ( Mom ' never had a pretty dress except what she made herself . I wore the old man 's stuff cut down till I got my first lob and he was worn out at 48 and croaked because he could n't afford a decent doctor . Where do you get that eighteen bucks a week stuff ? The Santa Claus plot showers the clerk ? after much confusion , adversity , and throwing of fish ? with a good job and a contest prize of $25,000 . As his girlfriend says , begging the boss to give him a promotion : le belongs in here because he thinks he belongs in here . . he belongs in here until he proves himselt or tails and then somebody else after him and then somebody else after that , and then so on and so on for always ... because it 's one thing tomutt a chance when you get it , but it 's another thing never to have had a chance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hail the Conquering Hero , Sturges invites our Rabelaisian , almost sadistic laughter at the terrified victim of his plot and the society that thinks he deserves respect and honor . In the first film Eddie Bracken becomes a hero of potency because his wife has produced sextuplets ? by another man . In the second , playing another guilt-ridden 4-F , he is drafted for mayor when the townspeople believe he has won his borrowed medals , and elected ( for proving his virtue ) when he confesses to the fraud while protecting the buddies who got him into it . Pompous , genial Raymond Milburn sighs at the mindlessness of his fellow citizens ( " The poor , misguided voters , without a brain to bless themselves with , without a cerebellum to the carload " ) and asks what a talent for killing people has to do with being able to govern a town . But Sturges loves to have things three ways at once : Walburn 's reasonable comments are undercut by the fact that he is playing the incumbent mayor . At the climax , Sturges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a rush of mad energy and raw sentiment . The wild reversals of fortune leave us feeling Olympian but benevolent : the gods take away , but the gods also give . ( The ending of The Miracle of Morgan 's Creek is similarly frantic , but the note of sardonic , godlike detachment is struck a hit harder with the quotation Sturges uses for a tag line . The congratulations to Bracken 's wayward but productive wife end with " Some are born great , some achieve greatness " ? you can finish it yourself . ) IN Sullivan 's Travels , Sturges 's most personal film , a director of lowbrow comedies , disgusted by his previous successes , hits the road disguised as a bum so he will have the expertise to make a great social-protest movie , Brother , Where ilrf Thou ? Sullivan is determined to plow ahead with this film , whether the downtrodden public wants it or not . When the studio bosses try to discourage him , pointing out that another picture about the class struggle died a terrible death in Pittsburgh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pittsburgh ? " " They know what they like , - the producer says , which provokes the defender of the proletariat to the ultimate class-versus-mass statement : they knew what they liked , they would n't live in Pittsburgh . " But Sullivan 's cockiness and his pretensions are knocked out of him when he loses his tourist status in the lower depths : railroaded on an assault charge and unable to prove his identity , he is sentenced to a chain gang . At last , through a trick , he lets the studio know where he is , and they spring him in about 20 seconds . He then announces that , having seen that laughter is the only thing some people have , he will go on making slapstick comedies to take their minds off their troubles . THIS ending is a slower-paced , more 1 restrained one than the closes of Miracle and Hero , and some unpleasant questions hover over it . For instance , what about the other convicts in the gang , who are beaten and tortured in the daytime and chained to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be innocent too ? Yet Sullivan , with his expensive lawyers , is the only one to go free . This echoes a scene earlier in the movie , when Sullivan , in his hobo clothes , is pinched for stealing his own car . The cop discovers who he is , but points out that he was driving without a license . Sullivan sarcastically replies , " Yes , is n't that terrible . That must call for a dollar fine and ten minutes in jail . " We are clearly supposed to feel , at the end of the picture , that Sullivan has been humbled and will give the public what it wants , not what he thinks it should have . Yet Sullivan 's original purpose in shoving uplift at the masses was not to improve them but to salve his own conscience for turning out moronic movies . ( Not knowing his identity , a girl he picks up enthusiastically praises one of his pictures : " Do you remember that scene where . . . she made him close his eyes and count three before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pig instead ? " " Yes , " he replies dismally , " that was on a very high plane . " ) Now that he has a sociological justification for it , he can continue to produce trash and spread sunshine all the way to the bank . As if in tribute to the pictures that are supposed to entertain the masses , Sullivan 's Travels includes some passages of slapstick humor ? Sullivan falls into a rain barrel , and he takes part in a car chase that leaves people splattered with mud and pancake batter . But , as in most other Sturges movies , this violent physical comedy seems to slow everything down . The Rube Goldberg setups are clever enough , but their execution is ponderous ; it 's as if the brilliant cynic has suddenly decided to be a regular guy . The rough-and-tumble stuff works best when it 's simple , and has something to do with the character : Henry Fonda , as the primordial klutz in The Lady Eve , manages to tall down three times at a dinner party when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pretending to be an English aristocrat . Back in his room , the surly valet , neatly pointing up the metaphor , insists , " That 's the same dame . She looks the same , she walks the same , and she 's tossing you just like she did the last time . " Sturges rather falls for his female characters too , portraying their manipulative techniques with a surgical lack of sentimentality but sympathizing with the need for them . The woman seeking a mate ? the entrepreneur whose visible assets are depreciating daily ? is for Sturges the purest form of buccaneer . Stanwyck airily calls herself an adventuress , but adds , " All women are . They have to he . 11 you waited for a man to propose to you from natural causes you 'd die of old maidenhood . " When Fonda throws her over , Sturges 's sympathy for the Stanwyck character is exquisite : he allows her to express not only sorrow but revenge , and to do so in a way that emphasizes her full-blooded femininity . Perhaps the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the camera in a tight close-up and vowing to teach the man who hurt her a lesson : " I need that guy like the ax needs the turkey . " Nye Screenplays collects the scripts Sturges wrote for Hail the Conquering Hero , Sullivint 's Travels , The Lady Eve , Christmas in Tidy , and his first film , a gutsy farce about political corruption called The Great McGinty . The last two have Sturges touches , but not his rough , passionate embrace . ( A complete anthology of Sturges 's best scripts would include The Miracle of Morgan 's Creek and his dizzy , romantic farce about the useless rich , The Palm Beach Story ; Brian Henderson explains that the publication rights to those were not available . ) Reading the scripts through , one is impressed not only by their cleverness and high spirits , but by the amount of innuendo Sturges was able to slip past the Hays Office . ( These were the days , Henderson reminds us , when a director had to battle the censors for the right to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In The Great McGinty a political boss exhorts his candidate to get married : " Do n't you know that a man without a wife is like a coat without the pants , like a pig without a poke ? " When Henry Fonda , in The Lady LT , invites Barbara Stanwvck in to see his pet snake , she 's incensed to find that he really does have a pet snake . Henderson says that , for lack of space , he has not indicated any differences between the scripts and the films . ( Stanwvck 's line about the ax and the turkey , for instance , appears here as " I need him like Dempsey needed Firpo . " ) He has , however , found space for long and idiotic introductions of his own to each screenplay , vast desert tracts in which the winds whistle past the bleached hones of deconstructionism : It is worth noting also that 51411inin 's Travels ends in an airplane in mid-air , which is where Untattlitully Yours ( 194f4 ) , Sturges 's next " ironic portrait of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , forewords , prefaces , epigraphs , and headnotes are ambiguously situated both inside the text and outside it . l hompson -- the honest man referred to in the Bead note lot Ihe Great McGintid ? himself uses an expression in the headnotel to describe his life-changing thievery . Is he quoting the head-note , as if he has privileged access to the narration itself ? Or does the headnote quote him , which seems to privilege his perspective , including his skepticism about McGinty 's story later on ? Modern criticism sure provokes a lot of questions . Examining a story that was the genesis of The Lady Eye , I lenderson writes : This is the last sentence to I lotte 's otherwise perfectly typed story . Is it a typographical error or a mistake in the writing itself ? . It is tempting to see the error as emblematic of the story 's sexism and as symptomatic ot the psychic niechanisms that underlie sexism in society generally . And you can be sure that lienderson voluptuously gives in to the temptation , for 400 words . Of course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secretary did n't type his story for him ? which would mean that his psychic mechanisms were O.K. , but hers were badly in need of an overhaul . Amid all this academic waffle , lienJerson does make one sensible observation ( though , unfortunately , it applies to only one of the scripts in this book ) ? that several of Sturges 's works were concerned with the recapture or punishment of the wife or lover who has abandoned the hero . ( Besides The Lady L'e , Unfaithfully Yours and The Palm Beach Story have this theme . ) Drawing on lames Curtis 's 1982 biography , Between Hops , Henderson points out that Sturges 's mother and a few of his wives were glamorous , elusive , and fickle . He does not , however , note a few especially poignant similarities . When Sturges 's wealthy wife Eleanor ' Haim asked him how much he wanted to give her a divorce ( she owed him about $100,000 ) , he said , " It will cost you one courteous request , madame , and a polite thank-you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Laih EVC , who has fallen in love with the millionaire she tricked into marriage , says she wo n't charge him a cent for the divorce he wants ; he only has to come and ask her in person . EN/en more striking , Sturges wrote that when he was still in love with Eleanor , he had said to her one night , " A thousand poets dreamed for a thousand years ? and then you were born . " He obviously thought it was a good line -- it 's the last thing Rex Harrison says in Ilnfaithlully Yours , breathing passionately over the wife who has come back to him . Well , what is art for , except to make things come out the way they should . Sturges 's I iollywood success was meteoric ( the Iirst picture he directed made most ten-best lists of 1941 ) and won an Academy Award for best screenplay ) , his failure equally so . Bad movies and bad business deals had by 1951 gotten him to the point where , Curtis writes , " less than live years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Preston did n't have the money to pay a S6.00 gas bill . " When he net the woman who became his last wife , she had never heard of him , and he showed her a Who 's Who entry , saying ( shades of Sulltourt 's Trio ? /s ) , " 1 do n't want you to think I 'm a total bum . " But if his life sadly demonstrated the capriciousness of fortune , his films very gaily did so , with abundant affection for the victims of success .
