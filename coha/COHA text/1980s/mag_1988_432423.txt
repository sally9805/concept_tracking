 | Start with a hardscrabble rural county that 's roughly one third white , one third black and one third Indian ? but where whites have long ruled , often with iron determination . Add destitution so bad that 36 percent of blacks fall below the poverty line , and violence so endemic that Indians are murdered at twice the rate of others . On top of that , mix in a deadly cocaine traffic . Together , what you get is turmoil ? and plenty of it . What you get is Robeson County , N.C. , a place , says a prominent state newspaper editor , that is a " throwback to an earlier day . " Adds Ray Littleturtle , an Indian spokesman : " This is a sophisticated Selma , Ala. , plus drugs . " Lately , trouble seems to have come in bunches for Robeson County . On March 26 , judicial candidate Julian Pierce , a popular Lumbee Indian lawyer seen by many as the best hope for a generation of underrepresented minorities , was killed by an assailant firing three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ automatically assumed it had been a political assassination . But intense police work led to the arrest of two Indians , one of whom promptly committed suicide , and the case was wrapped up as simply the tragic result of a domestic dispute . The Pierce murder came just as the county was getting over the trauma of February 1 . That 's when Eddie Hatcher and Timothy Jacobs , two Indians armed with sawed-off shotguns , stormed the office of the local newspaper , the Robesonian , and terrorized 17 hostages while demanding to voice their claim to have uncovered a drug ring that included prominent citizens . The two surrendered after 10 hours when Governor James Martin promised to set up a special commission to hear their evidence . Jacobs and Hatcher later refused to talk . Nevertheless , many locals still consider the two men , who face life in prison for hostage taking , to be heroes . The editor of the Robesonian even wrote an editorial lauding them as " our conscience . " Right now , Robeson County ? 949 square miles of scrub pine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the state ? is in the midst of a May 3 election race that could have been the most important in its history . It 's the race for the Superior Court judgeship , a position created by the North Carolina Legislature last year specifically to give the minorities of Robeson County some significant representation in the criminal-justice system . But after the minority candidate , Pierce , was killed , the judgeship in effect was guaranteed to the only other candidate , Joe Freeman Britt . Britt , it turns out , symbolizes everything that blacks and Indians claim is wrong with their county . As the state district attorney , the cigar-chomping , 6-foot-6-inch lawyer has put some 35 men and women on death row . He has earned himself recognition as the world 's " deadliest prosecutor " in the Guinness Book of World Records . " In all jurors , a small flame burns . . . a flame wanting to  | preserve human life , " he says . " It 's my job to extinguish that flame . " The D.A . ' s zeal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even won him the grudging respect of enemies like attorney Robert Mahler , a leading state foe of the death penalty . But Mahler says Britt " sees his duty as obtaining convictions at any cost " and that this results in unequal justice . Among the complaints : That Britt manipulates the system to coerce guilty pleas ? by clogging calendars to make defendants spend needless days in court or by insisting on exorbitant bond . In recent years , four reports , including one last fall from the North Carolina Commission on Indian Affairs , have concluded that Robeson County 's justice system discriminates against minorities . Complicating all of this are drugs ? astonishingly plentiful for a rural area . Assistant U.S. Attorney William Webb says federal drug agents have bought 92 percent pure cocaine for $1,100 an ounce ? as good a deal as any to be found in Miami . Agents once seized the drug still wrapped in fabric with a blue seal marked " Republica de Colombia , " and on another occasion closed down a house trailer converted into a cocaine store with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's partly because I-95 , the main thoroughfare between Miami and New York , cuts right through Robeson . And Robeson 's otherwise isolation is convenient for hiding small airstrips . In a community where only 35 percent of Indians have even a high-school diploma , observes highschool Principal Ray Oxendine , some find drug dealing the quickest way to turn a buck just as some of their parents and grandparents ran bootleg whisky . Robeson County Sheriff Hubert Stone says his department has made great strides against drugs in the last two years . Since he expanded his force from one narcotics agent to four , he has been making 400 drug arrests a year . Character witness . Yet Stone 's critics say he has , at times , been too cozy with drug dealers . The sheriff surprised many when he testified as a character witness at the 1985 trial of Carson Maynor , a local man arrested by Stone 's deputies for selling cocaine . Stone also wrote a letter seeking the release of Jonathan Lowry , a Robeson County man arrested in Florida for buying 500 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Stone says he did nothing unusual and , facing subpoenas , simply testified that the reputations of the two men ? who had not previously been arrested for drug dealing ? had been good in the community . Stone has also been criticized by Indians and blacks for his department 's handling of several killings , particularly that of Jimmy Earl Cummings in 1986 . Cummings , a small-time drug dealer , was shot after being stopped for a traffic violation by the sheriff 's deputy ? and son ? Kevin Stone . A hastily convened coroner 's inquest ruled that the deputy fired his pistol " by accident and/or self-defense " after Cummings began swinging a plastic bucket of marijuana at him . The Cummings case began a new wave of minority activism . According to the Rev. Joy Johnson , a black civil-rights leader , it focused minority attention on 18 murders that remain on the " unsolved " list . Douglas McMillan , a black member of the city council of Lumberton , the county 's major city , says that activism has led to " an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they can accomplish change by forming a coalition at the ballot box . In March 's Super Tuesday voting , for example , Jesse Jackson , who campaigned in Robeson , carried the county . School reform . Another Super Tuesday vote was even more significant : A decision , by a narrow margin , to consolidate the county 's five separate school systems . Under the current system , says Eric Prevatte , a white businessman and the leader of a five-year campaign for consolidation , the blacks and Indians are condemned to inferior education in racially imbalanced schools . The most important impact of the change , Prevatte says , will be to " end the separation of our peoples that has been the cause of our worst problems . " To many , the school vote ? upheld after a recount on April 12 ? was a sign that Robeson County can mend race relations . To further the healing process , Governor Martin has agreed to ask the State Legislature to add one more county Superior Court judgeship ? to which he would appoint a minority member @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turmoil . David Weinstein , mayor of Lumberton , says it is time to build on the racial progress that does exist ? such as a newly agreed to county human-rights commission and a triracial city council . ( Lumberton was the city that director David Lynch used ? to the anguish of city boosters ? as a model and production site for " Blue Velvet , " his dark portrait of small-town America . ) Weinstein says it is important to resolve differences so that the community can spur economic development . One prospective company , an aluminum-window manufacturer , canceled a newly signed factory lease shortly after the takeover incident at the newspaper . But County Commissioner Jack Morgan sees a positive side to the recent unrest ? especially in the fact that the county 's ethnic factions are finally trying to work together . " It 's not the beginning of worse turmoil , " says Morgan , a Lumbee . " It 's a step to improved government , to better relations among people and certainly to a better Robeson County .
