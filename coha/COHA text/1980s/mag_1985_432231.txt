 | Cancer of the colon and rectum will strike as many as 138,000 Americans this year , and 60,000 will die from it . But unlike other major malignancies like cancer of the lung , colon cancer is 95 percent curable if detected in time . And thanks to better methods of detecting polyps like President Reagan 's and removing them before they turn into dangerous tumors , colon cancer can now actually be prevented . " We are at a very exciting point in medical research , " says Dr. Sidney Winawer of New York 's Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center . Bowel cancer is most likely to occur after the age of 50 , and the incidence peaks at 75 . In almost all cases , doctors now agree , the cancers start as polyps . Adenomatous polyps , grapelike growths with a relatively smooth surface , are the most common ; they tend to be small and are unlikely to develop into cancer . The ones most apt to be malignant are the so-called villous adenomas , like the large one removed from President Reagan . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than two centimeters in size . Statistically , a family history of bowel cancer or polyps increases a person 's risk two to three times . But in more than 90 percent of cases there is no identifiable family connection , notes Dr. Charles G. Moertel , chairman of the department of oncology at the Mayo Clinic . Does diet make a difference ? In recent years some epidemiologists have begun to find evidence that a diet high in fat and low in fiber may increase the risks . Countries like the United States and Great Britain , where the consumption of meat and fats is high , have far higher colon-cancer rates than Japan and parts of Africa , for example , where the diet is high in fiber and low in fat . Population studies have shown that Japanese migrating to Hawaii and the United States begin to develop a higher incidence of bowel cancer , possibly reflecting a change to a more Western eating pattern . One theory is that fat interacts with the bacteria and bile salts in the intestine to produce cancer-causing substances . Dukes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curable ? if it 's caught early . Prognosis is based on a staging system devised in the 1930s by a London pathologist , Cuthbert Dukes . Dukes Stage A describes a tumor that has invaded only the first layers of the bowel lining . Patients undergoing surgery at this stage enjoy a 95 to 99 percent chance of being healthy five years later . In Stage B the cancer has progressed into the deeper layer of muscle or the outer lining of the bowel , reducing  | the five-year survival rate to 75 to 85 percent . Stage C refers to tumor cells that have spread to nearby lymph nodes ; survivability depends on the number of nodes involved : a 60 to 70 percent cure rate with three or fewer cancerous nodes , but only 15 to 20 percent when 10 or more are involved . If the cancer has metastasized to the liver or other organs ? Stage D ? the mortality rate is 95 percent or more . Screening men and women for early detection before symptoms appear includes a test to detect traces of blood in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kit or have the procedure during his regular physical . A stool smear is taken , treated with a chemical and examined for color change . A positive result suggests internal bleeding . According to a study directed by Memorial Sloan-Kettering 's Winawer , a positive test in a person of 40 means a 20 percent chance of a polyp , and for a 50-yearold a 50 percent chance . Despite the fact that a number of authorities advise annual testing for middle-aged Americans , Moertel points out that it is not as accurate and sensitive as it should be . There are many false negatives and false positives , he says : " It will miss a substantial number of cases . The American public is paying for tests without getting any net benefit . " The American Cancer Society recommends that asymptomatic people have their doctors examine them by insertion of a lighted tube called a proctoscope or the longer , more flexible sigmoidoscope , both of which can detect tumors in the lower part of the descending colon . But many people find the exams both uncomfortable and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that even many physicians do n't undergo the exams ? including himself . Dull Pain : Moertel thinks the more practical approach to early detection is to pay close attention to the major symptoms and then see the doctor for a careful examination . One classic sign is a change in bowel habits , either an increased frequency of movements or constipation . A thinning in the diameter of the stool , caused by the obstruction , may also occur . Such changes may be caused by a number of factors , including diet , stress or intestinal viruses , but they should n't be ignored if they persist for two or three weeks . The first warning may be persistent abdominal discomfort , a dull pain or feeling of pressure . Visible traces of blood in the stool also warrant a visit to a physician , even though the cause may well be hemorrhoids or a slight abrasion of the anus . The diagnosis in patients with symptoms can be confirmed by X-ray studies and the use of the colonoscope . In the first the patient is given an enema @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fluoroscope and reveals polyps and tumors anywhere in the intestine . Likewise , the colonoscope , a six-foot-long fiber-optic device , can also reach all the way to the beginning of the colon and spot tumors with great accuracy . A snare at the end of the device can remove some kinds of polyps . Both of the tests must be performed by specialists and are too complicated and/or expensive to be used for mass screening . Surgical removal is the fundamental treatment for colon cancer . Patients with rectal cancer may also get radiotherapy to prevent recurrences , which are far more common in such cases than in cancer of the colon . Contrary to most people 's fear and apprehension , less than 10 percent of patients are forced to use a colostomy bag for the rest of their lives . Permanent colostomies , in which the remaining bowel is attached to an opening in the abdomen , were once common in cancer of the rectum and descending colon . Improved surgical techniques now permit easier reconnection of the ends of the bowel after removal of such tumors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they used to . The number of colostomies has also dropped because more cancers seem to be occurring ? or are being detected ? in the higher parts of the colon where reconnection is usually feasible . Drugs have proved largely ineffective in the treatment of bowel cancer . But researchers think that may change . In one of many experimental techniques under development around the country , investigators at Roswell Park Memorial Institute in Buffalo , N.Y. , are combining the standard cancer drug 5-FU with a substance called leucovorin that seems to " bind " the drug to cells in the colon and enhance its potency . At the National Cancer Institute , researchers are working on ways to hype up a patient 's immune system to more effectively attack tumor cells . " There are some hopeful experimental programs , " notes Moertel , " and there 's a very good chance they will bubble up into something helpful in the next 13% few years . " Barring such a breakthrough , however , frequent medical exams appear to be the most effective way of fighting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
