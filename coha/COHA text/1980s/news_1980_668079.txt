New regulations for psychiatrists , in which a secret code would be used to report drug-dependent patients under treatment with controlled substances to the state Department of Mental Health , won ' t prevent the misuse of drugs in treatment and might keep addicts from seeking legitimate help , a spokesman for the 1100-member Massachusetts Psychiatric Society said Wednesday . " Some drug-dependent persons and some medical practitioners exist in a symbiotic relationship that will not be seriously hindered . The regulation may deter others from seeking treatment , " said Dr. Steven M. Mirin , a McLean Hospital psychiatrist . Mirin testified at a public hearing on proposals to implement an 8-year- old law requiring reporting by practitioners who dispense controlled drugs . The little-known law , passed in 1972 , was used in the prosecution of a Cambridge psychiatrist last January who prescribed pain- killers and tranquilizers in the treatment of David Kennedy , son of the late Sen. Robert Kennedy . Dr. Lee B. Macht , chief of psychiatry at Cambridge Hospital , was fined $1000 for his failure to report the prescriptions , although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and few psychiatrists knew of its existance . Kennedy ' s treatment was subsequently turned over to the Aquarian Effort , a California-based rehabilitation group that sent a full- time counselor , Donald Juhl , to live with the young man at the family home in Hyannis . On March 5 the Massachusetts mental health commissioner , Robert L. Okin , who said he had not previously known the law existed , proposed the new regulations . Under the proposed guidelines , a unique identifier code , using the first letter of the patient ' s first name plus the first and second letters of thesurname , along with the patient ' s birthdate and address , would be forwarded to the Mental Health Department . These regulations are designed to prevent the dispensing of controlled substances to the same person from multiple sources or in quantities deemed harmful by the commissioner of mental health , Mirin said . But to get around the law , he said , " individuals who seek multiple prescriptions for controlled substances from a variety of doctors , will , as in the past , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By the same token , those practitioners who allegedly prescribe controlled substances to drug-dependent persons strictly for profit rather than treatment will no doubt assign several identifying codes to the same individual so that it does not appear that any one person is getting an inordinate number of prescriptions , " he said . " Drug-dependent individuals will not be swayed by assurances that their confidentiality will be maintained or that law enforcement agencies will not have access to their files , " Mirin said . " Many are reluctant to seek treatment at either public or private institutions for fear of discovery , loss of personal and professional reputation , and , in some cases , loss of their license to practice law , medicine , dentistry or pharmacy . " The brief hearing , at which Mirin was the only person testifying , was conducted at Lindemann Mental Health Center by Myra Gordon , a Mental Health Department attorney . In three weeks , she said , the proposed regulations will have the force of law . Written testimony criticizing the proposals was received from a number of psychiatrists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Dr. Jon E. Gudeman and Dr. Lester Grinspoon , a nationally known authority on drug dependence . " Even if there were a reasonable definition of drug dependence , it ( the proposed regulations ) would put a physician in a very difficult position , " Grinspoon wrote . Grinspoon used as an example the case of a patient dependent on large doses of barbiturates . While the doctor would not maintain such a patient on adrug the patient was using to support a dependency , Grinspoon said , the physician would prescribe gradually reduced doses until the patient was free of the drug . " To precipitously deprive such a patient of this drug is to jeopardize his well-being , " Grinspoon said . " To treat such a patient properly , I would have to prescribe barbiturates for a short while . Yet I would be reluctant to report him in the manner described in Dr. Okin ' s memo for fear of violating his rights and confidentialit y. "                   @ @
