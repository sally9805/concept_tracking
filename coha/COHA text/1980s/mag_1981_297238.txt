The spectacular landing of the space shuttle Columbia at Edwards Air Force Base in California was made possible by a rare combination of teamwork and planning . Those were also essential components in TIME 'S coverage of the historic mission . Last week , as the shuttle glided to a pinpoint touchdown on the dusty runway at Rogers Dry Lake , Los Angeles Bureau Chief Benjamin Cate and Correspondent Joseph Kane were on hand to record the breathtaking moment . With accommodations in short supply , the self-described " odd couple " rented a 29-ft. recreational vehicle that they parked just 100 yards from NASA 's press center . Cate , who has covered ten Gemini and two Apollo space missions , was not surprised by the postponement of the shuttle liftoff . Says he : " NASA has hardly ever had an on-time launch of a new spacecraft . A glitch was sure to creep into the countdown-and it did . " <P> The earlier stages of the mission were covered by correspondents stationed at NASA command centers in Texas and Florida . Houston Bureau Chief Robert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the astronauts ' physical and emotional condition in space . He soon discovered that the only way to communicate with technicians was by taking a crash course in scientific shorthand . Says Wurmstedt : " The major impression made on any reporter covering a space shot for the first time is the apparent inability of scientists to explain anything in laymen 's terms . Even the letter F can be a mystery . At NASA it stands for Fahrenheit , failure , female , forward and front . " Washington Correspondent Jerry Hannifin was at the Kennedy Space Center to witness the shuttle 's pyrotechnic liftoff a week ago Sunday . Hannifin , who covered the Gemini space program during the 1960s , was reminded once again of the high drama that always attends rocket launchings . Says he : " We are heading into space with all the capabilities to make it a living and working environment . " <P> As events turned out , the Sunday launch presented TIME 'S staff with the most dramatic pictorial countdown the magazine has ever faced . Less than 24 hours after Columbia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picture of the launch , the fastest color coverage in the magazine 's history .
