THE NEW BOY A story by Andre Dubus A SATURDAY NIGHT in summer : his mother and two sisters had dates and he did not want to greet the boys and the man . so he sat by the swimming pool , with his back to the house , and gazed at the lake and the woods beyond it . The house was on the crest of a ridge and , past the pool , the lawn was a long slope down to the lake . The sun was low over the trees , and their shadows spread toward him on the water . When he heard the last car , most of the lake was dark and the sun was nearly gone beyond the trees . The cars would return in the same order : Stephanie by twelve , Julie by two now that she was eighteen , then his mother ; he would wake as each one turned into the driveway , and sleep after the front door closed and light footsteps had gone from kitchen to bathroom to bedroom . Stephanie was sixteen and stayed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his mother was quickest at the door and did not stop at the kitchen unless a man came in for a drink , then Walter slept and woke again when the car started in the driveway , and he listened to his mother climbing the stairs and going to her room . Now she called him , and he looked over his shoulder at her standing behind the screen door . " I 'm going now . " " Have a good time . " W HEN THE CAR was gone , he rose and walked around the pool , then downhill to the lake , darker now than the sky . The sun showed through the woods as burning leaves . Then it was gone , leaving him in the black and gray solitude that touched him , and gave him thepeaceful joy of sorrow that was his alone , that singled him out from all others . A sound intruded : above the frogs ' croaking and the flutter and soft plash of stirring geese , so familiar that they were , to him , audible silence , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He looked to his right , near the shore , where purple loosestrife stood , deflowered by night , like charcoal strokes three feet tall . Beyond their tops he saw a head and arms and the small white roil of water at the feet . The swimmer angled toward him . Above and behind him , he felt the presence of his house : that place where , nearly always , he could go when he did not want something to happen . He stared at the head and arms coming to him . They rose : slender chest and waist of a boy walking through the dark water , then light bathing suit and leas and the boy stepped onto the bank and shook his head , sprinkling Walter 's face , then he pushed his hair back from his forehead . He was neither taller nor broader than Walter , who glanced at the boy 's biceps and did not see in them , either , the source of his fear . " It 's against the law to swim in there , " he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in it too . Let 's swim in your pool . " " How do you know I have one ? " " You live here ? " " Everybody on this road 's got one . I can see all the backyards from the sundeck . " " Do n't you have one ? " " It 's empty . " He started walking up the slope . " Which house ? " " Straight ahead . " Walter followed him up to the lighted house and stood at the shallow end while the boy 50 went to the deep end and dived in and swam back , then stood . " I have to go put on my suit . " " Turn on the underwater lights . " He turned them on with the switch near the door and went upstairs ; his room looked over the pool , and in the dark he stood at the window and undressed , watching the boy ? splashing silver as he moved fast through the water that was greener now in the light from the bottom of the pool . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , on its far side , the trees like a tufted black wall . He put on his damp trunks and went down the carpeted hall and stairs and out through the kitchen , then ran across flagstones to the side of the pool , glimpsing the boy to his left , in the deep end , and dived . opening his eyes to bubbles and the pale bottom coming up at him . He touched it with his fingers . Under the night sky the water felt heavy , deeper . He arced his back and started to rise ; the boy was up there , breaststroking , then bending into a dive , coming down at Walter , under his lifted arms : a shoulder struck his chest , an arm went around it , then the boy was behind him , the arm moved and was around his neck , tightening and pulling , and he went backward toward the bottom , and with both hands jerked at the wrist and forearm , cool and slick under his prying fingers . His jaws were clamped tight on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and bubbles rose toward the dark air . He rolled toward the bottom , touched it for balance with a hand , swung his feet down to it , and thrust upward with straightening legs ; he had exhaled again ; be released the boy 's arm and stroked upward and kicked and kept his mouth closed against the throbbing emptiness in his chest , then breathed water and rose to the air choking , inhaling , coughing . The boy 's arm had left his throat . He did not look behind him . Slowly he swam away , head out of the water , coughing ; he climbed out of the pool and , bent over , coughed and spat on the flagstones . He heard the feet behind him . " You 're crazy , " he said , then straightened and turned and looked at the boy 's eyes . He had seen them before , on school playgrounds : amused , playful , and with a shimmer of affection , they had looked at him as knowingly as his family and his closest friends did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they rarely fought at all . They threw your books in the mud , pushed you against walls , pulled your hair , punched your arm or stomach , shamed and goaded you . while watching boys and girls urged you to fight . Two years ago , when he was twelve , he had leaped into those voices , onto the bully , and they rolled grappling in the dust , then he was on his back , shoulders pinned by knees , fists striking his face before someone pulled the boy away . For the rest of the school year he was free ; and for the rest of his boyhood , for he knew that the months of peace were worth the fear and pain of the first quick fight , so he was ready for that , and so was left alone . This boy 's eyes were brown ; Walter swung his right fist at 51 them and struck the nose . The boy raised a hand to it , and looked at blood on the fingers . He wiped them on his trunks ; blood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know you were scared , " the boy said . " Scared my ass . " " I mean underwater . " " I could n't breathe . " The boy folded his arms . " I could , " " Let 's go inside and fix your nose . " " Let 's go inside and eat . " The boy turned and dived . Swimming underwater he pinched and rubbed his nose , and blood wafted from his fingers , became the green-tinted pale blue of the pool . He swam to the other side ; Walter walked around the pool and they went into the kitchen . The boy stood at the bar . Looking into the refrigerator , Walter said : " Peaches , grapes , liverwurst , cheese  --  four kinds of cheese ? " He turned and looked at the boy ; his eyes had not changed . I N THE STILL heat of Sunday morning he slept long and woke clammy to the voices of his sisters and mother rising from the terrace . Every day in summer his sisters slept Late , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mornings , going downstairs quiet and alone to eat cereal and read the baseball news , feeling in the kitchen silence their sleeping behind the three closed doors above him . They woke loudly , talking in the hall and from one bathroom door to another , and through bedroom doors as they altered their hair and faces ; their voices came down the stairs and into the kitchen , then they entered , red-lipped and tan and scented ; talking , they turned on the radio and made coffee and lit cigarettes . It seemed that always at least one of them was smoking , at least one was talking , and all three of them were now , on the terrace beneath his window ; he had not waked when they came home in the night , so his own night of sleep seemed long ; and , having no place to go , he still felt that he was late . He looked down at them sitting at the glass table ; their hair , chestnut in three seasons , was lighter ; they wore two-piece bathing suits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stephanie had a glass of wine . His mother let her drink wine at dinner and at Sunday brunch , and only Walter knew that when she drank at brunch she got drunk , for they stayed at the table longer than at any dinner except Thanksgiving and Christmas , and neither Julie nor his mother was soberenough to notice her rose cheeks and shining eyes . He put on his trunks and made his bed and moved past their rooms , glancing at their beds that would not be made until old Nora from Ireland came to work Monday afternoon , down the stairs into the undulant sound of their voices . He stepped into the sunlight and Stephanie said : " Well finally . " They smiled at him ; they wished him a good morning and he returned it ; Julie said why could n't she meet someone as good-looking as her brother ; his mother puckered her lips for a kiss and he gave her one . Their hair and bathing suits were dry . He stood above them in the warmth of the sun and their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his cheeks , and he left : went to the deep end and dived in and swam fast laps of the pool until he was winded , then returned to them . Someone had poured him a glass of orange juice . His mother blew smoke and said : " Spinach crepes , kid . Can you handle it ? " " Sure . " Stephanie looked down at herself and said : " I should n't handle anything . " " You 're not fat , " he said . " I need to lose seven pounds . " " Bull , " " She does , " his mother said . " But not today . " " Do it gradually , " Julie said . " Give yourself three weeks . " " That 's August . I 'd like to get into my bathing suit before August . " He looked through the glass table at her black pants like a wide belt around her hips . " You 're in it , " he said . " And look what shows , " and she pinched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really skinny to wear those things , " he said , then grinned , looking through glass at his mother 's and Julie 's flat skin above the maroon and blue swathes , and Julie said : " Okay , everybody stare at Walter 's pelvis . " He stood and , profiled to them , he drew in his stomach muscles , expanded his chest , flexed his left arm . and looked down at them over the rising and falling curve of his bicep as he rotated his wrist . " Our macho man , " Julie said , and his father was there : not a memory of the broad hairy chest , and hair curling over the gold watchband as he read the Sunday paper before swimming his laps , but his father in Philadelphia , in that apartment of leaves : plants growing downward from suspended pots and upward from pots on tables and floor , his father like a man reading in a jungle clearing ; he sat and drank juice and his mother said : " Were you up late last night ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Nothing . " He picked up a green cigarette pack , let it fall , pushed it toward Stephanie . He looked beyond Julie at Canada geese on the lake ; his mother and the girls were talking again , and he leaned back in the canvas deck chair and looked up at the blue sky , then closed his eyes and turned his face to the sun , and breathed deeply into the chill of his lie until it was gone , and his mother went to the kitchen , and he opened his eyes and watched the girls talking . They rarely said anything he wanted to know , but he liked hearing their voices and watching their faces and hands : they spoke of clothes , and he looked with tender amusement at their passionate eyes , their lips closing on cigarettes with sensuous pouts he knew they had practiced ; hair fell onto their cheeks , and their hands rose to it and lightly swept it back , as if stroking a spiderweb . From the house behind him , his mother came with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an ice bucket , a bowl of fruit , four plates with crepes , a glass of milk , and ringed napkins . He believed Julie  --  but maybe Stephanie  --  had asked one Sunday : What did you do with Dad 's napkin ring ? But since he could not remember the answer , he was not sure anyone had ever asked ; perhaps he had dreamed it ; or had imagined someone asking , and had waited for that ; he slipped linen from silver , and his mother asked him to pour the wine . For over a year of Sundays and dinners he had poured the wine , but always he waited for his mother to ask him : he disliked doing what his father had done , felt artificial and very young and disloyal too , as if he were helping to close the space his father had left behind ; and he disliked her never saying that she wanted him to pour because his father was gone . While his sisters nibbled and moaned and sipped , he ate fast , head down , waiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watching yet would not tell him the truth : that she wanted him to eat with slow appreciation of her work . She would tell him that eating fast was bad for him . Then he heard the squeak-skid of brakes and tires and turned to see him at the edge of the terrace , straddling his bicycle , barechested , wearinc , cut-off jeans and sneakers without socks . Walter nodded to him , ate the last of the crepe , and stood , looking at his mother as he swallowed and wiped his mouth . " I 'm going bike riding . " " Who 's that ? " " Mark Evans . " Walking away , he looked hack over his shoulder and said : " They moved in yesterday . " I N THE WOODS near the road he and Mark lay face down in the shadow of trees and looked through branches and brown needles of a larger fallen branch of pine ; Mark had dragged it from deeper in the woods , where their bicycles were chained to a tree . Moist dead leaves were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the white handkerchief hung : folded over a length of fishing line tied to trees on either side of the narrow road , it was suspended three feet above the blacktop , motionless in the still air . " It 's like waiting in ambush , " Walter said . " It 's better at night . It looks like a ghost at night . " " It looks like one now . " The first car that came around the curve down the road to their left was green and foreign ; Walter pressed his palms and bare toes against the earth and saw a second shape behind the windshield , a woman , and then two more figures in the back , and now the driver 's face : a man beyond the hood , wearing sunglasses , right hand at the top of the wheel , peering now , shifting down , slowing and slowing , the woman 's hands in front of her , pushing toward the windshield , then her head out of the window , saying " What is it ? " and the children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the man stopped and got out . He was tall and wore a suit , and Walter pressed against the leaves and watched him holding the line and looking down both of its ends ; then breaking it , and watching the handkerchief fall , and standing with fists on his hips , turning his head from one side of the road to the other as he spoke : " I want you boys to think about something while you 're in there laughing and having your fun . You could kill somebody . You could make somebody swerve into another car . I 've got two kids in mine . You could have caused something you 'd regret for the rest of your lives . " Then he went back to his car . Before he got in , his wife said : " Do n't just leave it in the road . " " I do n't want to touch it . " She opened the door but he said " Let 's go " and got in and shifted and drove slowly by , his wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ branch . Then the car was hidden by trees and he listened to it going faster up the road . and laughing he stood and squeezed Mark 's shoulders and hopped and skipped in a circle , pulling Mark with him , forcing the sound of his laughter faster when it slowed and louder when it lulled ; he stopped dancing and laughing , but still quivering with jubilance , he squeezed Mark 's shoulder and shouted : " I do n't want to touch it . " 53 W HEN HE RODE his bicycle up the driveway , the sun was low above the trees across the lake , and his mother and sisters were still at the glass table ; then coming out of the garage , he saw that it was not still but again : his mother and Julie wore dresses and Stephanie wore shorts ; beyond them , downwind , smoke rose from charcoal in the wheeled grill . " I 'll be right down , " he said . " I 'm coming up , " his mother said . He went into the pale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the screen door open and shut , and the clack of her steps on the kitchen floor then muted by carpets as she followed him up . His room was sunlit . He looked down at Julie and Stephanie , then turned to face the door a moment before she entered it . Her dress was white and , between its straps . a pearl necklace lay on her tan skin . She had a cigarette in one hand and a drink in the other : a tall clear one with a piece of lime among the bubbles and ice . " Did you have a good day ? " wyes. , , " Where did you go ? " " Bike riding . " She put her drink on the chest of drawers and flicked ashes into her hand . " That 's quite a workout . " " We went to the woods too . " " You were right across the lake ? " " The big woods . By the highway . " " Oh . You said  --  Mark ? ? moved here yesterday ? When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Where ? " " Here . He was looking around . " " Well I do n't want to " ? she glanced at her drink , drew on her cigarette , flicked ashes in her hand ? " I do n't want to make a big thing out of it , but why did n't you tell me ? " " I do n't know . " " You really do n't ? That 's so  --  I do n't know . it 's so strange . " With forefinger and thumb of her ash hand she picked up her drink . " Well . Will you do something for me ? Ask him to come over sometime when I 'm home . We 'll have dinner . Will you do that ? " " I 'll ask him . " He looked at the cigarette burning close to her fingers . . " Good . I like meeting your friends . You have time to shower before dinner , pal . " " I was about to . " She smiled and left and he followed her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved down the hall , gingerly holding the drink and cigarette : " Will I have time to swim ? " " Plenty of time , " she called over her shoulder . " It 's pork . " T HE APARTMENT in Philadelphia smelled of the city , not only exhaust but something else that came through the open windows : a staleness , as though Phila-delphia itself were enclosed by ceiling and walls , and today 's breeze carried to his lungs yesterday 's cement and stirred dust ; when the windows were closed , the apartment 's motionless air had no smell and that too , for Walter , was Philadelphia . With his father in the apartment she had filled with plants was blonde Jenny who , that first morning when he visited them for a weekend , knocked on his door and he woke remembering where he was and said Yes and she came in with a tray holding hot chocolate and bread she had baked last night , wrapped in hot foil  --  that child , his mother had said , that child . With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is she ? There are n't any more hippies . I 'm sorry , children , he 's your father but I can not can not live quietly through this mad time . She was born the year we were married and I 've spent twenty-two years giving my life to my husband and my home and now it feels like I was just taking care of him while she did nothing but get taller and busty so he could leave with her ? Jenny sat on the bed and talked to him while he drank the chocolate and ate the bread and liked her , and understood his father 's loving her , and so shared his father 's guilt . He was the first to visit ; in two weeks Stephanie would come , and then Julie , because there was only the one guest room , his father said , and his mother said : He 's protecting that girl from handling all of you at once . Jenny said : You probably do n't like breakfast in bed and he said : No , not even when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and said : I do n't either . I 'll stop trying so hard . Are you all right ? At first he thought she meant the bed , the room , his hunger , then looking at her he knew she did n't , and he said : Yes . And Stephanie and Julie ? They 'll be all right . They 're not now ? They 'll get better . Is your mom ? No . That 's why they 're not . It 's awful . I wish  --  He wanted to hear the wish : perhaps behind her worried blue eyes she wished his father had no wife , no children , that he and his mother and Julie and Stephanie were dead or had never lived ; now sadly he saw them , the woman and girls he had left at home : they were in the living room , talking , then they vanished ; for moments their voices lingered in the room and then faded with them into space . There 's too much to wish , she said ; there 's nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what ? That nobody 's hurt too badly for too long . Sunday night he boarded an airplane for 54 the second time in three days and in his life ; he had spent most of the flight Friday afternoon imagining the weekend , making himself shy and awkwardly intrusive in his father 's new home and life before he saw either . He had met Jenny , had eaten dinner in restaurants with her and his father and sisters ; but that was all . Sunday in the plane he liked being alone with the small light over his head and ? the black sky at his cool window ; a man sat beside him , but he was alone : no one knew him , and when the stewardess spoke to him as though he were either boy or man , he felt that his age as well as his name had remained on the earth . Philadelphia was done ; Philadelphia was good ; he could go back , and now he was going home . His mother and sisters ate dinner in Boston , then met him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Stephanie ; the night was cool and in the closed car he remembered what he had forgotten to remember until now : Jenny and his father smelled of soap and cloth and flesh , and no smoke drifted toward his face through the still air of their rooms . He started to say this , nearly said : At least she does n't smoke ; then he knew he must not . " So how was it , " Stephanie said , and watching his mother in part profile , hair . and upper cheek , her hand on the wheel , smoke pluming from her mouth he could not see , he told of the weekend without once saying Jenny . For the next few nights , when at dinner they questioned him or he remembered something about the weekend that he wanted to make alive again with words so it would be more than just a memory , he glanced from his sisters to his mother 's face , her eyes quick and lips severely set , and said Dad and we and all but twice was able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no longer bear the shame of loving two women and betraying them , both , and he kept his memories in silence . Then Stephanie went to Philadelphia and came back and he watched his mother 's face at the dinners and said nothing or little and began to rid himself of shame , and in the week after Julie 's visit lie knew he had never had reason for shame , that he had not been afraid to tell his mother he loved Jenny too , that it was not he but she who needed the lie ; and , loving her , he felt detached and older and at times he was lonely . The extended family , she calls us . I hope we can be like sisters someday ; she actually said that . What did you say ? I wanted to say Right , airhead : incest . She gives him three eggs a week . She does n't know what to call him . When she talks about him to us . She said that . She feels funny when she says Walter and funny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do ? She takes turns . And if she 's talking to him she says Hon. Or Darling . No : nobody says darling except in books . She watches his salt too . And every day before dinner they go to this health club and swim . How cute . She 's the one who needs it , old thunder thighs . She had a pimple . She looks out of those big blue eyes and talks about how much he cares about us and I wanted to tell her if he cares so much why is he here with you and she 's got a pimple on her chin He watched them : their faces over plates of food glowed with malice , the timbre of their voices was sensually wicked , their throaty laughter mischievous . They were eerie and fascinating ; he had never seen them like this . He knew his silence was not disloyal to his father and Jenny ; sometimes he gave his mother 's eyes what they had to see : he smiled , even laughed . A T NIGHT THE handkerchief was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ headlights , and he knew that to the driver it had . suddenly appeared without locomotion or support , and the cars stopped faster , and the voices from them were more frightened and then more angry . One night they rode past the woods to the bridge over the highway and leaned on the steel fence and watched the four lanes of cars coming to them and passing below . They pressed against the vertical railings and pissed arcs dropping into headlights . " I 've got to shit , " he said , and started for the woods . " Wait . We can use that , " He stopped and looked at Mark , then clown at the cars . " You think I 'm going to squat on that little fence and shit over the highway ? " Near the bridge the woods ended at a small clearing before the slope going steeply down to the highway . Among beer bottles and cans Mark found a paper bag . It wo n't do anything , " Walter said . When it hits the car . 1 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " No. " w e 11 get some . Go on . " He started to go into the woods , but Mark turned and walked back to the bridge , so he squatted in the clearing and looked at bottles and tire tracks in the grass that was high enough to tickle his shins , and wondered when the teenagers parked here ; he had seen them : once there were three or four cars and boys and girls sitting on fenders or standing , but the other times it was only one car nestled in the shadows of the woods , dully and for an instant reflecting his mother 's headlights as she drove off the bridge . Always he had seen them from his mother 's car , when they had been to a movie or dinner and were coming home late . Carrying the bag away from his body , he went onto the bridge , his face turned to the breeze . " If we wait , we can get some parkers , " he said . " Get our asses whipped too . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the air out of the back tires , then throw this in the front window . " " What do you think he 'll be doing while all that hissing is going on ? " " Getting out and beating our asses . We could get close enough to listen , though . Maybe even look in . " " Now you 're talking . Maybe we can think ? up a trap . Something he 'd drive into and could n't get out of . Let 's go find a front porch to burn your dinner on . " With headlights on , they rode fast over the winding road , past the woods and then open country where the lighted houses were separated by low ridges and shallow draws and trees planted in lines and orchards , and up Walter 's driveway , onto the terrace , where he placed the bag beside his kickstand . In the kitchen they looked on counters and in drawers and behind the bar . " They use lighters . " He went upstairs with Mark following , into his mother 's room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment , looking at her wide bed covered with light blue , and felt behind him Mark breathing the air of the room while his eyes probed it . He moved to the dresser and when Mark pulled open a drawer of the chest at another wall , he raised his face and looked at himself in the mirror . Then he looked down , and between a hairbrush and ashtray saw a glossy black matchbook bearing a name in gold script . " Let 's go , " he said , and crossed the room and closed the drawer as Mark 's hand , dropping a stack of silk pants , withdrew . He did not know any of the neighbors well enough to choose a target , so with lights off they rode to the last house before the woods and walked their bicycles up the long driveway between tall trees , and laid them on the ground where the pavement curved and rose through open lawn to the garage beside the house . Upstairs one room was lighted , and light came through the two high windows on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ narrow roof and two columns . At the base of a tree they lay on their bellies and watched the windows , and Mark whispered : " Do n't ever think your shit does n't stink , " and they pressed hands against their mouths and laughed through their noses . Then crouching they ran to the front porch and listened and heard nothing . Walter set the bag near the screen door and unfolded its top and listened again , then struck the match and held the flame to one corner of the opening , and then another , and stood , and when fire was moving down the sides , Mark pressed the doorbell and held it chiming inside the house , then they ran to the tree , and Walter dived beside it and rolled behind it next to Mark . The door swung inward , a short wide man stepped into its frame , then said something fast and low , and pushed open the screen and with one foot stomped the flames smaller and smaller to embers and smoke . then he cursed , and Mark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavy running steps coming as he ran beside his bicycle down the driveway and jumped onto the seat , passing Mark before the road , where he turned and pumped for the woods . CROSS THE GLASS table Mark 's wet A hair was sleek in the sunlight . He sat beside Julie ; the sun , nearing the trees across the lake , was behind and just above him , so that Walter squinted at him . Walter 's mother had thawed chicken , then when she came home early from the boutique she had bought after going to court with his father , she said she had decided on hamburgers because some people were clumsy about eating barbecued chicken with a knife and fork and she did n't want to make it hard on him . Walter had said Mark could eat chicken with his hands , and she said she knew he could and Waiter would like to , and that 's what she meant about making it hard on Mark . She could clean the bones of a chicken with knife and fork as daintily as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her with a hamburger : it was thick and it dripped catsup and juice from the meat and tomatoes and pickles ; she leaned over the plate , and opened her mouth wide enough to close on both buns , yet with that width of jaws she took only a small bite from the edge and lowered the hamburger , then sat straight to chew with her lips closed . Julie 's and Stephanie 's bites were larger but still small , and neither had to use a napkin . He and Mark had stayed in the pool until now , so his mother was asking questions between eating : where he was from and what his father did and did his mother work , how many brothers and sisters and where had he gone to school . Some of this was new to Walter ; the rest of it he had learned in the woods , during the heat of afternoons as they lay on cool shadowed grass and spoke to avoid silence . His mother 's questions ended before her hamburger did ; she held her wine glass toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And your sisters , " and he reached to their places and poured , then held the bottle over Mark 's glass of milk , and Mark said : " Go ahead . " " Just two more years , " his mother said , and she leaned toward him and tousled his wet hair . " This boy of mine , " she said to Mark , and dried her hand with her napkin . " He 'll be doing more than wine in two more years , " Julie said . " A lot more , " Stephanie said , and smiled at Mark . " Like what ? " Walter said . " You 'll have a girl , " Julie said . " Maybe not . " " You will . Some girl will take care of that . " " Wow , " he said to Mark . " I 'll have a date . " " In the car , " Mark said . " With a girt . " " And you 'll love it , " his mother said . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the mirror . We have blueberry pie and ice cream . " " Tell me you did n't , " Stephanie said . " Not blueberry . I 'm going to be very fat tonight . " " You might get an older man , " his mother said . " Dessert is for these boys who swim and ride bikes all day . " " I swam this morning , " Stephanie said , and stood , and then Julie and his mother did . and when he pushed back his chair she said : " Stay with your guest . We 'll do it , " and they were all in motion , clearing and wiping the table and setting it again with ashtrays and cigarette packs and plates and three demitasses and a silver coffee pot , and pie and ice cream for everyone , though he and Mark had the biggest slices and scoops . When his mother reached for her cigarettes , he stood and said : " Let 's go down to the lake . " He rolled his napkin and pushed it into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told him to leave it , the guest napkin gets washed . Near the bank of the lake he found a small flat rock and skimmed it , hitting once on the sunlit surface and three times in the shadows before it sank . He paced up and down , looking for another rock , and Mark lay on the grass in the sun , and said : " They 're pretty . " He sat beside Mark and looked at the flowers of purple loosestrife and then at a crow rising from the trees . " Sometimes I wish I lived with my father . " " Can you ? " " They never asked me to . " He did not like the sound of his voice ; in its softening he heard tears coming , and for a long time he had not cried about anything . He sat up and plucked a blade of grass and chewed it . Julie did not like the monthly visits to his father because she missed her boyfriend , and Stephanie did not like them because she could not smoke there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them had forgiven his father . He would like to spend the school year with his father and Jenny and the summer here , and he knew now that for a long time he had made himself believe his father had never asked or even hinted because the apartment was too small . " Do they fuck ? " Mark said . , 4Who ? , , He pointed a thumb over his shoulder , and Walter turned and looked up the hill ; sunlight splashed bronze on their hair . " How would I know ? " he said , and looked at his bare toes in the grass . " Lots of ways , if you wanted to . " " I never thought about it . " " You 're weird . " " Sometimes I think about it . When they go out . " cries and grunts and , between their legs , sloshing thuds ; heard these as he waited and as they climbed the stairs and turned on faucets and flushed toilets  --  Did it drip out of them and drop spreading and slowly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair he had never seen , and did they  --  wipe it then with paper , the motion of arm and hand , the expressions on their faces as common as if nothing were there and in the water below their  --  again : naked  --  flesh but piss ? Or did it stay in the diaphragm that Mark said was shaped like half an orange peel with the fruit gone ? He tightened his legs and arms , shook his head on the pillow , shut his eyes to a darker dark ; between his legs he felt nothing . When did they take it out ? And how did their faces took when they took it out ? He saw them frowning , nauseated , wickedly pleased . Once he had a large boil on his leg and the doctor froze it and lanced it and for weeks he had to fight his memory when he ate . He could not imagine them now in clothes , nor in bathing suits , nor simply eating on the terrace or at the kitchen or dining-room table ; he tried to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and walking with short careful steps over the icy sidewalk , moving into the vapor of their breath as it wafted about their heads . But he could not , as though all he had known of them clothed was a mask that tonight he had pulled from their faces . When at last his mother 's steps ended , he imagined them all settled between sheets , their legs closed now , at rest , and he thought : They must stink . E WOKE TO a bird 's shriek and sun-light , and went barefooted down the hall , looking at each door closed on the darkened blind-drawn cool of the room and bed and soft breathing of sleep , and out of the house and onto his bicycle . He rode toward the woods . He was hungry and thirsty and had not brushed his teeth , so the taste of night was still in his mouth , and he opened it to the breeze . Then he was there : the fra-grance of pines sharper among the other smells of green life and earth and the old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walked his bicycle without trail or pat-tern between and under tall trees and around brush , the sweat from his ride drying now , cooling him in the shade as he moved farther into the woods that had waked while he slept : above him squirrels rustled leaves as they moved higher and birds fluttered from perches and twice he heard the sudden flight of a rabbit . In a glade lit by the sun he stood up his bicycle and lay on his back with hands 59 clasped behind his head and closed his eyes . The sun warmed his face , and beneath his eyelids he felt the heat and saw specks of red and orange in the darkness , and he tried to see them as he had known them , but he could not dress them , could not cover their nakedness , and could not keep them naked alone : behind his eyes they slowly revolved , coupling with the two boys and the man , and he tried to see nothing at all but the speckled dark , and then tried to see the food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and then tried to concentrate his rage only on the two boys and the man whose faces had the glazed look of a dog 's above the bitch 's back , but he could not do that either , and the sounds from the six writhing bodies were louder than the woods . He stood and moved out of the sunlight , into the shade of a maple , and unzipped and pissed , then stroked , shutting his eyes against the softness his hand encircled , seeing an infected and oozing orange peel , the softness even receding as though trying to withdraw from his abrasive fingers . He opened his eyes . Then he lay on his belly in the sunlight and pressed his cheek against the earth and held its grass with both hands . W E HAD TO LEAVE be fore you came home . We went shopping in Boston and will be back before dinner . Mark was looking for you and said he 'd be back after lunch . Love , Mom , and a smiling line for a mouth drawn inside a circle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ note on the table in front of him while he ate cereal and a peanut-butter sandwich , then he took the small garbage basket from under the sink and went upstairs . He went to Stephanie 's room first . It was still darkened and he opened the blinds and looked at the tossed-back top sheet and bedspread and stuffed brown bear and blue rabbit near a pillow ; actors and singers watched him from the walls ; he opened the drawer and took out the case and opened it with a click that tensed his arms . It 's more like a hollowed-out mushroom ; then he realized he was holding his breath , and he let it out , and breathing fast and shallow he turned the case over and watched the diaphragm drop softly among banana peels and milk carton and tuna-fish can . As he put the case under silk in the drawer , he knew why he had gone to her room first : the youngest , only a few years removed from the time when pranks on each other were as much part of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a plastic bag . He brought it to Julie 's room , and opened her blinds and was crossing the floor when his name rose from outside , into the room ; he stood still , gripping the basket , while Mark called again then rang the back doorbell and called and then was quiet , but Walter could feel him down there , and he stood looking at the soft yellow wall , listening to the slow breeze and a car coming and passing by , then crept to the window and looked down at the empty terrace . Quickly he took the case from the drawer and emptied it in the basket . In his mother 's room he did not open the blinds ; he walked softly as though she were sleeping there ; he glanced at the sheets and pillows , and quietly slid open the drawer where last night Mark had found it , the first one they had found , while Walter was opening leather boxes of jewelry at her dresser and telling Mark to start in another room so they could work faster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the open case in both hands . He lifted it closer to his eyes . He looked at it until his breathing slowed ; and when he stopped hearing his breathing , he was suddenly tired , and as he lowered one hand and turned the other and watched the brief white descent , he wanted to sleep . T HEIR VOICES woke him , and when they started up the stairs , he turned quietly onto his side , his back to the door , and heard the girls with soft-crackling shopping bags going into their rooms and his mother coming to his ; she stopped at the doorway and he breathed as though asleep until she turned and went to her room . He opened his eyes to the lake and trees and the low sun . He waited until he heard showers in all three bathrooms . Then he ran on tiptoes down the hall and stairs , and at the terrace he sprinted : past the pool and down toward the widening lake , and fell forward and struck with knees and palms , and rolled and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , leaping when his balance shifted forward : running and leaping to the bottom of the hill where he could not stop : with short flat-footed steps he went across the narrow mud bank and into the water deep as his knees and then was sitting in it . He stood and looked up at the house , and higher and beyond it at the sky . Then he eased backward into the water and floated . Behind him the geese stirred and he listened to their wings as they rose and settled again . He backstroked toward the middle , then floated . Now the trees were on his left and he looked at their green crowns and the sky and waited for his mother 's voice calling from the terrace . ? 60
