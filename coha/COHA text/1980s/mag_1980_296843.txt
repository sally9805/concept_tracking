Kennedy prepares to fight Carter at the convention <P> He lost most of his party 's primaries and trails badly in the delegate count , but Senator Edward Kennedy continues to push for the Democratic presidential nomination as if the fight were just beginning . He has vowed to carry his campaign onto the convention floor next month in New York City 's Madison Square Garden , scene of many bloody championship bouts . The purpose of his stubborn crusade , Kennedy explained at a lunch last week with TIME editors , was to allow the party to take into account " the very basic and fundamental changes in circumstances , " including the nation 's economy , since the primaries , changes that Kennedy thinks are hurting Carter badly . Said Kennedy : " I do not think the Democratic Party is prepared to concede defeat . Democrats are going to look around in August and see their potential nominee in some parts of the country is running third . " <P> The battle was fiercely joined last week in Washington before the Carter-dominated convention rules committee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approve a measure that would bind delegates on the first ballot to vote for the candidate whom they were elected to support . With such a rule , Carter would be assured of getting far more first ballot votes than the 1,666 needed for the nomination ; going into the convention , the President leads Kennedy 1,982 to 1,235 in delegates . Thus the Senator 's only hope of a long-shot victory depends on his wooing votes from Carter . <P> Sporting buttons proclaiming FREE THE CARTER 2,000 the Senator 's managers pushed for a resolution that would allow delegates to vote for any candidate . They argued that delegates at past Democratic Conventions had been free-in theory , at least-to vote for whomever they wanted , even on the first ballot . Joseph Rauh , a longtime liberal activist , declared that the loyalty rule would prohibit any action at the convention and " turn the Democratic Party from a deliberative body to a group of robots . " But Carter 's backers at the rules panel ridiculed the Kennedy proposal . Said South Carolina 's Don Fowler : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million Democratic votes we change our minds now , the people wo n't stand for it . " <P> Kennedy 's tenacity has enraged the Carter camp , which fears a fatal party split . Warned San Francisco Mayor Dianne Feinstein at last week 's rules session : " You are about to hand the presidency to Ronald Reagan on a silver platter . I beg you not to do it . " <P> After 2 hrs. of debate , the Carterites won , 87 to 66 , and the rule binding the delegates will be recommended for adoption at next month 's convention , where the battle will be fought for a second and final time while the nation watches on television .
