For me this book is also a postscript to Andrei 's memoirs . I was their initiator and , later , typist , editor and nursemaid . I had to do everything as the nursemaid  --  to make sure the manuscript survived and became a book and reached its readers  --  and to tell that story alone would call for another volume of memoirs or perhaps a mystery book ; but the time for that has not come . <P> Andryusha worked on his memoirs in Gorky , periodically rewriting sections . Not because of the author 's severity or the grumblings of his first reader , first editor and first typist ( all of them me )  --  no ! Because of another 's will and another 's hand . Sections kept vanishing . Once from the apartment in Moscow ; once stolen along with his bag at the dental clinic in Gorky ; once from our parked car , which had been broken into , with Andrei knocked out by some drug . Each time he rewrote his book . Each time there was something new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a different subject . <P> The day after his bag was stolen at the dental clinic , Andrei met me at the train station . He looked haggard , as if he were suffering from insomnia or prolonged illness . His lips were trembling and his voice broke : " Lusia , they stole it . " He spoke with acute pain . <P> When the bag was stolen from our car , Andrei walked from the vehicle toward me . His expression was that of a man who had just learned of the death of someone close to him . But after a few days he would sit down at his desk again . Andrei has a talent for finishing what he starts . <P> What I had to do was to develop a talent " to save , " and I developed it , God knows . I tried to make sure that " manuscripts do n't burn , " to borrow a phrase from Mikhail Bulgakov 's novel The Master and Margarita  --  and to make sure that Andrei 's writing would not rot in the cellars of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1982 , I went to Moscow . I was searched on the train , which was shunted onto a siding far beyond the Moscow station . They took away a chunk of his manuscript  --  burned again ! <P> What they confiscated on the train was the fourth loss . There were others to come . So do n't be surprised that I call myself a talent . The book will come . It already exists .
