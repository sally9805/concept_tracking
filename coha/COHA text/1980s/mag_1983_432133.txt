 | It was just before 3 o'clock on a brisk December afternoon when the computers in New York began to flash the alarm . Banco do Brasil , the commercial arm of the Brazilian central bank , was short more than $50 million on its obligations for the day ? and unless the money was obtained within the next two hours , South America 's leading economic power would default on more than $80 billion of debt . Apocalyptic rumors swept the markets as panicky officials scrambled to raise new funds . In the end they succeeded when , after dozens of wires and phone calls , three American banks agreed to make a short-term loan . The world 's financial system had survived another day . That incident , more than any other , focused global attention on the growing danger of Third World debt . In the days and weeks that followed , government officials and private bankers worked furiously with the International Monetary Fund to shore up the finances of such major debtors as Brazil , Mexico , Argentina , Hungary and Yugoslavia . Creditor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a special fund to cope with emergencies ; bankers , meanwhile , promised not to withhold vital credit . Those actions , together with the promise of economic recovery , held the threat of international bankruptcy at bay . " The system has proven viable , " insists U.S. Treasury Secretary Donald Regan . " We have been able to prevent any type of world economic crisis even though it 's been forecast by many economists . " Ticking . Perhaps so , but there were signs last week that the rescue was only a respite . Less than three months after signing a $3.9 billion bailout agreement with the IMF , Brazil had fallen hundreds of millions of dollars behind on its scheduled interest payments ; private banks had failed to come through with some $3 billion of promised trade and liquidity financing , and the nation was once again running dangerously low on cash . Peruvian officials were attempting to stretch out payments on $2 billion of shortterm obligations , and Nigeria was reluctantly seeking as much as $2.5 billion from the IMF . Against that already worrisome background @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prices , portending additional burdens on oil exporters like Mexico , Nigeria , Venezuela and Indonesia . " The debt bomb is still ticking , " concludes C. Fred Bergsten , president of the Institute for International Economics . " The outcome will turn primarily on the course of the world economy as a whole . " Most bankers and economists are convinced that the debt problem can , for the moment , be coped with . The dangers of a Brazilian or Mexican collapse are so great that money will almost certainly be available to paper over any temporary cash shortfall , and as the economic recovery continues , the prospects for many debtors appear increasingly bright . Richard M. Young , a senior economist for Chase Econometrics , calculates that the drop in interest rates since last summer has saved Latin American debtors about $1.5 billion a month in interest payments . And since last December , rising demand has increased the prices of commodities other than oil by 16 percent , greatly expanding the export earnings of much of the Third World . In addition , many of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to discourage imports while making their goods more attractive to the world . Mexican exports , for example , are outstripping imports at the rate of more than $8 billion a year , and the trade accounts of both Brazil and Argentina are also beginning to show healthy surpluses . Impaired : The problem , however , is that those same austerity programs are exerting a drag on general economic growth . In recent years , the United States has sold about 40 percent of its exports to the developing nations , and as those countries continue to tighten their belts , American exports must inevitably shrink . Economist Sam I. Nakagama notes , for example , that before the Mexican debt crisis hit in full force last August , American exports to Mexico were running at an annual rate of $14.4 billion . By the fourth quarter of 1982 , Mexicans were buying American goods at an annual rate of only $7.1 billion , and Nakagama contends that the drop was an important factor in the sharp fourth-quarter decline in American economic output . What 's more , to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be importing relatively less from the Third World . Last week , U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz warned that " there is no nobility in more austerity than is temporarily necessary to achieve a new base for growth . " Many economists complain that much of the austerity is due to timidity on the part of private banks . IMF managing director Jacques de Larosiere has recently been insisting that commercial banks agree to substantial new loans before the agency will commit its own funds to troubled borrow- ?  | ? ers ? and , faced with the catastrophic alter ? native of having a major customer default on its loans , the banks have been willing to agree . In the case of Brazil , though , many small banks ? particularly in Switzerland , Italy and France ? have already begun to welsh on the deal , leaving Brazil $3 billion in the hole . And in instances where the IMF is not involved , new bank lending is falling fast . In 1981 the developing nations received $47 billion in new bank loans ; last year the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even more in 1983 . " The small banks are claiming that they are close to their legally imposed country lending limits , " says one Treasury official . " But that 's crap . They just do n't want to lend to these countries and will make up any excuse they can . " The lack of credit has already imposed severe strains on the debtors ' domestic economies . Brazilian inflation is running at an unprecedented 117 percent , while nearly one-third of the nation 's work force is unemployed . In Mexico , where the government claims it can not afford to implement an unemployment-insurance system , workers are planning a paralyzing strike on May 30 if their demands for a 50 percent wage increase are not met . " I do n't think Mexico would be able to maintain a stagnant economy for more than two years , " Finance Minister Jesus Silva Herzog told The Washington Post last week . If the Mexican recession drags on beyond 1984 , he added , " it will certainly pose additional risks for . . . social and political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are becoming increasingly concerned about the politics of debt . Venezuela is rapidly depleting its foreign currency reserves , but the government is resisting an approach to the IMF until after the national elections in December . Argentina is even more worrisome . After a recent trip to Buenos Aires , Deputy Treasury Secretary R. T. McNamar reported that a " decision-making paralysis " was setting in among economic policymakers who feared to make even the most mundane decisions lest it cost them their jobs ? or even their lives ? should the government change drastically after the fall elections . And bankers were not encouraged by the recent call by Bolivian President Hunan Siles Zuazo for the formation of a " cartel " in which the major debtors would declare a moratorium on repayments until creditors negotiated new and easier terms . And there is always the possibility of surprises . " Unforeseen events do happen , " warns Robert Heller , chief international economist at the Bank of America , " and they tend to be bad news . Bad weather could cut the Brazilian coffee harvest in half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Honduras could have a disastrous banana crop . " Worst of all would be a new drop in the price of crude oil . By most projections , the recovery is not expected to bring much increase in the demand for oil , and with so many oil-producing nations in precarious financial condition , the pressure to cheat on OPEC 's benchmark $29-a-barrel price will be immense . Recent reports indicate , for example , that Iran has secretly been offering discounts of as much as $2 a barrel on longterm contracts to countries such as Japan . Timing . At first glance , a renewed decline in oil prices might seem an unalloyed blessing for non-oil-exporting developing countries . Brazil would save roughly $500 million a year for each $1-a-barrel drop in petroleum prices . It would also benefit from the faster growth in the developed nations that lower oil prices would bring . The problem , however , is one of timing . A sudden drop in oil prices would help the Brazilians only gradually , says one New York banker , but its impact on the likes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ markets . " Suddenly millions of dollars would not be available " to the oil exporters , he says . " Loans might be called , " and as banks began to recognize the possibility of large loan losses , credit would immediately contract for the entire Third World . Perhaps the scariest scenario is one in which the global recovery fizzles prematurely . Once again the borrowing nations would be faced with a debilitating drop in their export earnings . Overextended banks would likely lock their vaults to new lending . And commerce would continue to contract ? until the major debtors declared a moratorium on repayment . Then , with the banks suffering major losses , even existing credit would not be renewed . Developing countries would no longer be able to afford more than minimal imports , deepening the recession in the industrial world . Although such an outcome is extremely unlikely , it could set off a downward spiral that might sink the world into a depression . Compounding the problems of international debtors are the growing budget deficits in the United States . Not only do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economists contend , but they also attract significant amounts of investment capital from overseas . Last year , at a time when many countries were hard pressed to pay their largely dollar-denominated international bills , the United States sucked in $53 billion from overseas sources . Brazilian Finance Minister Ernane Galveas suggests that one way to redress that imbalance would be for the United States and other developed countries to provide special tax breaks on interest and dividends earned from investments in the poorer countries . That proposal is not likely to be popular in Washington ? but neither is the prescription of Martin Feldstein , chairman  | of the Council of Economic Advisers . To restore liquidity to the needier nations , he insists , the United States must be prepared to run significant trade deficits with the developing countries for at least as long as American budget overruns remain high . Other experts have suggested that the only way the international debt crisis can be managed over the long term is to take it out of the hands of the commercial banks . Under a plan proposed by Princeton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Jersey , the IMF or some other international agency would buy up the banks ' loans at 90 cents on the dollar . The agency would pay the banks in longterm bonds while simultaneously extending longer and more generous credit terms to troubled borrowers . Norman Bailey , a member of the National Security Council staff , has an even more radical proposal to replace developing countries ' debt with something akin to stock , entitling banks to a share of the countries ' export earnings . Such ideas have little chance of being considered seriously unless disaster strikes . For the moment , the only real hope for financial stability is the recovery that is just now under way . " The overhanging debt of the developing countries will be the problem of the ' 80s just the way OPEC was the problem of the ' 70s , " says one influential private banker . " And the debt will mean that economic prosperity wo n't be as high as it could be . " The real trick will be to ensure that economic growth continues , for without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decline . @# 36
