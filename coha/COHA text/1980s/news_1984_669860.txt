NEW YORK  --  Bond prices slumped yesterday , giving back part of the large gains registered Monday . But trading activity was light amid continued nervousness about the economic outlook . Prices of some U.S. government bonds , which soared more than two points Monday , fell yesterday by about seven-eighths of a point , or around $8. 75 for each $1 , 000 face amount of securities . Interest rates rose on short-term Treasury bills , partly reflecting an increase in the size of the government ' s regular weekly auction of 13-week and 26-week bills . The Treasury yesterday said it plans to sell a record $13. 2 billion of the bills at next Monday ' s auction , up from the $12. 8 billion sold this past Monday . Separately , the government yesterday sold $8. 26 billion of new 52-week bills at an average rate of 10. 99% , the highest in almost two years . It was up from 10. 92% at the previous auction of similar bills on June 7 and was the highest since Table an average of 11. 195% on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of yesterday ' s bond-market setback to profit-taking by dealers following a rally that began early last Friday . Prices of some issues soared more than 3 1/4 points from Friday ' s low point to Monday ' s close . <> " The market ran into a bit of profit-taking , " said Elliott Platt , senior vice president and economist at Donaldson , Lufkin &; Jenrette . Still , " my attitude is fairly constructive " about the outlook for bonds , he said , adding that he sees a possibility of " slight declines " in bond yields by yearend . Mr. Platt expects inflation to remain " moderate " over the balance of this year . He predicted an inflation rate of " no more than 5% to 5 1/2% in the second half of this year and in 1985 . " Nevertheless , short-term interest rates are likely to " drift upward , " Mr. Platt said . The Federal Reserve System ' s policy-making arm , known as the Federal Open Market Committee , will vote at its meeting next Monday and Tuesday " to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Fed officials " will want to tighten credit as a precaution against the possibility that the strong growth in the economy will eventually lead to a severe re-acceleration of inflation . " Some economists fear that inflation will reignite if the Fed doesn ' t tighten its credit clamp significantly . " I don ' t see much room for optimism " about the outlook for interest rates and inflation , said Mickey D. Levy , senior vice president and chief economist at Fidelity Bank in Philadelphia . " Housing seems to be the only sector in the economy showing sensitivity to high interest rates , " Mr. Levy said . " It ' s probably becoming apparent to the Fed that still higher interest rates will be needed to slow the economy significantly . " The nation ' s basic money supply , known as M1 , is expanding too rapidly , Mr. Levy contended . He said M1 ' s recent growth rate will support economic expansion that is too rapid to keep inflation in check . " Unless the Fed slows M1 ' s annual growth rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warned . Mr. Platt of Donaldson Lufkin estimated that figures to be released tomorrow will show M1 grew at an 11. 4% annual clip during June . That would put its second-quarter growth rate at 8. 1% , well above the Fed ' s interim target of 6. 5% for the period . The M1 measure consists of cash and checking deposits held by the public . Because it represents funds readily available for spending , it is considered by many analysts to be an important determinant of the economy and inflation . A broader measure , known as M2 , increased at about a 7. 6% annual clip in the second quarter , Mr. Platt estimated . That would be just below the Fed ' s secondquarter target of 8% . An even broader yardstick , M3 , soared at a 10. 4% clip in the quarter , according to Mr. Platt ' s estimates . The Fed was seeking an 8. 5% growth rate . The M2 measure includes everything in M1 plus most types of personal savings , including money-market funds and money-market deposit accounts . The M3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certificates of deposit and money-market funds designed for institutions . " The psychological roots of inflation have not been removed , " said Raymond F. DeVoe Jr. , market strategist at Legg Mason Wood Walker Inc . In a recent report , he warned that inflation " can return with surprising rapidity . " Some measures of the inflation outlook are painting a bleak picture . One such measure , the leading index of inflation compiled by the Center for International Business Cycle Research at Columbia University ' s graduate school of business , " has continued to advance sharply , projecting further increases in the rate of inflation , " according to Table Geoffrey H. Moore , director of the center . In the credit markets yesterday , the Treasury ' s 13 1/4% bonds due 2014 closed at a price of 99 1/2 , down from 100 13/32 Monday . That raised the yield to 13. 31% from 13. 18% . The government ' s 13 1/8% notes due 1994 fell to 97 21/32 from 98 17/32 , boosting the yield to 13. 55% from 13. 38% . Among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10. 12% bid , up from an average of 10. 04% set at Monday ' s auction . The latest 26-week bill rose to 10. 58% bid from the auction average of 10. 52% . <> The Federal Reserve injected reserves into the banking system yesterday through repurchase agreements . Under the arrangement , the Fed bought securities from dealers who agreed to buy them back tomorrow . Purchases by the Fed add reserves because dealers place the proceeds into their bank accounts . The interest rate on federal funds , or overnight loans of reserves between banks , hovered between 11 1/4% and 11 3/8% most of the day . That was down from Monday ' s average of 11. 52% . The Federal Reserve may increase its discount rate this month to bring it closer to the federal funds rate , according to many analysts . The discount rate , which is the fee the Fed charges on loans to banks and savings institutions , has been 9% since early April and thus has been a bargain compared with the cost of federal funds . " The economy still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continue , " said Alan C. Lerner , senior vice president and money market economist at Bankers Trust Co . He contended that the economy ' s growth rate remains " above where the Fed would like to see it . " A few analysts argue that Fed officials at next week ' s meeting will vote against any credit-tightening measures because of their concern about strains in the international financial system and because of the dollar ' s recent spectacular rise against other major foreign currencies . Mr. Lerner disagreed . " I ' m sure they ( Fed officials ) are going to worry more about domestic considerations and keeping inflation under control than about the dollar ' s strength , " he said . Mr. Lerner also expects an increase in the federal funds rate , which strongly influences other interest rates . " I would expect we ' ll be dealing with something like an 11 1/2% fed funds rate " later this month , he predicted . In the municipal bond market , a $200 million offering of general obligation bonds by California drew a warm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million of the securities remained unsold among underwriters as of late yesterday afternoon . The bonds were priced after auction to yield from 6. 5% in 1985 to 10. 2% in 2009 . The securities are rated double-A by both Moody ' s Investors Service Inc. and Standard &; Poor ' s Corp . Also selling briskly was a $310 million offering of single-family mortgage bonds by the Ohio Housing Finance Agency . The issue was priced tentatively to yield from 7. 5% in 1986 to 11. 375% in 2010 . Separately , a $50 million issue of revenue bonds by New York State ' s Metropolitan Transportation Authority was tentatively priced to yield from 10. 7% in 1998 to 11. 25% in 2014 , according to Dillon , Read &; Co . The issue is rated Baa by Moody ' s and triple-B-plus by S &; Credit : Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal
