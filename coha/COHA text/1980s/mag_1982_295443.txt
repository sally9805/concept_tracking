No Israeli was particularly surprised to hear Rabbi Meir Kahane extolling Allen Goodman after his wanton shooting in the Dome of the Rock mosque as a " hero who tried to liberate the Temple Mount from the hands the foreigners . " Since 1971 , the Brooklyn-born Kahane , 49 , has become as familiar a figure in Israel for his extreme right-wing views as he was in New York City in the late 1960s , when he founded the Jewish Defense League . Kahane seeks to drive all Palestinians out of the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem . " I want to remove the Arabs of Israel because I do not want to kill them every week as they grow and riot , " he once wrote . <P> Kahane 's organization in Israel is called Kach , and its violent tactics are similar to those that characterized the J.D.L. 's activities in the U.S. Kahane says the group is financed by American sympathizers . " I think there is a great deal of co vert support in the U.S. and in Israel- much more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his Kahane members are young Americans recruited in the U.S. or when they visit Israel . <P> Kach vigilante squads have smashed cars belonging to Arabs , broken into their homes and beaten up res idents . Kahane openly applauds vandalism against Christian and Muslim holy sites in Jerusalem . Kach members are believed to have daubed swastikas and smeared excrement on the Inter national Christian Embassy , a pro-Israeli organization , and to have damaged cars belonging to U.N . personnel . <P> Many Israelis are angered by the seeming impunity with which Kahane and other extremists have been allowed to operate in volatile situations . <P> As Arabs demonstrated in the West Bank , for example , Kahane turned up in uniform for reserve duty in the city of Ramallah . He indiscriminately arrested Arabs and journalists . Last week Jerusalem Mayor Teddy Kollek , himself a victim of Kach hate mail , demanded that the government crack down on what he called " violently extremist Jews who give the impression that they are above the law merely because they are Jewish .
