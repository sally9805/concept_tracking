The 2-acre site of the old Victoria Barracks , located on the very edge of Hong Kong 's commercial district , is prime real estate . Although its buildings are rundown and were abandoned by the British army in 1979 , the parcel should have been worth about $250 million on the basis of similar recent real estate sales . But when the Hong Kong government offered it for sale this month , the bids fell " unacceptably " short , and the sale was postponed , victim to uncertainty over the future of the crown colony . <P> The concern centers on the July 1 , 1997 , deadline when , under the terms of Britain 's 99-year lease , more than 90% of Hong Kong 's land area , the 373-sq. - mi . New Territories , will revert to China . ( Treaties signed in 1841 and 1860 give Britain ownership of the remaining 34 sq . mi. - Hong Kong island and portions of Kowloon- " in perpetuity . " ) Although an arrangement short of total reversion may eventually be worked out between London and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it does now , some fear that China will insist on full sovereignty . That could mean the end of Hong Kong 's capitalistic ways . Reflecting such worries , share prices on the Hong Kong exchange have dropped 21.5% since September , and the value of the Hong Kong dollar has slumped 8.6% against the U.S. dollar . <P> However depressed the colony may be for the moment , Hong Kong 's riches are a prize that others covet . Like heirs surrounding a millionaire 's deathbed , several countries have launched efforts to gather the spoils that might flow from Hong Kong 's demise . In different ways , Taiwan , Thailand , the Philippines and Singapore are all hoping to scoop up some of the estimated $20 billion in capital that could flee Hong Kong before 1997 if the question is not settled . <P> " Overseas Chinese are worried about the future after the expiration of the lease , " explains Chao Yao-tung , Taiwan 's Minister of Economic Affairs and a former businessman , " and we will try to get some of the capital outflow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " To that end , the Taiwan government plans to create a free-trade zone and banking center on the island . In an unregulated , Hong Kong-like environment free of import taxes , businessmen would be able to enter without visas , taxes would be low , and red tape minimal . In the eyes of Taiwan 's rivals , the plan has one crucial draw back : Taipei 's hostile relationship with Peking could deter Hong Kong Chinese investors . <P> Thailand too has entered the Hong Kong sweepstakes . A new top-level government task force is studying how residence restrictions and business taxes could be eased to attract Hong Kong investors . In the Philippines , three business groups have proposed new free-trade ports . Banker-Developer Enrique Zobel even suggests transforming the small , barren island of Mactan , off Cebu city , into a " mini-Hong Kong " and operating it like an autonomous business and trading center .
