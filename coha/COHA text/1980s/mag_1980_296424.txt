GOING IN STYLE <P> Directed and Written by Martin Brest <P> Most bad movies take a few minutes to reveal their worst sins . Going in Style announces its mediocrity right away . As the heroes ( George Burns , Art Carney , Lee Strasberg ) are first seen sitting on a park bench in Queens and making introductory small talk , Going in Style lapses into immediate and terminal catatonia . The actors are listless . The camera does not move . The lines are separated by silences that would give Harold Pinter pause . One strong whiff of Going in Style , and the audience is transported directly to slumberland . For the next 90 minutes , there is little reason to stir . By telling the story of three elderly men who rob a bank , Director-Writer Brest ( Hot Tomorrows ) apparently meant to make a poignant statement about the loneliness and financial indignities that can grip old people . The subject is worthwhile , but Brest never comes close to giving it either tragic or comic life . Except for the funny holdup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Style has only dull , homely sequences that alternately patronize and sentimentalize the aged . The mordant humor of Carl Reiner 's Where 's Poppa ? and the fiery compassion of Paul Mazursky 's Harry and Tonto are nowhere to be found . <P> Brest 's dramatic style is all too literally geratic . His method of shifting mood from farce to pathos is to slow down the tempo of the soundtrack score . He telegraphs each plot point so far ahead that every event seems like a repetition : when Burns silently dreams up his robbery scheme , one can almost see a bulb turn on over his head . Many scenes are mercilessly padded with gratuitous reaction shots or pointless bits of local color ; for this director , the shortest distance between two points is a figure eight . <P> Worse still is Brest 's maltreatment of his cast . Though Burns and Carney are virtually fail-safe comics , the film 's clunky timing robs them of their laughs . The crabby Strasberg is given free rein to show off his entire catalogue of italicized acting gestures . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even when two of the three supposedly lovable heroes die . When a film is as moribund as Going in Style , death is not a tragedy but merely an anticlimax . <P> - Frank Rich
