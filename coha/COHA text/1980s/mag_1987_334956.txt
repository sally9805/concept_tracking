The most ambitious and controversial art-restoration project of the 20th century , the cleaning of Michelangelo 's frescoes in the Sistine Chapel , is in its eighth year , with five years still to go . All the wall lunettes and three of the nine Old Testament scenes on the ceiling are finished , freed of 478 years of accumulated grime , crude repaints and successive coats of darkened glue size applied as a varnish by 17th and 18th century restorers . A quite different Michelangelo , one whose intensity and beauty of color matches his long-acknowledged grandeur as draftsman and iconographer , emerges . The vault of the Sistine is now the domain of light . <P> There is no gain without a sense of loss , however temporary . An equation between the ceiling 's darkness and the profundity of Michelangelo 's mind is old and runs very deep . To find such a father figure decking himself , as it were , in azure , malachite green , rose , yellow , lavender and pink , in the silky and atmospheric sheen of colori cangianti @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still apt to think of color as a feminine rather than a patriarchal attribute . One may recoil , feeling that it is somehow better to embrace the frescoes we know than the ones Michelangelo painted . And given the torment inflicted on great paintings by restorers over the years , one may be suspicious of all cleaning . <P> Hence the controversy that has risen over the past few months as the Vatican 's head restorer , Gianluigi Colalucci , and his team on the scaffold move toward the cleaning of the most famous image in Western art , Michelangelo 's Creation of Adam . <P> The most convinced antis are James Beck , head of the department of art history at Columbia University ; Alexander Eliot , a former art critic of TIME ; and Alessandro Conti , a Florentine historian of restoration technique who published a book on the issue . Eliot makes the ridiculous claim that " nearly half of the Sistine ceiling has already been reduced to postcard quality . " Beck sees the cleaning as a " dangerous step , taken without real knowledge or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shuttle disaster ; Beck , to Chernobyl . <P> Fresco is the most durable kind of painting known . It is done in water- soluble pigments on freshly laid sections of damp plaster  --  the intonaco . When the plaster dries , the color is literally bonded in . Further touches may be put on a secco , on the dry plaster . The antis believe that some of the darkness of the Sistine ceiling and lunettes was put there by Michelangelo himself , in a dark wash of black pigment in glue size , brushed on after the fresco was dry to give more density to the figures and atmosphere to the space . They think this wash is being " indiscriminately " swabbed off along with the dirt . Beck claims that Colalucci and his team , who have done nothing but study the Sistine for the past eight years , have still not studied it enough ; and that the cleaning agent , AB-57 , though used for cleaning fresco and stone since the early 1970s , is still insufficiently tested . The antis also decry the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mannerist , " flat and misleadingly " modern " in color .
