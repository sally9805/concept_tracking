Look , the Red Sox put themselves in the position they ' re in . We don ' t know whether Jerry Kapstein , as the club claims , put them off , but putting off dealing with them until this summer and autumn smacks of the kind of problems they had with Bob Watson and Luis Tiant , problems that were publicly blamed on the players and the agents . Carlton Fisk , Rick Burleson and Fred Lynn is ( or was ) , with the possible blossoming exception of the ' 81 Brewers , the best up-the- middle heart of a team in baseball , and to put off dealing with them was like waiting for oil prices to go down . In 1978 , they could have had their contracts extended in the context of a natural salary structure topped by Jim Rice . They weren ' t . It was suggested many times last winter that they should have found out if they could sign Lynn , and , if not , trade him for what , coming off the .335 , 39 season @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t . Now , they may be open to second-guessing for not taking at least Joel Youngblood and Jeff Reardon from the Mets when the Dodger deal fell through . We can go through this and drudge up management mistakes . But after tomorrow ' s meeting between Player Relations Committee director Ray Grebey and Players Assn. assistant Don Fehr ( Marvin Miller went on vacation Friday ) , drudging up anything in the past except what is in those contracts doesn ' t get us anywhere . Haywood Sullivan took an extreme gamble by sending the contracts out the 22d ( sending them then rather than not sending them at all just accelerated the process toward arbitrator Raymond Goetz ) . As hashed out , the issue is the same whether the players filed for the right to go to salary arbitration or whether they filed for free agency - the validity of the club ' s claim that the addenda changed the option year to a sixth and valid contractural year . He strongly feels that if he ' d sent out the contracts on time and lost the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after reading Burleson ' s contract ) , he ' d have been stuck with $1.5-$2m in salary , a disrupted team and they ' d walk next fall anyway with no compensation . " That way , I lose twice , " he says ; " this way I only lose once . " If they ' re gone , they ' re gone , and he starts over at catcher and center field . In either case , the victory is the same , and he should get something in return , as it seems unlikely either player will ever be seen in a Red Sox uniform again . It seems that even if he lost and Lynn were awarded $1.2m for the 1981 season , Sullivan still could have gotten at least a body --  Ruppert Jones , Joe Beckwith , Youngblood , anything usable -- for them . But Sullivan strongly believes he is right , and in this situation Detroit with John Fetzer and Jim Campbell would probably do the same thing . " Someone has to take a stand sometime for what he believes , " says Sullivan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but if we win it ' s a victory for baseball . " It ' s hard to find many people who think Sullivan will win . The Players Assn. roars with laughter , and even other owners privately cringe . But after spending Thursday preparing the case with Ray Grebey , Sullivan feels optimistic . We don ' t know every clause written in and initialed , we don ' t know every letter , side agreement , etc. that will be entered as testimony . It is interesting that John Harrington , the highly-intelligent assistant in the Dick O ' Connell administration , has joined the club attourneys in the case . Harrington was there when the contract was written , and when it was written the Red Sox say what was written was an agreement by Kapstein and the players to avoid the option year disruptions that destroyed that 1976 team ( anyone around then could never forget Lynn and Burleson singing " Goodbye , Fenway " as the bus pulled out on a June trip ) . It is also interesting that some parties claim that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contracts intentionally late or not at all . If , as the odds say , the two walk , the Red Sox must be prepared for another severe drop in attendance . There are disturbing signs already - the TV ratings drop , the fact that the major Hartford ( which is bigger than Milwaukee ) market outlet ( Ch. 3 ) has switched from the Sox to Yankees . Season ticket money probably will drop when due in February . But maybe if Sullivan had gone the arbitration route , lost and this story had dragged out for another year it would have done even more damage . Could be . Personally , I can ' t wait for February , when the thing is decided , we can stop talking about the past and watching Carney Lansford , Steve Crawford , et al . - There are several questions outstanding in the confusing collapse of the sale of the Indians to Jimmy Nederlander and Neil Papiano . They had alreadyput $1m down and are holding a signed sales agreement , and are outraged at the claim by the present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they promised to cover the debt - because the $500,000 mentioned is pocket change to Nederlander . There are reports that Nederlander and Papiano tried to grab an inordinate percentage of the tax shelter benefits , but the feeling persists in many quarters that Edward DeBartolo has moved in with a bigger and better offer . Oh well , DeBartolo won ' t be an absentee owner in Cleveland . Ever since DeBartolo was blocked in his effort to purchase the White Sox , stories have emanated from Chicago that the whole thing is bringing about the undoing of Bowie Kuhn , and that several prominent ( good lord , deliver us ) politicians were under consideration for his job . The reports have caused a number of owners to volunteer angry denials in support of the commissioner - from George Steinbrenner , John Fetzer , Bud Selig , etc . " There hasn ' t been one stitch of conversation on the subject and it ' s so far from the truth that it ' s pitiful , " says Selig . The problem isn ' t Kuhn , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . On other ownership situations , everyone who knows new White Sox owner Jerry Reinsdorf speaks of him in the hightest terms , and his will be the first stable ownership the White Sox have had in decades . Sometime this week , Southern California real estate developer George Angyros - who bought the Western White Sox and is turning it into condeminia - will decide if he really wants to buy the destitute Seattle Mariners . . . Speaking of money , Cleveland first baseman Gary Gray is collecting $202 a month unemployment insurance , despite the fact that he made $23,420 ( the 1980 median family income was $19,684 ) for the season and is now playing in Mexico . . . And speaking of Western White ( hats and ) houses , the Cubs are proudly proclaiming that it wasbecause of them that Ronald Reagan got his start in show business . He was in spring training as the club radio announcer and met actress Joy Hodges , who suggested that he get a screen test . - While Oakland has stayed away from free agents , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and scouting director Dick Wienciek has already raised the fulltime scouting staff from 0 to 9 , including Eddie Matthews , Camilio Pascual and Billy Hitchcock . Pascual quit as pitching coach of the Twins ( the position Johnny Podres got ) because Calvin Griffith refused to pay him the players ' minimum , $32,500 . Somehow there is a twisted set of priorities and rewards in the game when coaches can ' t make even the players ' minimum salary . . . The A ' s owners apparently are going to be cautious , as evidenced by the fact that Mike Norris ' contract demands and the fact that he can be a free agent at the end of ' 81 have prompted serious thought to dealing the Cy Young Award runner- up . . .

In Puerto Rico , Ed Figueroa has slipped back again , but the Orioles are raving about the fact that not only is Dennis Martinez throwing harder than ever , but he seems to have settled down and regained his hunger . Add those 275 innings back to that staff , and no one will care if Steve Stone slips to 13-15 wins . . . White Sox manager Tony LaRussa is now working in the Sarasota law firm of Connolly and Dooley . LaRussa knows that the key to that team still comes down to the middle of the infield , right now Todd Cruz at short and Tony Bernazard at second ( although they ' d still like to get Jerry Remy if the Red Sox will entertain dealing him for pitching ) . Cruz in the past has been flashy but erratic . " The one thing that makes me feel he ' ll do the job is that unlike a lot of flashy shortstops who make the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grounder in the ninth with the bases loaded , " says LaRussa , " there were at least a dozen times when the game was on the line in the ninth , the ball got hit to Cruz and he made the play confidently . " Incidentally , LaRussa says he ' s going to bring Ronnie Perry to camp as a nonroster player , mainly on the recommendations of his 1980 manager , Mike Pazik . . . Seattle manager Maury Wills plans 7 p.m. skull sessions every night in spring training , which will go over big . " They do it in football , why not baseball ? " he asks . - Frank Robinson may be in the final list of candidates for the Giants ' job , but the theatrics of inviting him may be another blacksploitation job - as he was offered only a one-year contract , found that all the coaches have already been hired and got no guarantees on the clubhouse problems that resulted in the firing of Dave Bristol . . . The Yankees have asked Luis Tiant to spring training , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roster because it is already filled and they can ' t lop off some prize prospect . Tiant ' s attourney , Paul George , is still negotiating with the Angels and would still like to talk to the Red Sox . . . Signing Rusty Staub as a free agent and re-signing Tom Hausman and Mike Jorgenson may evoke a few laughs from suffering Mets fans , but with the arms the club has on the way the drought may end faster than anyone thinks . " We have seven great arms , " says new player personnel director Lou Gorman , listing Neil Allen , Jeff Reardon , potential star Timothy Leary , Juan Berenguer , Scott Holman , Mike Scott and Tom Thurberg . The latter , a 23- year-old righthanded reliever from Weymouth ( who was once a No. 1 draft choice as an outfielder ) , is expected to begin the season in Tidewater , but if Allen moves into the starting rotation he could move up to join Reardon . . . The settlement of the Mike Marshall grievance simply seems to be a logical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case . Marshall , who claimed that he was released in June because of Players Assn. involvement , was granted 1. , the right to come to spring training with the Twins ( they already had to pay him because his ' 81 salary had been guaranteed ) , and 2. , credit for pension time for all of 1980 in exchange for dropping his unfair labor practices suit . Marshall feels that management was afraid of going before the NLRB with Griffith on the witness stand . " We were just going to let Calvin speak , " said Marshall . " We wouldn ' t interrupt him or anything , and by the time he was done we ' d probably have been awarded the deed to his franchise . " Marshall can choose to shop around with other teams , and Billy Martin indicated some interest on the part of the A ' s . . .
