" To become  --  part of you , " she replied . " To be an Aspect of Fate . I am ready . " " But we must be sure you understand completely , for this is no simple thing . We are three , but we have only one body . If you join us , you will never be alone . " " I have lived too long alone ! " Niobe exclaimed . " Because we are three in one , there is no privacy or separate identity , " Lachesis continued . " No individual rights . Each must do what is needful for the whole , without exception . If , for instance , it is needful to dally with a man  --  " " Oh . You mean  --  my body might have to  --  " " To indulge with my man , " Lachesis finished .

She had never imagined having physical relations with any man other than Cedric and hesitated even to commencesuch imagination . " But what of the spinning of the threads of life ? " " That , too , " Lachesis said . " But you will have no trouble there . A woman is not a single-purpose creature , and most purposes you are already prepared for . Our use of the distaff is merely more sophisticatedthan what you have known before . " And in her hand appeared a glowing distaff , the short staff on which thread or yarn was wrapped . " We have only to keep the skein orderly ; it is the social aspect that can be difficult . " Difficult indeed . The idea of being with another man  --  another woman 's man  --  appalled her . Yet she could see that it did have to be a consequence of joining with other women , when there were not enough bodies to go around . " Suppose  --  I decline ? " " My dear , we do not force anyone to join us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ male Incarnations  --  though of course there is no law about that , only custom  --  but we women are more accommodating . If you elect to remain mortal , you will return to your prior life , and we will select another woman for the exchange . But I confess that we do like you , and not merely for your beauty ; seldom does a mortal person have the courage to approach Thanatos as you did . " " I have no courage ! " Niobe protested . " I had to do it ! " " Oh ? Why ? " " To save my husband , the man I love ! " " And for love you went literally into the fire . If that is not courage , it remains a quality we deeply respect . " " And it was all for nothing ! "  | " Yes , it is an irony . We could not give you what you desired , then , and we offer you some of what you do not desire now . Yet there are compensations . " Niobe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer on the subject of what she had desired ; she had to focus on new things . " Compensations ? " " Immortality  --  as long as you choose . Power  --  as much as you can manage . Purpose  --  for you will spin the ultimate threads of man 's existence . We are Fate . " Niobe thought about returning to her former life  --  without Cedric . Then she thought of immortality , power , and purpose  --  and the opportunity to seek to settle her score with Satan . She would rather have had Cedric , but she really had no choice  --  as Chronos had known . She was destined to accept this role . " How do I join ? " " Take my hand , " Lachesis said , extending it . Niobe took her hand . There was an odd sensation of flux . She felt simultaneous loss and gain . Then she saw that Lachesis had changed to the form of the young , pretty woman who had appeared momentarilyin her Purgatory Abode . Their hands separated . " Farewell , Daphne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " What ? Niobe looked down at herself  --  and discovered she looked like Lachesis . Yes  --  you are with us now , Lachesis said silently to her . Your body has gone to Daphne  --  the former Clotho . Be silent ; your day is coming , while hers is done . Niobe was silent . She watched and listened and felt , while Daphne turned about , verifying her new separateness , then faced them . " Farewell , old friends , " Daphne said , and her own eyes were bright with tears . " And thank you , Niobe . You have given me back my life . " She opened her arms , and Lachesis embraced her ; this time there was no transfer of personality . Tell her she is welcome , Niobe thought , feeling an almost overwhelmingsurge of nostalgia . Her body  --  changed to that other form  --  gone forever ! You tell her , Lachesis replied . Something shifted  --  and Niobe was back in her own form . Except that two other minds were with her . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was , as lovely as ever , standing beside Daphne . Fate had assumed her likeness ! " You are welcome , Daphne , " Niobe said . Then , suddenly , she was crying uncontrollably . Daphne opened her arms to her , and they hugged each other , the tears streaming down both their faces . At last they pulled apart , looked at each other , two comely young women , smiled  --  and burst into tears again . For pity 's sake ! the thirdp62mind in her body grumbled . That was , Niobe realized , Atropos , the oldest Aspect . Eventually Niobe and Daphne ran dry . " I can see you resemble me , " Niobe said tearfully . " I hope you have the very best of lives ahead of you . " " I surely do , " Daphne replied . " Fate pulled a thread . " They had to laugh at that . Then Niobe turned the body back to Lachesis , who turned it into the spider , and they climbed nimbly up the thread to the cabin ceiling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the steamship and into the sky , suddenly cruising with great velocityalong a cable extending across the world . In a moment they slid into their web-home in Purgatory and resumed human form . " You will not need to learn the way things are by yourself , " Lachesissaid . " We will guide you when you need it  --  and routine homelife is mostly my department anyway . But you will need to spin the threads . " First Lachesis introduced her to Atropos . The body assumed the form , and the old woman went to stand before the mirror so that Niobe could see her clearly through their eyes . Atropos was in her sixties physically , with iron-gray hair , deep wrinkles , and an overlargenose ; she looked like anybody 's grandmother . " I lived a routine life on a goat farm , " she said . " I helped my husband milk the goats and I cooked and washed and bore four children  --  one of them died of smallpox when he was eight  --  but my two girls and remaining son grew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out when they made it on their own ; I had , I confess , enjoyed running their lives . So I concentrated on my husband and made him sell the farm  --  the market for goat 's milk was declining as the big cow-dairies got established , though of course their milk could not compare in quality to what we produced  --  and invest the proceeds in a furniture factory . But we had been deceived about its prospects ; it went bankrupt , and we lost our life savings . My husband took sick , got consumption , got pneumonia , and died broken-hearted , and I knew it was my fault ; I should have left well enough alone . But meddling in other people 's lives was alwaysmy predilection , and when Fate came to me and asked whether I wanted a real chance to meddle  --  well , here I am ! I 've been at it fifteen years , and I 'm satisfied . And , I trust , I am not ending people 's lives frivolously . " But does n't Death  --  Thanatos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She could n't talk aloud when she did n't have the body . " Thanatos sees to it that the souls of those who die go to their proper appointments  --  Heaven , Hell , or Purgatory . He must judge the balance of good and evil in each soul , and tend to the difficult cases personally . But I determine when each life shall end ; I cut the threads . "  |p63You  cut the thread of Cedric 's life ? " I had to . He had arranged to take the place of the thread I was supposed to cut short , so I had no choice . I do not have complete autonomy , especially when there are changes in the existing tapestry . I do not act capriciously . I must operate within parameters so that no thread extends beyond its proper position , or ends too soon . Otherwisethe tapestry would be distorted . " But why any thread ? Niobe demanded . Why not let good folk live ? Atropos formed a weary smile . " Child , that is a common fallacy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that everything would be all right if only they could live forever . It 's just not true ; the old must pass that the young may come into being . None of us would exist today if our elders had not made place for us . So each thread of life is given its appropriate term , some being longer than others , and each must end as it begins , according to the pattern of the tapestry . I simply tailor the individual threads for the good of the whole tapestry , facilitating the greatest good . It is not for any single thread to decide its own place in the tapestry ! It would be disaster to live forever ! " What about the Incarnations ? Niobe still felt guilty that she should have such a future reserved for her , while Cedric , the one with the most promise , had been cut short . " The Incarnations are immortal , but not forever , " Atropos explainedpatiently . " We maintain our lives without aging , as long as we hold our offices  --  but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have variable terms . Your predecessor , Daphne , served for twenty-six years , doubling her mortal life  --  until she spied a situation that was too tempting to resist . She found a good man  --  there 's much to be said for a good man !  --  and he needed a good woman he would not otherwise obtain  --  and she simply had to have him . So she has left the office . Now she will age normally , until I or my successor cuts her thread , and she will move on to the Afterlife . Similarly , the other Incarnations change office , all in their own fashions . Thanatos dies when he becomes careless and is slain by his successor ; Chronos assumes office as an adult and lives backward until the hour of his birth or conception  --  I have never quite been certain which  --  " Backward ? This was confirmation of what she had suspected . How can he associate with others ? " When you want to talk , here in the Abode , just take over the mouth , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of others , we maintain separation of identities , but we can relax here at home . But to address your question : Chronos controls time . He can reverse himself in order to converse with others , or he can reverse them to align with him , for brief periods . At any rate , immortality is not per/fection , and we Incarnations do eventually become bored or tired , and so we leave office . Only in mortality can the true guts of existence be experienced . Theoretically one of us might continue forever , but it has never happened , except in the case of God and Satan , and I 'm not entirely sure about Satan . " The old woman seemed to have the answers . Things did seem to make sense  --  but still Niobe could not accept the necessity of her husband 's death . " Would it have hurt the Tapestry so much , " she asked , discovering that she could indeed assume control of the mouth without the rest of the body , when Atropos permitted , " if Cedric had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is my department , Niobe , " she said . " I measure the threads of life , which means I determine their approximate length and placement . I do n't actually weave the tapestry  --  itis far too complex for any individual mind to compass  --  but I set the threads according to the pattern and see that they are properly integrated . Mortals tend to blame Fate for their failings and fail to credit Fate for their successes , which is annoying , but actually my options are limited . The overall pattern is determined by the interactivecompromise between God and Satan  --  the macrocosmic balance between Good and Evil  --  and we other Incarnations simply implement it to the best of our ability . Certainly there would have been no harm if your beloved man had lived ; he was supposed to live . Then we were forced to substitute your thread for his  --  and then to eliminate that too , for you are no longer listed among the mortals , though they are not aware of your departure . Let me show you . " Lachesis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an awesome scene . It was a phenomenal pattern in glowing colors , a Tapestry as wide as the world , with threads in their myriads like stars in the nocturnal welkin , forming a pattern of such marvelous intricacy as to baffle the mind of the beholder . Niobe had never seen a tapestry as magnificent as this ; she simply stared , entranced . " Your thread , and Cedric 's , are approximately here , " Lachesis said , using the distaff to point to one section , which expanded obliginglyto show a better definition . It was like descending to Earth from Purgatory , watching the continents expand until they lost their cohesion , only this was not land but the enormous and splendid Tapestry of human existence . The line of color that Lachesis indicated became a mighty river of threads , and these continued to be magnified until at last the individual threads showed like cables , each in its separate region . " To this side is the future , and to this side the past , " Lachesis continued . " The present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can see , it is moving . " Indeed , the cables seemed to be traveling toward the " Past " side , so that the center drifted steadily toward the future without actuallyp65moving . The Tapestry was like a river flowing by . Niobe had to blink and blink again to avoid being mesmerized  --  but this was futile becauseat this moment Lachesis had the body and control of the eyes . Lachesis indicated two cables in the near past . They converged from different parts of the Tapestry and linked , twining about each other . " Your marriage to Cedric , " Lachesis said . The two continued on , separating a little to show when he went to college , and touching again when she visited him there . There was a sparkle at one point , and Niobe blushed in her mind when she realized that was their first lovemaking , a significant point in their relationship . Then , after a bit , a new thread started , tied in to theirs : Junior 's conception or birth . Then the two major threads exchanged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death  --  in lieu of hers . Finally her thread separated from Junior 's and faded out . It was not cut off ; it just became obscure . Her assumption of the Aspect of Clotho. lts texture changed : Daphne . Niobe 's mortal flesh had not left the world , only her spirit . " So you see , the Tapestry now has one thread where there were two , " Lachesis concluded . " And that one differs . We have tied it in in such a way that no one who does not inspect this region closely will realize that any change occurred . But the Tapestry as a whole is basically unchanged , no cohesion lost . " " But Cedric  --  " " Incarnations do not make policy . We conjecture that Satan anticipatedyour assumption of the Aspect and sought to prevent it . In that he failed  --  but there generally is a cost when one foils the Prince of Evil . " " Then Satan can force mortals out before their time ? " Lachesis sighed . " Niobe , our firmament is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old that neither would interfere with the operations of mortal humanity . The idea is that each soul is given its chance in life , to make of it what it will , and those who prove they deserve to be in Heaven then go there , and those who deserve to be in Hell go there . All of mortal existence is merely the proving ground for the classification of souls , which is one reason why eternal mortal life can not be permitted : it would clog the Tapestry and interfere with its function . But there was one loophole . " Lachesis turned away from the mirror and went to the Abode 's kitchen to fix a meal . Niobe was half afraid that the larder of this spider 's den would contain some huge , juicy fly for consumption , but the food was normal . She realized that Fate , unlike some of the Incarnations , did not have a household staff . As a woman  --  or three women  --  Fate preferred to do for herself . Niobe approved . " God , as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | " Satan , being the Incarnation of Evil , naturally does what is wrong ; he cheats . So Satan is constantly interfering in the affairs of mortals , yanking the threads about , generating no end of mischief . We other Incarnations , who are supposed to be neutral , must thus oppose Satan , just to get our jobs done . So the answer to your question is : Satan should n't take out mortals before their time , but he does . We try to prevent this  --  but your own case is an example of the problems we encounter . It is no easy thing to deal with determined evil , as we all know to our cost . I am sorry ; we would have saved you and your husband if we could , but Satan has agents in the Purgatory Administrationoffice , and he has absolutely no scruples . Your husband 's death is a miscarriage of what was supposed to be  --  but it happened . " And with that Niobe had to be grudgingly satisfied . It strengthened her resolve to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Niobe to get into the routine . She learned how to travel on threads she flung out magically at will so that she could slide quickly to any portion of the globe . These were travel-threads , not the same as the threads of life ; they appeared when needed and vanished when done . She learned how to generate the " Read Only " threads between her fingers for spot checks on individual lives , though she could obtain only a fraction of the definition that Lachesis could ; it was a skill that went with the Aspect and experience . She learned how to change into spider form for special occasions . As Fate , she had an affinity for the web weavers , and no spider would protest her presence in its web or her intrusion onto its hunting ground . In fact , spiderwebs were convenient landing places when she traveled ; she could slip to one much faster as an arachnid , then change to human form for whatever task required her attention . She gained confidence : she might appear to be a weak woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making her invulnerable to any mortal attack . She learned where the Purgatory Administration Building was , and who the key personnel were . These were not Incarnations , but lost souls  --  people whose balance between good and evil was so exactly even that they could not be relegated to either supernatural realm . They seemed like ordinary folk , which of course they were , and quite solid , which they were not . They were really ghosts , able to act only here in Purgatory . And she learned to spin souls . But first she had to fetch the raw stuff of souls , and that was no easy task . " It 's in the Void , " Lachesis explained.  | " The Void ? " " In the beginning , the earth was without form and void . God createdthe world from the stuff of the Void , and reality as we know it came into being . But not all of the Void was used . What remains of it occurs at the edge of Purgatory , and no one can go there except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Not even we two other Aspects of Fate can go there ; we become tuned out . This is the one journey you must make alone . " " But I 'm so new here ! I know so little about any of this ! I ca n't  --  " " There is no one else , " Lachesis said . " Do not be unduly concerned ; it is not a dangerous trip . It is merely a unique one . " She had to do it ; it was a duty of the office . But she dreaded it . Her nightmare visions of what was to happen at the water oak had proved to be well-founded ; now she hesitated to go into any truly challenging situation alone . Lachesis took her to the edge of Purgatory . It looked quite normal and it was  --  but it was the boundary beyond which it was unsafe for any other person to go . " And you and Atropos wo n't be with me , even in my mind ? " Niobe asked uncertainly . She had found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her memory . We will be with you  --  but unconscious , Lachesis replied in thought , for they were no longer at the Abode . It would have seemed strange if any other person overheard her talking to herself . Our minds cannotface the Void . But we know yours can , for Daphne went many times . She told us it became easier each time . " The first , the worst , " Niobe agreed wanly . " And I must seek the heart of it ? " Yes . Only there is the essence pure . Do n't forget to play out the skein . So she could find her way back . This time a temporary , vanishing travel-thread would not do ; she had to be guided by the Thread of Life itself . She certainly would not ignore that detail ! She walked on along the road . If no one could go beyond this point , for whom was the road ? Some do go beyond , Lachesis replied , more faintly . Tolerances differ . But you must go where no other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Some of the other Incarnations . Now Niobe had to strain to pick up the fading thought . Mars , Gaea . . . . It was gone . Niobe walked on , and the road dwindled into a footpath through a dense forest . Evidently the vegetable kingdom did not feel limited !  | " The Incarnation of War , " she murmured . " And of Nature . I wonder what business they have here ? " But there was of course no answer . She was on her own . The forest darkened and the path narrowed until it was a vague ribbon through the gloom . The trees became oppressively large and close , as if seeking to encroach on the path and squeeze whatever was on it . She did not recognize their types ; they were simply walls of rough bark , extending up until the branching foliage closed overhead , sealing off the light . But her eyes adjusted , and she could still see . It was mostly her apprehension that was affected . Nervously , she looked back . Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She was surprised to see that it soon curved out of sight ; she had thought she was going straight . But it was a comfort to know she could not get lost , and she continued to hold the distaff so as to let the thread unwind . It was a thin thread , and she worried about its breaking . But she reminded herself that no one except Atropos could sever the Thread of Life and that there was no one else out here to interfere with it anyway . The path ended ahead . She stopped , dismayed , then realized that , though a sullen tree blocked the way , it was possible to go around it . She squeezed on by  --  and found another tree blocking her off . It was just as if they were stepping in front of her , like aggressive men . A false impression , surely ! She squeezed around that one , too . Becausethe trees took up more volume of space above , they could not stand trunk-to-trunk at ground level . They tried , however . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and their lower branches reached down . But there was always a way through , however tortuous . The trees might try to balk Fate , but could not succeed . Probably this path was so devious because it fitted through the avenue of least resistance , no straighter or broader than it had to be . Then the trees seemed to lose cohesion . They became misshapen , with trunks either swollen or shrunken , and their foliageShe paused to blink and stare . The foliage was wrong ! It was no longer green , but purple , and the individual leaves were formed into the shapes of stars or squares or triangles . How could that be ? Obviously it could be , because it was . She moved on . The forest retreated from the path , the trees becoming stranger yet . Now they were multicolored blobs of wood and brush , and some were floating . Apparently the laws of reality were weakening . The path led her to a slope , and the slope became steep . She walked along the contour , and on her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the brightness of the sun , and on her right the slope continueddown into a valley so deep as to give her vertigo . As shep70proceeded , the slope increased until it was almost vertical  --  but her feet held the . path , which was a level niche cut into the slope . Then the slope above actually passed the vertical , and overhung the path , while that below became undercut , so that the path was no more than a ledge cut into a horrendously leaning cliff . One misstep would send her hurtling down ! Niobe had never been timid about heights or depths , but this daunted her . Still , she saw no reasonable alternative other than to continue on . It was , after all , supposed to be safe , and Lachesis and Atropos , her better two-thirds , would not have sent her to her doom . Their own identities were in similar peril . But what did they really know ? Apparently Daphne had never told them exactly what she had faced here . Maybe it was n't possible to convey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needless alarm . After all , the soul substance had to be gathered , and this was where it was , so there was no choice . She walked on . The slope became more extreme , until the upper wall curved down over the path and the lower wall seemed to curve up under it ; she was walking in a notch or groove cut in the roof of a cave . There was no floor , just cloudy vagueness . Then the upper wall curved down until it was below the path , and the lower seemed to curve above . She was walking in the eye of a pinwheel ! Who could believe geography like this ? At length she emerged from the strange configuration . Ahead was a river  --  no , it was the path , butShe stopped and looked back . Behind her was the vertical pinwheel , its walls spiraling outward from the center , which was her path , and expanding in ever-greater sweeps , until she was unable to trace them with her eye . To the sides was open space , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  well , it started like a path , but continued like a stream . She kept trying to focus on it , but kept not succeeding . One way to find out . She resumed her walk  --  and the path softened . Soon she was sloughing through muck . So she removed her yellow cloak  --  there was no mandatory color-coding , but it seemed that Clotho traditionally wore yellow , Lachesis brown , and Atropos gray  --  and laid it on the path . Then she stepped into it , trying to bring as little mud along as possible . There was no problem ; the mud did not adhere to her shoes at all . It was like soft plastic , slimy and flexible but cohesive , sticking only to itself . She settled down cross-legged , feeling exposed in her underclothing , though there really was n't anyone to see . She set the distaff in her lap , stretched her hands out to either side , and set her fingers in the stuff . She pushed off  --  and the cloak moved slightly forward.  |p71She  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several pushes , the cloak was sliding along well enough . Then the current caught it , and she was floating on down the stream . Her cloak formed into a saucer-shape ; it made a decent if somewhat clumsy boat . She was n't sure why it did n't collapse in on her , but she was n't sure about much else in this region , either . She took hold of her distaff before it could spin out of her lap , and played out the lifeline of thread . The stream carried her by a floating tree , which now seemed more like an island , and on through the starry sky . Perhaps it was a reflection in the water  --  except that the only water was the stream that the path had become . Then the islands became big puffs of nondescript matter , which fell apart into lesser blobs that in turn sundered , until she was in a great cloud of pebbles , and then motes , and then smoke . The smoke dissolved , and she found herself drifting in nothingness . She glanced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almostrun out . But the stream had not yet run its course ; it was carryingher somewhere , which meant that she had not yet gotten where she was going . She could n't stop now , but if she did n't , she would leave her thread behind , and she was pretty certain that would not be expedient . She had to have more thread ! She considered a moment , then dipped her hand over the side and scooped up a handful of substance . It was like thin jelly or thick water . She stretched it between her hands , and it thinned into a taffylike strand . Could she fashion a thread of this ? Why not ; it was part of the stuff of the Void . It might not be pure , but it might do for this temporary purpose . It was awkward doing it barehanded ; she really needed a spinning wheel . Most yarn or thread was spun into fibers , ranging from the half-inch long cotton to the infinitely long silk ; each type required its own special technique . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thread that could then be worked into whatever fabric was required . The essential process in this conversion was spinning  --  which , very simply , was the winding of fibers together so that they became the thread . It could be done by hand , and she knew how to do it . She was , after all , a woman . She had her distaff and spindle , but nothing to card or comb out the fibers . But this stuff of the Void did n't seem to be fiber ; it was more akin to taffy . Presumably she could stretch it out into whatever diameter and length she wanted , and fix it in that form by spinning . She experimented . She stretched some out between her hands , then used the distaff to take up a crude skein . When she had what she wanted , she used the spindle to twist the line , and she wound it fairlyp72tightly on the spindle . The trick was to stretch and twist and coil in just the right manner to produce an even , strong , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had worked before , but Niobe had excellent coordination and experience . If anyone could do it , she could . Indeed she could . Her body looked and felt exactly like the mortal one she had left behind , but she was Clotho now , and had magic . Under her will and guidance the stuff of the void spun into crude thread , and this she spun onto the end of the thread she had brought with her , extending it . Now she could safely continue . At last the cloak drifted to a halt . At least , so she judged ; she had no external reference points , but she no longer had to play out the thread . This , evidently , was the heart of the Void , where she had to collect her month 's supply of soul substance . She had no container , so she used her skill again . She took a handful of the stuff she floated in , and processed it in the way she had the river . This was almost intangible , so she seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But she felt a slight resistance and had faith she was suceeding . Soon she had some crude substance on her distaff : her skein of soul . She did n't know how much she needed , but knew she could come back for more when she ran out . This had not been as bad as it might have been . Now she had to get back . She had drifted to this region , as it was the natural direction ; things always drifted toward entropy . Now she had to go against the current  --  and how was she to do that ? First she tried the obvious  --  and it worked . She hauled on her lifelinethread . She and her makeshift boat moved readily forward as she hauled ; she seemed to have no inertia , no resistance . And she realized now that in the Void inertia was as baseless as matter ; the rules of matter were unformed , here . Her thread was now her only connection to the material frame  --  if it was fair to call Purgatory that  --  so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She had n't needed the thread for finding her way , but for making her way . The floating blobs reappeared , and the river became more evident ; it was a runoff from organized matter , flowing from the organized to the disorganized . She had had to get beyond it , because the river was polluted by some aspects of organization . For new souls , the substancehad to be as pure as she could make it ; Lachesis had stressed that . She reached the mucky portion of the stream , and finally had to get out and slough to the solid path . She was reentering contemporary reality . " Hi , babe . " Niobe jumped . Someone was there , standing in the path , where no person could be !  | " I see you are surprised , sweets , " the figure said . He was hazy in outline , but seemed familiar . " No one  --  can be here , " she faltered . " Except Mars , or Gaea , or  --  " " Or Satan , " the figure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His Nemesis . " Her whole body stiffened . This was the Prince of Evil  --  the one who had arranged for her death ! The one she intended to punish  --  somehow . " I hate you ! " she exclaimed . The figure laughed . " Of course , you phenomenally lovely creature ! I am the Incarnation of all Evil , and hate is far from the least of evils ! Did you realize they have issued a postage stamp in My name ? It says HATE  --  HATE  --  HATE  --  HATE  --  HATE ! Already you are cominginto My bailiwick ! " This gave her pause . It was true ; when she indulged herself in hate , she drew closer to Satan , even though it was Satan she hated . A treacherous situation indeed ! She really could n't afford to hate him . She realized ruefully that Satan had scored against her at the outset . It was his advantage . " What are you doing here ? " " I need to clarify certain matters , sugar , as we shall doubtless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Why do n't you clarify why you killed my husband ! " " That is precisely why I have come here , luscious plum , " Satan said . " It is known to Me that you have some misunderstanding about that matter , and it is not meet for confusion to exist between incar-nations . " " I have no misunderstanding ! You interfered in my life ! " " Not so , sweet rose ! I specialize in evil ; I understand its workings better than any other entity does . Evil is everywhere , to greater or lesser degree , except perhaps in God , who is , frankly , naive in this matter . Let me show you the evil that is in the other Incarnations . " Niobe hurried along the path , poking her distaff forward to move Satan out of the way , but he floated back without moving his legs . He was simply fixed in place in relation to her , like a mirage . She could not escape his attention . " I  --  wo n't listen to this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't evil ! " " Evil is as evil does , love , " Satan said . " From your contaminated thread on , evil lurks in every mortal creature , and it is not necessarily expunged by Incarnation . " " Contaminated thread ! " Niobe exclaimed . " I just fetched it from the purest essence of the Void ! " " Purity does not exist in the Void , delicious thing , " Satan said . " Only chaos . What you have is virtually pure entropy  --  that is , com/plete disorder . When you spin it , you are imposing order  --  your brand of order  --  on the purest chaos you can obtain . That is because you want to define its order completely , with no contamination by order from any other source . But because chaos is complete , it excludes nothing , not even a smidgeon of order . You are necessarily working with imperfect substance , 0 heart 's desire ; in fact it is that contaminationof order that enables you to spin it . Without that , you would not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is only part of it . That substance is a mixture of good , neutral , and evil , and it is impossible to tell which will prevail in the end . Therefore we run it through the ultimate test for its bias : animated free will . " Niobe was trying not to listen , but not succeeding . The voice of Evil was insidiously compelling . " I 'm making this thread for life ! " " Exactly , darling . Animated free will  --  otherwise known as life . By the time each modicum of this soul substance runs its course , the nature of its individual balance between good and evil is known , and final order can be achieved . Eventually the last of the Void will have been processed , and the entropy of the universe will have been reduced to zero . All good will be in Heaven , and all evil in Hell . The job will done , and the system will be shut down . " Niobe was appalled . " All  --  life  --  just a  --  a laboratory to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Beautiful , is n't it ? Just like you , cutie . On that day of final reckoning we shall at last know which is dominant : God or Satan . The score will tell . " " Then what am I doing here ? " she demanded , feeling dizzy . " You are initiating the sequence , honey , " satan said . " You are taking another spoonful of chaos out of the Void . It is a good and necessary task . But evil is in your thread of life ; were it not so , we would not need life at all . " " Well , the Incarnations are n't evil ! " she said stoutly . " You said yourself that this task I 'm doing is good . " " The task is good , to be sure , doll . But the Incarnations are human  --  which is to say , imperfect . They have human ambitions , weaknesses , and lusts . " " Lusts ! " she exclaimed indignantly . " What are you talking about ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They were passing through the pinwheel now , the Incarnation of Evil still drifting before her like a specter , unavoidable . He was becoming clearer , and more eerily familiar . " Indeed the Incarnations do have lusts ! They indulge them on occasion with mortals , but this is problematical . You see , ravishingone , the Incarnations do not age , physically  --  but mortals do . It is difficult for an Incarnation to maintain a relationship with one whop75constantly ages , particularly a romantic connection . So it is better to do it with another of his kind . " It had not occurred to Niobe that that sort of thing existed in Purgatory . Still , Lachesis had mentioned the possible use of the body ; perhaps that was not merely an extreme occasion . She herself retainedher grief for Cedric and her anger at Satan for his connivance in that . She knew from her personal experience already that much of what Satan told her was true : Incarnations did retain human passions . " Unfortunately , scrumptious , " Satan continued relentlessly , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Chronos , Thanatos , and Mars , " Niobe said shortly . " And you . " " Those are the major ones . Some would consider God to be male too , though that really does n't matter . God is indifferent to mortal passions other than power . " " The major Incarnations ? There are others ? " She was still trying to ignore him , but he kept intriguing her curiosity . " Did n't you know , sweet-buns ? There 's Hypnos , who is in charge of sleep , and Eros , in charge of  --  " " Never mind . What 's your point ? " " My point , fair creature , is that there is a severe scarcity of Incarnateyoung flesh . Gaea can of course assume any form she wishes , and she can be a lusty wench indeed , but she lacks one quality that most males prize in a female . " He paused , as if inviting her query  --  and Niobe was hooked . She had to ask . " What quality is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Niobe mulled that over . She could think of only one relatively innocent female in Purgatory : the newest one . Herself . " Surely you do n't mean  --  " " Consider Chronos , beautiful , " Satan said . " He lives backward . He remembers the future , and does n't know the past . Association with a mortal woman is , if you will excuse the expression , hellish for him . They just do n't understand . " " But he can change time to coincide  --  " " For short periods , cutie . Not for long-term . Which means that if he wishes to have a liaison once a week without a hassle , he must find a woman who understands his situation and is willing to accommodatehim . That means another Incarnation . Gaea , or  --  " Again he paused , artfully . " Are you implying that I  --  ? " she demanded indignantly . Again she remembered how solicitous Chronos had been , and how understanding the other Incarnations had been during her first visit . And how closemouthed . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Satan said . " What is to be , has been , for him . " She was becoming outraged . " And you claim he  --  I  --  we  --  that I 'm here because Chronos wants  --  " " And the other Incarnative males , " Satan agreed . " Fate is known as an accommodating woman . But of course those males prefer her youngest and firmest Aspect , as perhaps your better two-thirds have already explained to you . " Niobe could not answer . She had been told . Now that notion was becoming much less theoretical . " You see , honeypot , " Satan continued inexorably , " we Incarnationshave to get along with each other . We are too small a group , and our duties overlap ; if we do not cooperate , the world will revert to chaos and all will be lost . We are not antagonists ; we are the several Aspects of the job . Fate can not operate without Time  --  so it behoovesher to keep him satisfied , and she has one exceedingly potent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " she cried , beginning to believe . " You may verify it very simply , roundheels . Ask Chronos . He remembers . " " No ! " she said . " I love Cedric ! I will never  --  " But she had alreadyagreed when she assumed the office . What had she thoughtlesslygotten herself into ? " Ah , yes , Cedric . Your sacrificial husband , the boy wonder . Allow me to clarify the story on that . " " No ! " she said , turning her face away . But she continued to listen . " The Incarnations  --  and not just Chronos  --  wanted a new face and body and innocence in Purgatory , " he said . " I mean , even the sexiest and most accommodating young woman  --  and Daphne was certainly that !  --  palls after a few years or decades , especially when her body does n't change at all . Especially when her mind gets too knowing . She 's a good one to visit  --  do n't I know !  --  but not to stay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chronically in short supply in Purgatory . So when Clotho found a compatible situation among the mortals , she took it . She was bored out of her gourd , as the saying will one day go , and  --  " " How can you know what a future saying will be ? " " Chronos uses expressions he remembers from the future , and some of them are apt . At any rate , trixie , the Incarnations did an informal survey of mortal flesh , and you were the prettiest innocence they found , and your ability with loom and distaff made it even better . The perfect unliberated , docile sex object ! So they arranged to bring you in . That meant eliminating your man . " This was appalling . She had to deny it  --  yet could not . Satan might be the personification of evil , but he was making sense . Still , shep77tried to fight , weakly . " But it was me they  --  you tried to kill , not Cedric . " " So they told you , cheesecake . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Me . After all , they could hardly have found a better surrogatefor blame ! So that you would agree to join . It does , in that limited sense , have to be voluntary ; you have to think you want it . They have to remove the one you love , to leave you no further reason to remain mortal . They conveyed to your innocent bonnie boy that you were the target , thus very cleverly tricking him into doing exactly what they wanted  --  " " No ! " Niobe cried like a drowning woman . " And it worked perfectly , as you know , trophy-piece . Now the most desirable and innocent morsel of a young woman on Earth is in Purgatory and available for duty . The Incarnations are already champing at the nether bit . I could hardly have done it better Myself  --  butof course such evil is Mine anyway , by definition . I suggest you relax and enjoy it , toots . " " Relax , hell ! " she screamed . Satan smiled . " Exactly . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been slowly clarifyingas they progressed , and now at the verge of the forest he was at last recognizable . He had assumed Cedric 's form . " You utter cad ! " she screamed , trying to push him into a tree . " You have no right to  --  to  --  " He caught her hand . " Shall I kiss you , sweetlips ? " he asked in Cedric 's voice . " I , too , find you desirable , and I can make you forget  --  " She struck at him with the distaff she had been rewinding . He ducked , and the thread sprang out and settled about him in a tangle . " Get out ! Get out ! " she screamed . Satan resumed his normal form , and sighed . " Another time , perhaps , when you have been suitably broken in . " He faded away , leavingher with the tangle . Niobe stood and cried in rage and grief for some time . Damn Satan ! He had changed her promising new existence into a torment of savage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as she could muster . She detached the tangled mass of threads , as they were from the borrowed section of the river , spun the ends together , and resumed her walk . She was not a plaything of Fate ; she had free will , and she could leave this position if she wanted to . They had explained that each Incarnation , except perhaps Chronos , had a trial period in office , after which he or she was granted indefinite tenure if suitable . She would simply declare herself to be unsuitable and return to mortality . Certainly she would not serve in the  --  the capacity they wanted !  |p78She  wended her way through the trees , her tears drying on her face . What a monstrous conspiracy she had fallen into ! To think that Cedric had died in order to make her available forShe was still furious as the forest retreated and thinned , and the path straightened and became a road . She was back in structured reality , now  --  and not one bit pleased . What 's the matter , Clotho @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you hypocrites ! " she flared . She was met by a thought of amazement . Why do you say that ? Niobe let loose a torrent of why . Wait ! Wait ! We ca n't assimilate all that ! We can feel your anger , but you will have to vocalize to clarify the reason . " Cedric ! " Niobe shouted . " You conspired to kill Cedric , so I would  --  would  --  " Her tears started up again , and her emotion was a confusion of love , sorrow , and fury reminiscent of the chaos of the Void she had just departed . Perhaps , she thought in an isolated flash of humor , she had brought the Void with her  --  in her head . Cedric ? We explained about him ! " Well , Satan explained it better ! I 'll not stay in this job ! You had no right to  --  " Satan ! Lachesis ' thought came . That explains it ! Atropos agreed . " Yes , Satan ! " Niobe agreed . " He really understands evil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  " And he told you an intricate lie , Lachesis continued . And you believed him , Atropos concluded . " Yes , I believe him ! " Niobe cried . " And I want to go back to mortality ! At least there my body is my own ! " You believed the Father of Lies , Atropos thought . It is your right to return , Lachesis agreed . But first we must hash this out . You must know the truth before you act , lest Satan lead you to tragedy . " Why should he do that ? " He does not want you in the office . He knows that somehow you will cause him great trouble . That is why he tried to kill you before you could become Clotho . Niobe suffered doubt . Satan had been persuasive  --  but he was the Incarnation of Evil , and certainly he would lie to suit his purposes . She should not believe him without establishing the case thoroughly . " How can I verify this ? " Perhaps Chronos knows . " Chronos ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  " That is a half-truth . " You admit to half of it ? " Niobe demanded.  |p79Lachesis  made a mental sigh . Satan has poisoned your mind . You must cleanse it yourself . Go to Chronos , challenge him . We will be silent until you address us . That , of course , was the answer . Chronos was at the heart of this . She would give him a jagged fragment of her mind ! She returned to the Abode , deposited her new batch of yarn  --  she would reprocess that into much finer thread later , as she spun out the lives of new mortals  --  assuming she remained in office that long  --  and set off along the line that connected to Chronos ' mansion . She was awkward in her use of the travel-thread ; it would have been faster and smoother if one of the other Aspects had handled it , but she needed to master the techniques herself in order toTo what ? Be a good Clotho ? When she had no intention of retaining the position ? Unlikely chance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learned that time reversed when a person entered Chronos ' residence , so that she would actually depart before she arrived . She found that aspect of it intriguing . It existed so that others could converse comfortably with Chronos ; otherwise each would be talking backward at the other . She knocked on the door , and was admitted immediately . Chronos met her , wearing a pure white robe ; he stepped right up , smiling , and took her in his arms and kissed her . Niobe was so surprised that she simply froze for a moment . Then she recovered , jerked back her head , brought up her arm , and slapped him smartly across the cheek . " What kind of nerve do you have , trying a thing like that ? " she cried . He turned her loose , a look of astonishment on his face . " Why , Clotho  --  what happened ? " " What happened ? " she repeated furiously . " You just grabbed me and kissed me ! " " But of course ! As I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done ! " she screamed . " Then it 's true ! " Now a look of realization spread across his countenance . " The time  --  are you just beginning your cycle ? " " My what ? " " Have you just begun your office ? As Clotho ? " " Of course I have , as you well know ! And if you think I  --  " " But I do n't know ! " he protested . " That 's in my future , and you have never said exactly when  --  " Because he lived backward . Now she understood . " You  --  you could n't have conspired to  --  because it has n't happened yet , for you ! " " I would never conspire against you , Clotho , " he said . " I love you . "  |p80She  felt as if a demonic hand had squeezed her heart . She reeled , and sank onto a couch . It was true  --  they were going to have an affair ! This man she did n't know , and certainly did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I did n't realize . You have not done this before . You do n't  --  remember . Had I realized  --  I 'm sorry . I should have known . Long ago you told me the date of your origin . I had forgotten . I apologize for  --  " " What do you remember ? " Niobe asked dully . He took a seat opposite her . " When I assumed my office , thirtyfiveyears hence in your view , I was bewildered by everything . I did not know what to do , or how to do it  --  even the Hourglass was a mystery to me . But you , in your three guises , came to me , and took me in hand , and set me straight . It was as if you had known me all along , though we had never before met . You did so much for me , and I was grateful , and then you  --  " He broke off , putting his face in his hands . " Oh , Clotho ! It 's over at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much and I will miss you so much ! " Suddenly he reminded her of Cedric , as he had been at the outset of their marriage . So forlorn and lost and unable to come to grips with what he knew had to be . She , in her naivete and insensitivity , had only exacerbated his problem . How much she regretted that now ! And the magnitude of Satan 's lie was manifest : Chronos had never , could never conspire . She had initiated their romance  --  thirty-five years hence . And now she was blaming him ! If she had known , at the outset of her marriage to Cedric , what was to be , she would have been far more understanding and careful . Now she faced a roughly similar situation . She did not love this man  --  but neither had she loved Cedric , at first . The lesson was there . Did she really want to return to mortality ? Cedric still would not be there . If she had to live without him , would n't it be better to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , rather than as a simple mortal ? Chances were that this job would offer her many distractions . She could keep herself busy  --  and she could leave whenever she chose to . She did n't have to make a decision yet . YetSatan had tried to talk her into leaving . He would n't have bothered if she were not destined to cause him some grief . Chronos remembered three and a half decades ' association with her . That showed her decision and her future . What point to rail against it ? Better to take herself in hand and do what had to be done . Cedric was dead ; he would never live again . She had to face reality , and the sooner the better . This was her moment of commitment . She did not relish the prospect , but she had to put the past firmly behind her . She dried her face , arranged her hair , and stood . Chronos sat with his face covered . He was not pretending ; he was a decent , vulnerablep81man , and he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was , for him . It was an emotion she understood . She crossed over to him and put one hand on his shoulder . " Chronos , I understand . But this  --  is the last time . " He looked up . " The first  --  for you . " " For me . I do not  --  love you , but  --  " She shrugged . " I misjudged you , Chronos , and I 'm sorry . I  --  I give you this . There is only now , for us . Such as it is . " " Such as it is , " he agreed , lifting his hand to her . She took it . " When next we meet , it will be different . I will not remember  --  this . Or know of it . " " I will not speak of it . " He drew her down to him . She tried to conceal her aversion to being handled by any man not Cedric . She felt guilty and unclean  --  but , perversely , she was sure she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no longer mortal , and she had a job to do here and a role to fill . It turned out that Chronos ' long experience with her future self gave him a special touch , and it became easier to cooperate . When it was done , she dressed and departed , using an exit opposite to the entrance she had used so that there was no chance of encounteringher arriving self . She did not want to try to explain or justify what she had done to that self ! Then , because she also did not wish to return to her web Abode before she had left it , she elected to spend an hour elsewhere . That would allow for the half hour she had spent in Chronos ' mansion , and carry her another half hour beyond . The net effect would be the same as if her half hour within had been composed of normal , forward time . Where would she go in that period ? Where else ! She went to Earth . She slid down a thread  --  this was good practice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walked up to the door and knocked . They were surprised and pleased to see her , with masked concern . " I am only visiting . My other business is not yet done ; I must still leave Junior with you . " She saw relief in them , and it gratified her . They really wanted to keep Junior , and she knew it was n't for the support stipend . This was certainly the place for him . She picked him up and held him and kissed him , then set him down . In a moment he was back playing with Cousin Pace . " That 's a very nice water oak , " the woman remarked . " The dryad came right down to join him when we retreated . ' They were doing it ! At least the dryad was not being deprived . " She is teaching him magic , " she said with a wink . " If he can learn it , he 'll be some magician ! " the man said .  |p82Yes   --  she had done right here . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adapt to this , just as she could adapt to the affair with Chronos . She was a different person , now , with new and different commitments . Even her body was n't her own , but a construct from the flesh of Fate , as if formed from the substance of the Void . But she was no creature of the Void ! She had a new kind of life to live . She hoped it would turn out better than the old one.  |p83Niobe  's life as Clotho settled in comfortably enough , now that she had made the necessary emotional decisions . Each Aspect slept for six or eight hours , and they generally staggered these , so that at any given moment one Aspect would be dominant  --  would have the body  --  and another would be keeping her conscious company , while the third would be tuned out or asleep . For convenience they generallyproceeded from sleep , to company , to dominant , so that an Aspect could be fully alert and ready the moment she took over the body . Thus Niobe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her shift , then assume the office while Atropos slept and Lachesis kept her company . Sometimes they varied it , and special circumstances caused them all to wake or sleep together , but normallythe routine held . Niobe liked the other two . They talked with each other a lot , comparingnotes on experiences and feelings . The other two had eavesdroppedon Niobe 's first engagement with Chronos , for this was as novel to them as to her . They had indeed not conspired to put her in that position ; they had not been having an affair with Chronos . Evidently he , in the progress of his life toward their past , had not been interested in the to-him new Clotho . " But the body is only the body , " Lachesis said philosophically , as Niobe spun her Thread of Life from the supply of yarn she had fetched from the Void . " You are young , you like to think that there is only one man for each woman and one woman for each man , but any combination can occur , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forced to be less romantic and more pragmatic . "  | " Yes , " Niobe agreed sadly . " And Chronos is a good person . But I 'll always love Cedric . " " There is no love like the first , " Lachesis agreed , taking over the lips again . " I remember mine ... " And she recounted her own first romance . It was not as immediate as Niobe 's experience , but it had its own poignancy , and it did show that the older woman understood . Men tended to think in terms of the physical , while woman related to the social ; men focused on bodies and action , while women focused on character and feeling . They agreed that woman 's way was more sensible , but on occasion man 's way had merit , and it was possible for the two to relate . They learned each other 's jobs , to a certain extent . Niobe normally slept while Lachesis measured the threads , but not always , and of course she was alert while Atropos cut them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the threads had to be started , too . So after Lachesis had analyzed , measured , and marked each potential life , on the endless thread Clotho spun , Atropos would cut and place it . The beginning of a cut thread was the conception of a baby ; it had to be tied in to the threads of its parents before moving out onto its own course in the Tapestry . The physical , mental , and emotional qualities of a life were determined by heredity , provided by the parentaltie-in , and its development was influenced considerably by environment . But its circumstance  --  the odd coincidences that governedevery life  --  was arranged by Fate . Some excellently endowed lives were doomed to disappointment and failure , while some seeminglyweak strands were destined for greatness . Lachesis planned these threads with an eye to the esthetics of the larger picture . Some she regretted , as when a thread had to be measured short , meaning that a child would die . But it had to be done , for stresses in the fabric of the Tapestry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of many more innocent threads unless the correction was made in the key region . It would not have been easy to explain to the average mortal why he should suffer , as the stresses were cumulative and subtle ; indeed , there were generally several ways in which a given stress could be alleviated . But it was Lachesis ' job to select a course and implement it , and this she did . Cedric 's early death had not really been Lachesis ' doing . Satan had stretched the fabric in such a way that only the truncation of a specific thread would alleviate it  --  and Niobe had been that thread until Cedric abruptly switched places with her . Lachesis had had to mark it for elimination , and Atropos had had to cut it  --  but that had been in the nature of emergency surgery . They were still adjusting for the distortion in the fabric caused by that unscheduled removal ; it tended to buckle , and several more distant threads had had to bep85cut short , and new ones added elsewhere . Now Niobe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understood how complex the matter of Fate was . Fate was not all-powerful or capricious ; she merely had to accomplish a purpose that mortal man was not properly equipped to appreciate . It would make as much sense for an individual soldier in battle to break ranks and demand of the general why he should be subjected to this danger . But Niobe was no longer a foot soldier . She had become an Aspect of an Incarnation . She was now in a position to grasp the larger picture  --  and to understand just what Satan had done to her . She still had a score to settle with him ! The problem was , she did n't see how . Satan had no Tapestry ; she could not mess up his threads . She concluded that whatever it was that made Satan object to her presence as Clotho had not yet manifestedand that she was on the way to gaining her satisfaction merely by retaining her office . Eventually her chance would come  --  and then she would take it with a will . Meanwhile , she just had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dull . Then the interactions with the other Incarnations , including Satan , became more interesting . Niobe did not love Chronos , but he was so grateful for the particular favors she rendered that it became a kind of pleasure for her . She did have to work with him quite a bit , or rather Lachesis did , for only Chronos could accurately locate the timing of the key events in each life  --  the kinks in each thread . The Tapestry would not be right if the threads were too loose or tight , or crossed each other in the wrong places . It was especially important that Atropos inform Chronos of the precise end of each thread , for Chronos programmed the watch that Thanatos carried . If Thanatos was not present for particular terminations  --  the souls in close balance between good and evil  --  those souls could escape and drift back to the Void , causing the whole effort to be wasted . No one approved of wasted lives . But this , too , became dull . Therefore the Aspects of Fate were wont @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They would merge anonymously with the throngs of people , and pretend to be going home from work , or taking a vacation , or performing some business . People tended not to perceive the Incarnations as such , and to forget them , so it was simple enough to do . Each Aspect had her favorite region of the mortal world to visit . It was a kind of holiday . Lachesis liked to go to special restaurants and enjoy good meals . The Incarnations ' did have natural functions , including the need toeat . If they did not eat , they would not starve , because of their immortality , but they would become increasingly uncomfortable . They had everything provided in Purgatory , but there was something spe/cial about doing it among the mortals . The male Incarnations , Lachesisconfided wickedly , sometimes indulged other appetites with mortalwomen , though they had to be careful not to change the lie of any particular thread . An Incarnation could not sire a baby , because of the freeze on aging  --  a baby would never develop beyond the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affect a mortal . Once Mars had formed a relationship with a mortal Amazon  --  he had a weakness for violent women  --  and her thread had changed its course . This affair superseded one she would otherwise have had with a mortalman that would have generated offspring . Lachesis had had to bail him out ; she had measured that thread but found no way to attach it to start the baby . The necessary interaction had not taken place . She has spoken sharply to Mars about that , requiring him to break off the affair so that the natural order could reassert itself ; then she had tied in the new thread a little farther down the line . Clotho had had to sweeten the pot for Mars until he found a new mortal to dally with . It was a private scandal . Atropos preferred to go to orchestral recitals , operas , and plays . Indeed , she had a reserved box at one prominent playhouse . Niobe got to watch these too , and learned to enjoy them . In this manner she was able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gentleman had challenged Atropos ' credentials ; it seemed they had not been able to verify her social credentials and suspected she was a commonerin disguise . At this point Niobe had taken over the body , smiled , and asked the man what he meant . He blinked , for she was young and beautiful instead of old and homely ; he had apologized for the confusion and departed . Atropos resumed form and watched the opera in peace . Niobe herself went to visit her son . At first she went as she was , but she soon realized that this could not continue . For one thing , she did not age ; she was locked at the physical age of twenty-three , and before long this would be noticed . Also , she did not want Junior to be accustomed to her presence ; it was better that he forget her and orient entirely on his new family . It would be easier on him , in the long run . And  --  it was evident that young Cousin Pacian was smitten by her . This sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of beauty . She deemed it best simply to absent herself . Still , she wanted some personal interaction with her son . So she asked Atropos to pose as a grandmotherly friend who visited relatives in the area and liked children . Atropos , with Niobe 's silent advice , cultivated the lad 's acquaintance , and in time Pace , ever on guard for any threat to his little friend 's welfare , came to accept her also . As the years passed , and Junior became an active child and Pace a tall and surprisingly handsome teenager , Atropos took them to lightp87operas and plays of interest to all ages . Because Atropos had a wide knowledge of the form , she knew which ones were appropriate , and it worked nicely . Both boys enjoyed it , and Pace 's parents looked with favor on it . Atropos herself found this to be a rewarding experience , so it was good all around . But there was one experience that shook them all . It happened when Junior was six years old and Pace eighteen . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went  --  but the old folks soon got separated from the young folks in the press of the throng . Atropos counted as a young folk ; Pace hardly needed supervision , but little Junior did , and anyway they had long been a threesome for such jaunts . They cruised the fair , trying the games of psuedo-skill , eating candy , and riding the small captive sphinx . They watched a magic show that was somewhat faked up to make the magic appear more impressive that it was , and sat through two choruses of the Nymphvs. - Satyrdance . But though it was suggestive , it was n't potent ; the participants were authentic , but in the course of a dozen shows a day they lost their ardor . Nevertheless , little Junior 's eyes almost bugged ; he was n't supposed to be in here , but enforcement was lax and he had promised not to tell the folks . Niobe herself had grave reservations , but Atropos had pooh-poohed them : " The lad 's interested in magic , and this is an aspect of magic . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nymph before . " Of course that was true , because of the hamadryad of the water oak . Then they passed a prophecy booth . " Hey , tell my fortune ! " Junior cried . This was magic , so he liked it . " Ah , it 's probably fake , " Pace protested . " I can verify that , if you wish , " Atropos said . What are you doing ? Niobe thought at her . The fortune-teller will recognize you ! " Very well , let 's test her , " Pace agreed , as he liked to expose humbugs . Junior clapped his hands . So they stopped there , and Atropos paid the seer . The woman looked at her , then proffered the return of the money . " You seek to fool me , immortal one ? " she demanded . " You know I can not read your like ! " " She 's authentic , " Atropos reported , and pushed the money back . " Do it for the two boys ; they are mortal . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Atropos . " I 'm old , but I wo n't actually live forever . " He was n't quite satisfied with that explanation , but let it pass . " Very well . Do us together , me and my little brother here . " He hefted Junior up to sit on the counter . " Who are we going to marry , and will our children be famous ? "  |p88Junior  giggled at the audacity of the question , not believing that the present order would ever change , but the seer took it seriously . " Give me your hands , " she said . She took Junior 's right hand and Pace 's left , and closed her eyes . In a moment they opened again . " Hooh ! " she exclaimed , as if letting off a head of steam . " A most remarkable pair ! " Niobe became more interested . What did the seer see ? " Each to possess the most beautiful woman of her generation , who will bear him the most talented daughter of her type , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tangled skein , and one may marry Death and the other Evil . " She cast loose their hands , seeming shaken . " More I dare not say . " Pace lifted Junior down , and they moved away from the booth . " That was a true telling ? " he asked , awed . " So it seems , " Atropos said . " Of course interpretation changes things , so it may not mean what it seems . " " That prophecy is loaded ! " he exclaimed . " The most beautiful daughter ? " The tangled skein ? Niobe asked . That 's our business ! " And one may marry Death , the other Evil , " Atropos said thoughtfully . " I 'm not sure I like the smell of that . " Niobe had similar doubts . Death is Thanatos , and Evil is Satan . Their daughters will marry Incarnations ? " What 's a tangled skein ? " Junior asked . " Trouble ! " Atropos said . Trouble , Niobe agreed . They settled down under a tree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad prophecy , " Atropos told the boys . " It is no disaster for a man to possess  --  that is , to marry  --  the most beautiful of women , and to have talented offspring . If they stand athwart the skein , that probably means they are to be very important figures . As for marrying Death and Evil  --  well , remember the prophecy says may . Any person may get into trouble if careless ! You have your warning ; you must educate your children to beware of such things as Death and Evil , and there should be no problem . " " Say , yes ! " Pace agreed , brightening . " We have been given warning . We can make it come out all right . " But little Junior , oddly , was more pensive . " Are n't prophecies un  --  un  --  " " Unavoidable , " Atropos finished for him . " Yes , a true prophecy will be fulfilled , and this seems to be a true one . But it does provide leeway . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corr  --  corr  --  " " A corroborative opinion , " Pace finished.  |p89Atro|pos  shrugged . " I suppose it ca n't hurt . " Asking for a corroborative opinion ? Niobe thought . My son is smart ! So they went to another seer . Again Atropos proffered the money , and again the seer did a double take . " What do you do here , you sinister trio ? " she demanded . " It is for the boys , " Atropos said , knowing it had not been the physical three the seer referred to . This was another qualified one ! " Do them together . What is to become of them and their children ? " The seer took the boys ' hands , as had the first one  --  and her eyes also widened . " One to be savior of deer , his child savior of man ; other to love an Incarnation , his child to be one . But the skein is tangled  --  oh ! " The seer tore her hands away . " I can not finish ; it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was shaking . They retreated and discussed this one . " Deer ? " Junior asked . His father sought to enable the deer to shoot back at the hunters , Niobe clarified . So Atropos explained about that , and the boy was satisfied . " I 'm going to do it ! " he exclaimed . " Hama will show me how ! I 'll make the deer shoot back ! " But Pace looked narrowly at Atropos . " How do you know about that ? My cousin Cedric died before you met us . " " I know his wife , Junior 's mother , " Atropos said . " I told you I was a friend of the family . " " Oh ? Where is she now ? She has n't visited us in a long time . " " She is locked into a very special project , " Atropos said . " A secret one . That is why she could n't have Junior with her . " " She 's the most beautiful woman I ever saw , " Pace said dreamily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The Incarnations are human personifications of the important aspectsof existence , " Atropos said carefully . " Love , War , Time  --  " " Death , Evil , " Pace put in . " That other prophecy  --  " " I think , " Atropos said , " your daughters are going to associate with some remarkable figures , and perhaps become  --  " " An Incarnation , " Pace said . " Is that possible ? " " Mortals do become Incarnations on occasion , " Atropos said . " But it is a very rare thing . " " Which one ? " Junior asked . Atropos spread her hands . " As both seers said , it is a tangled skein . I doubt we can unravel it before the event  --  and it may not be wise to try . " " Yes , I think we should stay away from prophecies after this , " Pace said . But Junior did n't seem convinced . They went on to other distractions of the fair , but the boys were pensive , and so was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trace the threads of life  --  but not far into the future , for the vision of the Tapestry soon fuzzed . This was n't because of hostile magic , but because the Tapestry itself was so immensely complex that only direct inspection of its present portion could unravel any of it . But Niobe knew that the threads for both Pace and Junior were of normal length ; neither would die young . After Cedric , she had made sure of that ! But she could not see their precise interactions in the coming Tapestry . These prophecies seemed to confirm that the boys , who were already associating with an Incarnation , would continue to do so . In that sense the outlook was n't as remarkable as it seemed . But obviously there was a great deal destined to occur ! Time moved on , and none of them discussed the prophecies further , but Niobe knew that the boys had not forgotten . From that point on , Junior focused increasingly on magic . He bought a magic kit , and practiced simple conjurations and transformations . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy his age even attempted genuine magic ; it was easier to hire a professional magician , or to buy packaged spells . Junior did seem to have a special talent for imprinting stones ; it seemed the hamadryad had shown him that . He could take a pebble from the shore of a lake and cause it to glow or make a sound . Stonemagicwas a specialty that few did well , and his ability was remarkable in one so young . Niobe bought an intermediate gemstone , a green aquamarine , and had Atropos give it to him for his eighth birthday . He was thrilled , and indeed the quality stone was much more responsiveto his spells than the crude pebbles were . He fashioned it into a homing stone that showed by its glow which way home was , so that he could never get lost . " That boy is going to be a major magician , mark my word , " Atropos said . Pace progressed to other interests , as well as taking over most of the management of the family farm . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair so fair it was almost white . Blanche was a fine person , warm and generous and competent about the farm , but by no stretch could she be termed the most beautiful woman of her generation . Pace gave Atropos a significant glance at the wedding , showing that he remembered the prophecy  --  and had deliberately avoided it . Niobe was uneasy . The prophecy had said " possess " rather than " marry " ; if he did not marry the most beautiful woman , how would he associate with her ? But she kept her misgivings to herself . The following year , when Junior was eleven , Blanche gave birth to a baby girl . From the start , Blenda was dazzling , certainly the prettiest baby in the vicinity . She grew into a stunning child . If Pace had n't married the prettiest woman , he seemed to have fathered her , and in that sense possessed her . Blenda was the talk of the county.  |p91Junior  was now an only child , for Pacian and Blanche lived separately . It was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brother had been much of his family . He knew that his natural father was dead , and his natural mother absent , but his identity was with his cousin 's family . He turned inward , focusing even more on his pursuit of magic . Niobe hated to see him lonely , but could do nothing ; she had given him up , and , anyway , it was the sort of adjustment a person had to make in life . But Atropos seemed to take it harder than Niobe herself did . The old woman had really come to like the boy and missed the threesome adventures . Perhaps by no coincidence , Atropos decided to retire from her Aspect . " I 've had enough of immortality , " she said . Lachesis searched the Tapestry , and located a widowed grandmother who would do . They went to visit her , in the form of Atropos . The woman listened gravely while Atropos explained her nature and her desire . " But if what you say is true , I will become immortal and you will die of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why would you seek such a bargain ? " " It is true that I will not survive long as a mortal , " Atropos agreed . " But I have lived fifteen years beyond my time , and I have no fear of the Afterlife . I know I have done well enough and will see Heaven and I am ready for it . " They showed the woman their other two forms , and she was duly impressed . " Do you mean that I can be young again , and be like that ? I have never seen a woman as beautiful ! " Niobe had the body now . " You can share with me , " she explained . " But I will govern ; you will be an observer , just as I will be an observer when you govern . But after a while we seem to overlap ; we become in effect a single person with alternate forms . In that sense you can become me , if you wish . " The woman shook her head . " I am astonished . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a week , then put her affairs in order and joined Fate . No complexities of meeting were necessary , as this was not a person Satan opposed ; Niobe had been a special case . This time Niobe watched from inside as Lachesis took the woman 's hand , and her essence entered them , while the old Atropos departed . In a moment the Atropos they had known stood before them , a separate person , molded from the flesh of the mortal woman . Again there were tears ; however voluntary the transition was , there was sorrow in it too . They separated . It took time to break in the new Atropos , and to get to know her well . Now Niobe knew what the others had gone through when she had joined . It was n't good or bad , it was mainly a lot of work andp92adjustment , for the personality of the total entity of Fate had made a significant shift . The fascination with opera was gone ; new interests took its place . It was months before they were really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to distract Niobe 's attention from Junior for a while , for she was too busy to visit the mortals on any but a strictly business basis . When Niobe did go to visit Junior again , she had to do it in her own form , for the new Atropos had no interest in this matter . Lachesiswould have helped , but they decided it was better to save her as a reserve , in case it should be necessary to change identity quickly . So Niobe donned a wig and applied makeup to make herself look older . She discovered that the prior Atropos , the one she had known in office , had settled in Ireland , and was now visiting Junior as a mortal . They still enjoyed attending plays together , and she was able to providemagical materials for him that he could not otherwise obtain . They went regularly to visit the hamadryad of the water oak . Niobe considered that situation , and decided to let well enough alone . Atropos really did like the boy , and would see that no harm came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to herself . Then she reconsidered , and visited the old woman privately to repeat the sentimentaloud . " Well , you know my own kin would n't know me anymore , " Atropossaid . " They think I died fifteen years ago . I 'm a grandmother ; I need to practice my art . " Evidently so . But Niobe kissed her anyway . Time passed . Junior grew to adulthood . He specialized in magic when he attended the same college Cedric had , and showed similar brilliance . He progressed beyond the level of his professors . For his Ph.D . project he developed the spell that enabled the deer to shoot back : any missile discharged , whether from bow , gun , or hand , swung around to score in the hunter . Suddenly hunting lost its appeal , not only in the local wetlands , but in all wetlands and most of the remainingwilderness of the world . Similarly developers were balked ; their bulldozers tended to crash back on their starting points , unable to penetrate far into the living wilderness . Junior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industry filed a lawsuit against the college . In the end they had to compromise : the deer-magic would be applied only to those regions officially designated as parks . But the closest one was so designated immediately . Junior had fulfilled his father 's ambition . The hamadryad was so thrilled she gave him a kiss , then hid in the deepest foliage for three days , blushing . Junior became Magician Kaftan , a professional enchanter of stones . His business increased ; soon he was filling orders from all over  |p93the  world . He did not become famous because he maintained a low profile ; the lawsuit against the college had taught him caution . The stones were merely a business to support his continuing researches into magic . He was fast becoming the most formidable magician in the world . Magic was all he cared about , especially after Grandma Atropos passed away . He would disappear into his laboratory and not reappear for days . Concerned , Niobe went to visit him . She wore her wig and makeup , but he recognized her instantly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " She sighed . Her son the Magician was now thirty-four years old , eleven years older than she , physically , and he was a genius in his trade . Perhaps she should not have been surprised ; his father had been brilliant , and Junior had had unique schooling along the way , beginning with the hamadryad . Naturally he had researched his own lineage , and discovered exactly what had happened to his mother . " I am doing well , " she said . " But you , Junior  --  I wish you would not seal yourself off from the world so much . It 's not healthy . " He smiled , prepared to indulge her in small matters . " What would you have me do , Mother ? " " Socialize a little , at least with your friends and relatives ! How long has it been since you visited the water oak ? " " Five years , " he confessed . " And how long since you 've seen Pacian ? " He counted off on his fingers . " A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ married . " " Well , go see them , " she urged . " You owe a lot to the hamadryad , and Pacian is a good man , with a nice family . " She studied him with motherly solicitude . " Speaking of which  --  when are you going to marry ? " " When I encounter the most beautiful woman of her generation , " he said , smiling . " According to the prophecy . " It was evident that he no longer credited the prophecies . Possibly he had researched them , too , using his superior magic , but she doubted it . That was n't his type of magic , and it was difficult for any person to research his own destiny ; paradox closed in rapidly . " Well , all in good time . I want you to visit your cousin , at least , " she said firmly . " He was very good to you . " He nodded , remembering . " He was , indeed . Very well , Mother , I will visit the water oak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " And soon , " she said , and changed into arachnid form and slid up her thread to Purgatory . There was no point in concealing her magic from him anymore.  |p94The  Magician was as good as his word . The following day he phoned Pace , and later that week they had a reunion . In the interim he visited the water oak . The hamadryad was glad to see him , though the passage of years made her diffident . " Mother tells me I should get married , " he said , and she nodded agreement . " But where on Earth will I find a mortal woman as beautiful as you ? " She shrugged and blushed , forgiving him his five years neglect ; even immortals were subject to flattery . At the reunion he met Blenda . He had seen her as a baby and occasionally as a child . Now she was twenty-three , the same age as Niobe 's body , and she was so beautiful she seemed to light the room she entered . It would have taken an expert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was mortal . She smiled shyly at the visiting Magician  --  and worked on him a magic more fundamental than any he had studied . They were married the following year . Niobe attended the wedding , at her son 's request , doing it in her own guise , as no one would recognize her now . After all , she was fifty-eight years old , chronologically ; who would ever believe she could be the mother of the groom ? But Pacian , the father of the bride , gave her a single piercing look , then shrugged , not able to believe the wild thought that had touched his mind . It was a lovely wedding . Niobe sat alone in the crowd , in the section reserved for the groom 's relatives , and cried . When the two exchangedvows , she could hardly contain herself . " I am losing my son ! " she sobbed . More than one head turned to face her , perplexed . Between the wedding and the reception , they posed for pictures . The groom could not present any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belonged to his cousin , the father of the bride . " Indulge me , dear , " he murmured to Blenda , and beckoned to Niobe . She approached uncertainly , stifling tears . " This is a blood relative ; she can pose in lieu . " So Niobe stood beside Blenda and smiled , and Blenda smiled  --  and there was a murmur of awe through the assemblage . " Look at them ! " a woman exclaimed . " Like twins in beauty ! " Niobe realized it was true . She had been said to be the loveliest of her generation , and Blenda of hers . Niobe 's hair was dark amber , like buckwheat honey , while Blenda 's was light amber , like clover honey ; with both , it flowed loose to the slender waist , and both sets of eyes were bright blue . They were a match of feature and figure , like two scintillating gems . It was a remarkable coincidence . The photographers went on to other subjects , and Niobe and Blenda had a moment together . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me who you are ! Kaf said he had a beautiful relative , but I never sus-pected  --  "  |p95Niobe  had of course checked Blenda 's thread of life , and knew she was a fine person all around , as her mother was . She could be trusted , and she deserved to know . " You will find this hard to believe  --  " " After seeing Kaf 's magic , I can believe much ! " " I am his mother . " Blenda 's perfect mouth dropped open . She looked across the room at her new husband , who nodded gravely , though he could not have overheard their dialogue . Then she recovered . " Oh  --  a youth spell ! Of course ! He said his mother was the most  --  but you know that , of course ! " " And his father was as handsome and intelligent as any , " Niobe said , feeling the tears begin again . " Like yours . It is not a youth spell , precisely . I never aged . I became an Incarnation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " An  --  ? " " Fate . " " Fate ! " Blenda 's eyes widened in realization . " Did you ar-range  --  ? " " For my son to marry you ? Not in that manner ! I simply told him to get back in touch with his closest friend , his cousin Pace , and the rest happened . I confess I was n't even thinking of you , but I 'm glad it happened . You are worthy of him , dear , and it does fill the proph-ecy . " " Prophecy ? " " That my son would possess the most beautiful woman of her generation , and have a daughter who would be the most talented of her type and love an Incarnation . " " My father mentioned a prophecy , " Blenda said . " But he said he foiled it . " " Prophecies are hard to foil , " Niobe said . " Certainly it seems to be coming true for my son , and if the rest follows , your daughter will consort with the Incarnation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , horrendous as it may sound . But she is also to be the savior of man and to stand athwart a tangled skein . Since there is an entity who objects to the salvation of man , she could be in danger . " Blenda made a soundless whistle . " I shall do my best to protect her ! In fact , I will consider carefully before I bear her . I thank you for telling me of this prophecy . I had not known the full nature of it . " " No one ever knows the full nature of a prophecy  --  until it is too late . " They ? kissed , then moved on to the reception chamber , where Blenda had to rejoin her husband and cut the monstrous cake . She picked up the knife , and the groom put his hand on hers , and they brought it to the outer layer.  | " Hold ! " the Magician exclaimed . " There is evil here ! " He drew his bride back and brought out a stone . There was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it in a circle . When it approached the cake , it glowed brilliantly . He nodded ; there was the focus of evil . " Go to your parents , " the Magician said tersely . " This may be messy . " " I knew cake was fattening , but . . . " Blenda murmured . She went to join Pacian and Blanche , and the three watched anxiously from one side , while Niobe and other guests watched from the front . What was wrong with that cake ? The Magician brought out another stone and held it carefully before him . Suddenly a beam of light speared out from the stone , into the center of the cake . There was a crackle of scorching frosting . Then the cake exploded . Splotches of icing sprayed out , plastering ceiling , Magician , and guests . Someone screamed . From the cake leaped a demon . The thing had red skin , a barbed tail , and a horrendously horned head . With an inchoate roar it leaped at the Magician  --  and bounced away from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own protection . " So you refuse to die , Kaftan ! " the demon cried , its voice so gutturalthat it was barely comprehensible . " But it takes two to make a child ! " It whirled on Blenda , making a prodigious leap . The Magician threw a stone at his bride . " Catch it ! " he cried . Blenda , almost frozen in terror , moved automatically to catch the stone just before the demon landed . The demon bounced again , for now she had the protection stone . The monster rolled off the side of the invisible sphere  --  and came down on Blanche . Its outsized mouth opened , and its terrible fangs closed on the woman 's throat . Blood spurted . " Mother ! " Blenda shrieked in absolute horror . Then the Magician brought another stone into play . Blue radiance spread from it to encompass the demon  --  and the demon screamed and melted into a bubbling puddle . But it was too late . The bride 's mother was dead . The demon had gotten neither @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terrible mischief in its failure.  |p97Niobe  was an Incarnation , but she could not do anything about the tragedy . She had not thought to check Blanche 's thread . Satan had scored a partial evil again . As it had been when he tried to strike at Niobe herself , he had been balked , but an innocent party had suffered. " 1 should have seen it coming , " Lachesis said with deep regret . " Perhaps I could have rearranged the threads in that part of the Tapestry  --  " " But I 'm the one who cuts the threads , " Atropos said . " I 've been with you long enough-to know  --  " " That thread was cut by your predecessor , " Niobe said . " But I 'm sure I checked it when Pacian married her , and it was of normal length . When Satan strikes , we all make mistakes . No one was supposedto die at that wedding ; Satan interfered by sending his demon to  --  " She shrugged and swallowed , then continued . " And now we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as we have done before . " " Still , it could not have happened if I had n't become careless , " Lachesis said . " When Thanatos gets careless , he gets killed by his successor ; when I get careless , innocent mortals suffer . It is time for me to retire . " Naturally Niobe protested . But they all knew it was true : Lachesis , as the measurer of the threads , should have been alert to Satan 's interference in her measurement . No Incarnation could successfully interfere with another , if the other was on the job . Satan prospered by deceit  --  and Lachesis had been deceived . She had erred.  |p98They  located a suitable prospect , a woman of middling age who had no close family and had a talent for managing things , and approachedher . She agreed , and the change was made . This time Niobe , as the senior remaining Aspect , handled it . She took the woman'shand , and the woman 's essence entered while Lachesis ' essence departed . Again it was done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Unfortunately , the change of Lachesis-identities did not make Fate 's job easier . Satan took this opportunity to yank the threads about to his benefit . Once again it was a struggle to stave off disaster , and once again the staving was not complete . The political scene was constantly in flux across the world , whatevernominal form of government a country had , and Satan was adept at the corruption of politicians . At any given moment , the representation of good and evil in politics was about even , worldwide . Every time an evil power-wielder was ousted , another developed . It was evident that Satan was really trying to gain a clear political advantage that he could use to gain a social advantage . Nowhere was the war between good and evil shown to better advantage than in politics . Quite a number of Niobe 's countrymen had emigrated to America , and now they were achieving political representation there . Whether this was good or bad depended on the particular men , but she tended to favor her own . Thus when , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new Lachesis , she discovered a Satanistic tangle of threads in the Tapestry , involving one of this lineage in America , she investigated . Satan was certainly up to something ; tangles never occurred naturally . But she could not make it out clearly , and Lachesis was as yet too inexperienced to do so . " Someone 's thread is to be prematurely cut , " Atropos said . They zeroed in on it . Sure enough , the thread of a potential future candidate for the American presidency was to be artificially cut . That would seriously distort the Tapestry . But they were n't sure how bad it would be . Niobe consulted with Chronos , who remembered the future . Her affair with him had proceeded intermittently for thirty-five years , and she was really quite fond of him ; he was a decent man . Because the two of them moved temporally opposite , there was always a certain novelty in it , and it was a relationship they found mutually convenient . It was true : it took one Incarnation to truly understand another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " As you know , I have only been in office a year , and I have no knowledge of the world 's future beyond that . " " I did n't know ! " she said , startled . " I  --  I suppose I thought you were eternal , though I 'm sure you told me at the outset . " Indeed ,  |p99now  she remembered the reverse situation , when he had forgotten that her beginning-end was near . It was easy to do , over such a timespan ! " Why , that means we 'll have to be breaking you in , soon ! " He smiled . " You have done that very competently , Clotho ; I will always be in your debt . I hope someday I can repay the favor . " " You did , Chronos , " she reassured him . Lacking the perspective of the future , they could obtain more specificinformation only by going to Earth to check the living threads . There they discovered that a demon had been dispatched from Hell . It would drive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at night and crash into him . Rather , the demon-spirit was to take over the body of a Satanist  --  a Satan worshiper  --  for this mission ; naturally the mortal had not been told that he would probably lose his own life . He merely understood that , in return for assisting Satan , he would be richly rewarded . The old , experienced Lachesis could have twitched the threads expertly to clear the tangle and prevent Satan from interfering . But what would have been simple for her was complex for the new one . It did take time to gain proficiency . They had to take the direct route : a visit to the senator himself . The night the " accident " was scheduled , Niobe took the body and slid a thread to the spiderweb nearest the country house where the senator was having a private party with his workers , volunteers , and friends . There was a lot of liquor going around , and many of the attendees were comely young women . Niobe did n't approve ; if this was one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? But of course a man could not be judged by his private entertainments ; it was his performance in office that counted . Women could not be blamed for being attracted to the focal points of power like bees to flowers ; that was their nature . She herself had not loved Cedric until he had shown his power . At least this made it easy for her to infiltrate ; she was assumed to be a professional of another type . She filled a wineglass with water and carried it about so that no one realized she was not imbibing . She had never imbibed since that night Cedric got sick . She fended off the approaches of interested young men and worked her way to the senator himself . " Senator , your life is in peril , " she murmured as she danced with him . He smiled in that vote-getting way he had . " You are a Russian agent ? " " Just a friend of the status quo . There is a car ready to crash yours . Do not go driving tonight , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was a certain masked malice behind it ; he did not like to have anyone tell him what not to do . Politically he stood for the right things , and more often than not didp100the right things , but that did not make him a perfect man . There was , she had long since learned , a mixture of good and evil in every thread of life  --  which was the point of life , if Satan was to be believed . She had never been satisfied that that was the whole of it , but it was at least a half-truth . So he was annoyed at her warning  --  but she was physically the type of woman the senator did not openly affront . That was why she had approached him in her own form , in a revealing gown . In a moment he would make a pass at her . " You have something better to offer ? " he asked . " Your life , " she replied evenly . " This house is protected ; the assassinwill not enter . It must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; by morning the threat will abate . " For they had ascertained that this particular demon-spirit could not survive away from Hell for more than a few hours . " Remain here  --  with you ? " " No , Senator . I am here merely to warn you , not to entertain you . Heed my warning , and all will be well . " She turned and walked away . When she was out of his sight , she changed to Lachesis , so that the senator could not recognize her , and moved on out of the house . Outside , she shifted to spider form and sat on the branch of a tree , watching . Sure enough , her warning had not sufficed . Once a thread was positioned , it was hard to reposition , and this one was locked in a tangle . The senator emerged with a young woman ; he was going to take her for a ride . He was married , but such men did not take such things too seriously . Niobe , uncertain what to do , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She would just have to go along and hope she could enable him to avoid the assassination . Maybe if he saw the assassincarapproaching , he would take heed and get off the road in time . Of course , then the demon might come after him afoot , but perhaps she could balk it . Certainly she had to try . How she wished that this tangle had n't occurred just now , when Lachesis was inexperienced  --  but of course that was why it had occurred . Satan never passed up a chance ! The senator got into a small car , and the girl took the passenger seat . He drove out the back way , avoiding the guard at the front ; he evidently did n't care to be recognized and have news of this tryst relayed to his wife . The fool ! Niobe knew the assassin was lurking out there , waiting to spy the senator 's car . There would be little chance to escape once that happened . It was difficult to talk while in spider form , but possible . " Senator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the girl to his right . " Yes ? " " What ? " the girl asked . " She did n't speak , " Niobe said . " I spoke . I 'm the spider on your shoulder . " The senator looked left , startled . " What sorcery is this ? " " Just a little shape-changing . I 'm the woman who warned you be-fore . " " The lovely one ! " he said . " I did n't know you were magical ! " " What is this ? " the girl on the other side demanded . " There is a spider talking to me , " the senator explained . " A lovely spider ? I do n't believe it ! " " Take warning ! " Niobe cried . " Get off the road before the assassinspies you ! " Now the senator was doubtful . " I thought it was a ploy for attention . But you disappeared . Now I learn you 're a shape-changer . But why should you care about me ? " " I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " If I did , I 'd probably tell your wife what you 're up to tonight . But you are one of the better men in the bad mess that politics is today and you may have a considerable future , so I do n't want an evil force to take you out . Please , Senator  --  turn about , get back to your party . Save your little dalliance for some other night . " " Now I hear it ! " the girl exclaimed . " How can a spider talk ? " " I 'm not sure , " the senator said , and Niobe knew he meant about the situation , not about talking spiders . That was one of his weaknesses : the inability to make a firm decision on short notice . Normally he had advisers and scriptwriters to put words in his mouth ; perhaps he depended on them too much . When caught unprepared , he could seem positively tongue-tied . " Then play it safe ! " Niobe urged . " The most you can lose is one tryst ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he hedged . " You may be magical , but I do n't really know your motive . There may be danger at the party . " " Then go somewhere else ! " Niobe cried in her tinny spider-voice . " Take a walk through the forest ! Anything but a drive along this road tonight ! " He ground to a decision . " All right  --  I ' 11 check this out . Emjay , you take the wheel . I 'll get out and watch . If there 's an assassin looking for me , he wo n't bother you  --  and I 'll know him if I see him . " He brought out a pair of tinted glasses and put them on as he brought the car to a halt . " But I do n't know the way ! " the girl protested . " Just follow the road ; it dead-ends at the beach . It 's not far ; I 'll catch up with you there , once I 've verified Miss Spider 's story . I want to see what else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you say  --  " the girl said doubtfully . She moved over and took the wheel . She moved slowly on while the senator hid behind the bushes at the side of the road . As the car 's headlights retreated , the senator addressed Niobe . " All right , spider-woman  --  change back to your human form ! You got my attention , all right ! " " I did n't come here to  --  " Niobe protested . " Change  --  or I 'll squish you where you sit ! " He brought up his open hand and made as if to slap his shoulder . Niobe hastily changed . It was n't that she was vulnerable in arachnid form ; she was protected by the same web-ambiance that kept her safe when in human form , no matter how exposed she might seem . Thanatos and Chronos had their cloaks ; she had her web . But she did n't want to tell the senator her true nature , so she obeyed his demand . She leaped off his shoulder and landed in her own form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said , reaching for her . She skipped away . " Senator , if you think this was all a device to get you alone out here  --  should n't you be afraid it 's a trap ? " " Nope . " He tapped his glasses . " These show evil . There 's hardly any evil in you ; you 're just as lovely through these lenses as you are without them . " " Well , I 'm not evil , but also not  --  " She broke off , hearing something . He heard it too . He crouched behind the bushes , peering down the road . The car came slowly from the direction the girl had gone . Its glass was reflective in the night , but the motor had an ugly sound . The senator stared  --  and gave a stifled gasp . Niobe put a hand on his shoulder , cautioning him to silence . The car passed . The senator faced her , removing the glasses , his eyes round in the moonlight . " That thing in the car  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man possessed by an evil spirit , " Niobe agreed . " Now you know . " " If I 'd been out there  --  " " It would have spotted you , accelerated , and deliberately rammed you . It does n't care if it dies ; it 's already dead , though the living man it possesses is n't . " He glanced down the road . " Will it go after Emjay ? " he asked , worried . " It should n't . It 's targeted for just one person : you . " " I 'll go after her anyway , " he decided . " I do n't want her out here while that thing 's on the road ! " He started down the road at a lumberingrun.  |p103Niobe  paced him . " It 's not safe for you afoot either , Senator ! That demon will be back , and  --  " " I 'll hide when it comes ! " he puffed , slowing to a walk ; he was in no condition to run the whole way . The assassin car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bushes . Demon-possessed people were not very alert or observant because it took most of the demon 's energy to operate the host 's body , so the thing never even looked to the sides . It would have worked better if the demon-spirit merely rode along in the body , letting the living person follow instructions  --  but when the instructions included a suicide collision , that was not feasible . The demon had to retain completecontrol so that there would be no last-moment balking . That was probably why it was n't destined to survive long ; it took a great deal of spiritual energy to translate into physical energy . Why had n't Satan sent a full physical demon , as he had to the Magician 's wedding ? Probably because that was very awkward to do . True demons were confined to Hell , and only on very rare occasionscould they be sprung loose . The mortal plane was a hostile environment for demons , as it was for angels . It was easier to spring demon-spirits , as in this case  --  but they were less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the scene personally ; he had forgotten the score Niobe had to settle with him . They reached a bridge that crossed a minor inlet of the sea , and stopped , appalled . The wooden guardrail had been smashed . Obviouslythe car had gone off the bridge and into the water . " She did n't know the road ! " the senator exclaimed . " See  --  the bridge curves , and she was going straight  --  " He ripped off his jacket and kicked off his shoes . He dived into the water , searching for the car . In a moment he surfaced , gasping . " It 's down there ! " He dived again , and surfaced again . " I ca n't get it open ! " Niobe sent a magic thread down and slid along it , impervious to the water . But in this mode she could only observe , not act on anythingphysical . She saw the car , and the girl inside . She returned to the shore . " She 's dead , " she reported . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the house . " Then , sick at heart , she retreated to Purgatory . Satan himself awaited her there . " So you sought to interfere , sugarplum , " he said . " Well , you did not succeed . " " I saved his life ! " Niobe retorted angrily . " And exchanged it for that of an innocent girl , " he countered . " And My purpose has been served . I do n't care whether that man lives or dies ; I just want him finished politically . That has been ac-complished. "  |p104Niobe  brushed on by , refusing to speak to him again . But the followingevents proved Satan correct . The senator put out the story that he had been driving the girl back to town , and had taken a wrong turn and blundered into the bay ; he had fought free of the car but she had n't . Some believed that ; some did not ; after all , his bulk was twice that of the girl . How could he have been more agile in escape than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been perhaps the leading candidate of his party for president ; after the scandal of the girl 's strange death , he could not come close to nomination . He continued as senator , but he would never be president . His career had been capped . All because he had let the girl drive an unfamiliar road alone . " If I had n't been inept with the threads ... " Lachesis said . " It takes many years of experience to foil Satan , " Niobe said grimly . " He is an infinitely wily and indefatigable opponent . We thought it was the senator 's life Satan wanted , not merely his career . It was probably too late to undo the damage when we became aware of the tangle . " But her rage at Satan was renewed . So many times she had tried to foil him and had taken her losses , as it had been with Cedric , with Blanche , and now with the senator . She wished she could skunk Satan completely . But the person of goodwill seemed always to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was Evil Incarnate . Chronos ' time was growing short . He became less confident as he approached the moment of his changeover . For him it was the assumptionof his office ; for the others , it was the termination of it . Each Chronos officeholder took the Hourglass , the single most potent magical instrument in existence , after a mortal existence . In this respectthat office was similar to the others . But from that moment Chronos lived backward until the moment of his origin , when he had to pass the Glass on to his predecessor . It was an exceedingly awkwardadjustment . Niobe had always been  --  would always be  --  closest to Chronos , and now it was especially important . Physically he was twice her age , but in other respects he was much younger . There was now a kind of desperation in their lovemaking , as if he needed reassurance that some things remained as they had been in his mortal life . He could change time itself , but lacked experience , and that made him highly insecure . Finally it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because she had had the foresight to ask him , as if playfully , how many times they had done it , and then she had kept count . Now he was obviously smitten by her , but afraid to confess it , and unable to get a proper grip onp105his job while this impasse remained . She seduced him gently , letting him know it was all right , that she understood . Indeed she did ! In her mortal life , so long ago , she would have been appalled to see herself now . But she was thirty-six years wiser now , and she knew Chronos better than he could believe at this stage . He was an old friend , and though she never had loved him , she regretted no part of their relationship . Satan , of course , called her a call girl , but it was a calling that had its self-respect . The understanding she brought to Chronos was important , yet she missed the true love she had once had , so briefly , as a mortal . The affair was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at last to Chronos ' last/first day in his office . He was so bewildered she knew she had to take him literally in hand , leading him to his mansion where she could explain things more comfortably . Away from the mansion their times were reversed , making communication difficult , for now he had not yet learned how to use the Hourglass to control time . She had to use printed signboards to tell him how to reverse himself long enough for her to take him in hand , for the print was comprehensible whether a person was traveling forward or backward in time . The place was near an amusement park , where he was standing , bewildered . She knew , from what he had told her before , that this was an hour after his assumption of the office ; he had blundered out of the park by himself , and wished she had found him earlier . But now she understood why she had not ( would not ) : she needed that hour to orient him . So her printed sign told him how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , he was suddenly moving forward in time again , and they could talk . Once they were in his mansion they were still together  --  but now she was reversed , not he . The half hour of his reversal canceled the half hour of hers , so that she emerged at the same time as she had started the dialogue  --  a convenience she had carefully arranged . Chronos now understood enough to continue , and was in the hands of the loyal staff of the mansion ; she knew it would work out , however haltingly , because she remembered that it had . Now she had to get on with the other part of it : seeing the new Chronos in . Chronos was too important to her job to be left to chance , as it were ; she had to know exactly what she had to deal with . She returned to the amusement park and explored the situation . She picked up a few minutes after she had intercepted Chronos with her printed signs , before . This time she concealed herself from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too inexperienced to handle this , and it was Atropos ' off-shift . She concealed her face somewhat with a kerchief , so that Chronos would n't recognize her if he saw her  --  not that he had any notion of her identity or naturep106at this point . He had n't met her yet . She followed him as he meanderedbackward into the park . No one else paid him attention ; mortals seldom noticed Incarnations , and the backward-living Chronos was difficult to relate to . So though they were in a crowd , it was in effect just the two of them , playing a kind of hide-and-seek . She felt sorry for him , seeing him so confused and ill at ease . She knew what he was feeling , because he had told her about it . She knew him better than any other person did , now , and better than any other person would . Thirty-six years as associates and lovers did make for mutual understanding . Perhaps it would have been better if she had loved him , for certainly he had loved her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for one of them to be objective ; that had enabled her to cope with the backward nature of their association , and not to take misunderstandings too seriously . She remembered when they had agreed to try the act of love in their natural states , moving in opposite temporal directions . They had had to coordinate it carefully , before and after . It had turned out to be possible and intriguing as a novelty  --  but , for her , not really much different from the normal act , because she had been only slightly aroused . She had simply been there for him , and for her own curiosity . So it had been a disappointment  --  butnow she remembered it clearly , for what reason she was not sure , as she watched him wandering backward through the crowd . Perhaps , she thought , this was an analogy of the human condition : each person blundering along in his own course , trying to relate to others , and succeeding only fractionally . Because each person , mortal and immortal , was traveling along his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfectly , however much they all tried . Finally he backed into the horror house . She followed . Neither of them bought tickets , as the park proprietors were no more aware of them than the other mortals were . It was not a matter of invisibility , just of not being noticed . There , too , she thought , was an analogy of mortality : the key forces that governed the lives of people were generallyunobserved by those who were most concerned . The horror house was stocked with ghosts who floated out periodically , made faces , and yelled " B0000 ! " supposedly scaring the paying customers . Only the smallest children were actually frightened ; the others knew that ghosts were insubstantial and therefore harmless . Still , it was fun , in the sense that playing the rigged gambling games was fun . The illusion of fear and potential riches was what this sort of park was all about . Niobe paused beside a ghost . " But what do you get out of it ? " she asked . " Do n't you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Well , it does get dull , and it is stupid , and it contributes to the prejudice people have against ghosts , but the pay is good , " the ghost replied . " A ghost ca n't get a job just anywhere , you know . " " But what use do you have for money ? " " Well , it 's like this , " the ghost said , clarifying into the semblance of a woman . " I was on my way to work , when I was alive , and I was late , so I cut through this alley . I knew I should n't have , but I 'd been late twice before that month , and I was on notice ; I just had to get there on time . Suddenly a masked man jumped out at me . I screamed and ran , but he chased me down , held a knife to my face , and raped me . I was screaming all the time , but no one came to help me  --  and there were others in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Finally  --  too late  --  I got mad , and I grabbed his hand and bit it . The last thing I remember is his knife coming down at my neck . " " Ah , yes , " Niobe said . This was much more of an answer than she had sought . " By the time I recovered consciousness , I was dead , " the ghost continued . " I guess it took me a few minutes to die , while I was unconscious . There was my body , naked from the waist down , and my throat was a mass of blood , and the rapist was gone . Well , I did n't exactly take kindly to that . So I stayed around , determined to find out who had done it and make him pay . But that takes money , because private eyes do n't work for nothing , so here I am , earning money . Pretty soon I 'll have enough to hire one for a day , and if that does n't do it , I 'll keep working until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When you get down to it , geeking is n't so bad . " She paused to jump out at another child , screaming " B000 ! " The child eeked and giggled , pleased , and went on . " I wish you luck and fortune , " Niobe said . " Say  --  how is it you see me as a person ? " the ghost asked . " I mean , most of the living folk do n't  --  " " You are a person , " Niobe said . " I spun your thread myself . I 'm sorry it was cut short . " " Oh  --  you 're Fate ! I did n't recognize you ! " " Few do , " Niobe said , and proceeded on after Chronos , who had backed up the passage . Why , she wondered , had Chronos chosen to make the change here ? It was the next Chronos who had done it , the one coming from the future . He had not been bound to the site of birth , just to his moment of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his successor had to come to it and take the Hourglass . Exactly how the successor knew where to come she was not sure ; apparently there was a guidance in these things , and not the normal guidance of Fate . Lachesis had , of course , measured his mortal thread , but when that person becamep108Chronos , that deleted the thread from the Tapestry as if it were an unscheduled demise . Chronos  --  the one she had known so long  --  had remarked that his mortal existence had seemed pointless and dull  --  jejune was the actual term he had used  --  so that when the opportunitycame to become an Incarnation , he had taken it . But he had n't realized that it meant living backward , or battling Satan . Well , she was about to learn about the future Chronos . She watched from a cranny of the horror house as the Chronos she knew backed to a dark chamber illuminated only by the glow of the Hourglass . From the far side another figure came , walking forward . The other Chronos ! No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell by the way he moved . He walked forward , and the other walked backward , and they met in the center of the chamber . The Hourglass flared . Suddenly , in the glow of the Glass , there were three : two young women and a child ! Of all times for horror-house customers to pass through ! But the women looked oddly familiar . Niobe saw one in silhouette as she turned : wasp-waisted , hair flowingShe stifled an exclamation . It was her double ! The double walked right toward her . " Come with me , Niobe , " she said . " I 'll explain . " She took Niobe 's hand . Bemused , Niobe suffered herself to be led out of the dark chamber , leaving the other women and the child behind . What was happening ? Out in the light of day , her double turned to her with a smile . " I am yourself , two hours later , " she explained . " You remember how you double up when you spend an hour in Chronos ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " There are three of you then , " the other continued . " Self One is the one approaching the mansion ; Self Two is the one within it , living temporarily backward ; and Self Three is the one living forward again , after emerging . You have always avoided each other before . " " Um , yes . But  --  " " Right now you are Self One . I am Self Three . Self Two is with Chronos , living backward . " " But this is not his mansion ! " " He reversed us for an hour . He wanted company to see him out . He 's only a child , after all . " " The  --  child I just saw ? " " Chronos can be any age or sex , as can any Incarnation , " Self Three reminded her . " He 'll tell you about it , as he told me . I 'm just making sure you understand the situation . " Niobe took a deep breath . " I  --  think so . But who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One ? I mean , if we are all parts of the same person  --  "  | " Self Three explained then , of course . " " But you are Self Three ! " " I am now . Then I was n't . I was you . " " But  --  " The other laughed . " Do n't try to analyze it , self-sister ! You 'll lose your mind . There really are n't three of us , just one in three consecutiveroles . Remember , Chronos is immune from paradox , and so are we when we interact with him . " Niobe nodded , though she felt dizzy . " Now I know how Chronos felt when he started in office , just a few minutes ago . It 's almost too much to grasp ! " " I know . But it 's hard for the other Chronos , too . He 's afraid . So be kind to him ; it wo n't hurt you . I 'm in a position to know . " Then they both laughed ; they were by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reminisced for the rest of the hour , finding themselvescompatible . " We 'll have to do this again some time ! " Self Three said , and Niobe agreed . " Next time we spend time in Chronos ' mansion  --  which I do n't think will be for lovemaking  --  you come early , and I 'll wait for you . " " Agreed . " They shook hands . Then , as the moment drew near , they returned to the chamber . " We must part , " Self Three said , hugging her . She was a very huggableperson . " It 's been nice talking with you . " " Yes , " Niobe agreed . She saw tears on the other 's cheeks . In all the years she had been Clotho , shd had never done this before . Now she realized what she had been missing . Niobe entered the chamber , hesitated , turned  --  and Self Three waved her on . So she walked to the center , where the child stood with the other woman . " Hello , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then Self Two suddenly stepped backward into Niobe . There was a mild jolt , and Niobe stumbled forward . " Hello , " Niobe said. " , olleH " the other replied . But the other was backing away . " I guess you know I reversed you , Obe , " the child said . Startled , she looked at him . He was about eight years old , withtousled sunbleached hair and eyes as blue as her own . He was indeedChronos , for he carried the glowing Hourglass . " Yes , " she agreed . " You  --  want company . For  --  the change . " " I 've never died before , " he confided . " I just did n't want to do it alone . " Niobe glanced about , seeing Self Three escorting Self One out  --  or rather in , as they were moving backward . She was Self Two , now .  |p110She  had exchanged greetings with her other self , coming and going . To each , it had seemed that the other had spoken second , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job to do . " It 's not death , " she said reassuringly . " It 's the same thing , for me , " he said . " I 'll be in Heaven  --  or Hell . " Niobe shifted to Lachesis , who checked her threads . His was obscurelylooped back on itself , but seemed otherwise unsullied . " Heaven , I 'm sure . " She changed back . There were two chairs by the wall . " I hope , " he said as they sat . " I know I should n't worry , but I 'm just a kid . I 'm scared ! " Then his eyes brimmed over , and he was crying . Niobe reached across and pulled him in to her bosom . She had never in her life been able to resist a person who required comforting , and she understood tears about as well as anyone could . " Of course you are , dear , of course you are ! " she said soothingly . " Not one of us is sanguine about  --  that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold him , much as she had held his successor . There were times when men of any age needed the special favor of a woman 's embrace . It was too bad that people of either sex tended to confuse this with sex . " You know , Obe , " he said , " when you came in , three years ago I guess it was , maybe two , I was mad ; I liked Lisa . But when I got to know you , I liked you even better . You 're prettier . " Lisa , evidently , was her successor  --  two or three years hence . Niobe stifled her shock . She had had no idea her own term was ending . " Beauty is no indication of merit , " she said . " I 'm sure Lisa was a fine woman . " " Oh , sure . And when she got mad at me , she 'd tease me with that gibberish language of hers . But you  --  " Niobe changed the subject . " How did you come to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glowing Hourglass which floated before them . He had set it there when he started crying , and it remained . " Oh , you know . " He straightened up , shrugging . " I do n't know , " she reminded him . " I was n't there , remember ? Lisa was . " " Oh , yeah . Well , the Glass was going to be changed , but the guy coming for it chickened out . " He smiled toothily . " He saw it , and he ran ! He just got the hoorah out of there . I was playing in the park , and I just knew someone had to take it , so I just stepped up and grabbed . I was too young to know any better . And here I am , eight years after . Before , I mean . " " I 'm surprised you were able to handle the job , " she murmured . " Aw , Maw Cheese showed me how . I got the hang . "  | " Maw Cheese ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh . Lachesis . The accent was properly on the first syllable , and the ch was hard : LAK-e-sis . But obviously the child did n't take names seriously . Maw Cheese ! Lachesis snorted mentally . This whip-persnapper- " But I always liked you best , Obe , after Lisa went , though Attaposeis okay too . If I coulda growed up , I'da married you . " " Immortality does have its liabilities , " Niobe said , smiling . And so they talked , and Chronos was comforted , and as the hour ended he was ready for the Afterlife . In the final minute he lifted the Hourglass , and Niobe bent to kiss him , and backed off . As the Hourglasswas taken by the shadowy other Chronos , the spell of reversal left her , and she moved foward again . Quickly she intercepted the confused Self One . " Come with me , Niobe , I 'll explain . " She led the woman out before their presence could interfere with the backward dialogue of Self Two and the juvenileChronos . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and went on to clarify the situation . Her prior self was duly impressed . It was fun , now that she knew what she was doing . In due course she guided her other self back into the chamber , and waved her on when she hesitated . She watched as Self One and Self Two merged  --  and suddenly they were both gone . There was only the child Chronos , waiting nervously for his company . How had he known she would come to him and agree to be reversed for that hour ? Obviously she had told him she would do it when the time came . Nevertheless , it was a good thing that Chronos was immuneto paradox ! She departed quietly . She had had enough of this scene ; it was time to get back to her regular business . One thing stayed in her mind , though . Three years  --  or two  --  until she left her office ! To be replaced by Lisa.  |p112From  time to time Niobe checked on her mortal family . The rawness of the tragedy of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be quite happy with his bride Blenda . She was a schoolteacher , disdaining to exploit her beauty by going into show business . Blenda visited her father , Pacian , often , making sure he took care of himself during his bereavement . It was her bereavement too , but she used a spellstone her husband provided to damp its misery . This was not , Niobe knew , from any selfishness . It was simply that , with a husband and a father to attend to , and a class to teach , she could not afford to be incapacitated at this time . This was one of the benefits of modernmagic ; it did make it easier for people to survive such crises . Perhaps it was for similar reasons Blenda postponed starting her own family . But Pacian was not doing as well . He refused to use magic to amelioratehis misery , and his suffering did not appear to ease with time . He maintained himself with solemn dignity , meeting his commitments , keeping up his health , but he seemed to be aging too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Magician whom Satan had sought to strike down , she felt a guilty responsibility for the tragedy of the wedding . Also , as an Aspect of Fate , she knew she should have been able to balk Satan more effectively than she had . So it was at least in part her fault . Pacian had been her son 's best friend in youth , virtually his brother ; it was not right to let him suffer . She visited him in her own form and apologized . At first he hardly listened , but then he remembered . " You  --  you are the Magician 's relative ! The one who posed with my daughter . "  |p113Niobe  wrestled briefly with her sense of propriety and decided it did n't matter . " I am related to the Magician , " she reminded him . " Closely . " " He has no little sister , " he said . " I am his only cousin , onceremoved , so you can not be related that way . Yet you are strangely familiar . Exactly how are you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before the plunge . " You have met me before . " " I 'm sure I have  --  or someone like you . It nags me every time I see you ! But I ca n't place the connection . " " Certainly you can . I am the Magician 's mother . " He laughed . " Sure , and you 're sixty years old ! " " Closer to sixty-two . " " I knew his mother when I was a boy . She was the prettiest woman extant ! But after she left Junior with us , she visited for a while , then disappeared . She had some kind of important job that took all her time . I think she just could n't stand to stay around where cousin Cedric had died . " Suddenly his animation deflated . " I know the feel-ing . " " I am Niobe Kaftan , " she said firmly . " What you say is true ; I could not remain . I loved my baby son , but I knew I could not raise him as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I have never truly regretted that decision ; your folks did a fine job with him  --  and with you . " " He was always a good boy , " he agreed . " I was so pleased when he took an interest in my daughter . Of course they are second cousins , but it reunified a family that had been drifting apart . " Then he refocusedon her . " The irony is that you do resemble her . But you are no older than my daughter . " " I never aged , physically , " Niobe explained . " I am still the physicalage I was when you were twelve . When I kissed you and de-parted . " " That kiss ... " he murmured , remembering . But he was still unable to accept it . Blenda , being younger , had readily acclimatized to the truth and kept her mouth shut , but Pacian at age fifty was too adult to swallow the impossible readily . " The Magician , perhaps , has a spell for eternal youth  --  but he has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it in time for his mother 's use . " " I became an Aspect of Fate , " she said . " An Incarnation . They are physically frozen ; they are Incarnations of Immortality  --  for a while . So , as Clotho , I never aged . " He looked at her again . " You are beautiful , " he said as if yielding a point . " Probably as lovely as she was . I had a crush on her  --  " " I know . "  |p114He  sighed . " Very well . I will entertain the notion that you are she , unaged . I 'm sure the matter can be verified readily enough ; the Magicianwill know . " " He does . " " But I require proof of my own . As I recall , Fate has three As-pects  --  " " Yes . I assumed the Aspect of Atropos to continue visiting Junior  --  andyou . " " Atropos ? " " The oldest Aspect of Fate . She  --  " " You can change just like that ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave the body to Atropos . Pacian shook his head . " No , you are not she . " " Of course I 'm not , " Atropos said . " The Atropos you knew retiredto be with you and the boy until she died ; I am her successor . " She gave the body back to Niobe . " And you were there , too , in the body  --  all the time ? " " Yes , " Niobe said . " There is something that happened  --  " " The prophecy . " " Which I voided . I married Blanche . She was the finest wom-an  --  " " But not the loveliest of her generation , " Niobe finished . " Correct . You were that . " She laughed . " So I have been told . And Blenda is the one of her generation . She honored the prophecy by marrying  --  " She broke off , suddenly making a connection . She stared at Pacian . He stared back with similar astonishment . Then he turned away . Niobe got up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Niobe tried to concentrate on her spinning , but the others would n't let her . " I was n't there , " Atropos said . " But what 's wrong with Pacian ? " " He 's my husband 's cousin ! " Niobe retorted . " Your husband died almost forty years ago , did n't he ? " Lachesis asked . " And Pacian 's wife four years ago . You are both free , now . " But we never thought of each other in that way ! " " But he had a crush  --  " Lachesis said . " And you are the most beautiful  --  " Atropos put in . " To Hell with the prophecy ! " Niobe cried . " That is what Satan would like , " Lachesis said snidely . " To Hell with Satan ! " " Exactly how did that prophecy go ? "  | " Each boy would possess the most beautiful woman of her generation , " Niobe said , concentrating to remember it accurately . " Each would bear a most talented daughter . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become one . No , wait  --  there were two prophecies ; I 've got them mixed . " " That 's all right , " Lachesis said . " Remember all you can . " " Both would stand athwart the tangled skein , " Niobe said . " That 's us ! " Atropos said . " One may marry Death , the other Evil , " Niobe said , fishing anotherfillip from her memory . " One to be the savior of man  --  the daughter of the savior of deer . I think that 's all of it . " " Then it 's the Magician 's daughter who will save man , " Lachesis said . " But he has no daughter , " Atropos pointed out . " And Pacian 's daughter certainly did n't marry Thanatos or Satan ! " Niobe said . " So it remains a mishmash ; it does n't  --  " " Unless you marry Pacian , " Lachesis said . " And give him another daughter . " " That 's preposterous ! " " You are leaving us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be a fine way to do it . " " You damned matchmaker ! I do n't love Pacian ! " " Yet , " both other Aspects said together with her mouth . It was a month before Niobe could bring herself to face Pacian again . He looked at her with a certain resignation . " Prophecies are difficult to void , " he said . " And often not understood until too late , " Niobe answered . It was a familiar dialogue . " I want you to understand that I never  --  " " Of course . I 'm over sixty years old . " " And you look younger than my daughter . In addition , your love was Cedric , mine Blanche . I am sure you would not wish to be untrue to your love any more than I would to mine . So we really should dispense with this foolishness  --  " Untrue to her love . Niobe sighed . She had been physically untrue to Cedric a thousand times ! Yet that had provided her with a better perspective . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , after Cedric 's death , and it would have been wrong not to fulfill that life and that role in the requisite manner . Her private love had remained sacred , and that was what counted . " Pace , I 'm not sure it is foolishness . Those prophecies have not been voided after all . When you married Blanche  --  "  | " I generated the most beautiful woman my cousin was destined to marry , " he finished . " The skein was more tangled than I realized . But that does n't necessarily mean  --  " " There have been other signals . It seems I am to leave my office soon . I think I must at least explore the possibility that it is to marry you . " There  --  she had said it . " Niobe , you owe nothing to me ! That prophecy dates from when I was a teenager ! " " But you see , Satan has evil plans for the world . I suspect that if the prophecy can be voided , that means that the child of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of man . Maybe she will never be born  --  unless the full prophecy is honored . " " That 's ridiculous ! Prophecies do n't hold parts of themselves hostagefor the performance of the rest . " " I am Fate , " she said slowly . " A prophecy is a signal of Fate . The threads of our lives run true , and we try to interfere with them at our peril  --  and perhaps the peril of man . I 'm not sure we have the right to toy with such destiny . Pace  --  I must know ! " He shrugged . " It is not that I have any aversion to you , Niobe . Far from it ! I loved you in my secret heart until I came to know Blanche , and I think that feeling remains . But I always knew you were never to be mine . I simply would not tread upon my cousin 's grave . " " Nor I on your wife 's ! But if the prophecy is voided , and there is no savior of man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I married once because it was destined to be , not for love . Love came after . I would do it again  --  if I were sure . " " How can anyone ever be sure about a thing like this ? " " I would like to consult with  --  an acquaintance . Perhaps she will know . " " And who is that ? " " Gaea . You would call her the Incarnation of Nature . " " Nature . " He nodded . " Yes  --  such an entity might know . " " I want you to be with me , so she can see us both . " He laughed tensely . " Niobe , I ca n't enter your realm ! " " Yes , you can  --  if I take you . Will you do it ? " He pondered , then shrugged . " I agree that this should be settled , one way or another . If you can take me , I will go . " She held out her hand . " Then we shall do it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have time available now . Do n't you ? " " It 's the weekend . " She took his hand . " This will be a trip to remember . " " That is my fear . " But he smiled  |p117She  flung a strand to Purgatory and slid along it , bringing him with her . They passed through the walls and the foliage of a tree , then up into the sky . Pace watched with the wonder only a mortal could have , and that restored some of the wonder for her , too . She had become jaded in thirty-eight years , as was natural enough , and it was good to be reminded of the phenomenal nature of her powers . She was not eager to give them up ! They slid through the cloudbank underlying Purgatory and stopped before Fate 's Abode . " This is where I live , now . " " A giant spiderweb ? " She shifted to her arachnid form , and back to human . " I am no longer an ordinary woman . " " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I will take you to Gaea 's green mansion . " She flung another strand , took his hand again , and slid the two of them across the pleasantlandscape of Purgatory . She remembered how Chronos had taken her from Incarnation to Incarnation , so long ago  --  his parting favor for her , laying the basis for her eventual understanding . In the interim since then , a significant segment of the Tapestry had moved by ! They arrived at the edge of the Green Mother 's demesne . Before them a hillside slope dropped into a broad valley covered with waving grain . On the far slope of the valley stood Gaea 's vegetable palace . All they had to do was cross . They started down . " You ca n't fling a web across ? " Pacian inquired . " Not here . Ge protects her environment , so it can be a challenge to reach her . " " You have not been here before ? " " Oh , yes , many times . We often consult . But this time I 'm bringing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's just her way . " " Nature does have her way , " he agreed . " All the Incarnations do . " He shook his head with mock wonder . " All this  --  up in the clouds ! " " This is not in the clouds ; it just seems that way . Purgatory is between Heaven and Hell , but it is impossible to define their locations . For convenience , we think of Heaven as above , Hell below , and Purgatory between . " " And I suppose this is n't really physical , either . " " It 's indeterminate . You and I are alive and solid , but many of the others who seem that way are neither . " He paused and turned to her . " Niobe , I am glad after all these years to learn where you have been . I can appreciate now why you had so little time for mortal matters . "  | " I had time for mortal matters ! " she said defensively . " I was spinningthe threads of life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she felt guilty for her sharp comment . He was a good and decent man , not looking for any quarrel . It was hardly his fault that she still thought of him , in a sense , as a twelveyear-oldboy . She had not changed , physically , but he had . They reached the level floor of the valley and waded into the grass . At the first step it was knee-high ; at the second , waist-high ; at the third , chest-high . They stopped . " Oh-oh , " Niobe said . " I forgot about the challenge . It 's not a matter of just walking across . There 's no telling how deep this valley really is . " " It could be a V-shaped valley  --  concealed by level grass ? " " It could be . Ge can do anything she wants with plants . " " Then we can walk under the grass , " he said . " It 's not far . " " We 'll have to , " she agreed uncertainly . They proceeded . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until it was taller than they were . Soon it was twice their height , the long , thin stems giving way elastically before them so that the broader blades at the top were undisturbed . The light dimmed as they went deeper ; it was like descending into an ocean , toward the utter dark at the bottom . Niobe put her foot down  --  and found nothing . " Oh ! " she exclaimedas she lost her balance . Pacian 's strong hand caught her windmilling arm , and he drew her back . Then he squatted to check the ground . " There is a dropoff , " he reported . " About a yard , here  --  but I suspect that is only the beginning . We need a light . " Niobe extended a glowing strand of web . Its light was not great , but it was enough . It showed that the even slope was converting to a treacherous pattern of rocks and crevices . They moved on down , now holding hands for safety . When they reached a dropoff of more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it about Pacian 's waist . Then he braced himself to support her weight while she lowered herself down . After that , he knotted the web to the stout base of a grass-stem and let himself down . She was unable to dematerialize , here . Now the gloom was Stygian indeed ! She had to extend several glowing strands to illuminate the ground clearly , for even a small hole could trap a foot and break an ankle . Even so , it was no fun . Then the ground shuddered . They paused . " What 's that ? " Niobe whispered nervously . " The tread of a monster , " he whispered back . " Now I believe in live and let live ; I value the wilderness as my cousin did , as thep119Magician does now . But the denizens do not necessarily feel the same way . " " No , they do n't ! " she agreed . " And we are in some kind of channelor ledge , here in the gloom , without defensive means . Pace , let 's get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hastened up the slope the way they had come . Pacian gave her a boost up the line they had left , though she did n't need it ; she climbed her threads magically . But he was being unconsciously chivalrous , and she appreciated the gesture . In a moment he followed , climbing up hand over hand . The thread , so thin it was almost invisible , was spelled not to cut flesh , and he was in good condition for his age . He had no trouble . The ground shuddered again ; the monster was coming closer . They rejoined hands and hurried up the slope , following the line she had left . There was no way to tell how close the monster was ; the shuddering was everywhere . Panting , they scrambled out of the grass and into the sunshine . " Oh ! " Niobe gasped . " I was so frightened ! " " Are n't you invulnerable , as an Incarnation ? " She laughed . " Of course I am ! How silly of me to forget ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He smiled , reminding her fleetingly of Cedric . They were , of course blood kin ; if Cedric had lived to this age ... " Just as well we hurried , then , " he said . Somehow they both knew that they were safe in the bright light ; the monster would not leave the shelter of the deep grass . She looked across at Gaea 's treehouse , so near and yet so far away . " But we still need to get across . " Pacian considered . " You know , that looks like a roving ocean . The surface ripples in waves under the wind . " " Too bad we ca n't sail across it , " she joked . " Ca n't we ? If this is a magic challenge  --  " Her mouth dropped open . " It could be ! " He looked about . " Perhaps a raft . I see some driftwood . " He walked over to the bonelike branches of a dead tree and began collectingthem . " This wood is strong and light . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said . " They 'll work for that . Do you really think it will float  --  on grass ? " " With magic , anything is possible , " he said cheerfully . It was evidentthat he liked a challenge . He was more animated now than she had seen him in the past two years . As Pacian worked , he commented on a river-crossing riddle that this effort brought to mind . Niobe remembered that one from her  |p120days  with Cedric . " All right , " Pacian said , smiling . " Then try this one : A coin dealer has twelve coins , one of which is counterfeit . . . " He defined the problem for her , and she struggled without success until he explained the key step in the solution . He had the same joy in such puzzles that Cedric had had . As they talked , he arranged the larger branches to make a framework , which she bound together with lengths of her thread . Then they tied smaller branches on until they had a raft about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ branches to use as poles , and several more for paddles . " But a sail would be better , " he said . That reminded her of her voyage across the college lake , on the patched-up sailboat . She was not reassured . There was no suitable material for a sail . With time and a loom she could have woven one from her threads , but of course she had no loom here . They heaved the raft onto the surface of the thick grass  --  and it floated . " That 's it ! " Pacian exclaimed . " It would never work without magic ; this is n't real water . But your friend Nature has enchanted it as a challenge , and we have found the key . " Had they ? Niobe hoped so . Pacian helped her aboard , and they shoved off . The raft floated somewhat uncertainly , and the feel was not the same as for water , but they were on their way . Poling got them well into it , but then they went beyond the depth the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet into the twisted planking , and set up the two longest paddles as oars . " Urn , we need to anchor them , " he said . Niobe saw the problem . She knelt and tied the oars to the edges with more loops of thread , so that they swung on crude fulcrums . Then Pacian started rowing  --  and the raft moved . The oars tended to slide past the leaves of grass , but there was enough friction to make it work . They were on their way , again . There was a jet of vapor down the valley . " There she blows ! " Niobe exclaimed . Then she had a second thought . What kind of whale would swim in grass ? Pacian had the same thought . He accelerated his rowing , but the clumsy raft moved slowly , while a second plume erupted , closer . The whale was coming toward them ! " Is that coincidence ? " Niobe asked worriedly . " Here ? I doubt it , " he puffed . " I do n't think we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ceased rowing . His face was red from his effort . " Another challenge ? " he gasped . " I 'm  --  afraid so . And this time we ca n't retreat . It would catch us in a moment . " He hefted a paddle , pondering . " I suppose I could try to fend it off , " he said . " If it 's big enough to take a bite of us , it 's big enoughp121to get a paddle or a pole wedged edgewise in its mouth . But I do n't like molesting wildlife . After all , we are intruders on its preserve . " " You 're a soft-hearted fool ! " she chided him . " It runs in the family , " he agreed without rancor . She was stricken . He was right . Once Cedric had taken to the wilderness , he had refused to harm any of it . And Junior 's long association with the hamadryad of the water oak had left him with a profound appreciation of the magic of the wetlands . She herself felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The leviathan drew near . Its huge snout broke the surface of the grass . The thing was big enough to swallow them whole , raft and all ! " They say that music has charms to soothe the savage breast , " Pacian said . " That is most often misquoted as savage beast . ' It just may be worth a try , rather than futile force . " Niobe liked the way his mind worked , but the leviathan terrified her . Already its ponderous jaws were cranking open . " You mean  --  sing it a song ? " " Sounds silly , 1 know  --  but it 's harmless , at least . I have sung to the animals on the farm with some success . We can always try to fight , as a last resort . Have you any idea what it might like ? " Doing requests , for a monster ? Niobe found her mind largely blank . " I  --  maybe a round  --  " He nodded agreement . He faced the leviathan as if about to deliver a speech @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you seen the ghost of Tom ? Round white bones with the flesh all gone ! O - O - O - O - O - O - O ! Would n't it be chilly with no skin on ! " Niobe started to laugh , hysterically . To sing a Halloween song to a monster ! The leviathan paused in place . The jaws stopped opening . It was listening , and like some animals , it could not focus its attention on two things at once . " Have you seen the ghost of Tom ? " Pacian sang , with greater volume and confidence . This time Niobe picked up on it , repeating the first line as Pacian continued with the second line , for it was indeed a round . It worked out rather prettily , despite the macabre and foolish words . They went through it three times , and the leviathan did not move . Whether it liked the song was uncertain ; perhaps mere curiosity held it . But that was certainly preferable to an attack.  |p122When  they stopped , the jaws slowly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long beloved in his culture : " 0 Danny-Boy , the pipes , the pipes are calling , From glen to glen and down the mountainside ... " Niobe joined in , making the harmony . She had not sung like this since her mortal days , and had almost forgotten how grand it was . " The summer 's gone , and all the leaves are falling ... " Pacian turned while singing , and reached to take her hand . " ' T is you , ' t is you must go and I must bide . " And Niobe was transfixed as the song abruptly expanded to magnificentsound . He had the magic ! The same phantom orchestra that Cedric had had when he sang . The same phenomenal magnification of the music ! Of course ! This , too , ran in the family ! Not in every member , for her son did not have it . But here and there . She had never guessed ! No wonder Pace could pacify animals ! The leviathan was aware of it too . Slowly , now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They had indeed found a way to soothe the beast . But Niobe 's attention was only partly on that . She had thought she would never love again , after Cedric . Now , suddenly , amazingly , she knew it was possible . The prophecy had not been based on what she knew , but on what she would discover . They finished the song , and the internal music faded . The leviathan did not resume its aggression , but Niobe now had need of more music . She clung to Pacian 's hand , and started a song . " In the gloaming , 0 my darling , when the lights are dim and low ... " He joined the song and the music rose in them and surrounded them . " Will you think of me , and love me , as you did once long ago ? " Even as she sang , Niobe felt the love expanding from her longisolatedheart , encompassing her being . The beginning of her love for  |p123Cedric  had come with the magic music . She had not seized upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the scant time they had had together . She was much older , and perhaps wiser now  --  and she found herself entering into it as into a primeval sea , gladly giving herself to its tide . 0 my darling .. . When the song ended and the music faded again , the leviathan was satisfied . It backed off slowly and turned about , and swam away . " It sems we have navigated the crisis , " Pacian said . " Now we can go to meet Mother Nature . " He reached for the oars . Niobe put her hand on his arm again . " Pace  --  do we need to ? " He considered , then laughed . Then he drew her in to him , and they kissed . The grand music encompassed them . They reversed course and returned to her Abode , and then to the realm of the mortals . As they landed back in his house , he said : " I do n't think I 'm going to be lonely anymore . But let 's not act precip-itously . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " We can afford time to be sure it 's real . " But she already knew it was . He nodded . " And if it is  --  " " Then I will retire on schedule , to become mortal  --  and be your wife . " " Fulfilling the prophecy , " he agreed . She left him without further comment . The moment she was alone , a babble broke out among her Aspects . Did you feel that music ? He 's a rare one ! If that 's what your first love was like , no wonder you waited for his like ! We 'll have to locate your successor , whatshername , Lisa . When 's the wedding ? " Enough , you hens ! " Niobe exploded . " It 's tentative ! " Lachesis snorted . As tentative as a pregnancy , girl ! Indeed , all that developed over the course of the following months was certainty . Niobe visited Pacian several times , and each time it was as if another layer of love was added . " I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I must marry you . " " I thought I would never be whole again , after I lost Blanche , " he said . " But it is no denigration of her to confess that now I love you as I did her . When I was a child I adored you hopelessly ; now I am a man I have reason to live again . It is as if you were saved for the time in my life when I would most need you . " He paused . " Is that coincidence ? " She shook her head . " I am an Aspect of Fate  --  but my power is limited . Lachesis handles the disposition of the threads of life I spin  --  but her power too is limited . It was Satan 's interference that caused me to lose my spouse , and you yours . Fate never planned those horrors , and now the Tapestry is healing . "  | " Yet the prophecy  --  " She sighed . " Yes , there must be a deeper current of Fate , beyond our awareness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Threads of Life are only to restore the pattern Satan sought to disrupt . It has made for a tangled skein ! " " Which our daughter  --  and granddaughter  --  will stand athwart , " he agreed . " But for the moment , there is only our love . " They kissed , and there was music . He was right ; their offspring might be destined for horrendous adventures , but at the moment love made all that beside the point . In due course , as the time of her departure from office neared , Niobe made it a point to bid adieu to her friends , the other Incarnations . First she went to the Green Mother . This time she had no trouble reaching the domicile of Nature . " You knew , did n't you ? " she charged the woman . " You arranged that challenge course ! " " Love is one of my Aspects , " Gaea admitted . " I knew your heart and his . I only facilitated what was inevitable . " " So we never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You are devious , Ge . " " Coming from Fate , that is indeed a compliment . " They embraced , and Niobe cried a little , and they parted . Gaea 's face was serene  --  but when Niobe stepped outside the domicile , she discovered a gentle rain falling , and knew that Ge was crying too . A few days later , in the course of routine business , she visited Thanatos . Fate worked most intimately with Chronos , but she also had considerable interaction with Thanatos , for the threads had to be terminated as well as started . " I am soon to return to mortality , " she said . " I pray you do not come too soon for me or the man I love . " The death's-head smiled . " I will postpone it as long as your successorpermits . Who is she to be ? " " I do n't know . We are conducting a search , but no suitable prospectnamed Lisa has shown up . " " Will Lisa be as pretty as you ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . " " I envy you , Clotho . You are able to step down voluntarily , returning to life . I will be assassinated by my successor , even as I assassinated my predecessor . " " Yet it was to Heaven you sent your predecessor , and to Heaven you will go . " " That is a comfort , " he agreed . She embraced him , not repulsed by his skeletal hands , and she kissed his grinning skull-face . His business was grim , but he was a  |p125decent  person . He was not the same one she had first met , but the office had made him similar . Her supply of yarn ran low , and she made her monthly trip to the Void for more . She wondered , as she often did , whether this monthly cycle stood in lieu of the feminine cycle that had abated when she became immortal . There were , indeed , patterns she did not understand . " So you are quitting , cutie , " Satan said , appearing before her . " Go to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been a delectable thorn in My side for too long , " he continued blithely . " It will be an excellent riddance . " " Go damn yourself . " " I really will enjoy working over your successor , scrumptious . " She paused . " Why so positive , Lord of Flies ? Can it be that you do n't want me to go ? " He puffed smoke . " Of course I want you to go ! " he said . She nodded . " Because I am fated to produce a mortal child who will be a real pain in the tail for you . " He did not respond with the derogatory or cynical exclamation she expected . Instead he was oddly pensive . " There are currents of destinythat perhaps only God comprehends , " he said . " Our glimpses of the future are fleeting and imperfect . I have taken a reading on your daughter and I see only a terrible storm perhaps forty years hence , and she is caught up in it  --  and so am I. I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chill . " And one may marry Death , the other Evil , " she said , again recalling the prophecy . " I am the Incarnation of Evil ! " he said . " Why should I ever bind Myself to a mortal woman ? " " She is to be an Incarnation . " Satan turned and paced in air , his gaze downcast . He was almost handsome in that moment of reflection . " And what woman , whether mortal or Incarnation , would ever bind herself to Me ? " It was a serious question . " Only an evil one , " Niobe said . " Are you about to birth and raise an evil woman ? " " Of course not ! " " Of course not , " he agreed . " For you are indeed a good woman , as well as a lovely one . She can only oppose Me . Yet the proph-ecy  --  " He was genuinely disturbed ! " Satan , what are you getting at ? " He faced her without any sign of cruelty or mockery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in your skein that neither of us understands . Never would I bind Myself to a good woman , nor would she to Me . Something very strange is brewing . Let us avoid the whole issue ,  |p126and  oppose each other on conventional grounds . Keep your present office , 0 lovely woman ! Do not generate that child . " Niobe was astonished . " You are pleading with me to do you a favor  --  by abrogating the fulfillment of my love ? " " I suppose I am , Clotho . I can proffer inducement if you prefer . I could assume the likeness and manner of your  --  " " You 're crazy ! " Satan sighed . " No , I am evil , not crazy . I have merely confirmed that no decent woman would accept Me if she knew My nature , howeverI might clothe Myself . You know Me , therefore you will not do for Me what you did for Chronos . " Niobe stared at him . " You  --  desire my favor ? " " I do desire it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then the memory of Cedric surged back , and the emotion became anger . " Well , you will never have it ! " " That I know . Still I would have you remain in office . " " You should know better ! " " You will not do it ? " " I will not do it ! " Now he flared brightly with his abrupt fury . " I tried to be reasonable ! To be honest , though it pains Me ! I 'm not good at it , I know , but I did try . Now you will feel the brunt of My wrath ! " " Go to Hell , Satan , " she repeated mildly . " And your child will suffer too ! " he cried as he faded out . " You and yours will rue this hour ! " He was gone  --  and Niobe found herself shivering with reaction . Had she made a mistake by refusing to deal with Satan ? He had seemed oddly pensive , and his expression of desire for her had seemed honest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he wanted , in all the forms he wanted , in Hell  --  yet none of them were good , by definition . Did he have a hankering for the opposite type ? Was there some good even in the Prince of Evil ? Surely not ! Satan 's designs were always evil , also by definition . If she opposed him , she was probably correct . If he was angry , she should be pleased . She was fulfilling the vengeance she had so long sought against him . Yet Satan was also devious . The Father of Lies knew how to deceiveby indirection as well as by direction . Why had he come to her to make his plea and why had he shown such obvious anger when she declined it ? That suggested that it was an act , and that she was in fact doing exactly what he wanted . She shook her head . Her safest course was to pursue her course as she intended , not allowing herself to be influenced in any way by  |p127Satan  . Still , it bothered her . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she  --  and her daughter  --  be vulnerable to Satan 's wrath , as mortals ? She visited Chronos next . Mindful of his reversed timeline , she phrased her farewell carefully . " Hello , Chronos . I thought I would introduce myself , as we shall be working together for the next two or three years . I am Clotho , an Aspect of Fate . " " Oh , go on ! " the child snapped . " You are n't Lisa ! " " Of course I 'm not . Lisa has gone mortal . I am Niobe . " She smiled . Chronos was eight years old , physically and emotionally . He melted like ice cream in the radiance of that smile . " Gee , you sure are pretty , Obe ! I guess you 're okay ! " " I guess I am , " she agreed . " I know you and I will get along well . " She tousled his hair . " Hey , wait a minute ! " he protested . " You live forward , not backwardlike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She smiled again , daunting him . " Smart lad ! Yes , I know you a good deal better than you know me , though that will change as you advance into my past . But when your tenure comes to a close , and you are afraid , I will come to you and hold your hand . So do n't annoy me , okay ? " " Geez , it 's weird having you come in like this , knowing so much ! Lisa was sorta timid and sweet , specially at the end when she forgot my language . I 'll sure miss her . " Forgot his language ? How could that be ? But Niobe preferred notto discuss it with him . " Just remember , sport  --  I chose her . " " Yeah , I know . Yesterday . Funny thing , you coming up with her . " " What 's so funny about bringing in a woman who can do the job ? " He stared at her a moment , then laughed teasingly . " That 's right ! You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Obe ! " " I 'll find out , " she agreed , kissed him on the forehead , shifted to spider form , and climbed out of his sight . He always enjoyed that trick . This was getting stranger . First Satan 's pointless offer and threat , then Chronos ' reaction . Chronos knew something she did n't , of course . They had been searching diligently for Lisa , and still had not found her , one day before the event . What would happen if they failed to find her ? Would there be anothersnarl in the threads , pinching the Tapestry , and could Niobe find herself stranded in office , unable to turn mortal and marry Pacian ? Was that the mischief Satan contemplated ? No , it could n't be , for the change to Lisa had occurred tomorrow ; Chronos remembered it , and Chronos was no tool of Satan 's . Shep128really did n't need to worry about it ; what would be would be  --  and she would be mortal , tomorrow . But tomorrow came with no further @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hour approached . Niobe 's better two-thirds were as mystified as she was . " The thread has to be here in the Tapestry , " Lachesis said . " But nothing distinguishes it . So it is lost until we find it . There simply is no signal that Lisa is to step out of life and into Fate . " " I 'll bid farewell to Mars , " Niobe decided . " Then it will be time , and we 'll see . " She sailed down a thread to the spot on Earth where Mars was working . This was the great double city of Budapest , at the moment torn by strife . Huge Soviet tanks were moving in the streets , and buildings were burning . She landed on a street beside him . Mars , too , was different from the one who had been in office when she first came to Purgatory . She was n't certain what the mechanism for his changing was , but it seemed to occur irregularly and without warning . But this one had been in office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , considering the differences in their philosophies . " Mars , I came to say good-bye . " He glanced at her . " Ah , so soon , lass ? There 'll never be a sweeter or prettier Clotho than you ! Give me a buss ! " She submittted to his embrace and hugged him back . She had had liaisons with him on occasion , as appropriate , and so had Lachesis . " How 's it going , Warrior ? " He released her . " Always a novelty ! See that line of refugees ? " She looked where he pointed . A seemingly endless line of bedraggledcivilians were walking along the side of the street , going north . Obviously they had been bombed out of their homes and were fleeing to whatever safety they could find . Now he took her by the shoulders and turned her to face the other way . " And those ? " She looked dutifully . Another line of refugees was traveling south . " But they 're each going where the other 's coming from ! " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that ? " " It has to be a tragedy ! No hope for either group ! " " Now you have it , lass , " he agreed gruffly . " War is hell . " She knew better , but she could n't help herself . She challenged his rationale : " How can you encourage such an appalling situation , Mars ? Those are living , feeling people there , surely innocent of the causes of this war ! "  |p129Mars  , always ready for combat , answered without hesitation . " Aye , lass , that they are , by your definition . But not by mine ! They sought freedom , so brought this consequence on their heads ! " " Freedom ? " He nodded . " Freedom to speak , to assemble , to read , to choose their own work . They forgot they were a satellite nation . Those tanks are here to remind them . " " And you approve of this ? " she demanded incredulously . " To be sure ! Freedom is the most precious thing man can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suffer to prove that they are worthy of what they seek , and I 'm proud of them ! " " And what of the tanks ? " " I am proud of them , too . " " Oh , Mars , you 're impossible ! I wish I could save even one of those poor souls ! " Mars made a gesture that included both lines of refugees . " Take your pick , Clotho . " " What ? " " If you are exchanging your office in a few minutes , you can do it with one of these . She , at least , can be spared . " The incredible boor ! Lachesis thought . But it may be true , Atropos replied . " All right , I will ! " Niobe walked out to the line going north and stopped the first young woman she spied who seemed to be traveling alone . She was a dark-haired , pretty girl of perhaps twenty , toting a large suitcase . She stared at Niobe . " Would you like to become Fate ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her blankly . " To exchange places with me and be forever free of this ? " The woman spoke unintelligibly . Of course ! Atropos thought . She 's Hungarian ! Does n't Mars speak all tongues ? Lachesis thought . " Yes ! " Niobe said . She took the woman by the hand and tugged her across the street toward the Incarnation of War . The woman seemed to have been stunned by the horror of the violence around her . Perhaps she thought Niobe was offering her a place to stay in safety for the night . " Mars , tell her , " Niobe ordered . " Ask her to exchange . " Mars spoke to the woman in her language , gesturing to Niobe . The woman shook her head , not believing it . Then a shell landed nearby , blowing out part of a building , and the woman changed her mind . She nodded affirmation . " Any port in a storm , " Mars translated.  |p130It  was Atropos ' turn to handle the change . She assumed the body . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been a pleasure working with you . " Good-by , sister Aspect , Lachesis thought , giving her a mental kiss . Atropos took the woman 's hand  --  and Niobe found herself standingseparately , in her own body , facing Atropos . " Farewell , sister Aspects ! " she cried  --  and as always , tears flowed . Mars touched one of his pockets and brought out a fragment of reddish stone . " Take this , Niobe , " he said gruffly . " It is from my planet . It will guard you from harm until you can reach your desti-nation . " Niobe took the stone . She opened her mouth to thank him . Another shell burst , close by , momentarily blinding her and causing her to cower . When she straightened up , both Mars and Fate were gone . She was on her own . Deprived of her two alternate Aspects , she felt abruptly naked . They  --  and immortality  --  were no longer part of her . Her tears continued . But she could not remain here , crying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where she was going . She hefted the suitcase and started walking.  |p131Thanks  to the Mars fragment , she made her way safely from Budapest , across the Iron Curtain , and to Ireland , where Pacian was waiting for her . She was tired and bedraggled and felt exceedingly mortal , but she was ready to marry him . But first she consulted with her son the Magician . " Satan swore to harass me and mine , " she said . " Is it possible to be secure from this ? " " Satan is constrained to operate somewhat through channels , " he replied . " My power does not approach his , but I can protect us all from his mischief . " He gave her a bright green garnet , mounted on a silver chain . " Wear this always , Mother , and you will be secure . I will see to the daughters in their turn . " " Thank you , son , " she said , smiling . He was now forty , she twenty-four , physically . " And one for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The wedding was in spring , and by summer Niobe was pregnant . The Magician 's wife , Pacian 's daughter Blenda , turned up pregnant that same summer , after five years of marriage , by what coincidence or design only Lachesis might know . Niobe and Blenda took walks together and compared notes , still seeming like sisters though Blenda was now five years older physically . When spring came again , both women gave birth to daughters within a week of each other . Niobe named hers Orb and Blenda named hers Luna , for they were like twin moons . The Magician presentedeach baby with a polished moonstone , to protect her from misfortune.  |p132The  two girls were raised together and were amazingly similar even after allowing for the fact that they were closely related . Niobe and Pacian were the ancestors of both ; strangers assumed that Orb and Luna were twins . The Magician still tended to bury himself in his studies , and Blenda had retired from teaching in order to assist him , so that Luna would spend days at a time at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was now going into tree farming , gradually remaking the wetlands without destroying it ; this took long hours . Thus most of the child care fell to Niobe . She loved it . She had given up her first child , Junior , and now was glad to make up for it by raising two . It was her fulfillment as a mother , forty years delayed . She put them together in a double pram for walks through the countryside and , when they grew old enough to do their own walking , she took them through the wetlands to admire the fine magical trees Pacian was cultivating . Sometimes they would ride their family carpet to the place where she and Cedric had lived . The old cabin had been replaced by a modern bungalow , complete with electricity and central heating , but the old water oak remained . The hamadryad was now a middle-aged nymph , showing it more by manner than by form , but she remembered Niobe , once she introduced herself , and came down cautiously to play with the little girls . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ despite the nostalgia . But she always made sure both girls were wearing their protective moonstones , for Satan could be lurking , awaiting his chance for mischief . The children reached school age , and Niobe took them there togetherand got them enrolled . She had to wrestle verbally with the clerks who assumed that two similar children whose surname was Kaftan had to be sisters if not twins . " Orb is mine , Luna is my son 's child . " They stared at her , for she was physically thirty . Both girls were bright as well as pretty . Niobe 's side of the family accounted for the beauty , and the Kaftan side accounted for the brilliance . It was genetics more than merit , but still she was inordinately proud . As school progressed , the girls became more differentiated . They adopted different clothing and hairstyles ; one would wear pink , the other green , and then they would switch . One would grow her hair long , while the other cut it short  --  and again they would switch . Luna @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and her eyes were pearl-gray ; Orb 's hair was buckwheat-honey , like Niobe 's , and her eyes pale blue . But they could still be very similar when they chose . Luna became interested in art , while Orb liked music . Luna showed real talent with pictures , proceeding from crayons to pastel chalk to watercolors and finally to oil ; her efforts were always prominently represented in class shows . Orb started with the guitar and gravitatedp133to the piano , then centered on the harp . She had genuine talent for it , and when she was ten , she gave a recital of The Shepherd 's Song that sounded so like the magic music her father and grandfather had had that Niobe was stunned . She had the magic -- and it reached a short way out beyond physical contact to touch those who listened closely . The audience , though it heard only the physical music , was still entranced , and applauded her enthusiastically . By the time they were twelve , both girls were almost as pretty as their mothers had been , and their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had better equipment , " Pacian said and he took Niobe to see the Magician . " The instruments exist , " the Magician said . " But they have to be won . They are in an annex to the Hall of the Mountain King . The King sleeps , but an attempt to steal anything would wake him , and that would be unfortunate . " " I do n't want them stealing anything ! " Niobe protested . " They 're honest girls ! " The Magician smiled tolerantly . " To be sure , Mother . But you must understand the Mountain King 's definition . He will freely give the instruments to any person he deems worthy of them  --  but what he calls worthy , we might call theft . " " That 's preposterous ! " " Not so , Mother , " he informed her patiently . " A person who can take the instrument deserves it ; the one who can not , but who tries to , is a thief . " " There are standards  --  an examination ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said . " Then ademonstration of proficiency for the specific instrument . " " Challenges ? " She was n't sure she liked the sound of it . Not fortwelve-year-old girls . " The Annex is deep in the mountain , of course . There are cliffs , pitfalls , monsters  --  that sort of thing . Routine . " " Routine ! I 'm not sending my child or yours into that ! Those girls are only  --  " " Twelve years old , " he finished for her . " Mother , the challenges are only illusions . No danger  --  as long as the unworthy person does not attempt to steal an instrument . " Now it was coming clear . " They run the course  --  and if they get through without making an error , then they can try for the prizes ? " " Precisely . And if they do make an error , they have simply to depart immediately , without waking the King . He gets angry when awoken . " " And proceeding on , after an error , wakes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wise to do that . "  |p134She  pondered . " Exactly what would happen if he wakes ? " " He would turn the challenges real . " " Real pitfalls , instead of illusory ones ? " " That 's it , Mother , " he said with the calmness that a person of normal intelligence assumes when dealing with one of limited intellect . " And if that person attempts to steal  --  " " Then  --  not that our girls would , but  --  ? " " Then the Mountain King would personally intervene . I could not protect them in the King 's hall ; he is omnipotent there . The moonstonesprotect them from evil , but the Mountain King is not evil , just tough . But it should never come to that . " " I would n't let them take the risk ! " He shrugged . " Why do n't you go along to chaperone them ? Then you can be sure they do n't do anything foolish . The Mountain King is a fair man ; he will not bother anyone who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Run the challenges with them ? " " Of course you can , Mother ! " he said , as if her intellect had turned out to be below his already-modest expectations . " The King is not fussy about details . I would take the girls in myself , but he would n't tolerate my presence . Rival magic , you know . " " The instruments are good ones ? " " The best that exist , Mother , " he assured her patiently . " State of the art . " She sighed . " Then I 'll do it . " She took them in , parking the car beside the huge sign : MOUNTAIN KING  --  ANNEX . They entered the marked aperture , which resembled a jewel-encrusted cave . The girls were thrilled and nervous . They had heard stories about the nefarious halls of the Mountain King , but had never hoped to visit them personally . They had wanted to dress prettily , but Niobe had insisted on jeans and sneakers . " This is n't a fashion show ! " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CHALLENGES . They took the latter direction . The passage opened into a large cave with a rocky floor . A painted yellow line wound around between the rocks to the far side . Several motorcycles were parked at the near side . A big sign said INSTRUCTIONS . Niobe moved over to read the sign . Smaller print on it clarified the conditions of the challenge . She read and whistled . " This really is a challenge ! " The girls read the sign . " Mother , we ca n't do that ! " Orb protested . " I confess I do n't like it , " Niobe agreed . " But remember : the hazards are not real . They 're illusions. "  |p135The  challenge was to ride a motorcycle along the line , which was the only safe route across the minefield . Because this was the first , one error was permitted . Because the mines were illusions , they would merely flash brightly when set off , rather than blow the transgressorapart . " How sweet of the Mountain King , " Niobe murmured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off two , " Luna said , " we ca n't get our instru-ments ? " " That 's right , dear . Because if we took anything after failing the challenge of passage , those mines would become real . " It was , she had to admit , a nice device of selection . Those who could handle the challenges would have no problem ; those who could not would be absolute fools to trigger the non-illusory threats . The Mountain King played a hard but fair game . " Ooo , " Orb murmured softly . She was the more reactive of the two , quicker to turn on or off , quicker to anger or to forgiveness . " But if we play the game honestly , we have nothing to fear . " " That 's right . That 's a good rule for life . " Niobe looked at the motorcycles , and at the minefield , and the meandering line . How much clearance was there on either side of it ? And the girls  --  neither had ridden more than a bicycle before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This was too much of a challenge ! " I 'd better take you across , one at a time , " Niobe decided . " The largest cycle will handle two . " She wheeled out the large motorcycle , started it  --  trusting that the cave was large enough to handle the fumes of the exhaust  --  and rode it up and down the side , making sure she had the hang of it . Obviously the Mountain King had expected a man to challenge , rather than a woman and girls . When she was satisfied , she put Orb on it behind her , the girl clasping her about the middle , and rode up to the side again . " Now lean with me when I make the turn , " she said . " The balance has to be just so , as with a bicycle . " " Yes , Mother . " " Luna , you have the eye for depth . You watch us , and cry warning if I seem to be misjudging a curve . " " Yes , Grandma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; in public they preferred to consider themselves cousins . Niobe nerved herself and started along the line . The first curve went well , but when she hit the reverse curve , Orb got confused and started to lean the wrong way . She corrected herself in a moment , but it was enough to nudge the cycle off the mark . A mine was touched , and a brilliant flash blinded her . " I ca n't see ! " Niobe cried . " Neither can I ! " Orb screamed.  |p136The  motorcycle wavered as she tried to guide it along the course by memory . But she knew it was hopeless ; by the time her vision recovered , she would be in the middle of the mines , and thoroughly disqualified . Unless " Luna ! " she called . " Can you see ? " " Yes , " Luna replied . " You 're drifting right . " " Direct me ! " Luna was a smart and levelheaded girl . She understood immediately . " Bear left . " Niobe obeyed , maintaining a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Now turn right , slowly , " Luna called . " A little more  --  yes . And straight . Coming up is an acute left turn  --  make it sharp on the mark . Ready  --  mark ! " Niobe and Orb leaned left , and they made a sharp left turn . " Now go straight  --  nudge right  --  yes  --  now an S-turn , right then left , not too sharp  --  more right  --  now edge left  --  more  --  that 's it  --  and right again . Now straight ; you 're almost there . " Thus did they navigate the field without setting off another mine . Niobe parked the motorcycle , waited a few minutes for her vision to clear , then rode back alone to fetch Luna . " You did a good job there , " she told the girl . " Your judgment has preserved our chance to win through . " The girl flushed prettily with pleasure . The second trip across was less eventful ; sight and experience made all the difference . They parked the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This turned out to be a subterranean river , broad and deep , with a wire mesh fence bisecting it lengthwise , barring passage across it . But there was another explanatory plaque . " This is a section of the River Lethe , " Niobe read aloud . " One drop in the mouth will cause a person to forget for a moment ; one swallow will cause forgetfulness for an hour . Water in eyes will cause the forgetting of the ability to see . Beware lethal monster who patrols at irregular intervals . " " That 's funny ! " Orb exclaimed . " The lethal monster swims in Lethe ! " " Not funny if it catches you , " Luna reminded her . " We shall have to swim across , " Niobe said . " The problem is the barrier in the center  --  we 'll have to dive under it . That means closing the eyes tightly . We 'd better do it singly , with the others watching while one dives . " " But  --  our clothing ! " Orb protested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave it here . We do n't want to carry the water of Lethe around with us ! Also , wet clothing is no fun . " " But we have no bathing suits ! " Luna said.  |p137Niobe  looked at her . " Dear , soon enough you will be proud to stand nude for self-portraits . There are occasions when modesty is dispensable . This is one such . We are all family and female , and the Mountain King is asleep . No one will see . I daresay this is part of his challenge : have we the courage to go naked to his lair ? Remember , the danger is only illusion ; if we gulp the water we will not actually forget , we 'll merely disqualify ourselves and have to give up the quest . The real test is modesty . " She proceeded to undress , carefully folding her clothing and setting it well clear of the water . Luna shrugged and followed her example , not unduly sensitive about the matter . After a pause , Orb followed suit , obviously less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the process of developing , neither women nor children , and were understandably somewhat reticent about exposure . The Mountain King was giving this party a greater variety of challenge than anticipated . " Now we can dog-paddle to the barrier , " Niobe said . " Right after the monster passes . Who 's first ? " Orb shrugged . " I 'll try it . Someone yell if the monster turns back . " They waited , watching for the lethal monster . In a moment it appeared  --  aglobular mass of jelly that seemed to have forgotten its original form . " Ooh , ugh ! " Orb exclaimed . " It 's only illusion , " Niobe reminded her firmly . " But do n't let it catch you . Now scoot ! " She slapped the girl on her bare bottom . Startled , Orb stepped into the water and dog-paddled across , glancingnervously after the monster . " Remember  --  no peeking ! " Niobe called . " Keep your eyes closed after you come up on the other side , until you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then took half a breath , squinched her eyes shut , and dived . Her legs went up , then slid under . Both girls were good swimmers ; it was only the special nature of this challenge that made the swimming awkward . In a moment she came up on the far side , eyes and mouth still firmly closed , and resumed her dog-paddling  --  in the wrong direction . She was swimming downstream instead of across . " You 're going wrong ! " Niobe called . " Turn about ! " The girl , still sightless , did n't understand . She reversed course , now swimming upstream , making little headway . " The monster 's coming back ! " Luna whispered . " She 'll never avoid it ! " Niobe said tersely . " I 'll go get her clear ! " She waded in and stroked as swiftly as she could without splashing . Fortunately the monster was slow ; she outdistanced it . She closed her mouth and eyes and dived , finding the bottom of the barrier and hauling herself under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she hoped Orb was . Her head broke water , dripping  --  and she did n't dare open her eyes.  | " To your left ! " Luna called . Niobe lunged left , and encountered one of Orb 's arms . " But the monster 's between you and the shore ! " Luna called . " You ca n't get by it ! It 's turning toward you ! " " This way ! " Niobe ordered Orb . " To the barrier ! " She sidestrokedback , half-hauling the girl along with her other hand . She found the wire . " Climb up it ; you do n't need to look ! " Wordlessly , the girl obeyed . Niobe made sure Orb had hold of the wire , then let go of her and used hands and feet to climb up out of the water . Once clear , she used the back of her hand to wipe out both eyes , then cracked one open . Orb was beside her , climbing blindly up the barrier . The monster was below , trying to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here , idiot ! " Niobe told it . The monster heard and tried to reach out of the water , but its substance was too flabby for support . It could not extend any part of itself beyond the river . After a while it gave up and drifted on downstream . " Very well , " Niobe said . " Orb , clear your eyes and climb down . We 'll swim the rest of the way across . " They did so . Then Luna crossed and , with the help of Niobe 's called instructions , managed to avoid all hazards . They had surmountedthe second challenge . Naked , they proceeded to the third . This one turned out to be awesome ; it was a deep chasm , crossed by a narrow rope bridge . They would have to walk or crawl across it . There was another instructionplaque that said BEWARE OF THE VAMPIRE BAT . That needed no clarification . Obviously a bite by that bat would disqualify them  --  and the bat would attack whoever was on the bridge . But the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be used to fend off the bat . Sure enough , there was a rack holding three wands . One for each of them . How convenient ! Or was it coincidence ? Niobe did n't quite trust this , but saw no alternative to proceeding . They were two-thirds of the way through ; it would be a shame to muff it now . Orb stared down into the gulf and shuddered . " I do n't think I can  --  " " Nonsense , " Niobe said , though she herself found the depth of the chasm awesome . " Remember  --  it 's illusion . If you lose your balance , you wo n't get hurt ; you 'll just be disqualified . " " Oh , yes , " she said , brightening . " It 's just a flat floor , like the mine caves , and the bridge 's a line through it . "  | " But we 'll be careful , anyway , " Niobe cautioned them . " I 'll go first , " Luna volunteered . She took a wand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the bridge . It sank beneath herweight , startling her , but she kept her balance and walked on . " Ooo , it 's swinging ! " she exclaimed as she moved over the gulf . Indeed it was , swinging grandly back and forth like a pendulum . " Compensate ! " Niobe called . " You 're all right ! " Luna did , and continued across . At midpoint the bat appeared . The thing was huge and ugly . Bright red eyes stared at the prey . The black wings spread out a good yard . As it approached , the draft from those wings blew Luna 's hair back and made her lose confidence . " Fend it off with the wand ! " Niobe called . " Just stand there , keep your balance , and point the wand at it . " Luna tried , but she was now quite nervous . The bat flew at her ; she lunged with the wand . The bat sheered away . She lost her balance and started to fall . " Grab the bridge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and grabbed the bridge with both hands , hugging it . The wand plunged into the chasm , slowing turning in the air , taking a long time to fall . Some illusion ! The bat , seeing the girl helpless , banked and came back . Niobe charged out onto the bridge . Her long experience with the threads of Fate made her competent ; she was n't worried about missinga step or falling . She almost dived at the bat as it came down , jamming the end of the wand into its furry body . There was no resistance ; the wand passed through . The bat shrieked almost audibly and lurched away , seemingly hurt . " Get up , girl , " Niobe snapped . " Go on across . " " I ca n't ! " Luna cried . Indeed , she was in tears . She was a sensible girl , but she was , after all , only twelve . " Then crawl across ! I 'll protect you . " This the girl could do . She scrambled on hands and knees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The creature tried to come in for another pass , looked at Niobe 's militant stance , and stayed clear . On the far side , Luna was able to stand again . She was all right . " Your turn , Orb , " Niobe called . " Can you make it yourself , or shall I come to help you ? " Orb looked at the swinging bridge , and at the hovering bat . " I  --  you 'd better come . " Niobe walked back , holding off the bat with a mere glance . It had come to know the difference between a frightened girl and an embattledwoman . " All right  --  walk ahead of me . I 'll protect your rear . Just focus on Luna over there and keep your balance . It 's not hard . "  | " How can you be so brave ? " the girl asked , awed . " I 'm a mother . It comes with the office . " It was an offhand quip , but Orb took it seriously . " Having a child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you would die to protect , it ceases to be a matter of courage , " Niobe explained . " You just know what you have to do and you ca n't afford fear . " They moved on across . The bat came at them , and Orb cowered . " Get away ! " Niobe screamed at the bat . " Or I 'll ram this down your throat , batbrain ! " It spun in the air and fled . Even illusions could be cowed ! " Why is it afraid of you ? " Orb asked , amazed . " Because I was n't bluffing , " Niobe answered . " I would wring its neck if it touched you , and it knows it . " " Oh , Mother ! " " Any parent would do the same . You will , when you are one . " They made it across . Luna shook her head . " You 've had to save us each time , Grandma . We 'd never have made it alone . " " It 's a cooperative effort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instrumentsfor yourselves . " They walked to the next chapter . There were two cabinets . In one was a paintbrush with a silver handle ; in the other was a miniature golden harp . " This is it , " Niobe said . " There are your instruments . " " But  --  " Luna said . " How do we  --  ? " Niobe looked around . She saw no instruction plaque . " I think you have to figure that out for yourselves . " Luna shrugged . She stepped up , opened the cabinet doors , and took the brush . She made a pass in the air  --  and the brush left a smear of yellow hanging there , unsupported . Surprised , she moved the brush again , marking an X across the smear . Black appeared , a big X in air . " It makes color from thought ! " Luna exclaimed , pleased . She went to work seriously , erasing the smear and X with deft strokes , then painting a picture of Niobe . Luna , young as she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Niobe had never seen the girl paint so fast and well before . Of course , she was n't totally thrilled to have herself painted nude at the physical age of thirty-six ; she had put on some weight and was no longer the most beautiful woman extant . The stretch marks from birthing Orb did n't help . But she was n't in a position to protest ; she wanted Luna to paint well enough to win the brush . The instrument was obviously ideal . Then Luna added a gauzy halo of almost colorless paint . " What are you doing ? " Niobe asked  | " Painting your aura , " Luna replied . " MY  --  ? " I can see it , so I 'm painting it . " Niobe was silent . If what the girl said was true , she had more talent than anyone had judged . Luna paused and stepped back . " There , " she said . She had painted a huge seashell partly enclosing the figure . " Nude Grandmother on the half-shell . " " For pity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Orb giggled . Then the picture moved in the air . It tilted , developed a frame , and moved into the cabinet . The glass doors closed . " I think your picture has been accepted , " Niobe said . " You have earned the brush . " " Oh , goody ! " Luna exclaimed . " Thank you , Mountain King ! I 'll use it always ! It 's the best brush I ever dreamed of ! " Now it was Orb 's turn . She opened the cabinet and lifted out the golden harp . It was small , but exquisitely crafted , surely the finest instrument of its kind . She seated herself cross-legged on the floor , set the base of the harp within the circle of her legs so she could hold it steady , and touched the strings with her fingers . A fine chord sounded . " Ooo , it 's truly magic ! " she exclaimed . " I can really play this ! " Orb paused a moment , mentally selecting a song . Then she began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to waltz in the wetlands ... " Niobe was astonished . She had n't known that Orb knew that song ; she must have learned it at school . She was doing it very well , and the magic harp amplified both the sound and the natural magic she had , so that the background orchestra sounded loud and clear and stereophonic . Twelve years old ! How well would Orb sing and play and project when she achieved her full proficiency ? Probably well enough to turn professional , if she chose . " Yes I  --  will cry  --  I ' 11 cry when the wetlands are dry , " Orb finished and bowed her head . There were tears on her cheeks , and on Luna 's and Niobe 's too ; it had been truly beautiful . Then the song sounded again  --  but Orb was n't singing or playing . The cabinet was doing it . The song had been recorded , magic orchestraand all ! The replay ended , and the cabinet doors closed . This , too , had been accepted . Orb had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Niobe said , relieved . " Now we can go home . " They started back . The bat cave had been turned off , and was now apparent as a concavely curving floor eighteen inches below the swinging bridge ; the bat was a transparent light projection . The wand Luna had dropped lay on the stone ; its long fall had been illusion.Therehad , indeed , been no danger . " To think I crawled on hands and knees ! " Luna said ruefully . " As a challenge , it was valid , " Niobe said , picking up the wand to replace it in the wand-holder . " Even illusions can hurt , as when we were blinded . Life is like that too ; the unreal can be as important as the real , and sometimes it becomes real . " She was consciously lecturing the girls , knowing that all too soon they would enter the arena of social and sexual awareness , where the pitfalls were indeed of perception . They crossed , not bothering to use the bridge , and took the tunnel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really was a river and a barrier . " That 's a relief , " Luna said . " I 'd hate to think I went naked to swim through water that did n't exist ! " " But now it 's just water , " Orb said , scooping up a handful and sipping it . " And no blubber monster . " They waded in , the girls holding their instruments clear of the water as long as they could . There was a momentary flicker of light . Then Orb dived under the barrier and came up on the other side . She took a breath as she broke the surface  --  and screamed . Niobe halted at the barrier . " What is it , dear ? " she called , alarmed . " I ca n't see ! " Orb cried . " I 'm blind ! I 'm blind ! " She flailed about , dropping the harp , which sank to the bottom . " Wait , dear ! " Niobe cried . " Relax ! It ca n't be  --  " " Where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " How did I get here ? Why ca n't I see ? " Niobe exchanged glances with Luna , whose mouth opened in an appalled O. " The Lethe ! " the girl whispered . " It 's on again ! " " And this time it 's real ! " Niobe exclaimed . " Something 's wrong ! " The lethal monster appeared , moving slowly toward Orb . " Get back out of the water ! " Niobe cried to Luna . " I 'll rescue her ! " She took a breath , closed her eyes , and dived under the barrier . She was able to spot Orb by the noise of her splashing . She took hold of the girl and used the life-saving technique to haul her along . Niobe had to trust that her sense of direction was true and that she was swimming for the opposite bank . She did not dare open her eyes , or try to speak to her daughter ; some water would be sure to splash in . She had no notion how close the monster was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . She found the bank and hauled Orb out . She cleared her eyes , then shook the girl by the shoulders to get her attention . " Be still , Orb ! You 've been dosed with the water of Lethe , so you ca n't see or remember , but the effect is temporary . Soon you will see and remember . Just relax . Relax ! " Slowly the girl calmed . " Oh , Mother , " she cried , and hugged Niobe . " I 'm so scared ! " So she remembered the basic relationship . Probably it was only the most recent events that were gone . " It will pass , " Niobe reassuredher . " You 're not hurt , just inconvenienced for a few minutes . Just sit here and do n't move . " Then she looked across the river . Luna was standing on the far side . " Are you all right , Luna ? " " I 'm all right , " the girl called . " Should I cross ? " Niobe considered momentarily . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether it too has been reactivated . Do n't try to cross it , though ! " " I would n't dare ! " Luna said seriously . She disappeared into the tunnel . Orb 's tears seemed to help clear the spell from her eyes . " Mother ! I can see a little ! " " Yes , of course , dear , " Niobe said , expressing more confidence than she had felt . " Just have patience , and you will soon be back to normal . " After a while that seemed longer than it was , Luna returned . " It 's back , " she reported . " I knelt at the edge and reached down , and I could n't feel the floor at all . Then the bat came , and I ran . " How did the illusion of a chasm become real , Niobe wondered . An eighteen-inch fall could not duplicate the effect of a hundred-foot fall . But she was sure that chasm was now there . The Mountain King 's magic was no illusion ! " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It 's easier for you than it would be for Orb , and I think we can handle the minechamberbetter . " " What happened ? " Orb asked as Luna crossed . Evidently her memory had not caught up to the last few minutes . " We were crossing the river  --  and the magic came on , " Niobe said . " I do n't know why . It 's as if we were suddenly considered thieves instead of worthy winners . " " But we 're not thieves ! " Orb protested . " Of course we 're not ! " Then something occurred to her . " But maybe there is a thief , somewhere in here , and he activated the magic  --  and we got caught . " " But we saw no one else ! " " True . " Niobe sighed ; it had been such a good explanation . Then she thought of an answer . " One could have tried the first challenge ,  |p144and  set off more than one mine , and not retreated . That might account @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I got it ! " she exclaimed , brandishingthe harp . " I felt for it on the bottom , and there it was ! " " Oh , thank you , Moth ! " Orb exclaimed . " That 's okay , Eyeball , " Luna replied , smiling as she handed it to her . Niobe was startled in a minor way ; she had not heard these particularnicknames before . She wondered how much of children 's activitiesinattentive adults missed . They dressed and proceeded cautiously to the mine-cave , half expecting to encounter the thief , but there was none . The cave was empty . They tested it by tossing a stone into the center and hiding their eyes . The explosion was horrendous . It shook the whole cave , and severalmore rocks dropped from the ceiling . The hazard was certainly back  --  and now the mines were truly destructive . Niobe looked at the one motorcycle on this side , the one they had ridden across on . Her mouth went dry . She had crossed this cave three times , once while blind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This time the hazard was real . She and the girls could be blown up ! The very knowledge of that could cause her to waver on the cycle and go astray . Already her hands were shaking . " Where 's the thief ? " Luna asked . Where , indeed ! If the thief had done this by pushing on regardless , he should be here  --  either alive or dead . The motorcycle he had used should be visible , either whole or wrecked . But there was none  --  and all the other cycles were still parked in their places . There seemed to be no thief . Well , maybe the Mountain King was cheating . He might have had no intention of giving away his precious magical instruments , so he arranged to balk the girls ' escape as if by accident . That angered Niobe . " Two can play at that ! " she muttered . She picked up another fallen rock . " Watch yourselves ! " she warned , and heaved it . There was another detonation . Again the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the cave was quiet , Niobe picked up anotherrock and heaved it . " What are you doing , Mother ? " Orb asked after the third explosion . " I am clearing a path through this trap ! " Niobe said grimly . " A mine ca n't explode when it has already been exploded . " She heaved again . " Oh ! " Orb exclaimed , smiling . " How smart of you , Mother ! Can I do it too ? "  |p145Why  not ? " Yes you may  --  but shield your eyes . " The girl picked up a rock and heaved , then turned away . She clapped her hands with delight as the mine went off . Children of either sex seemed to have a certain muted passion for violence , Niobe reflected . Before long they had cleared a broad channel across the cave . They tossed in a few more rocks , just to be sure there were no live mines left . Then Niobe ferried them across as before . She was n't sure what would happen if they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motorcycle was easy enough to use , now . Safely across , she parked it , and the three of them turned to the entrance/exit passage . But as they approached , a man came through it from the other direction . He was huge and hairy and ferocious , he carried a giant sledgehammer , and his eyes fairly sparked so that they threatened to set fire to his beard . " Thieves ! " he roared . " You would rob the museum of the Vanir ? I will destroy you ! " He lifted the sledgehammer . " The Mountain King ! " Luna squeaked , falling back . Something akin to a berserker rage flooded through Niobe . She stepped forward , sidestepped the swinging sledge , and slapped the man resoundingly on his hairy cheek . " Leave that girl alone ! " she snapped . " She 's no thief ! You are ! " The man could hardly have been hurt by the slap , but he paused , astonished , as he stared at her . " Clotho ! " " Not anymore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , paused . " How did you know me ? " He set his sledgehammer down and leaned on the handle . " How could any man forget the face of the loveliest creature to grace the pagan realm ? What do ye here , 0 divine one ? " Niobe stifled a flush of pleasure . " Um , how long have you been asleep this time ? " The Mountain King ticked off numbers on his fingers . " Twentyfiveyears or so . Why ? " That explained it . He had been asleep all the time she had been mortal . " I returned to ordinary life thirteen years ago , " Niobe said . " I 'm here with my daughter and granddaughter . We did not come here to steal from you . " The man glanced at the instruments the girls held . " If you speak for these , Clotho , I 'll not challenge them . Indeed , methought in my dream I heard the music of my harp , played in a manner it was crafted to be . " Then he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thirteen years ? Your body would madden any man 's mind , but  --  " " By my prior mortality , " Niobe said quickly . She gestured to Luna . " Your cabinet accepted the picture she painted , so  --  "  | " True . Then why the alarm ? " " That 's what I want to know ! We were halfway out when  --  " " ' T is not of my doing , " the giant said . " I will have the truth of this . Follow me , Clotho . " He strode into the cave , and his footprints glowed in his wake . He was angry . They followed , not bothering with the motorcycle this time ; the glowing prints were their guarantee of safety . When the Mountain King came to the middle cave , he stepped into the water  --  and it evaporated instantly , leaving the floor dry . When he reached the barrier , a gate in it swung open to let him pass without pause . There was no doubt he was the master of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chasm was there in the third cave , and the vampire bat alert . The King strode into it , and the illusion or . They came into the display room . There was a demon with its finger in the harp-cabinet . Evidently that evil influence was what was triggeringthe thief-alarm ; as long as that demon remained , no one could pass . " Ho ! Loki 's work ! " the Mountain King exclaimed , and hurled his massive sledge as if it were a toy . The hammer struck the demon . The creature puffed into smoke . The cabinet exploded . The Mountain King retrieved his sledgehammer . The far-flung fragments of the cabinet imploded , re-forming their original shape , with a hint of the music Orb had made . " Go in peace , Clotho , " the giant rumbled . " You and yours . My apology for this nuisance . " " Quite all right , sir , " Niobe said , somewhat taken aback . She hustledthe girls out again . This time there was no problem in any of the caves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to prosperin their talents . By the time they completed school , each was as skilled as any Niobe knew . She was sure both would prosper in life , if Fate permitted . But there was the matter of the tangled skein that had not yet materialized . After Blenda died , the Magician Kaftan moved to America with Luna , apparently unable to face the old country in her absence . Niobe was saddened more by Luna 's departure than by her son 's , for she had actually been closer to her granddaughter . But she could not protest . Luna was a fine , levelheaded young woman , and she would take good care of her father.  |p147Then  , after twenty-two years of their marriage , Pacian died . He was seventy-four , by no means young , but it came as a shock ; somehow she had always thought of him as eleven years younger than herself , and she was only forty-six , physically . She had lived twentythreeyears in her first mortality , and the same number in her second . It was as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love of Cedric . She still loved Pacian , but the intensity of it had eased over the years . Now she had raised her family , and was satisfied to meet the necessary severance of threads . She had seen Pace ailing , and had done what she could for him , never thinking he could actually die . Satan seemed to have no hand in this ; the cause had been natural . After the funeral , she tended to retreat from participation in worldly matters . Orb went away on tour as a singer ; indeed , she had been traveling about the world from the time she turned eighteen . There just was n't much left for Niobe in the mortal realm . Then she received news that her son , the Magician , had also died . This was entirely unexpected ; he was only sixty-three . Luna wrote to report that she now lived alone in the Magician 's house , carrying on his business , and that she was dating the new Thanatos , exactly as the prophecy had foretold . Niobe had no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and left the girl alone . What , after all , had she expected of mortality  --  perpetual youth , bliss , and innocence ? She was in as good a position as any woman to know better . She was chronologically eighty-six years old ; she had outlived her time . Her comfortable , placid world had been replaced by the modern high-tech , high-magic world . She was prepared to depart it with a minimum of fuss . But the following year , things changed.  |p148The  spider descended before her on a thread of silk , then transformed into a comely young woman with hair so light it was almost white . " We must talk with you , " the woman said . " Do not utter the name of him who must not know . " She had an accent , but was intelligible . " Clotho ! " Niobe said , suddenly remembering that moment a quarter-century before when she had drawn a refugee girl from a line in Budapest . " Lisa ! " The woman smiled . " You have changed ; I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Except cosmetically . I am eternally grateful for what you did , rescuing me from that city . It gave me a new existence , and 1 was able to help my troubled friends . They never knew I had  --  changed . " " I understand , " Niobe said . " It is nice of you to let me know . " " But this is not a social call , " Lisa said quickly . " We  --  have something very important to ask of you . " Niobe smiled . Privately she was dismayed by the contrast between them . When she had selected Lisa to be her replacement , Niobe herself had been a slender beauty , while Lisa had been attractive but less stunning . Now , a quarter-century later , Niobe knew herself to be lined and dumpy ; she had n't seen any reason to maintain herself , the last two years especially . Lisa had remained exactly as she had been . What a terrible scourge mortal aging was ! " If your question is whether the  --  unnamed one  --  has been interferingin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure . I can think of only one instance , when I took my girls to  --  "  | " No , no , " Lisa said quickly . " Not a question . I  --  I have been selected to ask you this , because I am the only one of us who has met you . Lachesis and Atropos have changed  --  " " Terms are getting shorter these days ! " Niobe remarked . " I was an Aspect for thirty-eight years ! " " Yes , you were one of the great ones , and you dealt well with  --  the anonymous . I  --  we  --  had a difficult time . He twisted the threads without license , he confused us  --  " " He does that , " Niobe agreed . " If I was proof against him later , it was because I had some hard lessons early ! I 'm sure I was no better than  --  " " Yes , you have had much experience . More than any other mortal . That is why we must ask this thing of you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this thing ? " " You must come back . " " What ? " " To be an Aspect of Fate . We need you again . " Niobe was so surprised she stuttered . " To  --  to be  --  I , I  --  Lisa , I 'm forty-eight years old , in mortal terms ! Only a young woman can  --  " Lisa shook her head . " Not to be Clotho . To be Lachesis . That is the key Aspect  --  the one who governs the Tapestry . " Lachesis  --  of course . Niobe was now middle-aged in body , and looked it . Lachesis was the middle-aged Aspect . Yet " Lisa , I never dreamed  --  it 's never been done before ! Once an Aspect returns to mortality  --  once any Incarnation leaves the of-fice  --  " " True . That is one reason we believe it must be done this time . The unnamed will never suspect . " To fool Satan . That was one way to do it , certainly ! " Lisa , I 'm flattered that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had my turn at immortality , and do n't really deserve  --  " " It is much to ask of you , we know , " Lisa said hurriedly . " But you are the only one who can do it . Otherwise  --  " " Now wait , Lisa ! New women come into the office all the time ! Everyone'learns on the job , and Fate is more fortunate than the other Incarnations , because there are always two experienced Aspects to guide the new one . So you certainly do n't have to  --  " " Please , " the woman said . " Perhaps I do not make myself clear . I could speak better in my native tongue  --  " " You are speaking perfectly ! I 'm just trying to say  --  " " Please , I must explain . We  --  we must depart our Aspects  --  all together . " " All at once ? That 's impossible ! There would be no  --  "  | " Yes , we think the unnamed has arranged it . There has been much trouble , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of us have had to help intervene to save her . He tried to make her die , but Thanatos would not permit it  --  " Something clicked in Niobe 's mind . " That period last year , when people mysteriously stopped dying  --  ? " " Yes . Thanatos stopped taking souls so he would not have to take hers , because he loves her . Finally he faced the unnamed down . Luna was spared , and Thanatos went back to work . We  --  Lachesis arranged to select him for the office , so that would happen . " " You interfered in the selection of another Incarnation ? " Niobe asked , horrified . " We  --  it was necessary . This is  --  we think it is the major battle of the war . I do not like war . " Lisa paused , and Niobe knew she was remembering Budapest . " But when the tyranny of Evil advances , it must be fought by whatever means . The battles are terrible , but ... " Now Niobe saw the tangle of the skein . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason for her astonishing association with Thanatos was apparent . Only Thanatos could stop a person from dying , once that thread had been cut . Still  --  ! " How did you know about the plot against Luna ? " " The Magician , her father , he knew . He studied magic all his life and knew of a prophecy that the unnamed intended to void . The Magician planned everything and gave up his life to introduce Luna to Thanatos in a manner that would deceive the  --  " " So that 's why he died young ! They never told me ! " " They could not , lady . No one could know until it was done . The Magician knew he had to protect his daughter beyond his own time , for the fate of mankind depends on her . " " So little I knew ! " Niobe lamented . " I thought he was burying himself in magic just for  --  for a hobby . Or business . But he must have understood the prophecy far better than  --  " " Yes . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that he stopped the unnamed from doing something else , but he wo n't say . He knows the future , but if he said , it would change , so  --  " " So the Incarnations are all involved in  --  in a major engagement , " Niobe concluded . " A twenty-year engagement , " Lisa agreed . " The unnamed means to take political power on Earth . His agents are at work in every nation , but America is difficult because its politics are so chaotic anyway . If he prevails there , the rest will fall in line , he believes , because of the economic leverage . So he must be stopped there , and Luna will cast the key vote against him  --  if she survives . "  | " And she wanted to be an artist ! " Niobe exclaimed . " Now we believe that we , the three Aspects of Fate , are at the center , " Lisa continued . " The unnamed means to be rid of Luna , and we know that  --  " " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to protect her ! " Niobe finished . " Of course I will do it  --  will become the Aspect of Lachesis  --  if that 's what it takes ! But I never performed in that Aspectbefore , and  --  what 's this business about all three of you changing together ? If the unnamed is pressing you as you suggest , that would he absolute folly ! Three novices together  --  " " Yes . Folly . That is why we come to you . You have experi-ence  --  " " That part I see ! But you other two would have to remain , at least for a year or two  --  " " We can not , " Lisa said . " We must change now  --  this week . " " That 's preposterous , girl ! You know what 's at stake ! " " We know . But we have opportunities that come only once in a lifetime , if ever . We can not turn those down , any more than you could have turned down your second love . The chance to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You make your point . We are all frail human creatures ! Yet if you know , or suspect , that these opportunitieshave been arranged by  --  " " He has , as you say , sweetened the pot to the point where we cannotdesist . But it is more than that . You see , we do not know what he plans  --  and if we retain our Aspects , he will know we can not be fooled , and he will do something else . Something we perhaps cannotprevent . So this trap of his  --  we decided it was better to fall into it  --  " " With one experienced Aspect he does n't know about ! " Niobe concluded . " To spring his trap  --  and destroy it ! " Lisa smiled . " I knew you would understand . " Niobe mulled it over . She had sworn to have her reckoning with Satan for Cedric 's death , but somehow she had never had a satisfying denouement . She had told herself that just doing her job , as an Aspect of Fate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Luna and Orb was sufficient , since they were integral to the foiling of the Prince of Evil . But how much better it would be to foil Satan directly , personally ! Her mortal life was over anyway . She had nothing left to live for . It was really no contest . " I 'll do it . " Lisa smiled . " We 're so pleased . We know you will do what has to be done . We know that our mortal situations will be protected from evil , with you in charge . " She extended her hand.  |p152Niobe  was taken aback . " Wait ! I did n't mean right this instant ! I have to put my mortal affairs in order  --  " " Lachesis will do that for you , " Lisa assured her . " Before she moves on to her own situation . " Surely she could trust an Aspect of Fate to know the importance of the proper disposition of Earthly affairs ! Especially when it was vital that Satan not know of the change . Niobe took Lisa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experienced twice before . Then she was inside Lisa , looking out out through her eyes . A nondescript middle-aged woman stood before her : the old Lachesis . Good-bye , mortal situation ! Niobe thought with abrupt nostalgia . No life was easy to leave , even a completed one . " Take the body , " Lisa said , and turned it over to her . Niobe stood again in her own form , in different flesh . Her original flesh had been lost when she had become Clotho , so long ago , and when she had returned to mortality she had taken Lisa 's flesh . Her pattern , even to the genes of reproduction , had carried across . Now that flesh was subject to the will and image of the prior Lachesis . Surely Lisa , too , felt nostalgia , knowing that the flesh that had been hers had just passed to a third identity . It was a familiar yet strange business . Niobe shook hands with the woman who had been Lachesis . " I think you already know anything I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I can never thank you enough  --  Lachesis , " the woman said . " Do you know what mortality offers for me now ? " " It 's really not my business  --  " " A title , " the woman exclaimed . " I am in a position to inherit a title and a grand estate in Europe , and be a lady of quality with servantsand functions and responsibilities . I always longed for this and feared it could never come about . As Lachesis I indulged my propensityfor managing things  --  " " That 's a quality of those suitable for that Aspect , " Niobe agreed . " But now it can be real . I mean , mortal . And the estate needs me ; without a person of the blood , it will fall prey to greedy distant claimantsand taxes  --  it would be destroyed . But now it has come to me , if I claim it in time , and I know so well how to manage it ! If I die of some disfiguring disease within twenty years , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Different folk had different dreams , and the right dream was worth one 's life . " Bless you , and prosper , " Niobe told her warmly . " Bless you , wonderful woman ! " the other responded .  |p153Niobe  returned the body to Lisa so that she and Atropos could hid farewell to their companion . It was strange , sharing Fate with the woman who had succeeded her as Clotho , but evidently she had chosen correctly , on that day a quarter-century ago . Lisa had done the job . When the other two were done , they changed to spider form and slid up the web to Purgatory . How quickly it all came back ! Niobe did not for a moment regret her second tenure as a mortal , and she felt a lingering pang for that suddenly lost life  --  but she also felt an abiding joy for her return as an Incarnation . To be an Immortal  --  there was no mortal experience to match it ! The Abode was unchanged : a cocoon , a house made of silk , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threads . Still there was no staff , for the three women of Fate remained too independentto be waited on . There was a reasonable supply of Voidsubstancefor Clotho . Everything was in order . " Now it is my turn , " Lisa said , and started out again . " Already ? " Niobe asked . " But we just got here ! " " Yes  --  to be sure you had your bearings . As you can see , I have arranged things for my replacement ; it will be a fortnight before she has to visit the Void . " She paused . " What an experience , that first time ! " Niobe shrugged , mentally . It was essentially the business of each Aspect to choose her successor , and the time of her own return to mortality . Niobe had become Clotho , in large part , because the prior Clotho had liked her , and now was Lachesis because the three Aspectshad agreed she was needed . She would go along with what had been decided . Clotho descended a thread toward the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you going ? " Niobe asked . " True love , " Lisa answered raptly . " One day last month I was hiking in the mountains when a young man floated down on a flying carpet to ask directions . He had an accent I recognized . You 're from Hungary ! ' I cried . He was taken aback . My parents were , ' he said . My mother was carrying me when they fled during the  --  ' and he shrugged , for in America few understand how it was in Budapest . I 'm from there too , ' I told him , and I spoke to him in our language . Wait ! ' he cried . I am not good at it ! All my life has been here . ' But he understood enough . Now he wants to marry me . He understands about how I am , almost twice his age . We did not tell his mother about that  --  she would not understand  --  so I told her my own mother had told me how it was with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our tongue my own experience as if it were my mother 's  --  and I think it could have been my mother 's , if she had n't died in the in/vasion of our homeland  --  and his mother cried with the memories , and she reminded me so much of mine , I cried too ! I think she wants me to marry her son twice as much as he does ! I will move in with them , and I know I will never have trouble with my in-laws ! " Niobe hated to raise the question , but felt she had to . " Yet you believe this is the work of  --  of the anonymous one  --  to get you out of the way ? " " Yes . Lachesis  --  the one before you  --  verified how that one had nudged that thread to place him flying where I was hiking , so we would meet . So little a thing  --  but though there was manipulation , the person is genuine . There is no great evil in him . The unnamed knows I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not be deceived by fool 's gold ! So the intent may be evil , but the offering is good . It is not for me the evil is intended , but for you . " Yes , surely so . The ways of Satan were devious but effective . But maybe this time the Father of Lies would find himself outmaneuvered , for the Incarnation of Fate was no innocent mortal to be fooled by manipulations of chance . Especially not with a former Aspect returning , with her firsthand knowledge of Satan 's ways . You have a surprise coming , 0 Evil One ! she thought . They came to ground in an unsettled area . A young woman was walking at dusk toward the high cliff that descended to the crashing sea . She was Oriental and quite pretty . Lisa intercepted her . " Where do you go , solitary maiden ? " " What does it matter ? My life is over . " " But you are young and pretty and intelligent , " Lisa protested . " You have much to live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thread . " No , I have nothing to live for , " the girl demurred . " My family has cast me out for not following the old ways , for being too willful and violent , and now I have no family . " Niobe knew that the Oriental cultures could be very strict about their traditions , and that there were sometimes conflicts with the ways of the Occidental world . The girl had probably refused to marry the man the family had chosen for her . Niobe could understand , even though her own arranged marriage had been a good one . She disliked admitting it , but parental judgment did seem to be as good as that of the participants . But America touted itself as the land of the free , and it had become unacceptable for girls to heed the judgment of their elders . There was more to tragedy than lost romance . Amen ! Atropos agreed . " And now you are ready to depart this world ? " Lisa asked . The girl glanced at the cliff . A gust of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have the courage . "  | " I have an alternative . " And Lisa explained about Fate and the role of Clotho . It took the young woman a while to grasp it , understandably , but when she peered over the dark and savage ocean , she decided that this was a better alternative . Atropos took over the body , extended her hand , and it was done . Clotho had changed . Lisa now stood in her physical form , just like herself ; all traces of Oriental heritage had vanished . Niobe had never quite understood the magic that did this , but of course that was n't necessary . Welcome , Clotho , she thought , and the process of education began . They returned to the Abode and relaxed for a few hours . Niobe , as Lachesis , took over the body and contemplated the Tapestry , while Atropos continued to explain things internally to Clotho . The prior Lachesis had left the Tapestry in good order , considering the troubled times , so there was nothing urgent to do at the moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tenure as an Aspect , but now the responsibility was hers , and that was different . She hoped Satan would leave them alone for a few weeks while she got into it  --  and knew he would n't . Next day it was Atropos ' turn . There had been an accident , and her mortal great-grandchildren had become orphans . They would becomewards of the state and be assigned to separate foster homes unless she , their only remaining blood relative , assumed control . They were eleven and nine years old ; Atropos believed she had enough mortal years left in her to get the older one to the age of discretion before she died . She had to do it ; they were her blood kin . Satan did not seem to have arranged this ; rather , he had foreseen the opportunity and arranged for the other two Aspects to leave at the same time Atropos did . If Lachesis had not caught the hint in the Tapestry , Satan 's ploy would have been effective . As it was , no easy time was coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a chance to win . Atropos slid down a thread to the one she had selected . This brought her to a slum area where an old black woman sat in her rocking chair on a rickety porch , watching children play handball in the street . She looked up as Atropos appeared before her . " ' Bout time you got here , " she remarked . Even Atropos was taken aback by this . " You know me ? " " I know you . I was expecting Death , though , not Fate . " " I have come to ask you to take my place . If you do , you will meetDeath only as a business associate . " " I thought he already was . I 've buried more kin than I can count on my hands . " She held up her gnarled spread fingers . " If you take this office , you will cut the threads on the lives of a million times that number . "  | " Somebody 's got to do it . " Atropos turned the body over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Niobe said . " But do not think the job is always easy . " The old woman hardly blinked . " No job worth doing is . " She took the hand . Then the old Atropos was sitting in the rocker , and the new one was with Fate . At that point a child dashed up . " Grandma ! I made a score ! " Then , seeing a stranger in the chair , he skidded to a halt . Niobe gave the body to the new Atropos . " It 's okay , Jimmy , " she said . " She 's just visiting . " " Oh . " Suddenly shy , the boy backed away . " Jimmy , it 's time for me to go away , " the new Atropos said . " You do me a big favor , now , and show this lady to the bus stop . Tell the folks I 'm gone . " " Gone where ? " " Just gone , Jimmy . They 'll understand . " " Okay . " The boy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Atropos away down the street . Niobe took over the body again , changed to spider form , and mounted a thread . Now that 's some trick ! the new Atropos thought . I always squish bugs . " Not anymore , ' ' Niobe said in her spider 's voice . " You will masterthis trick too . " She brought them to the Abode and resumed her human form . " In fact , we had better practice the basic motions right now , " she said . " Because things may get hectic soon . " Hectic ? both others inquired . Quickly Niobe explained how Satan had conspired to get three new Aspects of Fate together . " Now I am a retread , " she concluded . " I had several decades experience as Clotho , ending twenty-five years ago . We hope Satan does n't know that . " She felt free to name the Prince of Evil , here in the Abode , because it was secure from uninvitedintrusion . Each Incarnation was supreme within his or her home . " So we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reassure him , and he may be careless . But we have to take care that we do n't do too much damage . These are human lives we are manipulating , remember . " They practiced using the mouth to speak , assuming the spider form , climbing the web , and using the travel-threads to move about rapidly , so that any of the three could get about well enough . Then Niobe explained the three jobs : how Clotho spun the threads of life , Lachesismeasured them , and Atropos cut them to their lengths . " I hardly know my own job , " she confessed . " So I really am learning too . I'mp157likely to mismeasure the lengths I need for particular parts of the Tapestry , which will result in some of what the mortals take to be odd coincidences . We wo n't have to pretend , to make thinks look awkward . " " But we could use a real bad blunder to start off , " Atropos concluded . She seemed to have a ready grasp of the essentials ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She had no mortal experience at this , so was clumsy . She had been selected as much for availability and militant spirit as for dexterity , for the notice had been short . Niobe had to guide her carefully , and even so , the thread was somewhat loose and irregular . But she could do it , however slowly . Now it was Atropos ' turn to try some cutting . Niobe measured a thread , then turned the body over to the old woman . Atropos took the little scissors and snipped one end , then the other . " Oops , " she said . " I cut it too long ! " She cut a small bit off the end . " There  --  that 's about right , now . " They prepared about twenty threads , snipping freely to trim them down to size . " When we get more experienced , " Niobe said as she took them to the Tapestry for placement , " we 'll do them wholesale . There are far too many lives on Earth for us to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they fell out . That was funny . " They always seemed to grow right in place for the Lachesis I knew in the old days . " She recovered a thread and set it in place again  --  and it fell out again . " I do n't remember her having to tie them in . " " Maybe I spun them wrong , " Clotho said nervously . " I do n't think so . But we can try some new ones . " Clotho spun some more , and Niobe measured , and Atropos snipped , still having trouble getting the lengths exactly right ; more snippets fell to the floor . But the new threads also refused to stay in place . They could n't figure out what was wrong . The floor of the Abode was littered with snippets , but no threads had been successfully emplacedin the Tapestry . There was a peremptory knock on the door . Niobe took the body and went to answer it . Thanatos stood there , more forbidding in his hooded cloak and skull than she recalled him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Truly , he was Death Incarnate . " What are you up to ? " he demanded . Niobe was taken aback . " I 'm just trying to do my job , " she said . Thanatos ' square and bony eye-sockets stared darkly at her . " You have changed . "  | " We have all changed , " Niobe said , and had Clotho and Atropos show their forms briefly . " But we 're having some trouble  --  " " Trouble ! " Thanatos exclaimed , striding into the Abode . Beyond him , outside , Niobe saw his fine pale horse , the one she had ridden on , back at the outset . " Twenty-six babies needlessly dead ! " " Babies  --  dead ? " Niobe asked . " I have n't emplaced any threads , let alone cut them short ! " " No ? What do you think these are ? " Thanatos demanded , stoopingto pick up a handful of snippets . He was angry , and he frightened her even though she knew he was no threat to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Thanatos roared . " You do n't trim lives from the front ends ! " Niobe fell back against the silken wall , stunned . " The  --  the front ends ? " Thanatos held up one of the full-length threads . " Here is a Thread of Life , " he said scathingly . " Here is the front , here the rear . When you cut off a segment from the rear  --  " he made a snipping motion with two bone-fingers  --  " you shorten that life by that amount . When you cut it off at the front , you shorten that life by this amount . " And he dropped the whole thread to the floor . " Leaving only this . " He held up two fingers , almost touching each other . " Oh , no ! " Niobe exclaimed with horror . " We cut them off after days  --  or hours ! " " And twenty-six babies died , poisoned in the hospital , " Thanatos continued grimly . " Because a dietician got the wrong container and put salt in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a tragic accident , but I knew it was your handiwork . I had to take those babies ! " His fury fairly shook the Abode . Niobe burst into tears . She was middle-aged , but it made no difference . She was too appalled to react any other way . It was Atropos who took over the body and the situation . " Do n't chew her out , Death , " she snapped . " I did it , and I 'm mortified . I did n't know  --  and I sure as hell wo n't do it again ! " Thanatos looked at her , their situation registering . " All three  --  new ? " he asked . " No experience ? " " Not exactly , " Atropos began . Do n't tell him ! Niobe urged . If he knows , Satan will know ! " But all three of us have changed in the last few days , " Atropos said . " And as you can plainly see , not one of us is experienced in her role . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Thanatos asked . " You lose your continuity ! "  | " Now he tells us , " Atropos said . " This morning I was sitting in my rocker , waiting for you to come haul my soul away . Now I 'm apologizing to you for messing up . " Thanatos relaxed . " I was new , too , last year , and your forerunners helped me greatly . I know how it is ; I made mistakes too . I 'm sorry I ranted at you . Let 's see if we can work this out . " He sat on the silk couch and drew back his hood . The face of a rather ordinary young man emerged . Atropos did a double take . " You 're a living man ! " Thanatos smiled . " They did n't tell you ? I suppose they did n't think of it , with all of you changing so rapidly . Yes , all the Incarnations are living people , frozen at the ages when they assumed their offices . We are the temporary Immortals . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Not until you return to mortality  --  which you will do only by your own choice , unlike me . " " You 're different ? " There was a lot Niobe had not yet told the other two , owing to the press of time . She kept quiet ; this was actually convenient , as she did not have to finesse any questions about herself . " I continue until my successor kills me . Then he will assume my office . " " But then you 're not immortal ! " " Oh , I am immortal  --  until I grow careless . No person or creature can harm me , not even Satan himself , as long as I am careful . The only one who can kill me is my successor  --  and even he will fail unless I let him . My cloak is invulnerable to natural attack , and my person to supernatural menace . But I can not step down alive , unlike you . " " That must be a horror ! " Atropos exclaimed . " No , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contemplated as a mortal . " At this Clotho perked up , mentally ; she knew about that sort of thing . " But is n't your life sterile ? " Atropos asked . " No hell-raising , no gambling , no women ? " He laughed . " You do n't think much of young men , do you ! " " I think a lot of them ! I 've known a few myself , when I was young and sexy . But I know their nature . A man without a woman is hellbentfor trouble . " Thanatos smiled . " Well , I have a woman . She 's mortal , but she knows my nature . Her name is Luna Kaftan . I love her and I guaranteeshe will not die before her time . I ca n't marry her , because I have no legal mortal identity ; I 'm listed as deceased . But I 'll always be with her . " Niobe was glad she did n't have the body now ; she would have given herself away . She had forgotten , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Thanatos ! As a mortal , she had disapproved ; now , suddenly , she approved . This seemed to be a fine young man , committed to his role . He could indeed protect Luna from death itself . That portion of the prophecy had turned out to be much more positive than anticipated . But Atropos was learning rapidly . " Suppose I  --  I never would , mind you  --  suppose I cut your girl friend 's thread short ? " Thanatos ' hood was away from his head , but a shadow of the skull seemed to pass across his features , and his skin took on the hue of bone . He was , indeed , Death . " You did that once before  --  your prior person did . Satan had forced it . I refused to take her . You do not end the lives , you merely schedule them . Only when I take their souls do they actually die . As I took the souls of those twenty-six babies . I had to do it ; their bodies were ravaged and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood aside and let them drift to Heaven . But I am the one in charge of that , and by my decree a dying person can live indefinitely , regardless of his suffering . We Incarnations have to cooperate , or it becomes untenable . " Atropos nodded . " I thought it was something like that . We wo n't kill any more babies , that 's for sure ! Let 's run through it now and make sure we 've got it right . " Clotho took the body and spun more thread . Then Niobe measured it , and Atropos cut it carefully , only once at each end . Then Niobe took it to the Tapestry and laid it in place where she knew it belonged . This time it took . The thread anchored , and extended into the fuzzy future portion of the Tapestry . " That 's the way , " Thanatos agreed . He drew his hood back into place . " I must go ; I have business elsewhere . If you have doubts about anything , check with me or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chronos , especially , must work with you closely ; he lives backward , so he knows the future , not the past . " Thanatos departed , riding into the sky on his pale horse . The three Aspects of Fate collapsed onto the couch . That had been some ses-sion ! But Clotho had a question : if Chronos knew the future , would n't he know about Niobe 's prior experience in office ? " Not if we do n't tell him  --  some time in the future , " Niobe said . " I think we had better just forget about my past and carry on in the present . But about Chronos  --  there may be something else you should know , Clotho . " " What 's that ? " " He  --  in the past  --  he has been very close to us . Especially to Clotho . " " Friendship is good , is n't it ? " the girl asked , perplexed .  | " Lovers . " Clotho was silent . Niobe was not sure what was going through her mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they chose not to . " The way I see it , " Atropos said , " this is n't our mortal body anymore . This body must have been through a lot we do n't know about . " " Yes , " Niobe agreed . " So maybe it does n't matter too much what we do with it , as long as we do our jobs right . " Still Clotho did n't comment . Niobe remembered how difficult this particular aspect of being an Aspect had been for her , at first . Well , an accommodation would be achieved , in time . Time ? Chronos ! They fixed themselves a meal from the available supplies and lay down for a rest . Then they worked out a regular schedule of operations  --  whichAspect would take what shift , which would be backup , and which would sleep . The body itself was indefatigable ; it needed neither rest nor sleep , but the minds within it did . Fate , however tenuously , was back in business.  |p162But  next day the axe , figuratively , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because she needed his advice and assistance on the placementof specific threads . The Tapestry tended to follow its natural pattern , but left entirely alone it would soon develop rents and tangles as threads got crossed . She had to set the threads properly , and timing as well as placement was essential . For example , when a marriage occurred , the threads of the man and woman intersected  --  but if the intersection occurred before the mundane ceremony , a new thread could be started before the term of marriage , which could be awkward . Chronos could check such things directly ; indeed , he knew the timing of every significant human interaction , though most of the routine was left to his staff . Fate , too , had a staff for the routine , but she could not afford to leave the important matters to underlings . But first came the introductions . " I realize that you have known us for some time , " Niobe said . " But from our viewpoint , this is our first encounter . We are all new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and all inexperienced in our duties . So allow us to present ourselves , and for you this will be our parting . I 'm sure you will find our precedessorscompetent . " " Ah , is it that time already ? " Chronos asked . " I have seen two of you change  --  " " Please , we prefer not to know , " Niobe said quickly . " Of course . Let me only say that all three of you have been kind to me in my past , and I have a deep respect for you and shall be sorry to see you go . I hope I get along as well with your replacements . "  | " I 'm sure you will , " Niobe said , and flashed through the Clotho and Atropos Aspects for him before returning to Lachesis . " But since none of us go back to that time as Aspects , we have no firsthand information . We 're all new , and we are making embarrassing mis-takes . " " Yes , I know , " Chronos said sympathetically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead  --  Thanatos was in a fury ! " Niobe said . " Oh , pardon . I thought you were referring to the UN incident . " " The UN incident ? " Niobe asked blankly . " But of course that has n't happened yet , for you , just as the dead babies have n't for me . Sorry I mentioned it . " If we 're about to blunder again . . . Atropos thought . Ask him about it , Clotho concluded . They had not yet gotten their shifts down pat , so all three were awake for this interview . They were three quite different individuals , but the disaster of the babies had unified them in their horror . " Please do n't apologize , " Niobe said . " We are eager to avoid futureblunders . If it is not a violation of your ethics , we would like to know more about it . " Chronos smiled . " Incarnations do n't have ethics in that sense ; all of us do what we have to do , or we leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After all , as I believe you explained to me , Lachesis , when I first assumed my office twenty years hence , it is our common purpose to balk the machinations of Satan and promote those of God . The UN incident was very simple , but it had phenomenalconsequences . It seems that someone sneaked a psychic stink bomb into the United Nations complex in New York . When it detonated , the  --  " " Psychic stink bomb ? " Niobe asked . She remembered the time Luna and Orb , as children , had obtained a physical stink bomb , one of the type called " little stinkers , " and set it off in her kitchen . The stench had taken days to clear . Girls would be girls , she knew , but she had made them scrub floor , ceiling , and walls anyway . They had been less mischievous thereafter  --  but their reputations in school had escalated dramatically for a while . " It generated an emotional atmosphere that no one could tolerate , " Chronos said , suppressing an illicit smile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States was expelled from the UN and the headquarterswas moved to Moscow  --  " " Moved to Moscow ! " Niobe exclaimed indignantly . " Well , you see , the international diplomats had some difficulty appreciating the humor of the situation , " Chronos said . " Though I understand that both the Soviet leaders and the American conser/vatives suffered some private belly laughs . It was of course impossible to conduct normal business  --  " " Satan 's work ! " Niobe cried with dismay . But both Atropos and Clotho were stifling their own amusement . " Naturally , " Chronos agreed . " It was amazing how much profit Satan reaped from that simple incident . There was a steady attrition in world harmony and a resurgence of evil . Mars was kept quite busy managing the wars that later developed  --  " " We 've got to stop it ! " Niobe said firmly . Atropos and Clotho settled down enough to agree ; this was evidently a major ploy by Satan to generate disharmony . " I 'm sure the beginnings of the tangle are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's take a look . " Niobe had learned how to generate the image of the Tapestry , so that she could place the threads properly . She caused it to manifest now . The pattern seemed to be in order . " If you will permit me , " Chronos said . He lifted his Hourglass ; the sand changed color , and the Tapestry abruptly slid forward . Niobe kept her face straight despite the amazement of the other two Aspects ; she knew that Chronos had the power to affect an image she had generated . The Hourglass was truly the most marvelous of instruments . " Five days hence , your time , " he explained . Niobe looked . There was a monstrous tangle that resulted in a distortion of the entire Tapestry . Atropos and Clotho were as appalled as she was ; they would never get that back in proper order once it occurred ! " We 've got to stop it ! " Niobe repeated . " Once it happens , it 's too late ; we have to see that it never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But if we prevent it , and you 've already seen it hap-pen  --  " " Do n't be concerned . I am immune from paradox . I change events all the time , literally , to put right what goes wrong . I had quite a campaign with Satan , let me assure you , back when I started ! I had to traverse eternity itself to get my bearings back . If you change it , you change it , that 's all ; I will remember it merely as one of the alternate timelines . " " Then we shall , " Niobe said , relieved . " If that bomb goes off in five days , it means we have four days to track down who is to do it , and cut his thread out of the Tapestry before he does , or reroute it . Then the notorious ' UN incident ' will never happen ! " " It will never happen , " Chronos agreed . " And we will be spared the embarrassment of a major tangle , " Niobe finished . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to struggle with . Experienced Aspects could handle it , but he does n't think we can . "  --   | " A fair assessment , " Chronos agreed . " Satan is devious in the extreme ; one must always be alert for his finesses . " " We 'll go home and see what we can do . " " Remember , " Chronos said . " If you need the assistance of other Incarnations , simply ask . Any of us will be glad to do what we can , especially knowing that you are presently inexperienced . " " We shall , " she agreed and rode her thread away . At the Abode they held a council of war . " That tangle is impenetrable , " Niobe said . " A veritable Gordian Knot . But we know that the cause is simple : someone has to plant that bomb and get away so as not to be contaminated when it goes off . The thread of life of that mortal has to be in our Tapestry , here ; all we have to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gazed at the Tapestry through her eyes . " There are so many threads , so intricately meshed ! " Clotho said . " We could search for months and never find the right one ! " " Needle in a haystack , " Atropos agreed . " Woman , you poked me into a bigger picklement than I knew when you signed me up for Fate ! I love it ! " " Too bad we do n't have a computer , " Clotho said . " There 's the Purgatory Computer , " Niobe said . " It should store everything . " " Well , get moving , gal ! " Atropos said . " I hope you know how to work it , because I sure do n't ! " Niobe got moving . She entered the Purgatory front office and asked for time with the Computer . Computers had not been widely used during her term as Clotho , but Purgatory was evidently keeping up with the times . She had not had a lot of experience , but understood the general principle . Fortunately , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ screen flashed when she turned it on . HOW MAY I INFORM YOU ? She started to punch the keys , awkwardly . SIMPLY SPEAK TO ME , the screen advised . Oh . " I need to figure out a tangle , " Niobe said . " I 'm new at this , and  --  " IS THERE A KEY THREAD ? " Yes . But I need to locate it  --  and there are millions to choose from . " CONDUCT A GLOBAL SEARCH . WHAT ARE YOUR DEFINING CRITERIA ? " Well , it 's some person who will visit the United Nations complex in New York , on or before a particular date . " PROVIDE THE DATE . Niobe provided it . The screen became a blur of lines , then cleared . THREE THOUSAND , TWO HUNDRED , FIFTY-SIX THREADS REMAIN.  |p166Well  , that was progress . " Can we get it down to a smaller number  --  suchas half a dozen ? " PROVIDE FURTHER DEFINITION . Niobe pondered . The other Aspects helped . Just how big is that contraption  --  a psychic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to carry in a psychic stink-bomb potent enough to foul the entire complex , " Niobe said . " If you happen to know how big such a package would be  --  " The screen flickered . If Niobe had n't known better , she would have suspected that the machine was laughing . A PSYCHIC STINK BOMB ? The flickering became more pronounced . " Yes . Someone is going to leave it to detonate in the UN complex , and America will be expelled from the UN and the headquarters will move to Moscow . " TO MOSCOW ? Now jags of yellow showed at the edges of the screen , and wiggly music sounded in the background . " Now do n't shake off your stand , " Niobe cautioned it , annoyed . " All I need to know is  --  " With a seeming effort , the computer got itself under control . ONETHOUSAND , EIGHT HUNDRED , FOURTEEN THREADS REMAIN . Still too many . Maybe motive , Clotho suggested . Does it know who might want to humiliate the UN ? " Can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason to dislike the UN ? " The screen flickered again , and the words STINK BOMB showed fleetingly , as if an illicit thought were passing through the machine 's randomaccess memory . Then it settled down again . SEVEN HUNDRED , EIGHTY-THREE THREADS REMAIN . Still way too high ! Get practical , woman , Atropos thought . Ask how many have access to such a bomb . They ca n't be a dime a dozen . " Eliminate those who have no reasonable access to such a bomb , " Niobe said . FOUR THREADS REMAIN . Jackpot ! Atropos thought . One day to a thread ! Never thought all my time running down vandals would pay off like this ! Evidently grandmothers did learn useful skills in the ghetto ! Atroposhad been the one to recognize opportunity as a defining characteristic . " Please identify those four threads , " Niobe said , relieved . Four names appeared on the screen . Niobe made a note of them . " Thank you , Computer , " she said . YOU ARE WELCOME , FATE , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the words STINK BOMB flickered once more . The machine seemed unable to clear that concept from its banks . The devices ofp167Purgatory seemed to have more personality than those of the mortal realm . You 've got to admit that of Satan has a certain sense of humor , Atropos thought . " Yes , I 'm sure he 's laughing as he humiliates us , " Niobe agreed shortly . Mirth was indeed a characteristic of the Father of Lies . Back at the Abode , they reviewed the four threads . " We may do better if we approach our own kind , " Clotho suggested . " To ascertainwhether they are guilty or innocent . " " We do n't want to snip any innocent threads , " Atropos agreed . Niobe sighed . " True . We do n't want to make a mistake . Very well , I will verify one of the white ones today . " She looked at the two white threads . One was for an old man , the other for a middle-aged woman who " Great balls of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Satanist ! " There was a prime suspect , certainly . " I do n't want to go charging into a Satanist shrine ! " Niobe said . " Let 's leave that one till last , " Clotho suggested . Niobe was glad to agree . She knew of the Satanists by reputation , but even as an immortal she did not want to get involved with them . The other white thread was ordinary . The old man was a retired carpet salesman named Henry Clogg . That was about as much as she could get in detail . Otherwise she could have solved the riddle of the stink bomber without leaving the Abode . That , of course , was what Satan was counting on : Fate 's present inability to read the threads aptly . This much of Satan 's strategy was working . She rode a thread down to the old man 's home . It was midmorning here , and he was out working on his little garden . Niobe approached . " Hello , I 'm looking for Mr. Clogg . " " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Niobe found herself blushing . It had been years since anyone had called her that . She wished she had n't let herself run down so much in the last few years ; she was a good thirty pounds overweight and sagged in places that had n't existed in her youth . Now , as an Incarnation , she was fixed in this form ; dieting would not improve her figure . Of course she could change her appearance by means of magic or physics , as Lisa had done , but she preferred to live with herself with neither spell nor girdle . However she might conceal it , the flab was still there . Clotho had an easier time of it ; all she needed was minimal magic to shift hair color and length , skin shade , and slant of eyes ; she would be an attractive young woman regardless . She focused on her mission : to discover whether this man was likely to be the bomber . " Mr. Clogg , I  --  " " Call me Henry , cutie . Just plain old Henry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "  |p168Little  did he know ! She realized that he must call every woman cutie ; it had no significance . It embarrassed her almost as much to blush for nothing as to blush for cause . " Urn , Henry , I  --  1 understand you are planning to visit the United Nations complex soon . " He plunged his trowel into the earth so that the handle was left pointing up so that it would n't get lost , and climbed to his feet , brushinghimself off . " Oh , you heard about that ! Yeah , my son 's treating me to a two-day tour , and I guess that 's on the list . Me , I do n't know much about it , and do n't much care . But he figures the old man 's got to do some things before he kicks off , so that 's it . Do n't want no ignorant louts in Hell , I guess . " " Oh , you 're not going to die soon , Henry ! " The man grinned . " I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know that . I wish he 'd save his money ; going to need it soon enough when I get surgery . " " Surgery ? " " Got this here tumor on my butt , " he confided . Like some old people , he was not at all reticent to discuss intimate details of physiologywith strangers . He seemed not to question her presence at all . " It 's a nuisance , but it 's benign . Just a pain in the rump . " He laughed . " All those years I talked about that sort of thing , and now I 've really got it ! Good , deep cushion takes care of it , but my son , he worries , says I got to have it out , and that means surgery and the lab and all , which is a real pain in the assets , just to prove what I already know . My son needs that money for his family ; I do n't want him throwing it away to doctors for what I do n't need anyway . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " No , " Niobe said . " I  --  " " Got an accent , do n't you ! You 're Irish ! You ever been by to kiss the Blarney Stone ? Have a seat ; you do n't have any boil on your bottom , do you ? " " Uh , no , " Niobe said , taking the deck chair he offered . Henry , true to his word , had a chair with a fluffy cushion on it . He eased himself onto it , wincing . Evidently the tumor was more painful than he cared to admit . " Well , what can I do for you , cutie ? " he asked . " It 's about the United Nations , " she said cautiously . " There 's a rumor that there 's going to be trouble , and  --  " " I told you , I do n't care about the UN . Just a bunch of lefties soaking up our tax dollars , if you ask me . We 'd be better off out of it , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russia or somewhere . " He 's a candidate , all right ! Atropos thought . " But the United Nations is perhaps the major force for peace in the world , " Niobe protested . " It represents a forum for dialogue  |p169between  most of the nations , so that they can talk problems out instead of going to war . It would be disaster if that forum were eliminated . Henry shrugged . " As far as I can see , they mostly talk about how terrible America is . While they take our money . " He 's got a point , Atropos thought . " That 's a necessary freedom of speech , " Niobe said . " Words will not hurt this country , but bombs will . It is far better to  --  " He nodded . " That 's right , is n't it ! You know about bombs , over there ! I can tell you , I would n't live in Ireland today if you paid me to ! " " Well , it 's really not like that , " Niobe said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we only read about it in the newspapers . The same as you read about crime in the big cities . The countryside is as peacefuland pretty as any in the world . " He nodded again . " You care about your land . I like that . But you know , if they have bombs going off over there , how come they are n't talking in the UN ? I mean the IRS and  --  " " The IRA , " Niobe said . " What 's the difference ? Over here they call it the IRS , and it does to your wallet what those bombers over there do to your buildings . I wish they 'd all get lost ! " She saw her opportunity . " You do n't like bombers ? " " I do n't like bombers , " he agreed emphatically . " Except for maybe the UN building . Maybe that could use a bomb ! " Aha ! Atropos thought . " You ca n't mean that , Henry ! " Niobe protested . " If the UN were bombed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considered . " Could be . And we ca n't afford another war , that 's for sure . Could n't afford the last one , when it comes to that . You know why inflation 's so bad ? Because we 're still trying to pay off the last war ! But still , it 's tempting . If we could have maybe a false alarm , just to make the UN move out  --  " " Like a stink bomb ? " Niobe asked . He laughed so hard he winced from the motion of his posterior . " Sure ! That 'd be great ! Make that bad smell literal ! " Niobe experienced mixed emotions . On the one hand she was relieved to have confirmation of his guilt , for it solved her problem of research . On the other , she hated to do what she knew she would have to do : have Atropos cut his thread short . Now that she had talked with Henry Clogg , she liked him ; he was at least an honest man . It would be a shame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain , Clotho warned . Many people will not do what they say.  |p170Niobe  grasped at that straw . " Henry , if someone were to come and give you a stink bomb that you could sneak into the UN complex when you go there , so that after you leave it would mess up everything and get the United States of America expelled from  --  " " Hey , wait a minute ! " he said . " Why would anyone do that ? A bomb that strong would cost a lot of money ! " " Yes . But let 's say Satan hoped to promote discord in the world , so he brought you a  --  " Henry scowled . " Satan ? Listen , cutie , I 'm a God-fearing man , no matter what I say about going to Hell ! I would n't touch the Devil with a ten-foot spell ! " " Well , he would n't give you his identity , of course . He might come in the form of a businessman , offering to pay you enough money to cover your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you will just take a package to the UN complex , hide it from the guards , and leave it there where it wo n't be noticed , in a closet or somewhere . " He stared ahead , pondering . " Satan , eh ? If he wants to be rid of the UN , I 'm not sure I do ! " " Well , as I said , he would n't say he was  --  " " What do I want , taking money from strangers ? " he demanded righteously . " Lug a big suitcase around on the tour ? I do n't need any part of that ! " " You mean you would n't stink-bomb the UN if you had the chance ? " " Not now that I 've thought about it ! When you really get down to it , stink bombs are kid stuff , not that funny . And I sure would n't do it for tainted money ! If the Devil wants it done , let him get someone else to do his dirty work ! Me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even if I wo n't find most of my friends there . " Niobe felt mixed relief and regret again , this time reversed . Henry Clogg was not the one after all , and she was glad she had not decided to cut the thread of an innocent man . But it meant they would have to interview the others , and that the job had not yet been done . " Say  --  you want some sherry ? " Henry asked . " Well , no , I  --  " " I do n't get much company these days , " he said . " It 'll be good to share it . My wife , bless her soul , she liked it . It 's been three years now  --  " His face turned sad . " I 'll have some sherry , " Niobe agreed . He eased himself to his feet and went indoors to fetch the bottle and glasses . He 's a good of geezer , Atropos thought approvingly . Reminds me some of my old man , before he died , except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  " Niobe murmured.  |p171Sherry  is n't drinking , woman ! Atropos thought firmly . It 's socializing . I do n't think the other interviews will be this easy , Clotho thought . Niobe just nodded . Henry returned with the sherry . Niobe sipped the golden wine , satisfied for the moment to relax . It was nice being company , howeverextemporaneously . This was the way she should have been with Cedric , instead of drinking too much . Alcohol was an evil only when abused  --  as with so many pleasures . " My son 's already bought me a ticket for the carpet to New York , " Henry remarked . " That gripes me some . See , I was a carpet salesman , when I worked . We had some pretty fancy models , too . You know how those automobile companies always say a carpet 's no good in the rain ? Do n't you believe it ! We have models with canopies ; no way you 'd get wet on one of those . Could even close it in tight and pressurize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pollute the air the way gasoline does . " She listened , and nodded agreement . She was sorry when the sherry was finished , and she had to go . " Come again sometime ! " Henry told her cheerfully . " I will , " she promised . She intended to do that , when she had time free . They returned to the Abode and considered . " One down , three to go , " Atropos said . " Who do we tackle next ? " " Well , we have a young black woman , an Oriental martial artist , and the Satanist . " " Let 's take care of the easy one first , " Atropos said . " That 's mine  --  the black girl . " " But let 's rest first , " Clotho said . " We want to be fresh so we do n't make mistakes . " The others agreed . Also , there were some routine threads to spin , place , and cut ; there was no point in letting the job get behind . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Next morning , New York area time , Atropos assumed the body and made her first solo trip along the thread down to the realm of the mortals . The girl was at home , flirting with two boys . She was about fifteen , the boys older . Atropos burst in upon them like a scourge from Purgatory . " What 's these boys doing here , girl ? " she demanded , glaring about . The girl looked stricken , and the boys abashed . " You 're not ' sposed to have company at home alone , you know that ! If your grandmaw knew  --  " " Grandma 's dead , " the girl said defensively.  | " She 'd roll over twice in her grave ! " Atropos continued without pause . " And if your maw knew  --  " The girl gave a little squeal of terror . " She 'd have your li'l black hide hung out on the line to cool ! " Atropos said , fixing her with a deadly stare . " Ai n't that right , girl ! " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Now scat ! " She took a menacing step toward them . The two banged into each other in their haste to exit . " And if I see you two out here again , I 'll take the cane to you myself ! " she called after their fleeing forms . How did you know they were n't supposed to be here ? Niobe thought . We did n't read that in the thread ! " I know boys , " Atropos muttered . " And I know girls . Moment I saw their faces , I knew what they were up to . " She smiled privately . " Same thing I was up to , at that age . Made me a grandma sooner than I needed . " She turned back to the girl , who was trying to recover her poise . " Who are you ? " the girl demanded . " You ai n't my ma ! You ca n't tell me what to do ! " " I 'm a friend of your grandmaw , girl , " Atropos said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're going straight , so I 'm checking you now . I can tell you , I do n't much like what I 'm seeing ! You going hog-wild here  --  why are n't you in school ? " " I 'm in second shift ! " the girl protested . " It do n't start for two hours . " Atropos rolled her eyes skyward . " Lord , I do n't know if I can do the job in two hours . " Then she fixed on the girl again . " You 're in big trouble , child ! " " Listen , old woman , you got no business coming in here like you owned the place ! I can do anything I want . Leave me alone ! " Atropos sighed . " I see we 're going to have to do it the hard way . I 'm going to have to enchant you . " " You do n't have no magic ! " the girl said . " You ca n't  --  " Atropos caught her by the arm and flung a thread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hang of thread manipulation very quickly . " I do n't like backtalk , girl ! " She slid up the thread , carrying the girl with her . The girl screamed as they passed through the wall and sailed into the sky . " Let me go ! Let me go ! " Atropos glanced down . The rooftops were already receding below . " You sure , girl ? If I let you go now , you 'll drop like a stone . " The girl considered that and was quiet . Atropos slid on up to the cloudbank that defined Purgatory , then paused . " Now I want you to come clean with me , girl . If you lie to me , I 'll drop you right out of this cloud ! "  |p173The  girl was daunted . " What are you ? " she demanded . " Just someone interested in what 's right . Now talk , or I 'll turn into a big spider and eat you . " Still the girl resisted . " You ca n't ! " Atropos assumed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to scramble through the cloud substance . Atropos changed back , " Change your mind , girl ? " " I di n't mean nothing wrong ! " the girl babbled . " I di n't even know what it was ! This guy tells me here , just sniff this , it 'll make you feel good , so I sniffed it , and in a little bit I felt like I was floating right off the floor ! " She looked down nervously . " Only not like this ! " " Do n't sniff anything like that again ! " Atropos told her sternly . " That stuff 'll be the death of you ! " " I wo n't ! " the girl promised . The vision of the huge spider had finally convinced her that Atropos meant business . " How are you doing in school ? " " Well , you know how it is  --  " " Sure I know , girl ! You 've got better things to do than study , right ? Figure you 'll just slide through , then make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you 'll lock yourself in the ghetto all your life , same as your maw , same as your grandmaw ! Same as me ! You want to be dependent on a man for everything you need ? It 'll cost you , girl ! A man always takes his payment in kind . You want to make it on your own , then you can look about and see what you want from a man . Then you can put your own price on it , and that 's not money . What 're you doing in school ? " " Not enough , " the girl admitted . " They take you on any field trips ? " The girl brightened . " Sure  --  there 's this New York trip coming up . We 're going there in a bus , see the sights  --  " " Something I 've got to tell you about that , girl . This man may come , maybe offer you money or something to sniff , just to take something to the UN building . Know what you tell him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You tell him to go to Hell ! " Atropos cried . " You do n't take a thing to New York ! You just go and learn all you can , so you can write up a good paper on it when you get home . " " That 's all ? Just tell him  --  ? " " That 's all . That , and do your homework . You have n't  --  ? " " Not yet , " the girl agreed faintly . " Well , we 've still got an hour . I 'll help you this time , but after this you do it on your own , get your grades up , you hear ? No more lip to your teachers ! So your grandmaw wo n't roll over . " Again the girl shook her head , offering no resistance.  |p174Atro|pos  took her back down the thread and into the house . They got out the homework and discussed it . Atropos was not conversant with the technical material , but Niobe and Clotho thought the answers at her , so she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collaborativeeffort . By the time the girl left for school , they were satisfied that not only had they eliminated her as a potential carrier for the stink bomb , they had set her on a much better course of life than she would have followed otherwise . " The world needs more aggressive grandmothers , " Atropos remarked as they returned to the Abode . The other two could only agree.  |p175As  they considered the next case , they had misgivings . The thread of the Oriental man showed him to be age thirty , and a significant force within his culture . They could not simply cut his thread ; that would lead to serious complications in the Tapestry , not as bad as those stemming from the stink bomb , but still well worth avoiding . They would have to talk him out of it  --  and Niobe was learning to read the threads well enough , now , to know that this would not be easy . For one thing , there was a kink in the thread that indicated somethingof extreme significance had touched it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the man had accepted , how could they stop him without cutting his thread ? Clotho assumed the body . " I will try , " she said simply . She pointed the distaff , extended the thread , and slid down it to the man 's location . Again , it was morning , in the state of New Jersey , and he was at his place of business . This was a dojo , or martial arts establishment . We should have guessed , Niobe thought . His name is Samurai . " Which means Warrior , " Clotho murmured . " A pretentious title ! " She opened the door and entered . There was a desk inside with a girl in a gi , or martial arts uniform . " You wish to join for the course ? " she inquired politely . " No , " Clotho said . " I wish to speak to Samurai . " The girl smiled . " The Master does not sign up students . But in class he will give you the same attention he does all students , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an advanced class and receive special instruction . " She eyed Clotho appraisingly . " Of course that is more expensive and requires special dedication . " " I do n't wish to be a student , " Clotho insisted . " I have more personal business with the man . " The girl studied her again . Suddenly Niobe was aware of the appearance of their youngest Aspect . She was well dressed  --  clothing in the Abode was of the highest quality , fashioned of genuine silk , and fitted with magical perfection  --  and was an extremely wellformedwoman to begin with . She was a person to be noticed more than passingly . " I will inquire , " the girl said and touched a button . In a moment she received an answer . She glanced up . " Take the hall to the left , through the curtain . Oh  --  and remove your shoes before you enter the office . He 's very fussy about that . " " Thank you . " Clotho walked down the hall , then paused to remove her dainty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The office was like a Japanese garden , with decorative plants and Oriental statuary all around , and a broad mat covering the floor . At the far side , seated on a slightly elevated dais , was a handsome man in a resplendent gi , almost a robe . Clotho stood bemused at the entrance . " Oh , it 's beautiful ! " she breathed . " I have never been to Japan , but  --  " " Come forward , " the man said . " Do not be afraid of the tatami . " She stepped with her stocking feet onto the mat , which was soft but firm . " Samurai , I want to talk to you about  --  " " Wait , " he said peremptorily , and she paused in place . " Turn about , woman . " Clotho hesitated , then turned around . The man got up , seeming to flow effortlessly to his feet . He strode to a curtained closet in one wall , moving like a lithe panther . He brought out a folded kimono . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want you properly garbed , " he said . " Go to the changing chamberthere . " He gestured at a door . " Put this on . Then we shall talk . " " Samurai , I do n't know what you think I 'm here for  --  " " Not for classes , " he said . " Not for business . So you mean to bea geisha . " " A geisha ! " she exclaimed indignantly . What 's a geisha ? Atropos asked . A Japanese entertainment-girl , high-class , Niobe replied . Oh , so that 's what they call them , over there ! We call them whores . It 's not the same  --  Niobe started , but then external events interruptedthem . " You had another intention ? " Samurai was saying.  |p177Clotho  switched to Japanese , spewing out a minor torrent of words . Neither Niobe nor Atropos understood that language , but they got the gist from her mind ; she was calling him , in eloquent idiom , a male sexist pig . Oopsy ! Niobe thought . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admiringly . Samurai 's face turned grim . He took a step toward Clotho . She spun about and ran for the curtained door . She plunged through , paused to pick up her shoes , and froze . A man was charging down the hall toward her . She turned again and plunged back through the curtain . Samurai was there . She flung her shoes at him . He caught one and dodged the other ; he had marvelous reflexes . She dodged to the side and ran across the room . Samurai followed . Clotho reached out , grabbed a potted cactus , whirled , and hurled it at his head . This time she scored . The clay pot shattered between his eyes , the dirt spreading across his face . I wish she had n't done that ! Niobe thought . She 's one hair-trigger gal ! Atropos responded . Maybe we 'd better just thread on out of here . We ca n't ; she 's got the body . You mean we ca n't take over if we need to ? Not until she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us at the moment . Atropos mentally shook her head . Been forty years since the last time I got raped . Going to be about forty seconds till the next time ! A mortal ca n't rape an Incarnation ! Niobe protested . You sure about that ? Niobe considered . No . I know no mortal can hurt us , but I 'm not sure if rape counts as hurting . It may be just just an interaction , no blood shed . No blood for me , no blood for you  --  but what about her ? Again Niobe considered . She 's as innocent as I was when I married , the first time . StillWell , if it happens , let 's see if we can change to me in the middle . That 'll sober him . Niobe thought of that , and of the likely reaction of the man . She started to laugh , though she did n't want to ; it really was n't at all funny . Clotho , meanwhile , was running down another passage . She plunged through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ main work chamber . About twenty students in white gi 's and white belts and yellow belts were practicing throws , supervised by a man in a brown belt . They paused at the sight of her , for Clotho 's summerp178dress was a complete contrast to their uniforms . She was in somewhat frilly blue , with a pink sash and a pink rose on the front , and her hair was bound in a western ponytail by a pink ribbon . She was the very picture of lovely young innocence . Then Samurai burst out after her , the very picture of masculine outrage . Earth stained his pretty robe and smudged his face , and blood dripped from his nose . The students gave way as he strode forward and caught Clotho by the arm . " Woman , you have no  --  " Clotho froze for an instant , then tried to tear herself away , but his grip was like iron . She spewed more Japanese at him . Hoo ! Atropos thought , mentally pursing her lips . No girl that age should know concepts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evidently learned things younger than did the conventional woman of prior generations , whatever the language . Samurai 's rage turned to something like awe , then to disgust . He snapped something back in Japanese . It seemed to translate to something like Atropos ' concept of the geisha girl . Clotho swung her hand at his head . He caught it and drew her in to him . He kissed her . She struggled , but could not escape . Slowly she relaxed . That man sure can kiss ! Atropos thought . The taming of the shrew , Niobe agreed . Then Clotho remembered herself . She bit Samurai on the lip . Then , at last , she remembered her powers . She flung out a thread and slid along it . The man 's arms were abruptly empty , for Fate was insubstantial when sliding . Astonished , he looked about . There was Clotho , ten feet away . Samurai started toward her  --  and she slid through him to the other side . The watching students gaped . When he turned and started for her again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ materialized at his legs , causing him to stumble over her . Then she slid another foot , passed through him , materializedagain , and kicked him in the rear . Samurai took a forward rolling breakfall and came smoothly back to his feet . " Magic ! " he cried . " My sword ! " The brown-belt hurried out , to return in a moment with a sheathed katana . Samurai took it and drew the gleaming blade . " I know how to deal with a witch ! " Get out of here , girl ! Atropos thought at Clotho . This time the girl heard . She sailed up a thread , out of the building . Then , in air , she paused . " But this is n't accomplishing my mission ! " she exclaimed  | " Welcome to reality , girl ! " Atropos muttered , using the mouth now that they were alone . " If that man was n't set to do Satan 's business before , he sure is now ! " " But what can I do ? I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Face . I 've embarrassed him in public , caused him to lose status . " " You mean he wo n't be reasonable now ? " Atropos inquired dryly . " He 's not a bad man , just arrogant ! I should n't have humiliatedhim ! " " Did n't he call you a whore ? " Atropos asked , and Niobe realized that the wise old woman was leading the foolish young one to a reconsideration . " He thought I was a geisha . That 's  --  I 'm sure he did n't intend it as an insult . It is an honored profession . " " Entertainer , " Niobe put in . " Companion . " " Well , then , girl , go back and apologize ! " Atropos snapped , sounding much the way she had when addressing the black teenager . " It 's not that simple , " Clotho said , torn . " I 'm a liberated woman . I do n't hold with  --  with  --  " " You 'd rather tell him to go to Hell ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter of face  --  I did n't mean to do that ! " " Did n't mean to jump to a conclusion and bawl him out in gutterJapanese ? " Atropos asked . " I  --  the old ways  --  all my life I 've opposed  --  " " Girl , you think your new ways look any better ? " " No , " Clotho whispered . " I  --  overreacted . " " Well , we 'd better go back and try to explain , " Niobe said , " or we 'll have to cut his thread . " " No ! " Clotho cried in anguish . " She 's not that liberated , " Atropos said . " Well , he is quite a man , " Niobe said . " Quite a man , " Clotho echoed ruefully . " Look , girl , you go on back there , " Atropos directed Clotho . " But this time listen to us . We 'll help you , same 's you helped me with that homework . Ai n't none of us knows it all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll get that man re-faced , somehow . " Clotho laughed , somewhat hysterically . " It wo n't work ! It does n't work that way ! " " Let 's try it anyway , " Atropos said . " He 's a man , and you 're onegood-looking young woman . He 'll listen . What 've we got to lose ? " Clotho shrugged fatalistically , then slid back down the thread . The class was already back in session , but the brown-belt criedout the moment Clotho materialized . She walked by him and into thehall to the office.
