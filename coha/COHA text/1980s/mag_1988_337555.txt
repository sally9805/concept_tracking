When the shuttle Discovery roars off the pad at the Kennedy Space Center next August to begin NASA 's climb back into manned space flight , one thought will be going through everyone 's mind : How safe is the crew ? Despite the best efforts of engineers and investigators , there is no way to know for sure , so NASA is building in a special safety factor . This week Navy parachutists at Edwards Air Force Base in California will begin testing the second of two newly designed shuttle escape systems . The first has already been put through its paces , and the one that works best will be installed in time to give Discovery 's crew a fighting chance to bail out of the ship in case of emergency . That should make the crew breathe easier . <P> Or maybe not . The bailout devices consist of rockets that whip the astronauts clear of the shuttle one by one , and a pole that allows them to slide out until they are clear of the craft 's wing . But both are designed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or less level , at altitudes of up to 20,000 ft.  --  well inside the earth 's atmosphere . That might do some good in a mission aborted before going into orbit , or in the case of an anticipated crash landing . However , says ex-Shuttle Astronaut Donald Peterson , " it 's like putting an emergency escape system in a car  --  but you have to be driving between 29 and 33 m.p.h. , at night , on an empty road . " Needless to say , neither system would have helped the Challenger crew . <P> Then why not do more ? Explains NASA 's William Chandler , who heads the crew escape project at Houston 's Johnson Space Center : " The bottom line is , there 's not a heck of a lot of protection we can provide without paying a significant penalty in time and weight . " Retooling the orbiter to include a &lt; more versatile system , such as ejection seats , could shut down the shuttle fleet for four more years . " We 'd run the risk of never flying again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ designs will have an escape system designed into it , " declares Discovery Crew Member Pinky Nelson . " But for now , if we want to fly , we 've got to live with what we 've got . " <P> As far as they go , both new systems look adequate . Each is designed to get astronauts safely clear of the shuttle 's fuselage and wings so they can parachute to earth . In a disaster  --  say , the loss of an engine  --  the crew will trigger explosives to jettison the escape-hatch cover , then exit one by one . If the rocket system is in place , each astronaut will be yanked from the ship with 2,000 lbs . of thrust . Otherwise , they will hook onto the telescoping pole , which will extend through the door , and let gravity and airflow pull them down and out of harm 's way . Both the astronauts and NASA favor the pole : it avoids the danger of rocket fuel in the cabin and takes up less space . Of course , entering a high-speed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perils . But , says Astronaut Nelson , something is better than nothing . " It enhances our chances of survival if we have to ditch , " he says . " It makes me feel a lot better . "
