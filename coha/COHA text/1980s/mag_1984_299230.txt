The Venice Biennale : two good shows , but much tired mannerism <P> The Venice Biennale is the longest-running festival-cum-survey in modern art . The first one was held in 1895 , and the 41st opened this month in its three dozen national pavilions , set in the public gardens a few minutes by vaporetto from Piazza San Marco . It is , as always , a hotchpotch with some loose thematic strands . The ostensible subject for 1984 is " Art and the Arts " - painting , sculpture and their connections to other media , to their own history , to architecture , and so on . Almost anything can be gathered under such an umbrella , and nearly everything has been , from plaster Apollos to graffiti , from marble to flickering television sets . The prevailing tone is of fatigue and mannerism . Everyone complains that the Biennale , like art itself , is in decline ; such complaints are a necessary part of the ritual of visiting it . But this year in particular the visitor feels like a tourist in a glass-bottomed boat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ polyp , there a parrot fish or sea fan , but acres of dead whitishgray coral to tell the real story . <P> There are two outstanding exhibitions this year . One is historical : " The Arts in Vienna from the Founding of the Secession to the Fall of the Hapsburg Empire , " a stupendous collocation of more than a thousand objects that fills the Palazzo Grassi : paintings by Klimt and Schiele , furniture by Hoffman and Moser , posters , stage designs , textiles , jewelry , ceramics by dozens of artists both famous and obscure . Apart from Venice itself , this is the main reason for going to Venice . The other is a one-man show by Howard Hodgkin at the English pavilion . Not since Robert Rauschenberg 's appearance at the Biennale 20 years ago has a show by a single painter so hogged the attention of visitors or looked so effortlessly superior to everything else on view by living artists . One enters it with a sense of relief : here the wearisome traits of much contemporary art , its honking rhetoric , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motifs , are left at the door , and the slow-surfacing complexities of mature , articulate painting greet the eye . <P> Hodgkin paints small , and his work combines the intimate with the declamatory . Every image seems to be based either on a room with figures or a peep into a garden from a window , and is regulated by layered memories of conversation , sexual tension and private jokes . But this is conveyed by an extraordinary blooming , spotting , bumbling and streaking of color , an irradiation of the mildly anecdotal by the aggressively visual . The small size of Hodgkin 's canvases puts a high premium on their quality of touch ( which rarely falters ) , but the color counts most . <P> When Rauschenberg won the painting grand prize ( long since abolished ) at the 1964 Biennale , European critics bitterly complained about American influence in the art world . Today , of course , such transatlantic rivalries are ancient history . They have been canceled by a market system based on multinational trading , where conglomerates of dealers sell their menus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Italian , American clients . There is not one American artist under 50 whose work creates the anxiety among discriminating Europeans that Rauschenberg and Jasper Johns , or their pop successors , did in the ' 60s.
