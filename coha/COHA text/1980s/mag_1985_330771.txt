Already one of the most intimidating players in basketball , former Georgetown Center Patrick Ewing last week took a giant step toward becoming one of the richest . The Jamaican-born 7-footer ended months of negotiations with the New York Knicks , signing a contract with the National Basketball Association club that calls for a $1.7 million paycheck in 1985 and up to $30 million over the next ten years . The deal makes him the highest-paid rookie in nba history . Ewing , 23 , who averaged 14.6 points and 9.6 rebounds for the Hoyas last season , appeared to remain above the media furor surrounding his professional future . " I feel great that it 's over , " he said after the final twelve-hour contract session at Madison Square Garden . " Now I can get down to doing what I do best , and that 's playing ball . " Basketball fans seem to agree . Since Ewing was acquired by the Knicks last May , the team has sold 9,500 season tickets , nearly twice the number bought by fans last year .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
