Three weeks after terrorists attacked the Greek excursion vessel City of Poros , killing nine people and wounding 98 , the identity and motivation of the attackers remain unknown . But last week a clue emerged when Greek police disclosed that some of the weapons used in the Poros shootings were originally sold to the Libyan army in 1976 . <P> The disclosure gave some credence to speculation that the City of Poros attack was carried out by members of Abu Nidal 's terrorist organization . Police suspect that the leader of the raid was Hejab Jaballah , an Abu Nidal confederate whose last known residence was Tripoli . Jaballah entered Greece on a Libyan passport almost six weeks before the assault , and was thought to be one of two men killed when a car loaded with explosives blew up at dockside only hours before the Poros bloodbath.
