Say what you will , complain as you wish  --  and it usually gives rise to plenty of speech and complaint  --  the Venice Biennale is always fun to visit . It also has an edge on all other festivals of contemporary art , like the more didactic Documenta at Kassel , West Germany . For when you have done the central show in the Italian pavilion in the public gardens , and sampled all the national pavilions from the U.S. 's to Yugoslavia 's , and sated whatever appetite you may have for the installation pieces of Aperto 88 , the section for artists under 40 that stretches like a deconstructionist via crucis through the long Piranesian gloom of the rope walk at the Arsenal , you can go back to the museums and immerse yourself in the Venetian past , an experience that tends to put some of the achievements of late or postmodernism in perspective . Moreover , it takes you away from the throng of dealers and neocollectors who descend on the Biennale like salesmen at a security-devices convention in Akron and would not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a Veronese or a Tintoretto ceiling . <P> The Biennale , which began in 1895 , is the oldest living , official new-art event . Through the ' 50s , it acquired an inimitable prestige , and its prizes were held to be enormously important in the marketing of an artist : nothing could have given Robert Rauschenberg 's career a faster boost than winning the Gran Premio in 1964 . This changed in the wake of ' 68 , when art-student radicals occupied the Accademia di Belli Arti , in protest against the commodification of culture ( how many of them , one wonders , are art dealers today ? ) . In panic , the Biennale decided in 1972 to jettison the prize system and turn itself into a noncompetitive symposium built around a historical or theme show in the Italian pavilion . Racked by ideological discord and enfeebled by the organizational skills of Italian intellectuals , the Biennale went into a tailspin for a number of years . <P> Now there is every sign that the Biennale is recovering its equilibrium . The prizes were put back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , amid general acclamation and to no one 's surprise , by Jasper Johns for his show in the U.S. pavilion . One long-overdue new pavilion has been added : Australia 's , showing a group of enormous paintings by the veteran expressionist Arthur Boyd , an artist of exceptional if uneven power whose work is hardly known in the U.S. <P> The artists most heavily featured in the Italian pavilion are Enzo Cucchi , Francesco Clemente and Sandro Chia  --  together with Mimmo Paladino , 40 , who has turned the main gallery into a continuous " environment " of stone figures , bronze emblems and copper sheet . Paladino 's masks , wheels , cauldrons , skulls and traceries of rose stems , cast in bronze , have a wild unsettled air , a mix of couture sophistication and peasant witchcraft , that is quite striking ; one only wishes that when he carves a figure in stone , it came out looking more like sculpture and less like a shop-window dummy . Also not to be missed is a hypnotic and mysterious installation by the Roman artist Maurizio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light contracts and expands in the darkness on a bed of red oxide .
