Presiding over the Communist Party congress last week , Mikhail Gorbachev reassured his comrades that he could improve the performance of the Soviet system without altering its basic tenets . Same ends , more efficient means . That seems to be the guiding principle of what will become known as the Gorbachev era . In Kremlin foreign policy , there has already been a noticeable change , not so much in goals and substance as in method and style . Deft and often deceptive flexibility rather than rigid continuity is now the order of the day . <P> No longer is the Soviet approach to the outside world epitomized by Andrei Gromyko , the man who made iron pants , stone walls and , of course , nyet so much a part of the vocabulary of diplomacy . Under Gromyko , Soviet foreign policy was much like WrestleMania 's archvillain Nikolai Volkoff , whose technique consists of grappling his opponent to the mat and sitting on him . With Gromyko kicked upstairs to the largely ceremonial post of President and Gorbachev 's protege Eduard Shevardnadze in charge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the sleek and powerful Soviet boxer portrayed in the movie Rocky IV . <P> After decades of taking the initiative and then dickering patiently over meager and grudging Soviet concessions , the U.S. suddenly finds itself on the receiving end of a flurry of grand gestures and sly teasers . Last month Gorbachev released one of the Soviet Union 's best-known prisoners of conscience , Anatoli Shcharansky , and promised Senator Edward Kennedy that 19 more refuseniks would be allowed to emigrate to the West . The Soviet leader thus multiplied the goodwill he had reaped for himself and also made sure that President Reagan would have to share credit with a leading liberal Democrat for this latest exodus of Soviet Jews . <P> On other diplomatic fronts , the Soviets are just as active . They are cultivating better relations with the conservative Arab states of the gulf , even as they whisper about the possibility of re-establishing full diplomatic relations with Israel . Turning eastward , the U.S.S.R. is looking for ways to build bridges to China and hinting that there might be a way to resolve Moscow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Army occupied late in World War II . The Soviets even made a bizarre eleventh-hour overture to Ferdinand Marcos , congratulating him on his " re-election " and seeking to capitalize on his estrangement from Uncle Sam .
