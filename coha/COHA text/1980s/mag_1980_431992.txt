 | At the headquarters of the Love Canal Homeowners Association in Niagara Falls , N.Y. , they poured champagne . " You can go with your families tonight and get a good night 's sleep in a nice clean environment , " said association president Lois Gibbs . But for many residents of the chemically contaminated Love Canal area , word that the government had finally agreed to move them temporarily seemed more of an occasion for small beer than bubbly . They wanted to leave and never come back . " If the United States has enough money to get the Cubans out of Cuba , they should have enough money to get us out of the Love Canal , " one resident screamed to a tumultuous meeting at a neighborhood church . The odd mixture of jubilation and anger was understandable . For years , the Love Canal families lived next to a toxic time bomb where the Hooker Chemicals &; Plastics Corp . had dumped 21,000 tons of noxious wastes . The residents became convinced that they were subject to an increased risk of cancer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Two years ago , government officials had declared a " health emergency " and relocated the 237 families living closest to the contamination site . Among the remaining 710 families , anxiety mounted steadily . And last week , fear turned into near panic when the Environmental Protection Agency revealed a report indicating that some residents had damaged chromosomes , further raising the specter of cancer among the living and unpredictable damage to future generations . Government officials seemed oddly unprepared for the furor caused by the report . Since 1978 , authorities had been trying to decide whether the danger at Love Canal warranted total evacuation of the area . The chromosome study , admittedly a " fishing expedition " according to one official , was commissioned to gather evidence in a $124 million Federal suit against Hooker Chemical . The EPA intended to decide whether to relocate the remaining families only after the study had been reviewed by geneticists . But when word about the broken chromosomes leaked , the agency hastily made the results public . Biogenics officials caused further outrage when they informed residents who took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offhand manner . " They just said my chromosomes were abnormal and handed me a letter , " said Patricia Sandonato . If EPA still had n't decided about relocation , the distraught Love Canalers had no trouble making up their minds . Association president Gibbs fired off a telegram to President Carter : " Do n't let our people get lost in a sea of red tape as we watch our babies fighting sickness and growing up into an uncertain future . " To force the government 's hand , two EPA officials were held " hostage " for six hours in the association 's headquarters while 250 outraged residents marched outside . Finally , President Carter signed an emergency order permitting temporary relocation . The Federal Emergency Management Agency agreed to release $3 million to $5 million to put the Love Canalers up in motels , hotels and other quarters . Until the FEMA worked out a voucher system to reimburse local motels , some residents could n't move . " We 're all poor , that 's why we live here , " said one occupant of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bill were turned away when motel managers learned that they lived near the Love Canal . One man got a room by feigning a Southern accent . No one wasted any time moving . " I 'm not going to stay here a day longer , " said Edmund Pozniak as he checked into Castle Motor Inn , " and I 'm never going back again . " Many residents protested the temporary relocation and insisted that the government buy out their homes so that they could move for good . " I want a fair market value for my house and to get this nightmare over with , " said Jo Ann Kott , who had suffered a miscarriage and a stillbirth . Risk : Other Love Canal women have shared Mrs. Kott 's nightmare . Two years ago , state health officials reported a 50 per cent higher risk of miscarriage among women there . Biochemist Beverly Paigen of Roswell Park Memorial Institute in Buffalo conducted a survey that showed a rise in birth defects . Of seventeen pregnancies in polluted areas last year , only two babies were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and nine babies with defects . Paigen has also recorded problems among adults , including seizures and depression . Evidence of neurological damage among Love Canal @#  | residents turned up by Paigen helped force the relocation decision . Paigen and Dr. Stephen Barron of the State University of New York , Buffalo , found that the speed with which electrical impulses traveled along peripheral nerves among 35 Love Canalers was slower than it was among volunteers living outside the region . Paigen concluded that the residents had undergone nerve damage , possibly caused by chemical exposure . Gap : The chromosome study that touched off the Love Canal rebellion is medically controversial . Carried out by the Biogenics Corp. , a private lab in Houston , on samples of white blood cells from 36 residents , it reported significant chromosome abnormalities in eleven subjects , a far higher proportion than would be expected . The aberrations included " ring chromosomes , " which occur when the ends of a chromosome break off and the remaining portion closes to fill the gap , and " supernumerary acentric chromosomes , " an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said that " chemical exposures at Love Canal may be responsible for much of the apparent increase in the observed cytogenic aberrations and that the residents are at an increased risk . " When experts sought to review the study , a series of puzzling events occurred . A party of geneticists dispatched to Houston by EPA to look over the testing procedures at Biogenics was turned away . The firm 's scientific director , Dr. Dante Picciano , protested that the group included a New York State researcher , which to him " smelled like a cover-up . " Subsequently , specialists did see the report and found serious flaws . The scientists criticized the study because it did n't include bloodsamples from people living outside the Love Canal area for comparison . They noted also that those chosen for the study already suffered from identifiable health problems , such as a history of miscarriages , that might not be related to chemical exposure . ' The Biogenics researchers ( did not report whether the participants had been exposed to X-rays , drugs , viral infections or other sources of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abnormalities listed in the report . Chromosome fragments such as those described may result from exposure to noxious agents , but do n't by themselves indicate a health threat . " They are not per se harbingers of cancer , birth defects or miscarriages , " says Dr. Arthur Bloom of Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center in New York . Despite the panel 's skepticism , government health officials decided to move out the Love Canalers . They cited particularly the evidence of increased miscarriages and the birth of low-weight infants reported in other surveys . " While it is hard to get a cause-and-effect relationship for any specific disease , there is an apparent increase in the number of disease states , " said EPA assistant administrator Stephen Gage . Before deciding whether to recommend permanent relocation , EPA plans more extensive studies , including sperm analysis , and a more detailed determination of the incidence of cancer and other diseases among residents . But for many Love Canalers , the future projects seen academic . The congressman from the Love Canal area , John LaFalce , said : " There 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to move back .
