On this particular day , the trouble is shoplifting . Deputy Halverson knows the problem well . He ' s seen the terror in the eyes of boys and girls caught stealing from neighborhood stores . He ' s seen their tragedies compounded when families , frightened and disillusioned , couldn ' t cope . He ' s seen adults in prison who began the same way - by lifting a candy bar , then a toy , then a watch , then more. // Shoplifting saddens Deputy Halverson , but on this day he is happy because he isn ' t at a school to find a culprit or make an arrest . Quite the opposite . He ' s there on an educational mission to head off shoplifting before it happens. // It ' s part of his newly created job as school liaison officer with the sheriff ' s department . His goal : to establish a new relationship with young people so they know police officers as friends and guardians who teach them the law and how to stay on the right side of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a friendly ' ' Hi , ' ' to the students , he establishes his authority by wearing his brown and tan officer ' s uniform and addressing them in a firm , matter-of-fact voice . He is careful not to scold , exaggerate , or intimidate his audience . ' ' I want them to share with me , ' ' he says . ' ' I want to develop their trust. ' ' // On the advice of older students , whom he consulted in advance , Deputy Halverson aims his shoplifting prevention message at fourth , fifth , and sixth-graders . ' ' The older kids told me to start young , ' ' he says , ' ' while children ' s minds are still open and their ideas are still being formed. ' ' // He begins his 45-minute presentation with a short film , ' ' Only Losers Play , ' ' produced for the National Coalition to Prevent Shoplifting ( NCPS ) and directed specifically at youngsters. // The film dramatizes typical situations involving the chief causes of youthful shoplifting : // * Peer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taunts of ' ' you ' re chicken . ' ' Saying , ' ' My friend made me do it ' ' is no help to the frightened boy who is nabbed by a security guard. // * The idea that stores are impersonal and nobody really owns the merchandise : A girl steals a necklace . Discovered by her mother and forced to return it to the store , the girl faces the owner and sees his anguish over the loss of merchandise he has purchased. // * Inability to handle money : A boy steals a game he could easily have bought had he saved his allowance . He realizes the pain he has caused his father , who thought he was teaching him how to budget his spending money. // ' ' Most young people who have gotten into trouble with the law weren ' t aware of the consequences or they wouldn ' t have done it , ' ' Deputy Halverson explains to his audience at the conclusion of the film. // Then he presses home the fact that ' ' shoplifting is a crime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They are not alone . A recent NCPS survey of youngsters showed 86 percent thought shoplifting was not a crime. // Next , he spells out the penalties . Most kids are picked up when their parents are not in the store , and in many communities they are taken to the store office and security guards call their parents . In Grand Traverse County , the system is purposely tougher . Deputy Halverson explains : // ' ' The store calls the police and they take you in a patrol car to the sheriff ' s department . There , I dial your home telephone number and I hand the phone to you . Then YOU must tell your mother or father that you are at the police station and what you did to get picked up by the police . You have to tell them you won ' t be released until they come to get you. ' ' // When this information sinks in , he says , ' ' You can hear a pin drop . Mom and Dad are not vague , they are very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience this would be . It ' s an awesome moment . It ' s the most powerful deterrent in the world. ' ' // He drives th point home , explaining that the child is still in police custody until he or she appears before a judge with the parents and the child tells again what crime has been committed. // ' ' If it ' s the first time , you are put on probation , ' ' he tells them . ' ' That means you are assigned a baby sitter , an adult probation officer who watches your every move for an average of six months . Your grades , school attendance , everything you do is reviewed before you can be taken off probation. ' ' // Then , another shocker : // ' ' If you become a habitual offender and go before the judge four or five times , you can be removed from your home and sent to a youth home. ' ' // And still another : // ' ' Once you hit 17 , if you still haven ' t learned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are an adult . Instead of being brought to the sheriff ' s office , you go right to jail . You are arrested . That arrest means you now have an adult criminal record . Think how many career doors are suddenly closed to you because you have to say ' yes ' on the application form where it asks if you ' ve ever been arrested. ' ' // Then Deputy Halverson introduces a representative of the county prosecutor ' s office who explains how the prosecutor represents the people in the courtroom and tries to prove in front of the judge the deed that led to the arrest. // Then an older student wearing a dog costume and a trench coat is introduced as McGruff , the Crime Dog , a national cartoon emblem used to ' ' take a bite out of crime . ' ' This gives the proceedings a light touch while still driving home the lesson that shoplifting is costly to children and to the nation. // It is the largest monetary crime in the country , costing merchants $16 billion annually and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 7 cents of every dollar spent on consumer goods goes to replace shoplifting losses or pay for preventive measures merchants must take. // In Grand Traverse County , merchants have rallied to support the shoplifting prevention program sponsored jointly by the Traverse City Women ' s Club , Cherryland Mall Merchants , and the sheriff ' s department. // The Women ' s Club and the Cherryland Mall merchants set up the school and club appearances for Deputy Halverson . To date , he has addressed 1 , 700 students in 12 elementary schools and hundreds of others at youth groups and Scout meetings. // The merchants in the mall also sponsored a poster contest in the schools with cash prizes and displayed the winning posters where shoppers could see them : ' ' Shoplifting is not uplifting , ' ' says one . ' ' Don ' t shoplift or this will happen to you , ' ' says another , with police and jail cells much in evidence. // In the future , Deputy Halverson hopes to take his message to high school students and adults with the film @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is a sequel to ' ' Only Losers Play . ' ' He is also developing an antidrug educational program for junior high students. // ' ' This program is evidence that the community cares about its children , ' ' Deputy Halverson says . ' ' The cooperation we ' re getting is outstanding . It ' s exciting . There ' s a lot of hope in it. ' ' // Dennis Halverson , who has a degree in criminal justice from Michigan State University , with emphasis on the juvenile offender , was hired by newly elected Sheriff Jack Canfield last April as the county ' s first school liaison officer. // ' ' Sheriff Canfield felt we were ignoring a large part of the population , our youth , who never had anybody to work with them and educate them regarding the law and police officers , ' ' Deputy Halverson says . ' ' Generally , the only time we came into contact with them was when they were a victim or a suspect . He wants to change that and have youngsters see the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is to enforce the law. ' ' // Deputy Halverson describes his job as ' ' pro-active ' ' law enforcement , or prevention , as opposed to most police work , which is ' ' reactive ' ' - police reacting once a crime has been committed. // ' ' My pet peeve is that police are often made the ' heavy , ' ' ' he says . ' ' If I go into a restaurant in my uniform , I invariably hear someone whisper to a child , ' If you don ' t behave , I ' m going to tell that policeman . ' I want kids to know me as a friend they can call on. ' ' // He feels this change is coming. // ' ' The best part for me is knowing that if I can keep one youngster from starting out on the road of crime , from getting a record , I will have done what I want to do with my life.
