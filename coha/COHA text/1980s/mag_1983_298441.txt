<P> Africa 's onetime model state betrays its promise <P> <P> The refugees waved and cheered from overcrowded trucks ; thousands of them stampeded joyfully down the gangways of rusty ships docked at Ghana 's port of Tema . They were home after an often brutal fortnight spent in flight from Nigeria , more than 200 miles to the east . Along with workers from other nearby countries , the Ghanaians had been made scapegoats for Nigeria 's formidable economic problems , and last month the Nigerian authorities gave them just two weeks to leave the country . Terrorized by fear of reprisals if they stayed , more than 500,000 Ghanaians braved beatings , bureaucratic delays and dwindling food supplies to reach their homeland . At least 30 died en route . <P> Those who made it back quickly found an impoverished nation hopelessly in debt , staggering under an increasingly unpopular , largely ineffectual military regime . It was not always so . Back in the late ' 50s , Ghana ( pop . 11.5 million ) was something of a showcase for African nationalism . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it produced nearly 10% of the world 's gold . Its Western-style constitution promised civil liberties and political stability . Over the years , however , Ghana 's promise was betrayed by a succession of inept governments and ill-considered economic policies . The returnees last week were quickly hustled off to their native villages , where few of them will find work and many may go hungry . <P> What has become a blueprint for failure began as Africa 's first black nation to emerge from colonial rule . Under the charismatic leadership of its first President , Kwame Nkrumah , Ghana gained independence from Britain in 1957 . But poor planning and extravagant government spending soon undermined the economy , while incompetent officials and pervasive corruption eroded Nkrumah 's popular support . In 1966 he was overthrown in a widely popular military coup . That revolt set the pattern for the future ; in the succeeding 17 years Ghana has endured five such coups . <P> The current military ruler , Flight Lieut . Jerry Rawlings , 35 , first came to power in 1979 , when he overthrew a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ return to parliamentary government . He made good on his second promise , calling free elections three weeks after the coup , but after just two years of civilian rule Rawlngs again moved in with his army strongmen . A leftist revolutionary descended from a Scottish engineer father and a Ghanaian mother , Rawlings promised on regaining power that Cuba would be the model for Ghana 's development . <P> After just 13 months , however , Rawlings ' administration is in danger of collapse . He has alienated intellectuals by abolishing the constitution and outlawing all political parties . Of the seven original members of Rawlings ' governing Provisional National Defense Council , only two remain in office . The growing belief is that Ghana 's economic problems are beyond Rawlings ' limited talents to master . Says a onetime schoolmate : " Rawlings is strong on rhetoric but weak on reality .
