While her father sat in the sun and pulled the memories from his mind , her children chased seagulls along the spit of sand that ran down to the edge of the blue water . Out on the horizon , a couple of sailboats battled for a share of the day ' s small breeze while the woman listened to the old man ' s voice , a voice now in its 67th year , as it held her and walked her back through time . She thought of her brothers and wondered if they knew the father better than she did ; whether sons automatically know fathers better than daughters ; whether there is some forged alliance of blood between males that allows more feeling to be shared . She doubted it . He had taken the time in those summers past to teach her how to sail and how to whistle . He had taken her aside and , without telling anyone else , showed her how to throw a baseball and hold a tennis racket . He would usher her from the supper table and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sea wall just as the crimson dusk ran away with another day of their lives . Oh , there were moments when she was sure that her father was a bit mad , a bit odd , certainly different . He would be talking about the pull of the waves and about the universe and then , without the slightest shift of gears or change of tone , be into a discussion of the boys who crossed the grass in between the yards of the summer homes sitting at the edge of the sea . He entertained her with stories of his own childhood , about how he grew up . He took her once back to the home where he spent his youth and , she remembered , got out of the car and walked along the street ; all the time looking at bits and pieces of the old neighborhood as if they were bookmarks in a novel that the two of them were just then reading aloud . She regretted now ever having been embarrassed by him . She remembered with pain those feelings within her that bordered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the living room with one of her father ' s monologues . Not that the little talks were ever on morality or what time the boy would get her home . They weren ' t . Instead , they would be on anything that had captured the father ' s attention that particular day . A long line of teenagers had sat stuffed in one of the big , easy chairs with looks that approached fear and numbness creasing their young faces as her father conducted filibusters on the space program , the origins of war , baseball , why no one ever really made money in the stock market or why he did not like freckles ; all of it without interruption and certainly no understanding from the audience . It never failed . The first hour of any night out would be spent with her date trying to figure out what the father was all about .

On the day she got married , he gave her away . On the day her first child was born , he gave her flowers . On the day she got divorced , he gave her understanding . He was sitting there now , reminding her of the morning when he helped her make a kite and how the two of them had trotted along the dunes pulling their invention behind them . That was the summer of her ninth year . That was a time when she knew , she just knew , that her daddy was the smartest man on the face of the earth . He asked her if she remembered how the project had failed ; how their nylon flying machine had been bitten by the strong wind and sent to its death in the waves below ? How she had cried and he had risked pneumonia and maybe evenhimself by swimming into the angry surf after a collection of material that cost 89 cents but was thought to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ son came up onto the lawn from the beach and broke into the old man ' s trip through time . The boy ' s foot was bleeding from a scrape on the rocks that dotted the shallow ocean floor and tears formed a statement at the edge of the child ' s eyes . The boy looked at his mother as his grandfather held him gently and used a handkerchief to dab at the blood mixed with wet sand on the sole of the child ' s foot . When this operation had been completed , the old man brushed away the tears with the back of his hand before he held his grandson by the shoulders , pulling him forward and giving him a hug . Before he let go , he kissed the 7- year-old softly on the forehead and ran his fingers through the boy ' s straw-colored hair and told him that he cried just like his mother used to with exactly the same look .
