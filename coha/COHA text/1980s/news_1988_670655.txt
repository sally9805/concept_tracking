Urologists , gerontologists and other specialists said they fear that many older people have come to believe that urinary incontinence is inevitable and untreatable. // Particularly disturbing , some say , is the recent promotion of absorbent pads and adult diapers for people embarrassed by varying degrees of involuntary urination. // " These ads are discouraging because they are sending a message to people that there is nothing else to be done , " said Dr. Alan J. Wein , chairman of urology at the University of Pennsylvania Medical School in Philadelphia. // // A Diverse Range of Therapies // Dr. Wein and others who attended a National Kidney Foundation seminar here this week , and experts contacted elsewhere , said many forms of incontinence can be attacked with a diverse range of therapies , including drugs , selective catheterization , electrical stimulation and surgery . Doctors also help train patients to strengthen and control the muscles that regulate the flow of urine. // " I don ' t think that people have gotten the message at all that incontinence is not a normal function of aging and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of cases , " said Dr. David R. Staskin , a urologist at the Boston University School of Medicine who specializes in the condition . " Incontinence is not a disease ; it is just a sign of another problem. " // The condition is seldom discussed , but experts estimate that it afflicts , to some degree , 10 percent to 20 percent of people over 65 years old. // While the absorbent wear is helpful for some patients , Dr. Staskin said he objected to certain promotions because they are the only messages many people see about incontinence . He noted that there are no public service advertisements to publicize incontinence , and there is little information to suggest that people seek help . <> <> Refusal by Manufacturers // The doctor said he has been unable to persuade the makers of absorbent products to put messages on their packaging suggesting that users see a specialist . Nor will they include information on patient groups that can provide information , such as the Simon Foundation of Wilmette , Ill. , which can be reached toll-free at 1-800-23SIMON. // Fewer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consult a doctor about them , experts estimate , and uninformed physicians sometimes tell those who do inquire that little can be done. // " Many people are embarrassed and think this is normal , and many physicians never ask about urinary or bowel control , " Dr. Staskin said. // Incontinence , the involuntary loss of control of the bladder or bowel , primarily affects the elderly . Of those over the age of 65 , two to three times as many women are affected as are men . But the condition , sometimes caused by disease or injury , can affect people regardless of age or sex . <> <> Forms of Incontinence // " Stress incontinence , " which causes people to lose urine from abdominal pressure on the bladder when laughing , coughing or standing up too quickly , is a common form of the condition , particularly among women. // Other manifestations of the problem include " urge incontinence , " characterized by an unexpected , uncontrollable urge to urinate , and " reflex incontinence , " in which a person is unaware of the need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the bladder is full. // In dread of the potential embarrassment of an accident in public or the smell of urine in social situations , many of the incontinent patients withdraw from work or socializing and become homebound. // The National Institute on Aging says incontinence is a major cause of admissions to nursing homes , along with physical disabilities and dementia. // About 55 percent of all nursing home residents have chronic urinary incontinence , while about 25 percent have bowel incontinence , the agency said . Almost one-third of the $24 billion spent annually on nursing home care goes to treat or care for incontinent patients , according to recent Federal estimates . <> <> Methods of Treatment // While certain physical changes associated with aging , such as shrinkage of the bladder and weakened muscles , can contribute to the condition , aggressive treatment can counteract the problem , experts say. // Surgery can improve or cure incontinence by repositioning a fallen bladder or removing an obstruction . In some cases , doctors can implant an artificial sphincter muscle to replace the tiny ring-like muscle that closes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Advanced techniques have also enabled surgeons to help most men with urinary problems because of an enlarged prostate. // Many patients can be helped by training in how to regain strength in the muscles that control urination , said Dr. Bernard T. Engel , who has pioneered biofeedback training at the institute ' s Gerontology Research Center in Baltimore. // Retraining includes scheduled urination and exercises to strengthen muscles that control the bladder and valves that shut off urination. // With the biofeedback methods , doctors put devices to measure pressure into the rectum or vagina to help patients train their muscles . <> <> Training the Proper Muscles // When patients first try to control the urinary sphincter directly , they frequently squeeze down on the abdominal muscles , which puts pressure on the bladder and makes leaking worse , Dr. Engel said . Patients learn that squeezing the rectal sphincter also contracts its urinary counterpart. // " With about three training sessions like these , which last about an hour each , patients learn how to strengthen their contractions and hold them , " Dr. Engel said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a laugh or a cough , they can contract the sphincter beforehand and avoid leaking. " // Dr. Wein said that in addition to surgery and biofeedback training , other treatments include electrical stimulation that exercises and strengthens both the bladder and sphincter , and drugs that increase sphincter resistance and decrease bladder contractibility. // " Virtually all forms of incontinence are treatable , but we have to educate people that help is available , " he said. //
