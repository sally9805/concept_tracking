Their work is unprecedented - an attempt to compile and publish a Bible in the language of Gullah , a lyrical medley of West African , Caribbean , and English elements still spoken by thousands in this region of salt marsh and oak groves. // But although the religious emphasis is primary , the Sea Island translation team , as its members are called , hopes its work will encompass still more. // The team ' s leader , the Rev. Ervin Greene , pastor to nearby Daufuskie Island , says that by formalizing the unwritten language , the work should eventually help natives assimilate into a tourism-based economy without losing touch with a rich past . ' ' When a person loses his language , he loses his entire culture , ' ' Mr. Greene says. // // Once described as ' ' flutelike , ' ' Gullah is the American variety of a West African trade language that spread with slavery to the Caribbean and South America , according to William A. Stewart , a linguist at the City University of New York. // Combining elements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a Caribbean cadence , it became the common language of overseers , plantation owners , and slaves . Today Professor Stewart estimates almost 250 , 000 people , including about 10 , 000 in New York City , continue to speak Gullah , primarily on the thousands of small sea islands stretching from North Carolina to northern Florida. // Considered a creole language by linguists , Stewart says Gullah has its own grammar , sentence structure , and phonetics , and is frequently characterized by its use of colorful phrases. // For instance , ' ' dayclean ' ' is used for morning and ' ' dry long so , ' ' means simple and direct , he explains. // ' ' It ' s one of the many languages which just haven ' t happened to be written down , ' ' says Pat Sharpe , a trained linguist working with the team. // Sponsored by the nondenominational Wycliffe Bible Translators and the related Summer Institute of Linguistics , Pat and Claude Sharpe came to the area in 1979 and have provided technical assistance to the team of eight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with about 35 reviewers across the sea islands from North Carolina to Georgia. // The team has set three goals : the Bible ' s translation , the charting of Gullah ' s formal linguistics , and the development of teaching aids for eventual use in schools. // So far about 30 percent of the New Testament has been translated , and completion is expected in 1992. // With the linguistic groundwork then established , the Old Testament could be finished within five years , Mr. Greene estimates . As sections are completed , Mrs. Sharpe says , they are taken to the most effective testing laboratory available , nearby Daufuskie Island. // Though bulldozers and builders are beginning to mirror development on neighboring Hilton Head Island , Daufuskie for years has been the isolated home to a largely poor , black , and illiterate population speaking in Gullah. // Similar changes have already begun on St. Helena Island , the largest of some 15 sea islands off Beaufort , S.C. A 45-square-mile area of vast fields and flat-brown marshes , St. Helena was freed by Union troops shortly after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natives as a ' ' cradle of liberty ' ' for black people. // Descendants of slaves today travel oak-shaded roads past former plantations to work at Marine Corps bases on Parris Island and outside Beaufort , or perhaps to resorts on nearby Fripp , Dataw , or Hilton Head Islands. // Though blacks account for 70 percent of the islands ' population , their number has remained steady , while the number of white residents grows an average of 8 to 11 percent every five years , according to the Beaufort Planning Commission. // Still , Mr. Greene is not particularly worried that Gullah will one day disappear . ' ' If it has withstood what has happened over the past 200 years , then , of course , development is not going to change it , ' ' he says . Instead , he pushes for ' ' a raising of the awareness ' ' of Gullah ' s distinction as a language , and its potential use for teaching standard English. // Many natives now ' ' can speak Gullah , and they can speak a fairly good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we call ' where the river meets the road ' - writing it down - they can ' t make the switch , ' ' Mr. Greene says. // Although the Sharpes avoid the issue , Mr. Greene says he hopes to approach legislators in the next few years with proposals for bilingual education in schools . Many parents correct children as they speak Gullah , he says , unknowingly contributing to the elimination of ' ' a beautiful part of the child ' s life. ' ' // Instead , he says he believes parents should help their children draw a sharp distinction between Gullah and standard English . ' ' Students need to get a firm grasp of Gullah , ' ' he says , not only so they can speak it properly , but also to cultivate the respect it deserves. // ' ' Without a respect and appreciation for one ' s language , one feels there is nothing there of real respect , ' ' Mr. Greene says. // And as he studies and promotes the study of Gullah , Mr. Greene continues to marvel at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a trip to Jamaica when a cabdriver offered him some advice. // ' ' I said , ' Sir , you sound just like someone from home , ' ' ' Mr. Greene recalls . ' ' He said , ' Oh yeah , mon , we came on de same boat , you gis got off at a different port .
