Robert Bork was ready to give up . After a punishing confirmation ordeal , his appointment to the U.S. Supreme Court faced near certain defeat as a majority of Senators joined the tide against him . After wearily advising Ronald Reagan and Attorney General Edwin Meese that he had little fight left in him , the judge retreated last Thursday afternoon to his judicial chambers , where he began writing an angry statement withdrawing his nomination for the job he had wanted most of his career . <P> Making the decision had been wrenching . Last Wednesday , the day after the Senate Judiciary Committee advised against his confirmation , Bork met with a group of die-hard Republican supporters on Capitol Hill . Of the 16 in attendance , all except Wyoming 's Alan Simpson , one of Bork 's most ardent backers , argued that the judge should let his nomination go to the floor . " There could be 60 votes against him , " Simpson hedged . " I do n't think a recorded vote like that would be good for Judge Bork . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Washington Lawyer Leonard Garment ( who irritated Bork by presuming to act as his public spokesman ) yelled at him , " If you pull out , you 're a quitter ! " But Irving Kristol , a conservative author , urged him to cut his losses and withdraw . Tired of the emotionally draining experience and bitter about his inevitable defeat , Bork slipped into the White House Wednesday afternoon and told the President he was inclined to bow out . <P> Bork was unswayed by the argument that by continuing the battle he would force a recorded vote on the issue , thus discomforting some of the Southern Democrats who had lined up against him . " I 'm not a politician , " he told the President . " I do n't really understand this business of making them pay a price . I 've got a life to lead . " Reagan assured his nominee he would understand if he decided to pull out . The following day , Bork 's wife and two sons accompanied him to a meeting with Meese . <P> But as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called . " I 've been thinking it over , " the Senator said . " You ought to stand up for the principle involved if you think you can do it . " Bork 's resolve began to weaken . Meanwhile , his family debated the decision in a law clerks ' lounge across the hall . Soon after he finished talking to Simpson , they entered his chambers . " Something 's bothering us , " Charles Bork told his father . " You ca n't quit . To quit now would be to a great degree to concede the validity of the attack against you . " <P> Bork decided they were right . He likened the situation to his role in the Saturday Night Massacre , when his first inclination was to resign after firing Special Prosecutor Archibald Cox at President Nixon 's request . Instead , he decided it would be best to stay and see the crisis through . Putting aside his withdrawal statement , Bork began , with the help of his sons , to draft an eloquent explanation of his decision to fight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
