txt The U.S. , France . West Germany and Britain agreed to boost to a common level the interest rate they charge on loans to encourage aircraft exports , helping to limit the transatlantic export-subsidy war . William Draper , president and chairman of the U.S. Export-Import Bank , said the four countries will set a minimum 12% interest rate on loans to help foreigners purchase their aircraft . That is an increase of more than three percentage points from the rates the three European countries previously charged and it is 2.75 percentage points higher than the previous U.S. rate . " We regard the successful conclusion of our informal discussions on aircraft to be a major breakthrough in our continuing effort to limit export subsidization . " Mr. Draper said . He added that the Reagan administration hopes the agreement will give new impetus to U.S. efforts at eliminating direct export subsidies entirely . Boon for U.S. Air Industry Mr. Draper predicted that the increased rates will be a " great help " to the U.S. aircraft industry . " Now we 'll be on an equal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standpoint , " he said . The new minimum rate will apply to loans made to support sales of Douglas Corp . ' s DC9-80 and DC10-10 , Lockheed Corp . ' s L1011-100 and L-1011-200 and Boeing Co. ' s 757 and 767 . The agreement comes less than three weeks after the Ex-Im Bank announced an Increase to 10.75% from 8.75% in its interest rates for loans supporting nonaircraft subsidies . That rate boost was designed to help narrow an expected $120 million budget gap the bank was projecting for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1 . As a result of that increase and other changes , Mr. Draper said , the bank is currently projecting a fiscal 1982 loss of about $40 million . The increase in the aircraft credit rate wo n't improve the Ex-Im Bank 's budget situation quickly , but it should help . Mr. Draper said . He noted that the 12% minimum rate is still below the bank 's current 13.6% cost of borrowing money from the Treasury . In recent years aircraft-related loans have represented as much as 40 ' - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The U.S. had been threatening for some time to lengthen the term of its direct export-credit loans if European governments would n't agree to reduce their own export subsidies , Mr. Draper said the Ex-Im Bank has agreed it wo n't exceed the current 10-year term on such loans as part of the agreement lifting export credit rates . The Ex-Im Bank president said the new agreement will run until Oct. 1 . 1982 . But by then , he said , the U.S. hopes a similar agreement will be reached that would include all governments and a wider range of exports . " We foresee a major impact on all export subsidies . " he said . " Our foreign competition is hopefully put on a better balance from this point forward . " Even with the agreement , the aircraft , export lending policies of the four countries wo n't be identical . For one thing , the Ex-Im Bank will still charge an extra one-time fee of 2% on aircraft-export credits . as it does on other types of export loans . Also , the agreement will allow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an airplane , while foreign export lending agencies may extend as much as 62.5% of an aircraft 's cost . Finally , France will be able to set an interest rate one-half percentage point below the 12% minimum for loans made in French francs .
