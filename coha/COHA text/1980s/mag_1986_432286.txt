 | It used to be a common sight ? beefy businessmen bursting their pinstripes as they drank martinis and gorged on rare red meat . They were the kind of type A guys who liked to negotiate million-dollar deals while bragging about their bypass operations . It was an elaborate display of macho , the type of behavior scientists observe in apes . Well , the drinks began to evaporate some time ago , then chicken and fish chased steak off the plate . Now the whole meal may be threatened with extinction . Goodbye power lunch , hello power tea . The menu of American business is changing ? call it the postinflation diet . During the fat years of the 1970s , managing became mainly a matter of raising prices . Corporations found it easy to make consumers pay the cost of increased expenses . But after the recession of the early 1980s and the invasion of the imports , management is now mostly a matter of cutting costs . " Lean and mean " is the catch phrase of the executive suite , and skipping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cities Communications chairman Tom Murphy , who instituted a stringent cost-reduction program when his company took over ABC , sets the tone by eating a sandwich at his desk most days . In this era , " more companies pride themselves on working harder , " says E. Webb Bassick IV , an executivecompensation specialist at Hewitt Associates of Lincolnshire , Ill . " It 's hypocritical to tell workers they should do more to hold down costs and then march off to an expensive business meal . " No time : Cost-consciousness is n't the only reason the power lunch is becoming passe . Other factors include the shift of offices to the suburbs , the increase in women executives and the demands of an ever-growing workload . For good measure , tax-reform legislation now in Congress would further inhibit overindulgence by limiting the deductibility of business meals . " There 's no question that in the business world , lunches are out , " says James R. Baehler , author of " The Book of Perks " ( 1983 ) . " Let 's do lunch ' has become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ companies that have moved to the suburbs are discovering that good restaurants are scarce in sylvan settings . At Baxter Travenol headquarters north of Chicago , for example , corporate officers sometimes entertain guests over hamburgers delivered from a nearby restaurant . For others , time is more valuable than nourishment . " For lunch I sign loan papers , " says Edward Podboy , a mortgage banker in Palatine , Ill. , who 's been working 72-hour weeks to meet the demand for mortgages . " It 's very low-cal . " And on Wall Street , a long lunch can cost millions . " The markets move too much now , " says Mary Davey , a bond saleswoman at Bank of America in New York . " You can end up losing a lot of money if you go out to lunch for two hours like you did 10 years ago . " Then there is the woman question , or rather , the lack of woman questions . When it comes to making civilized small talk , a lot of businessmen have a distinctly limited repertoire . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with another guy about the Cubs or the Bears , " says a Chicago advertising salesman . " But what the hell can I talk with a woman about except business ? " In fact , women are at the forefront of the less-lunch movement . Many women began working through lunch to prove themselves ? and have stuck to the habit as they 've risen . Some corporations actively discourage business at mealtime . Minneapolis-based Control Data Corp . has a one-hour-lunch 44 NEWSWEEK : JUNE 30 , 1986  | rule , and company policy dictates that no deals be concluded in a session where alcohol is served . " A lot of purchasing agents have had to change their ways of doing business , " says spokeswoman Maureen Rangen . Some executives need no encouragement to skip lunch : they find a table cluttered with plates , glasses and silverware as much a hindrance to doing serious business as a mind clouded with drink . " I hate restaurants , " says John Toppel , a sales manager at Hewlett-Packard . " I 'm not in control . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ becomes the big deal . " Stamina counts : Nature abhors a power vacuum , of course , so a number of lunch substitutes have sprung up . In Chicago it 's " power tea . " Starting at 3 p.m. at the 65-year-old Drake hotel , business people stride purposefully into the high-ceilinged Palm Court . The delicate tea service leaves plenty of room for executives to spread out their papers on the table , and they need n't worry about making an expensive decision while under the influence of alcohol . For the more active , there is always the power run . Ed Moose , coowner of San Francisco 's Washington Square Bar and Grill , often sees old customers jogging past his window in athletic gear . Rubin Glickman , a 52-year-old real-estate developer and lawyer , waves as he goes by . " I still deal with power people all the time , " says Glickman . " But we might swim or run for lunch . " According to Glickman , physical stamina is his most potent negotiating tool . " When you run , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best deals , " he says . Though not yet dead , the power lunch has , already been reincarnated ? as the power breakfast . " A breakfast meeting tells the client , I 'm lean , mean , healthy and you have to catch up with me , ' " says Jerry McGee , managing director at Ogilvy &; Mather in Los Angeles . In New York , the 21 Club is spending $4 million on a " breakfast club " where corporate members can hold early-morning sessions . And the power play at breakfast is not how many martinis you hoist but how many breakfasts you host . Marty Turchin , of the real-estate brokerage Edward S. Gordon Co. , holds three or four breakfast meetings a day at the Brasserie in Manhattan . " Things are so desperate , people ca n't wait until lunch to resolve them , " says advertising eminence Jerry Della Femina . " They save lunches for people who are n't mad at them . " Bands of hardy traditionalists can be found in every city , jamming the tables at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Even many of these restaurants , however , have at least lightened their menus , dropping cream sauces in favor of simpler , grilled fare . Lunch is especially popular with people who work in what might be called the nonproductive industries . Roger Stone , for example , is a political consultant in Washington ; his reputation for being important is his most important asset . He lunches out often , primarily so that politicians and prominent journalists will see him dining with other politicians and prominent journalists . Some lunch advocates believe a marathon midday meal can be constructive . " It 's hard to do business when you only deal with one vision of the universe , " says Ted Thompson , who runs his own advertising firm in San Francisco . " If we sit around and have a few drinks , we will discover something we would n't otherwise . " Thompson 's idea of a good lunch begins with a half hour at the bar . Then " you should have a good bottle of wine with your meal and then some port , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a really good lunch when someone looks at his watch and says , My God , it 's 4 o'clock ' . " Sam Dietz , coowner of the Washington Square , where Thompson is a regular , defines the ultimate power luncher as the person who does n't even have to call his office to say he 'll be late . To accommodate those who wish to appear above calling in , Dietz installed a pay phone in the men 's room . Businessmen may discreetly excuse themselves , secretly call the office , then return and ostentatiously order another round . As for Thompson , " When I go to lunch , I 'm through for the day , " he says . Perhaps as the power lunch fades into business history Thompson and others like him can form little clubs to perpetuate the ancient rites . Meanwhile , a growing number of serious , productive business people can be found munching at their desks . In fact , I 'd better wrap this up ? the delivery guy is here .
