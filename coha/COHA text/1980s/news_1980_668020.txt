The future direction of the hockey program at St. Lawrence University may be determined at the school board of trustees ' annual meeting next Friday in New York . And in the opinion of most observers , the outcome should tip the scales in favor of a return to prominence . The trustees will act on a proposal that already has the backing of student , faculty , alumni and community leaders in Canton , N.Y . Under that plan , full grant-in-aid scholarships would be available to hockey players , meaning St. Lawrence would become competitive once again in terms of recruitment of top Division 1 talent . Once the trustees decide the grant-in-aid issue , the next move will be to name a hockey coach to replace Leon Abbott , who resigned recently . Among the names prominently mentioned are Colgate coach Terry Slater , a St. Lawrence graduate ; Ned Harkness , presently general manager of the Adirondack Red Wings in Glens Falls , N.Y. ; and interim head coach Dale Henwood , who was an assistant to Abbott . St. Lawrence has a proud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between 1952 and 1962 and won the inaugural ECAC championship at the Boston Arena in 1962 . But recently , hard times have set in . St. Lawrence finished 16th out of 17 teams in Division 1 last year and is 4-11 this season . The ECAC will poll a panel of 20 observers throughout the ECAC Division 1 geographical area to determine a Team of the Decade ( 1969- 70 through 1978-79 ) , which will be announced the week of its playoff championship game at Boston Garden on March 15 . The panel will select a six-man first team and a six-man second team . . . Paul Castraberti , who led Yale in scoring the past two seasons but has been out since fracturing an ankle in a practice drill in late November , may return to the lineup for the game against Boston College on Jan. 22 . . . Colgate high scorer Bill McCreary ( 7 goals , 13 assists for 20 points ) has dropped out of school for academic reasons , a somber note two days after a big 6-4 win at Cornell . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ East , has struggled to a 2-3 Division 1 start and is 4-5 overall . " We haven ' t had five losses this early in any season since 1964 , " lamented coach Dick Bertrand . " It ' s frustrating . It ' s little things . We ' ve been blowing leads . Every time we made a mistake , Colgate scored . " Goaltender Brian Hayward missed part of the early season with mononucleosis . " He ' s just getting back to top form , " said Cornell assistant Lou Reycroft , a former Brown goaltender . " The only thing he needs to get him back completely is time . He ' s anxious . " Cornell entertains BostonCollege tomorrow at sold-out Lynah Rink . With a crowd of 5296 on hand for its debut on Monday in the Garden , the first Division 2 Teapot Tournament ( Lowell , Salem State , Merrimack , Bowdoin ) was one up on its Division 1 counterpart , the Beanpot ( Boston University , Boston College , Harvard , Northeastern ) , which drew 711 for its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first Beanpot doubleheader , on Dec. 26 , 1962 , lured 5105 to the Boston Arena . . . Salem State and Bowdoin face off in the Teapot final next Monday night , a preview of a regular-season date five days later at Salem . " If we can forecheck Bowdoin as well as we did Lowell ( in a 5-2 win ) , we ' ll be in busines , " offered Salem State coach Mike Gilligan . " We ' ll come right at them as hard as we can and hope we can slow them down . Bowdoin has a good passing team . " The third Maine Holiday Classic in Portland ' s Cumberland County Civic Center opens tonight , with Colby meeting Merrimack at 6:30 , followed by a game between Maine and Bowdoin . . . The so-called Beanpot of the North Country ( Maine , New Hampshire , Vermont , Dartmouth ) is set for Dec. 30-31 , 1981 in Hanover , N.H. , and organizers of a revived holiday event at the Syracuse War Memorial Auditorium are hoping it will evolve into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ participate in Syracuse next December . They ' ll be joined by Elmira and Princeton . St. Lawrence enters in 1981 and , if RPI joins in , the field of Colgate , Clarkson , St. Lawrence and RPI would be a geographical natural . . . The NCAA Division 2 championships at Elmira have been moved up a week from March 20-22 to March 13-15 . . . BU recently abandoned its Varsity B program , a sign of the times . After Craig Homola of Vermont received a call from US Olympic coach Herb Brooks inviting him to join the team , Vermont coach Jim Cross said , " Sleep on it , " when Homola reacted negatively . Fifteen minutes later , Homola called Cross and said he was passing it up . Brooks bypassed Homola after the US tryouts at the Olympic Sports Festival last summer in Colorado Springs , even though Homola was one of the top centers in the camp . He may be the East ' s most exciting player , a game-breaker who ' s fun to watch and is partly responsible for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ won 10 of its last 12 games and its last four in a row . Boston University will travel to Gutterson Field House as the Catamounts ' opposition tomorrow night .
