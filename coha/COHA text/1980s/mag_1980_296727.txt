Shushing the swish-swish <P> The world 's largest windmill began operating last year in Boone , N.C. With blades that stretch 60 meters ( 200 ft. ) from tip to tip and can generate 2,000 kw of electricity , it is also , it seems , the world 's noisiest . Besides dominating the scenic Blue Ridge Mountains landscape-or despoiling it , as some of those living near by complain-the monster rattles windows , bounces cups and saucers and creates an irritating swish-swish . <P> Surprised by this unexpected noise pollution from an experimental power plant that was supposed to be almost entirely free of environmental headaches , engineers from the U.S. Department of Energy and NASA flocked to Boone ( pop . 8,754 ) . Their findings : though the very low-frequency sound waves ( about 2 cycles per sec. ) from the windmill are below the usual range of human hearing , they can be amplified by wind and weather conditions and the terrain over which they are directed and thus become powerful enough to vibrate objects in the home . <P> Muffling the wind machine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , including a change of blades and electrical generators to allow for slower rotation . It may also require a reorientation of the basic design , so that future windmills face into the wind rather than away from it . Meanwhile , the Department of Energy has given Boone some temporary relief . Until some way can be found to hush the noisy blades , they will no longer be allowed to whirl at night , in the early morning or on weekends . ?
