Helene von Damm , for several weeks now , has been in search of the great exodus . It is proving elusive . Not a bird or a plane , the great exodus is a phenomenon whose advent is confidently predicted by journalists every two years : the mass departure of political appointees from the Federal Government . Once in a while the journalists are correct . Lack of money , 18-hour days , media prying and policy failures send droves of discouraged reformers back to the family business . <P> It is now great-exodus season for the Reagan Administration . Von Damm , who is personnel director for the President , heeded the warnings and prepared lists of possible replacements after the governmental churning . But Von Damm can not seem to capture a full-bodied great exodus . <P> The suspicion is growing that it may not come to be . One reason : for the first time since the days of John Kennedy , an extraordinary number of young people are aware of just how much fun it can be to serve their country , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Watergate soured a generation on governing . The Reagan revolution holds out the prospect of change to people of all political persuasions ( those in like it , those out want to be in to stop it ) . And big political and governmental movement is tremendously exhilarating . <P> Not long ago , Secretary of the Navy John Lehman , 40 , swooped onto the aircraft carrier Midway in the Sea of Japan . As he settled on the flight deck in his A6 , it occurred to him that the keel of that ship was laid a year after he was born . Now he was managing the Midway and her sister ships , helping to devise a new American defense . " I could go out and make money , " he mused . But then , with great relish , he added : " It would not be one-tenth as much fun . " <P> A few weeks ago , Peter McPherson , 41 , was breakfasting in Beirut when there was a shattering explosion in the air . He leaped to his feet to watch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Reagan 's Special Representative for Relief and Reconstruction in Lebanon came home . Raised on a Michigan farm of 500 acres , McPherson now tends U.S. aid in 60 countries round the globe . <P> Robin West 's father is a Pennsylvania banker used to dealing in tens of millions . The son , now 36 and an Assistant Secretary of the Interior , helps manage a budget of $6 billion and devised the offshore-oil leasing scheme that produced up to $10 billion in federal revenues last year . A while back , West flew over Alaska 's Beaufort Sea , the site of oil exploration , and decided he was in the middle of one of the last great Western adventures . " My God , " he said , " it is exhilarating ! " <P> David Gergen , 40 , the White House communications director , is pondering his future after seven years with three different Presidents . He planned to stay with Reagan for six months , and still is there . Why ? " Because , " he said , " there is , after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work again . " There is , too , the grandeur and sweep of the office . " It came home to me , " recalled Gergen , " on the day we had breakfast at the Versailles economic summit , met with the Pope in Rome at noon and had dinner with the Queen at Windsor . "
