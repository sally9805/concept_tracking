Play ball ! John Sayles , who has respectfully looked at hard-working people in Harlem and Appalachia in films like " The Brother From Another Planet " and " Matewan , " has lovingly turned his attention to underpaid workers in another corner of America - baseball. // In " Eight Men Out , " an Orion Pictures release scheduled to open Friday , Mr. Sayles has dramatized Eliot Asinof ' s book about eight members of the Chicago " Black Sox " who conspired to lose the 1919 World Series. // Since writing the script 11 years ago , Mr. Sayles grappled with the common wisdom that baseball movies are hard to get right , that not enough moviegoers are caught up in the daily melodrama of box scores and broadcasts and going out to the ball park. // However , the production of " The Natural " a few years back and this summer ' s success of " Bull Durham " may indicate that baseball is an excellent vehicle for telling American stories , that ballplayers may indeed be our modern samurai , the late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a western , " Mr. Sayles said recently . " Even though there haven ' t been as many baseball movies , baseball is familiar to people. " // Just as audiences are comfortable with the trappings of westerns - the dusty main street , the hitching post , the swinging doors of the saloon , the cavalry chase - so , Mr. Sayles reasons , will they be familiar with a catcher glowering behind his mask at betrayal by his teammates or a batter who strokes a vital base hit and curses at himself. // Watching " Eight Men Out , " even a moviegoer who doesn ' t know a double play from a doubleheader will feel the bond between the naive Buck Weaver ( John Cusack ) and his wife ( Barbara Garrick ) as he tells her the Series is fixed , or the tenderness between haunted Ed Cicotte ( David Strathairn ) and his unsuspecting wife ( Maggie Renzi ) as she rubs his weary arm before a game he must lose. // " Baseball is still kind of the game of your youth , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Out " as the sportswriter Ring Lardner , to whom he bears an uncanny resemblance . " Basketball has made some inroads , and football , your body really just gets big enough when you ' re in junior high school . The corporateness of pro football , the hype , has started to get on people ' s nerves . They got glutted with football. // " But little kids play baseball first . You can imagine you ' re doing it like a big-leaguer . It ' s fun . I think little kids like rules , like rituals . The endless arguments . Dramatically , there are pauses . The pitcher ' s got to pitch it , the batter ' s got to bat it , hundreds of times a game. // " Also , I think there are so many baseball movies coming out now because the directors are around my age , and baseball was the big sport of our youth. " // Mr. Sayles is hoping that non-fans in North America and Europe will follow this classic story of temptation and corruption . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the game after 1920 , while the owners prospered and the gamblers like the notorious Arnold Rothstein went their separate ways . Many new details were uncovered by Mr. Asinof , a novelist and former minor-league player , in his 1963 book . ( Mr. Asinof plays a bit role in the film , appearing as John Heydler , president of the National League . ) " Eliot said that when he first started researching it , as far as he was concerned , these guys were bums ; they sold out , " Mr. Sayles said . " But as Eliot started to learn more , he couldn ' t keep this simplistic view any more . He felt things were more understandable ; some of them were bums , some of them were not . This was a complicated world . Other people were guilty and implicated . He began to understand how one could do it , knowing where the guys came from. " // Mr. Sayles ' sympathies for the athletes are evident from the beginning of the film when even the ringleaders among the players @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a pennant-winning team . They are young men who love playing ball , being in the limelight , escaping the mills and the farms. // Mr. Sayles clearly identifies with the poor of Harlem and miners in West Virginia . A rugged athlete from Schenectady , N.Y. , he worked in factories and hospitals to put himself through Williams College and to support his early career as novelist and **27;110860;TOOLONG // While other film people may have a tropism for the Hollywood hills and the nearest hot tub , Mr. Sayles still lives in Hoboken , N.J. , and watches movies at the Secaucus mall. // From his modest office in Manhattan ' s garment district , he sees black and Hispanic and Oriental workers at sewing machines , and he gives a learned , passionate narrative of how the gambler Rothstein helped gangsters infiltrate the unions . ( " Rothstein was a genius . He should have gotten the MacArthur grant if they had it back then , " muses Mr. Sayles , who received the five-year , $170 , 000 fellowship for " outstandingly talented and promising individuals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , during a recent interview , the " Black Sox " have much in common with the seamstresses across the narrow street. // " These guys were making more money from off-season jobs than they were playing for Charles Comiskey , " he said , referring to the penurious White Sox owner . " It wasn ' t like most of them were coming from a college background . They were neighborhood guys who had been playing in industrial leagues against barnstorming teams . You made a couple of bucks , a keg of beer , and if you signed for the minors , they made good money off you . Yeah , you made more money in the majors , but it wasn ' t that much bigger. // " They were coming from the real world and they were rough guys . When I started reading history books for my screenplay , I realized that Ring Lardner and James T. Farrell and Damon Runyon were not exaggerating . These guys were Looie the Lug . They were considered trash , and most hotels wouldn ' t take them. // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ putting it in context . I once thought of doing a screenplay on a Boston police strike in 1920 . Sacco-Vanzetti in 1921 . Big things were happening in the country . Socially and morally , it was a lot like 1968 . Automobiles were like dens of sin . Kids could go out and do things they couldn ' t do in the parlor. // " There was pressure to modernize , go crazy , go wild . Then you had the backlash . Prohibition . The Palmer raids . The whole idea of coming back from war . How ya gon na keep em down on the farm after they ' ve seen Paree ? All those kinds of things . I see it as a period of America going from its childhood to its adolescence. // " Adolescence can be an exciting time but it can also be a cynical time . I felt like the ' Black Sox ' scandal was one of the last nails in the coffin that put America in the cynicism of the jazz age . ' Hey , everything is fixed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go to a speakeasy . Everybody ' s corrupt . ' Here ' s a story about a team , a group of guys . This is a turning point in their lives and also in the young kids who want to see them as heroes. " // In " Matewan , " which received fine reviews but was crowded by the glut of films last September , the source of the miners ' oppression is traced only as far as a sadistic private detective . But in " Eight Men Out , " Mr. Sayles presents the owner , the gamblers , the league officials and the new commissioner , all exploiting the rough-hewn athletes , who were so dominated by " the great American game " that they did not even arrange for private legal help. // " In West Virginia , you ' re surrounded by mountains ; there ' s always that feeling of claustrophobia , " Mr. Sayles said . " Matewan was more like the old West than the jazz age . Things that are happening in Chicago take another 40 years to reach Matewan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this film there are few confrontations . It ' s like Buck Weaver says , ' The guys don ' t even look at each other. ' " // There are a few warnings during the Series . On a swaying train between cities , the columnist Ring Lardner sings a sarcastic ditty of " I ' m Forever Blowing Ball Games " to players and officials . But nobody can stop the bumbling conspiracy. // Adhering faithfully to the facts of Mr. Asinof ' s book , Mr. Sayles shows John Cusack as Buck Weaver , the third baseman with a love affair with his sport , refusing to participate in the fix after sitting in on one plotting session . The screenwriter and athlete and romantic in Mr. Sayles make him wish he could have written a speech for Weaver saying , " Guys , I ' m not in . " Or Mr. Sayles would have had Weaver going to the suspicious manager , Kid Gleason - " Not to rat on the guys , just to say , ' Stop it. ' " // It didn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out in the World Series loss to Cincinnati and kept his mouth shut and suffered the rest of his life for it . Mr. Sayles believes he should have been reinstated after one year. // " Corruption and cynicism is not a black-and-white thing , " Mr. Sayles said . " It ' s like ' Prince of the City ' or ' Serpico . ' A kid who is a rookie doesn ' t say , ' Oh , I want to make the major leagues because in four years I can play in a World Series and sell out . A cop doesn ' t go to the police academy so he can arrest drug dealers and sell the drugs . A guy isn ' t just a bum . But he walks into a much bigger world , a bigger system , and you ask yourself , ' Why did he do it ? ' " // After reading the Asinof book , Mr. Sayles felt challenged to make a film that would not remind anybody of the old baseball movies with Jimmy Stewart , Gary Cooper , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // " I thought of all the old William Bendix movies , " he said , alluding to " The Babe Ruth Story , " and adding , " Even ' The Jackie Robinson Story ' was a grade-B movie without much effort , the second or third movie on a billing. " // Perhaps it is good that Mr. Sayles did not get to do his long-anticipated film until last summer , because he believes his skills as a director are still growing , at the age of 37 : // " Being able to pre-plan , leaving yourself some room for improvisation . Editing in your head so you don ' t need a perfect take . Anticipating technical problems . For ' Matewan , ' I was able to move around with Haskell Wexler " - the director of photography - " and see where the sun would be at different parts of the day . With Bob Richardson on this film , I was able to say , ' This is how the sun moves across the stadium . By evening , we ' re shooting to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' I ' ve learned not to take the word of experts . Now , if they say I ' ve run out of light , I say , ' What can I give up and get the scene shot ? ' When we were filming ' Brother ' in four weeks , I got caught with no time to light it up. " // Mr. Sayles filmed some scenes of " Eight Men Out " in Cincinnati , but all the game action takes place in Bush Stadium in Indianapolis , alternately transformed into ball parks in Chicago and Cincinnati . ( On all scenes shot from the dugout , he had to place a coach on the steps to block a light tower from last summer ' s Pan-American Games . ) For authentic baseball skills , Mr. Sayles enlisted Ken Berry , once a slick major-league outfielder , to coach the actors , most of whom had played some baseball . D. B. Sweeney , who plays Shoeless Joe Jackson , is a " softball rat " who plays in several Manhattan leagues. // " There ' s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " and the studios are trying to get them into as many movies as they can . Where do guys congregate ? In the military and sports. " // Charlie Sheen , perhaps the biggest " name " actor in the film , playing Happy Felsch , the center fielder , has said , " I didn ' t take this part as a career move . It ' s a chance to play in the World Series. " // The baseball fan will realize these are not Frank Viola and Keith Hernandez throwing and hitting , but the action is realistic enough because Mr. Sayles practiced and filmed entire sequences , rather than faking segments of the same play. // Mr. Sayles believes the success of " Bull Durham " has been a good sign for him and his producers , Sarah Pillsbury and Midge Sanford. // " Orion had turned this down because Sarah , Midge and I didn ' t have that much of a track record , " Mr. Sayles said . " When Kevin Costner said yes to ' Bull Durham , ' they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do it . Then they got more interested in this. // " But ' Bull Durham ' is a comedy , and this is not . I don ' t think real baseball fans will say , ' Oh , I ' ve seen my baseball movie for the year ; I won ' t go to another one . ' I think the real effect of ' Bull Durham ' doing well is that there are two or three other baseball movies " - " Shoeless Joe " and " Stealing Home , " to name a couple - " that have been in the works , and now they all got the green light. " // Mr. Sayles is not sure if he wants to see the green light too soon again . After struggling to make films that have become cult classics like " Return of the Secaucus Seven , " " Lianna , " " Baby , It ' s You , " " Brother " and " Matewan , " he is ready for a rest. // " So many people in film , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do one for more money , " Mr. Sayles said. // " I ' m glad I ' m not hooked into that system . It gives you more freedom. " // Although Mr. Sayles has built a reputation for making cult films on tiny budgets , - " Matewan " cost $4 million and " Eight Men Out " cost over $6 million - Mr. Sayles said , " Both were period epics , hard to do in seven or nine weeks , and I ' ve always come in just about on schedule . The next time I ' d like to do something contemporary and a little smaller in scope. " // While waiting to see how his most expensive project does , Mr. Sayles is not exactly settling into a hot tub . He will write a screenplay for Bille August , the Danish director , about the American Abraham Lincoln Brigade that fought in the Spanish Civil War , and he plans to finish a novel about Cubans who settled in Miami. // But if audiences are ready for a taut American drama that just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be in more demand than ever . And that , as they say in the dugout , could be a whole new ball game. //
