Despite assertions by Israeli officials during the last 10 days that the Beirut Government has endorsed a working paper setting forth Israel ' s main points , Defense Minister Ariel Sharon is reported to have failed , in a trip to Beirut late last week , to get a Lebanese signature on the document. // And officials here now say that Moslem figures in the Lebanese Government , including Prime Minister Shafik al-Wazzan and others , are resisting key elements of an accord for fear it would damage Lebanese ties with the rest of the Arab world , just at a time when considerable infusions of oil money are needed for economic recovery and reconstruction . Informed officials in Jerusalem expect the talks to take at least two months , and possibly much longer . <> <> U.S. Viewed as Dubious // In addition , there is a vague sense in Israeli political circles that the United States is somewhat cool to Israel ' s desire for an immediate accord on normalization , fearing that it would contribute to further internal strife in Lebanon , which could open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By contrast , Israeli officials have argued to their Lebanese contacts that only Israel is in a position to render decisive help to Lebanon , both internally and externally. // Israel can work to stabilize President Gemayel ' s Government , the officials contend , by continuing to arm and train the Christian Phalangist militia as his most dependable military force against other armed factions . The Lebanese Army , while receiving military aid from the United States , would presumably be neutralized in any domestic warfare , as it was in the civil war of 1975 and 1976 ; the Phalangist-led militia known as the Lebanese Forces will not be disbanded or incorporated into the army , the officials say , although it may undergo a name change. // Externally , the officials argue , only Israel can present a credible deterrent to any effort by Syria or the Palestine Liberation Organization to rebuild bases or renew influence in Lebanon . <> <> Support in Beirut Reported // The Israelis say that their arguments have found support among some of President Gemayel ' s aides and advisers , including one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an intermediary between him and Israel . It was this confidant , a man who has the President ' s ear and can argue and persuade him , who reportedly conveyed his agreement with the Israeli working paper . Officials decline to name him. // Defense Minister Sharon ' s public mention of the document 10 days ago is seen here as having embarrassed President Gemayel , who had apparently told very few of his own officials about its existence . But the publicity - evidently motivated partly by Mr. Sharon ' s interest in gaining political stature at home - also forced it onto the table , in effect , possibly reducing the danger of its simply fading from sight. // The document is reportedly based on a Cabinet resolution of Oct. 11 setting forth Jerusalem ' s desires for a signed agreement with Lebanon . Its provisions cover three broad areas : normalization , security arrangements within 25 miles of Israel ' s northern border and the withdrawal of Israeli , Syrian and P.L.O. forces . <> <> End of State of War Sought // According to senior Israeli officials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see an explicit renunciation of the 1949 armistice agreement , which followed the 1948 Middle East war , as a basis of Israeli-Lebanese relations . Instead , a statement of nonbelligerency , " to end the state of war , " is desired . This would be short of the peace treaty that Israel originally wanted , but which the Begin Government realized it could not get after the assassination last September of President-elect Bashir Gemayel . His brother , Amin , is regarded here as weaker and less willing to sacrifice ties with the Arab world. // The Israeli goal at this stage is the creation of a de facto peace and the skeleton of a diplomatic relationship , including an Israeli representational office in Beirut - the embryo of an embassy - and a border open to trade and tourism . These exist now , more or less . An Israeli office is situated in Baabda , a Beirut suburb , and since Israelis control the border , they allow some trade and tourism ; about 2 , 500 Lebanese crossed into Israel during Christmas week , many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // An official here reported that President Gemayel had suggested that the border be supervised by United Nations observers as a " fig leaf " covering official Lebanese involvement . <> <> Proposals for Security Zone // The security arrangements would apply to a swath of Lebanese territory reaching about 25 miles from Israel ' s northern border . There , Israel wants no United Nations or multinational force , but only Lebanese Army and police forces , without any artillery , rocket launchers , antiaircraft missiles or fortifications . Three Israelimanned ground stations would be established to monitor troop movements , and Israeli aircraft would conduct reconnaissance flights. // Israel advocates a prominent role for the militia of Saad Haddad , a former Lebanese Army officer who has received Israeli weapons since the civil war . One thought is to integrate the militiamen as a local unit of the Lebanese Army , although officials in Beirut are reported to oppose any role for Major Haddad himself , since he is a deserter. // Furthermore , many Shiite Moslems in the south , who have their own leadership and self-defense force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likely to be a point of discord in the Lebanese-Israeli talks. // Israel has made the withdrawal of its army contingent upon the departure of the P.L.O. from all of Lebanon , and the return of all Israeli prisoners and all bodies of Israeli dead . Then Israel would begin to pull out simultaneously with Syria , officials explain , possibly in a two-stage withdrawal , beginning with an Israeli pullback from the Shuf Mountains to the 25-mile line as Syria withdrew from the mountains into the Bekaa region in central Lebanon . <> <> Direct P.L.O. Contacts Denied // Informed officials here deny a report in Newsweek that Israel has had direct contacts with the P.L.O. on the prisoner issue ; rather , according to one senior official , the Austrians were asked to act as intermediaries. // Jerusalem does not have a clear reading of the Syrian position . Israel has information that Moscow is pressing Syria to stay in Lebanon to deny the United States an easy diplomatic accomplishment . Simultaneously , Washington is reportedly pressing Saudi Arabia to offer huge amounts of money to Syria to pull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to replace its losses during the war in Lebanon. // Israeli officials have said since the war began that while they were anxious to have Syria out , they were wary of giving Damascus veto power over their own withdrawal . Therefore , while the official Israeli position continues to demand a simultaneous Syrian departure , the Begin Government is said to be sensitive to the possibility that some Israeli move may have to be made unilaterally. // Consequently , one official speculated that once an agreement with Lebanon is signed , Israel might - in the absence of a Syrian withdrawal - pull back to the 25-mile line , leaving only a skeletal force or a proxy , presumably Major Haddad ' s militia , to control the region . Such a situation could even last a long time , the official noted , resulting in the effective partition of Lebanon. //
