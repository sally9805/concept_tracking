Adelaide Stiles , 60 , left her home in Fort Lauderdale one day eleven years ago to take a vacation with her boyfriend Michael Burnett . She was never seen again . Ever since , Burnett , 57 , a swindler with a long record , has been suspected of killing the wealthy divorcee after embezzling her money . But police were unable to tie him to the disappearance until Vernon Frazier , an inmate in a San Diego jail , learned that Burnett had become a protected FBI informant playing a crucial part in municipal bribery investigations in New York City and Chicago . <P> Last week Fort Lauderdale detectives finally charged Burnett , Frazier and an accomplice with the murder of Stiles . The source for the long-sought evidence was Frazier , who admitted to police that the trio lured Stiles onto a yacht , bludgeoned and shot her , then dismembered her corpse and fed it to sharks .
