F. Charles Gilbert , Deputy Assistant Secretary of Energy for Nuclear Materials , said in an interview that a 15-year plan for warhead production would require a substantial expansion of the nation ' s capacity to produce plutonium and tritium , two of the critical materials used in making atomic weapons . The plan is to be submitted soon to President Reagan , who is expected to approve it. // The expansion is a result of the Administration ' s reported decision to build an estimated 17 , 000 nuclear warheads over the next several years to supplement and replace the current stockpile of an estimated 25 , 000 weapons . The estimate is based on calculations using information from the Defense Department ' s budget and programs. // // Figures ' Within the Ballpark ' // One Government official familiar with the weapons projection described as " within the ballpark " the accuracy of the estimates , which have been made by the Arms Control Association , a private Washington-based group that favors arms control , and others , although the Pentagon itself does not publish figures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Resources Defense Council , a Washingtonbased environmental group that opposes the development of nuclear weapons , said that the stockpile would be expanded over the next decade by about 14 , 000 weapons , which did not take into account subsequent requests for weapons. // The expansion in warhead production , the largest in 20 years , would provide warheads for a new generation of weapons being developed by the military , including the MX intercontinental missile , a new submarine-launched Trident missile and hundreds of cruise missiles. // Mr. Gilbert said that if the new plutonium production goals were approved by Mr. Reagan , as expected , the Energy Department would require a budget supplement for the fiscal year 1983 of " several hundred million dollars " in addition to the $1. 04 billion the Administration has already requested for weapons material production . The $1. 04 billion request is $170 million higher than last year ' s materials production budget of $904. 4 million. // Mr. Gilbert outlined several of the alternatives being weighed by his agency for increasing plutonium stocks , two of which were listed , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unveiled last month. // However , he said that the Administration " would not require " and " has no intention of using " fuel from commercial reactors in the weapons program. // The proposal to recycle commercial fuel for use in atomic weapons , which had been championed by the Energy Department , had stirred strong opposition in Congress . Critics there have argued that it would blur the customary distinction between military and civilian use of nuclear fuel and undermine the nation ' s nonproliferation objectives. // The Senate last year approved a measure to prohibit the use of spent fuel from civilian nuclear power plants for making military weapons . But the provision , which had been sponsored by Senator Gary Hart , Democrat of Colorado , was deleted in November in a House-Senate legislative conference . However , the conferees said in their report that they supported continued separation of the military and civilian nuclear programs , and Senator Hart plans to reintroduce the measure next month. // Mr. Gilbert said the department was reviewing several ways of expanding plutonium supplies by building new production facilities or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the latter , he said , would be to change the design of reactors at the department ' s aging Savannah River production facility in South Carolina to provide for more efficient loading of the reactor cores . <> <> ' Substantial Undertaking ' // Mr. Gilbert acknowledged , however , that this method was " a substantial undertaking " that would require an increase of " several hundred million dollars " over the requested financing levels. // He said the agency was also considering ways of increasing plutonium production at reactor at Hanford , Wash. , known as the N reactor . . This could be done by increasing the levels of power at which the reactor operates or by blending an increased amount of very pure plutonium with lower-grade plutonium made for the fast breeder reactor program. // In addition , Mr. Gilbert said the agency was exploring the acceleration of a program designed to use lasers to separate plutonium from nuclear fuel . But he stressed that this controversial technique , if accelerated , would not be used to separate plutonium from commercial reactor fuel , only from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new $5 billion production reactor would probably be needed . However , he denied a report that Energy Secretary James B. Edwards had already promised Senator James A. McClure , Republican of Idaho , the chairman of the Senate Energy Committee , that the new reactor would be in his home state. // The measures Mr. Gilbert outlined go beyond those he described in Senate testimony last fall , most of which were initiated by President Carter and have already been financed by Congress. // The Government , for example , is modernizing the Savannah River site , and one reactor there , closed since 1968 , is being restarted , at a total cost of about $600 million over six years . In addition , a reactor at Hanford now making fuel-grade plutonium is being converted , at a cost of $160 million , to produce material for weapons . Some fuel is already being blended , and research on separation with lasers is well under way. // Nevertheless , Mr. Gilbert said that what he called the " ingoing numbers , " those contained in the new planning document @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increase planned in a previous stockpile memorandum signed by President Carter in October 1980. // Pentagon officials noted that it was Mr. Carter who began the substantial buildup in military forces that has required increased plutonium and tritium supplies . President Reagan , the officials said , was merely continuing and accelerating that trend. // Plutonium is used either in fission weapons or as a trigger in thermonuclear weapons . Tritium is used as the fusion material in a thermonuclear weapon. // The amounts of plutonium and tritium needed for planned and stockpiled weapons are secret . But officials familiar with the new planning document said that the new production goals would approximately double the rate of plutonium produced in the Carter Administration. // Thomas B. Cochran , a staff scientist with the National Resources Defense Council , a Washington-based environmental group , criticized the way in which stockpile memoranda and plutonium requirements in general were estimated. // " There ought to be a public assessment of and debate about the need for new weapons materials , " he said . " The armed forces hands in a weapons wish list @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ material will be needed for these arms. " //
