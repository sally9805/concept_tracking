In his job as chief network engineer for the General Services Administration , Sureshar Soni helps analyze costs for the vast federal telephone system used by 1.3 million Government workers . Because the GSA is preparing to replace that system for the first time since 1963 , a deal worth up to a whopping $25 billion for the companies that will build the new network , Soni was destined to play a significant role . Instead he is embroiled in a byzantine scandal that is paralyzing the giant phone project . According to investigators for the GSA and a Senate committee , Soni leaked secret bidding information in a mysterious pattern that may take probers months or years to untangle . <P> The phone mess is frustrating not only the Government but also the 14 corporations eager to snare a piece of the project , called FTS-2000 , for Federal Telecommunications System . As the largest telecommunications contracting job in U.S. history , the proposed deal has attracted a Who 's Who of bidders that includes AT &T,; all seven local phone companies , MCI , GM/EDS , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old system with a showpiece network that will enable federal workers to transmit computer data , conduct video conferences at their desks , send facsimile images and even transfer funds . Says Fritz Ringling , a private telecommunications consultant : " Whoever builds this thing will win the bragging rights to the world 's most advanced telephone system . " <P> The trouble at the GSA apparently started last spring , when bidding began for a separate but somewhat related project , a $55 million contract to build a dozen telephone-switching installations . According to one of Soni 's co- workers , the engineer made photocopies at GSA headquarters of the confidential AT &T; bid documents on the switching devices . Soni allegedly leaked the information to two or more of the regional telephone companies competing against AT &T; for the jobs , thus enabling them to tailor their bids accordingly . He reportedly told an official of Southern Bell , a subsidiary of the regional BellSouth company , exactly how much the parent firm would have to bid in order to win . ( BellSouth denies adjusting its bids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessarily a champion of the underdog . On at least one occasion he shared information with AT &T; as well , though AT &T; claims the information was public and not particularly useful . When the GSA awarded the contracts last October , AT &T; was assigned to build five of the switches , while the other seven were divided among four Baby Bells  --  Pacific Telesis , Bell Atlantic , U S West and BellSouth . <P> What was in it for Soni ? GSA probers allege that he accepted free entertainment from bidders who eventually won . Officials of Southern Bell , for example , reportedly regaled him five times at restaurants in Atlanta and Washington . But investigators are not convinced that a few free meals explain Soni 's behavior . Some believe that since Soni seemed to leak information on an equal-opportunity basis , he may have been trying , in a perverse fashion , to save the Federal Government money by manipulating all of the potential contractors .                   @ @
