Although most analysts still said that the 1978 legislation abolishing 40 years of tight Federal control over fares and routes was sound public policy , even some of deregulation ' s most ardent supporters have begun to worry that a wave of mergers could result in cartel-like conditions , not unlike those that deregulation was intended to supplant. // There are signs , said Alfred E. Kahn , the man who was deregulation ' s leading architect as head of the Civil Aeronautics Board , that the industry may be headed toward " an uncomfortably tight oligopoly . " <> <> Antitrust Efforts // To avoid this , Mr. Kahn said that antitrust enforcement efforts must be stepped up by the Reagan Administration , which he said has been much too willing to approve airline combinations. // This view is shared by Representative Norman Y. Mineta , chairman of a House subcommittee on aviation . Mergers are being reviewed by the subcommittee " on a case-by-case basis , " said an aide to Mr. Mineta , a California Democrat. // The Transportation Department itself seemed to reflect this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form of a proposal by the Texas Air Corporation to acquire ailing Eastern Air Lines. // With the abolition of the C.A.B. , and its function of deciding which lines served which cities and what prices would be charged , even deregulation ' s proponents were surprised by the frenzy of competition that resulted . More than two dozen airlines were created from scratch , many new ticket options were offered for travelers and fares tumbled . During the past 10 years , the cost of the average air ticket has fallen about 20 percent , adjusted for inflation . <> <> Harm to Travelers // But this process has also had effects that many believe have harmed travelers . Various low-traffic cities have suffered some form of service reduction - usually because a switch to smaller planes has reduced the number of available seats - and routing for many travelers has become less convenient because of fewer nonstop flights . Such amenities as free drinks and baggage handling have also been reduced , a particular annoyance to passengers who are not benefiting from discounted fares. // And since the Government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been especially hard hit by competitive pressures . Some , including Braniff Airways and Continental Airlines , were forced to seek bankruptcy protection while trying to adapt. // Customers , including those of Frontier , have sometimes had to scramble to find alternative flights on short notice when some financial crisis forced wholesale cancellations. // " Travelers deserve something better than an unpredictable system , " complained Frederick C. Thayer , a professor of public affairs at the University of Pittsburgh , who insisted deregulation has been " a disaster from the beginning. " // Mr. Thayer and other critics also have argued that ferocious market pressures have resulted in compromises or oversights related to safety. // Moreover , the dizzying proliferation of various kinds of fares , even though generally lower , has been far from an unmixed blessing . This week , American Airlines , for example , offers 26 different fares between New York and California that range from $198 for an economy round-trip ticket purchased in advance and requiring a Saturday night stopover , to $1 , 470 for an unrestricted first-class round-trip ticket. // Travel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prices and conditions frequently makes it all but impossible to pick the one that is most favorable. // But these drawbacks and the upheaval now threatening the existence of Frontier , its People Express parent , Eastern and other carriers do not prove that deregulation is a mistake , many industry analysts said. // Other factors have been at work . One is the 1981-82 recession that caused a sharp reduction in air travel , especially on highly profitable business routes , such as New York-Chicago . Another is bad decisions by individual airline managements that may have done no better under the old system. // " It ' s hard to separate " the impact of the various forces , said John V. Pincavage , airline specialist at Paine , Webber Inc . " There ' s too much water under the dam. " // In the case of Frontier , he added , a once satisfactorily managed carrier with " reasonable " financial strength found itself run by overly ambitious new owners . In addition , Frontier was competing with two other airlines - giant United and a revamped , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the only city where more than two carriers compete this way. // " You talk about the ultimate rock and a hard place , these guys were there , " Mr. Pincavage said. // But while combinations have come to worry some industry watchers , others remain strong defenders of the deregulatory process . Mr. Kahn , now a professor at Cornell University and until this summmer a director of New York Airlines Inc. , a unit of Texas Air , said , " I do not think deregulation went too far . " And provided the antitrust laws are actively enforced , Mr. Kahn said , the industry could consolidate down to five or six major systems without becoming overly concentrated . He noted that there was plenty of competition in an auto industry of three major domestic producers even before the Japanese and other foreign makers made such inroads into the American market. // Because it is relatively easy both for new competitors to enter the business and for existing carriers to redeploy resources , said Lee R. Howard , executive vice president of Airline Economics Inc. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always there " to regulate the system if , for example , fares on a given route are raised too high. // But Mr. Howard admits " there are no guarantees " this will happen in " an area where there is no experience. " // Murray L. Weidenbaum , a former top adviser to President Reagan and a regulatory specialist at Washington University in St. Louis , acknowledged that deregulation has been " a mixed bag " but also dismissed fears that it would create acartel in a business in which entry remained relatively easy . And he pointed to figures showing no observable diminution in safety since passage of the Airline Deregulation Act. // While the toll has been heavy on high-cost airlines and their employees , he added , " On balance , the traveling public is in the winner category. " //
