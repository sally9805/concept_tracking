The Lair of the White Worm he first time is tragedy ; the second time is farce . The third , evidently , is a horror movie . The wonders of coincidence have given us Meryl Streep , falsely accused of demonism ; Carmen Maura , - struggling hilariously with the demons of love ; and Amanda Donohoe , vamp-. ing her way through a Satanist fantasy . All three , to borrow the title of Carmen Maura 's vehicle , are women on the verge of a nervous breakdown ? or at least on the verge of giving one to their audience . What 's curious is that the least successful of these three films should somehow be the most disturbing . A Cry in the Dark is more or less standard docudrama , based on the trials of Lindy Chamberlain ( Meryl Streep ) and her husband , Michael ( Sam Neill ) . In 1980 , the Chamberlains took their children camping at Ayers Rock , the Australian outback 's main tourist attraction . It 's an impressive spot , bleak and eerie , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One of these snatched the Chamberlains ' 9-week-old baby girl . The child was never found ; but that was only the beginning of the nightmare . On the flimsiest of evidence ? on no evidence , really ? Lindy Chamberlain was accused of having murdered her baby . The accusations at first were no more than gossip . Then they turned into persistent rumors in the media ; and finally they assumed the form of a criminal indictment . Chamberlain was brought to trial , convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment . At this point , one needs to say what this film does not entail . It is not an expos ? of a miscarriage of justice ( such as the recent The Thin Blue Line or last year 's far more compelling Who Killed Vincent Chin ? ) . It is not a story about victims of the media . It does not bring you very close to Lindy and Michael Chamberlain . It is not a fable about mob hysteria . A Cry in the Dark has elements of all these without fully realizing any one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intentionally , perhaps not  --  the film becomes an essay on the profound , mysterious , implacable power of stupidity . There simply is no reason ? at least , none the filmmakers have dramatized ? for Lindy Chamberlain to have undergone this ordeal . Fred Schepisi , as director and co-author of the screenplay , has provided some hints of an explanation : the eagerness of a less than competent police force to prove itself ; the media 's insatiable hunger for scandal ; an apparent mistrust of the Chamberlains ' religion ( Seventh Day Adventist ) . But these factors , at least as presented here , do n't begin to account for the way the accusations against Lindy Chamberlain took on a life of their own . This mystery is the film 's strongest attraction ? perhaps its only one . The Chamberlains , as characters , amount to little , since they are passive throughout . Something happens to them at Ayers Rock , and after that things just keep on happening to them ; at no point do they stop being acted upon and start to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stiff than he seems at the beginning ; Lindy eventually shows some talent for self-assertion . That 's it for human interest . As for the details of the case , Schepisi unfolds them in the workmanlike manner one would expect from the more uplifting made-for-TV legal dramas . Throughout the film , he throws in a repeated dolly-forward shot as his concession to style ; and that 's it for dynamism . Everything else is as conventional as the way the script lays out plot points . Given a summary of the Chamberlain case , you could just as well visualize the film yourself , without missing anything except the brown pageboy wig they 've plunked onto Meryl Streep 's head . And yet I think A Cry in the Dark will nag at me . Something horrendous happened in this case , something suggested in the many short scenes in which citizens of Australia ? from beer-guzzling roughnecks to matrons at their dinner tables 7- discuss the Chamberlains . Everybody seems to have been caught up in the case ; everybody had an opinion , and many of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an ordinary , sane-looking woman approach Lindy Chamberlain on the street and spit in her face . I wish Schepisi had found a way to concentrate on that woman and her feelings , rather than carpenter together yet another pedestrian , true-life story . But still , the woman was there . I will not forget the sight of her spittle , nor Lindy Chamberlain 's amazed laughter at her madness . In 1985 , when the Spanish filmmaker Pedro AlmodOvar first reached the United States , he:greeted the audience at a screening of What Have I Done to Deserve This ? by saying , " This is my fourth film , and-1 want you to tell me everything you do n't like about it . Be very frank , because I want my fifth to be exactly the film you want to see . " With his latest effort , Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown , the accommodating AlmodOvar may have succeeded . He has even translated his willingness to please into a self-portrait of sorts . Cruising through the film , in one of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dyed bright yellow and sculpted into a pompadour . He is the driver of the Mambo Taxi . His cab 's interior , as gaudy and overstuffed as the film itself , is decorated like a 1950s nightclub , outfitted with drinks , pharmaceuticals , all the latest glamour magazines , a sign reading " Thank You for Smoking " and whatever music you 'd like to hear ? although , as the cabbie says , mambo goes best with the decor . At one point , when Pepa ( Carmen Maura ) steps into the cab , she has been crying and wants eyedrops The cabbie is crestfallen ? it 's the one item he does not stock . But the next time the Mambo Taxi picks her up , when Pepa really needs the eyedrops , the driver is ready to hand them over with a smile . Does Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown really deliver exactly what you want ? Maybe not , but it tries hard , and with a truly generous spirit . One might read AlmodOvar 's attitude as crass show-biz cynicism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've described ; and , as a nonbeliever in What Have I Done , I was willing to grant him the role . So this review is a public apology for my private doubts If AlmodOvar is so eager to please , it is because he believes in the redemptive power of entertainment which is a lovely creed for a filmmaker . Indeed , entertainment is the theme of Women on the Verge Pepa is a TV actress , best known for portraying the mother of a serial killer . She also dubs the soundtracks of films , which is how she has met the philandering Ivan . His voice has seduced a million women ; and he has seduced Pepa in the flesh . Now that she has been abandoned , she starts to fall apart . Although she wants nothing more than to speak with Ivan , the coward wo n't even talk to her on the telephone . Is Pepa going to play out a Madrid version of Cocteau 's La Voix Humaine ? Not this actress . " I 'm sick of being good , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She puts on her tube skirt and high heels , prepares a pitcher of spiked gazpacho and ventures forth into the city , intending to track Ivan down . In this she is unsuccessful , but she somehow magnetizes any number of other people involved with Ivan , all of whom wind up in her apartment . Soon she is dealing with Ivan 's castoff wife , his stammering son , the son 's hard-faced girlfriend , a couple of policemen in search of Shiite terrorists , and a feminist lawyer . There is also her friend Candela ( Maria Barran-co ) , whose own crisis is so severe that her earrings , in the shape of little espresso pots , can barely stop jiggling . How does Pepa deal with all this ? She acts , of course , blithely and brazenly playing out whatever reality she requires at the moment . Though she may be on the verge of a nervous breakdown , she still can enjoy the experience . It is , after all , only theater  --  as the great salsa singer La Lupe tells us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rupturing with the entertainment of it all One can not discuss such a farce , with its love for show-business artifice , and not mention the word " camp . " Almodcivar 's is a gay sensibility , which treats women and their emotions as if they were artifacts from a Joan Crawford movie . In many cases , that would translate into condescension . But Almo &war,; unlike less talented campers , seems to like women as much as their images . Although Pepa goes through her share of indignities in the course of Women on the Verge , one never feels that she , or Carmen Maura , is a victim of the filmmaker . Rather , Maura appears before us as Almodcivar 's collaborator . She is on screen for virtually the entire eighty-eight minutes , carrying the picture all the way . Some critics have noted with displeasure that AlmodOvar 's films never acknowledge Spain 's history . They show us a Madrid that never knew Franco . For my part , I can not consider this a fault . AlmodOvar has in fact filled his work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the conviction that laughter and play are liberating . The entertainer , happy to give you whatever you desire , heals through generosity ; his silence damns more thoroughly than any curse . Of this year 's Halloween offerings , my favorite by far was The Lair of the White Worm . It gives us Ken Russell in a restrained mood : nothing but some vampirism , a castrated Boy Scout and a choir of impaled nuns . Except for that , it 's pretty tame ? although there is a crucifixion-rape sequence and a sexand-death fantasy set in an airplane . But that 's it , really . Just that and somebody 's mother being hacked in two  --  by the good guy  --  and a scene where a policeman-turned-reptile dances to a bagpipe . Did I mention the part about Oscar Wilde ? The occasion for these shenanigans is Russell 's adaptation of a novel by Bram Stoker . He has updated the story to the present , setting it in a rural corner of Thatcher 's England where unemployment and anomie are somehow not in evidence , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of D'Ampton Manor feels free to daily with the lasses on Mercy Farm and to tease the Scots commoner visiting his fief . He does not realize that the commoner , an archeologist , has dug up something evil , nor does he know that his only fellow aristocrat in the neighborhood , the mistress of Temple House , happens to be high priestess to the monster . Sporting a wonderfully slinky wardrobe and a great pair of fangs , Amanda Donohoe slithers through the film with barely suppressed glee , alternately dropping herpetological puns and spitting venom . She seems not merely cold-blooded but ultimately as hermaphroditic as an earthworm . Neither female nor male herself , she impartially accepts both men and women as sacrifices to her god , Just so long as they are virgins . Perhaps it is this disdain for sexual difference that inspires her at one point to quote Wilde  --  who was himself likened to a great white caterpillar by one of his less admiring acquaintances . Is Russell letting us know on which side his sympathies lie ? You bet . But this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more restrained performances , which means the subtext mostly stays where it belongs while the story charges ahead . Russell is not one to put himself at the service of his sources ; but in this case he gives Stoker 's novel its due . I suspect the author , showman as he was , would have been delighted . If The Lair of the White Worm is still playing in your neighborhood when Thanksgiving rolls around , you might treat the whole family . ?
