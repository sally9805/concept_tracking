After a month , Clark and his new heart are making progress <P> Surgeon William DeVries was working in his office at the University of Utah Medical Center last week when he heard a faint but familiar swooshing sound . He looked up from his desk and was happily surprised to see his most famous patient , Dentist Barney Clark , roll into the room in a wheelchair . With a little assistance from his nurses , the world 's first recipient of a permanent artificial heart was enjoying an afternoon outing in the hospital corridors . A few feet behind Clark , and connected to his chest by two tubes , was the source of the noise : the power unit that has kept him alive for more than a month . <P> Although he is still listed in serious condition and has some lung and kidney problems , Clark is improving daily , according to the hospital . He has been moved from isolation to an intensive care unit , which he shares with other patients . Clark is frequently visited by his wife Una Loy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> Clark 's day begins at 8 a.m. when a nurse awakens him for a sponge bath and a series of tests . At least once every eight hours his blood chemistry , cardiac output and other vital signs are checked . After a morning visit from his doctors , Clark rests briefly and then is helped into an overstuffed recliner chair , where he sits until 5 or 6 p.m . His frequent catnaps are interrupted by two 20-minute sessions of exercises to strengthen his muscles and improve his circulation . <P> Clark 's mental progress , however , has not kept pace with his physical recovery . Though often able to converse with family members and doctors , Clark suffers frequent bouts of confusion . One hospital staff member reports that the patient sometimes thinks that he is still a dentist back in Seattle . Though tests have not detected any brain damage , Clark 's confusion probably stems from seizures he suffered one week after the implantation of his artificial heart . Utah doctors have conceded that there may have been an imbalance in the supply of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ balance is necessary to maintain normal brain function . <P> The artificial heart was working well last week , having beaten , or clicked , more than 5 million times . Part of the device had to be replaced when a valve broke two weeks after Clark 's original surgery , but Dr. Robert Jarvik , the heart 's designer , insists : " That was just bad luck . " There is , however , some discussion by the Utah heart team about using a different kind of valve in future models . <P> Though two Salt Lake City families have offered the Clarks the use of their homes , " Dr. Clark is not nearly ready to go , " says Hospital Spokesman John Dwan . The quality of the life he will lead at the end of a 375-lb. power unit remains a source of speculation and controversy , but at least one former critic has modified his views . " I must confess I am impressed with the results achieved so far in Salt Lake City , " says Dr. Denton Cooley , the famed Houston heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cumbersome device to " putting John Glenn in a rocket in 1950 and aiming him at the moon . " Jarvik feels that his invention has already proved its worth : " We have been able to offer at least one patient who was terminally ill a reasonable level of hope for a good life .
