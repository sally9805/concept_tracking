New appreciation for a great architect 's domestic interiors <P> A Frank Lloyd Wright Revival seems to be in the making . Exhibitions , symposia and books on the master 's volcanic life and titanic work proliferate . One of Wright 's two " Tree of Life " stained-glass doors brought $110,000 at Christie 's in New York City in May , a record for an American stained-glass panel . Starting next week , 100 of his architectural drawings will be offered at Manhattan 's Max Protetch Gallery for $7,000 and up . Wright buildings from coast to coast are being devoutly restored , the most important of them his first Home and Studio , on which construction began in 1889 in Oak Park , Ill . This boldly simplified yet intricate shingle-style house , along with 29 other Wright structures in its vicinity , attracts more than 30,000 admirers a year on organized tours alone . <P> Two or three decades ago , Americans regarded Wright ( 1867-1959 ) as their greatest architect mostly because of the furious stunts with which he reacted to the International Style-his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to build a mile-high skyscraper in Illinois . The present revival , however , focuses on Wright 's early domestic architecture , his houses and , significantly , their interior designs . Last year the Metropolitan Museum placed the reconstructed living room of his Francis Little House ( 1912-14 ) of Wayzata , Minn. , on permanent display , joining the Temple of Dendur and other landmarks of the march of civilization . Wright was despotically insistent on designing every interior detail of his houses , right down to flower vases and table linens ; he even wanted to redesign the telephone . <P> This aspect of Wright 's work is exemplified in " Frank Lloyd Wright and the Prairie School , " a show of more than 250 furnishings , drawings , photographs and documents that opened last week at New York City 's Cooper-Hewitt Museum , the Smithsonian Institution 's national museum of design . The exhibition , which will run until Dec. 31 , is an almost intimately informal survey of Wright 's brilliant beginnings , from his tracing of a Louis Sullivan ornament in 1892 to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1923 , which marked a new direction in his work . <P> Wright started not with a style but with an idea , a Weltanschauung , a principle , which he called " organic architecture . " What he meant by it was that humans are part of nature , subject to the laws , rhythms and mysteries of nature and happiest if they live in harmony with it , and their dwellings should reflect this unity inside and out . Wright 's canon of organic design ( which , being a loquacious and somewhat argumentative man , he often confused and even contradicted ) is no Thoreauvian Utopia . He shared the American faith of his time in the blessings of technology . " This thing we call the Machine , " he said in 1901 , " is no more or less than the principle of organic growth working irresistibly the Will of Life through the medium of Man . " But machine products , he believed , must be designed by artists . The objects on view at the Cooper-Hewitt remind us of what could be achieved with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
