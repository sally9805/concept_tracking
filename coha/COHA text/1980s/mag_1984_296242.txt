New York Governor Mario Cuomo , his wife Matilda , two of their children and the family dog were upstairs in the executive mansion in Albany last week when a neighbor , Julian Quarles , 25 , paid them an unexpected visit . Sometime between midnight and 7 a.m. , Quarles climbed a 7-ft. - high fence outside the house , broke a window to unlock the front door , and walked in , unnoticed by the two guards stationed outside . He took a video recorder , a silver punch bowl , two candlesticks , a tray , a coffee urn and two platters : <P> $5,000 worth of booty . <P> That evening Quarles , who lives in a dilapidated apartment building one block from the Governor , went back to the mansion and surrendered . He told police that he had originally intended to break into the house , awaken Cuomo and ask to be reinstated in his $7,500-a-year state job as a janitor , which he had lost in 1981 because of absenteeism . Once inside , Quarles became frightened and decided instead to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ items a few days later in the hope that the grateful Governor would reward him with a job . Cuomo , who rejected increased security as too expensive when he took office in 1983 , has ordered new safety precautions for the 40-room mansion .
