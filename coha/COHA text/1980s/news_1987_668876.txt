One hot summer night last year , Karen Wolin ' s boyfriend came over to her house unannounced and found her in bed with Ralphie . It could have been an ugly scene , recalls Wolin , a secretary with the Ringer Pharmaceutical Co. in St. Louis , if Ralphie hadn ' t immediately jumped out of bed and curled up on his rug in the corner . Ralphie , after all , is a very obedient cocker spaniel . Boyfriends and other skeptics notwithstanding , a lot of people sleep with their pets . It ' s one of the naked facts of life-and not much publicized either . " Probably the majority of pet owners do it , " says Micheal Fox , a Washington veterinarian and author of a nationally syndicated newspaper column . Sleeping with pets , he says , has history on its side . Dogs , for instance , were the first animal to become part of the family of man , sleeping by the mouth of the cave to fend off pests and warn of intruders . It was a pretty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dogs simply moved in . It ' s hard to say just who started the move on up to the bed-the animals or the owners . Fox says both are responsible . . . and responsive . Having animals sleep with us-whether in , on , under or near the bed-is just our mutually primal need for companionship , warmth , touching and security . " There ' s absolutely nothing psychologically unhealthy about it , " Fox says . In fact , it ' s vital for any social animal to feel " part of the pack , " says Tom Wolski , a veterinarian and animal behavior consultant at Cornell University and the owner of an Australian shepherd . Chaining a dog in the kitchen or locking it out of the bedroom at night tells the animal that it is an outsider , he says . " And why have pets to begin with unless you want to bond ? " His dog , Wolski admits , is " a nuisance on the bed , and he usually has dirty feet . " But he does stay in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for both of us . He doesn ' t have to be right on top of me . Also , he loves the smells in the bedroom : feet , dirty laundry , the bed . He feels right at home . " But then it ' s such an easy trade-off to make , says Michael Cable , director of the Hamilton Avenue Animal Hospital in Cincinnati . In exchange for a little mattress space , he gets undying homage from his two dogs and occasional homage from his cat ( mostly , he says , what he gets is half-dead field mice ) . " Few things in this world will love you as unconditionally as a dog , " Cable says . " Even if you just go to take out the garbage , they act like you ' ve been gone for a year when you come back in the house . How can you not like someone like that ? It ' s the cheapest form of love there is . So what does it matter where he sleeps ? " For some people , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become an indispensible part of the sleep ritual , like putting on her pajamas and setting the alarm clock . The relationship she has with her two cats , Basil Rathbone and Grey , goes back 10 years , so that their body rhythms have even come to coincide , all three going to bed at the same time . The two cats snuggle close , one on either side of her for warmth , and she is the central heating unit . " It can get a little tough to move , though , " Williams admits . For Basil and Grey , it ' s room and board . They get a bowl of water and a scratching post at the foot of the bed and breakfast in bed . The cats like to eat in bed , Williams says , and it ' s okay as long as it ' s not something they ' ve dragged in from the yard . And as long as she keeps feeding them cube steaks , as she does , why should they bother ? IDENTITY What does Williams get in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what are a few fleas between friends ? " But fleas may not be all you get from sleeping with your beasts . Though Cable seems to think there ' s more likelihood of contracting something from a person than a pet , there are , he concedes , still ticks , mites , ringworms , fleas and whatever dirt is on their paws when they climb into bed without washing their hands . Generally , Fox says , it ' s safe if the animal is healthy . Some people , however , are worried about a different kind of affliction : the animal ' s identity crisis . It comes from too much contact with people and not enough contact with one ' s own kind . Daryl O ' Connor , a technician at the Alameda East Veterinary Clinic in Denver , has a spaniel that sleeps with her regularly . So regularly , in fact , that she says it ' s almost turning into something of , " um , a person . " O ' Connor says she occasionally is too embarrassed to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She ' s not the kind you can say to , ' Go be a dog . ' She has to be with you all the time . " This is bad news , insists Cathryn Hilker , coordinator of education and outreach at the Cincinnati Zoo . " Animals get neurotic and goofy when they ' re so humanized , " she says . " They get hopelessly imprinted , and it can rob them of their own identity . " Sleeping on a Posturepedic under satin sheets with a snooze alarm , a bowl of juice nearby and a red sweater draped over the bedstead isn ' t exactly Hilker ' s idea of nurturing " an animal ' s own natural self , " what she refers to as " dogism , " " catism , " etc . Hilker , who has raised both domestic and wild animals ( cheetahs and cougars ) , argues that " a very young animal does require the closeness you robbed it of when you deprived it of its mother , and that may include allowing it to sleep on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You owe it that closeness . But beyond that , you should treat it more like its mother would in the wild . Let it be more on its own . " The name of the game in the animal kingdom is independence , and the sooner the better , " she says . " Nature has weaned animals from dependence for millions of years . Pet owners should do the same , even though the animal ' s survival may not depend on it . A full-grown anything should not be sleeping with its mother . " Hilker says that generations of inbreeding and domestication probably contribute to an almost genetic predisposition on the part of these animals toward people-identification , but she still contends that sleeping with your pet is " carving a round niche and stuffing a square animal into it . " If a pet doesn ' t know how to act and react when around members of its own species ( sniffing , circling , etc. ) , you ' ve probably overdone it on the imprinting , Hilker says . " It ' s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of us keep them close to us all their lives ; others let them go . " LOVE TRIANGLES Breaking pets out of the bedroom habit-as people often try to do when they get married , and it becomes a bit of a love triangle-can be quite a sport itself , says Richard Avanzino , president of the San Francisco Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals , who five years ago became the owner of a celebrated dog , Sido . The dog ' s owner declared in her will that Sido should be put to sleep . Avanzino challenged this in court and won a stay of execution . Sido , a shelty , is now his . " I could tell it was used to sleeping with its mistress , " Avanzino says . " When I ' d go to bed at night , she ' d climb into bed with me . But the bed is for my wife and me . The animals-two dogs and four cats-sleep around it . " They worked out a compromise , though . Sido is allowed on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to the rug . For the unrepentent pet lover , however , there ' s a vacation spot in Wabasha , Minn. , just for you . According to the July issue of Cats Magazine , when you resrve a room at the Anderson House , the oldest continuously operating hotel in the state , you can reserve a cat to sleep with , too , or as owner John Hall puts it , " a four-legged fur person bedwarmer . " There ' s no extra charge , but sorry , only one pet per customer. - CAPTION : DRAWING : Illustration by Steven Guernaccia . Illustration DRAWING <>
