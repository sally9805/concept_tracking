Party platforms , cooked in the high temperature of factional passions , quickly , grow cold as the real campaign begins . Voters would rather listen to live candidates than read moribund cliches . But last week , as Republicans finished drafting their 1988 document in New Orleans , G.O.P. leaders thought they had forged a workable weapon to use against the Democrats : the Heft Issue . <P> Democratic National Chairman Paul Kirk had created the opening . Kirk decided that a crafty way to debunk the charge that Democrats promise everything to everyone was to shrink the normally gargantuan party platform to a brief statement of principles . That seemed logical enough , but the ploy reinforced the claim by George Bush that Michael Dukakis is a " Stealth candidate " who ducks specific positions . So when Republican drafters went to work , they produced a 30,000-word monster , nearly ten times the size of its Democratic counterpart . <P> The platform bulges with specific assertions and pledges , most of them quite familiar . The G.O.P. is against : any species of tax increase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for : the Strategic Defense Initiative , a reduction in the capital-gains tax , the death penalty . <P> The urge to inject details led to some surprising provisions . In their final deliberations , the drafters added an item calling for a constitutional amendment to limit the number of consecutive terms served by members of Congress . Other passages hardly qualify as presidential : the Republicans would evict drug dealers from public-housing projects and encourage recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance in all schools . <P> With his representatives fending off pet proposals by both ultra- conservative s and the tiny progressive remnant , Bush got a platform very much in his own image . Thus armed , he plans to continue to use the stealth gambit against Dukakis . But in politics , as in war , every strategy evokes a response . In being so specific , the G.O.P. has promised potentially expensive goodies to various groups , such as tax breaks for certain oil producers and families that send their children to private school . Any moment now , the Democrats will tag the Republicans as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
