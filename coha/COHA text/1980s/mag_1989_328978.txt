At the Westerplatte Memorial , which marks the site of the first gunfire of World War II , Bush , draped in a large American flag by an exuberant Pole , reached into the crowd , picked up a small boy and hugged him as if he were one of his own eleven grandchildren . <P> In rainy Budapest , beneath the huge statue of Lajos Kossuth , Hungary 's greatest figure of independence , the President bounded down from the stage after brief remarks , stripped off his borrowed raincoat and wrapped it around a soaked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fend off other onlookers grabbing for her new prize . <P> On his way to speak at the Karl Marx University of Economic Sciences , Bush invited a couple of students into the presidential limousine ; one of them sported a power yellow tie , reflecting Alan Greenspan more than Karl Marx .
