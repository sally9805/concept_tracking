Do you see yourself as the President ' s press secretary or the press ' s press secretary ? // I see myself as the press secretary for the nation . People say you can ' t serve two masters . That ' s right . I have only one master  --  that ' s the President. // But I serve the President best by serving the press best . Where that comes out is that if you serve the President and the press , you serve the nation . The job here is to facilitate the conversation between the President and the people. // Have you , in the short time you ' ve held this position , said some things unintentionally that have led to stories that are incorrect ? // Sure . Anyone who would say that he hasn ' t done this in my position , well . . . Some of my job is to say what I have to say to the press in such a way that this won ' t come about. // I think it was a former defense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secretary had to lie to the press . Do you agree with this position ? // No , rather than lie I would take the Fifth Amendment to the US Constitution . But I will not say , " I will never lie to you . " That has a bad ring to it . Sometimes not to say anything seems to confirm something . And that becomes a gray area that is very touchy. // Do you see your jobs as that of putting the best face on information ? // The most accurate face on information . Information puts its own face on itself . There must be a place where you , the press , get straight answers to straight questions . That ' s what my job is all about. // But don ' t you have to admit that the President , like all president before him , is trying to manage the news ? // Yes , well I ' d say to intentionally try to go out to get a bad story would be foolish . What I want to add to that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out straight . If an effort is made on the press ' s part to play it straight  --  that is , that reporters take what we say and not twist it  --  that ' s what we are after . And if that ' s managing the news , well I ' ll accept that description of what we do. // Do you see the President at a certain time each day ? // I have my own meeting with him . Every day ; generally at 9 : 15 . And I ' ve been able to set that time . I want to see him early in the morning because I want to brief the press about 11 , if I can . I get in early , about 6 : 30 , so I ' ve had a chance to read and catch up on things and am ready to see the President. // Is he businesslike with you ? // No , he ' s very informal . I took karna deputy press secretary Karna Small in with me today . Karna was going to brief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to let her see him , too , in the morning. // Sometimes he sits behind the desk in the Oval Office , and we either lean on the desk or sit close around . But today he went over to the wing chairs , and we sat on the couch and talked back and forth. // He ' s always presidential , even within this context of informality . He ' s not afraid to make decision , and he ' s not afraid to all to do something that may in the short run be painful if he believes it to be the right thing to do. // Are we going to see further experimentation with press conferences ? Or have you got them the way you want them now ? // We are not running a race track . But we reserve the right to do a lottery again at some point. // The next press conference will be going back to what we did the first time . Just the raising of hands from the press . We just won ' t call on people who shout. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liked it  --  the quiet press conference . The press looked good . Politicians aren ' t the only ones who suffer from an image problem lem . And when the President and the press yell at each other , it doesn ' t help either in the eyes of the public. // What kind of a relationdhip do you feel you have with the press ? // It is beginning to sort out very well . AT first , there was a problem . We did change some things that had become ingrained . For example , we thought that reporters didn ' t have to run around here in tank tops and the like. // Has the post-Watergate adversarial feeling on the part of the press toward the office of the President ended ? And , if so , why ? // I think it has diminished but that it is still there . It ' s because there ' s a president here that the press knows doesn ' t have a paranoid bone in his body . They know that he likes the press . He likes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He loves the give-and-take. // What kind of press has the President had thus far ? // He thinks it has been positive . On balance , we have been reported fairly and we ' ve been reported accurately. // Have there been some stories that you and the President have questioned , where you think there was unfairness , or inaccuracy , or bias ? // There are individual ones , but you don ' t remember them . There isn ' t a mind-set in this presidency toward remembering what is said and written. // You could write something very critical about him . Maybe it would be right , maybe it would be wrong . Let ' s say , as a worst case , that it is wrong . It ' s like water off a duck ' s back as far as the President is concerned. // Then this President isn ' t going to have an ' enemies list ' among those in the news media ? // No. // But might there be some writers he won ' t read as quickly as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he likes to see is how stories are played . And he wants to see the unfavorable stuff , the stuff that ' s off the mark , because you have to remember that he is a communicator and he sees a failure on his own part if something that is written is inaccurate. // As you have grown to know the President better in recent weeks , what have you concluded that it is that really moves this man ? What ' s on his mind most of the time ? // He has set goals in this administration . And the goals are kind of like the North star that you ' re steering by . And , you know , there are fluctuations in the wind that try to take his eye off the goal . But he has had a built-in compass these 15 , 16years of knowing where he wants to go , the direction he wants to move the country . And even though people try to pull him away , he keeps right on going in that same direction . So that ' s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accomplishing those goals. // He would like to have a nation that is revitalized economically  --  a nation that regain its respect and prestige abroad. // //
