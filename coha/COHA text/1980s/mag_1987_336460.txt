The whir of wheelchair motors and chants of " We want access " filled the air last week , as some 200 disabled demonstrators from across the U.S. picketed the annual convention of the American Public Transit Association in San Francisco . The protesters blame association members for engineering the repeal of a 1979 federal mandate that required wheelchair lifts on all new buses and rail systems as well as the phased modification of existing systems . <P> On Powell Street some protesters chained their wheelchairs to the city 's century-old cable cars . Others crawled or rolled onto the tracks , shutting down the system for two hours . Many of the 134 arrested protesters were carted off in lift-equipped buses and vans .
