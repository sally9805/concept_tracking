" Frankie and Johnny in the Clair de Lune , " which opens the main-stage season of the Manhattan Theater Club , has the timeless structure of romantic comedies : Will there be a second night to this odd couple ' s problematic one-night-stand ? As one expects from Mr. McNally , the author of " Bad Habits " and " It ' s Only a Play , " the evening often floats by on bright and funny conversation , some of it dotted , however parenthetically , with jaundiced references to show business ( " The Sound of Music , " " Looking for Mr. Goodbar , " Kathleen Turner ) . But there has always been another side to Mr. McNally ' s highly lacquered sophistication : even his raucous gay-bath sex farce , " The Ritz , " had something poignant to say about transitory romantic attachments . In " Frankie and Johnny in the Clair de Lune , " the playwright examines his characters ' connections with a new forthrightness and maturity , and it ' s just possible that , in the process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about intimacy in the age of AIDS. // To be sure , " Frankie and Johnny " is not about AIDS per se . There is only one vague reference to the disease , and its characters do not belong to high-risk groups . Still , there ' s a pointed end-of-the-world feel to James Noone ' s drab tenement set and to the blank , Edward Hopper-esque solitude of the couple ' s existence . Mr. McNally seems to be taking stock of what ' s really important in a society where life can be " cheap and short , " where sexual marauding can no longer pass as its own reward , where emotional defenses are so well fortified that human contact is harder to achieve than ever. // The persistent , nosy Johnny is as obnoxious a suitor as Frankie says he is - he ' s the kind of guy who picks at any visible scab - but his relentless battering does make her and us think about how much of love is fleeting chemistry and how much is merely a willingness to overcome the inertia of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right when he says his and Frankie ' s only hope is that they somehow forget " the million reasons they don ' t love each other " and build instead on the few reasons that did bring them together , if only for an hour and by chance , on one desperate moonlit night . Perhaps , too , the durability of their bond will have less to do with their various similarities and differences of personality than with their ability to remember the " music " of their first , hungry romantic passion . Music - from that alluded to in the title to bits of Bach , Wagner and Frederick Loewe - figures throughout " Frankie and Johnny . " The play ' s offstage third character is a pretentious FM disk jockey who would " still like to believe in love. " // Mr. McNally may or may not still believe in love himself , but he has dexterously managed to avoid the tragic denouement of folklore ' s Frankie and Johnny ( and of his last and thematically related play , " The Lisbon Traviata " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comedies . In " Frankie and Johnny , " it ' s enough of a victory for the hero and heroine to share un-self-consciously the intimate domestic activity of brushing their teeth . But if the playwright avoids the trap of reaching for a definitive final curtain , he sometimes exerts too firm a controlling hand along the way . The hash-slinging characters both seem like second-hand William Inge-style Middle Americans - as if they were archetypal figures contrived to enact a parable rather than people drawn freely from life . Sometimes their credibility is further compromised by their slips into knowing badinage reminiscent of Mr. McNally ' s upscale Manhattanites. // Under the fine direction of Paul Benedict , two excellent actors supply the spontaneity and conviction needed to override the moments of contrivance in their roles . Mr. Welsh keeps us guessing as to whether Johnny is merely sickeningly sincere or a weirdo , finally allowing us to see and understand all the pieces of a complex , damaged man . While Ms. Bates ' s Frankie superficially resembles the suicidal daughter she played in " ' Night , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - a tough waitress whose wisecracks mask not a sentimental heart but an unsparing vision of the world . When Johnny tells her that he ' s a romantic who likes seeing things in a shadowy light , she typically snaps back that his idea of romance is her idea of " hiding something . " As it happens , we can understand both points of view in a play that brings fresh illumination to the latest phases of that old lovers ' moon . <> <> AFTER SEX , WHAT ? - FRANKIE AND JOHNNY IN THE CLAIR DE LUNE , by Terrence McNally ; directed by Paul Benedict ; sets by James Noone ; costumes by David Woolard ; lighting by David Noling ; sound by John Gromada ; production stage manager , Pamela Singer .
