Craig is also caught in a self-made dilemma . He has refused to go to the minor leagues , saying he can improve by practicing with the Boston Bruins . But he is also sending out signals that he might not want to be just another goalie and that it might be time to get on with the rest of his life . He can ' t have it both ways for long. // " I ' m not sure Jimmy wants to play next year , " says Bob Murray , Craig ' s attorney . " Jimmy is not unhappy with the prospect of not playing any more hockey . I ' ve felt since September that Jimmy might not play after this year. " // There is nothing wrong with contemplating a regenerating change in careers , but it is dangerous to play Hamlet in front of a full house in Boston , even if it is Craig ' s hometown . There is already some muttering that he is acting petulantly in refusing to sharpen his skills at Springfield. // Murray suggests Craig may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crowds chanted " U-S-A " after the victory over the Russians last February. // " For a lot of those players , there are problems getting motivated , " Murray says . " It wasn ' t just the Lake Placid thing ; it was the exhibition games . Herb Brooks worked those kids far beyond their physical capabilities . These players realize they are never going to work as hard , and that bothers them. " // Murray says he knows of other Olympians who feel disjointed in professional hockey , but he declines to name names . In a recent interview , both Dave Silk of the Rangers and Ken Morrow of the Islanders radiated a healthy motivation to improve their skills. // Jim Craig may be more sensitive , partly because a goalie receives more attention than any other player . He had reason to grow cynical when the Atlanta Flames used him to stimulate a dying franchise last March , but the Flames did give him time off when he suffered from nervous exhaustion . When the Flames moved to Calgary in the offseason , they traded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were not enamored with his long-range potential. // The trade should have made Craig happy , because he is close to his widower father and his seven brothers and sisters , from North Easton , Mass . He said he welcomed the pressure of playing in Boston , particularly after Gerry Cheevers , his idol , had moved from goalie to coach . And it is obvious the Bruins want Craig to succeed. // " If he wasn ' t who he was , even as early as training camp we might have been tougher , " says Harry Sinden , the general manager . " We wanted him to win the job - a local guy , an Olympic hero , a pretty good prospect . You overlook things , you turn the other cheek , but there wasn ' t much difference between him and the other guys below him. " // Craig was alternated with Rogie Vachon until early this month , appearing in nine victories , seven losses and six ties , approximately the same ratio as Vachon ' s 15-13-3 . But , Cheevers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technique. // " He has problems handling the puck when he comes out of the net , " Sinden says . " He tends to try to catch everything , which is understandable , because he has a great hand . We feel his legs are not quick enough , and he seems indecisive about when to come out or stay in the net. " // On Feb. 5 , the Bruins called up Marco Baron from their Springfield farm team , and they strongly suggested that Craig go down to work on his flaws . But , after a series of meetings with Craig and Murray , Sinden held back from ordering Craig to go. // " We ' re aware that Jimmy is different , " Sinden says . " I understand the hangover from the Olympic experience . But Jimmy ' s reasoning is not clear . I honestly believe he would quit if we tried to send him down . Jimmy says ' retire . ' I say ' quit.

Boston fans are very discriminating . They expect performance here . They ' ll miss Lynn and Burleson and Fisk , but they booed ' em when they didn ' t perform . The fans say they want apple pie , but if the apple pie isn ' t any good they ' ll want peach pie. " // Jim Craig seems to have discovered it is not much fun being as American as apple pie . He doesn ' t like the groupies who sneaked into his hotel room , or the fans who chatter at him while he ' s trying to eat in a restaurant , or the reporters who besiege him for interviews. // " I ' ve always wanted to make money , but since I ' ve had it I haven ' t felt any better , " Craig said not long ago . " You can ' t meet anybody without being suspicious .

But what exactly is Jim Craig ' s selfimage right now ? Sinden says Craig has been working hard in practice and showed major improvement on Thursday. // But Craig ' s attorney says : " I think Jim could give it up even if he played all 20 games the rest of the season . Jim could give it up . He has television possibilities and promotional opportunities . I think he feels he ' s accomplished what he ' s going to accomplish. " // Craig ' s hard work in practice indicates he has pride in remaining an athlete . If he wants to " retire " to spend time with his family , to take long walks on the beach , to appear at talk shows and businessmen ' s luncheons , that ' s all right , too . But he can ' t give signals he wants it both ways , not indefinitely . The fans in Boston will eat him up if they sense ambivalence. //  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
