But when the sun rises over the broad Han River - and the rolling valley where Seoul sits bathed in morning mist - it rises over a city vibrant with activity . Seoul ' s nine-lane avenues are frequently gridlocked . Aggressive bus drivers rival the most notorious in Rome . Screaming mopeds zip onto sidewalks and into alleys where hordes of international shoppers take advantage of some of the best bargains in Asia. // // ' ' My hometown has become a tangled colossus , ' ' laments Seoul-born Lee Sang Kyung . ' ' There is too much of everything - pollution , people , politics. ' ' // ' ' Twenty years ago , I left behind a peasant metropolis , ' ' adds Han Kim , a professor at the University of Michigan . ' ' I went back this year and thought I was in Europe. ' ' // He might have thought he was in Europe this past Sunday , too , when a terrorist bomb went off outside Seoul ' s Kimpo Airport . The city , proud host to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been trying to prevent precisely such attacks . South Korean officials promptly suggested North Korean involvement. // Meanwhile , the traffic jams here show that in South Korea , all roads - social , economic , and political - lead to Seoul . Growing tenfold in population since World War II , doubling in the last decade , this capital of one of Asia ' s so-called ' ' miracle ' ' economies has become the world ' s fifth-largest city. // ' ' In Korea now there is only Seoul , ' ' says Professor Kim , who has watched the phenomenal growth of the capital through annual visits spanning 20 years . ' ' Restaurants , nightclubs , shopping , cultural events - the other cities don ' t even compare. ' ' // The news that comes out of South Korea in the international press tells of political unrest . In Seoul alone , there have been 557 demonstrations this year against the government of President Chun Doo Hwan . Yesterday , about 2 , 000 students clashed with riot police in protest against the costly Asian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told : of how Seoul rose from the devastation of the Korean war ( 1950-53 ) to become a cultural and commercial giant . Through scrupulously orchestrated planning , South Korea has multiplied its gross national product 38-fold since 1961 , averaging 8 percent growth for 20 years . ( Since 1984 , there has been a slowdown in exports - which had soared from $119 million in 1964 to $32 billion in 1985 - but the impact has been eased this year with the help of low oil prices. ) // In the capital , a new middle class has emerged . And with its emergence , the face of the city - housing , office space , parks , and cultural centers - has been transformed . Now , with the Asian Games and the Olympics , Seoul is capping three decades of growth with a final housecleaning . The goal is to put the best foot forward for international visitors and the news media. // Kim Zohng Chill , acting president of the Korean National Tourism Corporation , points from the eighth-floor window of his downtown office , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ projects that are 75 percent completed. // Next to the slow-moving Han River are huge piles of sand . They have been dredged up in an antipollution project that has changed the river from a virtual city sewer to a recreational waterway ( ' ' Fishable now , swimmable by 1987 , ' ' Mr. Kim says ) . River-polluting factories have been relocated , and the river has been lined with hundreds of sports parks and picnic areas. // Around one bend in the river is a 40 percent-completed ' ' Seoul Grand Park , ' ' an entertainment complex three times the size of Disneyland . An art museum recently opened in the park. // Housing is in such demand , Kim says , that a 13 , 000-unit complex built for the visiting athletes was snatched up by private investors , and organizers had to build another . Buildings more than 11 stories high are required by the city to provide public art displays , inside and out , and are to be surrounded by trees and shrubs. // Across town , Sangjin Chyun , a member of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uses that will be made of the Olympic Stadium and other arenas and gymnasiums by the people of Seoul far into the future . ' ' All this is really the result of 30 years ' planning , ' ' he says of the sports complex situated about half an hour from downtown. // In a just-completed state-of-the-art subway ( the world ' s seventh longest ) , tourists , sports fans , and Seoul residents can zip across town quickly . Still under construction are an Equestrian Park , a regatta course , and a yachting center. // ' ' Seoul ' s rising standard of living , developing economy , and accelerating social environment demanded we build all this - even if we never held the Olympics here , ' ' Mr. Chyun says. // But he and others also see another valuable legacy from being host to the coming extravaganzas - at least a temporary change in government attitudes. // The government has dropped some restrictions , such as a mandatory curfew in effect since World War II and certain dress codes for students . The curfew had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4 a. m . Uniforms for students were a way of life. // But even though the service industry is gearing up - with campaigns such as teaching taxi drivers to speak the basics in many languages - there is still an atmosphere of caution. // ' ' I took 17 students on a one-week tour of ( South ) Korea recently , ' ' says Prof. Sugwon Kang , a Korea specialist at Hartwick College in Oneonta , N.Y. ' ' And though I didn ' t tell them - they never noticed - we ' d been shadowed by ( intelligence ) agents every moment from Seoul to Cheju Island and back. ' ' // Indeed , though shopkeepers , drivers , and hoteliers are friendly and courteous , this writer noticed what may have been plainclothes agents on three separate occasions in nine days . One man leaped out to admonish me not to take pictures in the subway when I tried to photograph the subway art . Six or seven appeared in the alley after a I called on opposition leader Kim Dae Jung . Others were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during our visit. // Part of the government ' s concern is over any contact South Korean university students might have with international visitors. // ' ' The reason you read so much about student activism - and that the government is so concerned about stopping it - is that students have played a major part in bringing down the last three regimes , ' ' says H. B. Suh , an official at Hyundai , a giant South Korean conglomerate. // Also disconcerting to the foreign visitor may be the country ' s monthly half-hour civil-defense ritual . On the 15th of each month , sirens sound and agents appear to whisk everyone off the streets and out of hotel lobbies and into basements . For 15 years , the government has repeated the exercise , as an emergency evacuation procedure in anticipation of an attack from the North. // For the most part , though , the Olympics will unveil a Seoul most of the world has never seen - and observers here and overseas see this as a public-relations victory. // //       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
