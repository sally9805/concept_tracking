A directive to close the book on future memoir writers ? <P> Ronald Reagan , who takes pride in his efforts to " get Government off the backs of the people , " has been much less vocal about another campaign he has been waging : to get people off the back of Uncle Sam by vastly expanding the amount of information about the Government that can not be made public . <P> Since the struggle to plug leaks in Washington is certain to be a losing one , there was no great alarm in the capital when the President on March 11 signed a new National Security Decision Directive . It gave various department and agency heads the right to force lie-detector tests on employees suspected of passing classified information to reporters . The announcement was greeted with puzzlement , since many leaks come from these same officials when it suits their purpose . Last week , on closer scrutiny , the order took on a more ominous hue . <P> Instigated by National Security Adviser William Clark at Reagan 's urging , the directive actually extended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officials of the CIA and the National Security Agency . Anyone in any part of the Government who handles " sensitive compartmented information " hereafter will have to submit every speech or manuscript in its entirety to his department head for review . This screening would be required after the employee leaves Government , even throughout his lifetime if his employer so decrees . Said one of the President 's close aides : " When I understood the meaning of it , I just could n't believe it . " <P> While the Justice Department contends that the new procedures apply to only about 1,000 Government officials and employees not previously required to get advance approval of writings and speeches , those now covered include many of the highest officials in the Government , including the White House . Non-Government lawyers who have read the directive find its wording so loose as to be applied , perhaps capriciously , to almost everyone who has some kind of security clearance . This includes thousands of Government workers at all levels . <P> The new directive could , therefore , create a huge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Justice and Energy , which do not now have extensive screening procedures . In the past three years some 800 manuscripts have been subjected to CIA scrutiny . This consumes many hours of reading , then often protracted haggling with the authors over deletions or changes . The process can take a year or more . <P> An Administration official explained last week that the directive was designed to give the Government a simple way to block disclosure without charging offenders with criminal violations of secrecy laws . But critics of the directive regard the restrictions as a potentially dangerous undermining of the ability and willingness of officials to discuss what they learned in Government after they leave it and thus to enlighten public debate on future issues . " This is as close as an American Government has come to implementing an Official Secrets Act , " argues Allan Adler , a counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union .
