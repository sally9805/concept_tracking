Scandal over " sniffer planes " <P> At issue are two electronic devices , code-named Delta and Omega . <P> When mounted in an airplane , they were supposed to be able to detect undersea oil deposits from altitudes as high as 21,000 ft . Elf-Aquitaine , France 's state-owned petroleum company , spent more than $150 million for research and development on the equipment in the 1970s . Yet no oil was ever found . In fact , there is no evidence that ' the expensive devices worked at all . A Belgian count who sold them to Elf has vanished , along with the money . As a result , the leftist government of President Francois Mitterrand is accusing its center-right predecessor of lying and incompetence , an investigation has been launched , and the French public is savoring the oddest political scandal in years . <P> The sniffer-planes affair leaped into public attention last month with an article in the satirical weekly Le Canard Enchaine .

But even before Mitterrand could capitalize on the disclosure , Giscard went on national television to deny any wrongdoing . He implied that others , notably his Premier , Raymond Barre , were more directly involved . Barre , in response , insisted that the affair had to remain shrouded in secrecy " for defense reasons . " <P> The mess evidently began in 1968 , when Aldo Bonassoli , a telephone-company electrician in Ventimiglia , Italy , convinced Count Alain de Villegas , a wealthy private investor , that he could develop a technique for discovering oil from the air . A French intelligence agent learned of the project , and the Giscard government decided that it might be useful for detecting submarines . Villegas signed the first of a number of contracts with Elf-Aquitaine , and payments were made into secret Swiss bank accounts . <P> The deal came unraveled in 1978 , when an independent expert hired by Elf declared that Delta and Omega were useless . Former Premier Barre approved a secret investigation , and a report was issued . Chief Government Accountant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he retired in 1982 ; only Giscard and Barre are known to have kept copies , which they took with them into private life .
