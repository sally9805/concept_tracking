txt  | tal restaurateur would think a Brooks Brothers sack-cut suit drab and formless . And they would both be perfectly correct , for even in these advanced days of laisser-aller , propriety is still something with which to reckon . And just as there are levels of usage in language ? depending upon the purpose , occasion , and audience , as we used to say in English class ? there are proprieties of dress . Clothes talk ; in fact they never shut up , and it makes sense to have them say what you want them to . And . propriety is perhaps more important than ever . It is safe to say that of late , clothing has begun to take a conservative turn , and that clothing in the coming decade will be more " classic " than in the preceding decade , certainly more staid than in the 1960s . One does tend to hear that word " classic " more than a bit ? applied to everything from suits to salads to southern vacations ? but the necessary result of inflation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new models . I think we are , in a sense , returning to pre-World War II days , when buying a suit was a solemn and weighty occasion and not something done every season . Styles will no longer change with the foliage , and men will once again have to pay close attention to the finer points of fit and fabric , tailoring and style . The carefree days of unbridled consumption are fast running out , and purchases will increasingly be treated as investments , and the person who realizes this is very much one up . To consider the initial outlay of money is not enough . It is also necessary to consider the longevity of the garment , the cost of maintenance , long-term style , and adaptability to repair and alteration . The wise dresser is he who appreciates the maxim that it is very expensive to buy cheap . Three good pairs of shoes are better than six cheap ones : they 'll fit more comfortably and last longer ; good shoes look good even when they 're old , but cheap shoes look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suit can now cost in excess of $1,000 , but if it helps you to look well-attired for ten , fifteen , or twenty years , what is the real worth of that suit ? The cardinal rule is : If it does n't fit , do n't buy it ! Even if it 's on sale . Especially if it 's on sale , because then you ca n't return it should you be dissatisfied after the purchase . Fit is the top priority , because while a great variety of colors and fabrics are usually at least acceptable if the fit is good , a person looks terrible in even the poshest cloth if the fit is a poor one . In other words , never sacrifice fit to color or cloth . Never  | buy a cheaply cut garment just because it 's made up in the snappy and fashionable color of the moment . In the past , women have perhaps been the more prone to this fault , but it is now as full-blown a problem for men . Rule two : Never allow yourself to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salt will be most reluctant to drastically alter a garment , not because he 's inherently lazy but because he knows that the line and balance can only be tampered with minutely . A good tailor , as I have said before , and may say again , measures in quarterinches . For your part , you must absolutely insist on service and proper fit , even if it means returning the garment half a dozen times to the shop . In fact , clothing should be broken in a bit ? I think it was Thoreau who pointed out that new clothing belonged to nobody , literally and figuratively ? and the knowing tailor will assume that some adjustments may be necessary after the suit is worn . Rule three : The suit must be made to conform to you , not you to the suit . While you are being fitted before the triplex mirror ? you will want to see all sides of you , so never settle for a single-view mirror ? do n't try to stand ramrod straight unless that is your normal posture . Put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sit down , cross your legs , and fold your arms . Put in the pockets what you normally carry : wallet , eyeglasses , mini-calculator , address book , dog 's leash . If you intend to wear a sweater under the jacket , wear a sweater at the fitting . Appropriate shoes should be worn , too , because heel height has a great deal to do with where the trouser leg " breaks " over the shoe . Do n't go shopping for a suit wearing sneakers , unless for some reason you intend to wear sneakers with the suit . Do n't wear sneakers with the suit . Examine yourself critically in the fitting mirror . The collar of the jacket should hug the neck without pulling , gaping , or riding up , and the lapels should drop straight down the chest when the jacket is buttoned . This area ? the chest and collar ? is crucial because very little here can be effectively corrected if it is not proper at the outset . If the chest and lapels tend to buckle , the jacket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ correct the problem because the chest of a jacket , once it is cut , can not effectively be made larger . You do n't get more doughnut by cutting a larger hole in it . If the suit is from a readymade line , you must either move up to the next larger size , try another  | style , or ( since all manufacturers cut their suits to slightly different proportions and patterns depending on the styling of the garment ) find a brand of suit that is cut with a larger chest . The back of the jacket , on the other side of things , can more easily be adjusted . If there is a tension crease running horizontally across the shoulder-blade area , the back is too small and must be eased ; if there is a " hollow " ? a slack , concave area ? the back is too large and must be tightened . The back of the jacket should sit like a still pond . It must rest lightly over the shoulders , fall without a crease down the upper back , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ break easily over the hips and derriere . The only thing that can be said about the proper jacket length is that the jacket should cover the seat entirely , and even that is more a matter of style and fashion than strict propriety . In the 1920s , men wore " bum freezers , " that is , ventless jackets that extended only halfway down their buttocks ; while in the 1960s , very long hacking-style jackets with deep fourteen-inch vents were the dernier cri ( better left unmentioned the zoot suits of the 1940s , with the onebutton , rolled-lapel jackets that reached almost to the knee ) . These are fashionable extremities . It is often stated ? even by tailors who should know better ? that the bottom edge of the jacket should be long enough to reach the bend in your fingers when your hand is cupped at your side . How this nonsensical concept got started is something of a mystery , since the length of one 's arms plays no role at all in relation to the length of the jacket . What does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the legs , and the rule here is : short legs , short jacket . If your legs are short , ask for a " short " fitted jacket ; if long , ask for a " long " fitted one ; average leg lengths take a " regular " jacket . These length fittings are noted on the jacket size-tag either by the words themselves or by the letters S and L ( a size 38 short fitting will be seen as a 38S ; a 38 long fitting as a 38L ; and a regular 38 simply as 38 ) . Any clothing store that does n't stock long and short fittings in addition to the regular ones is not a good clothing store . Spend your money elsewhere and get a proper fit . Even if you believe you take a regular fitting , it 's a good idea to try on a longer or shorter jacket just for comparison 's sake . You never can tell ; a bit shorter jacket , for example , just might make you look taller , thinner , and younger . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrist ?  | which is where the shirt sleeve would normally fall ? but about a halfinch above , at the middle of the wrist bone when the arm is at rest . This allows for a quarter- to half-inch of shirt cuff to extend beyond the jacket sleeve end . The jacket sleeve itself should not be so tight that it grabs the forearm or upper arm when the arm is bent . A tight sleeve is not only uncomfortable , it wrinkles a great deal more , resulting in the old accordian-arms syndrome . It 's a good idea to wear the jacket around the house a bit before having the sleeve length adjusted , because sleeves tend to ride up slightly , sometimes as much as halfinch , when they are being broken in . At the other end of the sleeve , armholes should be as high as possible without binding . High armholes ( technically called " scyes " by the tailor ) are not only neater in appearance , but they are actually much more comfortable because they allow for freer movement ; a low-cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it when the arm moves , giving the sensation of having half the jacket move forward with the arm . The high armhole allows the sleeve to move more independently of the jacket body itself . The waist of the jacket should sit close to the wearer 's actual waist without producing any horizontal tension lines . A loose or tight jacket waist can be corrected ? but it is a major alteration , to be entrusted only to a competent tailor . If the waist is off by more than an inch , do n't have the alteration done , since the line of the jacket will be ruined . A half-inch alteration at both sides is as much as the balance of the jacket will tolerate . Additionally , button stance ( the number and position of buttons on the front of the jacket ) is of importance when considering the waist . There is always much ado about the number of buttons on a jacket : whether two buttons are better than three ; whether more than one is really necessary anyway ; how many buttons should actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , low , or at the natural waist ; and where , pray tell , is the natural waist anyway ? These are matters more of sensibility than of sense , more in the realm of discretion , fashion , and taste . If you favor a three-button jacket , by all means stick to it . If the salesman tells you that you 'd look better in a two-button one , he is most likely saying that he does n't stock any three-button jackets anyway and that if you insist , he 's going to lose a sale . Let him lose the sale . On the other hand , it is my strong belief that a high or a low button stance can considerably change a physique  | for better or worse . Men with large chests tend to look better in a jacket with a lowered button stance , large-stomached men with a higher one . Today , jackets have three types of backs : single-vented , double-vented ( also called side-vented ) , and ventless . Here again , some of the distinction is merely a matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considerations that should enter into the choice about which style of back to wear . A ventless jacket gives the more elegant , uncluttered line , but you must be slim of hip and slight of derriere to wear this style . Otherwise it looks as though you were poured in and forgot to say " when . " The double-vented jacket is preferable for the man with the fuller derriere because the part of the jacket below the waist ( technically called by tailors the " skirt " of the jacket ) is actually cut fuller ; there is more material there to give a bit of flair to the jacket , a skirting away over the hips in a hacking jacket silhouette . Nothing , when it comes to vents , looks worse ? or , one might add , is more commonly seen ? than a gaping center-vented jacket with the trouser seat and perhaps just an indiscreet soupcon of shirttail on public view . If the vent does n't overlap by a generous three-fourths inch or more , there 's either not enough jacket or too much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shoulder design ( such as natural , rope , concave , full English ) , pockets ( such as besom , patch , ticket , chest , bellows , flapped ) , and other stylistic matters are best left to individual discretion . Now for the trousers . 1The first rule is that trousers should never be tight or short . If there is horizontal creasing across the front of the trousers ? the lap or abdomen area ? they are too tight . A fellow with a bit of a tummy would do wisely to consider wearing pleated trousers , which not only help disguise fullness ( paradoxically ) , but are more comfortable as well . Trousers , by the way , sit over the hips , never below them . If your trousers do not reach your hips , it is because the " rise " ? the distance between the base of the crotch and the waistband ? is too short . You must ask for a trouser with a higher rise . If the salesman tells you there is no such thing , he is either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to ever speak to him again ; he is not interested in your welfare or your appearance , and you owe him nothing . To keep the trousers at their proper height on the waist , waistbands are designed either with belt loops , self-supporting tabs of one kind or another , or  | buttons ( sewn to the inside ) for suspenders ? you can use all three if you are feeling insecure . There is a vogue on at the moment for suspenders ? part of the 1930s nostalgia style ? but the choice depends more on comfort and style than other considerations . My experience has been that they do tend to hold the trousers better , but some men find them more cumbersome than either a belt or tabs . The seat of the trouser may easily be altered to make it either fuller or tighter , and this alteration will also tend to raise or lower the crotch . Only very snug-fitting trousers need provision for what is called " dress . " Dress refers to the side on which a man places the more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to " dress left " or " dress right . " Since ? and again we are dealing here in mysteries ? most men dress left ( but please do n't consider yourself abnormal if you do n't ) , the fork  | of the left trouser leg is conveniently made to account for this phenomenon . Dressing right ? an ironic turn of phrase ? is a problem that can be dealt with , if one wants to deal with it , simply by changing over . The trouser leg should fall straight ? a crease should run down the center of the leg front and back ? and although there have been rages within memory for both exaggeratedly flaired and tapered trousers , the average trouser leg of conservative cut has remained surprisingly stable over the years : about nineteen inches at the knee , seventeen and a half inches at the bottom . Cuffs go in and out of fashion ? at the moment they 're in , but should this book go to a second edition , this is one of the sentences that will have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one to two inches , the average cuff has a depth of one and a half inches , regardless of the length of the legs wearing them . Whether cuffed or plain-bottomed , trouser legs should reach the top of the shoes , preferably breaking slightly over the instep and dropping to within an inch of the top of the heel in back . Because some men tend to be bowlegged , this effect can only be achieved by slanting the trouser bottom slightly downward toward the rear , making the trouser leg a half-inch or so longer in the back than in front . This little tailor 's trick keeps the trousers from flying away behind as though the shoe heels had semaphore flags attached . ? Now for the third part of the suit : the vest . In pre-World War II days it was not unusual to find suits with vests ; it was in fact typical for all single- as well as double-breasted ones , with the sometime exception of summer suits . Today most double-breasteds are vestless , and perhaps only about a third of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell you that the vest is in fact the most difficult part of the suit to make because it sits closest the body ( and as it happens , there are very few good custom vestmakers around today , it being a specialized craft within the tailoring realm ) . Fortunately , there are not as many parts to a vest that must be got right : the front must be long enough to cover completely the trouser waistband , so that no part of the shirt shows , and not so tight that creases form horizontally at the buttonholes ; as opposed to the jacket , vest armholes should be low and certainly not binding ; and the back should be provided with a tab-andbuckle so that a snug fit can be assured through slight variations in weight .  | There is also some confusion about the bottom button on the vest , whether it should be left undone or not . Britain 's Edward VII started the fashion of leaving the button undone ? some say because he grew too fat to button it and English tailors still consider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact construct the vest so that it is not to be buttoned at the bottom . Most ready-made vests , however , are cut so that the button actually works , and so it becomes a matter again of style , with nothing much lost or gained one way or t' other . And oh yes , be sure that the blade end of the necktie does not dangle out below the vest , as this tends to provide an unnecessary point of focus . Now for a few shopping suggestions . Never buy impulsively . When you 're in a hurry , things often look very nice in the shop simply because you did n't take the time to examine them carefully enough , or to worry about fit , or to consider whether the item conforms to the scope of your wardrobe . It 's far better to have something specific in mind when you enter the shop , rather than this deplorable mania for " just going shopping " which leads to the most regrettable examples of impulse buying imaginable . But going out for a specific item @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact , you should , because when there 's no pressure on you from either a sales clerk or necessity , you have an excellent opportunity to educate yourself about items you well may want or need in the future . And if the clerk or tailor is agreeable , ask questions : What 's the difference between flannel and worsted ? When 's the best time to order a seersucker sports jacket ? Are their khakis 100 percent cotton ? What 's the weight of their tropical wool suits ? Buy the absolute best you can afford . Fine clothes will last ten times longer than cheap , shoddy merchandise , will feel and fit better , and of course will look better . A cheap suit looks cheap even when it 's brand new , while a good one retains its appearance after years of wear . A good raincoat , tweed jacket , and flannel slacks actually improve with age and wear . It 's a matter of quality . To help determine the quality , read the fiber-content label affixed to the jacket sleeve and trouser waistband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and will inform you whether the garment is made of 100 percent natural fibers , a blend of natural and synthetic , or all synthetic . Natural fabrics ? wool , cotton , linen , and silk ? in their pure forms , or blended with each other , can not be exceeded for  | appearance and comfort . The reason that synthetics are used more and more in clothing is that they are cheaper to produce . Synthetic-fiber manufacturers spend millions on advertising to convince people that their products are superior . Their pitch is that synthetics are wrinklefree , which is true . But then , so is sheet metal . In the past , synthetic fabrics tended to have a shiny look and a slick hand , they tailored badly , had little porosity , and tended to pill after being worn for a period of time ( those that were blended with natural fabrics ) . While these problems are being seriously addressed by the synthetic-fiber industry , solutions are apparently still in the future . All in all , synthetics are not yet to be recommended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inspect the inside of the jacket and trousers . Better jackets have full linings , which add longevity and help the jacket retain its shape longer . The lining should have a pleat down the center of the back , and there should be a small fold of hem along the bottom edge ; these extra folds allow for expansion when you move , while the lining itself prevents the jacket from bunching up or clinging , enhances movement , and discourages wearand-tear to the outer cloth itself . In the trousers there should be takeout seams of at least one and a half inches in the waist , seat , and legs , to allow for a maximum one-inch expansion should you put on a pound or two over the years ? which does seem to be the way of all flesh . More than an inch and you 'll have to either go on a diet or move up to the next size suit . It need hardly be said that loose threads and buttons indicate shoddy workmanship , but few men take the trouble to look . Tug @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and if it comes away , place it quietly in the salesman 's hand , give him a sympathetic pat on the shoulder , and saunter out the door . When it comes to construction , though , there is a far more serious problem to recognize than a dangling button or two . Better suits are stitched together , and the best ones are done by hand . Cheap ones , funny though it may sound , are literally glued together in a process called " fusing . " Fused suits can easily be detected because they have a decidedly stiff feel , not unlike cardboard , in those areas ( the chest , lapels , pockets , and collar ) where the material is joined . Stiffness is not , however , the major drawback of the fused suit . The real problem is that after some wear , and cleaning , and time  --  often  | less than a year ? the glue begins to dry out and the layers of the fabric start to " bubble , " pulling apart in spots . This deterioration creates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old barn wall . And nothing can be done to prevent , correct , or reverse this process . You are stuck with it , and it will only get worse as time goes by , whether you wear the suit or not . Fused construction is , as you might expect , much cheaper for the manufacturer but much more expensive for the customer in the long run . A $200 fused suit that lasts a year is just twice as expensive as an $800 hand-stitched one that lasts eight years ? even without considering fit or appearance or comfort . Unless you think looking like old paint is great fun , avoid the fused suit . Coordinate . Stick to the colors that you like and are best for you , the ones that complement your wardrobe , and do n't worry about what particularly nifty shades are being touted at the moment . This means that you can avoid buying a complete set of accessories every time you get a new suit . Completely coordinated outfits that can not be broken up and worn with other aspects of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as fashionable as complete suites of furniture . Interestingly enough , when you buy fine clothes the problem of coordination usually takes care of itself , for fine clothes have a marvelous way of complementing each other . If you must buy a shirt and tie to complement your new suit , you are buying the wrong suit : if you 've nothing to wear with it , it perforce has nothing to do with your wardrobe . And if you buy a tie that only can be worn with one shirt or one suit , you 've bought an expensive tie no matter what it cost ! Accessories should do double and triple duty and should therefore be pretty much of a piece , as should the essentials of the wardrobe . For the truth is that while fashion changes , style remains the same , because as Georges-Louis LeClerc pointed out so long ago , " le style est l'homme meme . " Understand yourself and your needs , and fit your clothing to your life-style . And do n't let anyone tell you otherwise . If you wear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there is little reason to buy one ; find a reputable rental shop . Conversely , if you are in black tie once a month or so , you may need two good ones . A white raw-silk suit is wonderfully elegant , but unless you 've got a dozen more serviceable ones in your wardrobe , stay away from it ; a white suit must be cleaned all the time , and if you wear it more than  | four times a year , people will think you live in it . This goes for deafening plaids as well and is of course the reason sensible businessmen who must wear a suit every day usually stick to gray or tan shades , letting a touch of color come from the tie . To add just a brief fillip to the Socratic admonition " Know thyself , " try to dress the . part . Inasmuch as clothing is still the most obvious sign of one 's identity , a man should dress in accordance with his profession and standing in the community . This may sound too Victorian and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ credibility is still based in large measure on consistency . If a man changes his style too often , we feel he is insecure and trying very hard to impress us . Particularly after the blush of youth has passed . A , man should find his style and develop it , should have done his experimenting when young , we feel . A banker who chooses to dress like his sixteen-year-old son , and who turns up at the First National one morning wearing topsiders without socks , fatigue pants , and a neon-enscrawled T-shirt , is not a man to be trusted with your money or mine . And incidentally , his son will not respect him either . Tight jeans and ten yards of gold chain and ceramic clutter on a middle-aged , slightly paunchy , but otherwise solid citizen are embarrassing because they tend to indicate an identity crisis . In this case , psychiatric help is probably a better investment than an extensive new wardrobe . The wardrobe should develop over the years . Do n't throw anything out . This advice always tends to cause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itch to clean out closets and " throw out all those old things you have n't worn in years . " Do n't do it . Stand up for your rights as a dues-paying member of the household and cart the stuff right back to your closet be sure to hang it up properly . Too many women , sad to say in this day and age , are still manipulated by rapidly changing fashion scenarios . But if you bought good clothes to begin with , you will always be in style , something that goes far beyond the frivolities of trendy fashions . The decision to throw things away should be predicated on whether or not they fit , and indeed here your partner may well be the better judge of that than you . The rule is : if it does n't fit , do n't wear it ; but if you keep your figure , keep your clothes . Time is very gentle with quality clothing . The classic navy blazer has been in style for better than half a century and will be for another fifty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Duke of Windsor ? a natty and fastidious dresser if ever there was one ? wore his suits for years and years , including several he had inherited from his father and calculated to have lasted for more than sixty years ! Finally , keeping one 's clothes implies keeping them in good repair . This advice is bound to sound rather trite to a throw-away-oriented person , but since we 've already agreed , have n't we , that we are going to buy quality clothing that is made to last , it makes perfect sense . Suits should be brushed ( with soft bristles ) not only before but after being worn . Otherwise , accumulated dirt and dust will set in the fabric , causing abrasive wear as well as deterioration of color . A good suit should always be hung on a sturdy hanger ? a substantial wooden one , for example , not one of those flimsy wire things ? and dry cleaned by a reliable establishment that knows something not only about cleaning but about pressing a good suit . A dependable dry cleaner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suit . If you do n't know any , ask at the clothing store if they can recommend someone . Or ask your mother ? just because you do n't need her anymore to select your clothes does n't mean she does n't know a lot of things you may not .  | ince the virtual disappearance from the world markets of vicuna ? usually considered to be the finest of all animal fibers ? cashmere is undoubtedly the ultimate luxurious fabric . There is no question that anything cashmere today costs a packet . A custom-made topcoat from a reputable tailor would easily exceed $2,000 , a superior sweater upwards of $400 , and even a pair of socks might cost $75 or $80 . Tidy sums indeed . The fact is , there exists today a classic case of limited supply and high demand for cashmere cloth and garments . The amount of cashmere in the world has always been extremely small . Even with all of our technological expertise , less than four million pounds of cashmere are produced annually , compared with twenty-five billion pounds of synthetic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as enormous . The true source of cashmere is a nimble little mountain goat , who lives in the inaccessible and barren high plateaus of the Himalayas . Because the goat 's habitat is so remote , the most primitive methods still must be used to obtain the fiber ? it is an arduous trip from goat to sweater . Once a year nomadic herdsmen remove the cloud-soft fleece that grows under the goat 's thick outer coat of coarse hair as an insulation  | against the severe climate . The fleece is not sheared away ; it is removed with large handmade combs . Each goat grows only four ounces of usable cashmere fiber a year , which means that the total annual output of three goats is needed to produce enough yarn to knit one sweater . To make a topcoat , it takes the fleece of twenty-seven goats . After the fleece has been combed from the goats and collected together , it is baled and carried by porters ( as well as yaks , horses , and camels when and where available ) down the precipitous mountain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beginning of a journey that will last several months . In Mongolia , from which comes the world 's best raw cashmere , the precious cargo is then transported on rafts and sampans to Kwangchow ( formerly known as Canton ) in the People 's Republic of China . The Kwangchow Export-Import Commodities Fair , the largest cashmere market in the world , is the international marketplace for the purchase of raw cashmere . Western producers must come here if they want the best . The obvious question that must arise when one is confronted with this situation is : why are n't the cashmere goats raised and bred in more accessible places like Florida , Michigan , or Vermont ? And the answer , unfortunately , is that the fine undercoats of the cashmere goats do n't appear to grow in Florida or Michigan or Vermont , or anywhere at all except their native habitat high in the Himalayas . Over the years , many attempts have been made to augment the supply of cashmere by building up herds elsewhere . One of the first recorded attempts was made by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herd of goats to his home , Weald Hall , in 1823 at no little expense . Turned loose on the grounds , they grazed , romped , cavorted , reproduced , and thoroughly enjoyed themselves . All they did n't do was grow that wonderful downy coat . Thoroughly disappointed , the squire made the herd a gift to King George IV , and their descendants can still be seen grazing in the Great Park at Windsor Castle ? and still minus their luxurious undies . Today raw cashmere fiber costs in excess of $100 the kilo in China ; a dozen years ago it was $15 a kilo . Furthermore , import duties on cashmere cloth and finished garments virtually double the price of cashmere in the U.S.A. And then of course there are the costs of production to consider . The raw cashmere must be made into fabric of some sort before it  | can be manufactured into clothing , that is , the cashmere hair must be painstakingly processed before it can be woven or knitted . Much of this processing is handwork done by highly skilled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shades of hair ? which vary in their natural state from almost pure white to dark brown ? to prevent variations in the yarn and thus ensure standardization . The blended cashmere must then be scoured , to remove grease and dirt , and then dried . Next , the coarser hairs , some of which are inevitably combed out with the finer ones of the undercoat , must be separated and removed . This " de-hairing " process , as it is called , was first developed in Bradford , England , by two brothers , Benjamin and Allon Dawson , in the 1890s . In fact , when the Dawson brothers successfully developed a machine capable of de-hairing cashmere , Bradford became the center of the British cashmere operation , and even today Dawson 's is the world 's largest user of high-quality raw cashmere and still produces what the textile trade considers the highest quality woven cashmere cloth . Once the coarse hair has been removed , the fine hair is again combed , then carded , carefully inspected , and packed off to fabric manufacturers who will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ production of cashmere cloth is still very much a craft . The finishing process alone takes three weeks of careful , meticulous work : the cloth must be brushed and steamed and combed several times over to raise the fiber and ensure the luxurious handle and soft glow we associate with the cloth . And this procedure is not something that is written down in a textbook somewhere . You ca n't just take a course in this sort of thing at your local community college . Like all true crafts , it 's a combination of knowledge and skill and a feeling for the work , which is passed down from father to son , from master to apprentice . It is very much a hands-on learning experience and occupation . A fine cloth finisher , for example , may have worked at his craft for over fifty years , and most of them are the sons of finishers . There are many reasons given to explain why the British produce what is generally considered the best cashmere knitwear and cloth . Much has been said over the years about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which courses through romantic , Sir Walter Scott country , and the river 's relationship to the successful cashmere industry in Scotland . The water , according to textile industry experts , does play a  | part : because it has been free from pollutants and hard mineral deposits , it can help soften the hair at various stages of production . But the best reason for the industry 's success there , in the Scottish Border towns of Hawick , Selkirk , and Galashiels , is that they have got the craft ? a system of handworked production that is learned and built up slowly over the years , generation by generation . It is the epitome of , one could say , a way of life that is alien to fast food , instant replays , prioritized printouts , and mini-series . Even the dyeing process is a special skill that has been practiced for generations in Scotland . The cashmere hair ( as with most animal hair that can be dyed ) may be dyed at any one of three stages : before it is made into yarn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is made into cloth , which is called " piecedyeing . " Good knitwear is never piece-dyed , while good cloth may be . The Scottish have developed the art of producing colors as subtle as can be imagined , and as deep and vibrant as can be had ? and without any harshness . Throughout history cashmere has been a luxury cloth , prized for its warmth , light weight , and sensation of softness against the skin . Rich Romans bought cashmere scarves of exotic and intricate design that had been handwoven in Srinagar , Kashmir ( hence the name ) , and brought to Rome by merchant traders . In India the cashmere , spinning industry was so extensive that by the fifteenth century nearly 60,000 people were directly employed in it . By the ninteenth century , the European aristocracy considered cashmere the most fashionable of fabrics . In England , George " Beau " Brummell and the Prince Regent started a vogue for white cashmere waistcoats . And the years from 1780 to 1880 saw such a mania for cashmere shawls for women that these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ European costume . In France , Empress Eugenie , wife of Napoleon III , had an extravagant collection of cashmere shawls . Even Queen Victoria , conservative of dress as she was , was enchanted by the style and owned a ring shawl ? a shawl of cashmere so fine it could pass through a wedding ring . These Victorian shawls were imitations of ones made in the ancient Vale of Kashmir . The original designs incorporated symbolic and natural figures in colorful swirling and abstract patterns , which we now call " paisley " because the work was perfected by the craftsmen of the small industrial town of Paisley , on the west coast of Scotland about  | ten miles from Glasgow . The popularity of cashmere shawls was so great that the fabric was chosen for other woven and knitted garments . In the 1840s and ' 50s paisley designs were copied for ladies ' day dresses of cashmere and for gentlemen 's dressing gowns . The first cashmere sweater was knitted in Scotland about a century ago . Not only were cashmere garments as expensive then as now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clean . Before the recent era of fast-set dyes , cashmere apparel was carefully soaked in tincture of benzoin ( benzoic acid ) and given a sponging of diluted alcohol and ammonia as a restorative . Today maintenance is much simpler . Multicolored sweaters and other knits should be dry cleaned , to avoid the possibility of colors running into each other . Solid colors , on the other hand , may conveniently be hand-washed with a good quality soap powder ( add a drop of bath oil to the rinse to help keep fiber resilient ) with no fear of shrinkage . Lay the garment on a towel ? never twist ? to dry . Since cashmere is made from relatively short fibers , pilling sometimes occurs from friction with objects against the garment . The pills , tiny balls of fiber on the surface , may be removed with the careful use of a safety razor . To prevent pilling from friction with other garments ? sweaters in a drawer , for instance ? wrap the cashmere article in tissue paper for storage . There are really no other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fabrics as well . Tailored cashmere garments , as other tailored garments , should be cleaned and altered only by trusted dry cleaners and tailors . Brushing ? after each wearing ? should be done with a light , quick hand and a fine brush of natural and soft bristles . Badly crushed nap may be brought back to life by carefully holding the cloth over a steaming kettle ? at a safe distance ? and then lightly brushing .  | There are all sorts of reasons to explain why boots became flan important part of a man 's wardrobe this past decade . If you considered the tremendous proliferation of catalogues selling field-and-stream-type gear , you 'd have to come to the conclusion that there are either many more sportsmen around these days or many more who want to give the outward , gentrified appearance of one . And boots are a crucial aspect of those outfits : everything from lightweight trail boots and waterproofed hunting shoes to heavy-duty woodsman 's boots of sturdy silicone-treated cowhide . Your choice rather depends on whether you intend to merely kick around a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serious energy on a marathon hike down the Appalachian Trail . Many of these new sports boots , with their multicolored nylon-and-leather panels , D-ring lace-holes , bumperstyled toepieces , and tank-tread lug soles , are in fact very comfortable and durable ? even if many of them look as though they 'd been designed by someone who had read a great deal about boots and shoes but had never actually seen any . One aspect of this interest is the resurgence in popularity of the cowboy boot . Last in vogue with young people in the 1940s and early 1950s because of the influence of the cowboy movie , this all-American boot of the Old West resurfaced with the popularity of the country-  | and-western recording stars . If singers like Willie Nelson , Hank Williams , Jr. , Waylon Jennings , and the rest did n't actually cause the trend of wearing cowboy boots ( as well as other western paraphernalia ) , they added the celebrity quality to it that had been missing since the demise of the western film as a preferred genre . In the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been the rage , but by the early 1970s cowboy boots , first plain then fancier , began to gain a quorum of interest . For me the handwriting was on the wall one day when I happened to be sauntering down Madison Avenue in the Brooks Brothers-Paul Stuart-Tripler direction . The men 's shops in that vicinity are renowned for their conservative taste and elegant clothing , all pinstripes and broadcloth and foulard . There 's a particular English shoe shop into whose window I always fondly gaze , if for nothing more than to admire the snuff buckskin wing tips , which keep escalating in price just beyond my reach . This particular day , there amidst all those staid and proper cap-toed oxfords , wing-tip bals , burnished plain-toed bluchers , and suede tassel slip-ons stood a pair of dazzling cowboy boots ! I mean , I was knocked absolutely base over apex . Semi-stunned , I gradually noticed that not a few gentlemen in the pinstriped throng also stopped to gaze into the display window , and drifted away , it seemed to me , deep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? this bastion of British conservatism infiltrated by the Wild West ? or were they imagining themselves in these resplendent boots , dancing in some dusty cantina in El Paso and throwing back tequila with abandon ? I may be wrong , but I was sure I heard someone humming " Do n't Fence Me In " as I turned down the avenue . High-topped boots had been worn by cavalry officers in the U.S. Army even before the Civil War , and the Spanish vaqueros who herded longhorn cattle on the plains north of the Rio Grande had also worn boots , adorned with metal spurs . Particularly after the Civil War men from the east and south began to drift westward in search of adventure , or merely a decent livelihood . A few took jobs tending the huge herds of cattle that roamed the open grazing lands of Texas , the activity that in the decades between the end of the war and the turn of the century would provide the most vibrant , heroic image we have ever produced : the American cowboy. that colorful period , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | long cattle drives . Thousands of head of Texas longhorns were driven up the legendary Chisholm Trail from southern Texas to Wichita and Abilene , and virtually all the myths ( and the costume ) of the cowboy derived from this unique enterprise . In truth , the life of a long-drive cowboy was a lonely and arduous one , and his clothes were designed from experience to provide protection if not solace . His wide-brimmed hat and calico bandana insulated him from the scorching sun and choking dust , while tough leather gauntlet gloves and chaps ( the seatless over-trousers ) took the beating of rope and sagebrush . His boots were a special consideration , arguably the most important and expensive facet of the outfit . By 1880 they had already evolved into what we would consider and recognize as today 's cowboy boots : heels were high ? about two inches , to prevent slipping in the stirrups ? and sharply underslung to dig into the ground as a brace for holding roped cattle ; arches were high and tight , and toes were pointed , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fatiguing . The upper part of the boot was cut straight just below the knee and made of tough leather to protect the leg from horse sweat , cactus needles , snakebite , flailing cow hooves , and a dozen other hazards of the range . In fact , about the only modern element missing from those boots was a fancy design . By today 's standards they were rather plain and simple . Exactly when fancy boots came in , and who was first responsible for introducing them , is difficult to say , but as far as I can tell , the general explanation is the same as for many another development of this kind : as necessity diminished , sport and entertainment began . With the advent of the railroad , the long drives became no longer necessary , and the riders of the Chisholm Trail passed into history and folklore and legend . But the decline of the long-drive cowboy marked the emergence of the drugstore variety . Beginning in the 1880s with Buck Taylor , the first " king of the cowboys , " who worked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early western films of William S. Hart , Bronco Billy Anderson , and Tom Mix , the " fancy " cowboy was born . He rode a handsome horse , wore ornate clothes , and later played a fancy guitar . In his world the only unadorned element was his moral code : he hated bad men and injustice and knew what to do when he found them . Toni Mix started the idea of the good guy in the white hat and  | quickly carried it as far as he could by wearing an entire white outfit ? a costume perhaps not conducive to rounding up cattle in open pasture . Not that his boots ever touched open pasture , of course : whether he was fighting desperados or winning the innocent heart of the local schoolmarm , he wore pristine handmade boots of supple leather or exotic skins , with swirls of colorful stitching and inlaid decorations ; occasionally these designs were edged with costly silver studs or gems . While Mix can be credited with popularizing this image of the rhinestone cowboy , he was followed quicker than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white-hatted good guys who could draw their five-string Gibsons as neatly as their pearl-handled Colts . Roy Rogers and Gene Autry ? to mention the two best known ? were perhaps responsible for the most picturesque outfits American heroes have ever worn : crimson shirts with lavender yokes and cuffs ; drainpipe striped trousers with edged pockets and badge-shaped loops ; handtooled belts sporting engraved silver buckles ; fancy silk bandanas , widebrimmed hats with turquoise bands , and of course boots of the most intricate designs ever imagined . By comparison , contemporary celluloid space-invaders look like so many intergalactic shrinking violets . Boots in dove gray and yellow , powder blue and orange , peacock and emerald green , all of the most ingenious design , were not uncommon during this halcyon period of the singing cowboy . Merely to stitch  | a monogram was absolute child 's play compared to the cherry-colored calfskin inlaid with white longhorn-steer heads ; or the sleek black ostrich hide decorated with climbing scarlet roses ; or the famous red , white , and blue " spread eagle " boots worn by Roy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of San Antonio made for display fortyeight pairs of cowboy boots , each pair depicting the particular statehouse , flower , bird , and name of a state . This " state of the Union " series is considered the state of the art even today . In quality and beauty , cowboy boots have rivaled but never surpassed this high-water mark of the late 1940s , and by the 1950s a trend towards other styles of boots had begun , obliging these stalwart and allAmerican beauties to share the spotlight . With the advent of the enormous Harley-Davison motorcycle , and movie idols James Dean and Marlon Brando , motorcycle boots ? with their thick soles , strapped insteps , and bulb toes all in macho-tough black leather ? became the ideal accompaniment to tight jeans and multizippered black leather jackets . These boots were often decorated with shiny metal studs and cleats , and they became the first really " cool " footwear , even though they were originally designed for railroad workers and were known as " engineer boots . " But we all knew they were cool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Without a Cause , when the chief detective snarls to James Dean , " Come on , boy , where 's your boots ? " , characterizing the juvenile delinquent by his footwear . But the motorcycle boot never made it to the next decade , and by the early 1960s there began an outbreak on college campuses across the country of what may conveniently be thought of as Frye fever : a passion for this high-topped prairie style , usually in natural tan leather , with a moderately high heel , thick sole , and small snub toe . In short , an unadorned , basic western boot for the eclectic generation , additionally typified by faded denim , work shirts , and granola . It was a boot that achieved a certain proletarian chic and was gradually accepted by those who could n't go the whole way with cowboy boots . By the 1970s boots had taken on a previously undreamed-of diversity of styles , due in part to our newfound passion for active sports and to some new achievements in technology . Everything from the classic , soft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to high-laced Maine guide hoots , gentleman 's chukkas in luxurious pigskin , and patent leather  | dress jodhpurs abounded . L.L. Bean , the backpacky New England retail firm , won a Coty Fashion Award for its rubber-and-leather " Maine Hunting Shoe " , which , ironically , had been around for over half a century before it was discovered by the fashion world . Another Down East company , Timberland , entered the boot free-for-all , producing several top-quality work boots . Today this explosion continues unabated . New materials are being used in boot construction to provide maximum protection from wet and cold with less weight . Gore-Tex fabric is being used to make lightweight hiking boots , as is abrasionresistant nylon , Vibram , and other space-age materials that are both warm and water resistant . Contrary to the decline in quality of many items we buy , American boots by reputable manufacturers are still made the way they always have been . And unlike many another craft , there are apparently still enough good boot-makers and enough young apprentices around these days to keep business going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the economic way of things , and despite the waxing and waning of styles over the decades , to say nothing of " urban cowboy " fads , Coty awards , and other fifteen-minute trends , there will apparently always be plenty of people around who enjoy wearing boots , whether because they find them to be the most functional working footwear or just fun to wear . Cowboy boots remain the real American footwear , and from the look of things , always will . If you 've decided that a pair of cowboy boots has a place in your wardrobe , there are several points to keep in mind . First , trust the name of the boot-maker . Ready-made boots by the " big five " Texas manufacturers ( listed below ) are built to meet high standards of quality and styling and are sold in a number of good shops around the country . Second , unless exotic skins are desired , the boots should be made entirely of leather , including both outer and inner soles . Third , most hoot salespeople agree that boots should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give a bit in the wearing . Fourth , one must consider  | the variety of styles to be found in toes , heels , and uppers . Boot toes are either pointed , square , or rounded ? everything from the so-called " needle " toes , very pointed and narrow , to the very high and rounded " bulb " - fronted boot . Design here is as much a matter of comfort as fashion . Last year it seemed as though square toes were all the rage among boot-wearers ; this year pointed toes seems to dominate the field . More important , however , is comfort : pick the style that best suits your feet and walking habits . Needle-toed boots were simply not designed for strenuous walking . Heels vary from the simple low and flat " block " style customarily found on town shoes to the classic " stirrup " heel which , because of its two-inch underslung design , can produce a somewhat tottering gait for the wearer and is more at home in the saddle than the city street . The remaining important feature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a V-shaped collar ( the ornamental top of the boot ) are fashionable at the moment , in the drugstore-cowboy style of the 1930s , but if these are not to your liking , you should know that shorter models are manufactured . Normally the size of one 's calf and lower leg determines the width and height of boot required . All of these variations ? and each is important indicate that the best way to find the right boot is to try on several pairs and get the feel of them before buying . For this reason I am reluctant to recommend buying boots by mail order . It 's much better to wait until you 're near a shop that stocks a good variety for your inspection . Once you 've invested in a good pair of boots , you 'll want to take care of them so they 'll look good and feel comfortable no matter what age . Several tips on boot care : 1 . Keep boots polished . This is the single most important step in maintenance of leather footwear . Before wearing new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paste wax . Brush and wipe boots after each wearing , apply wax sparingly , and avoid quick-drying liquid polishes because they contain alcohol which will ultimately dry out the leather . 2 . Alternate wearing boots at least every other day , since they absorb perspiration and need a chance to dry out . Between wearings insert boot trees to help maintain shape , and use a boot jack to aid in remov-  | ing boots . Never store any leather footwear near heat , and air boots overnight before returning them to the closet . 3 . Be vigilant about heel and sole repairs . The longer you wait , the more costly the damage , and worn-down heels throw off the balance of the boot , causing the boots to stretch out of shape and tear at stress points . There are approximately 250,000 sweat glands in a pair of human feet , producing half a pint of moisture a day . For leather footwear to remain supple and in good shape , these three activities ? polish , rotate , repair ? are essential parts of maintenance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ containing silicone and waterproofing ointments like mink oil will do the job . Both tend to darken leather and are not recommended for lighter-colored leathers and suedes ; additionally , silicone tends to clog the pores of leather and will eventually build up a layer if used regularly . THE BIG FIVE BOOT MANUFACTURERS The Justin Boot Company ( Box 548 , Fort Worth , TX 76101 ) has been around for almost a century and got a big boost when Tom Mix began ordering his fancy boots from them . They make a wide variety of styles to satisfy everyone from drugstore cowboy to rodeo rider . Larry Mahan Boots ( 5814 Gateway East , El Paso , TX 79905 ) is a newcomer in the field ; Mahan is not , per se , a bootmaker with a long tradition but rather a rodeo superstar who knows what a good boot should look and feel like . His boots are among the fanciest around and make what in today 's jargon would be called a " fashion statement . " The Lucchese Boot Company ( 1226 E. Houston St. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many to be the elite of the boot industry . Lucchese boots are known for high-quality leathers and elegance of design . While they make as fancy a boot as can be found anywhere , their specialty is the simple and graceful town boot that is favored with western businesswear.  | The Nocona Boot Company ( Box 599 , Nocona , TX 76255 ) is a good traditional boot-making firm that manufactures everything from the classic needle-toed and underslung-heeled tough leather riding boot to fancy-stitched beauties in rainbow hues . Tony Lama ( 1137 Tony Lama , El Paso , TX 79915 ) is probably the largest boot-maker of the five , with the most extensive range of both plain and fancy boots for the whole family . The firm has made quality boots for presidents and film stars , not to mention the complete Dallas Cowboys football team . Footnote  | It 's like a gourmet in a restaurant , " muses Fred Calcagno . " The food 's the important thing , not the ambience . Here it 's the quality of the shirt that counts , not how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they can buy , and that 's what I try to give them . Cary Grant never bothers about how the place looks . " Nor , for that matter , have the likes of Aristotle Onassis , Laurance Rockefeller , designer Jay Specter , Yul Brynner , several dozen other film stars , highly visible politicians , or scores of board chairmen and corporate executives . Whether it 's royal oxford cloth , Scottish-milled Viyella , or finest Japanese silk , Mr. Calcagno ? who is the proprietor and master cutter at Pec &; Company in Manhattan-does indeed give them the best shirts their money can buy . There are just two small rooms in this shop-workroom on the fifth floor of a very typical New York office building . The front room , with its blue walls and gray industrial carpeting , contains one full-length mirror and a long row of shelves against one wall , which hold the stock of cloth . The workroom in back has several tables , a few cabinets , and four sewing machines . All in all , the total area is about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worry , though : you have indeed come to the right place . And  | if you are here for the first time , you may be in for another little shock . Plain cotton broadcloth shirts are at the moment going for about $130 , silk at around $200 ? and Mr. Calcagno will expect you to take a minimum of six shirts for the first order ; yet many consider the price quite reasonable , and not just men who have more money than they sensibly know what to do with , either . It is quite possible to find good off-the-rack shirts . As far as workmanship and cloth go , a Brooks Brothers oxford button-down is a classic , and several other shops around the country sell very nice dress and sports models made here and abroad . There are a few designers who are always concerned for the quality of their products . Further , I know there are several reasons why a man might choose a ready-made shirt or a ready-made anything , for that matter  --  over a custom-made one . Reasons that go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much as custom-made ones . Buying a custom-made garment takes rather a long time compared to just whipping something off the shelf , because the work is painstakingly and precisely done by hand , and because fittings drawn out over several weeks or even months are necessary . Then too , one must ferret out a trustworthy craftsman , since the expense and time involved are so great , and since up to now most custom clothiers have not heavily advertised their services ; they come by their clients by word of mouth , as their fathers before them did . Finally , for some people ? particularly those , psychologists tell us , lacking great confidence ? designer clothing offers cachet to the degree that the garment can become but a foil for the label . The other side of this particular coin is that some men do not trust their own taste in clothes and are embarrassed to even think about selecting fabrics and discussing styling and fit with a shirtmaker or tailor . And these are real objections . It is easier to just pop into a shop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to the office from lunch . Easier yet , if we want to take this line of thought a step farther , to get a wife or mother to do it for us . There are , to my mind , too many men who depend on their wives to do their clothes-shopping ? salesmen tell me the number is considerable ? and it puts me in mind of a line used by a comedienne I heard recently : " I 've just gotten divorced , " she said . " My marriage was childless ? except for my husband . " A man wearing clothes made to his measure tends to look better and  | therefore feel better for it . Custom clothing is almost always better made , and since it fits better as well , the strains of wear are considerably fewer , and so the clothing may be expected to last longer . It is a maxim of those who buy quality goods that these are invariably less expensive in the long run . " I can tell you that John Rockefeller certainly got his money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " chuckles Mr. Calcagno . " Every couple of years he 'd bring in his old shirts to be reconditioned : I put on new collars and cuffs and whatever else had to be , patch a hole or something , and he 'd get another five years out of them . Then back he 'd come again with the shirts for the same treatment . That way he 'd get fifteen or twenty years out of a shirt . I would n't say he was as close with his money as the original John D. Rockefeller , from what I hear , but he sure knew how to put it to best use . " Exactly . Then , too , the quality and workmanship found in custommade clothing are appreciably higher than in factory-made garments . When considerations are made for the handwork involved , the real mother-of-pearl buttons ( unlike the plastic or composite ones , you know , the kind the laundry finds so easy to pulverize ) , the first-quality fabrics , and the detailing , one begins to sense that off-the-shelf shirts ? no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And then there is the most important matter : the matter of fit . Since the shirt is the garment that sits closest the body , the problems of fit can be numerous and delicate : fellows with trim figures often complain of billowing shirt bodies that resemble galleon sails , while broad-shouldered men want more room across the yoke and chest . Sometimes a collar is too high in the nape and too low in the throat , the armhole too loose or the tail too long . Often a man is simply between customary collar sizes and , say , a 15 is too tight and a 15 ? too loose . Factory-production can only accomplish so much , and while some of it is very accommodating indeed , shirts are produced from standard patterns for men with average figures . Problem is , as you well know , few men actually have average figures . And as they do with shoes that do n't quite fit , some men just resign themselves to muddling through . Even if your shoulders are the shape of a bottle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ground when you walk , you are  | perfectly capable of being fitted . Each of these imperfections can be addressed and corrected by a competent shirtmaker . Good shirtmakers , I 've found , combine the more attractive attributes of psychiatrists and sculptors and are geniuses at straightening a curved back , reducing a thickening waist , or lengthening a neck . I do n't want to give the impression that these craftsmen function solely as the court of last resort for unusual physiques , or that they are somehow " orthopedic " shirtmakers . Many of Pec &; Company 's clientele , as with the other great shirtmakers , simply have their own ideas about how they want their shirts to look , fit , and feel and ca n't be satisfied in the shops . Any shirtmaker worth his salt will have several hundred bolts of shirting on the premises all the time and will be able to show you swatches of hundreds more from which to select the perfect pattern and shade ? everything from English Viyella and French voile to Italian gabardine , Swiss broadcloth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exercise in individualism , and each customer tends to his own needs and desires . Some men are interested in nothing but the most proper and conservative white business shirt year in and year out , while others  | are always interested to experiment and do something new and original : a colored collar on a white shirt , a uniquely designed cuff , or perhaps a conservatively cut dress shirt done in an exotic color . " Onassis always ordered exactly the same thing , " Mr. Calcagno informs me , " a white crepe de Chine dress shirt . As long as I can remember that 's all he ever wore . He 'd drop by to say hello , or sometimes just phone , and ask for half a dozen shirts . He never gave any other instructions , and I always knew exactly what he wanted . I never made any other kind or color of shirt for him . " Most customers , however , prefer a wider variety of shirtings and enjoy discussing the finer points of styling and detail with the shirtmaker : collar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rounded club , button-down , short point , wing ) , cuff ( French , convertible , square or rounded edge , with tab ) , chest pocket ( how many , with flap-and-button closure ) , monogram ( inside the collar band , lower left chest , on the pocket ) , placket buttons , squared tails , French seamed front , and any special requirements . These are the types of details the shirtmaker concerns himself with and is pleased to discuss and offer advice . He is the expert , and while his taste may not coincide with yours , it is both a pleasure and an education to talk with him . Once the fabric and styling requirements are settled , the shirtmaker will methodically take about a dozen measurements , exact to within an eighth of an inch , noting the width and curve of the back and chest , waist , and seat , circumference and slope of neck , and length of each arm to the wristbone . From this set of calculations , a paper pattern is struck , registering the necessary configurations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permanent record , which nicely eliminates the necessity for remeasurement each time a new order is placed . " One fellow I make shirts for , " says Mr. Calcagno , " simply hates to shop , so every now and then he just phones up and tells me to send him some shirts like the last ones ? only maybe blue . I ask him if his weight has changed any since the last batch I sent , make the adjustments , and mail them on to him . He 's one of my best customers , and you know , I have n't laid eyes on him for over ten years now . One day I suppose he may stop by , but he 's perfectly happy to have his shirts sent out to him . " The new customer will be asked to return to the shop in two or three  | weeks for the all-important first fitting , by which time a special try-on model will have been constructed from the paper pattern . This model will at that time be adjusted on the customer until both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything it should be . This is the most crucial stage because the adjusted model will be the prototype from which the order of shirts , and all subsequent orders , will be made . That is why the shirtmaker will insist that the first order be for not less than from three to half a dozen shirts ? it is simply a tremendous amount of work the first time around . After that , the number of shirts ordered is not a consideration . Every good shirtmaker has several customers who order dozens a year and many who order one every other year . It would not be unreasonable to suppose that the average customer orders two or three every year or so . The shirts will be ready in about six weeks , a long wait perhaps but well worth it : each shirt has been hand-cut and pieced together , with about thirty single-needle stitches per inch , completely hand-sewn buttonholes , the world 's best fabric , and real pearl buttons . It looks better , feels better , and will last longer . And one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that when the collar and cuffs finally get a bit frayed , one simply sends the shirt back for new ones and general reconditioning and for a nominal cost has virtually a new shirt again ? just like Rockefeller ! There are , finally , two snags in all this that must be mentioned . When I say " custom-made " I mean a shirt cut on a paper pattern that was made solely and exclusively from the customer 's measurements . It is your pattern and no one else 's . There are a number of shirtmaking firms around ? including the so-called " custom shirt " section in various men 's stores and department stores ? that produce what is generally known in the trade as a " semi-custom " shirt : measurements are taken , but an individual pattern is not constructed ; rather a standard pattern is altered to reasonably reflect the customer 's configurations and get reasonably close to a good fit . This method is certainly superior to simply buying a shirt ready-made , but it should not be confused with a true custom-made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If there is any doubt whether the firm you are contemplating doing business with does semi-or full custom-made. , ask if an individual pattern is made for each customer . If it is not , you will not be getting a full custom-made shirt .  | The other snag is that there are shirtmakers and shirtmakers , and it is expensive to buy three shirts here and six shirts there until one hits upon a good craftsman . With that in mind , herewith are listed the premier custom shirtmakers , in scrupulously fair , alphabetic order . Footnote  | There are n't really any rules to this sort of thing that I can see . It 's just a simple matter of good conservative dress . " I was sitting with Douglas Fairbanks , Jr. , talking about double-breasted suits . I reckon if anybody wears a double-breasted suit properly it 's Douglas Fairbanks , Jr. ; whether in films or fur coat ads , he always seems to look just perfect , as he did that day : impeccably cut navy pinstripes , fine broadcloth shirt with English @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black tassled slip-ons , and ? an absolute coup de maitre , I thought an elegant maroon carnation in his buttonhole . I had mentioned that I thought there were all sorts of misconceptions about wearing double-breasted suits ; you know , such as heavyweight men not looking good in them , or the only correct doublebreasted being a dark gray double-breasted , that sort of thing . " No , I do n't think you can make any rules about it , " he reiterated . " I certainly do n't think dark gray is the only shade for a proper suit . I 've got light gray double-breasteds , navy chalk stripes ? and I even like those Princl of Wales checks . The only things that bothers me , really , is to seakunbuttoned jacket . All that flapping about , with the tie and shirt hanging out , I find rather sloppy . I 've heard men say that they unbutton their jackets for comfort , but I 've always felt that if a jacket 's  | made properly it should be just as comfortable buttoned , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am , and knowing full well that Mr. Fairbanks has been on the international best-dressed list so many times he was finally elected a permanent member , who was Ito dispute ? especially since I so entirely agreed ? Did he , I wondered aloud , approve of double-breasted dinner jack-ets ? " Oh , very much . Yes , in different weights for different climates , with either satin or grosgrain lapels , I should think . Very smart . It was the Prince of Wales and his brother , the Duke of Kent , you know , who started that fashion back in the 1920s . Instead of the stuffed-sausage appearance of wing collar , starched shirt front , and heavy waistcoated single-breasted dinner jackets , they wore soft shirts with turndown collars and double-breasted dinner jackets without waistcoats . It was accepted by the younger crowd immediately , and then by everyone else . With good reason too , because it maintained the elegance of formal dress , but was much more comfortable . " Double-breasted jackets , not to mention waistcoats , have in fact been with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we know it developed in England and on the continent in the latter half of the seventeenth century when doublet , breeches , and hose were gradually replaced by coat , vest , and trousers . By the end of the eighteenth century , doublebreasted jackets and vests were already commonplace , as any number of portraits by Raeburn , Reynolds , Gainsborough , and others clearly show . It appears that the jacket always buttoned left flap over right so that the hilt of a sword would not catch on it when drawn . Over the last quarter of that century in particular , gentlemen 's dress was evolving along less formal and more comfortable lines as the landed gentry turned increasingly away from the stiffness , heaviness , and gaudiness of court clothes to the greater simplicity of country dress . The English riding coat became the prototype for correct day wear , the front of the coat cut sharply across at the waist , the square line balanced nicely by a double-breasted fastening , collar , and lapels . By the turn of the nineteenth century , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of English society , Beau Brummell , and given royal imprimatur by the Prince Regent . In slightly  | modified form , it has been with us ever since . The allure of the double-breasted jacket is that it has always had an unaccountable dash and romantic aura about it . It possesses an undeniable jauntiness , which is the reason dandies have always favored it . Victoria 's consort , Prince Albert , gave his interest and his name to a version : a short-waisted , double-breasted frock coat that he was particularly fond of wearing ( although it must be admitted that Albert , clotheshorse that he was , was fond of wearing everything from bright tweed knickers to suits of armor ) . And the Edwardian dandies ? Max Beerbohm , Oscar Wilde , and of course Edward VII himself ? were addicted to their double-breasted velvet smoking jackets , broadcloth morning suits , worsted barathea frock coats , and even boldly checked doublebreasted tweed lounge suits ? often worn with matching tweed spats and golf cap . However , the great age of the double-breasted suit did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likes of the then Prince of Wales , Louis Mountbatten , Fred Astaire , Douglas Fairbanks , Cary Grant , and Jimmy Walker took it as their uniform . Whether in sporty brown glenurquhart plaid , chalk-striped oxford-gray flannel , or the dressier navy worsted , the double-breasted suit with its long-roll , lowbuttoned peak lapels , full shoulder and chest , and bladed back made every man an elegant boulevardier . The English-cut double-breasted " blade " suit , perhaps better than any other masculine garment , defined the years between the wars . Actually , the great success of this style , called in the States a " drape " cut jacket , owed much to one man ? a Dutch tailor named Scholte . He had come to London just after the turn of the century and apprenticed himself to a tailoring firm ? which is still in business today , called Anderson &; Sheppard ? in Savile Row . He rose in the ranks through diligence and skill , eventually becoming managing director and acquiring a glittering clientele along the way . He also became the official @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and one day Scholte 's genius led him to understand why the Guards looked so masculinely elegant in their dress : the large chest of their greatcoats was accentuated by the tight fastening of their belts ! The overriding effect was to give muscles to their appearance . Scholte began to experiment and finally hit upon a way to cut a jacket with a superfluous amount of cloth at the sleeve  | head ( where the sleeve meets the shoulder ) while at the same time indenting the waist , so that the back and chest of the jacket had both the fullness of the Guards coat and a suppressed waistline even without a belt . The result was the silhouette of a wide-shouldered man , muscular and with a trim waist : very flattering and perfectly suited to a double-breasted jacket , because the voluminous cloth in the waist and skirt could be reduced and balanced with a full chest and shoulder . This " English blade suit , " as it is properly called , with its broad shoulders , creep chest , and full blade back ( which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the fullness over the shoulder blades ) , is the perfect medium for double-breasted styling because it accentuates the waist and allows for a longer lapel . A straight-cut double-breasted tends to look boxy , the over-flap merely superfluous rather than a point of style . Unfortunately , as often happens , in the perfection of a style are found the seeds of its own destruction . The superficial charms of the blade suit could be achieved easily enough by exaggeration , and soon virtual caricatures began to appear , in which the effect was produced not by subtle cutting but by simply indenting the waist and using shoulder padding vaguely comparable to that worn by defensive tackles on the Green Bay Packers . This became the all-too-familiar bastardized Hollywood version of a classic , worn particularly by cinematic heroes to further project their he-man images . Coming along during the Depression as it did , the blade suit , according to the February , 1934 edition of Esquire , was " the way to dress if you are so sure of yourself under the New Deal that you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's conception of a capitalist . Since a good appearance is about all that is left to the capitalist anyway , why not go ahead and enjoy it ? " Which is exactly what much of the male population did , capitalist and otherwise , until World War II , when uniforms and fabric quotas took them away from the double-breasted blade suit . The style hung on for a bit through the Truman and Eisenhower administrations , but John Kencrady of conspicuous din a hatless , und single-breasted aned , natural shouldered era , an and narrow lapels ? known alter g , Ib6 natcly as the Ivy League , Brooks Brothers , or Madison Avenue look . Now , I do n't waist to attribute more to this trend than a true scientific spirit ought to allow , and I certainly do n't intend to make any  | socio-political connections here ( as , for example , the media does with short skirts and that sort of thing ) , but I have noticed an increasing number of double-breasteds on the streets and in the shops these past several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which I suppose these days reminds people of nothing more than an old Alan Ladd film or two , but a slimmer-bodied version , more in keeping actually with today 's leaner torsos and athletic life-styles . For example , sauntering along Madison Avenue this past fall , I was absolutely astonished to see a navy worsted double-breasted , of all things , in the window of Brooks Brothers , of all places ? in the very temple of the single-breasted , natural-shoulder look ! Brooks Brothers has not stocked double-breasted suits since the early 1950s . Quite naturally I rushed in to inquire about this earthshaking situation ? these are the kinds of things that make my day . It seems that Brooks was aware that they had been attracting more and more international businessmen , who favor a more shaped silhouette as well as double-breasted styling . Not that Brooks is now bullish on double-breasteds , you understand ; they 've never accounted for more than three or four percent of suit sales , but if that firm sees a market - for double-breasted suits , there must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ double-breasteds is , I ca n't help but feel , because of a renewed interest in formality . Ronald Reagan , even though he wears jeans as Jimmy Carter has , is a more elegant dresser , and whether his administration is the cause or the result of a more conservative , formal tone is irrelevant : it is strong indication and symbol of that tone . Whether it be seen in the increasing number of etiquette books being published or the greater number of tuxedos being sold , there is unquestionably an interest in formality and elegance , propriety and manners ; and this , coupled with a more international outlook , has produced more receptivity to the double-breasted suit . In Europe , particularly in Italy and France , approximately 40 percent of all suits sold are double-breasted . When it comes to wearing a double-breasted suit , there is a myth that I should like to lay to rest , concerning who should and who should n't wear the style . There is the false conception that a short , stocky man or an overweight man should not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Actually , it 's just the opposite , because it is the single-breasted jacket that is always slightly open at the bottom and tends  | to reveal a stomach bulge , whereas the double-breasted one , because cut straight across the front and overlaps , covers and conceals . The overlap of material across the front of the double-breasted jacket does , however , have at least potential disadvantages as well . The outer lapel is so obvious as it extends across the chest , so naturaly the focal point of the jacket , that it must be cut well and perfectly balanced . In a poorly made jacket this lapel tends to be stiff , wrinkled , too high or too low , or ? we shudder ? constructed with a notched rather tban. apeak lapel . On a well-made jacket the lapel should be soft but wrinklefree and button easily without tugging or pulling . A good rule of thumb is that the bottom button should not be placed more than an inch below the top of the jacket side pockets . The amount of overlap depends finally on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ average overlap on a size 40R would ideally be about six inches . The double-breasted jacket should never be worn unbuttoned , since those extra inches of material flapping around are not only unsightly in themselves if allowed to wave around like semaphore flags but will throw off the line of the jacket entirely . This extra material also accounts for double-breasted jackets ' being generally cut a bit shorter than single-breasted ones . Long double-breasted jackets can make a man look as if he 's been rolled up in a bolt of cloth . Jacket vents are usually a matter of personal taste or fashion , but the classic double-breasted suit jacket seems to favor either the ventless back or side vents of a moderate depth ( the vents should reach no higher than the top of the side pockets ) ; a center vent , while appropriate enough on single-breasted jackets , tends to throw off the symmetry here . Symmetry also calls for a buttonhole in each lapel , even though only the left one is ever used for a boutonniere . Finally , double-breasted suits rarely include @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done so since the 1920s . It seems like both a wretched excess of material as well as a surfeit of buttons ( jacket and vest would add up to a dozen buttons strewn across the chest ) . But these fine points have nothing to do with the inhibitory myth than men with certain physiques should not wear double-breasted jackets . The word " inhibitory " does , however , bring to mind one other piece of business that must bear some slight consideration . There are some Freudian theories about tightly buttoned clothing , excessive neatness ,  | and concern for posture perhaps indicating a striving for control and denial of sensuality ? in short , a repressed personality . There are , after all , more buttons on a double-breasted jacket and more fabric with which to encase the body . This much is true . Now , I do n't want the rising tide of enthusiasm for the style to recede just because of an unnecessarily gloomy theory , and as we all know , there is a Freudian explanation for everything , is n't there ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York newspapers ? I have the clipping before me at the moment to refresh my memory ? of a rather bizarre criminal case in the late 1950s . Someone was going around blowing up things and the police were getting nowhere at catching him , and so they called in a psychiatrist to construct a psychological profile of this " mad bomber , " as he was dubbed by the press . After studying letters written by the bomber to the police , the psychiatrist theorized that the criminal was an Eastern European male in his 40s , that he lived with a female relative other than his wife , and that he hated his father but loved his mother . Oh , yes , and when the man was found , the psychiatrist further stated , he would probably be wearing a double-breasted suit ? buttoned ! This all sounds very Sherlock Holmes , but nonetheless , and to move quickly to the denouement of this classic little tale of crime and detection , when the police finally tracked down and captured George Metesky , he was indeed wearing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never pressed the psychiatrist for a complete explanation ( although it apparently had something to do with the man 's being a paranoiac with meticulous personal habits ) , so I can not go into more detail except to mention that just as the doctor had also predicted , the double-breasted jacket was in fact buttoned meticulously .  | The simple fact is that formalism and conservatism are perforce conjoined , so whether the political mood of the country initiates , capitalizes on , or merely follows in the wake of the more formal style that has been emerging for the past several years ? in fashion and home decorating it is referred to as The New Elegance ( with capital letters ) ? is a moot point . What politics and economics do indicate is that there is a more conservative mood about , and this is reflected in the style of daily living . Consider all the etiquette books that have been published this past year or two ? several on the bestseller list and the authors appearing on the Donahue show ? with their emphasis on good , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marriage is once again fashionable and on the increase ( and seen on another Donahue show ) . And not only marriage , but formal weddings as well ! Formal weddings , for those of you who grew up during the benighted 1960s , are ones where the bride wears a long white dress of lace and satin , and the bride groom wears a tuxedo or tailcoat . Even in the art world , Modernism , with Mies van der Rohe 's battle cry that " less is more , " seems to be in fast retreat if we consider the success and showy exuberance of recent museum exhibits that abso-  | lutely revel in the splendor and sentiment of the Grand Style ( the Second Empire , Belle Epoch , and Landseer exhibits were all judged to be triumps by critics and crowds alike ) . Historians and laymen have lately taken a decided interest in the Victorian and Edwardian periods ? everything from scholarly biographies of eminent persons to PBS series ? and many people obviously enjoy a vicarious peek at restrained elegance , taste , and quality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fast and plastic . The Edwardians , it 's often said , knew how to entertain ? even if they did always over-eat and occasionally over-dress . But the really telltale evidence that formalism is asserting itself in daily life is seen in the retail market , all those ads in the papers placed by tuxedo rental firms , whose premises are now bulging with natty cutaways , strollers , and Edwardian evening suits with plush velvet collars . Formal-wear manufacturers are ecstatic , and retailers across the country , it is safe to say , all but salivate when a customer asks for " something in a tuxedo with a kind of Edwardian feeling , " especially when heretofore chaps were tending towards the " personal " wedding ceremony , you know , the one in which the minister intoned a favorite poem and the bride and bridegroom wore matching fatigue jackets . Very dampening for the clothing industry those days were . But for the past several seasons sales have been little short of wild , with some retailers reporting sales increases of 50 percent . Well , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : formality and elegance are again in fashion after that almost twenty-year hiatus of nostalgie de la boue . Whether it 's a special a deux evening at home , a theater party , or a Grand Bal a la Versailles , black and white ties are once again appropriate evening garb . The interesting irony of formal attire is that almost without exception , every aspect of the masculine evening costume derives from the sport of horseback riding . Perhaps I should explain . To begin at the top , the top hat 's high crowned elegance did n't appear until the end of the eighteenth century , designed by the English riding gentry as a kind of crash helmet to be worn while in pursuit of the fox ? as in fact it is still used to this day , an obvious anachronism since there are more safely designed helmets available . Since the same gentry were perfectly accustomed to wearing their country clothes to town ( and even to court , if it came to that , which distinguished them from their various continental cousins ) , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bond Street and other fashionable Regency thoroughfares . Beau Brummell and the rest of the London bucks and dandies established this silky topper as the hat for swaggering sophistication , and soon all the beau monde at White 's Club and Almack 's , at Brighton and Bath , gambling at Crockford 's or dancing at the Chinese Platform in the Cremorne Pleasure Gardens , had accepted it . The top hat had gone in less than half a century from sporting attire to normal street dress and was finally consigned to evening dress . As the century moved on , it was replaced first by the bowler , then the homburg and fedora . By World War I the top hat and its collapsible twin the opera hat ( also called a " gibus " after the Frenchman who invented it to take up less space in cloakrooms ) were relegated to occasions of utmost formality . Utmost formality in this case means an occasion dictating a long coat ( actually the academic gown is considered the most formal attire one can wear , but never mind that ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " tailcoat " is something of a confusion here because both a morning coat and a tailcoat have tails . The morning coat , virtually extinct today , is actually a " swallowtail coat , " that is , its tails are formed by a gentle sweep of the bottom of the coat ( called a skirt ) , curving away from the front and falling behind , in appearance rather like a swallow 's tail-feathers . There is no definite break at the waist . The tailcoat , however , is cut sharply at the waist , straight across the front , so the tails proper only fall from the back of the coat ? the tailcoat does not even button at the front , as a morning coat does . Both coats , however , derive from the same prototype garment : the English riding coat of the eighteenth century . In the preceding century outercoats were generally tapered from chest to waist but swept out full in the skirt . Over the years this volume of cloth below the waist of the coat was gradually reduced , particularly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need for all that cloth draping over the front of the saddle ? and eventually completely cut away , leaving little more than the back of the coat divided by a deep vent into two tails . Even these tails were found to be cumbersome in the saddle and some ingenious tailor contrived a method to solve that : he sewed two buttons to the small of the back of the coat and put buttonholes at the end of the tails : voila ! the tails could be folded up and buttoned to the back of the  | coat when in the saddle . Those two buttons can still be seen on the back of every tailcoat , where as merely vestigial decorations , they serve no real function as they once did . In evening trousers we likewise see the vestigial traces of their historical use in the strip of satin running down the outside leg seam . Originally this decorative stripe was used to cover a row of buttons that were needed with trousers cut tightly enough to stuff into riding boots of molded sleekness . The only aspect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ riding is the penguin coloration , although it is historically a distinguishing mark of the fox-hunting aristocracy . White shirt and necktie have always been the true sartorial sign of a gentleman ? or at least of someone who could be counted on to afford clean linen . The idea of a black suit for both day and evening wear probably developed as a business uniform as the Industrial Revolution and the growth of cities prompted a more homogeneous society ? some say anonymous ? in a Victorian world in which the idea of a gentleman triumphed over the outmoded idea of a courtier . Somberness was , in short , preferred to ostentation by those , it has been remarked , who wanted to appear as grave and serious as the banks and factories they owned . As a young man in the early years of the ninteenth century , the brilliant and elegant Disraeli would saunter about town wearing bottle-green velvet trousers , canary-colored waistcoats , and buckled shoes . But after mid-century he dressed in a black broadcloth suit as befitted the loader of the Conservative Party of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formal costume today is the tuxedo ( called in Britain a dinner jacket and in France a smoking jacket and all three names point to its origins ) . It is the product of the Edwardian country house set and was in its inception a considerably more casual outfit than it is now . The dinner jacket is not , as some have thought , merely a tailcoat with the tails missing ( so you can forget all those stories about Lord So-and-so standing with his back to the fireplace and suddenly being aware of the smell of burning worsted ) . It derives rather from a version of the Victorian " lounging jacket , " a short coat developed about 1870 as a sporting jacket to replace the ordinary day frock coat . The lounge jacket was worn for riding , bicycling , fishing , rowing , and other outdoor events and is for all intents , purposes , and designs the virtually  | identical predecessor to the modern sports jacket . We tend to forget that the sports jacket was originally just that : a jacket worn while engaged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ variety of other outdoor coats ( the parka , field coat , golf blouson , and ranch jacket come to mind ) . As it is the rule in masculine attire that styles emanate from either sporting costume or military garments , first being accepted for day wear and finally evening clothes , by 1880 gentlemen had begun toning up their sports jackets to wear in the evening around their country estates . Daytime jackets were made up in bright tweeds and for the evening opulent shades of cut velvet with satin lapels ; some were padded and had silk braided belts and cuffs . The tailcoat was still considered the only appropriate coat to wear in the evening if ladies were present , but the " dress lounge , " as the dinner jacket first came to be called , was thought to be an informal alternative to wear at one 's club , or as a smoking jacket in the country house billiard room when the fellows passed the port and cigars around . After World War I all these Victorian social distinctions passed away , for better or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough to see a gentleman at dinner in a short coat . In this country the dinner jacket is called a tuxedo , for which the tobacco tycoon Griswold Lorillard is much responsible . On an exceptionally warm and humid evening in October , 1886 , Mr. Lorillard created a spot of bother at the Autumn Ball of the Tuxedo Park Club ? he had in fact been instrumental in making Tuxedo Park a fashionable commuting suburb of New York City ? by daring to enter the ballroom in a short black worsted smoking jacket rather than the prescribed and customary tailcoat . It is recorded that many of the ladies were shocked , most of the gentlemen offended ( or perhaps it was the other way round ) by this blatant breech of propriety , and there was considerable jeering and scoffing . And then not a few of the male habitues , as is often the case with fashion , rushed out to order formal smoking jackets like Lorillard 's from their own tailors . And so the Tuxedo Park Club members put a new word in the dictionary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we appear to be on the threshold of a period rivaled only by the 1930s for distinguished wearables . A better period , in fact , because today there 's more variety and  | much more comfort in formal attire . Elegance used to have absolutely no truck with comfort . Before the thirties a gentleman 's dress kit consisted of an evening suit ( whether a dinner jacket , tails , or both ) of eighteen- to twenty-ounce wool serge or barathea ; an evening shirt of heavy cotton , board-stiff with starch ; a silk top hat or opera hat ; a voluminous dress overcoat ; and the various accessories and jewelry . It was an outfit that today we should find unbearably cumbersome , weighty , and stiff . It boggles the mind , nay the whole body , to understand how any but the stateliest dances could ever have been negotiated . It was a genre crying out for liberation . In the late 1920s and early 1930s the then Prince of Wales ( later the Duke of Windsor ) , among other sartorial luminaries , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wardrobe , liberating men from the stuffed-sausage look of their fathers and grandfathers . Dinner jackets came to replace tails almost entirely ; lighter-weight fabrics ? silks , tropical worsteds , and mohairs ? came to take the place of the heavier cloths ; waistcoats were abandoned ; the top hat ceded to the fedora ; and the stiff shirt with detached wing collar gave way to one with a soft , turned-down collar and unstarched bosom and cuffs . Double-breasted dinner jackets became very popular ( a vest being unnecessary with them ) , and white was de rigueur for resort wear . By the mid-thirties gentlemen 's evening dress had become , in two words , lighter and softer . These standards held for the next thirty years or so , until the generation of the sixties put on its uniform of jeans and battle jacket , when fashionable attire consisted of having political slogans sewn on one 's derriere or having one 's ranch-hand denim jacket lined with ranch mink . It was a great age of prole gear , but except for leisure dress it is now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And there have even been some new variations within the genre , so that today nostalgia , tradition , and the nouveau exist side by side in evening ensembles . And the key to dressing well is to find freedom within the rules . Anyone can be completely different , since it 's easy to be outrageous . The trick is to be just that bit different . When the invitation reads " white tie , " full dress is the rule . Full dress comprises a silk-face ( " facings " are the lapel coverings ) black tailcoat , white pique dress waistcoat and matching bow tie , white pleated  | dress shirt with wing collar and French cuffs , dress trousers ( always black ) , opera hat , white gloves and scarf and dark overcoat ( in cold weather ) , black hose , black patent pumps ( or plain black oxfords ) , pearl cuff links and studs ( or other discreet jewelry ) , and a white or dark red carnation boutonniere . It used to be the rule that a wristwatch was never worn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is still the preferred timepiece with full dress , the rule has been relaxed a bit of late , and a dress wristwatch is considered acceptable today by everyone save a few fanatics who would probably also prefer to arrive at the ball by horse-drawn phaeton . When the invitation reads " black tie , " what is traditionally referred to is a tuxedo , and that 's about as formal as most of us ever get . A tuxedo is usually accompanied by a white dress shirt ( pleated bosom , French cuffs ) with turned-down collar , black bow tie and cummerbund , plain black oxfords , and black hose . It is the classic penguin look that has been standard for over a hundred years , but far from being thoroughly prescribed , black tie dressing affords many tasteful choices . For instance , there are several revived interests in this semiformal area that can be highly recommended . The wing-collar dress shirt is again popular after a hiatus of almost forty years . In the 1930s Wales and his cronies boasted of having dispensed with the wing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highly prized nostalgia ? apart from its downright spruce appearance ? and , combined with a thin , small grosgrain bow , conjures up sophisticated fantasies of Cole Porter evenings at El Morocco . A wing-collar dress shirt is properly made from superfine broadcloth or cotton voile with either small- or fullpleated bosom ( large pleats for larger men ) . The wing collar is worn with a single- or double-breasted dinner jacket ? black for winter , black or white for summer ? but a consonant harmony is achieved with a velvet smoking jacket . This semi-formal alternative to the tuxedo is something the Edwardian gentleman really understood . The smoking jackets of the 1880s were rich velvets of bottle green , crimson , or chestnut . Often quilted ( to keep one warm in drafty country-house billiard rooms ) and frogged , they combined sartorial dignity with comfort . Just as it was then , that sort of true classic must still be hand-built by a tailor . Simpler velvet jackets ? with or without satin lapel f Icings ? can be found ready-made in reputable  | shops . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Keep the rest of the outfit simple and 2. a smoking jacket 's proper place is in the semiformal private party spectrum , not the formal public event . For a full-fig night on the town , an elegant dinner jacket is needed . Anyone who wears a tuxedo more than twice a year is better off having his own : it will fit better , and it 's cheaper in the long run if one has bought wisely . In buying an evening suit the best bet is a single-breasted , conservatively cut version in black tropical-weight wool , with either a silk-faced shawl collar or peaked lapels . This will see a gentleman smartly through every black tie affair , winter or summer , at home or abroad . Its propriety is unimpeachable . Next there is the double-breasted dinner jacket , perhaps the most self-assured of evening jackets . In its youth it was cut from stoutly opulent barathea and had heavy ribbed silk facings . It was worn by the likes of Noel Coward , Cary Grant , and Fred Astaire . Today one would want a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , classically cut white gabardine with white satin facings ( and as with good white flannel , proper white gabardine has a cream cast to it , rather than being dead white ) . For autumn , or for something just that bit different to wear to the annual Christmas bash at the club , there 's the wool tartan or paisley dinner jacket . There are literally hundreds of different tartans , from the festively bright red and yellow of the Macmillan clan to the more somberly elegant dark blue and green hues of the Black Watch pattern . It would be nice to wear a tartan with which there is some personal association , but there 's certainly nothing wrong with selecting a pattern of one 's fancy . It is , however , considered bad form to wear the royal tartans ( the Royal Stewart and the Balmoral patterns ) , as those are reserved for the sole use of the British royal family . Paisley patterns , usually printed on challis ( a soft , lightweight woolen cloth ) , and other small printed motifs ? such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black dinner jacket , particularly in a country setting . As with the smoking jacket , the rest of the outfit should be kept to the unadorned basics : black dress trousers , white dress shirt , black bow tie , and optional cummerbund . The cummerbund is not really an essential part of the dress wardrobe today ; in fact , it seems to have disappeared during the last two decades ( because of the vogue for self-supporting trousers , which also  | explains the demise of suspenders ) . But both suspenders and the cummerbund are once again the latest word , and a good thing too , as both increase the opportunity for variety and individualism and thus give an added dimension to evening wear . The cummerbund helps to tuck in the stomach and provides an alternative to the dress waistcoat . Suspenders are often more comfortable than a self-supporting waistband and are better at keeping the trousers from slipping down . Tradition deems that the cummerbund should be black ? the exception being for summer wear with a white dinner jacket , in which case a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a matching bow tie . It is always worn with the pleats facing up , from a time long since past when there were no pockets in dress trousers and gentlemen tucked their theater tickets in the folds of their cummerbunds . Classic fulldress suspenders are white silk with white kidskin tabs ; black-tie dress customarily calls for black suspenders with black tabs . Some men are sufficiently confident to sport bright red , yellow , or polka dot suspenders with a tuxedo but such unassailable assurance is to snatch a grace beyond the reach of both art and correctness .  | A dress shirt is always white , the bosom is always pleated , the collar is always a simple turned-down straight point or a wing collar , the cuffs are always French . ( There was a short-lived vogue for a few years for button-down collars , and while this is not considered entirely inappropriate , neither is it to be generally recommended ) . Dress shirting is either fine broadcloth or voile , although a smooth , lightweight silk is also acceptable . With a tuxedo one usually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straight one with a wing-collared shirt and a slightly larger one with a turneddown collar . The butterfly bow , larger still and slightly floppy , may be on the return , but this model should be chosen with extreme caution , because a large , floppy bow tends to make a man of slight build resemble a bad parody of a Left Bank bohemian . There is also a vogue of sorts for colored bows ? red , green , even pink and yellow ? and polka dots , which strike a Victorian tone , especially if worn with a wing collar . Regardless of the style , I think an untied bow is preferable to a pre-tied one , only because the pre-tied ones usually look too perfectly tied ; it is , however , better to look too perfect than too sloppy , so if you ca n't manage to tie your own , better get the pre-tied one . Dress at-home evening wear has declined somewhat over the years and is today almost in the lost art category . Too many men who take particular pains to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it comes to at-home entertaining . As formal sit-down dinners are once again fashionable , this becomes something of a timely and special problem . Many an otherwise confident fellow has frustratingly reached , in a last-minute , bone-shaking panic , for his old standby : the navy blazer . Not that there is anything wrong with the blazer approach to dressy at-home attire . With a pair of light-toned flannels or tropicals , and perhaps a discreet ascot , the navy blazer constitutes comfortable and informal party gear . But it certainly is n't the be-all and endall of outfits for home entertaining . There is the smoking jacket , already mentioned , for one . And because it is your home , after all , wear it in as bright a shade as you fancy : cherry or peacock or burnt yellow . A short dressing gown is another good option , in merino wool , cashmere , silk brocade , or velvet , preferably with satin shawl collar and cuffs and tasseled sash . Fancy smoking jackets and dressing gowns are usually worn with black evening trousers or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either a bow tie or ascot . Another alternative that has recently come round again is the shortwaisted dinner jacket , called a " mess jacket " because it was originally worn in the British officers ' mess . It is a remarkably smart-looking jacket , but unfortunately is not for everyone . Resembling a tailcoat cut off at the waist , it requires a svelte silhouette indeed to carry it off properly . If you are trim enough for its waist-emphasizing elegance , the mess jacket is definitely worth considering and looks especially natty done in white duck or linen for summer formality . At the bottom of the evening outfit is the proper shoe . Gentlemen 's footwear has changed relatively little over the past century , and apart from abandoning spats and gaiters , evening footwear has remained the same as it was in , say , 1910 . Some men of course will press into service any dark pair of business shoes found in the closet , which is about as appropriate as wearing any old shoes to play tennis or attend a business conference . Evening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unadorned . Which means that black calf Gucci-type moccasins ( minus the hardware ) and highly polished plain black oxfords are totally appropriate ; wing tips , tan brogues , and cordovan penny loafers are not . Although the elastic-gorged dress boot ( sometimes known as a " romeo " boot ) of the 1920s , the patent-leather monk strap of the 1930s , and the duck-billed dress oxford of the 1940s are now only sparingly with us , the classic formal footwear holds its ground . The Regency pump has endured with considerable panache in both patent leather and faille silk , as has the Victorian slipper , customarily done in black velvet ( but also seen in navy , green , and plum ) . The plaintoed oxford , in either patent or calf leather , will never go out of style ? unlike the patent demi-boot or the polished calf balmoral , the former of which is not popular at the moment , while the latter appears to be . Now to perhaps the most overlooked accessory to formal attire : the boutonniere . While all sorts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the evening tradition prescribes only four flowers : the blue cornflower , the coral or red carnation , and the white gardenia . In Victorian times a double loop of thread sewn onto the underside of the left lapel held a tiny vial of water in which the stem was placed to nourish the flower , and although this practice disappeared before the turn of the century , even today a well-made dinner jacket  | ( or any suit or sports jacket , for that matter ) will have a single loop on the lapel 's underside to hold the stem of the flower in place . Real style dies hard . Full decorations ? medals , orders , and miniatures ? may be worn automatically with white tie at any public event calling for that dress . Decorations are worn on the left lapel of the tailcoat , with the highest ranking decoration placed on the upper right-hand side just below the buttonhole ; other decorations are placed in descending order to the left and may be slightly overlapped . If a second row is needed , it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left , again in descending rank . The exceptions are the Medal of Honor and the Medal of Freedom , which are worn around the neck suspended from a ribbon . With other dress ( other than military uniform , that is ) only the single decoration most suitable and proper to the particular ceremonial occasion is usually worn , rather than full decorations . At a private party , the host should determine and decide whether the nature of the occasion makes it appropriate for decorations to be worn and then issue instructions on the invitation cards . Decorations are never worn to private functions unless the invitation reads " white tie and decorations . " And a boutonniere is never worn with decorations .  | There is the mistaken belief ( particularly in the States ) that the cloth we call " tweed " takes its name from the river Tweed , which rises in southern Scotland and flows a hundred miles northeast to the North Sea , forming a part of the Scottish-English border . In fact , the word tweed , referring to the cloth , owes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a woolens house . For centuries woolen cloth ( and all woolens are called cloth , not fabric ) has been woven in the highlands and islands of Scotland . The natives were wearing woolen garments when Julius Caesar 's legions arrived in Britain in 55 B.C. , and there is written evidence of cloth production there since the fourteenth century . This coarse , heavy cloth that the Scots pronounced and wrote as " tweel " ? what we now pronounce and write as " twill " ? was produced solely for the home market until the early years of the nineteenth century , when London tailors began to advocate its use in sporting attire . They had actually taken the cue from some of their customers , gentry who vacationed in the north to fish and hunt and who noticed that their Scottish field guides kept wonderfully warm in outfits of homespun woolens . And so London tailors and cloth merchants began placing orders with Scottish firms to secure homespun twill for their customers .  | In 1840 some bolts of this " tweel " were involved in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to James Locke , a cloth merchant in London , and the clerk quickly scribbled out the order . In London the illegibly written invoice for " tweel " was misread as " tweed . " And thus is has stood . Scottish cloth first became popular in England after George IV visited the highlands in 1822 . He was the first British monarch to have done so since Charles II ? the memories of Culloden lasted long on both sides of the border . One commemoration of this visit was a handsome painting of the king in full highland dress , done by the Scottish portraitist Sir David Wilkie ; the portrait hangs today in the stately Waterloo Chamber at Windsor Castle . After George 's death England seems to have sunk into masculine sartorial gloom , only to be rescued two decades or so down the road by Queen Victoria 's consort , Prince Albert . Albert had a good figure for clothes , at least early in his life , and took quite an interest in them . Both he and Victoria were also both enamored of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Albert designed a family tartan ? the beautiful gray and russet Balmoral tartan , which unfortunately is reserved for the sole use of the royal family ? and took to wearing tweed trousers with his frock coats for day wear . His eldest son ( Eward VII ) confirmed the royal imprimatur on Scottish cloth by having his shooting suits made up in boldly checked tweed from bolts of the cloth he had received as a gift when he had visited the Outer Hebrides . And his son ( George V ) and grandson ( Edward VIII , later Duke of Windsor ) avidly followed the tweed tradition for country clothing . The landed gentry were quite aware of the sensible yet colorful properties of tweed , and its hardy qualities were well appreciated after a day of shooting or riding about in a damp and cold clime , but tweed was also championed in the nineteenth century by the various members of the so-called Aesthetic Movement , those poets and painters who were in revolt against the stuffy qualities of Victorian art . Both the Decadents ( Oscar Wilde , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Pre-Raphaelites ( Dante Gabriel Rossetti , Edward Burne-Jones , John Ruskin , and William Morris ) attacked the somber and restricting style of dress that had evolved since Victoria had come to the throne . There was an effort to introduce a softer , more natural line and color  | scheme into the fashions of both men and women . Corsets and frockcoats were equally denounced ( Wilde quipped that the thought of a bronze frock-coated statue of oneself added a new horror to death ) as rigid , artless , insipid , and unnatural . The advocates of this movement ( of which George Bernard Shaw became such an early admirer ) were seen to wear soft velvets and homespun tweeds in earthy hues . William Morris always dressed in a voluminous gray tweed cloak , soft felt hat , tweed suit , and handknitted woolen hose . From these seemingly disparate fonts , Pre-Raphaelite poets and pleasure-loving gentry , tweeds filtered down , and by 1914 , that great watershed year , tweeds had in fact become the accepted democratic costume and great social leveler of the age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came a tremendous relaxation of social convention that served to loosen the bond of attire for both sexes even more . The rise of sports and games among all classes , the erosion of the rules of Victorian class consciousness , and a decrease in poverty that allowed more people vacations and the opportunity for travel ? each of these forces had its influence on dress . The tweed jacket and baggy flannels became a uniform for weekends , and some men eventually even . took to wearing the outfit to the office on Fridays , for an early getaway . Tweed was established . The most famous tweed , justifiably so , is Harris tweed . It is called Harris tweed because it is woven on Harris Island . Harris is one ? actually half of one ? of a cluster of islands off the western coast of Scotland . Men have eked out their existence on these barren rocks in the rough North Atlantic , in the Celtic twilight , for centuries , separated from mainland Scotland by some forty miles of turbulent water known as The Minch . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Uist , Benbecula , North Uist , and Lewis-Harris ? which form the group known as the Outer Hebrides , a total land area of 716,000 acres , few roads , and fewer towns . Stornoway , the largest town , has a population of about 5,000 . And even from the steps of Stornoway 's city hall one can gaze up to the surrounding hills and see sheep grazing freely . It is a rugged land , and much of it is barren rock , hard and implacable Archean gneiss to bruise the heel . Altogether it is not a place particularly favorable to man . And since the eighteenth century many of the islanders have looked towards the sea for the basis of their econ-  | omy , first for the fish ? until just recently , when it began to be fished out , The Minch was perhaps the richest herring pond in the world ? and now for the oil . Oil derrick flotels now dot the horizon , and no one here doubts that this newfound wealth will bring changes . Some think the changes will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not glad for drastic changes make Harris tweed . In most townships in the Outer Hebrides more than half of the families own a foot-powered loom for the weaving of tweed cloth . This tweed was first woven in any quantity on the largest island , named " Lewis with Harris , " and by the mid-nineteenth century a well-known industry for the exportation of the cloth had developed on the southern half ( the Harris side ) . Thus the cloth came to be known ? generically , legally , and universally ? as Harris tweed . Let me pause here a moment to present you with a rather interesting equation . The population of the Outer Hebrides is not growing ? is , in fact , decreasing slightly ? and since Harris tweed is a handmade product , there is no appreciable increase in the amount of cloth produced . This year production will probably not exceed eight million yards , which has been the annual yardage for over the past decade . The demand , on the other hand , continues to increase at an escalating pace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economic situation . There has been over the recent years tremendous pressure put on the weavers to join the technological world and produce their cloth with the help of computers , electric-power looms , laser-cutters , and God knows what other " improvements . " But those most involved in Harris tweed ? the mill employers and employees , the weavers , and other members of the Harris Tweed Association ? have their own ideas . In 1976 the Harris Tweed Association ? made up of some 700 weavers , the mill workers and employers , and a ten-man independent board of directors ? met to confront the problem directly . The weavers had been asked by manufacturers to give up their small , foot-powered looms and switch to larger , electric-powered ones that would work faster , weave a wider cloth , and therefore greatly increase production . In this instance the weavers turned their collective back on the twentieth century . They refused to adopt mass production techniques , and by a vote of more than 95 percent they said No . It was a clear-cut case of progress-be-damned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than just yard stuff , that handwoven cloth has a beauty and cachet beyond that . " If we ever put power on the looms , " they say , " we would just be selling cloth . " The Hebridean weaver , it seems to have turned out , is curiously uninspired by the dazzling benefits of modern factory life and production-line existence . He apparently prefers to work in his own home , take his tea break when he wants , go fishing if the weather happens to turn fine for a spell , or visit a neighbor if the spirit moves him . He has no foreman but himself , no time-clock to punch , no prescribed vacation period , no **27;1360;TOOLONG . Production is perhaps less planned here than elsewhere , because the machine ? in this case a Hattersley domestic pedal loom ? keeps pace with the person who operates it , not the other way round . The work is also much more individualistic , as the weaver necessarily puts something of himself into the cloth he weaves . The mill does in fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bolt is shipped with the name of the weaver affixed . And the weavers will tell you that those who predicted gloom when the great " backward " decision was made look damned silly today , because Harris tweed is the more popular for it , and the weaver is making twice what he did then . The making of this cloth is an ancient craft , and the weaving procedure one sees today has changed little over the past two centuries . In early June or July , depending on the weather , the wool is clipped from the hearty black-faced Scottish sheep ( all Harris tweed wool must come from Scottish sheep ) , scoured , baled and marked by a wool merchant , and sent to one of several mills to be made into yarn . These mill buildings , which can stretch for several blocks , resemble small airplane hangars , with their gray poured-concrete walls and high corrugated roofs . One whole room will be stacked perhaps twenty feet high with these 600-pound bales , bursting with the raw , clean , sweetsmelling wool . First @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bale at a time . The dyed wool is then dried in huge spin-dryers , blended with other batches of dyed wool , carded ( the process of opening and separating the fibers ) , and teased and oiled ( made necessary because much of the natural oil was removed in the original scouring , and the oil must be put back into the fiber so it does not become brittle during the  | spinning process ; later , after the yarn has been woven into cloth , this vegetable oil will be removed ) . This processing is done in a mill because it is an arduous , timeconsuming job that technology can do more efficiency , freeing people from the hard task , and in fact taking no beauty from the product at all . The processed wool comes off large rollers in a continuous sheet resembling an infinite gossamer blanket . This wool is then spun by machine onto thousands of bobbins at the same time , and then " warped , " a vitally important process in which the basic pattern of colors is prepared . Warping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ craft in itself . It is the warper 's responsibility to wind the yarn onto a large frame ( six by six feet ) in a specific pattern that will elicit the desired colors and produce even-tensioned thread of a specific length . This warp of yarn ? together with the weft , or background yarn , and instructions for the pattern to be woven ? is then delivered to the weaver , in his own home , where the cloth will actually be woven . I might mention here , since I 've made the point that there have been few procedural changes , that the old method of preparing the yarn for dyeing ( the procedure is called " mordanting " ) by soaking it in tubs of urine is no longer done . Chemical soaks are more expensive and less traditional , but they have been found to do a better job . The various chemical mordants remove the oil from the wool , soften it , and make it more susceptible to the dye , of which there are currently about 5,000 shades . In the trade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wool fibers ( mordant : from the French mordre , to bite ) . The homes of the weavers are not quite the same as the ones we conjure up in our minds , having taken our inspiration from ancient picture ? books . The old prints tend to show romantic white-washed stone-and-thatch cottages , tastefully landscaped all around with climbing roses and heather , and just that gentle curl of peat smoke rising lazily from the chimney . A perfect Galway Bay-by-way-of-Hollywood sort of thing . There are a few of these anachronisms left , but you would have to search to find them , and they are probably all on the Historic Register . Modern housing is generally preferred , and while some modern bungalows do have fireplaces accommodating to peat , many are warmed by gas , electricity , or oil . All with modern kitchens and baths . I.and-  | scaping is optional . Romantic thatch or not , it is here in the weaver 's own home that the true beauty of the craft of tweed-making is seen in its full glory . The yarn is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loudly clacks along the frame , carrying the bobbin back and forth across the strands of yarn . This shuttle moves by footpower : the weaver pushes one pedal down and the shuttle glides across the frame ; a push on the other pedal brings it home . There are eighteen strands of yarn per inch and the pedals must each be pushed once for each strand , each weaver working to his own rhythmn as the shuttle slaps out the beat . It is a wonderful music . The so-called " tweed weave " pattern of intertwining the yarn that the weaver uses is peculiar in that the yarns are crossed over and under each other two at a time , unlike most " plain weave " cloths , in which the yarns are crossed one at a time . This tweed weave pattern ( often called a two-by-two twill pattern as well , since the cloth is technically a twill , and of course etymologically as well ) produces a uniquely balanced cloth , dense yet surprisingly pliable ? properties that are ideal for tailoring because they drape and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the " setting " of the pattern of the cloth on the loom ( since each weaver owns his own loom ) is directly in the hands of the individual weaver . When the yarn is delivered to him by the processing mill he is also given a sample of the pattern ( or pattern instructions ) , but as with any fine craft , there is interpretation , and it is quite true that there are no two lengths of this cloth that are exactly the same . I mention this by way of caution as well as admiration . It is always advisable , if you are having a suit of Harris tweed made , to have a second pair of trousers done if there is enough cloth in the bolt . It 's the only way to get a good match . Over the years any cloth will change color ever so slightly , so it 's a good thing to alternate the trousers , so they 'll both age evenly with the jacket . A finished bolt of cloth ( simply called a tweed ) is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ narrow , only twenty-eight inches across ( unlike machine-woven cloth , which is twice as wide ) and has taken a hundred pounds of raw wool in the making . The weaver can realistically complete no more than three tweeds a week working full-time , and the average is perhaps closer to two . Traditionally , after the weav-  | ing was completed the cloth was baptised and blessed with holy water . Occasionally a song ? not quite as holy ? was sung over the cloth : Roll of cloth , roll of cloth , Bundle of wool , bundle of wool , Tight as a wall , Smooth as the egg , Thick as the bum of the pastor 's wife . Following the same route as he did when he delivered the yarn , the mill driver now collects the tweeds , which are returned to the mill for finishing . In a strict sense , you see , what happens is that the mill acts as producer and sub-contracts the weaving jobs . The weaver , once finished , can simply leave the tweeds in a bundle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its rounds . Back at the mill the cloth is inspected for loose or broken threads and other imperfections by holding it in front of fluorescent lights . Inspected tweed is then washed in a solution of sodium carbonate to remove any dirt and oil that might still remain in the cloth , and then it is " milled . " This process used to be called " waulking , " and an arduous job it was : the bolt was unrolled onto a long , flat table and the women ? as many as a dozen or so ? would pound on it with their fists until it was soft ; Scottish folklore is full of waulking songs . At the mill technology provides a better method : the wet cloth is twisted and beaten in a machine especially designed for this purpose . Milling takes the harshness out of the cloth without damaging it and gives it " handle , " that is , its fine tactile sense of resilience . In the tweed trade this fine soft springiness is characterized as " loft . " A Scotsman 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statement that it 's " a verra lofty bit o ' cloth . " After it 's been milled , the tweed is dried and cropped ( shaved slightly to smooth the surface and get rid of any hairiness remaining in the cloth ) . At this point the cloth is met by a formidable representative of the Harris Tweed Association . Harris tweed , you see , like champagne , has been defined by legal judgment . For years manufacturers all over the world were producing tweed that they called " I larris tweed " but  | that bore little resemblence to the real thing , and the association started to take court action against these counterfeits . As a result of the Scottish court decision in 1964 only tweed that bears the famous Orb Mark of the Harris Tweed Association is entitled to be called Harris tweed . The prime function of the HTA is to protect the integrity and quality of the cloth , so an inspector for the association is always on hand at this stage to satisfy himself that the meticulous standards have been met . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on every three yards of the reverse side of the tweed . This is the assurance that the cloth has complied with the requirements for genuine Harris tweed : 1 . That it should be tweed made from pure virgin Scottish wool . 2 . That it should be handwoven in the homes of the islanders . 3 . That the process of dyeing , spinning , and finishing ( as well , of course , as the weaving itself ) should be done in the Outer Hebrides . If you have n't got that , mate , you have n't got the real McKay . The cloth is an objective correlative for the land and its people : wild and harsh , soft and subtle . The tweed and the weavers have been there for centuries , seen hardships , resisted temptations , clung together , and endured . How long will they both be able to do so , as the contemporary realities of North Sea oil and high technology and quick money come pressuring in , can not be imagined . Perhaps it will unfortunately come about , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ folk and land is shattered ? the yearly rhythm of things , the social graces , peat-fire and music , candle-light and kindness . Now they are gone it seems they never mattered , much , to the world , those proud and violent races . And yet , perhaps not . They are a tenacious lot . Aye , they are !  | In this century there have been several recognized influences on male attire : the English universities , Madison Avenue , the automobile , various sports , and of course warfare come to mind immediately . But seldom has it been noted what a significant effect films have had on male dress . Undoubtedly female costume has garnered most of the attention , both because of its variety and creativity and because male attire was thought to be less " designed , " although Edith Head , Cecil Beaton , Walter Plunkett , and other esteemed film fashion designers produced the costumes for the actors as well as the actresses . Interestingly enough , it is in great measure because of the movies that we come to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to role-playing in all our lives . Just like actors , we dress a certain way to play a certain part in our lives ; and if we stick to those clothes diligently enough they become a uniform , an easy means of identification . And identification by outward appearances ? a means of form defining content is the whole point of costume : an evil person should be seen to be evil , not only by his deeds but by his appearance . The " black hat " approach to life ( as well as westerns ) has a simplistic appeal . That films now have an impact on what men wear is no longer  | denied . For the past several seasons now clothing designers from Yves St. Laurent and Perry Ellis to Ralph Lauren and Giorgio Armani have shown collections for both men and women strongly influenced by films . Armani has acknowledged a debt to 1930s gangster films , and everyone remembers the permeating success of the award-winning Chariots of Fire awhile back , which instigated a rage for tweed Norfolk jackets , Oxford bags , Fair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the 1920s . Chariots of Fire was of course not the first film to present this sartorial theme . The English 1920s and 1930s were first exploited realistically a decade ago in the Ken Russell version of D. H. Lawrence 's Women in Love , and the American period was done even earlier in Bonnie and Clyde ( 1967 , the first film for American designer Theadora Van Runcle ) ? both films achieving more realistic success with costume than previous period films . But the business of movies influencing what men wear is really an o ? d story . To look to the beginning , the Jazz Age of the 1920s that followed World War I created revolutions on many fronts , few perhaps as socially pervasive as a new American hero ? the movie star . Films had become popular literally as soon as they were invented , and the actors almost as quickly became the idols for the generations thereafter brought up more or less on a steady diet of celluloid . Stars came to represent our ideals . They were richer , better looking , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and many were distilled into prototype figures : Leslie Howard as the genteel Englishman ; Charles Boyer as the continental sophisticate ; Gary Cooper the shy American ; Valentino the stormy Latin ; Cagney the slum-reared gangster with a heart ; John Wayne the strong , silent cowboy , an individualist who always went his own way . Each seemed to symbolize a facet of our collective psyche , both a part of ourselves and a way of understanding things apart . Often it became difficult to distinguish between the character and the person , between the role and the actor . The actor became the character , and the costume became the clothes . John Wayne always seemed to have worn the same cowboy getup , the same western jeans , boots , shirt and bandana and hat ; in our mind 's eye Astaire is always in tails , Cary Grant in a double-breasted lounge suit . When they wore something else , as Grant did in The Howards of  | Virginia , we found it difficult to accept them . Grant may have appeared in buckskin breeches , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debonair rather than some backwoodsman clever with an axe . In the 1920s Douglas Fairbanks , Sr. , John Gilbert , and Rudolph Valentino gave us an entirely new silhouette . Previously the ideal shape for men had been more barrel-chested and solidly Victorian , but these " new " men were graceful and slim . Fairbanks 's acrobatic skills in a score of swashbuckling epics helped establish the mood for the lithe masculine body . Men even took to wearing their galoshes unbuckled , in imitation of the pirate boots favored by him . Valentino too , particularly in such films as Blood and Sand and The Eagle , presented an almost feline suppleness . Unfortunately , over the brief years of his reign as Hollywood hero , Valentino 's approach to attire and grooming became a trifle too fancy for American virility . Perhaps difficult to fathom today ? when apparently nine out of ten men have blow dryers ? the slave bracelets and cologne he wore were considered clear signs of depravity , and his star was in decline even before his untimely death . But not before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the patent-leather , sideburned coiffure that was his trademark . Clark Gable , the Hollywood King of the 1930s , made his sartorial mark in a virtual thunderbolt of influence . In the 1933 classic comedy It Happened One Night , with Claudette Colbert , there is a brief fourminute scene in which Gable strips off his jacket , shirt , and tie to reveal . . . a bare torso ! Every man between the ages of sixteen and sixty immediately stopped wearing undershirts . Trade manufacturers of this garment felt the harsh financial pang of neglect and languished forgotten for almost two decades , until undershirts were once again popularized by Marlon Brando in A Streetcar Named Desire and The Wild One . The 1930s also saw the appearance of the urban gangster look , epitomized by Jimmy Cagney in such films as The Public Enemy , Smart Money , Angels with Dirty Faces , and The Roaring Twenties , which set the style for pinstriped suits , snap-brim fedoras , and camel-hair polo coats , not only for other film and real-life gangsters , but for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Cagney 's appeal came from his ability to wear his costume so effectively : there were  | many rumors down through these years that he really had been a gangster ! Nothing could have been further from the truth . It is the 1940s that should be considered the high-water mark of masculine fashion in Hollywood : Humphrey Bogart and Cary Grant , Ronald Coleman and Leslie Howard , Walter Pidgeon , William Powell , and Gary Cooper provided an impeccability and variety unmatched in any period before or since . The way Bogart wore a trench coat ? in Casablanca , Sirocco , and The Barefoot Contessa ? somehow defined the essence of that garment . That most consummate of dressers , Fred Astaire , had paved the way in the previous decade for the polished style of Cary Grant , David Niven , and other Anglo-American types who demonstrated a dominance over formal attire and an unstuffy approach to elegance . The touchstone of these actors was the ease with which they wore even the more restricting of outfits ? the evening suit . In fact , their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and their appearances have a timeless quality of simplicity , taste , and moderation ? amid a whirlpool of excess and flash seen elsewhere at the time . This blend of comfort and correctness became the clarion call of male attire during the difficult war years that preceded the casual revolution that began just afterwards . The 1950s continued with the Anglo-American sophistication ( Grant 's accent was so obviously English , yet as a character he was always saying he was from some place like San Francisco ) , but the new force in film came from the " youth " movies . In The Wild One and Rebel Without a Cause , Brando and James Dean did as much for the T-shirt as Rita Hayworth had done for nightgowns . T-shirts , jeans , boots ( western , engineer , and combat ) , and leather jackets mark the incursion of prole gear into the world of fashion ? an approach to dress that came to dominate the 1960s and reached its cinematic zenith in the quintessential film of the period , Easy Rider . The stylized sophisticated comedies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their claim to our attention by degenerating into pallid little sex romps that seem to have distinguished themselves solely in their ability to continuously portray Doris Day as a beleaguered virgin . Masculine film attire , apart from the prole gear getups of the youth films , was equally pallid ( one thinks of course of The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit , but almost any film starring Rock Hudson , Tab Hunter ,  | or William Holden will do ) ; and into this vacuum rushed the Europeans : Mastroianni , Belmondo , Alain Delon , and a handful of other French and Italian actors captivated our visual consciousness with their suave and streamlined Pierre Cardin suits in such zeitgeist films as La Dolce Vita , L'Avventura , and Breathless . Perhaps nothing propelled the French designers of the 1960s and the Italian designers of the 1970s into the world 's fashion limelight so much as these films ( which by 1980 had already become such nostalgic fonts of inspiration that remakes were beginning to appear ) . As late as 1979 Giorgio Armani , Italy 's premier fashion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line , in which his debt to such works as Breathless ? with the oversized , heavily padded jackets , loose tapered trousers , and blousy shirts is clear . In 1961 the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences awarded an Oscar for costume design to La Dolce Vita , a rather direct tribute to the influence of the Europeans . American actors were still much in evidence during the period , but in the second half of the 1960s there was a conscious attempt to return to the " classic " world of a bygone era for inspiration : the interwar period , particularly the 1920s and 1930s . Bonnie and Clyde ( 1967 ) , Star ( 1968 ) , and They Shoot Horses , Do n't They ? ( 1968 ) were quickly followed by Lady Sings the Blues ( 1972 ) and The Sting ( 1973 ) , and then Chinatown , The Great Gatsby , The Godfather II , and Murder on the Orient Express all in 1974 . Still later Raging Bull , The Postman Always Rings Twice , and several Raymond Chandler remakes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dress of the pre-World War II period . The white flannel suits , pastel striped dress shirts , and wide-brimmed fedoras seen in the shops were all products of these Gatsby-type films , and this interest in ? and perhaps newfound respect for ? the twentieth-century past led to a spate of nostaligc costume films , everything from the Victorian country-house elegance of The French Lieutenant 's Woman to the turn-of-the-century Ragtime from the tweedy Oxford Chariots of Fire to the romantically adventurous parody Raiders of the Lost Ark , which prompted a vogue for slouch-brimmed hats and distressed-leather flight jackets . This recherche pre-World War II Anglo-American collegiate look has continued for the past several seasons now in film as well as on the  | street and designer ateliers , mixed with a pseudo-military-safari type of dressing . I would guess that the tremendous impact of the Australian film industry has had much to do with this . Films such as Breaker Morant and Gallipoli seem to have prompted a rash of khaki bush jackets , duffel bags , cargo trousers , and Gurkha shorts . A contemporary trend of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But whether it be the sophisticated Brideshead look or the macho cowboy hat and tight jeans of Urban Cowboy , it is all well within the tradition of influence that the movies have had on what men wear . Roll over , John Gilbert , and tell Valentino the news . p 133 ITALIAN FASHION The Italian sense of style is hardly to be argued . Whether it 's furniture , sports cars , architecture , kitchen utensils , or clothing , the Italians have made their mark . And it has , interestingly enough , often been said that style is what Italy is all about . Italians nurture it , and cultivate it , wallow in it , and of course export it . It is , to press the point , their stock in trade and it flowers so magnificently in Italy because no other country is so fiercely individualistic . The journalist and social commentator Luigi Bazini , in his book The Italians , notes this concern for the individual as a permeating aspect of Italian life : Transparent deceptions are constantly employed to give a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of being a unique specimen of humanity , a distinct personality deserving special consideration . An Italian considers it a duty to cultivate such illusions in fellow human beings , but , above all , he considers it a duty to himself . Nobody in Italy ever confesses to being " an average man " ; everybody persuades himself he is , sometimes for intricate and improbable reasons , one of the gods ' favorite Sons . This " illusion " can cut a number of ways , but it does show a concern for individual needs in a world drowning in computer printouts ,  | microwave meals , and cassette therapies . Perhaps the Calabrian writer Corrado Alvaro was right when he wrote in his Last Journal that " once Italian humanity is lost , everything is lost . " But this is nothing new . Italy has always had a stylistic edge , and even the most cynical of travelers , Mark Twain , once remarked that the Creator had made Italy from designs by Michelangelo . Today , despite the incredible political and economic turmoil , the artistic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Her film-makers , from DeSica and Fellini to Zefferelli and Wertmuller , chart new courses ; architects such as Pier Luigi Nervi , with his " bravura " style in concrete , have revolutionized contemporary building ; she has surpassed the Scandinavians in modern furniture and rivaled the French in haute couture . And who has produced more beautiful sports cars , printed silks , or contemporary sculpture ? It strikes me that while other nations ? those great scientific and technological empires ? fulfill their missions on the grand scale , policing the continents , measuring the galaxies , and generally deciding the fate of the universe , Italy is content to provide those minute pleasures , those personal and intimate touches , and to cater to those who seek an elegant pair of shoes or an admirable glass of wine rather than the latest and largest IBM computer or the fastest and deadliest ICBM . Not to say that computers and missiles are not important , nor that we should be so narrow as to concern ourselves solely with what touches us directly . But Italy has become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daily , direct pleasures that are in rapid and general decline everywhere else , receding unfortunately from England and all but lost here . This concern for the individual , for the more personal triumphs that craftsmanship bestows , is really part of the larger aesthetic sense . I remember talking with Bruno Piatelli , who is not only one of Italy 's best fashion designers but a costume historian as well , about the Italian 's sense of physical beauty . He made the connection with craftsmanship . " The reason the Italian continues his sense of craftsmanship in the world today is precisely because he understands beauty better . And it is really a product of his culture . In a family , for instance , there is a certain atmosphere unique to that family , and a child growing up in  | that family will necessarily be colored by that atmosphere . That is the way of life . Now during the Middle Ages , because of her extraordinary geographical position and political influence the Italians became the great cloth merchants and traders of Europe . And when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your product very well and get the best value for it , and so the Italians have had a long tradition of knowing cloth , a tradition which is part of our atmosphere . ' " Then too , if one works with his hands ? and much of Italian fashion , from weaving the cloth to finishing the suit , is still handwork ? he lives in a different way , a more individualistic sort of life in which there is room for both more freedom and more imagination than there is for someone who works at a machine . Machinery does not make works of art . For art , we can still learn from the masters of the past . Look to the great painters , not to the machine , if you want beauty . That is the culture of Italy . " And culturally , it has been said with substantial justification , we are all Italy 's children . The list of great minds who have responded to Italy is a chain too long to rattle here . Her influence is the subject of thousands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hobby of Italians everywhere . Historically Italy has been the great bridge , delicately balanced between Northern Europe and the Middle East , sensitive to the pressures of France , Germany , and England , as well as Greece , Turkey , India , and beyond . As early as the thirteenth century one could have seen in that thriving port of Venice cargo ships from every trading nation in the known world . It was this unique geographical position , this strange amalgam of influences , that produced Italy . The Renaissance belongs to Italy . By the end of the thirteenth century , when London was still a walled medieval town of dark , narrow alleys , Venice had already reached its height of prosperity : a city of sumptuous palaces , gold-encrusted churches , spacious sculpture-filled piazzas . Silk , that regal fabric so much in demand in aristocratic households of Northern Europe after the fifteenth century , had been made at Palermo since 1148 . By the beginning of the 1400s Italy had begun to develop industrial production , international trade networks , a modern banking system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wealth of Genoa , Venice , Florence , Milan , and Bologna .  | Italy was built of marble , Northern Europe of brick . By 1500 the Renaissance in Italy had reached its climax . Its influence in the arts and sciences , in commerce , exploration , politics , philosophy , and a host of other endeavors has been so pervasive it is still being studied . One of those endeavors , a lesser pleasure as it were , was fashion . After the fall of the Roman Empire in the West , accomplished piecemeal over decades by those northern harassers and invaders that none of us seems to be able to keep straight ( I remember in my history text the Visigoths were the green arrow ) , Roman dress began to be influenced by the ethnic characteristics of their enemies . It is conjectured , for example , that trousers moved , geographically speaking , from north to south , originating possibly in Britain . The fashions of the Gothic north were , however , not completely accepted in Italy . They were not so conducive to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were not as luxurious as the Byzantine fashions of the East . In short , during the four centuries of her renaissance , there was a melange . Italian fashion in this period of enormous wealth and activity is characterized by intricately decorated , delicate , and sumptuous fabric that only became more heavily ornamented towards the end of the period . The Wedding of Boccaccio Adimari painted at Florence about 1470 , shows a degree of fashion sophistication that makes the dress of Gothic Europe decidedly drab . Looking at other paintings from that watershed century , one feels instinctively that the North represents the past , the old-fashioned , the outdated , and the aged . It is Italy that is the future , the vigorous and new , the young . It is , in a modern analogy , the difference between the 1920s Bright Young Things and their Victorian parents . By the time the Renaissance reached bloom in France under Francis I ( 1515 ? 1547 ) , it was centuries old in Italy , and by the time it came to fruition in England @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) it had passed into the dignity of age in the South . Rich velvets and heavy satins caused bodily movements to slow , to become more formal and stylized , and the wearer took on a stately demeanor no longer young . By this time history had lost its preoccupation with the Mediterranean . First Spain , then Holland , France , and finally England rose to prominence as the great herring pond of the Atlantic promised a highway to the New World .  | At this historic juncture all of the ingredients that make Italian fashion what it is today are already present : a richness of cloth , a concern for dignity , a tradition of beauty . These points translate into an acute concern for appearances , something which other commentators have noticed in the Italian character . Barzini feels that a reliance on symbols and spectacles is a fundamental trait of the national character . Almost as an aside he adds : It is , incidentally , one of the reasons why the Italians have always excelled in all activities in which the appearance is predominant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arts , pageantry , fireworks , ceremonies , opera , and now industrial design , stage jewelry , fashions , and the cinema . Italian medieval armour was the most beautiful in Europe : it was highly decorated , elegantly shaped , well-designed , but too light and thin to be used in combat . The Italians themselves preferred the German armour , which was ugly but practical . It was safer . I am convinced that appearances are so important in Italy because the Italian is a public man . The Englishman says his home is his castle and has to join private clubs to get away from it and into a rather contrived gregariousness . But the Italian lives in the world of the cafe and the piazza . He spends much of his time in public places . " In Italy , " Stendhal noted , " only a total lack of decency could keep one from joining the daily corso . " And even the dour New Englander Nathaniel Hawthorne , who was often critical of things Italian , reacted favorably to this aspect of the national @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he wrote , " anything like this bustle and babble , this thousand-fold talk which you hear around you in the crowd of a public square ; so entirely different it is from the dullness of a crowd in England , where , as a rule , everybody is silent , and hardly a dozen monosyllables will come from the lips of a thousand people . " And Hawthorne was not the sort to wear his heart on his sleeve about people . This concept of the street as salone and be seen , every cafe repast a social occasion . Climate , of course , has made a difference . The Mediterranean has given the Italian sunshine and warmth and vibrant colors , which in turn have given him a strong sense of the  | visual , of the physical environment , of bright colors played against each other . This awareness of color , of the vividness of the physical environment , has also produced a love of the land , an affection for the physical beauties of nature . It is quite true that just as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they deserve . Italian men have a well-trained eye for beauty , for color , for line and detail . They are , as we all should be , fastidious and demanding , and this produces the supreme tailors to meet the challenge as well as very high quality ready-wear clothes . The best bespoke tailoring exists , with one or two exceptions , in England , the United States , and Italy . I hate to be dogmatic about it , but there you are . In England , it is the Savile Row area of London ; in New York , those several blocks in the upper fifties off Fifth Avenue . In Italy , however , there are two equally prominent sartorial encampments , one in the north at Milan , and one in the south at Rome . It would perhaps be a bit tidier , certainly simpler , to have everything in the same place , but when one is dealing with art allowances must be made . And in fact geography does not here account for any stylistic differences . In both places there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is equally high ; similar cloth is used . The north has taken the more influential fashion edge in the past decade or so because the ready-made industry has been there . The clothing factories and the fabric mills are centered around Milan , and the majority of the designers are now there . The firms of Basile , Barba 's , Canali , and Redaelli and the designers Gianni Versace , Enrico Coveri , Gianfranco Ferre , Ermenegildo Zegna , and Nino Cerruti are all there . One name stands apart in its creativity and influence ? Giorgio Armani . Armani has done as much as anyone to put Italian menswear on the map . About a dozen years ago , in the pre-Armani days of fashion , the Italian silhouette was much different from what it is today . It was much leaner , more highly constructed and built up . Jackets were very closefitting , with a shallow chest , very narrow sleeves , a concave shoulder with an e-xtremely high pad , and narrow hips Trousers were usually cut with a slightly lower rise ( the distance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seat , and legs that often flaired slightly below the knee . The suit , as such , had a very stiff , formal , uniformed look ?  | grand , elegant , and just a bit haughty . It was , in a sense , an approach to dress that originated with Pierre Cardin in the early 1960s . Cardin had reacted against the nondescript styles of the 1950s ? bastardizations of the classic natural-shoulder Brooks Brothers look ? by building up the silhouette , while at the same time narrowing it . It was an approach the Italians perfected in the 1970s . And it was to this heightened silhouette that Armani reacted . He was born in the quaint northern Italian town of Piancenza and as a young man hoped to become a simple country doctor . He became disenchanted with studying medicine , however , and after trying several other jobs was hired as an assistant menswear buyer for a large department store chain . Not only he but others quickly discovered he had an intuitive understanding of the subtle relationships among color , of clothes by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and shape . He was asked to help design a a line first collection under his own label . What Pierre Cardin did for the 1960s , Giorgio Armani has done for the past decade . Armani may be said to have revolutionized businessmen 's daytime wear by making elegance more casual and easy . He is responsible for making the sports jacket the center of the wardrobe to the extent that the fashion press has said he re-invented it . Not true , of course , but it does point up the central notion in Armani 's aesthetic philosophy of dress : to soften business wear and give it a comfortable , lived-in look . He is the first to have understood how to move men in the direction of casualness in their wardrobes . To achieve this , Armani took the emphasis away from the business uniform , the suit , and made the sports jacket acceptable daytime wear . He re-cut it and infused it with new colors and textures to make it softer . The classic Armani jacket is less constructed , less built up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It has , in fact , a purposely broken-in aura : shoulders are wide , a la 1940 , but sloped downward ; the collar and lapels are slung low , with the lapel gorge lowered by a full two inches ; sleeves are cut looser ; the chest pocket is several inches lower than one would normally expect , as is the button stance ; and the chest area is slightly oversized , so that it gently creases . All in all , it is a successful attempt to design a jacket that appears broken in even when new , that feels worn and comfortable even at the outset . Both  | jackets and trousers in the Armani collection have this slightly " pulled down " look that clothes normally take on only after years of wear , and it is a part of Armani 's belief that clothes should be old friends , that they are more comfortable to live with that way . This silhouette is part of the vogue for old clothes that has taken hold this past decade , clothes that are soft and faded , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was undoubtedly a reaction to the shoddy and the synthetic on the one hand , and the highly constructed and constricting on the other , the highly pressed and shiny look that swept in on a wave of polyester fabric . Armani was the first to thoroughly understand this reaction in the design field , and who better to under- 0 stand it than the Italians ? This silhouette is bound to change ? as all fashion must ? but that is what has catapulted Armani to the forefront of Italian and world fashion . p 142 There is a rumor ? I 'm starting it now ? that things are getting better . My yardstick is the observation that the mania for designer jeans is now mercifully behind us . There are undoubtedly numerous tides in the affairs of men , and some folks waded into that one until the waters closed over their heads . Not that I mind people spending $50 or even $100 on a pair of jeans ( as they say is done in the Soviet Union , so great is the demand for Americanstyle clothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that so few look good in them . Not to mention what that spray-can fit must do to their circulatory systems . Actually , more than circulatory systems . Some scientists argue that tight clothing can make a man sterile . It 's a matter of heat , they say . Back in the 1960s a group of Swedish scientists opined that very tight trousers could cause , as they put it , " an unnatural heat . . . likely to have a cumulatively serious effect upon the male organs . " The serious effect they were concerned with and about was genetic harm in the form of spontaneous mutation . I 'm not just making this up , you know . Even the American physicist Dr. Edward Teller got in on the subject by suggesting that too-warm clothing could cause genetic damage , and a British Medical Association magazine connected certain cases of ste-  | rility with a fondness for too-hot baths . It 's enough to make a man take up the kilt . Unnecessary , of course , to go to that extreme , since there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ khaki trousers . On college campuses in the 1950s they were often called " chinos " ( because much of the cotton drill cloth came from China ) , and they were sometimes " polished , " that is , given a dull-finished sheen . Occasionally there was a strap-and-buckle in the back . They were neat and respectable and uncomplicated . There was no snobbery or status associated with them . They were standard equipment . Khakis were , in short , clothes that worked . They were tough , resilient , and durable . They had literally come through the war . Khaki trousers became particularly evident in this country in the fall of 1945 , with the college man returning to classes after military service . Cotton drill general-issue trousers were comfortable , inexpensive , adaptable . Most GIs had several pair , and there were always the army-and-navy stores for those in more need of books than fancy clothes . Neutral coloration made khakis ideal mates to brighter tweed jackets and sweaters , and they were easily cared for by young men with more important things on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thrown in the wash and hung up anywhere to dry ? even out a dorm window ? and a few wrinkles only added to their sprezzatura . In truth , khaki had been around long before the college men of the 1940s made it popular . About a hundred years before , and its roots were in utility and war then too . This is one of those places , as it happens , where history is fairly precise . The use of khaki is incorporated with the use of the uniform in modern warfare . Traditionally thought to be a costume calculated to instill respect and awe ? and of course to strike fear in the hearts of the enemy ? the uniform as we think of it is a product of the eighteenth century , when various kinds of troops were first distinguished by their dress as well as their weapons : cavalry , infantry , artillery , navy . Even at this time officers had considerable leeway and privilege to wear pretty much whatever they wanted . And what they wanted was usually very grand . At Waterloo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their own designs , while on the victorious British side it was only Wellington 's personal feelings about what constituted gentlemanly conduct that for-  | bade his officers from carrying their blue and green silk parasols into battle . As late as the Crimean campaign ( 1853 ? 1856 ) , British uniforms were brilliantly erratic : tunics of scarlet , emerald green , and royal blue , slashed with dazzling white cross-belts and studded with gilt buttons . The Guards regiments marched proudly in their bearskin hats , the Hussars and Horse Artillery displayed fur pelisses ( long cloaks thrown over their shoulders ) laced with gold , while others wore white and scarlet plumage , cherry-striped black trousers , and yards and yards of gold braid . It was all very individual , colorful , and grandiose . The British had indeed lost what they considered an inconsequential war to quite improperly and unsportingly dressed backwoods colonists almost a hundred years previously . The straight and unwavering lines of redcoats had made wonderful targets for the ill-clad American troops , but that lesson was late in the learning . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dawn on the British Army that there might be something to be said for concealment . The idea took root in India . In 1846 Sir Harry Lumsden was in command of a native troop of guides at Peshawar . Their sparkling white cotton drill uniforms , Sir Harry noticed with depressing regularity , made them terribly obvious targets for unsporting snipers in the dusty countryside ; not to mention all the time spent to keep the uniforms clean in all that heat and grime . The ironic lesson was that those who actually disobeyed orders by avoiding the regulation spit and polish lived considerably longer than those who played by the rules of gentlemanly confrontation . The lesson was not lost on Sir Harry . Some say the sturdy cotton was originally dyed with tea , others argue for river mud , but the resulting camouflage kept Lumsden 's guides alive longer . The first European troops to follow this lead and adopt khaki ? from the Persian word " khak , " meaning dirt or dust ? were the 74th Foot , who when fighting during the Kaffir War @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tunics with their tartan trousers . From that point on , khaki has had a continuous history of employment in war uniforms . It was worn by the loyal regiments during the Indian Mutiny of 1857 ; in the Afghan Campaign of 1878 ; and the Sudan Wars of 1883-1898 . The British Health Exhibition catalogue for 1884 ? the same year a patented dyestuff produced a colorfast khaki ? stated that khaki cloth had  | officially been adopted by the War Office as the material for troops on active service . There would be no more pomp on the battlefield , only circumstance . American soldiers first wore khaki in 1898 , during the SpanishAmerican War . It became general issue for troops by 1914 , when the Great War rendered brilliance forever obsolete ; when mechanized and impersonal weaponry reduced dazzle and posturing to anachronisms and formal gestures . In the war of 1914 ? 1918 entrenched soldiers saw little use for gold braid and scarlet tunic and fur pelisse . Passchendaele , Neuve Chapelle , Verdun , and the Marne were hell-holes of mud and disease . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the most impersonal , battle ever fought : 1500 guns fired a quartermillion shells , killing 20,000 men on the first day of fighting . And the fighting went on at the Somme for months . There were no uniforms of glory to be seen on either side .  | And when it was over , the Irish poet Winifred Lefts was only one of many who wrote of the sacrifice ( in this case made by the university students ) : God rest you , happy gentlemen , Who laid your good lives down , Who took the khaki and the gun , Instead of cap and gown . God bring you to a fairer place Than even Oxford town . Over the past several seasons khaki has been drafted into the service of fashion . Designers such as Ralph Lauren and Perry Ellis have made considerable use of the fabric in their summer collections , and a designer named Robert Lighton started a company a half-dozen years ago called British Khaki to produce a range of clothing and accessories authentically made of khaki cloth from an Indian mill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maintained the original dyeing process used in the days of the British raj . Lauren also tapped into this " adventurebound gentleman " anachronism when he did a collection of khaki clothes reminiscent of what might have been worn on a Victorian safari in colonial Africa , or the mufti wardrobe of one of Rudyard Kipling 's officers of the Calcutta Light Horse . Authentic detailing went so far as to use button flies on the trousers , which is about as anachronistic as you can get . Additionally , the resurgence of the so-called preppy look and an increased interest in the L. L. Bean type of rugged outdoor gear both in and out of the fashion world have helped to boost the popularity of khaki . All of which speaks to a nostalgic gentrification of the wardrobe . The field-and-stream gear , the ersatz military clothes , and all the other rugged sportswear outfits are a strange blend of fantasy and function , comparable only to the contemporary attempts to recreate colonial country decor in redeveloped inner city historical areas . Just as these rooms are sprinkled with objects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duck decoys , a rusty scythe perhaps ? so these " call of the wild " jackets and trousers are replete with cartridge Footnote  | loops , game pockets , D-rings , epaulets , and holster hooks ? in fact all the necessary survival paraphernalia for a rugged weekend in the wilds of East Hampton . Well , this too shall.pass , but the basic khaki trouser will retain our interest because it does function so well ? which is the mark of the real classic . p 148 LOAFERS i 've often thought that what I would like to do sometime is write an article about all those little touchstones that mark changes in our lives and yet go completely unnoticed , all those unsung but pregnant little moments that signal or symbolize a shift in the old modus operandi . There is one such touchstone in a wonderful scene from the film That Touch of Mink , when Cary Grant ? playing the familiar international corporate head ? saunters into his Madison Avenue wood-paneled office of an average morning . He 's wearing his familiar dark , impeccably cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black straight-tip oxfords . He is the very glass of business fashion and mold of form . It 's important that you get this picture in your mind , because what he does next , coming as it did back in the early 1960s , was an absolute clarion call of liberation comparable in the minds of young executives everywhere to the Boston Tea Party . Grant next removes his suit jacket and town shoes and dons a discreet but obviously very comfortable lightweight cardigan and pair of tassel loafers ! Right there in the office ! I realize that today this all has a rather quaint ring to it , but I mention it as an example of those less-than-earthshaking events that mark the road we have traveled . The point is , of course , that until that time  | this was not the sort of attire a serious-minded man with a correct sense of his own dignity and place in society would want to make his appearance in . Not outside the privacy of his own castle , that is . Casual clothing was still not exactly the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most prevalent , and certainly picayune , criticisms made of the advisers John F. Kennedy brought to Washington with him was that so many of them were in the habit of wearing sports jackets ? which became a symbol of a renegade , intellectual approach they were thought to have taken . Some found it invigorating , others merely brash . Actually , the sports jackets , the cardigans , and the loafers are telling symbols of both outmoded Edwardian standards of propriety and the rising tide of comfort that after World War II finally reached into board rooms and presidential offices . Even the first-class compartments of planes , which twenty years ago would have been uniformly filled with gentlemen in business suits and ladies in traveling suits and dresses , are awash with unisex jogging outfits . Times have changed . At the turn of the last century gentlemen were still wearing heavily padded suits , starched collars , top hats and high-buttoned shoes . How terribly uncomfortable , we would think , and yet our Edwardian ancestors did not really expect comfort from their clothing in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was available . Gentlemen were supposed to be solid , stolid , and serious ? if they were to be taken seriously . It was not thought they should be buddies to their sons , and dressing younger than one 's years was a clear sign of dementia . Even the ladies , if one can use Kipling 's poem " My Rival " as evidence , thought forty-nine the perfect age for womanhood . Dignity was in fact antithetical to comfort ? and it is comfort that differentiates twentiethcentury clothing from its predecessors . Because of paved streets , convenient transportation , climate-controlled buildings , a growing awareness of the value and benefits of hygiene , and various technical developments in the production of clothing , our wardrobes are considerably different from our grandparents ' . Today high-buttoned gaiters and crinolines are a thing of the past , and for footwear the past began to end in the first decade of this century . In fact , almost every form of contemporary footwear for men seen today was established in the first ten years of this century . By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contained practi-  | cally all the shoe models the store now regularly stocks : patent-leather oxfords for formal occasions , black calfskin wing-tip town shoes , white buckskin , and canvas tennis shoes with rubber soles , as well as black and brown toe-cap oxfords , along with a variety of the more old-fashioned laceup gaiter types that had been in style for the previous several decades . To see these newer low-cut shoes side by side in the Brooks catalogue with the then more traditional higher-cut shoes is to realize immediately that back in 1915 the tide was unquestionably turning ? had already turned in reality ? and that men were allowing themselves more comfort in their dress . Heavy suits and boots , stiff collars , and high hats were all on the way out . Lightweight tweeds and flannels , button-down shirts and soft golf caps , shetland sweaters and white bucks , had arrived . The only noticeably absent shoe from that 1915 catalogue is the loafer ( a.k.a. moccasin , slip-on , and casual ) , which is the logical extension of this trend for comfortable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loafer did n't become popular until the 1930s when , as everyone knows , it arrived here from Norway . Oh , you did n't know that ? Well , yes , truth is that the loafer ( even though the word " moccasin , " of Indian origin , is equally used to name this shoe ) is really a model of a Norwegian peasant shoe : a laceless leather shoe of soft construction , in which the vamp ( top front part ) is sewn to the sides in a single piece , and with a strap over the instep . First worn by Norwegian fishermen , who made it for themselves during their off-season winter months , this casual shoe became popular with Englishmen and Americans traveling in Scandinavia after World War I. Loafers became particular favorites of young men , who by the 1940s made them the predominant footwear on campus . Along with khakis and crewnecks , they became part of the de rigueur undergrad outfit and were known first as " weejuns " ( which is of course a corruption of " Norwegian " ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the instep slot caught on , as " penny loafers . " There was virtually not a middle-class young man or woman in the United States who did not own a pair of oxblood-colored penny loafers in the 1950s . At Brooks this type of shoe has always been called a slip-on , but the English custom shoemakers ( firms such as Maxwell , Lobb , Poulson-Skone , and the rest ) are rather traditionalist about it and still refer to it as a  | " Norwegian slipper , " a generic term for a laceless shoe of moccasinstyle construction . Also in the first decade or so of the post-war period there was an increased emphasis on summer and resort clothing ? higher wages allowed more people resort vacations ? and the new slip-on lightweight loafers became an important item in the warm-weather wardrobe , a trend that soon included sandals , rope-soled espadrilles , tennis sneakers , boating mocs , plaited and perforated leather town shoes , white bucks with red rubber soles , spectator-styled black-and-white oxfords , and cloth-and-leather casuals . In some cases , where shantung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ match up the fabric of the shoe with the trouser or jacket . The era of the casual shoe , which so dominates our own day , had arrived . None of these informal innovations , however , came close to challenging the penny loafer as the favorite campus casual . It 's perhaps an obvious point to make that even today when the college grad enters the business world he must to an extent change his wardrobe , retiring the penny loafers , tweed jacket , and khakis in favor of three-piece suit and town shoes . The former uniform he relinquishes reluctantly , inasmuch as it has not only accompanied him through so many formidible and exhilarating experiences but also accords him so much maintenance-free comfort . What is perhaps not quite as obvious , though , is that for the comfort-loving American young man there has always been the attempt to bridge the gap between business- and pleasure-wear , the movement in the direction of comfort constantly encroaching on the business end of the spectrum . In the mid-1950s there was a development of the Gucci slip-on . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deserves its reputation for having revolutionized casual footwear , which is the reason a Gucci slip-on is included in the costume collection of New York 's Metropolitan Museum . The Florentine leather firm of Gucci began as a saddlery in the first decade of this century and quickly achieved a considerable reputation for high-quality craftsmanship , detail , and design . The family-owned firm then turned to luggage , handbags , and other small leather accessories , acquiring more cachet along the way , and inevitably began making high-quality and stylish shoes . The famous Gucci slip-on was actually designed , coincidentally enough , in the late 1930s ? just about  | the time " weejuns " were first being seen on campus . Although the original version was constructed of a heavier saddle leather , the design was what it faithfully remains today : a successful effort to retain the comfort of the moccasin while adding the fashion and elegance of a dressy shoe . In short , it was the shoe that first bridged the gap between casual and business footwear . This dressy slip-on was refined with fine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ metal snaffle bit , and as such it became avenue-elegant and gained acceptance in corporate board rooms and country clubs alike . At the same time that the Gucci shoe gained its first whiff of status , the tassel loafer was being noticed . This casual slip-on was originally the design of the English custom shoemakers , and it was much favored by men who found it a wonderful compromise between the traditional town oxford and the too-casual penny loafer . Also made of expensive leathers and skins , the tassel loafer maintained a small cult following throughout the 1960s , when in the wake of the Gucci success it began to be embraced by more and more men as an alternative to dressier shoes of more traditional styling . Cary Grant 's tasseled soles of discretion were merely a step ahead of general trend . Even the penny loafer has now gone that same exact route , from peasant footwear and campus casual of moderate price to upscaled city shoe . Every good men 's  | shop now stocks expensive penny loafers , hand-lasted and with handsewn vamps in fine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , striped canvas inserts , or even pennies ) . In fact , statistics show that the best-selling dress shoe now is the quality loafer , not the dress oxford , by as much as four to one . While the classic cordovan penny loafers still seem a bit too casual for the board room , a pair of black box calfskin tassel slip-ons is no longer the anathema it once was . There is another advantage to these dressier casuals . A businessman needs a compact wardrobe when traveling , and shoes are notoriously heavy to pack . A lightweight loafer can serve triple duty , worn with a suit , sports jacket , or even jeans if it comes to that . This type of loafer has been known to be pressed into service as beach shoe and bedroom slipper , and it seems to slip on and off easier during those tedious long-distance flights when anything to increase comfort becomes a tender mercy indeed . The history of the loafer , it seems to me , takes issue both with the opinion that decent standards of dress are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a hand-basket and with the theory , on the other hand , that we are entering a new age of formalism . What it does simply indicate is that our material lives are potentially more comfortable than were our grandparents ' , and that proprieties are perhaps a bit more flexible and subtle than our Edwardian ancestors ' .  | I suppose many people do not understand how very much hand-loomed fabric India produces . But the fact is , it is really so extensive and important an area of production to the national economy that the Indian government considers this craft a priority . " So explains Mr. Mohan Shah , whose firm , the Minerva Overseas Corporation , imports much , if not most , of the Indian handwoven cotton and silk fabric sold in this country . It is of course something that we may not realize , perhaps not even think much about ? living in a high-tech society as we do , in which cybernetics , robotics , and micro-chips garner the lion 's share of attention ? that there are societies in which thousands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ craft work . We do , upon reflection , have at least vague inklings that there are probably a thousand or so weavers of tweed in the Scottish islands , and perhaps as many as several hundred cottage weavers shuttling away in New England . But the Indian handwoven fabric industry tends to make the old imagination boggle a bit . Ready ? " The figures for cloth production have been fairly stable over the past several years , " notes Mr. Shah . " India produces about six billion yards of fabric annually , slightly more than half of which is handloomed . I would estimate that there are perhaps five m illion individual  | hand-powered looms in India today for the weaving of cotton alone . It is without question the world 's largest cottage industry , as well as the very backbone of the Indian economy . " It also explains why a spinning wheel is emblematically at the center of the Indian flag . The bulk of this hand-loom production is the cotton fabric we know as " madras . " Traditional Indian madras is 100 percent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ random stripes , or plaids of various patterns . The term madras , according to the Federal Trade Commission , may not be used in labeling or advertising unless it is Indian cloth of this description . Originally the cotton yarn was colored with natural vegetable dyes that were not stable ( chemically stable dyes that stay set in the yarn are said to be " fast " ) , and when the fabric was washed the colors would " bleed " into each other and thus produce new effects after each laundering . The appearance of a madras shirt new was not an exactly reliable indication of what it would look like after two or three launderings . Far from being a liability , however , this effect was highly prized and considered a unique and novel clothing experience , and in fact the beauty of " bleeding madras " was seen to lie in the weathered appearance that accrued from this blending property of the cloth . In the halcyon 1950s , no summer attire branded one more an arriviste than a bright madras shirt and spotless white buckskin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of seasoning ? and so did the man who wore them . Today most madras cloth is fast-dyed , colors no longer run and blend after washing , and bleeding madras is virtually as much a thing of the past as crinolines and perukes . The other properties of great beauty and comfort , though , remain intact . It is one of the best warm-weather clothing fabrics ever devised . This particular cotton fabric is called madras because it is traditionally produced in the southeast part of India , the economic center of which is the port city of Madras ( accent on the second syllable ) . This part of the subcontinent is ideal for growing cotton : there is an average temperature range of 75 ? to 100 ? F. and an average rainfall of about fifty inches or so . The city itself is the fourth largest in India ( after Calcutta , Bombay , and New Delhi ) , with a population of some three and a half million spread over an area of fifty square miles extending back from the Bay of Bengal towards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cloth we call madras is actually woven  | in the city of that name , nor , to extend the semantic irony a bit further , is it even called " madras " there . The cloth is referred to simply as " sixty-forty " cloth , meaning that the lengthwise warp of the fabric comprises sixty threads and the crosswise weft forty ? which has been found to be a perfect combination to produce the desired lightness of weight and still maintain optimum strength of the woven cotton . The weaving itself is done mainly by farmers living in the outlying villages surrounding Madras . Practically every village home has a hand loom for cotton weaving , to provide a supplemental income for farming families during the long crop-growing season when there is little work to be done in the fields . Then every family member will take his or her turn at the loom , and practically everyone from head of household to youngest child is adept at spinning and weaving . The particular type of loom used in this intricate and meticulous labor is known as a " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a five by five by two-foot pit in the ground , unlike other hand looms that are raised on a frame to the height of the weaver 's waist . The design for the pit loom developed because of the scarcity of wood in the area . Instead of building a high and elaborate frame to elevate the loom so that it reaches the weaver , the weaver in essence lowers himself to the loom : he sits on the edge of the pit , with his legs and feet resting on the bottom , no need even for a chair ; it is ingenious and simple , as many ancient crafts are . The history of cotton production in India is an ancient one indeed , and it could be argued that the making of cotton fabric for clothing is one of India 's great gifts to civilization . A dyed fragment of cotton cloth found at Mohenjo-daro ? the southern capital of the Indus culture of antiquity ? confirms the suspicion that cotton cloth had been spun , woven , and dyed in India for at least 4,000 years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inexorably interwoven into the history of India ever since . It is economic life-blood , political symbol , and craft of great skill . Even the introduction of European-managed cotton factories in British India after 1850 had relatively little effect on the destiny of handwoven cotton . What did almost destroy the extensive cotton cottage industry was the mercantile nature of the British import-export laws . During the second half of the nineteenth century Britain came to visualize her  | Indian domain as both a vast source of raw cotton fiber for her burgeoning Lancashire weaving and finishing mills and as a huge consumer outlet for the finished goods of those mills . It was a theory of political economy that had prevailed in England since the reign of Henry VIII and centered on establishing colonies to guarantee a favorable balance of trade ? for the mother country , of course . And so , from shortly after mid-century until the end of World War I , the British government instituted a number of customs acts to make it difficult for India both to keep out British cotton goods and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , put simply , was that British imports , munificent though they might have been for British manufacturing , all but destroyed the rich variety and tradition of the Indian handicrafts and cottage industries . To make matters worse , the British government was little inclined to create new industries for the unemployed peasants who had lost their livelihoods because of these laws . And from this sort of situation ill feelings oft accrue . Specifically , the stage was set for the rise of Mr. Gandhi and an independent India . In both 1904 and 1908 there were successful boycotts of British cotton goods . Indians were urged by their leaders to wear " svadeshi " cloth ( the term for homemade goods ) , and homespun became a potent symbol of national pride and political unity . The svadeshi movement led directly to the revitalization of the dying cottage industries of handspinning and weaving and ultimately to economic and political independence . Although there seems to be little unanimity among his followers and critics as to what his real economic policies might have been had he lived longer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industrialization , and that it was better to improve life in the agricultural villages than to move large numbers of the rural population to the few industrial centers . His brilliant solution was to use handicrafts both as a means of employment and as an instrument of revolution . He particularly entreated his supporters to symbolize their resistance to the Raj by devoting daily time to spinning and weaving ? as he himself did ! With independence in 1947 , the Indian leaders , having achieved their main political objective , were faced with the harsh economic realities of going it alone . The Election Manifesto of the ruling Congress Party therefore concentrated on a planned approach to economic  | development , stating two primary goals : increased agricultural productivity and encouragement of cottage industries ( handicrafts such as art metalwork , ivory carving , ceramics , brass and wood carving , leather footwear and clothing , and most important , hand-loomed cloth ) . Cotton textiles quickly became the rallying point and leading industry , with over five billion yards produced annually after 1956 . More than half of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the most fascinating aspects of hand-loomed fabric is that production methods throughout the world are basically the same , whether it be Scottish tweed or Indian madras . The dyed yarn and basic pattern of the cloth to be woven are provided and distributed by the local cloth mill to the individual weavers , who are as often as not farmers . These farmers then weave the cloth in their homes on looms that they own and then return the woven fabric to the mill for finishing and distribution to clothing manufacturers . The mill pays the weaver for his labor according to the yardage turned in . It is a simple and universal system that allows for individuality and flexibility , particularly at the point where creativity is most important ? the actual weaving of the cloth . It is a system that integrates craft and industry and gets the best of both . The cloth itself is soft and light , but stronger than gauze or other loosely woven cottons , so it is perfectly suited for warm weather . Not  | only is it the least expensive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollars a yard ) , but like any handmade article , each piece has its own individual appearance . Handweaving is an art , not an exact science , and the patterning is still somewhat at the discretion of the artisan who works the loom , and he or she will necessarily impart his or her own feelings into the work and the fabric , which is part of the beauty of the finished garment in which the fabric is used . When it comes to the actual weaving , often the pattern of the cloth is more or less exclusively established by a particular village . Either the weavers themselves in a village will have a particular pattern they are accustomed to weaving by tradition , or the yarn distributor will ask one village to weave a certain pattern or two and ask another village to weave a different pattern . There develops something of a proprietary feeling about these patterns by the villagers , and they become quite skillful and creative about their unique work . This specialization also insures a great variety of patterns and colors for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for example , that developed among the families of the Aran Isles , off the southwest coast of Ireland , where every family has its own pattern for knitting those hefty scoured-wool sweaters worn by the fishermen who ply the cold waters out from Galway Bay . The finished cloth is used for almost every lightweight article of clothing that men and women wear in warm weather , from skirts and trousers to jackets , handkerchiefs , belts , neckties , walk shorts , watchbands , and even athletic supporters . Madras bow ties and cummerbunds , not seen since the mid-1950s , are being resurrected at the moment , and can summer dinner jackets of madras be far behind ? Brooks Brothers introduced madras clothing to this country at the end of the last century , but it was n't until the 1930s that it really became popular . Vacationers to the Caribbean had first spotted the fabric being worn by West Indian natives , and before long shorts and swim trunks , sports jackets and golf trousers were all the rage round the links and club pool . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country that did n't sport a full complement of plaid Bermuda shorts on male and female students alike ? worn either with tennis shoes or with knee-high hose and dress shoes , English style . The denim mania of the sixties and seventies dampened enthusiasm for madras in some quarters , but  | it remains , along with polo shirts and penny loafers , very much a part of the Eastern Establishment summer uniform . The Ivy League shops , whether actually on campus or not , have always been the place to find madras clothes : J. Press , Chipp , Paul Stuart , and Brooks in New York ; the Andover Shop in Cambridge ; Britches in Georgetown ; Langrock in Princeton ; Julian 's in Chapel Hill ; Eddie Jacobs in Baltimore : those sorts of places . And as those stores attest , the campus summer uniform has not changed much in the past thirty years . Plaid madras sports jackets worn with oxford button-downs and khaki trousers are still de rigueur for parties and dances , and madras trousers or walk shorts worn with polo shirts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day wear . The only real difference of course is the price . In the late 1940s you could buy a pair of madras walk shorts for $5 , while today you can expect to pay closer to $50 , but then that 's true of everything , is n't it ? Finally there is the matter of the proper look of madras . The cloth , whether it 's the old " bleeding " variety or the newer color-fast stuff , should not be bright and clear . Rather , just as good tweed , it should have a soft , muted , weathered look . And just as with good tweed , it takes some breaking in to achieve this effect . There are a number of quick ways , it 's often said , to do this : taking showers wearing your clothes , or filling the pockets with small stones and hanging the garment in the rain for a week or two , that sort of thing . I also know that we are living in a world of fast food and speed reading , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some things ? perhaps the best things ? ca n't be rushed , and I think cloth is one of them . The only advice I can give on how to achieve a worn effect is to wear the garment ; wear it around the house when you are alone if you must , and launder it frequently . Eventually it will break in and settle down , and you can take it out in company .  | MAIL ORDER CLOTHES The postman and the public can certainly attest to the fact that catalogue fever is sweeping the country . A flip through the latest L. L. Bean , Orvis , or Paul Stuart catalogue conjures up wish lists to indulge the wildest fantasy . Items not usually stocked in the local haberdashery , such as authentic Irish fisherman sweaters and World War II bomber jackets , fine Sea Island cotton underwear , sturdy English country walking shoes , goose-down vests , and pith helmets abound , as do millions of imaginative accessories to please the mountain man , the Marlboro man , or the businessman . Sitting in homey comfort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and sealing an envelope has become for many men the preferred way to shop . Farmers initially pondered over the wonders of Montgomery Ward and Sears Roebuck as they shopped by mail for tools and the latest in farm gadgetry . Today , catalogues offer quality , good value , and fashion ? usually at a good price . Prices , in fact , are generally competitive , but shopping across state lines by mail saves you the sales tax , which on a nylon wristwatch band may not amount to much , but on a Burberry raincoat and a couple of suits can save you a bundle . Catalogues perform an incredible service for the person who is either  | too busy to shop or who dislikes shopping . Parking and package-lugging are avoided , and the goods are " edited " for you . Some catalogues specialize , for example , in active sportswear ( some even specialize in sportswear for a particular sport ) , or in a certain style of clothing , or even in a particular price range ( one catalogue has handsome cotton sweaters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The cascade of catalogues arriving daily presses some people into becoming collectors ? original old catalogues command high prices at ephemera shows , and even facsimile editions have become popular reading ? and the fine print can be full of insightful instructions and folklore . For instance , did you know that the U.S. Army has determined that for a material to be waterproof it must have a water entry pressure of twenty-five pounds per square inch ( Orvis ) ; or that the word " chaps " is short for " chaparreras , " Spanish for leg armor ( Kauffman ) ; or that Captain Cook thought the Seychelles the original Garden of Eden ( Banana Republic ) ? This is knowledge not systematized enough perhaps to gain you a Chair of Humanities at Cambridge , but damned fascinating nonetheless . Many men 's shops send out flyers , brochures , and catalogues of one type and other , and some have extensive mailing lists ? on which you may request to be included . Paul Stuart in New York does a superb catalogue , as does Louis of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suppliers of menswear . But in choosing which catalogues to include here , the guiding principle must be a concern for the firms that are accustomed to a national or international business . Each of the firms listed below is so . Each guarantees every item sold , and with the general exception of merchandise that has been monogrammed , will exchange , substitute , credit , or refund money according to the stipulations in the catalogue . Learn to look for the guarantee ( usually found on the order form page ) , along with other specific and pertinent information about shipping procedures , gift certificates , measuring charts , gift wrapping , sales tax , and such . The Lands ' End Direct Merchants Catalogue is an absolute exemplar of clear , concise prose on this point of guarantees : " If you are not completely satisfied with any item you buy from us , return it and we will refund your full purchase price . " It seems to me you ca n't say it better or fairer than that .  | Other catalogues have similar statements and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for example , actually prints photos of their telephone operators in the catalogue , so you may see to whom you 'll be speaking should you phone in your order or make an inquiry . In the edition I have before me at the moment , customers are requested to phone Greg Comar , a nice-looking chap , " if you 're wondering what type of gear to take on a fishing trip , " which does indeed lend the personal touch in this age of computers casually conversing with answering machines . These phone operators are there to help and are incredibly knowledgeable ? unlike many a clerk in many a department store ? particularly when dealing with matters of clothing , in which sizing can be a realistic fear and problem . Often measuring charts are included in the catalogue , or other instructions given concerning fit : the Shepler catalogue informs us that when buying the original " 501 " model , buttonfly Levi 's , " For a good fit , we recommend to add 1 " for waist sizes 29 ? 32 ; 2 " for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For inseam 29-34 , add 3 " ; 36 inseam up , add 4 " . " When washed , the jeans can be expected to shrink by that much , and the good folks at Shepler 's want us to understand that and order accordingly . Such advisory statements as " full cut , " " runs large , " " slight shrinkage , " " tapered , " and other admonitions relating to size should be heeded . If these statements appear confusing or vague , phone or write for further , specific information . Avirex ( 627 Broadway , New York , NY 10012 ) Avirex began its manufacturing operations as a U.S. military contractor for flight apparel and equipment in the 1930s , and with this history of technical expertise they have built the most solid reputation for producing in precise and authentic detail the complete range of jackets and other paraphernalia used by World War II aviators .

And who even knows to what use these exotic-sounding concoctions were put anymore ? Improved hygiene , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ machinery have all in great measure freed us from much of the real drudgery of cleaning . One thing has n't changed , though : Victorian magazines ? just as ours today ? were replete with a hoard of household hints and recipes , proffering ingredients as diverse as hydrochloric acid , gin ( they said it was good for removing stains from silk ) , stewed rhubarb , and fig leaves to solve the annoying and stubborn cleaning problems of the day . All of which put me in mind that maintenance is still a concern today , with all our miracle fibers and professional dry cleaning establishments . More of a concern , really , than it has been for several years , if you 've noticed the price of clothes lately . As prices continue to esca-  | late , taking care of one 's wardrobe ? you heard it here first ? will be even more necessary in the coming years . And with this in mind , I thought to offer some advice on the subject . Nothing terribly technical , mind you , these are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Common sense plus experience , you might say . The underlying philosophy of this discussion is that you have good clothes and want to keep them and wear them for many years . If you are the sort who throws everything out at season 's end and buys new , any advice is waste of breath . This is a conservation movement . I should also say at the outset that I am opposed to over-cleaning . Generally , spots , stains , and wrinkles do n't do as much harm and damage as overprocessing . Unless the situation is extreme , there is little reason to have tailored clothing or even sweaters cleaned every time they are worn . Because , one suspects , of media advertising Americans have an absolute mania for cleanliness that passeth all understanding . Cleaning and pressing break fibers and dry them out ; they become shiny , flat , and weak . Localized treatment for spots is best , and do n't mind a few wrinkles . Good flannels and tweeds , for example , actually look better after they are well broken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labels on your clothing . They are affixed there by law and will tell you exactly what kind of fabric you are dealing with . It 's as important to know what type of fabric is stained as it is to know what caused the stain . Labels will also relate cleaning information ( such as " Dry Clean Only " ) , which is particularly important when dealing with synthetics and blended fibers ( where the manufacturer 's guidelines should be followed ) . 2 . Brushing and airing are still the best ways to keep clothes clean and fresh . Brush your clothes after wearing them to remove dust ( an abrasive that damages cloth ) , and hang them somewhere to ventilate ( in order to get rid of stale tobacco smoke , other odors , and moisture ) . Then hang them in a clean closet . Never throw them on a chair , where wrinkles and odors will set . Anyone who drops his clothes on  | the floor to lie there or for someone else to pick up is beneath our contempt and concern . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which should never be hung up ( it causes stretching ) , but rather folded and kept in a drawer . Luxury knits , such as cashmere , may be wrapped in tissue paper to prevent wrinkles and pilling . 3 . Always remove stains and spots as quickly as possible . Try the least harmful method first , and test solvents on an unimportant piece of the garment ( such as the inside of a cuff or seam ) . Have a reliable , easyto-use book handy for information on specific stains and their removal ( Best Bet : Home and Garden Bulletin #62 , prepared by the U.S. Department of Agriculture and available from the Superintendent of Documents , Government Publications , Washington , D.C. ) . 4 . As an alternative to pressing , which is harmful to fabric , many wrinkles can be steamed out by hanging the garment in front of a boiling tea kettle for a few minutes , or in the bathroom when you are taking a shower . In general , iron and press clothes as little as possible , since it causes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fibers , particularly at the creases . Never iron directly on woolens or silks . Use a slightly damp and very clean cotton or linen cloth ( such as a handkerchief or tea towel ) , always start with low heat you can always increase it , but a too-hot iron will cause real and permanent damage ? and never bear down hard . 5 . Learn to sew on buttons properly : it 's cheaper , quicker , and less harrowing than leaving it to someone else . With all the shoddy workmanship around these days , buttons are bound to come off , and there are few things more infuriating or potentially embarrassing than missing buttons . The rules are : use good thread ; make sure the proper side of the button is up ; use an X cross-over pattern with a four-hole button ; wind some thread between the button and the cloth to make a shank ; knot off . New buttons , by the way , can spruce up an old jacket dramatically . Tender Buttons ( 143 East 62d Street , New York City @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from genuine horn and leather to brass , gold , cloisonne , enameled , and even antique and military .  | 6 . Alterations are worthwhile . A good tailor or seamstress can turn a shirt collar and rework cuffs to give your shirt extra life ? and usually the collars and cuffs fray long before the body of the shirt is worn out . Shirtmakers , although they prefer to work on shirts they 've made ( a good reason for having them made ) , can make new collars and cuffs for your shirts if the material can be matched or if white contrasting material can be substituted . Do n't throw away a coat because the lining is worn . At today 's prices a good coat that cost $200 in 1960 costs perhaps three times that today , so having it relined ? even if the job costs $50 to $100 ? is something to consider . Table  | Table Trust alterations only to a competent tailor or seamstress . A competent tailor is one who works in quarter-inches , and any tailor who tells you he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than two inches and still have it sit properly is not a competent tailor . TIPS : 20 OF THE BEST 1 . Creases in trousers can be sharpened by rubbing the wrong side with a piece of dry soap . 2 . If a zipper is not working properly rub it with pencil lead , soap , or candle wax . 3 . Use clear polishes on handbags , briefcases , and luggage because colored polishes will stain clothing that comes into contact with the leather . 4 . The most highly recommended waterproof for leather is still silicone spray , but there are drawbacks : it darkens the leather , and since it not only keeps moisture out but air as well , it will dull and crack leather . Use it sparingly . 5 . Stains on suede can often be removed by gently rubbing with a gum eraser or emery board . Try this before going to a spray remover. 6 . To help keep colors fast add one teaspoon of Epsom salts to each gallon of wash and rinse water . 7 . To raise the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of boiling water and hold the garment , pile down , over the steam . Then hold the fabric over , but not touching , a hot iron . 8 . Never wash woolens in hot water ; do n't rub , twist or wring them , either ; do n't soak them ; and never use strong detergents . Use lukewarm  | water only and pure soap flakes ( or Woolite , or very mild detergent ) , hand-wash ( unless stated otherwise on the label ) , rinse and squeeze gently , shape , and lay on a clean towel to dry . This procedure will maintain shape and size . 9 . Stay away from antiperspirants containing aluminum salts ( read the contents ) , which are acidic in nature and may damage the fabric and leave a whitish salt stain very difficult to remove . 10 . Avoid garments that are made by " fusing , " a process by which cloth is glued together rather than sewn . When the glue starts to dry out or when the garment has been cleaned and pressed a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not be rectified . 11 . Buy good clothes brushes and use them . The best are of natural bristles ; synthetic bristles , being harder and with less " give , " tend to scratch and pull the fibers . Buy three brushes : one very soft ( for cotton , velvet , linen , and other more delicate fabrics ) ; one firm ( for woolens and tweeds ) ; and one stiff ( for suede ) . And keep the brushes clean as well . 12 . A small , low wattage light bulb kept burning in a closet will often provide enough heat to prevent mildew , and at small expense . 13 . Smooth leather clothing may be safely cleaned by a simple washing with soap and water ( lukewarm ) . This is recently possible because all leather processed since 1960 has been tanned with a chemical agent called glutaraldehyde that insures that the leather will remain pliable and will not crack , stiffen , or lose color . 14 . Pilling of sweaters can be minimized by turning them inside out to wash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a safety razor . This operation should be done slowly . 15 . Moths are known to attack woolens , cottons , and furs . Hot sunlight kills moths , as does dry cleaning ( moths prefer soiled garments ) and mothproofing ( with a stainless insecticide that is not harmful to humans ) . Clean the garments , put them in mothproof containers , and sprinkle with moth crystals . Potpourri and herbs are claimed by some to be just as effective as moth crystals and balls , and they certainly have a more pleasant odor.  | 16 . Old wives ' tales notwithstanding , a wet umbrella should be left open until it is dry , to prevent streaking , mildew , rust , and wrinkles . 17 . Neckties should be hung up , to unwrinlde and refresh them . Always unknot the tie immediately after wearing . Tiecrafters Inc. ( 116 East 27th Street , New York City ) will revamp old ties : dry cleaning , relining , pressing , and narrowing . It makes them like new again , and the prices are reasonable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoes when the shoes are not being worn . Shoe trees absorb moisture and odor and put the shoes back into shape . Never , by the way , dry shoes over heat ( which will shrink and crack them ) ; dry them naturally . 19 . There 's little use fooling around trying to clean suede or shearling coats ( apart from the odd spot ) . It 's best to send them to an expert cleaner when they are dirty and soiled . Less than specialized methods here may well ruin a costly garment . 20 . Candle wax can be removed from fabric by placing a sheet or two of tissue paper over the wax and gently ironing ? the heat will melt the wax and the paper will blot it up and absorb it . p 179 PACKING Not packing properly can ruin both a business trip and holiday , and whether one is planning an overnight trip or a month 's excursion there are several rules and procedures to follow that can make packing less burdensome , complicated , and threatening . The first point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what you are going to need on the trip and be sure it 's clean and well-maintained before packing . Few things are more frustrating and infuriating than arriving at your destination to discover shirts or jackets with missing buttons , unmatched socks , or broken cuff links . Inspect your clothes well in advance , and if a particular garment has n't been worn for more than a season or so better try it on to make sure it fits properly ? most of us have weight fluctuations from season to season . See that the clothing is clean . Dealing with laundries away from home can be very risky , and even though it may be heavier to lug a few extra shirts , the added weight is preferable to trusting unfamiliar laundries , a list of whose combined atrocities would turn Attila the Ilun pea-green with envy . I once got a batch of shirts back from a laundry in London so stiff with starch I thought they 'd been dipped in cement . So have your laundry done at home where you know and trust the quality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's helpful  | to have shirts professionally cleaned , folded , and sealed in plastic wrap ? keeps them cleaner and easier to pack . Decide how many changes you 'll need and for what occasions ? and pack an extra change or two as insurance against emergencies . The second general point is that fabrics are like wines : some travel well and some do n't . Avoid clothing made of fabrics that need constant care and attention , such as thin silks or linens , which tend to wrinkle at a gaze . Blended fabrics containing a small amount of synthetic fiber ? 35 percent or less ? are usually lighter and more wrinkle-resistant than 100 percent natural-fiber fabrics . Polyester-cotton shirts and underwear , for instance , can even be acceptably self-laundered should the need arise . They need little or no pressing and dry faster . Third , always coordinate the travel wardrobe carefully . Clothing on a trip must do double and triple duty , and complete changes of outfits for every occasion are a luxury denied most of us these days . Stick to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If business attire is required , a gray suit and navy blazer are always appropriate . The appearance of both may be conveniently varied with different shirts and ties ; the suit may be broken up and the trousers worn with the blazer or another jacket ; and the blazer can easily be dressed up or down by one 's haberdashery to fit the occasion . A pair of black calf slip-ons ? in a plain style , without all the hardware and gewgaws ? works well with suits , sports jackets , even polo shirts and slacks ; and since shoes are among the heaviest items in the wardrobe , these soft lightweights are an excellent travel shoe . Light blue business shirts ( in either straight or button-down collar ) show less dirt than white ones , can be worn with almost any color of jacket or trouser , and are generally flattering to the appearance . A basic slip-on V-neck sweater , dark gray socks , discreetly patterned neckwear , appropriate underwear , and a travel raincoat complete a basic business travel wardrobe . As the wardrobe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grooming kit . Grooming supplies such as bottles of cologne and tubes of toothpaste can add up to several pounds , and the solution is to use lightweight containers and take only what is necessary . Most drugstores sell travel sizes of toothpaste , deodorant , shave preparations , and the like as well as those gigantic family-size tubes and jars . One plastic throwaway razor ( sold in every pharmacy ) provides dozens of shaves , and they 're inexpensive and lightweight . Alternatively , fill small plastic bottles  | and jars with the amount of toiletries you 'll need , which is even less expensive than buying the travel-size variety , whose packaging costs are a larger percentage of the price . But while the idea is to lighten the load as much as possible , it 's prudent to provide for emergencies . A small sewing kit ( including two or three needles , plastic thimble , four small spools of basic colored thread , and perhaps a tape measure ) comes in handy ; even buttons that were checked and found snug and secure at home have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big sales meeting is scheduled to begin . An extra pair of eyeglasses and a more than sufficient amount of any necessary medications do not constitute a wretched excess of weight ? and always carry the prescriptions for medicines and eyeglasses as well , since in addition to other considerations , they help to alleviate the suspicions of rummaging customs inspectors who understandably prefer that all drugs be properly accounted for . The next consideration is the type of suitcase in which to pack the necessities of the trip . In the past quarter-century the basic nature of suitcases has changed for two reasons : first , more and more people have been traveling by plane ; and second , more plane passengers are now preferring to carry their own luggage rather than entrust it to porters and wait at the end of the plane ride for it to spill onto the revolving carousel at the baggage claim area . Consequently , heavy woodenframed and leather-covered suitcases are on the wane and air-weight , soft-construction carry-ons are preferred . The primary criticism of the newer soft luggage is that it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite true . But if you carry your own bags and avoid the various abuses of baggage-handling systems , and if you pack properly , your clothes can be as secure and well-maintained in soft luggage as in hard . The trick is to select the right luggage and to pack properly . First consideration when selecting carry-on luggage : size . Airlines restrict the size of bags that are allowed to be carried on the plane and are well within their rights to refuse to let you board with carry-on bags that exceed those limits . While there are some slight differences in the dimensions each airline allows ( this information is customarily printed somewhere on the flight ticket ) , they are all comparable : a carry-on underseater may be as large as 20 inches ( length ) by 12 inches ( depth ) by 8 inches ( height ) without incurring the wrath of the authorities ; garment bags are all approximately the same size ( about 45 inches  | long , 25 inches wide , and 5 inches deep when open ) . If the trip is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a garment bag with pockets to hold extra shirts and other accessories will probably suffice . For a trip of a week or more probably the underseater and garment bag will be necessary . Buying good quality , well-constructed , and welldesigned luggage at the outset is the best value from all points of view . Good soft luggage is well made : no chintzy zippers , badly sewn seams , flimsy fabrics , or other signs of cheap materials and shoddy workmanship . Points to look for : handles that are large and padded , and doublesewn or riveted to the bag ; a detachable shoulder strap with a wide , padded area for additional shoulder support and comfort , and soldered D-ring hardware ; zippers that are double-stitched , with large pull-tabs and solid brass locks ( which are not to prevent theft since the whole bag can be easily taken ? but to prevent accidental opening ) . Any other hardware should be kept to a minimum , and all buckles and straps , snaps , and other fastenings should be placed where they wo n't snag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plastic skids on the bottom of an underseat bag keep it from directly touching a wet pavement should you have to set it down there . While leather has been the traditional covering for hard suitcases , soft luggage is found in an ever-increasing list of materials : polyurethanes , vinyls , nylons , and treated cottons are the primary ones of the moment , while space-age technology is developing new ones yearly . All are easy to keep clean and are amazingly lightweight compared to leather . Polyurethane is a bit more pliable than the vinyls , some of which have a tendency to crack under extreme temperatures . In many respects nylon luggage is a good choice : it comes in a variety of weights ( from four-ounce twill to eight-ounce pack cloth and eleven-ounce Cordura , a very abrasion-resistant fabric made by Du Pont ) and colors ( from fashionable primary shades to pastels and high-tech black and gunmetal ) and is usually treated with urethane or some other waterproof coating . Cotton canvas luggage , first popular as field-and-stream bags with rubber liners , also is found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waterproof interior backing of vinyl or some other type of plastic . If the seams are sewn correctly and welted , all of these types of bags should provide as much protection from dirt and moisture for your belongings as hard cases do .  | Catalogues such as L. L. Bean , Lands ' End , and Orvis and practically every department store sell dozens of brands and styles of soft luggage . Apart from concerns of construction and size , choice depends on design and price . Most bags come in a choice of colors that fall into three categories : 1 . the khaki and olive greens of traditional game bags , usually trimmed in saddle leather ; 2. bright colors such as red , yellow , royal blue , and orange ; and 3. the sleek high-tech looks of gunmetal gray and black . The other basic element of design is found in the compartmentalized exterior and interior pockets , flaps , and closures . Outside pockets should be easily accessible , and if they are needed to hold something more valuable than a magazine , should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compartments should preferably have a sensible mix of large and small areas of adjustable partitions that can be rearranged to suit your packing needs ; and an interior zippered waterproof pocket is very handy for storing not-quite-dry items . The effective way to pack luggage , whether it be an underseat soft bag or a molded two-suiter , is to pack tightly , because then you can determine where the creases will fall . Clothing gets wrinkled more and worse when it is packed loosely and gets jumbled and tossed about in the bag . The rule is to make sure that everything in the bag is securely in place and stays there ! While luggage comes in a great variety of shapes and sizes , let 's say , for the sake of simplicity , that we are dealing with a basic box-shaped compartment and want to fill it with a full complement of clothing for a business trip of several days . First fold the trousers in half slightly below the knee and lay them in the bottom of the bag against the near side . Against the far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stuffed with rolled socks ) , soles down and in shoe bags . Next go in shirts ( in professional laundry bags ) and folded pajamas . Now fill in the spaces with tightly rolled or folded underwear , handkerchiefs , and anything else that can be conveniently squeezed into those little areas to prevent the load from shifting and tumbling about . The bag should now be about half full and the top layer as flat as you can make it . Then lay in the ties , folded in half and either secured in a tie bag or wrapped in tissue . Next the sweater , folded as little as necessary , and travel robe . Finally , the jackets will go on top . There are probably more systems  | for folding jackets in a suitcase than there are pastry shops in Paris , and after trying most of them ( the folding systems , not the pastry shops ) , here 's the one that I think works best . First check that all pockets are empty , that any pocket flaps are laid flat , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lining-side down and completely open on a flat surface , like the bed ; next fold the shoulders in towards the center of the jacket until they just touch , and fold the sleeves in half ; then turn the outeredges of the jacket in to the center until they touch ; finally , fold the jacket in half lengthwise . At this stage you will have a long , thin bundle to set in the bag . If it 's a bit too long , fold it crossways at the waist . Two jackets folded this way may conveniently be placed side by side on top of the bag , and when shaken out should be relatively wrinkle-free . You may he thinking that I have neglected to pack your toilet kit ,  | but actually I 've found from experience that it 's best not to put the kit in the suitcase . I 'm not primarily concerned that a bottle will shatter , saturating the contents of the bag with after shave or anything like that , because ( we hope ) the toilet kit will be leakproof @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suitcase become temporarily lost or permanently stolen , you can still shave and generally freshen up for an appointed business meeting if you 've carried the toilet kit with you separately . This advice also pertains to any business papers , cassette tapes , and other documentation , as well as medicines , eyeglasses , passports , money or checks , and jewelry or other valuables . Identification should be placed on both the inside and outside of the bag . Some travelers use business addresses on these tags , to foil thieves from ransacking their homes after stealing their luggage . And finally , remove any old airline destination tags that may still be left on luggage from previous trips ? this may help curb airline luggage 's natural desire to say bye-bye at the terminal and fly off to spend a week by itself somewhere . p 186 THE POLO COAT Well , you know , " I said offhandedly to the Maharajah of Jodhpur , " all male costume in the West derives either from warfare or sport . " Not the sort of conversation I have every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good fortune to be introduced to the maharajah at a party , and a charming gentleman he is too . We got into a breezy discussion of one thing and another , and the subject of clothes somehow came up . I asked him if it were true , as I had read , that one of his ancestors had in fact designed the polo trousers known as jodhpurs . He confirms that it was his great-grandfather . " And of course , " he reminded me , " not a few masculine articles of attire have come from the sport of polo . " Whether as played first in India , or later in England and the United States , polo has provided our everyday wardrobes with a list of items unparalleled in variety and dash : the button-down collared shirt ( designed to prevent the collar points from flapping into the face , and still called a polo collar by Brooks Brothers , who introduced it to this country from England in 1900 ) ; the polo sweater ( alternatively now called a roll-collar in Britain and a turtleneck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boot that extends slightly above the ankle and fastens with laces through two eyelets ; the name derives from " chukker , " a period of play in the game ) ; the polo belt ( a wide , usually leather or coarse-woven wool surcingle , and a very popular fashion item with women at the moment ) ; and the polo shirt ( a knitted pullover with attached knit collar and placket front , in either cotton or lightweight wool ; the famous Lacoste alligator shirt is the most prevalent example ) . All of which have been freely adopted even by those of us who do n't know a polo mallet from a sledgehammer . And then there is the most distinguished offspring of the brood : the double-breasted , patch-pocketed , half-belted camel-hair polo coat , the aristocrat of topcoats . There have been few outercoats in this century that have had more acceptance than the polo coat . The chesterfield with its sophisticated velvet collar , the jaunty trench coat , the British warm , the truncated car coats of the 1950s , and the toggle-fronted duffel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But the classic polo coat has always been considered the best-looking topcoat a man can wear . Perhaps the associations one makes in part account for its allure : Saturday afternoon football games in crisp autumn air , tailgate picnics , early spring boat races . In part it is another fine example of the peculiarly American penchant for clothes that combine elegance with comfort , that casual dressiness that has always typified our college campuses . And in part it is the polo coat 's ability to perfectly adapt to any mood , to dress up or down and be equally at home with flannel town suit or casual sweater and slacks . Some men are even able to carry off a polo coat with evening dress , but this sense of style is a nameless grace that no method can teach . Actually , the origin of this most American of coats is , funnily enough , not American at all . About the fin of the last siecle English polo players began to devise a casual robe-like coat to throw over their shoulders between periods of play ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while they waited for play to resume . At first any old coat was pressed into service , but then gentlemen began to develop ideas about how this coat should function , and their ideas were translated into what came to be called " wait coats " by English tailors . In the 1920s , when polo began to be popular in this country , and intemational matches held on Long Island , the English wait coats did not go unnoticed .  | There was a long definite swagger and cavalier deshabille about th combining as they did the comfort of a robe , the warmth of a top ( and the aura of an expensive and elegant sport . They were mi appealing to undergraduates on summer leave , and as fall terms an " polo " coats were soon seen on Princeton 's Nassau Street , in 1 Haven , and in Cambridge . By 1930 , the polo coat outnumbered raccoon at the Yale-Princeton football game , which was as sure a tonal barometer as could be found ! In the past decade or two , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? particularly of the parka var which more and more men seem to be wearing even with busi attire ? but a steady decline of quality , which in tandem make it difficult to find a true polo coat . I do n't mean some bilious polye and-wool belted horror that passes itself off as a polo coat , I mean Real Thing . And the requirements of the genre are explicit and si an authentic polo coat is double-breasted , full-length , and full-cut cal hair cloth ; it has patch pockets , set-in sleeves , cuffs , and a half-1 You could always have one done for you by a tailor whose ski worthy of the cloth and cut . One thinks of Anderson &; Shepp Poole , or Huntsman in London , or Fioravanti in New York pert for ready-made Chipp or Brooks in New York , Louis in Boston , W Bashford in San Francisco , those stores . Regardless of the source , price will not be cheap . Top quality 100 percent camel-hair c probably costs considerably more than a real camel these days : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minimum of four yards ne ( to make a coat . Hand-tailored , with real horn buttons and top qu lining , and you begin to see where this kind of thing can lead . It lead to over $2,000 easily for custom-made , and close to half that the-rack . While we are on this matter of camel-hair , by the way , you want to know that the cloth can not be woven from the hair of just old camel . The beast we are here concerned with is the rather sp ( 13actrian camel , which is actually a cross-breed of the dromedar ) Arabian ) and the Asian ( he of the two humps ) . The coat of the for possesses great heat resistance , and the coat of the latter great resistance , and ideally enough , of the coat of the cross-bred Bact combines both qualities ( and the animal has two , not just one al  | half humps ) . Not just a special camel , but special hair on that special camel . Hair on a camel ( or any animal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of uniform quality with respect to strength , thickness , color , and coarseness . There are basically three grades of camel hair , distinguished by fineness : the best is obtained from the thick , soft undercoat , and it is this that is used for quality cloth in quality clothing . The other grades ? each from the outer coat ? are used for less expensive fabrics and yarns : carpet yarns , pack blankets , interlinings , that sort of thing . The reason that first-grade camel hair produces one of the true luxury cloths is that it perfectly combines warmth , lightness , and beauty . Any other cloth of natural fiber would have to be several times as heavy to produce the equivalent warmth of camel hair . Its other quality ? one it shares with cashmere and vicuna ? is its incredible softness , which in fact presents something of a problem . Pure top-quality camel hair is so soft that , like all delicate cloths , it wears rather badly and is not all that durable . Polo coats of 100 percent first-quality camel-hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and lapels and buttonholes , rather quickly . This upsetting feature has led cloth and clothing manufacturers to experiment with blended cloths to overcome the delicacy of camel hair . A blend of roughly 50 percent camel hair and 50 per cent good lambswool achieves a perfect fabric for the polo coat : it combines maximum warmth with minimum weight and is durable enough to last for years of wear . Blending the camel hair with wool to make it a bit tougher also ameliorates the other problem of luxury fabrics : garments made from delicate and soft cloths tend to bag and lose their shape . In a coat , shoulders sag , the front may lose its line , lapels can droop , and wrinkles become a problem ; if a person sits in the coat a great deal , the seat will wear away or become shiny . And since the polo coat in particular has set-in sleeves ( rather than raglan ones , in which droop is not such a problem ) , shape retention is rather more difficult to achieve than in other topcoats . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improves the quality of the garment not to mention reducing the price .  | POLYESTER There has been a battle waged of late by the producers of polyester to portray their product as luxury fabric . Their advertising message is that it is as comfortable as cotton and as elegant as silk , yet is better than both , in their words , " because its good looks are n't interrupted by wrinkles . " While polyester has been with us a very short time , it is now perhaps the most prominent of the large group of synthetic fibers ( also called man-made , as opposed to , for instance , cotton which is made by plants or wool which is sheepmade ) used in the manufacture of clothing . Synthetic fibers are produced from chemicals . The first chemical fiber was invented in 1884 from cellulose by a Frenchman named Hilarie de Chardonnet . Rayon , the generic term for regenerated cellulose fibers ( which are derived from trees , woody plants , and cotton ) , however , was not produced in quantity until the invention of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ product was known as " artificial silk " and was first produced in the United States in 1910 by the American Viscose Company . Its considerable success led to the hope of creating an entirely synthetic fiber ? that is , a fiber chemically created rather than found , even in a raw state , in nature ? and this was finally accomplished in 1938 when nylon ,  | the first truly man-made fiber , was invented and processed by Du Pont . Today there are about two dozen general categories of synthetics , the names of some bearing more of a resemblence to drugs than fabrics ( such as Nytril , Novoloid , Vinylon , and Milium ) . One such fiber , of woven Aramid with the trademark " Kevlar , " is used in the manufacture of antiballistic clothing by a New York-based company called Emgo U.S.A. The firm advertises their line of sports vests , suburban jackets , and apres-ski coats as " protective outerwear for today 's active life-styles , " and their media information sheet leaves little to be imagined about their definition of " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. someone is being robbed or mugged , and 60 per cent of these crimes last year were armed assaults .

Clothing has always protected people against the natural elements . We 've just taken it one step further ? now it can guard against the unnatural elements as well . " The sports jackets , which have been tested against high velocity rifles , 38 Specials , and 357 Magnums , are available in six fashion colors and with coordinating accessories . Obviously in a life-style that active one has more to worry about than a few wrinkles . Most synthetic fiber in this country used for clothing is polyester , which takes its name from being composed of polymers ( molecular structures ) made from petrochemicals . These polymers are processed into filaments of polyester , textured ? usually to resemble some material we would be familiar with ? and made into yarn . Finally the yarn is manufactured into either 100 per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Fortrel , Trevira , and Zefran ) or blended with natural or other man-made fibers to produce percentage-blended cloth . Fiber content labels on clothing reveal by law the nature and percentages of these blends . The primary reason for using polyester fabric for clothing is its low cost . The production cost of polyester fiber is about three-fourths of the cost of cotton fiber production , for example . Interestingly enough , synthetics generally have something of an image problem , even though they account for over 60 per cent of the total textile fiber business in this country . In fact , last year 's statistics indicate that while the combined production of cotton and wool did not exceed 3,200 million  | pounds , there were 9,600 million pounds of polyester fiber produced ! Despite these enviable statistics ? envied of course by the cotton and wool producers ? polyester has never really been thought of as a luxury fabric ; we associate it more with the much-joked-about leisure jacket than the custom-tailored suit . Better tailors in fact rather shudder at the thought of working with polyester @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . Originally touted as a release for housewives ( and perhaps bachelors ) from a sizable portion of domestic drudgery by providing relatively maintenance-free clothing ? meaning that the clothes could be machinewashed and dried , and then worn without the necessity of ironing ? polyester 's advantages were more than spurned : they were made to look lower-class . Better clothing manufacturers began to boast that their garments were made from 100 per cent natural fabrics , and haute fashion indeed started to flaunt those very aspects of dress that synthetics were noted for eliminating : wrinkles . Designers have seemed to emphasize their disdain for synthetics and their collections have , in many cases , taken on an increasingly corrugated look , outward messages in graphic terms that the wearers are rich enough to afford the more expensive natural-fibered clothes , and probably do n't do their own laundry either . For those wealthy-but-unschooled folk who do n't actually know whether they are looking at , say , linen or polyester , designer labels often include the message " Guaranteed to Wrinkle , " which translates as " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mastercard , but here technology and science must take a back seat to gentrification . " The mind does tend to slip its moorings a bit when reverse snobbery like that turns the world upside down , and it is only the poorest among us who are wrinkle-free , but this recent development does indicate that fashion is indeed responsive to significant social and economic laws . Analyzing the psychological and economic bases of social institutions in his Theory of the Leisure Class ( 1899 ) , American social scientist ' I'horstein Veblen argued that conspicuous consumption and conspicuous waste were the very mainsprings of fashion ; and were he alive today , Veblen might well have thought this wrinkle-mania an ironically amusing example of his theory . Whether or not one agrees with Veblen , it is difficult to call polyes-  | ter a " luxury " fabric without destroying the social implications of that word completely . It is truer to say that polyester is the workhorse of the garment industry , and that it has changed the patterns of clothes-buying since the 1950s . Today , as with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people have larger wardrobes than ever before . Instead of buying one good cotton shirt for , say , $30 or $40 , some people prefer to buy two , three , or even four synthetic shirts . And when they grow tired of them , they are thrown away and replaced by others . Some people are happy to do this , just as they are happy to eat their meals at fast food restaurants . While 100 per cent polyester garments are generally not considered appropriate for business wear , blended-fabric clothes do have their place . Since they are relatively wrinkle-free , synthetic-natural fiber shirts and tailored garments are quite good for travel , especially in warm weather when lighter-weight clothes are worn . Because natural fibers still have greater porosity , allowing the body to breathe easier , the blended fabric should contain only the amount of synthetic fiber necessary to inhibit wrinkles . What is the ideal blend ? In polyester-cotton fabrics the amount of synthetic can be as little as 5 per cent or as much as 85 per cent , depending on the manufacturer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ garments themselves ( either stamped on the fabric or printed on the label ) ? but there is much disagreement about what constitutes the proper blend , and personal taste plays its part . If avoiding wrinkles is the goal , then the more polyester the better ; but particularly as the amount of polyester rises above 40 per cent , fabrics tend to take on a shiny look and a slippery hand . Polyester simply does not look or feel like cotton , and whether in shirts , pajamas , robes , underwear , or what have you , the amount of synthetic should be kept to less than half . More than that and , it seems to me , the avoidance of a few wrinkles is outweighed by a loss of porosity and a slick look . Basically the same rule applies to tailored garments ( trousers and jackets ) , when a small amount of polyester can be of value for warmweather wear . For example , linen trousers and jackets are so susceptible to wrinkles that they begin to crease as you put them on . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this problem was to make the linen as heavy as possible , which rather negated its value as the summer fabric it was intended to be . Today a small amount ? perhaps 35 per cent or  | a bit less ? of polyester can be blended with lightweight linen to produce an admirable summer suiting that resists wrinkles and yet retains the look and feel of natural linen . It is , to my mind , superior to natural linen . Tropical-weight worsted , the other stalwart summer suiting , will also not suffer drastically by the addition of a like amount of synthetic , as in fact most lightweight worsted suiting has been blended with polyester for the past two decades . The important point to remember , in this battle between the natural and the man-made , is that trade-offs must be made : you can have fewer wrinkles , but you will sacrifice some aesthetic qualities of the natural fiber and can lose some comfort . The solution ? in those situations where the blended fabrics have their place ? is to minimize the losses . Polyester @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unassailability has its price . This indestructibility has in fact been brought into poetic light by John Updike . " Terylene " is a British trade name for polyester .
