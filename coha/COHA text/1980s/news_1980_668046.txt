They sat for more than a minute in silence , wondering what was going on and how the situation could be changed . The Bruins had played a terrific first period . It ' s not possible to play a better brand of hockey than they had just played . Still , they were in a scoreless tie with the Pittsburgh Penguins and faced with a repeat of Tuesday night ' s horror . That was the first game of the first round of the best-of-five playoff series and the Penguins , definite underdogs , won , 4-2 . Now , there was the possibility of another loss , which could have meant a rapid conclusion to the hockey season in this town . There was nothing else on the mind of anyone in that locker room last night . They knew they had to get a goal , and get it in a hurry , for the longer the drought went on , the better Pittsburgh ' s chances became . But the Bruins ' fears didn ' t last too long in the second period . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Middleton beat Greg Millen , Pittsburgh ' s sensational young goaltender , to break the ice . The Bruins came through with a 4-1 victory , evening the series at 1- 1 , and now they will be going to Pittsburgh with confidence for the two games there . " It wasn ' t a pleasant feeling after that first period , " Mike Milbury , who excelled on defense , admitted . " Guys were fighting to stay loose , and you know when the situation ' s like that , loss of poise is only a short space away . That can be followed by panic . Ours is not a team like that . But in a situation like this , with time runing out , anything can happen . That ' s why something had to happen for us . That ' s why we needed a springboard to relaxation . Because when were are relaxed , when we are loose , when we are playing our own game , we can win . " Milbury played a leading role in the scene that set the Bruins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfect pass that led to the first goal . " That hole was big enough to drive a truck through , " he said . " All I had to do was pass somewhere near correctly and Rick could do the rest . But it was Brad Park who made the play . " He was back in our zone . He had the puck . He drew two defenders to him and he made the perfect pass to me . Rick made the right move through the hole . All I had to do was make sure the pass was on his stick , not in his skates . Rick did the rest . " Middleton was surprised at Millen ' s reaction when he started in . " I thought he ' d wait until I made my move , " Middleton said . " Instead he came out , went to his left , and I had an open net . Thanks for all favors . " That was followed by two more goals , one by Don Marcotte on a beautiful two-on-one situation with Peter McNab , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that broke through Millen ' s glove , ending the concern . The optimists now figure that the victory spells the end for the Penguins . The thinking is that Pittsburgh ' s game plan has been revealed . But the realists think otherwise . " I ' m happy and satisfied with what we did , " said Bruins coach Harry Sinden . " I thought we played well , better than we did Tuesday . Our defense was great . Brad MacCrimmon and Brad Park were exceptionally good . Don Marcotte and Wayne Cashman give us the stability we might have been lacking . " But give this a thought : the goalie ( Millen ) still was hot . I thought he was as good this time as he was Tuesday . He ' s a wonder . We had 43 shots on him and we beat him only four times . He ' s great . The series now narrows down to two of three and they have the home ice advantage . So don ' t start thinking we ' re in great shape , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No question . But it will be tough . We ' ll have to be as good if not better than we were this time . " There were things to like about last night ' s performance , although it will not rate with some of the sparklers of yore . Cashman liked a lot of things . " We never lost our cool after that first period . We never got rattled , " he said . " We played harder than we did Tuesday . We were more intense and we took advantage of our opportunities . " Brad Park , yearning for his first Stanley Cup , liked the way the Bruins wore down Pittsburgh ' s defense . " They use four defensemen . We have big guys . Something has to give , " he said . " It gave , and we took advantage . " Now it ' s off to Pittsburgh for Games 3 and 4 , to be played tomorrow and Sunday nights . If the Bruins keep shooting as frequently as they have been , take the body and forecheck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they can get the first goal .
