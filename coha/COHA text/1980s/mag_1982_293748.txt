Budget Blues <P> To the Editors : <P> <P> Why all the fuss about the budget farce April 26 ? Congress has no legal obligation to pay attention to the budget it adopts . This is why we have a $1 trillion national debt that will waste nearly $100 billion this year just to pay the interest . <P> <P> Frank C. Worbs <P> Vanport , Pa . <P> <P> With an " almost messianic faith " in his budget , the President is becoming intransigent . On the other hand , if Congress is " simply unable to act decisively , " its members should n't be approaching the electorate for a further vote of confidence . The President and Congress are only paying lip service to our economic woes . Neither truly acknowledges that we are hurting badly . <P> <P> Jill M. Bradley <P> Laguna Niguel , Calif . <P> <P> The rise in the power of political action committees ( P.A.C.s ) is alarming . The result is a breakdown of the democratic process in which rich minorities buy votes and elections with total @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continues to wonder why the public views it with contempt . <P> <P> Douglas Larsen <P> St. Paul <P> Howard Baker seems the perfect Government representative . But when the cuts concern his pork-barrel projects , like the Clinch River breeder reactor , he is not asking as much of himself as he does of other Senators .

During the past 150 years , the absence of Argentine immigrants to the islands suggests that the average Argentine does not regard the Falklands as a climatic and economic paradise . No matter whom they belonged to originally , the islands are now thoroughly British . The solution is to let the islanders decide . <P> <P> Courtney Fisher <P> Moretown , Vt . <P> <P> After 149 years of patiently asking Britain to return the islands , we Argentines had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Buenos Aires <P> Having spent several months in Argentina and the Falkland Islands , I have had the opportunity to listen to the views of ordinary Argentines and Falkland Islanders . While the Argentines care passionately about the sovereignty of the Falklands , they do n't want to live there . The Kelpers , on the other hand , have been on the islands for more than a century and care passionately about remaining under British rule . Recent British governments have been caught between the two sides . On the one hand they have respected the wishes of the islanders and , at the same time , have valued their traditional ties with Argentina . <P> Proposals acceptable to both sides could be drawn up and presented to the islanders in the form of a referendum . This would once and for all resolve the dispute and enable the islanders to continue their British way of life as well as enjoy the benefits of being officially linked to the mainland . <P> <P> Hilary Bradt <P> Bourne End , England <P> Galtieri 's Guilt       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
