It would be a hard trip . The plan was to drive west from Johannesburg across the foot of the Kalahari Desert , and then out onto the stone plains of the Namib , a desert where one might hear the voice of God as easily as in the Negev . From there back east and farther to the north , to Etosha Pan , a bare shield of blistering light , ringed by grasslands and bushveld , where , if fortune blessed us , we might find one or two black rhino . From there farther east into a nether region along the Angolan border called the Caprivi Strip , occupied by South African troops . From there south into Botswana , the spectacular game parks that harbor the Okavango Delta and the country south of the Chobe River , which teem with elephant and zebra , with giraffe and wildebeest , with impala , waterbuck , and half a dozen other antelope ; and through which , like veins of silver in a granite boulder , move lion and leopard , wild dog , hyena , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lay alone in my room on the seventh floor of the Park Lane Hotel in the Hillbrow district of Johannesburg with Roberts ' Birds of Southern Africa spine up on my chest and my eyes closed in a daydream . Would we see the firecrowned bishop , the lilacbreasted roller , the steelblue widowfinch ? Would we be dazzled speechless by the unearthly blue shoulders of the malachite kingfisher ; see maribou storks , heads bowed in ministerial gravity before the hyena-cracked bones of a fallen kudu ? Of the melodious lark 's threescore songs , would we hear one ? Would we see the saurian ostrich plunging across the desert like a beast from the Mesozoic , gunshot bursts of dust at its stride , the quiet hazel eyes searching the country ahead for a way out ? We would see all this . I would see birds I 'd never heard of ? apalises , eremomelas ? and birds whose names I stumbled over ? cisticola ( sis-TIK-ohla ) , hoopoe ( WHO-pooh ) . Some of what lay ahead I could not at that moment have imagined . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four weeks on the road , 5,000 miles in a Land-Rover , all that country and its myriad denizens from elephant grass to puff adder before us . The journey would be exhilarating . I would feel come-to-life in the presence of wild animals , uplifted by the days with them in their own country . What would make the trip hard , I thought , opening my eyes and staring into the sheet of glare from the white stucco wall of the balcony , was the memory of Johannesburg . 1 rose to shower . An American newspaper correspondent had offered to take me for a drive through the wealthy northern suburbs of the city and possibly into Alexandra , a black township adjacent to Johannesburg , if we could get past the military barricades . I had no illusion that , in the few days I had set aside for this , I would stumble on some insight into the South African rationale for apartheid ; nor did I expect banal architecture and storefront businesses , wary and ham-fisted . Nadine Gordimer , who lives here , has called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slightest reading background ? Joseph Lelyveld 's Move Your Shadow , William Finnegan 's Crossing the Line , Gardimer 's short stories , the writings of Steve Biko and Breyten Breytenbach , J.M. Coetzee 's Waiting for the Barbarians ( a book that reverberates wildly here ) ? with but a simple grasp of the oppression , the wretchedness of black life in this oddly retrograde nation , one is astonished by the look of oblivion in white faces in the streets . Lelyveld , who lived in Johannesburg in the mid-sixties and early eighties , writes of the " wilful obtuseness " of the white populace , that so many appear " deliberately numb to obvious moral issues . " The correspondent I contacted took me first into the northern suburbs ? Houghton , Park-wood , Sandton ? and then to Alexandra . The patrician homes and the fastidiously manicured grounds of the northern suburbs remind Americans most often of southern California , of Bel Air or Westwood . Alexandra is a warren of garbage-bag yurts and ramshackle sheds , a squalid settlement in which even the rudest amenities ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in evidence . I took my correspondent friend to lunch . He volunteers , from a position that seems calm and detached rather than inured , that what amazes him most in South Africa is the resilience of blacks who are repeatedly jailed and tortured . When I ask , with some apprehension , how conscientious the Bureau of Information is in controlling what writers report , he says , of course , to have nothing to do with them and that their vigilance is not constant , leaving a certain gray area , in which he endeavors to work . It is this capriciousness in law enforcement , he says , that keeps everyone off balance here . Just so had the young soldiers at the entrance to Alexandra allowed us to pass without acknowledgment , no word of admonition or greeting . When I ask my companion if he thinks that at any time soon blacks will be able to vote , to travel freely in the country , he says , with aslight note of forebearance , " This is not civil rights . This is revolution , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drive out to a farming town called Delmas , some forty miles east of Johannesburg . Arguably one of the most important political trials in South Africa has been going on here for over a year , though a Wall Street Journal reporter found that local people were largely unaware of it . Nineteen middle-aged black men are on trial for murder , treason , and related charges ? in short , the prosecution argues , for attempting the violent overthrow of the government of South Africa . On the face of it , the state 's charges seem grandly paranoid ; in the view of the foreign correspondents I spoke with , the merits of the case are specious . The men on trial were present at a violent township protest triggered by the implementation of a new system of repressive taxation . A board of black town councilors , elected with virtually no popular support and allegedly controlled by Pretoria , imposed the taxes . Five of the councilors were killed in a riot widely believed to have been provoked and encouraged by the South African police . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are about eighty here , all black , mostly elderly . My acquaintance and I are the only whites . ( Delmas was chosen as a venue partly because it would be easier to secure against demonstrations than a Johannesburg courtroom . It is also so far off in the countryside as to be inconvenient to reporters and beyond the travel means of most blacks . The Lutheran Council of Churches buses parents and relatives of the defendants here every day , a seven-hour round trip . ) I am hardly seated before I am fixed by the rigid and accusatory finger of a South African policeman , sitting before the bench . He rises from his chair and with a snap of his wrist motions for me to leave the room . In the outer hallway he says I am not permitted in the courtroom without a coat and tie . It is obvious to him that I am a visitor , come out from the city , and that l have no coat and tie . It is clear he regards my presence as a show of support for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He , departs with a summary nod and a self-satisfied smirk . There are four or five people in the hallway , among them a black man sitting with his wife in front of another courtroom . I ask if he will be here for a while and he says yes . Can I possibly borrow his coat and tie for a few hours ? Yes , certainly . The policemen on duty at the doors I have just come through gawk at each other in disbelief like callow adolescents . I nod sharply to them as I pass , to let them know all is now 52 HARPER 'S MAGAZINE /JULY in order . The officer who asked me to leave offers me a blank stare that hardly disguises his disgust . To an outsider the proceedings seem arch and sinister . The entire process of adjudication is in the hands of whites ; the defendants are all black . The presiding judge , his pale hands moving with foppish annoyance among his documents , glowers balefully , as though he senses insurrection . There is something unmistakably menacing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patriotism in the room , the undercurrent of state paranoia , than from any threat of revolution . The defendants sit together quietly , seemingly at ease in the room , smiling occasionally . One of them is testifying in Sotho , through a translator . A ceiling fan turns weakly above the bench . The trial , I am told , is likely to go on another year . the day before we leave for the desert I go downtown to Khotso House , on De Villiers Street . Six or eight human-rights and resistance groups that help blacks deal with the problems of living in South Africa are housed here , including the South African Council of Churches , the Congress of South African Trade Unions , and the Detainees ' Parents Support Committee . My conversations with these people merely confirm the plight , the wretched , dismal existence of the majority of men , women , and children in South Africa . I carry the bewildering reality of this away with me , wondering why I had to confirm it . It is because , like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fathom the reality . On the way back to the hotel , I pass through Joubert Park and stop to watch a chess game . The pieces are half the size of the players ; the board , perhaps twenty feet square , is laid out on the pavement . Observers lounge on benches to three sides . The players are two or three moves into the game and one is contemplating his next move . In the distance I can see a tide of blacks streaming toward the railway station and surging around a phalanx of buses that will remove them like a blight from Johannesburg before dusk . Here a black man ? one who apparently has permission to stay the night ? mulls his strategy . He finally makes his move , king 's bishop to king 's bishop six . Immediately he loses the piece to king 's knight on the other side . The opposing player , a straining irony , is white . I watch the black 's next move . It is clear he is going to be soundly thrashed . I sat in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paper on black rhino , and remembered something that Joseph Lelyveld had written in Move Your Shadow . He stated that people opposed to apartheid in South Africa arecompromised by " the comforts and golden cli-mate " of the country . The door to the balcony was open . I could see a thunderstorm moving across the horizon to the north , eastward toward the high veld . It is , I reflected , a sublime land . scape . You could become lost in its It is late afternoon . The Angelus light of dusk beauty . shimmers on the hills of Kalahari Gemsbok Na-tional Park , between Namibia and Botswana . are two days out of Johannesburg , sitting in We the Land-Rover in the middle of a shallow , arid basin , watching springbok graze . They are alert but not alarmed . Under these circumstances I can begin to dismantle the image of springbok in my mind , to penetrate the surface of the name . Springbok , a diminutive antelope , stand about thirty inches at the shoulder . ( The name comes from their habit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when they are threatened . ) The upper part of its body is a bright cinnamon brown , its underbelly and slender legs a nearly pure white , the two colors separated by a dark reddish-brown hand along the flanks . The horns are lyre-shaped . With binoculars and this opportunity to sit quietly with them , I begin to see that the shading is not uniform : the band on the flanks is browner in the females , redder in the males ; and it seems to pale in older animals . The younger animals are distinguished by a greater angularity in the line of each horn . The horns of the females are more slender , less massive toward the base . I try to commit these details to memory . I put the binoculars aside and try to distinguish these nuances at a distance with my naked eye . The attempt to do so is an exercise , the desire to do so part of the wish to make a respectful entry into new country . On the way back to camp we see small herds of blue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a type of oryx called a gemsbok , a large fawn-colored desert antelope . Something I had not pictured to myself , and which would emerge clearly in the days ahead , is the exquisitely complex symmetry of an antelope 's head . Look into the face of springbok , male impala , tsessebe , red hartebeest , kudu , roan , and sable antelope and you see an often subtle chiaroscuro , a pattern of shade and light that carries upward into the graceful curvature of the horns . Do young mathematicians , I muse , still find their dissertations in the development of such symmetries ? Several days later we are in the Namib Desert , in western Namibia . I have known about this desert since childhood , but there is no way to adequately prepare for such a place . The aplomb that may come with a reading knowledge of it , from a book of photographs , or a documentary film , the feeling that one has a reasonable grasp , is simply undermined . The land is too immense , too intricate always , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a characteristic so salient in some landscapes as to be both amusing and intimidating . The sense that the Namib was suddenly before us came at the western edge of a dry , scrubland plateau called the Namaland . We rose out of a bleak basin , drowsy with the afternoon heat , to find mountain ranges anchored like a convoy of warships on an improbable stone plain . The proportions of the land changed so abruptly the gray mountains seemed not only twice as high but twice as far away as was plausible . The earth gleamed with metallic light , bare-boned , utterly silent . In a gap between two ranges I saw a horizon so far off I felt giddy . We drove across the black stone desert , a landscape like foundry slag sheathed in bronze light . No color , no blade of grass softened it . And then at the foot of a stone hill we found gemsbok . Eight of them , including one but a few months old . They riveted us with stares . Where were they bound ? And from where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health seemed incongruous , the wordless stance eloquent . We camped that evening beneath a large camel thorn tree at a place called Sesriem ( " six oxen " ) , where there was water . The next morning we were up long before sunrise . Our plan was to drive to a place called Sossusvlei , far out in the Namib , a del , or oasis , where grasses and trees grow in a valley beneath dunes that tower more than a thousand feet , the highest sand dunes in the world . Occasionally huge flocks of flamingos gather here . We break an axle in the Land-Rover on the way out , so have some hours to walk . Where the stone plains give way to the dunes I find the footprints of gemsbok and at one point a few dark hairs from a gemsbok 's tail . I lift the shells of lizard eggs from the sand . They are so delicate they shatter , no matter the gentleness of my hands . 0 ne hundred miles northeast of SwakopValley here in 1918 a German surveyor named @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is generally assumed , several hundred years before by Bushmen . The most famous feature of this rock drawing is the dominating figure of a person called the White Lady . She has a white torso and white legs and is carrying a bow and arrow in her left hand . The mural is painted on a half hemisphere of granite , and the woman , in the middle at the bottom , is surrounded by zebra , a few eland , antelope with human legs behind , and two sorts of people , the diminutive Bushmen and taller Himba people with long , mud-caked hair and clay-smeared bodies . There are many stories about the mural , its meaning and origin , but I am satisfied to feel its vitality and imagination , to let it provoke rather than verify anything 1 think . It occurs to me , sitting before it , that I know virtually nothing of the human history of the landscapes we had been traveling through , save , vaguely , that Bushmen ( or San people , as they are more respectfully called now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Damara , Ovambo , and Hereo people . This strikes me as odd , my lack of knowledge , until I reflect that much of the country we have been moving through still belongs to the animals . My companions hike the mile or so back to camp on the south side of the dry Tsisab riverbed . I have discovered leopard tracks at a small water hole and follow them with difficulty across to the north side . I finally lose the spoor but not the feeling of a faint electric current in the air , perhaps days old , that tells of the leopard 's passage . On the way back to camp I find the exoskeleton of an enormous ground beetle , nearly three inches long , and the footprints of a small antelope called a klipspringer and of large rodents called rock dassies . Hyena and red rock-rabbit scats . I am delighted with these scraps of intelligence , an occasional bird song , the development of a sense of intimacy here . At one point I find thousands of stone flakes exposed on an eroded hillside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for telltale marks , until I am satisfied this is the work of human beings . Unbelievably , I have stumbled into what archaeologists call a lithic site , a place where people once made stone tools and weapons . I course the dry riverbed on the way back to camp , studying it closely . I bend down for the bone of a creature 1 ca n't identify ? a small mammal . I squat there in the last light , feeling a pervasive satisfaction . This detritus is evidence of the passage of creatures ? a hyena 's chalky scat , knapped stone , the faint spoor of the leopard . In the mural , the zebra , the Himba , and the others are striding over the land , in the timeless time . It is at Etosha Pan that I finally comprehended why the Romans were so flabbergasted by African animals ; we have our first long look at giraffe and elephant , and the black rhino . To eyes that know only the animals of the northern hemisphere these creatures seem , indeed , outlandish , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a face like a triceratops . And the zebra looks as though someone had given Przewalski 's horse to a child to decorate . These thoughts , I know , are rude ; but human history is full of such ridicule for all that seems different beyond the refuge of the familiar . It is a frame of mind , I think , that dominates when what is different ceases to be astonishing and becomes banal , or opaque . On the far-stretched savannahs at Etosha one or two animals found grazing in the distance become , as you draw closer , a dozen animals ; the dozen become hundreds , and so on , until you realize you have drawn up on the shores of a sea of them , that there is no " other side . " You are on the verge of something different from the human ; and the twentieth-century mind knows that what is here is all that is left .

REPORT 55 wrangling with the Namibian police to get permission to travel farther to the east , to enter and pass through a militarized zone along the Angolan border .

The children laugh and clap and spin wildly in the dust . The adolescents stare with sheepish grins . The older people look on with blank faces or glance up with exasperation and disapproval from whatever business they have at hand . Some do not even look up as we lumber through .

We camp for three nights at the edge of Savuti Channel , a stream bed that in wet years carries water from the Linyanti swamps in the north southward into Savuti Marsh . Water has not flowed in the channel for six years . It is thick with grasses , through which hyena approach our camp each night . The first evening they make off with several shoes before we are the wiser . They are not amusing , like the easily frightened vervet monkeys who have visited our camps . They are not belligerent and scoffing like baboons . They are eerie ? formidable , curious , big-shouldered beasts waiting in silence at the edge of the fire 's light . When we retire to our tents they enter camp . They are looking for food , but the young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleep negligent , with their tent flaps open , have been badly bitten in the foot or head . The sound of hyena laughter in the darkness is terrorizing . They are one of the few animals in all the domains humans have occupied to have struck back , lightly , like this . Out on Savuti Marsh are shoals of animals : impala , blue wildebeest , Burchell 's zebra , elephant , giraffe , cape hunting dog , lion , water buffalo . Early each morning and each evening we drive out among them . To view them from the roof of the Land-Rover , to have that completely unimpeded vision , and to drift slowly across the roadless marsh and through the fringing woodlands from clearing to clearing , water hole to water hole , to do this during the most benign and lucent hours of the day , is to feel an intense sense of pleasure , of apprecia-tion and privilege . Roberts ' Birds of Southern Africa lists nearly 900 species . In the first two weeks of the trip I have seen seventy or eighty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the marsh were great flocks of Abdim 's stork and cattle egrets , and five kinds of eagles : tawny , martial , bateleur , brown snake , African hawk . At an impala carcass I watched that many species of vulture at work : whitebacked , hooded , whiteheaded , cape , and several huge ( eight-foot wingspans ) lappetfaced vultures . These marvelous variations on the straightforward theme of large raptor and vulture were unanticipated . The most startling moments at Savuti Channel for me were those in which l glimpsed lions . I had never really understood lions . They were not an animal I was drawn to or for which I felt any special admiration . This all changed one morning in the space of less than ten minutes . We encountered two males in open country north of the marsh just after sunrise . They had the bearing of animals early at a rendezvous . They walked short distances slowly and sat , or stood staring at the horizon . Their manes were full ; they were limber , lean-muscled , fully mature animals . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and walked deliberately toward a herd of impala . In that stillness we heard the impala snort , the evacuation of their bowels . He had their undivided attention . But he was not interested in impala . The air of both cats was insouciant , becalmed . It was so quiet we could hear one of them breathing . With my binoculars I stared at the scars on their faces and forelegs , at the pattern of color along the rim of the ear , at the sheave and cord of muscle in haunch and shoulder . I began to sketch their heads in my notebook , the bold thrust of the chin , the outsize muzzle . In the days that followed we met these same two lions again and , in separate groups , the others in this Beach Boys pride ( named for white beaches along Savuti Channel ) : another mature male , as imposing as these two ; six females , one nursing a month-old cub ; and two sets of cubs , three of them about sixteen months old and three about eight months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we watched the cubs wrestle , chase , ambush , and bash one another . By meeting them under different circumstances at different times over four days , we came to some appreciation of the complex social dimensions of their lives . Staying in one place for a while permitted this . Each morning or evening when we found them , or some trace of them , I understood more clearly the way they fit into this country , into this particular landscape . 1 felt the first glimmer of an understanding of the African bush . e moved from Savuti south to an area called Moremi Wildlife Reserve , on the eastern edge of the vast Okavango Delta , an unusual , inland delta that carries the Okavango River out onto the northern edge of the Kalahari Desert , where it disappears . We set up our camp on the south bank of the Kwaai River . It is dusk and sprinkling rain lightly when we arrive . After making some tea I sit down in the makeshift shelter of a tarp and finish the day 's notes . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ huge sycamore fig tree at the foot of which we have set up our kitchen . Bats begin to flit about . Vervet monkeys arrive and sit shyly at the periphery of our activities . Burchell 's starlings and crested barbets and a single redbilled woodhoopoe cleared from the trees as we arrived ; now I hear the voices of two owls , scops and pearlspotted , both quite small . In a notebook in my lap , in the last light , I can see a set of outlines I have drawn that day to suggest the same four-square pattern in the face of hippo , elephant , and warthog . The last thing I see clearly is a small bird on the railing of the single-lane , wooden bridge over the river , hawking the air for insects . Then , suddenly , fireflies are winking , tens of thousands of them , over the reeds . From a native settlement on the other side of the river come the sounds of children fretting dogs , the timbre of human voices but no clear word , the sharp , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I will move about in the dimness making breakfast , stoking the fire , thinking again these are the voices I hear . Ian , the young guide , will smile wryly and incline his head , indicating I should listen more closely . It is , in fact , the muttering of large birds called ground hornbills , scouring the grass for insects . ) We are a long ways out . It has taken seven hours to make the eighty or so miles here , in four-wheel drive over a one-lane , two-track road . Another week lies ahead of us , in the Okavango Delta itself and in the Kalahari before we return to Johannesburg . Sitting here in the darkness ? the bellowing of hippos , now , comes downriver ? and feeling the slight weight of my notebooks in my lap , I am acutely aware of the sense we wish to derive from the meager bits of information about life that are our lot . I recall a line from a poem I read before leaving for Africa ; " We are filled with affection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ animals are really only safe anymore within these refuges , Moremi and Chohe and Etosha . Even there the pressure of poachers can be murderous ? and has been for rhino and large elephant . We are to assume , I suppose , that all things will go better if the animals remain here , do not wander . I am saddened by this endless compression of life in the modern world , the steady elimination of possibilities , the sequestering of things for their own good , to protect them from the wrath and desire of others , to hold them away from exploitation , to protect the economies they might threaten . The owls no longer call . The fireflies continue to wink . I hear a splash and a brief thrashing and turn after a moment to see Ian shift his eyes , extend his chin in the firelight toward me , to acknowledge the mystery . Perhaps a Pel 's fishing owl , throttling a young crocodile .

I think I know , I am that arrogant to think I know , what Ndebele means by outlasting anger . It is an anger I feel toward anything that stifles other life , that stifles personality . I rise from the roots of the sycamore fig and stare out over the water . Once , only a few days ago , I saw a flock of birds rise into low angles of morning light from beneath the hooves of a herd of zebra . They were carmine bee-eaters , rose-colored birds with deep blue crowns and muted green rumps . For a split second the sun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavily muscled flanks of the zebra .

Without even asking , it is what you are given out here . These gifts , the healing . ? 58 HARPER 'S MAGAZINE/JULY
