EAST // " I never thought it would end , " Army Quarterback Bryan Allem said after being sacked six times and fumbling twice during a 45-7 drubbing by Pittsburgh . Although Panther signal-callers also suffered some indignities  --  they were intercepted seven times  --  they passed for 436 yards . Pitt 's Rick Trocano completed 11 of 23 for 144 yards and two touchdowns , and Dan Marino , playing for the first time in almost a month since injuring his right knee , hit on 20 of 30 for 292 yards and two TDs . // " Into each life a little rain must fall , but I never thought the whole season would be pretty much a monsoon . " So said Coach Wayne Hardin after a 50-7 loss to Penn State left Temple with a 4-6 record . Even though the Nittany Lions amassed 471 yards in total offense , it was n't until Quarterback Jeff Hostetler came off the bench in the second period , with Temple ahead 7-3 , that they began to click . Penn State finally went in front 13-7 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before intermission . Then came the onslaught  --  31 points in the first 24 minutes of the second half . Hostetler , who passed for 111 yards and ran for 55 , scored on two short runs , and Kevin Baugh got a TD on a dazzling , gear-shifting 62-yard punt return during which he reversed his field three times . Pitt and Penn State meet next week , then go to bowls , the Panthers to the Gator against South Carolina and the Nittany Lions to the Fiesta against the Big Ten runner-up . // Two other Pennsylvania teams  --  Bucknell and Lehigh  --  won impressively . Ken Jenkins of the Bisons rushed for 191 yards and established a Division 1-AA record by finishing the season with 1,884 yards of all-purpose running as Bucknell upset Boston University 30-17 . Undefeated Lehigh beat Northeastern 42-19 as John Ahsler ran for 143 yards , Jimmy Evanko for 110 and Steve Plucinsky for 108. // Boston College and West Virginia rallied for victories . The Eagles , who trailed Syracuse 13-6 at halftime , were 27-16 winners as Shelby Gamble scored once in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second-quarter touchdowns  --  two by Walter Easley  --  enabled the Mountaineers to erase a 7-0 deficit and win 24-15 at Rutgers. // Yale clinched at least a tie for the Ivy League title , winning at home against Princeton 25-13 as Rich Diana ran for 165 yards . Visiting teams won the other Ivy games : Dartmouth scored 21 points in the fourth period to overtake Brown 28-24 ; Harvard wiped out Penn 's 14-0 advantage and went on to win 28-17 ; and Cornell beat Columbia 24-0. // PITT ( 9-1 ) PENN STATE ( 9-1 ) NAVY ( 7-3 ) // SOUTH // Georgia caught Auburn off guard on the last play of the first half and on the first play of the last half . With nine seconds left in the second period , Bulldog Quarterback Buck Belue fumbled the snap at the Tiger one-yard line , whereupon ' the clock was stopped until officials could settle who had possession of the ball . Knowing he did n't have any time-outs remaining and that the clock would start as soon as the ball was marked , Belue immediately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his teammates to line up and be ready to run a predetermined play as soon as the clock was restarted . On the ensuing snap , Norris Brown caught the Tigers napping as he zipped into the end zone to grab a pass from Belue for a 17-7 halftime lead . // Auburn protested the play so vigorously it was hit with a 15-yard penalty , applied at the start of the second half . Georgia then surprised Auburn with an onside kick , which the Bulldogs recovered and turned into another TD . Belue 's 99 yards passing , 77 yards rushing and one-yard scoring plunge propelled Georgia to a 31-21 triumph , the Southeastern Conference championship and a berth in the Sugar Bowl against Notre Dame , which beat Alabama 7-0 ( page 34 ) . // It was no easy victory for the Bulldogs , who were ranked No. 1 in the nation for the first time in 38 years . Georgia trailed 7-0 early in the second period , did n't have a first down during the opening 12 minutes and wound up with a 350-339 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on top 10-7 when he ran a blocked punt back 27 yards , and Herschel Walker made it 31-7 with an 18-yard ramble . Walker , however , did n't have one of his customary big days , finishing with 77 yards in 27 carries , eight yards fewer than Auburn 's James Brooks had in 21 cracks . Belue was Georgia 's main man . Four times on third-and-long he scrambled for first downs , keeping alive three drives that paid off in touchdowns . Rex Robinson of Georgia became the SEC 's alltime scoring leader , his 40-yard field goal and four PAT kicks increasing his career total to 261 points . // Mississippi State , which had shocked Alabama 6-3 two weeks earlier , came back from a week 's layoff to outlast Louisiana State 55-31 . Glen Young of Mississippi State broke a 24-24 tie by running back the second-half kickoff 100 yards . That started a four-touchdown , third-quarter spree by the Bulldogs . Freshman John Bond of Mississippi State , who had begun the day 's scoring by teaming up with David Ellis on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the third-period outburst . This week Mississippi State will take on Mississippi , a 20-9 victor at Tennessee , and then will go to the Sun Bowl , where its opponent will probably be the loser of the Nebraska-Oklahoma game . // For the second time in three weeks Kentucky lost in the waning moments amid confusion and controversy . On Nov. 1 a pair of pass-interference rulings against the Wildcats enabled Tulane to kick a game-deciding field goal after time had run out . Last week Kentucky led 15-14 with 34 seconds remaining and Florida in possession on its own 32 . The Gators , who had used all their time-outs , gained 51 quick yards as freshman Wayne Peace completed three of four passes . Cris Collinsworth caught the third of those throws , a 21-yarder , at the Wildcat 17 . Kentucky Coach Fran Curci argued in vain that the catch had been made out of bounds . The Gators ' Brian Clark then booted a 34-yard field goal with no time left to pull out a 17-15 victory . Florida , which was 0-10-1 last season , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ biggest improvement by any team in the nation . The Gators ' 6-game turnaround is one of the 15 best ever , and two more wins would surpass the alltime mark of eight by Purdue , which went from 1-8 in 1942 to 9-0 the next year . Florida 's final three matchups will be against Miami , Florida State and Maryland . Vanderbilt , hoping to double last season 's total of one victory , led Miami 14-7 in the second period . But the Hurricanes pulled out a 24-17 triumph . Maryland , which knocked off Clemson 34-7 , will take on Florida in the Tangerine Bowl in Orlando . That 's the hometown of Chris Havener , a Terp walk-on who caught six of Mike Tice 's passes for 107 yards and two touchdowns. // In another ACC game , first-place North Carolina defeated Virginia 26-3 ; Kelvin Bryant 's 81-yard scoring run was the big play of the day . He finished with 111 yards , while fellow Tar Heel Amos Lawrence ran for 95 yards and two touchdowns . That left Lawrence with 4,248 yards , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ George Rogers of South Carolina moved up to fourth on that alltime list by raising his total to 4,790 yards rushing with a 177-yard performance during a 39-38 triumph over Wake Forest . TD runs of two and 24 yards by Rogers gave the Gamecocks a 14-7 lead , but Jay Venuto kept rallying the Deacons with 28-for-50 passing that was good for 447 yards and four touchdowns . The last of his scoring passes was caught by Wayne Baumgardner , who latched on to 12 for 271 yards and two touchdowns . That put Wake Forest ahead 38-31 with 1:16 to be played . After completing an 18-yard toss , South Carolina 's Garry Harper unfurled a bomb that glanced off the hands of a Deacon defender and into the mitts of Horace Smith , who ran the final 20 yards to the end zone . That still left the Gamecocks one point short at 38-37 . So Harper went to the sure-handed Smith on a two-point pass that wrapped up the scoring . In all , Harper passed for 266 yards and three TDs . // Georgia Tech , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of magic against Navy , losing 19-8 . The Yellow Jackets gained only 41 yards in the first half , did n't complete a pass until late in the third period and failed to cross midfield until the fourth quarter . Tech 's defense , though more worthy than its offense , had difficulty bringing down Eddie Meyers , who ran far 148 yards . // Virginia Tech , which beat VMI 21-6 , is also bowl-bound . The Gobblers will play in the Peach Bowl against a mystery guest . // Grambling State spoiled South Carolina State 's try for a perfect season , 26-3 . That left only one unbeaten and untied team in Division 1-AA , idle Western Kentucky . // GEORGIA ( 10-0 ) FLORIDA STATE ( 9-1 ) ALABAMA ( 8-2 ) // SOUTHWEST // Not surprisingly , Grant Teaff , the Baylor coach , spent some time early last week pushing the All-America candidacy of his prize running back , Walter Abercrombie . Abercrombie then returned the favor  --  and strengthened his credentials  --  by racing 79 yards to the Rice one on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next play , he rammed into the end zone to start Baylor on its way to a 16-6 triumph that clinched the Southwest Conference championship . For the day , Abercrombie gained 168 yards . // Quarterback Donnie Little of Texas , who had been demoted to second string two weeks ago , got a chance to start once again when his replacement was hurt . Little came through , completing 12 passes in a row in one span and winding up with 334 yards in total offense while the Longhorns beat Texas Christian 51-26 . Little completed 16 of 22 passes for 215 yards and one TD , and in 16 carries he gained 119 yards and scored twice . // Arkansas , which led 24-0 at the intermission , was caught at 24-all by Texas A&amp;M after 17 minutes of the second half . The Aggie rally went for naught , however , when Ish Ordonez kicked a 27-yard field goal with eight seconds to go for a 27-24 Hog victory . // Southern Methodist 's Mustangs expected a cakewalk at Texas Tech . What they got was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Raiders tossed a 12-yard scoring pass to Jamie Harris and set up another touchdown by hitting him with a 38-yarder to the SMU one . That was enough to give Tech a stunning 14-0 win . Nevertheless , the Mustangs were one of five SWC teams to accept bowl invitations . The lineup : SMU vs. the WAC champ in the Holiday Bowl ; Baylor vs . Alabama in the Cotton ; Texas vs . North Carolina in the Blue-bonnet ; Houston vs . Navy in the Garden State ; and Arkansas vs . Tulane in the Hall of Fame . // BAYLOR ( 9-1 ) TEXAS ( 7-2 ) SMU ( 7-3 ) // MIDEAST // " The idea was Coach McCartney 's , " said Bo Schembechler of Michigan Defensive Coordinator Bill McCartney 's plan to deploy six defensive backs in an attempt to thwart the passing of Purdue 's Mark Herrmann . McCartney 's scheme worked well : of Herrmann 's 34 passes , three were intercepted by those backs and one by Linebacker Andy Cannavino . He completed 21 for a measly 129 yards . Wolverine Quarterback @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than that all by themselves , collaborating on eight passes for 133 yards and two touchdowns . That , plus 164 yards and one TD rushing by Stanley Edwards , made Michigan a 26-0 victor . The shutout was the Wolverines ' third straight . // For Iowa , the nicest thing about its 41-7 loss to the Buckeyes was that it was the last time it will meet Ohio State until 1983 . Art Schlichter riddled the Hawkeyes by completing nine passes in a row and 13 of 18 for 195 yards and two touchdowns . Two of those tosses  --  one for a TD  --  were grabbed by Tailback ' Calvin Murray , who also ran for 183 yards in 25 carries . Murray 's 208 all-purpose yards were 61 more than Iowa had all afternoon . // Michigan State beat Minnesota 30-12 , Wisconsin defeated Northwestern 39-19 , and Indiana hung on to edge Illinois 26-24 . When Mike Harkrader of the Hoosiers banged up his left knee in the first period , the tailback duties fell to Lonnie Johnson , who set up a touchdown with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ combined with Quarterback Tim Clifford to rally Indiana from an 18-7 deficit . Clifford , who 'd suffered a shoulder injury the week before , entered the game in the third period , passed for 119 yards and put the Hoosiers on top 26-18 with a seven-yard pass to Dave Harangody . David Wilson of Illinois , who completed 24 of 41 for 403 yards and three touchdowns , guided his team 84 yards for the final score , but his try for a game-tying two-point conversion on a pass was intercepted by Tim Wilbur . // Nebraska and Oklahoma both won  --  meaning that this week 's encounter between the two will decide which of them will play in the Orange Bowl against Florida State . The Huskers pounced on six Iowa State fumbles while winning 35-0 . Andra Franklin of Nebraska rushed for 104 yards on 10 carries , and Jeff Quinn ran for two touchdowns and passed for a third . Oklahoma kept pace by playing its best defense of the year during a 17-7 victory over Missouri . The Tigers , who had been averaging more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sooners . Nonetheless Mizzou earned a consolation prize : a trip to the Liberty Bowl to face Purdue . Despite injuries that sidelined starting Halfback David Overstreet and the top two fullbacks . Oklahoma rushed for 310 yards . Second-string Halfback Buster Rhymes filled in well , racking up 132 yards and scoring on runs of five and 55 yards . In other conference games , Oklahoma State defeated Kansas State 10-0 and Kansas routed Colorado 42-3. // A Mid-American Conference-record crowd of 32,139 crammed into Western Michigan 's Waldo Stadium and overflowed onto a slope nearby . The occasion : a game with Central Michigan for the league title . The crowd cheered three Central students who ran onto the field with the game ball , which had been carried by a relay of runners from the Chippewas ' campus some 100 miles away . The Broncos built a 10-0 lead early in the second quarter but from there on , it was all Central as Quarterback Kevin Northup scored twice .

" is the way Southern Cal Coach John Robinson liked to refer to it . According to Robinson 's calendar , victories over Washington and UCLA on Nov. 15 and 22 , respectively , would give the Trojans the Pac-10 title and bragging rights around Los Angeles . It would also keep Southern Cal 's non-losing streak going and perhaps make USC 's Dec. 6 confrontation with Notre Dame a battle for No. 1 . Nice dream . Washington turned it into a nightmare by winning at Southern Cal for the first time since 1964 . And the Huskies did it without their leading rusher , Toussaint Tyler , who was out with a bruised knee . En route to its 20-10 victory , Washington scored twice in the third quarter , first on Ray Horton 's 73-yard punt return and then on a 10-yard Tom Flick-to-Paul Skansi pass . Marcus Allen 's 216 yards rushing helped the Trojans to a 404-212 margin in total yardage . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't return , and Quarterback Gordon Adams went out when he tore up his right knee late in the first half . What finished off USC , though , was the loss of four fumbles and four intercepted passes . Washington thus ended the Trojans ' longest-ever unbeaten string at 28 games and assured itself of a berth in the Rose Bowl . // UCLA recovered from what Coach Terry Donahue called " a severe case of mental flu , " i.e. , successive losses to Arizona and Oregon . Providing the cure was Jay Schroeder , who came off the bench to direct three TD drives , two of which he climaxed with passes , as the Bruins won 23-14 at Arizona State . // When rookie Coach Joe Avezzano took over at Oregon State , he declared " war " on Oregon and promised to increase local interest in the annual game between the two teams . Although the Beavers were winless , Avezzano sure enough built up interest , and a record 41,600 jammed into OSU 's Parker Stadium . Oregon won 40-21 , thanks mostly to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only 14 carries . // Samoa Samoa twice slammed into the end zone from one yard out and passed to Jeff Keller for a 69-yard score as Washington State defeated California 31-17 . Arizona equaled a school record with 42 first-half points and routed University of the Pacific 63-35. // Brigham Young took over first place in the Western AC by clobbering Colorado State 45-14 as Jim McMahon continued to set passing records . He connected on 23 of 33 throws for five touchdowns , and his 441 yards through the air gave him 3,834 for the season , an NCAA mark . McMahon also extended two of his own records by passing for more than 300 yards for the ninth time in a row and by passing for more than 400 for the fifth consecutive game . // Air Force got its first WAC triumph by toppling Wyoming 25-7 . Leading the way were Scott Schafer , who had two TD passes , and Sean Pavlich , who kicked four field goals . // WASHINGTON ( 8-2 ) USC ( 7-1-1 ) BRIGHAM YOUNG ( 9-1 )    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
