Joseph Longo , 33 , a civilian American pilot , was turned over to a U.S. congressional delegation visiting Angola last week after he spent nearly ten weeks in captivity . Longo 's Beechcraft Bonanza was forced down by an Angolan jet fighter last April over Namibia , where the plane was scheduled to be delivered . " The treatment got better as time went on , " Longo said of his detention . When he arrived in the U.S. , however , Longo cited " bad food , lice and lizards " as hardships that he endured . <P> Angolan officials described his release as a " goodwill gesture , " presumably to smooth the way to the establishment of diplomatic relations with the U.S. That is a difficult goal , given the presence of 35,000 Cuban troops in Angola and the $15 million in military aid the U.S. provides to UNITA , a pro-Western rebel group trying to overthrow Angola 's Marxist government .
