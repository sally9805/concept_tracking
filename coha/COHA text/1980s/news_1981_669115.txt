These could be two of the conclusions of a study , titled " Some American Families at Dinner , " of 33 typical middle-and upper- middle-class families in Princeton , N.J. // In analyzing the findings of the videotaped observations of the New Jersey families at mealtime , Dr. Michael Lewis , researcher and director of Princeton University Educational Testing Service , found that most of the families ( consisting of a father , mother , and from one to four children ) did not always eat together , but did dine at dinner with all members present at least twice a week. // Each of the families had a three-year-old child who was especially observed by the researchers . This study of social behavior at the table attempted some measure of the inter-relationships of such functions of family dining as eating , nurturing ( expressing warmth and love ) , care-giving , and instruction in manners and conduct. // Dr. Lewis says the research provided some of the following conclusions : // * One of the most important functions of the dinner meal for families is maintaining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This ongoing , everyday conversation helps maintain continuity in all family relationships. // Much of the talk at the table , he says , is directed to informing the father about what has happened during the day . The mother informs him directly , and then questions the children so they will talk to the father directly . Later the father inquires , on his own , as to specific activities of the children , what they have been doing , and where they are going. // * Mothers talk more to fathers than fathers to mothers at the dinner table. // * Mothers engage children in conversation more than their fathers do . And children speak to their mothers more than to their fathers . In general , the parents ( mother in particular ) are the focus of verbal interaction at the table . Young children do the least amount of talking to each other. // * Middle children tend to be spoken to much less frequently than the oldest and youngest children , and also to do less speaking . Parents should be alerted to this situation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more with their sons than with their daughters and tend to increase their attention toward their older rather than their younger children . Mothers do not usually make such distinctions. // * Where there is a single child , both parents tend to direct almost all attention and time to the child , leaving little conversation for each other . Parents again begin to converse with each other after other children arrive on the scene and particularly after chldren get older and can occupy each other. // * As family size increases , each person is able to speak less , and families don ' t tend to stay around the table for longer periods so everyone can have a say . Also , the larger the family , the greater the likelihood of stress and even chaos. // * While fathers often do not concern themselves with dinner chores in a small family , once the size of the family gets past five , it takes both adults to manage the tasks  --  serve the meal , feed the children , teach and train , give care and nurturance. // Dr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself , the study had shown him how a family sitting down to dinner together has less to do with feeding and more to do with social contacts . Conversation and camaraderie are more important , he thinks , than constant nagging reminders about manners and what foods are eaten or ignored. // This is not to imply that manners should not be taught , he says , but children learn faster and more than their actions migth indicate . While still very young , they simply resort to doing the easy or expediate thing . " My own 13-year-old son , " he says , " still doesn ' t have the best of manners at home , but when he goes out he is letter perfect . So I know he knows and he knows he knows. " // The same son once scolded his father for " telling me what to do every minute . " His father , the child expert , had to stand back and try to hear himself as his son heard him . Then he decided the boy was right . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And he stopped. // " If most parents could hear themselves played back on tapes , they would become far more sensitive to their chilrend ' s needs and points of views , and stop hammering away , " he says with a laugh . " I think that normal children who have been reasonably well trained and who are presented with an interesting assortment of foods will behave themselves passably and eat sufficiently of the foods of their own choice . I don ' t have to concern myself too much with the messes small tots might make , but can teach them how to clean up those messes. // " My personal theory is to treat children like people and to apply the same proper in- terpersonal rules to my approach to them as to adults  --  neither neglecting them nor over-concerning myself with them . I believe that children learns as much from observing adults and then imitating and modeling our behavior , as they do from actual instruction . This means that parents must constantly demonstrate by their own actions and behavior what they are telling their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when a parent tells him which is the right fork to use , and then proceeds to use the wrong one . So does the child who listens to parents bicker and fuss , yet is told to be nice to his brothers and sisters. " // He believes the same principle applies to conversation . Children who listen to adults talking amiably , discussing events , and debating issues in a vital and lively way , become better and more fluent talkers themselves . They learn by emulation . It is good , he says , for parents to try to involve children in such general discussion , and to give simple explanations to youngsters about subjects they may not understand . But the child who simply listens gets a sense of the flow and exchange of ideas. // Finally , a studies have shown how often the television set has been moved into the dining area and become another " voice " at the dinner table . When TV comes in , he says , " everything else decreases  --  the amount of information seeking , the amount of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teaching . And as far as family conversation is concerned , everyone , but everyone , is shortchanged. " // //
