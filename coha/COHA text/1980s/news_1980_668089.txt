Gary Busey about carnivals : " It ' s the hardest life there is - and I was in rock ' n ' roll for 20 years . Those people can strike a carnival in three hours , travel 500 miles and set up the whole operation for business in the same day . " Busey , 36 , who won honors for " The Buddy Holly Story , " has been fascinated with carnivals since he was a kid in Tulsa , Okla . " I had a romantic affair with the fantasy of it all . " That romance has culminated in " Carny , " the new Lorimar-United Artists release for summer . Busey plays the " bozo , " the clown who goads the " marks " into buying baseballs to dump him in a tank of water . Robbie Robertson , who also produced the film , plays Patch , the carnival fixer . Jodie Foster is a waitress who joins the troupe and comes between the two friends . " Carny " is no spun-sugar and popcorn " Greatest Show on Earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patrons during tent showings in the South . Business admittedly was poor , and United Artists went back to the drawing board for a new ad campaign . The recent New York opening drew generally favorable reviews and encouraging grosses . " When it opened in the South , it was head-scratching time , " Busey observed . " The whole idea of presenting the carnival life as it really is perplexes a lot of people . It ' s something that hasn ' t been seen on the screen before , except long ago with Tod Browning ' s Freaks ' ( 1931 ) and NightmareAlley ' ( 1946 ) . But it ' s a true American subculture , with its own customs , lifestyle and language . " " Carny " originated with Robert Kaylor , a documentary filmmaker who made a study of the Georgia State Fair Carnival in 1972 . He spent two years traveling with and researching carnivals , then more years trying to put together a fictional movie . He found a taker in Robertson , the Toronto-born leader of The Band , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Robertson . As a boy he had worked in a carnival one summer . Also he was familiar with the gypsy life through The Band years and backing Bob Dylan before that . " After I read the first page of the script , I said to Robbie , Yes , sir , I ' ll do it , ' " Busey remarked . " I wanted to work with Robbie ; The Band is the reason I started writing songs . I had known him slightly , then for a year we worked on developing a close friendship , so our relationship would show on the screen . " They researched by studying eight hours of tape that had been assembled by Kaylor and learning tricks of the trade from experts . " One guy spent three hours showing us how to short-change the marks , ' which is what they call the customers , " said Busey . Filming was done in Savannah , Ga. , with 17 carnival rides imported from Gibsonton , Fla. , the winter home of the trade . " We worked five weeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recalled . " We were thrown all together - the freaks , the carnival people , the technical staff and a bunch of actors who were scared to death . " It was hard work , really hard , but I think that ' s good . All that energy gets into the movie because of the burden of emotion . It was the same with Buddy Holly . ' I was never so scared in my life . The adrenalin was pumping through me , and that was bound to show on the screen . " Busey had high praise for his co-stars . He termed Jodie Foster , who was 17 during filming , as " a girl who was hovering between Winnie-the-Pooh and Fredericks of Hollywood " ( the maker of racy lingerie ) and " an actress whose potential talent hasn ' t even been tapped yet . " About Robertson : " He has a natural romance with the camera , which he hates to hear . He is a great story teller , is subtle with movements and understands counterpoint .
