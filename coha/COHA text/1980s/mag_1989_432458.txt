 | Diana Vreeland , the seismograph of chic , died last week in New York , and the headline writers were stumped over how to sum her up . To call her a " fashion editor " seems as scanty as saying that Chanel sewed . Yes , she spent 25 years at Harper 's Bazaar and a decade as the visionary editor of Vogue . Sure , she discovered Lauren Bacall and Twiggy , introduced the Italian thong sandal , touted see-through blouses , coined " pizzazz " and heralded the " youthquake . " But she was more than a shaper of fashion news ; she was an inventor of attitude and style and , in the end , her most famous creation turned out to be herself . The jet-black slick of hair and fastidiously polished shoes . The notorious all-red Park Avenue living room ( " I want a garden , " she told decorator Billy Baldwin , " a garden in hell " ) . The legendary aphorisms that she dropped faster than her trailing underlings could scribble them down . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing since the atom bomb ! " Other famous people said extravagant things about her . Truman Capote : " A totally extraordinarily original woman . " Jacqueline Onassis : " She sees infinitely more than the rest of us see , just crossing the street . " Cecil Beaton : " A combination of Madame de Sevigne and Falstaff . " Her life embraced the century : she saw Nijinsky at the Chatelet and the Rolling Stones at Madison Square Garden . When she put the details down in her charming 1984 memoirs , " D.V. , " she did n't let facts stand in the way . She was born in Paris but did n't say when ( 1902 , maybe ? Around then ) . Her mother was American , her father , Scottish ; in old Gaelic , she claimed , their name , Dalziel , meant " I dare . " The Paris house was always filled with friends like Diaghilev or Isadora Duncan , but when World War I broke out , the family came to America .

" " But I look back on pictures of myself , " she once said , " and I 'm the jolliest soldier you ever saw in your life . " In 1924 she married an elegantly handsome banker , Reed Vreeland , and had two sons . In 1936 she began at Harper 's Bazaar , first writing the much-parodied column , " Why Do n't You ? " ( " Remember that nothing is smarter with your shooting tweeds than linen gaiters " ) , before becoming fashion editor . There , and later at Vogue , she created a fantasy world of elegant , startling images , playing classic fashion pictures off paparazzi shots , showing elongated bodies opposite , say , a zooming close-up of a bare foot . She always screamed for " More ! More ! More ! " ? swathing more pelts around a model in furs , heaping more necklaces around another 's throat .

Vreeland was fired from Vogue in 1971 . Rather than call it quits , she plunged into a new career as consultant to the Costume Institute of the Metropolitan Museum of Art . While scouring museums and warehouses from Hollywood to the Kremlin for the most sumptuous clothes ever dreamed up , her eccentric charm came in handy . Negotiating in Moscow for loans for the 1976 show , " The Glory of Russian Costume , " she enchanted Soviet officials by remarking , " In all my years of travel , I have never seen people in the streets with such . . . chic . Those cheekbones , the simplicity of the dress : I 've never seen anything like it ! " Scented air : She did n't just display clothes at the Met ; she created theater .

A few scholars may have groused about the blatant showmanship , but almost 1 million people a year came to her exhibitions . " I loathe nostalgia , " Vreeland said . When she did look back it was to remember something divine . Like a gourmande who can recall a dish eaten years before , she could evoke images of white peacocks skittering across a prewar lawn or the shade of a dress ? " red orange , not yellow orange " ? worn by a woman in the Bois de Boulogne decades ago . Otherwise she preferred to live in the moment , zeroing in on contemporary culture . " Bardot was the creature of the fifties , " she 'd explain . " She prepared the way for the sixties ... Her lips made Mick Jagger 's lips possible . " Vreeland once described her philosophy : life , outside of dire tragedy , has up-anddown trips . " You must choose one , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , bad digestion and fewer friends . The up trip is naturally delicious and never ceasing . I believe in people who are on the up trip . "
