A hood sings of point shaving <P> " I 'm the Boston College basketball fixer . It was a day 's pay , it was interesting and it gave me a nice feeling . " <P> <P> With those smug words , a small-time criminal with big Mob connections claimed that he pulled off a scheme to attempt to fix the scores of nine Boston College basketball games during the 1978-79 season . In a first-person account in last week 's SPORTS ILLUSTRATED , Henry Hill says he bribed three Boston College players , including Co-Captains Ernie Cobb and Jim Sweeney , to shave points so that Hill and his friends in the Tommy Lucchese crime family could gamble successfully against the point spread . <P> Hill , described by New York City police as a " knockabout felon , " served as an errand boy for the Paul Vario faction of the Lucchese family . When Hill was arrested on narcotics charges last year , he agreed to testify against his former friends in exchange for federal protection . <P> Among Hill 's revelations-which included solid leads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York 's Kennedy International Airport in 1978-were charges that almost as a sideline , he had rigged the outcome of Boston College games . According to Hill , he became involved in the scam when a former penitentiary pal introduced him to a friend of a Boston College reserve forward , Rick Kuhn . Kuhn allegedly enlisted the services of Sweeney , an honors graduate who proved to be a sharp negotiator , Hill asserted , indicating games that could easily be rigged and bargaining for payoffs even when the point shaving was unsuccessful . <P> Sweeney and Kuhn suggested cutting Cobb in on the deal because , as the team 's top scorer , he could most affect their attempts to beat the spread . In fact , of the nine games involved , three times the players were unable to deliver , and the spread held . The deal , Hill contended , was struck at meetings in various Boston hotel rooms and netted the players as much as $2,500 a game . Hill said he cleared some $100,000 in eleven weeks of placing bets on the rigged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of payoffs and point shaving . <P> Boston College Coach Tom Davis has reviewed the allegedly fixed games anc has said he can find nothing to indicate that his players had done less than their best . But he and other college coaches no doubt shuddered at Hill 's succinct summation of his scam : " Point shaving is sneaky ... Kids have made thousands of bad passes by mistake for nothing , so what was so bad about making just one more bad pass and getting paid for it ? "
