Fujian has eyes for Taiwan and for its native sons overseas <P> A beautiful land of rugged green hills and rich farm land , with a long , spectacular coastline , Fujian province faces Taiwan , 90 miles away across the Taiwan Strait . Closed to most non-Chinese for more than three decades , Fujian has been reopened both to foreign visitors and to foreign investment . TIME Peking Bureau Chief Richard Bernstein last week toured the provincial capital of Fuzhou and the port city of Xiamen ( Amoy ) . His report : <P> " Just arrived , " proclaims the large , handwritten sign , " new supply of nylon cloth from Taiwan . Come in and buy some . " That notice would be passed without a second glance in Hong Kong or Singapore . Pasted up in front of a ramshackle department store in Xiamen 's main town square , it is a striking sign of changing times . Largely because of its geographical proximity to Taiwan , Fujian province has become the focus of an active campaign by the Peking government to open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1979 , China stopped its alternate-day shelling of the Taiwan-held offshore islands of Quemoy and Matsu ; located less than ten miles from the Fujian coast , the islands were long regarded as symbols of the ongoing civil war between the People 's Republic and the Republic of China . Fujian authorities boast that they have built five docking shelters along the province 's coast for fishermen from Taiwan and that they have helped some 1,000 of them who ran into bad weather or engine breakdowns . Meanwhile , Fujian officials call for tours and even investments by their " Taiwan compatriots , " some of whom have visited the province via Japan , the U.S. or other countries . <P> Local officials even seem willing to ignore a small-scale but apparently active smuggling trade that goes on between Taiwan and mainland fishermen , who frequently share the same fishing grounds . According to residents of Xiamen , the trade includes soap , towels and watches ( often with fake Swiss markings ) from Taiwan and gold ( sometimes also fake ) from the mainland . If that first shipment of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Taiwan could have a significant future market in Fujian . In less than two weeks , the shipment was 90% sold , despite a stiff price of $10 a meter . <P> Peking continues to call for a resumption of postal , telegraphic and air links between the mainland and Taiwan as a first step toward reunification . If this goal were achieved , Chinese authorities insist , Taiwan would be able to retain autonomy in most areas of life , including its own social system . Says Shi Hungyao , 47 , a member of the Fuzhou city government , who emigrated to Fujian from Taiwan in 1948 : " We recognize that Taiwan 's standard of living is much higher than our own , so we do n't want to do anything to change their style of life . " Taiwan remains fearful that Peking 's long-range goal is to impose Communism on the island , which not only has a higher living standard but enjoys far more political freedom as well . When asked to specify exactly what sort of autonomy China has in mind for Taiwan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just like Tibet . " Given Peking 's tight political control over Tibet , that is not a reassuring example .
