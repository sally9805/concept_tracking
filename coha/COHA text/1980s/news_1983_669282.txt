At the same time , national debate has intensified about the method by which the British cast their votes . Although no quick changes are likely , support for a change to proportional representation has been growing since the alliance of the Social Democrats and the Liberals pulled in one-quarter of the popular vote , but gained a mere 23 seats - or 3. 5 percent - in the House of Commons. // Among the social changes , say analysts of the election results such as Prof. Ivor Crewe of Essex University : // // * Blue-collar workers are shifting away from radical socialism and toward more centrist views. // Their views appear rooted in rising home ownership and , apart from the unemployed , a slowly improving standard of living . Latest figures show rises in consumer spending and in the percentages of households owning cars , telephones , central heating , refrigerators , freezers , and washing machines. // // * The opposition Labour Party still relies on working-class votes - but trade unionists and even the young unemployed switched in large numbers to the Tories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Almost as many trade unionists voted Tory as voted Labour . Among the young unemployed ( 18-22 years old ) , half did not vote at all , and less than one-fifth went Labour. // All the parties are studying changes like these , and arguing about how to translate them into concrete political terms. // To the prime minister , the results are a resounding vote of confidence - although Professor Crewe and others see it as more of a rebuff to Labour and a flirtation with the alliance. // Mrs. Thatcher ' s immediate post-election task was to ensure that her basic monetarist policies would be carried out by people close to her and her views . She has made about 60 changes in a list of about 100 senior , middle , and junior ministerial positions at the top of government. // By no means has she purged the ' ' wet ' ' ( liberal Tory ) wing of the party . One of the most prominent , Francis Pym , was summarily sacked as foreign secretary , but others , including Peter Walker ( moved from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Northern Ireland office ) remain. // Her basic aim , aides say , has been to promote younger men and give wider experience to others already in government . She promoted eight backbenchers , gave 11 ministers more senior posts , and dismissed or accepted resignations from 14 . It is also true she wanted to reward those closest to her , and those who helped secure her large reelection margin. // These facts explain Sir Geoffrey Howe moving from chancellor of the Exchequer ( treasurer ) to the job he wanted as foreign secretary ; Nigel Lawson rising from energy to treasury secretary ; Leon Brittan from treasury to home secretary ; Cecil Parkinson from Tory Party chairman to the secretary of a combined Ministry of Trade and Industry , and Ian Gow , her former private secretary , to minister for housing and construction. // Meanwhile , a series of realignments are taking place among the ranks of the opposition. // On the one hand , with Labour leader Michael Foot ' s resignation prematurely announced by a union leader , a struggle has started among the center , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party in the next few years. // As Professor Crewe ' s research shows , the social underpinning of the Labour Party changed on June 9 . The party lost 9. 3 percent of its overall vote , as the electorate turned away from Mr. Foot ' s radical policies of giving up nuclear weapons , leaving the European Community , and borrowing money to create jobs. // Leading the race to succeed him at this point is Neil Kinnock , a relatively young Welshman and close friend of Mr. Foot , who also supports unilateral disarmament and who wants Britain to pull out of the EC. // Already , left-wing unions are lining up behind him , including the Transport and General Workers ' Union and the Communication Workers . This alarms more moderate unions , who see a Kinnock victory as continuing the leftist , unilateralist image that lost Labour so many votes on June 9. // On the sidelines are finance spokesman Peter Shore , in the moderate left , and Roy Hattersley , to the right. // The struggle will continue until October , when the Labour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold 40 percent of votes to be cast for the leadership . The other 60 percent are split between Labour MPs - who now contain more left-wingers than at any time in recent years - and grassroots constituency parties ( CPs ) . One reading here is that the far left can put together enough votes from trade unions , MPs , and CPs to elect Mr. Kinnock. // Meanwhile , the Social Democrats and the Liberal Party are holding strategy sessions of their own. // Roy Jenkins , the originator of the idea of the SDP in 1981 , stepped down from leadership to allow Dr. David Owen , a much younger man and effective on television , to lead the party . Dr. Owen is more to the left than Liberal leader David Steel , and wants to keep the SDP ' s separate identity as a left-center alternative to the Labour Party. // Mr. Steel favors close links between Liberals and the SDP , and is maneuvering to silence vocal Liberal critics who see the SDP , with only six seats in the new Parliament , as very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On changing the method of voting , the 99-year-old Electoral Reform Society favors the Irish system . Voters would number candidates in order of preference . When a candidate reaches a quota high enough to be elected , his preference votes would be assigned to others , until all seats are filled . **22;18509; <> **44;18533; **44;18579; **44;18625; **42;18671; **44;18715; <> **76;18761; **28;18839; Elected <> **28;18869; **28;18899; November 1980 <> **28;18929; **28;18959; July 1982 <> <> **76;18989; **28;19067; party <> **28;19097; February 1975 <> **28;19127; Announced <> **28;19157; July 1976 <> **28;19187; Announced <> <> **76;19217; **28;19295; Leader <> **28;19325; **28;19355; resignation <> **28;19385; **28;19415; resignation <> <> **76;19445; **28;19523; **28;19553; **28;19583; June 12 <> **28;19613; **28;19643; July13 <> <> **76;19673; <> Representation <> **26;19751; 397 seats <> **26;19779; 209 seats <> **26;19807; 17 seats <> **26;19835; 6 seats <> <> **76;19863; <> in 650-seat <> **26;19941; ( 144 seat Majority ) <> **26;19969; **46;19997; Alliance = 23 seats <> <> **76;20045; <> Percent <> **26;20123; **26;20151; **26;20179; 2. 6% <> **26;20207; 0. 9% <> <> **76;20235; <> seats in <> **26;20313; 61% <> **26;20341; 32% <> **46;20369; Alliance = 3. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Percent <> **26;20573; **26;20601; **26;20629; 13% <> **26;20657; 11. 6% <> <> **76;20685; <> popular vote <> **26;20763; 42. 4% <> **26;20791; 27. 6% <> **46;20819; Alliance = 24. 6% <> <> **76;20867; <> in June 9 <> <> **76;20945; <> election <> <> <> <> // //
