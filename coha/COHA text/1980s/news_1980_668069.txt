The Massachusetts House Ways and Means Committee yesterday unveiled a proposed fiscal 1981 state budget of $5.9 billion that calls for a major overhaul of the way state colleges operate . The surprise plan for a higher education reorganization is the budget ' s major difference from Gov . Edward J. King ' s state spending blueprint , which the committee received in January . The governor ' s proposed budget was for $5.886 billion , only $14 million lower than the committee ' s . Both budgets are about $300 million or about 5.6 percent higher than current state spending . The House is expected to begin debating the budget next week . Describing the committee ' s higher education proposal as " long overdue , " the committee ' s chairman , John J. Finnegan , said it was triggered primarily by a cutback in federal assistance to the commonwealth . The proposal , contained in a so-called " outside section " of the budget , calls for phasing out the board of regional community colleges , the board of state colleges , the executive office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oct. 1 . They would be replaced by a single board of public regents , on July 1 of next year . In addition , according to Finnegan , " virtually all the administration in all institutions of higher education in Massachusetts will be phased down or diminished as a result of this budget . " Finnegan said the combined steps could save the commonwealth ' s taxpayers $5 million in the fiscal year beginning July 1 and between $8 million and $9 million in fiscal 1982 . Noting that a legislative commission is reviewing the state ' s higher education system , Finnegan said , " We have accelerated the process because of the imminent loss of federal revenue sharing , which means that the taxpayers of the commonwealth will lose $36 million this year and $72.4 million next year and $72.4 million in the ensuing year . " Sen. Walter J. Boverini ( D-Lynn ) , chairman of the special commission on reorganization of higher education , said in a telephone interview yesterday that he thought the committee ' s action was " unwise . " " I sent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Senate president telling them I think it ' s unwise to allow the budget process to preempt the work of the commission . I feel we should wait for the commission ' s recommendations , " Boverini said . Finnegan himself said that the reorganization proposal was the document ' s most potentially controversial item , " the tough nut . " In presenting the committee ' s $5.9 billion budget version , Finnegan warned that if the Legislature decides on even higher state spending , it would almost certainly result in a state tax increase next year . " We are attempting to take ( cost-cutting ) steps now in this budget , and it ' s important that all of us understand the impetus for those steps is to avoid the possibility of a major tax increase next year . Whether we succeed or not remains to be seen , but it would be a sad day for us if we didn ' t try . " Other provisions of the proposed budget include : BULLET A freeze on state employment at the current level of about 66,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ King placed a similar hold on state hiring . " This will back that up , " said Finnegan . BULLET A 5-percent cost-of-living benefit increase for recipients of Aid to Families with Dependent Children and General Relief . BULLET A 6 percent increase in pension payments to retired state employees . BULLET Increases in various state fees , including a doubling of the current automobile driver ' s license fee from $10 to $20 . BULLET Creation of trusts where the assets of mentally retarded persons under the care of the Department of Mental Health can be placed . The purpose of such trusts is to make the retarded persons eligible for federal assistance , thus reducing state costs for their care . Finnegan noted that the King administration already has submitted legislation for fee increases and the trusts , but the committee decided to include these measures in the budget ' s outside sections also . The committee chairman said an estimated $13.5 million in federal funds would be generated by the trust creation and $10 million more in state funds by the increases in license fee . Finnegan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of several state hospitals , the committee ' s budget recommends that only Boston State Hospital be closed . " In point of fact , within the next few weeks there will be fewer than 50 patients at the hospital . And when we consider this year alone , with about 150 or 160 patients , we are spending in excess of $3 million to heat that plantbecause of the archaic nature of it - if you heat one building , you heat them all . It obviously is foolhardy and foolish fiscal practice to heat an entire campus of buildings in order to take care of 50 or 60 patients , " said Finnegan . Commenting on prospective collective bargaining agreements with state employees , Finnegan noted that the governor ' s budget proposal did not include provision for the cost of new wage contracts . " The ( committee ) budget includes a $30 million reserve to meet collective bargaining costs , " said Finnegan . The Alliance of state employees recently agreed to a contract that provides a $30 million wage and benefit package , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ union . After the House takes up the budget , it must go to the Senate Ways and Means Committee and the full Senate for action before being submitted to the governor . In recent years , the budget process has continued on past the beginning of the fiscal year on July 1 . B08025297
