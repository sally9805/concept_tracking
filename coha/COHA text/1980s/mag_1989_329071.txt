Some summer jobs are just a way to earn money . But for 23 college students who are willing to brave the heat of New York City , it 's also a chance to learn firsthand how we produce our magazines . Eighteen of our interns have spent the summer at SPORTS ILLUSTRATED , PEOPLE and other publications . Here at TIME , five labor right alongside their professional counterparts in different departments . Last month , as a reporter-researcher in the Nation section , Stanford senior Frank Quaratiello interviewed a survivor of the United Airlines DC-10 crash in Sioux City , Iowa , and is writing the Milestones section for this issue . Karla Bruner , a University of Missouri at Columbia graduate , has researched stories ranging from Cuba and Argentina to Burma and Greece for our World section . As managing editor of the Harvard International Review , Mark Suzman has come in contact with public figures like Jacques Delors , president of the European Commission .

In our New York bureau , David Muhlbaum of Middlebury College handles reporting on subjects as varied as the prospects for economic stability in Argentina and the consequences of posing for Playboy . <P> What do our summer staffers make of the TIME experience ?
