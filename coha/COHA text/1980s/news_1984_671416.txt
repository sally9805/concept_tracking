The Federal Communications Commission and other policy planners in the Administration and Congress still appear wedded to freeing the telephone industry from as much regulation as possible . But the effort to move from a reliance on government regulation to allowing supply and demand to shape what telecommunications service is offered - and at what price - has , in practice , raised many obstacles. // " The policy making has not been murky , " said Mark S. Fowler , the F.C.C. chairman . " We have a philosophical approach . Implementation and mechanics are quite murky. " // Most of the conflict revolves around one question : Is the move toward charging for telephone services what it actually costs to provide them - whether a long-distance call or a house call by a repairman - compatible with the Congressional mandate that basic telephone service be affordable for everyone ? <> <> Sharp Differences // Business and non-business telephone users differ sharply on deregulation , and so do state and Federal regulators . Depending upon the specific question , there is even disagreement among the numerous long-distance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The conflict is made worse by confusion over who is requiring what . Some changes are the work of the F.C.C. , which has moved vigorously toward deregulation . At the same time , the court-ordered breakup of the Bell System has entailed a basic restructuring of the industry . It has also meant that Judge Harold H. Greene , the Federal judge who presided over the antitrust suit against Bell , and the Justice Department have assumed an important regulatory role. // An example of " murky " implementation , Mr. Fowler said , was the unexpected two-year battle the commission waged with a variety of interests after it had decided to impose a monthly surcharge on residential telephone and single-line bills. // The F.C.C. had decided that local subscribers should carry more of the cost that local telephone companies collect for equipment used in completing local and long-distance calls. // Last week , the F.C.C. ruled that beginning June 1 , residences and single-line businesses would have to pay $1 a month in " access charges . " Though the telephone companies hailed the measure , pressure from consumer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to delay the new charge by a year , and reduce it by half . <> <> ' Everybody Knew ' // " Everybody knew what the right answer was , " Mr. Fowler said , asserting that there was no disagreement among Federal regulators over the need to restructure rates . " The question was how to do it . " Referring to the numerous trade-offs made by the commission , the telephone industry and legislators , he added : " That involved politics in the best sense. " // Noted A. Gray Collins Jr. , vice president for Federal regulatory matters at Bell Atlantic , one of the regional holding companies created by the breakup of the Bell System : " The F.C.C. , Congress and everybody else who wants to change the rules has to be concerned about how fast the rules change . It ' s a matter of the agendas meshing over the next year or so. " // State regulators , who have taken sharp issue with their Federal counterparts , are also wrestling with difficult questions. // They are pondering how much competition to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They also face the thorny issue of imposing access charges on companies offering intrastate long-distance service . Some are also addressing novel policy questions , such as whether to attempt to regulate the sale of office buildings constructed with sophisticated communications equipment - equipment occupants can use as an alternative to the local telephone company. // " We still seem to be a long , long way from any feeling that we ' re going to have general deregulation , " said Edward B. Hipp , a member of the North Carolina Utilities Commission and chairman of the communications utilities committee of the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners . " Deregulation and competition were a Federal program , " he said . " None of the states originated it . " He said the new era should be approached with caution in light of the impact on local customer bills . <> <> Tough Scrutiny Seen // Many of those interviewed said that the long and heated debate over the access charges was a sign that the free- market approach would undergo increasingly tough scrutiny . Concern is mounting over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for basic service . Consumers are seeing their bills go up. // In addition , some experts say , the hurdles posed by the consent decree could also affect the pace and direction of deregulation. // " We hope the new world is going to continue the trend toward more competition , " said David J. Markey , administrator of the National Telecommunications and Information Administration , the small agency that develops communications policy for the executive branch of the Government . " But when I look around , there ' s still a lot of government regulation : state commissions , the F.C.C. , Judge Greene and the Justice Department. " // It is generally agreed that the changes in prices and service that have followed divestiture are far less popular with the public than were the deregulation moves of the 1970 ' s. // " Deregulation has been complicated by the divestitutre , and people ' s frustrations are going to build as rates go up , " said Samuel Simon , executive director of the Washington- based Telecommunications Research and Action Center , a consumer advocacy group. // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upheaval , " Mr. Simon said . " Really fundamental questions are going to be asked now about regulation and telecommunications . " He offered , as an example , consumer groups ' feelings that the industry and Federal Government need more data based on actual experience to justify continued rate restructuring that shifts costs to nonbusiness users . <> <> Some Popular Choices // When the F.C.C. gave consumers the choice of buying their telephone equipment , or continuing to lease it from the local phone company , the action was popular , they said . So was the introduction , through deregulation , of competition in the long-distance business , a move that allowed customers to shop for lower rates. // Far less popular , however , has been the " unbundling " of certain costs - that is , the billing for them separately - and repricing of services . The former , which was proceeding at a snail ' s pace before the breakup of the Bell System , involves separate charges for numerous services , such as a call to information , telephone wire installation and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ costs from long-distance companies to local customers , or vice versa , in such items as the scheduled monthly access charge. // " These things consumers are finding far less palatable , " Mr. Simon said. // Unlike telephone equipment and long distance deregulation , the unbundling and repricing goals are viewed as benefiting big institutional users of the telephone network at the expense of basic subscribers. // The advocates of greater competition in telecommunications do not deny this . To the contrary , they respond that unless basic phone charges are increased , larger institutional users of local and long-distance services will install their own systems that bypass the local phone network . This would cause rates to be raised on remaining customers to maintain the network. // " Telephone industry pricing policies , not competition or the breakup itself , threaten universal service , " said Gene Kimmelman , legislative director of the Consumer Federation of America . <> <> A Gloomy Study // Earlier this month , the organization released a study predicting that between June 1984 and June 1985 , a million or more telephone subscribers will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ costs . The study was based on an economic model used by the seven Bell operating companies to project the impact of rate changes. // Early next year , the F.C.C. is expected to re-examine its so-called Computer II decision that allows the American Telephone and Telegraph Company , and the now independent Bell companies , to sell and service telephone equipment through separate units that can not market in conjunction with the phone companies. // At issue is whether the separate subsidiary rules should be changed or modified in order to allow the phone companies to better compete with others who sell the same kind of equipment , now that A.T. &; T. no longer controls access to most of the local telephone network . In this case , the commission may also decide to expand the variety of equipment the companies may sell , to reflect improvements in equipment available to institutional users from such companies as the International Business Machines Corporation. // In a case with a far-reaching impact on rates for all subscribers , the commission is also expected to decide next year whether the present rate-of- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the breakup of the Bell System . Prior to divestiture , the commission set a rate of return for A.T. &; T. that became the rule for the rest of the industry. // Today , however , it is being asked to set separate rates for A.T. &; T. , the seven Bell operating companies and many independent phone companies . <> <> Intelsat Decision Due // Whether to allow competition in the international satellite communications business against the nonprofit Intelsat is also an issue the commission is expected to decide next year. // Among the important long-term questions facing the commission is how to regulate A.T. &; T. in what staff members call the present " transitional competitive environment " and beyond . No quick decision on this question is expected. // Under consideration , however , are the arguments by the nearly 400 competing long-distance companies , whose rates are not regulated by the F.C.C. , that removal of rate regulation for A.T. &; T. could quickly drive most of them out of business - and defeat the F.C.C. ' s own efforts to promote competition. // " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the relationship between the telephone industry and the Government , " said Mr. Fowler of the F.C.C. " Our policy making comes down to one question : Is there a compelling government interest for something to be regulated ? " //
