Jeff Van Note has hit many things during his National Football League career . But when this Atlanta center hit the big Four-Oh this year , he knew he ' d be considered an oddball because he ' s the oldest player in the league at 40 years of age . Football is a young man ' s game . Otherwise , why would fans pay attention so rapturously to the annual college draft ? They enjoy their veterans , but don ' t put up with their declining skills for long . There ' s new horizons to be tackled . Van Note admits to losing a little here and there in physical skills , but this year he lost the one thing he has always prided himself on-his starting job . Wayne Radloff , an All-American from Georgia , has replaced Van Note in his second year as a Falcon . " I get about 20 plays a game , " Van Note noted sadly . " I ' m a player they use now for insurance . It ' s so much different than in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , Van Note is planning to slide out gracefully . He hasn ' t considered a future outside the NFL . He has dabbled in the trucking business and family franchise that churns out frozen food containers , but he says he hasn ' t planned much in terms of a future life . " Maybe I ' m a bad example as far as that ' s concerned . But I ' ve never found anything I like as well as football , " he said . " I ' m not in love with the game . I wouldn ' t say that . But I like it . It has made me happy . " The lifestyle is conducive to my personality . I like to wear shorts and T-shirts , flip-flops and sweats . I ' m not a guy who can get into tuxedos . I ' m not a guy who likes some people who do wear tuxedos . For the most part , I like football players . " In fact , the Bears  --  Sunday ' s enemy  --  are filled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hamp and his wife Terry are good people . And Ming the Merciless , Steve McMichael . Jay Hilgenberg and Tom Thayer are good friends , too , " he said . " And I knew Gary Fencik when we ( the players ' union ) were trying to dump Ed Garvey . " Van Note is so friendly with these people he flew to Chicago to attend the NFC championship game against Los Angeles that the Bears won to go to the Super Bowl last season . And he saw as good a group of players as any he has seen in his long tenure . " One of the most talented assemblages that I ' d seen in a long time , " he said . " And the thing I liked was they weren ' t robots . I liked seeing the individualism on the Bears . " Van Note is often asked to reflect on the NFL since he has seen it in its rise to glory . He doesn ' t consider himself qualified for philosophizing , but after that disclaimer he gives it a shot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different , but I don ' t know if you ' d say it was better , " said the 11th-round draft choice from Kentucky in 1969 . " My wife and I do talk about it occasionally , and when we look back we figure life was better when we first started . " I mean , the money is better . ( Instead of $12 , 000 , he will earn $300 , 000 a year ) . But there ' s enormous pressures on players that we didn ' t have when I started in the league . That ' s made many people a lot different than the kind of people I met at first . " A lot of players can ' t handle the pressures . They come from a regimented college life and are suddenly thrown on their own , where everything isn ' t done for you . Some aren ' t prepared educationally or spiritually to meet the pressures  --  and problems erupt when they can ' t solve it by themselves . " Yeah , drugs are a part of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of messing up , too . College players , after being sheltered , are asked to fit into a team chemistry and a lot can ' t adjust to it . Too much has been done for them . They expect too much to still be done . " When I began , playing in the NFL was a six-month job . After the season you went home and got a job for the other six months . Now the team wants you working out at their facilities every week during the offseason and I believe it ' s too much when you consider playing four exhibition games as well . " I ' d like to see training camp time reduced and exhibition games brought down to two a year . Working out all offseason , it has become too long a time with camp and preseason games before you get to that point when everything counts . " While Van Note is on the subject of changes , he ' d also like Pete Rozelle to know that he should take the gloves off linemen . And , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listen to a guy who will play in his 241st Falcon game Sunday ? That is exceeded only by the 270 games Jim Marshall played with Minnesota . " I ' d like to see the removal of all the hands stuff , take off those boxing gloves , " he said . " That way , the hands wouldn ' t be to just hit people , which is what it is now with all the gear that ' s on the hands . The gear is used to punch people . " Van Note was put on the Falcon roster his rookie year , but coach Norm Van Brocklin sent him to play in Huntsville , Ala. , with a team composed of minor- league players to hone his techniques . The Falcon organization used Huntsville as a farm club . " I didn ' t like it , but I knew if I was going to play in the NFL I ' d have to bust my rump there , " he said . " There were 30 teams in this league . We ' d take parachute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on board and sit by the plane doors . They would throw all the jocks and socks on the floor , so if you didn ' t get there early you wouldn ' t get a jock . " Van Note persisted through all that and plans to stick it out in the NFL as long as he can . Physically , he ' s in good shape . " It does take me longer to recover after a game . It ' s now Friday or Thursday before I feel loose enough to practice , where before the body was ready to go after one day of rest , " he said . " I like the fact I ' m still alive . But when people compliment you now by saying you are old but persistent , I don ' t really consider it the greatest compliment I ' ve ever had . If I was starting , it make me look more kindly on these kind of compliments . I have still got some starting left in me. "          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
