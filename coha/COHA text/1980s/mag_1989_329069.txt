" Hostile surveillance " is a technique used by police to pressure a suspect by letting him know he is being watched . The FBI 's investigation of Felix Bloch , the American diplomat suspected of espionage , by last week had mushroomed beyond hostility into full-blown hysteria . When Bloch and his daughter drove from suburban Chappaqua , N.Y. , into Manhattan , they were followed by a posse of federal officers , news reporters , camera crews and , said Government sources , a carload of KGB agents . <P> Within days , Bloch became the most intensely hounded public official since Oliver North . Justice Department sources whispered that the Austrian-born Bloch was not only a Communist spy but also an Austrian lackey : as deputy chief of the American mission in Vienna , he had argued against barring Austrian President Kurt Waldheim from the U.S. A Viennese newspaper chimed in that Bloch was also a skirt chaser : police in Vienna interviewed a call girl with whom he had had a " friendship " for several years . In New York City Ronald Lauder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Republican candidate for mayor , claimed he had so distrusted Bloch that he had him fired . Lauder backed down when the State Department pointed out that Bloch was reassigned to Washington in a normal rotation of duties . <P> Even George Bush got into the act , telling reporters that the case against Bloch was a " very serious matter . " That was as far as the Government was willing to go on an official level . The State Department confirmed that Bloch is being investigated for a " compromise of security which has occurred , " but at week 's end no charges had been filed against him , and he remained on paid leave from the department at an estimated $80,000 annual salary . Austrian officials confirmed that they were investigating a " phony Finn " who had traveled to Vienna several times on a forged passport . U.S. officials have fingered him as Bloch 's contact . <P> As investigators and reporters jostled for scraps of information about yet another apparent traitor , did anyone care that under the law Bloch was still presumed innocent ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spy scandal to come out of the State Department since the Alger Hiss affair . But , wrote columnist Lars-Erik Nelson of the New York Daily News , Bloch " is also a U.S. citizen , entitled to due process before execution . " Charles Schmitz , vice president of the American Foreign Service Association , said the baying after Bloch was " terrible either way  --  for his rights if innocent , for the case if guilty . " <P> When news of the scandal broke , much of the case against Bloch still consisted of statements from intelligence sources and evidence gathered by methods that might not even be admissible at a trial . Under U.S. law , direct evidence is required of the transfer to foreigners of damaging secret information . Sources claim that Bloch , 54 , a 30-year State Department veteran , was photographed passing a briefcase to a known Soviet agent in Paris . Reportedly , the same agent later tipped Bloch off to the investigation : " A bad virus is going around , and we believe you are now infected . "  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
