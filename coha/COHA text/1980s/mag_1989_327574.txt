Each year U.S. businesses lose as much as $40 billion to employees who steal . To protect their profit margins , many hard-hit companies have resorted to routine polygraph screening of workers and job applicants . But the scientific validity of these devices has never been proved , and the tests have sometimes caused harm to people who are falsely implicated . Such is the case of Shama Holleman , a college student who took a job in 1987 as a part-time cashier for Alexander 's department-store chain in New York City . After a month as a model employee , she was fired because a polygraph test indicated that she might be a drug dealer and might have served a prison sentence . Neither was true . Holleman sued Alexander 's , and they reached an out-of-court settlement . <P> In response to incidents like this , Congress has banned employers ' use of polygraph tests , voice-stress analysis and other electronic methods to screen current or prospective workers . The law , which went into effect Dec. 27 , exempts government agencies and such workers as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> The prohibition is a huge setback for the polygraph industry , which is expected to lose about 85% of its $100 million in annual revenues . But the new law is a boon for firms that offer two other character tests : pencil-and-paper quizzes and graphology , or handwriting analysis . Says Eric Zorn , senior vice president of the Jamesway discount-store chain : " I 'm very unhappy about the new law , but I 'm thankful we can still use written tests . " <P> The honesty exams , which were given to 3.5 million job applicants last year at a cost of $5 to $15 each , can be surprisingly straightforward . A questionnaire published by Reid Psychological Systems of Chicago asks test takers to mark whether or not they recently " overcharged a customer for personal gain " or " took something from a store without paying for it . " Many job applicants freely reveal their transgressions . " People put things on written tests they would n't tell their mothers , " says Larry Audler , vice president of personnel for the New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surveys usually include a few ringers ( example : " Do you always tell the truth ? " ) to determine whether a job seeker is being candid . No single answer brands a person as a liar or thief , but those who administer the test watch for ominous patterns . Observes Arthur Le Blanc , a California psychologist who helped screen new employees hired for the 1984 Olympic Games in Los Angeles : " If you score in a certain range , you 're more likely to be dishonest . " <P> For $100 to $500 per employee , handwriting analysts will assess at least 20 different cursive characteristics and advise the prospective employer about the chances of a person 's being a future embezzler or goldbrick . Ruth Brayer , president of Graphological Services International of New York , sees signs of dishonesty in illegible handwriting and retraced lines . Brayer , who counts Citibank among her clients , also hears warning bells " when a signature looks different from the rest of a person 's handwriting . "          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
