Q. In 1988 you sat in the cockpit of an American B-1 bomber , and this summer Admiral William Crowe ( ( the recently retired Chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff ) ) was on a Soviet nuclear submarine . Five years ago , that would have been unthinkable . Are you astonished at what has happened in such a short time ? <P> A. I would n't say so . In 1986 the Soviet Union outlined and defined the main principles of its foreign policy : demilitarization , the absence of force in relations between states , and democratization . Ideology should not influence an improvement or a worsening in relations between states . We started to put these principles into practice . This was noticed in the U.S. Americans are pragmatic . They never believe words , only deeds . <P> Q. The West has responded coolly to President Gorbachev 's Oct. 26 proposal in Finland to remove nuclear-armed submarines from the Baltic Sea . Are you worried about making too many unilateral concessions and not getting enough in return ? <P> A. Someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When the U.S. rejected negotiations on naval forces , the Soviet Union made a big concession and said it was willing to wait and hold negotiations on strategic weapons and armed forces in Europe . Little is said about this nowadays , but it gave a major impetus to the negotiations . If you consider this to be a concession , it was , but if it were not for this concession we would still be marching in place . <P> But this does n't imply that the Soviet Union has dropped the idea of negotiations about naval forces . Today we say that the time has come . Maybe not tomorrow but , within a month , three months or half a year 's time , we should begin . It was no coincidence that President Gorbachev raised that issue ( ( in Finland ) ) . The world press has not mentioned this . There has been no reaction . <P> Q. Perhaps we missed the signal ? <P> A. No , there are people in the U.S. who ought to know and do know . Many hours of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Quite recently the U.S. Chief of Naval Operations , Admiral Carlisle Trost said that everything should be done to keep the naval problem secondary . He does n't want these negotiations , and he is not the only one . As for other concessions , they were made on both sides . If someone believes that we are eliminating more intermediate-range missiles than the U.S. and that this is a defeat for the Soviet Union , let them . We do not consider that we have lost anything from the point of view of security . We have no intention of riding side by side , as in a horse race . If we see goodwill on our partner 's side , we take this into consideration , but we believe that we are doing a lot , not less than the U.S. , to guarantee the success of negotiations . <P> Q. Do you see a time when there will be no Warsaw Pact and no NATO ? <P> A. We and our allies are ready to sit down today and negotiate the simultaneous disbanding at least of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some destabilization , because the world has been structured on the basis of these two blocs , but we are ready . Your Secretary of Defense said in Portugal that it should n't be done , so it does n't depend on us . <P> Q. What about foreign bases ?
