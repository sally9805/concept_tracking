Sharon makes a political comeback , and terrorists strike again <P> As the fully loaded bus left Tel Aviv , Passenger Nissim Cohen became suspicious of four young Arabs aboard the vehicle , two at the front and two at the back . Cohen noticed that the men , who had two suitcases among them , appeared tense and never spoke to one another . He mentioned his fears to an army officer , but was urged to calm down . Finally , after the bus had passed Ashdod , 19 miles south of Tel Aviv , Cohen jumped off and called police . Moments later , the four men announced that they were armed with explosives and were taking over the bus . " We are at war , " said one . " Your people are killing our women and children . You are our prisoners , and we will kill you . " <P> The bus raced on toward the Egyptian border , smashing through two roadblocks before being brought to a halt by Israeli marksmen who shot out its tires . As helicopters flew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Defense Minister Moshe Arens and Chief of Staff Moshe Levy , the terrorists demanded the release of 25 Palestinians being held in Israeli jails . At 4:45 a.m . Friday , before the first rays of light hit the surrounding palm trees , Israeli commandos burst in through the rear window and two doors , killing all four hijackers . One passenger died , seven were injured and 31 escaped unhurt .

There , at a meeting of the central committee of the Herut Party , the main group within the ruling Likud bloc , former Defense Minister Ariel Sharon was challenging Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir for the party leadership . <P> Shamir won , as expected , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the July 23 elections . But the big surprise was that Sharon got 42% of the delegates ' votes to Shamir 's 56% . Most political observers had expected Sharon to win a mere 10% to 15% . It was a remarkable comeback for a man who was forced to resign as Defense Minister last year after the government-appointed Kahan commission concluded that he had made " a grave mistake when he ignored the danger of acts of revenge and bloodshed " by Lebanese Phalangists against Arab civilians in the Sabra and Shatila refugee camps outside Beirut in September 1982 . Might Sharon 's strong showing last week put him in a position to regain his old defense job ? " Not to be excluded , " boasted his close associate Uri Dan , who recalled that after publication of the Kahan report he had said , " Those who did n't want Sharon as Minister of Defense will get him as Prime Minister .
