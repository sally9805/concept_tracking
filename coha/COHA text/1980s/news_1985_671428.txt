" No , no ! " exclaimed Sonny Grosso . " Not like that ! " To demonstrate , Mr. Grosso sidled up to the car himself , his back to the door , his gaze fixed off in the distance , his hand hidden behind his back as he fumbled for the handle . He suddenly opened the car door and dived inside . " You see ? You don ' t walk straight up . You ' re doing anything but looking at that car ! " // Recalling the moment later , Mr. Sheen grinned . " I don ' t take a whole lot of liberties here , particularly when there ' s any professional business , " he said . " I don ' t know anything about cops , and these guys are all right here . They make it very clear . They say , ' This is why it ' s this way . This is why it ' s not the way you ' re doing it. ' " // As Mr. Sheen proceeds with the filming of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is finding he can not ignore such questions of authenticity , given the identity of some of his colleagues on the set. // <> <> Cops on the Set // Sonny Grosso , the film ' s producer , is a former New York policeman who with his partner , Eddie Egan , helped crack the drug running case later dramatized in the movie " The French Connection . " Eddie Zigo , the detective who is credited with cracking the Son of Sam case , is serving as a consultant to the current film , which is called " Zigo ' s Choice . " And as a final fillip , Mr. Egan is playing a police officer in " Zigo ' s Choice. " // The movie , which is scheduled to be broadcast on CBS sometime in April , is currently being shot on locations around the city . For the last few days , the scene has been a quiet , tree-lined street in Brooklyn where the arrival of a small army of technicians , actors and assorted crew , along with the trailers and equipment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other , was greeted with enthusiasm by neighborhood residents , many of whom regarded the filming as an all- day spectacle. // Quietly watching the goings-on was Mr. Zigo , the man on whose life the film is based . Given his constant presence on the set , all Mr. Sheen had to do was to glance off-camera to be reminded of the reality of his character . The character of Mr. Zigo is crucial , since all concerned with the project emphasize that the film is not about the actual Son of Sam killings , but about Mr. Zigo and the crisis the murders precipitated in his own life. // " This is the story of Eddie Zigo , his personal life , his family and the problems he went through , " Mr. Grosso said . " He was the first guy called upon to join the Son of Sam task force , but his wife was ill , and he had two kids , and even though he was dying to do it , he decided not to join the task force . To me , there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his family over his job , who has to relinquish the ultimate recognition . To give that up and know that maybe he ' ll never have the opportunity again is a choice a lot of guys don ' t make . The fact that he did that , and then he got the recognition later on anyway , was the thing that really moved me. " // <> <> A Real-Life Hero // It was also the reason Mr. Sheen decided to get involved in the project . " Eddie Zigo is a real-life hero , and I don ' t get an opportunity to play too many of those guys , " he said . " This guy stands for something . I want him to see a fair reflection of his life and his work , so very often I ' ll say to him , ' Eddie , how would you say this ? What did you mean ? ' Then it becomes clear , and I see it from the cop ' s point of view. " // Although he chose to concentrate on his family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was still the one to apprehend David R. Berkowitz , the . 44-caliber killer known as the Son of Sam who was sentenced to terms of more than 300 years after pleading guilty to killing six people and wounding seven in a 13-month period. // " It ' s a strange world , and a small world , " Mr. Grosso observed . " Of all the places Berkowitz could have killed somebody , that he went to Brooklyn - he had never been to Brooklyn before , but he killed that last person in Eddie Zigo ' s precinct . So Eddie got absorbed into the task force at the last stage , and he was the one who tracked down a ticket for double parking , went up to Yonkers , found Berkowitz ' s car and found machine guns , hundreds of rounds of ammunition and a letter in it that said he was going to a disco in the Hamptons with a machine gun and kill hundreds of people. " // For Mr. Zigo , the experience of watching the movie being made has proven disturbing at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and there are things I ' ve never divulged to members of my own family , " he said . " Now I not only have to tell my family , I have to tell the world . It ' s hard for me to adjust to , especially when they ' re portraying some of the police scenes . When they say , ' Detective Zigo , ' I immediately turn around and want to start running toward what ' s happening. " // Even more difficult are emotional scenes like those between Mr. Sheen and the actor who plays Mr. Zigo ' s best friend , a priest in whom he confided his fears about losing his wife , who later died. // " I was watching them , and after listening to the dialogue I just had to walk away , " Mr. Zigo said softly . " It brought back a lot of memories . I ' m always embarrassed that I tear up. " // <> <> Recently Retired // However , the movie has come at an opportune time for Mr. Zigo , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I didn ' t want to retire , " he said . " It killed me . I really loved it . " He smiled ruefully . " I always felt like I was that little kid playing at cops and robbers. " // Despite the fact that he has successfully established himself in show business since his own retirement in 1976 , Sonny Grosso feels the same way about his career as a police officer. // " I miss it more than anything , " he said . Looking around him at the scurrying technicians with their walkie- talkies , the actors rehearsing their lines and bits of business , the entranced spectators , he sighed // " Everything ' s fake here , " he said . " It ' s all make-believe . Everything ' s for real when you ' re a cop . The urgency and immediacy of doing police work - it ' s the best , most interesting , most exciting job in the world. " // For a brief moment , Mr. Grosso will resume that identity when he appears as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ police career , he worked as a narcotics detective , but he also specialized in hostage situations , so he knows what to do. // " I have no acting experience , " he said , " except 20 years on the job.
