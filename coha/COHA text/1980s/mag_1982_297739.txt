It is the worst of times for many savings and loans <P> The U.S. 's 3,800 federally insured savings and loan associations and the 449 mutual savings banks last week received another dose of bad news . The Federal Home Loan Bank Board reported that the net worth of S and Ls fell by $636 million in November , to $28 billion . That brought losses for the first eleven months of 1981 to $4.3 billion , which was more than in any year since the Great Depression . The new year does not promise to be much better . Says James Christian , chief economist of the U.S. League of Savings Association : " This will be another period of losses and accelerated mergers . " <P> The S and Ls and mutual savings banks , which have long been the backbone of America 's housing industry , have been caught in a profit squeeze caused by lending long at low interest rates and borrowing short at much higher ones . Al . though they were often earning 9% or less on 20- or 30-year mortgages that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paying customers 16% or more for new two- or three-year deposits . Making matters worse was the fact that as interest rates have risen during the past two years , many investors have pulled their cash out of thrift institutions and poured it into money-market funds or other places where they could get a greater return . In most months of 1981 , withdrawals exceeded deposits at S and Ls and mutual savings banks . <P> These problems have been too much for many thrifts . During 1981 a record 256 S and Ls and savings banks slid into mergers with other institutions . Last month , for example , the Harlem Savings Bank announced its union with the Central Savings Bank on the other side of Manhattan . The marriage had been arranged by federal banking authorities to save failing Central , which had a third-quarter operating loss of $8.3 million against a net worth of $17.7 million . To bring off the merger with Harlem , the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation took over a package of Central 's weak loans and assumed other responsibilities totaling $160 million . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just what the thrifts needed . But now that rates are falling , many S and Ls are not much better off . The declines are too small , come too late , and will probably not last long enough to help institutions already seriously endangered . Says David Levine , an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein &; Co. : " Rates have not dropped far enough to save the industry . " <P> The thrifts have not been helped much either by the new All Savers Certificates created by Congress last summer . The new savings instruments , which the industry had lobbied to have included in the Reagan Administration 's tax-cut package , were supposed to lure money to the S and Ls by allowing couples to earn up to $2,000 in tax-free interest . <P> Sales of the certificates started out well last October , when the return was a strong 12.6% , or the taxable equivalent of about 20% interest . But their appeal has waned in recent months as interest rates eased . The yield last week was as low as 8.3% , and deposits in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
