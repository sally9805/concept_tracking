RCA to Bendix : No Thanks <P> For more than a year , William Agee , chairman of Bendix Corp . ( 1981 sales : $4.4 billion ) has been shopping for a high-technology company to buy with Bendix 's $570 million cash trove . But when Bendix revealed last week that it had quietly acquired more than 5% of the stock of RCA Corp . ( 1981 sales : $8 billion ) , the ailing conglomerate reacted like a tough old dowager who had just been propositioned , cutting loose with the kind of language not normally used in corporate communications . <P> RCA , which reported an 83% drop in profits and slashed its dividend in half this month , suggested that Agee keep his hands to himself . In a press release , RCA harrumphed that the Bendix chairman " has not demonstrated the ability to manage his own affairs , let alone someone else 's . " The slam was an obvious reference to the close relationship between Agee , 44 , and Mary Cunningham , 30 , who became a Bendix vice president @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then resigned amid rumors that she and Agee were romantically linked . In another broadside , RCA Chairman Thornton Bradshaw noted that his firm is engaged in the delicate maneuver of deciding which businesses to sell and which to keep to become more profitable . Said he : " This is precisely not the time for us to permit anyone to attempt to meddle with or in any way destabilize the effort under way now . " <P> Bendix insisted all along that it planned to buy no more than 9.9% of RCA 's stock , and that the shares it now owns are for investment purposes only . At week 's end Bendix acknowledged holding 7.3% of RCA shares outstanding , worth about $106 million at current prices . The Michigan auto parts , aerospace and electronic equipment maker said it would stop there for at least 30 days , and would give 48 hours ' notice before buying more shares . <P> <P> Bendix 's unsuccessful courting of RCA had been going on for months . According to one source , Agee first approached Bradshaw last September with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his office . " Bendix has confirmed that Agee discussed an investment in RCA at the meeting . Last week , when Agee returned to reveal the Bendix purchase , Bradshaw reportedly told him that " there were going to be no punches pulled and that they RCA were going to drag in his personal life " if Agee persisted . Bradshaw himself has declined comment on the report . <P> <P> Analysts , meanwhile , noted several possible motives for the Bendix acquisition . Agee has repeatedly expressed an interest in acquiring a high-technology firm , and may have been attracted by RCA 's electronics and communications businesses , which make computer microchips , space satellites and other sophisticated equipment . On the other hand , Agee may simply have been intending all along to hold RCA stock in hopes of profiting from a future rise in price . In fact , no sooner did the word of Bendix 's investment hit Wall Street than RCA 's stock rose ? , to $20 a share . It closed the week by dropping to 19.      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
