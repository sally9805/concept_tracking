The Boston Celtics limped into the Eastern Conference final for the fourth straight year Sunday afternoon , another day older and deeper in oxygen debt . They outlasted the Milwaukee Bucks in a grueling seven-game semifinal series only because a champion 's heart beats beneath their bruised and groaning exterior . " I guess the old adage is true , " said Kevin McHale . " The most dangerous bear is a wounded bear . " // The Celts , vying to become ( as the NBA liturgy goes ) the first team to repeat since 1969 , beat the Bucks 119-113 in a rousing Game 7 at the Boston Garden to go into the conference final against Detroit . They won it , as they won so many others this season , with a mixture of guile and guts supplied by the best starting five in basketball and with scant but timely help from the bench . And they won it because Robert Parish has more raw courage than anyone ever gave him credit for and because Larry Bird can shoot free throws a little . // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 108-100 , and there seemed to be no way the Celtics could win . The mystique of Boston Garden ? Milwaukee had shattered that in Game 5 with a 129-124 victory . The legendary cool of Bird down the stretch ? In the second halves of Games 5 and 6 , both Celtic losses , he had shot a combined 4 of 20 from the field , and here he was once again , clanging jump shots he usually makes in his sleep . The wily Celtic backcourt of Dennis Johnson and Danny Ainge ? It was now a solo act , Ainge having been carried off to the dressing room in the third quarter with a sprained knee . Boston 's legendary reserve strength ? Puh-leeze . Milwaukee had a passel of clones at its disposal  --  tough , speedy , athletic  --  while Boston had what it has had all season , guys who did n't do much more than sit within reach of the Poland Spring watercooler. // Furthermore , Milwaukee was playing inspired ball , knowing that coach Don Nelson , currently embroiled in a feud with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fish tie on the Buck bench . // " Yes , it looked grim , " said Celtic assistant coach Jimmy Rodgers . " Maybe a little grimmer than usual . But you 've got to remember that we 've been in these situations so many times before . That 's when our experience , our character , takes over . That 's the x factor . " // And it proved to be X-rated for the Bucks . Over the next three minutes , Boston outscored Milwaukee 11 to 5 , to creep within a basket at 113-111 as the Garden noise level maxed out . With 2:32 left , the Bucks ' Paul Pressey , the best player in the game on this afternoon ( with 28 points , 8 assists and 4 steals ) , collected his sixth foul when he grabbed Bird , who was carving out offensive position on the right side . Nelson saw a bad moon rising . // " The biggest point of the game was losing Pressey , " Nelson said . Correct . The gangly Pressey was clearly Milwaukee 's only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cold , was going to take over this game in crunch time . // Though Bird 's marksmanship from the field was shaky throughout ( he finished 9-of-21 , but 13-of-13 from the line ) , he swished both free throws to tie the game . On Boston 's next possession , Bird posted up Ricky Pierce , drew the foul and buried two more for a 115-113 Boston lead . Then , with 1:31 left , he posted up Sidney Moncrief , spun away for a drive , drew a foul from Terry Cummings and drained two more free throws , just as if he were playing 21 back in French Lick . " Once I get to the line , " said Bird , " I 'm pretty comfortable . " // Sixteen seconds later , Parish and Dennis Johnson combined on a play that both iced the game and crystallized the Celtics ' intensity . Jack Sikma went up for a baseline shot and Parish jumped out at him . A badly sprained left ankle had kept the Chief out of Game 6 ( a 121-111 Milwaukee victory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You could hear him groaning all the time , " said Bucks ' guard John Lucas , " but he did n't get the name Chief for nothing . " Parish cleanly swatted away Sikma 's shot , his fourth block of the game . Out of nowhere came Johnson , who tapped the ball off Sikma 's leg while flying toward the Milwaukee bench . Celtics ' ball . " DJ keeps you in the game even when you 're out of the game , " said Pressey , who had ducked out of Johnson 's way . The ball landed in Bird 's hands . And DJ landed  --  if you like your symbolism rough and sweaty  --  in Nelson 's empty seat . Game , set and match , Boston . // The Bucks had done all they could , but in the end they were worn down by the worn-down . In the final 5:23 , they scored but three points , all free throws , missing all nine of their shots from the floor ; they were shut out in the last 3:30 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boards ) , blocked four more shots ( 8-4 ) and drilled five more free throws , including the six in a row that Bird made down the stretch , none of which touched anything but net . // But it was Johnson who may well have been the most important Celtic warrior , for it was he who handled the ball almost exclusively against the Milwaukee pressure in the final 16 minutes . Ainge 's injury came as no surprise to the Celtics , who have seen the guardian angel that protected them from infirmity last season transmogrified into a snarling sadist . Only Bird and DJ have escaped the sadist 's prod , which has touched McHale , Parish and now Ainge in the playoffs and Bill Walton throughout the season . And as far as the Celtic bench goes , rarely have so many contributed so little to so much . // By contrast , along last year 's championship road , coach K.C. Jones frequently used the Green Team , Boston 's name for its reserves , as a unit , playing either Bird or McHale with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rick Carlisle . So why is this year 's Green Team a Rarely Seen Team ? " I think that should be obvious , " says Jones . " Look around . " By around , he meant the mobile hospital ward that includes Walton and Wedman . Walton , who underwent arthroscopic surgery on his right ankle on Dec. 17 , played in only 10 regular-season games , and Wedman played only 78 minutes  --  his career is in jeopardy due to repeated problems with his heel . " It 's not crazy to think that , at age 34 , it might be over , " he says . Carlisle , uninjured , is currently on the outside looking in , a 13th man , cast off in favor of rookie Conner Henry . // There are those , however , who say Jones should have given players like Jerry Sichting , Fred Roberts and Darren Daye more playing time to prepare for playoff pressure . Jones , normally as unflappable as General Secord , is tired of hearing that argument . " We 've made the best of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's defense , the factor that made last year 's Green Team mean was Walton , whose enthusiasm , rebounding , passing and defense were usually strong enough to overcome any deficiencies of the unit as a whole . " Not having experienced players like Bill and Scotty makes all the difference in the world , " said Sichting . " It 's much harder for the young players to adjust in limited playing time . " // Indeed it has been . What does it mean when a coach has no confidence in his bench ? It means that when Parish went down in a heap and came up limping , as he did late in Game 5 , Jones did n't even pull him out to take a look at him . It means that , during a 14-3 run in the first six minutes of the fourth period that turned Game 6 in Milwaukee 's favor , Jones made nary a momentum-stopping substitution . ( A few times he looked longingly down his bench hoping , perhaps , to spot John Havlicek but seeing only Greg Kite ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sam Vincent . ) It means that , as a unit , the bench is almost a nullity in the statistics columns . Though McHale , Parish and Ainge all missed significant playing time , Boston starters still got 80% of the total minutes , with 89% of the points , 84% of the rebounds and 85% of the assists in the seven games against Milwaukee . Those numbers were reminiscent of another team that reached the Eastern Finals almost entirely on the backs of a Fab Five  --  the 1969 New York Knicks , who went almost exclusively with a lineup of Willis Reed , Walt Frazier , Dave DeBusschere , Dick Barnett and Bill Bradley . // Herewith a capsule portrait of the Celtics ' Sit-down Seven : // Bill Walton , center : The redhead played 76 minutes in five playoff games before reinjuring his right ankle in Game 2 of the Milwaukee series . He was back in Game 7 , but played only one minute in the second quarter . His prospects for playing against Detroit ? " I still have a lot of pain when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ definite no ? " No , but it does n't look real good . " // Fred Roberts , forward : The versatile Mister Roberts did a creditable job this season , considering that his minutes came in a wildly oscillating pattern . " It 's almost like you 're not part of the team sometimes , " said Roberts , who is known as Norm because his unusual appearance  --  angular face , short hair and perpetual five o'clock shadow  --  suggested , to one Celtic , Tony Perkins 's Norman Bates character in Psycho. // Jerry Sichting , guard : Ralph Sampson 's 1986 playoff sparring partner averaged 20 minutes per game during the season , about the same as last year when his straight-as-a-string jumper and adhesive defense contributed to the Celtic championship . But he has played sparingly in the playoffs ( 12 minutes per game ) and , until he hit two key jumpers in the fourth quarter on Sunday , not very well ( 22 points on 10-of-26 shooting ) . More than anyone , Sichting misses Walton , who would draw the defense in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to find Jerry , and that 's what Bill did , " says Bird . Sichting is still the first guard off the Celtic bench , but that does n't mean as much as it used to . // Darren Daye , forward : It was Daye , plucked from the waiver wire in December , who gave the Green Team its finest playoff moment when he hit a jumper and two free throws down the stretch in Boston 's 138-137 double-OT victory against the Bucks in Game 4 . Like Roberts , Daye is a versatile player who , at times , can defend , shoot , pass , rebound and run the floor . But not at all times . // Greg Kite , center : Injuries to the front line have forced Kite onto active standby . In 45 playoff minutes , however , he has scored only three points and committed 10 personal fouls . During one sad stretch in January , he made only one of 17 free throws . Veteran Boston Globe writer Bob Ryan called Kite " the least talented player in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cited him as the most boring athlete in Boston . But his lowest point of the season came when a stat sheet in Indiana listed him as Tom Kite . " I hit eight fairways and 10 greens in regulation , " said Kite . // Sam Vincent , guard : He 's the Green Team mystery man , a talented offensive player who was Boston 's first-round pick in the 1985 draft . But he has never gotten untracked , partly because he is mistake-prone and partly because he has n't had the minutes to really strut his stuff . " Most teams have some sort of substitution pattern , but we seem to have absolutely none , " says Vincent . He has played only 16 postseason minutes in six games . // Conner Henry , guard : Opinion is divided in Celtic Land about who is the more valuable asset , Henry , a 6 ' 7 " point guard with off-guard shooting skills , or Carlisle , a less gifted player who rarely makes a mistake . But it 's not exactly a red-hot issue  --  Henry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Celtics could have used more help from the Green Team , especially with the cocky and well-rested Pistons waiting in the wings . Just as surely , the Celtic starters were tired of answering questions about being tired  --  particularly Bird , who said things like , " I get paid to play 48 minutes " and " I could play two games a day . " Asked about his feelings when Ainge went down in the third quarter , Bird said : " My feeling was , let 's get him off the court so we can get on with the game . " // But that was the man 's pride and arrogance talking . The reality was something else . In their protracted battle with Milwaukee , during which they blew a 3-1 series lead , the Celtics saw glimpses  --  if not a giant mural  --  of their own limitations . But they obviously had those other things going for them , the experience , the mental toughness , the character . Look at Bird 's face at the free throw line in clutch situations . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rebounds , as he did on Sunday . Look at DJ sail headlong into the courtside seats . You 're looking at the x factor . // And at a team unwilling to become ex-champions.
