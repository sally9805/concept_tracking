It was a cameo , a gem of political theatrics last week in the Rose Garden burnished by sunshine and the lovely memory of every American 's uncle , the late Democratic Senator Henry ( " Scoop " ) Jackson . It was too tiny a melody for the tin ears of the networks . And yet , those few moments foreshadowed the very bugle call of Ronald Reagan 's campaign to reclaim the Oval Office . <P> If Reagan has genius it was displayed in this posthumous presentation of the Medal of Freedom to Scoop . If Reagan does glide through to victory , it will be because of his singular instincts about how to play President . He melds great national principles with private ambitions ; he blends what is real with what is ephemeral . Emotion becomes meaning . Politics becomes sacred policy . Adversaries become allies . <P> Reagan unabashedly used Scoop , but did so in a way that honored his memory , his family and his country . The President threw out his big arms and gathered everybody in-Democrat , Republican , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young , hawk , dove , hardhat , tycoon . And none of them could argue , only lean back and enjoy the political theater that Reagan had adroitly and effortlessly stage-managed . <P> Reagan stood the memory of Scoop beside him on the world 's stage ( " one of the great Senators in our history " ) , and the two of them ( " Let others push each chic new belief ... " ) marched as defenders of " the permanent against the merely prevalent . " <P> Swallows swooped in the bright sky . " Henry Jackson knew that America could not and must not attempt to float along alone , a blissful island of democracy in a sea of totalitarianism , " said Reagan . Take note , voters , that the Democrats have just drafted a platform that has strong withdrawal symptoms . " And it was very much like Scoop to see that there was a growing problem in Central America , " declared Reagan . Think again , you doubting souls who voted last week to end CIA help for Nicaraguan contras . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ national security , the best politics is no politics , ' " the President continued . Come on , all you partisans ; get behind the Reagan foreign policy . " I am deeply proud to have Jackson Democrats serve in my Administration , " Reagan said . " I am proud that some of them have found a home here . " The message that came through loud and clear : Those of you Democrats listening are even more welcome on Nov. 6 . <P> The Washington Monument stood white above the deep summer green of the trees . Reagan squinted and smiled and soothed . " Scoop believed in arms control , but he refused to support any initiative that would not ensure the survival of the West . " Remember that , fellow citizens , when you hear cries from the timid to rush to the table with the Soviets . " Scoop never stopped speaking out against anti-Semitism in the Soviet Union , " said Reagan . " And he was never afraid to speak out against anti-Semitism at home . Scoop Jackson just would not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anguish over Jesse Jackson and his supporter Louis Farrakhan , who said that " the present state called Israel is an outlaw act .
