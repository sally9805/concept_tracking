Peoria 's pick <P> Ever since he first went to Congress 26 years ago , Republican Congressman Robert Michel has played well in Peoria , the largest town in his 18th Congressional District in central Illinois . Now Peoria seems to be having its doubts . Long a pocket of prosperity in America 's heartland , the region is reeling from depressed farm prices and 16% unemployment . The Pabst brewery and the Hiram Walker distillery have left town , and giant Caterpillar Tractor alone has laid off 8,000 workers . So Michel , 59 , the House minority leader and President Reagan 's high-profile point man on Capitol Hill , is in an unexpectedly tight race with a relative unknown , Democrat G. Douglas Stephens . Michel has paraded through town on an elephant , courted Kiwanis and even imported Hollywood stars . " He 's not running scared , " says an aide , " but he sure is running harder than ever before . " <P> Small wonder . Michel is widely blamed in his home town for failing to change Reagan 's mind about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decision cost Caterpillar an $85 million contract for pipelaying equipment and shifted future contracts to its leading rival , Japan 's Komatsu . Michel later broke publicly with the President on this issue , but he has not otherwise sought to distance himself from the Administration . Says Michel : " Ronald Reagan is not a problem for me or for the country . " <P> Stephens , 31 , a lawyer with ties to organized labor , claims that Michel 's responsibilities as a G.O.P. leader put him at odds with his factory and farm constituency . He also criticizes Michel 's heavy contributions from political action committees that " read like the FORTUNE 500 list . " Stephens , trying to overcome low name recognition , has raised about $120,000 so far , to Michel 's $490,000 . The House Republican leader ranks first in Illinois and third nationally among House candidates in PAC contributions . <P> Despite a redistricting move last year by the state legislature that increased the district 's potential Democratic vote from 38% to 46% , Michel is still the favorite . He argues that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the source of some political trouble for him now , will prove an advantage to his constituency in the long run , especially when the recession ends . He says he is " tickled to death " about Reagan 's scheduled appearance this week at a campaign gala at the Peoria Civic Center , also featuring Charlton Heston and Pat Boone . Scoffed an aide to Stephens , on whose behalf such Democrats as Walter Mondale and John Glenn have made campaign appearances : " They must be running scared if they have to bring in the Gipper , Moses and Mr. Clean all together . " But while Michel is not expected to carry home town Peoria , businessmen and farmers elsewhere in the district should provide enough votes to make him a 14-term Congressman . <P> Scout 's honor
