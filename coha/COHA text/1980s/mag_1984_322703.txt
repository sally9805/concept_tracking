Jackson 's Bid <P> To the Editors : <P> Granted , Jesse Jackson 's candidacy NATION , May 7 is rooted in the black political conscience , but his message is the most far-reaching and freshest presented by a Democratic candidate . Jackson cuts across traditional lines of race , class and even party . We may be witnessing the most significant political event since Franklin Roosevelt took office in 1933 . <P> Robert and Ricardo del Valle <P> Birmingham , Mich . <P> Everyone is condemning Louis Farrakhan for his remarks about Reporter Milton Coleman . Blacks are fed up with Uncle Toms who run back to Ole Massa repeating what is said among blacks . When the Knights of Columbus or B'nai B'rith have a meeting , their members do not tattle to blacks . <P> Jack Tuff <P> New York City <P> If there is a Republican victory this fall , the Democratic Party leaders will blame Jesse Jackson . Jackson will also be accused if Jews and others leave the Democratic ranks . If Jesse Jackson becomes the scapegoat because he has spoken out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Party . <P> Denise Hartsfield <P> Washington , D.C. <P> <P> Why ca n't people , both black and white , accept the fact that a black candidate can be successful ? The era of blacks ' taking a back seat and automatically supporting white politicians is over . Jackson 's campaign is an introduction to a future of true equality . <P> Charlene I. Berry <P> Glendale , Calif . <P> <P> I resent your implication that Jews constitute a bloc vote or can be " delivered . " I am white and Jewish , and I make up my own mind . I admire what Jesse Jackson is doing for his race and for the American political process . He is enunciating things that need to be said and advocating changes that are past due . <P> Leo E. Heymann <P> New Orleans <P> Jesse Jackson is an inspiration to black people . Unfortunately , many blacks are oblivious to Jackson 's naive view of Muammar Gaddafi , Fidel Castro , Nicaragua 's Sandinistas and the Soviets . I am black , but I would not give Jackson my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imprudent . <P> Clifford Wilson <P> Los Angeles <P> I do not think the blacks are so downtrodden when the mayors of six of our major cities are black . <P> Evelyn Lane <P> Canoga Park , Calif . <P> <P> The quotes of mine saying Jesse Jackson " has no real program " and " does n't know what he is doing " refer to Jackson 's campaign for the 1984 Democratic presidential nomination . Of course Jackson has a policy , a specific policy on many issues , but it is not a policy calculated to win him the nomination . Jackson also knows what he is doing as a national leader , but what he is doing is not advancing his chances to be the Democratic candidate . His policies and his campaign are not going to get him nominated . If my quotes have been interpreted as general rather than specific commentaries on Jackson 's chances of being the Democratic candidate in 1984 , that was not my intention . <P> <P> Richard M.
