THE TALK OF THE TOWN Notes and Comment WE have heard once more from our scientifically oriented friend . This is what he had to say : You remember the last time I wrote to you I had just begun working on Ruhik 's Cube and had bought a UFO Solar Saucer that goes around and around when the sun shines on it . Well , before I tell you what I have been up to recently let me tell you what happened about the cube . When I was working on it , I got a T-shirt with a magnificent decal showing the cube and saying , " I beat the cube . " I had n't beaten the cube , but it was good for my morale . Anyway , I was wearing this thing to the dentist  --  I was going jogging in it afterward  --  and riding up to his office in the elevator . There was a United Parcel deliveryman in the elevator , and he caught sight of the shirt and asked if I was in the contest  --  the cube contest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and , out of politeness , I asked if he was in the contest . " I did n't enter , " he said . " My time is too slow . It takes me over a minute to do it . " When I got home , I put my cube in a. drawer , and I have n't looked at it since . The Solar Saucer still goes around , but it set off a train of thought that is really what I am writing to you about . One afternoon , as I was watching it , it occurred to me that I really did n't understand it . Sure , I know as well as the next man that photons from the sun produce an electric current in the photo cell and that this current drives the motor . But so what ? How would you build one ? If I could only build one , I thought , I could really get to see its heart and soul . This simple idea set off a whole chain reaction , because , as I looked around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much of anything . I had just bought one of those electronic watches that chime every hour . I love it dearly and find its little hourly statement a testimonial  --  a reassuring one  --  to the continuity of things , but I do not have the foggiest idea of how it works . I certainly do n't understand how my color television set works . In fact , I barely understand how my manual typewriter works . For a moment , I felt like Descartes when he began doubting the existence of things that purported to exist  --  which , you must admit , is a pretty unsettling state of mind to be in . I then asked myself if there was ever a time when I understood anything , and I remembered that when I was about ten I used to build radios . I loved to solder . The smell of melting solder was irresistible , and I would spend hour after hour in our basement  --  where my parents had made me a rudimentary workshop  --  soldering together wires to build little radios that actually worked . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If I could only build a radio now , I might feel better about . the whole thing . Around that time , I got the latest catalogue from the Edmund Scientific Company , in New Jersey ? the people who sold me the Solar Saucer . On page 114 I found this item : " Electronic Kits You Build , 100 Projects : Learn about electronics without soldering . That was too bad , but you ca n't have everything . Build 100 projects with 36 plug-in modules . Includes : antenna , speaker , 2 transistors , diodes &; more . " They also offered a de-luxe kit , which you can use to make a hundred and fifty experiments , but I settled for a hundred . The other day , it came . It is called  --  I do n't know why  --  Gakken Electronic Blocks , and is made by a company called Creative Products , Inc. , in Santa Ana , Cali-fornia . When I opened the box , I must confess my heart sank . What was inside looked completely bewil-dering  --  so much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the closet for a few days . But last night I had one of those nights when you wake up at 2 A.M. thinking that it must be time to get up . I knew that I was n't going to get back to sleep for a couple of hours , so I decided to look into my electronic kit . Basically , it looks like a pegboard , and you plug into it sort of green plastic vials that have symbols stamped on one end of them standing for various electronic components , like condensers , resistors , and transistors . When I was a kid , I loved resistors . I did n't know exactly what they did , but they came in wonderful colors . A tiny resistor in the kit also has wonderful colors . I started in with the first experiment , which is to build a little circuit that lights a light bulb . It requires eight plastic vials , and after I plugged them in , the light lit up . A marvellous moment . Then I went after the sim-plest radio experiment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the modern version of the first radio detector , which simply captures the radio waves out of the atmosphere . It has no power source , like a battery , but just runs off the waves . The direc-tions warned that the signals might be too weak to hear without a giant antenna . I did n't hear any-thing and I did n't have a giant antenna , so I went for broke . I put together something called the Transistor Reflex Radio . It requires eighteen plastic vials and works off batteries and , according to the directions , would operate off the antenna in the kit . Almost feverishly , I began to plug in my vials . I felt like Marconi . I then attached the antenna and the little earphone , and , by God , I began to hear voices ! Real voices ! It was one of those all-night talk shows . At first , I could n't quite make out what they were saying , but after fiddling with my new radio for a while the voices became clearer and I very distinctly heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stationed every fifty feet , the crime rate would drop to zero . " I turned off the radio and went back to bed . We live in a strange world . Turns of the Wheel SO much of what never stops going on in the world , or even just in this city , disappears at such a ferocious gulp into the great maw of oblivion that when some event , however small , swims back into our attention we get an extra tinge of pleasure from the recurrence itself . One previously remembered moment came around again the other morning as we found ourself making an enthusiastic circuit of the parking lot outside the Tavern-onthe-Green , in Central Park , astride a zippy small-wheeled bicycle , in front of a cheerful knot of early breakfasters waiting their turns in the saddle . We could remember several roughly similar occasions , including one that involved a moped , but what struck us this time was a moment in October of 1980 when , meandering through an engineering show at the Coliseum , we had watched a young man called Steven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ similar small-wheeled machine , and do it so gracefully and with such smooth and skillful insouciance that we had spent some time talking with him there , to find out how he had brought his remarkable small bicycle , which he then called the Urban , into being . ( We ought to confess early to an abiding passion for bicycles , which rank in our book among the more lyrical of human creations and , without any question , among the more sensible . ) Mr. Titcomb told us then that he had developed and built the Urban at home in Boston , on his private time , over some five years ; and after giving it a whirl ourself we had felt so enthusiastic about it that we left the Coliseum with a vision of the world thronged with those elegant , silent little machines . Well , we are happy to report that Mr. Titcomb 's little bicycle , instead of becoming a Spruce Goose , looks as though it might very well multiply , and soon . What we in fact encountered the other morning at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ingenious , and called , in what we must suppose to be the carefully calculated product-language of the eighties , the Creative Motion Industries CM-1000 ? a heavy appellation , we felt , for such a sharp little machine to bear on its small frame . The first person we spotted on our arrival was Steven Titcomb himself , crouched over one of his creations , tinkering and tuning until the last moment . He knows his own bicycle so well now that his attention to it is close to stethoscopic . We reintroduced ourself across time , and found him as gracious as ever but on this occasion elegantly , turned out in a three-piece suit and surrounded by a number of eager-faced men whose appearance would not at a glance have brought bicycles to mind . The smell of fresh croissants was in the air , for the occasion began with a breakfast , inside the Tavern , held by a group called Creative Motion Industries , which had incorporated itself in August of last year and had placed its financial and commercial interests not just behind Steven Titcomb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long obsession with efficient human-propulsion systems and all their possible applications . We sat over our croissants with Arthur Gingrande , Jr. , of Garrett-Arthur Associates , which is a financial-planning and business-consulting firm in Cambridge , Massachusetts , and Mr. Gingrande , a stocky , vigorous man , told us that for him bicycling had long been a serious business  --  that , in fact , he had spent a good part of last summer getting into ten-speed trim . " We are essentially a financing company , ? he went on . " I knew Steve casually , and then we began to take a look at his machine , be shown all the possibilities of his propulsion system , which could be applied easily to scooters , to adult tricyIles , and , in manual form , to wheelchairs . So we set out to find a set of intelligent investors who would see the possibilities we were seeing , and here we are ! " A large , lighted screen bore across its top the legend " INTRODUCING A BICYCLE DESIGNED FOR THE WAI YOUR LEGS ACTUALLY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gleaming white version of the CM-1000 , folded into its most portable assembled size  --  fifty-five inches by twenty-six inches by eight . We could envision it tucked away in a corner of our office , or even under the bed . Two other models of the machine , opened out , stood on their kickstands , looking positively eager to go somewhere . The mysterious essence of a particular bicycle does not lend itself easily to explicit prose . At first glance , there is nothing about Mr. Titcomb 's machine  --  apart from a mechanical neatness that amounts to elegance  --  to distinguish it from other small-wheeled bicycles ( like the famous one designed in England by Alexander Moulton ) , many of which have come and gone . The CM-1000 's difference from other bicycles lies largely in its propulsion system  --  the consequence of the thinking that Mr. Titcomb has done since he became obsessed as a design student , seven years ago , with exploring and improving the functioning of certain human mechanisms . Brooding in particular on the chain-and-sprocket drive that had kept bicycle wheels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he realized that it was the downstroke of the leg that , combined with the pressure of the hands against the handlebars , was supplying the maximum power , and he worked on a propulsion system that would fully exploit this isometric thrust . The CM-1000 has no chain drive . Instead , its pedals are mounted on the hack ends of two levers , which move up and down parallel to the main frame . A downward push on either pedal transmits power directly to the back-wheel huh through a steel cable , and a concealed spring on each side of the frame returns the pedal to the upward position . The two pedal levers are independent of one another , so the bicycle can be propelled by one foot alone , by both feet pressed down simultaneously , or by conventional alternate pedalling . IYhat the rider notices at once is the effortlessness of the bike 's propulsion : with the ? smallest downward pressure on a single pedal , the bicycle glides into motion . Moreover , the small wheels give the bicycle a low center of gravity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is easily adjustable , thanks to beautifully designed clamps that can he tightened by hand ; and the rider finds himself riding upright , in a posture that feels close to stately  --  a marked change from the forward crouch of the ten-speed rider , whose eyebrows are inclined anxiously upward . While various officers of the company introduced themselves and one another , and put the CM-1000 into various forms of unexplicit prose , what we were all waiting for among the croissants was for words to turn into bicycles  --  to take wheel  --  and they did at last , when Mr. Titcomb , after making a few characteristically modest remarks about his machine , grasped the handlebars of one of the prototypes and , obviously relieved to have left words behind him , rode several mesmerizing circles in a small space that we onlookers surrounded . It was like riding around the breakfast table , and it put a quick end to breakfast : in no time we had all made our way out to the parking lot behind the two prototypes children eager for our turn . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make the bicycle 's easy grace dawn visibly on the face of the rider , and we were seized by a passing concern that someone might feel sufficiently exhilarated to cycle off into the early-morning fog and never be seen again . ? WE wanted a chance for a quieter word with Steven Titcomband , we must confess , another whirl on the CM-1000 ? so we took ourself along to the International Cycle Show at the Coliseum , to see how the CM-1000 was faring in big-wheeled company , for Creative Motion Industries had a small display space among the forests of other wheels . As we approached the Coliseum , we saw Mr. Titcomb riding figure eights on the broad span of sidewalk , stopping occasionally to answer head-scratching questions with his usual grave patience . We went on tip to the display space , and there had a word with the president of Creative Motion Industries , Richard Hornbeck , tall and black-mustached , who was manning the display and supplying remarkably agile technical explanations to passersby . " It 's quite funny to find myself doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a private consultant , and I was called in by Garrett-Arthur Associates to make a study of the bicycle market , and worked on it even before I met Steve . 1 discovered that bicycle commuting was rising to a remarkable degree , and a lot of things began to make sense . " Mr. Titcomb turned up at that moment , wheeling his CM-1000 , and set it on its kickstand . Mr. Hornbeck looked at it the way we imagine horse trainers look at winners . We went off with Mr. Titcomb to a quiet corner , furnished with chairs rather than bicycle saddles , where he seemed , for once , sufficiently relieved of public curiosity to put aside his serious question-answering manner . " You know , " he told us , " even after I 'd shown the Urban here that first time , and seen lots of interest shown in it , and even though all my patent applications were by then firmly lodged , I could just as easily have ended up back home in Boston with the bike in the living room , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ companies , like Huffy and Alcoa , were getting in touch with me , and it dawned on me that I had to take some protective action , because , even though I had a new job  --  as director of design with the ADE Corporation  --  I never stopped thinking about propulsion systems , and about more and more possibilities . So I took the advice of friends and , last March , got in touch with Garrett-Arthur , in Cambridge , and they brought in what turned out to be just the right people , like Richard Hornbeck , to relieve me of all the corporate thinking that has to come between just making something and having it exist as a product . Looking back now , I feel that it took no time at all . We held meetings and talked a lot about the possible applications of the propulsion principle , and by the third of those meetings we had the support of enough financial and scientific professionals to raise the necessary funds . I resigned my job in August , we looked at a few sites @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in Danvers . It was fairly clear-cut . After all , I did n't have to sell people on an idea  --  I 'd built the bike , there it was , and it helped a lot in showing the people who came into the project all the possibilities of the propulsion system , and in letting them in on some of the other applications that had been taking shape in my head all along . " How had it been , setting up his own working headquarters , we asked him . He lit up like a reflector . " It was a blast ! I could design my own lab and shop ; I hired assistants and consultants ; we talked all the time . One of my consultants , an engineer named John Sofia , even taught me things I had n't quite realized about my own bicycle . That gear ratio , for example , which is mechanically controlled on chain-driven bicycles , in mine becomes something much more like a biological function  --  like a decision the leg makes about how hard to push , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over six years doing all this stuff in my living room , and trying out my bicycle in the corridors of my apartment house late at night , and that now I have enthusiastic company . We feed our variables into computers and get back instantly the data I used to scribble away at alone . And people keep coming to me with amazing notions  --  things I 'm bursting to try . As for the CM-1000 , we still have to settle a handful of small quibbles about the prototype , but the real problems are all virtually solved . So about two months from now  --  not much later  --  we 'll go into production , and by July the bicycle will actually be available . I mean , people will be able to go and buy one . It will cost about three hundred and fifty dollars , by the company 's reckoning . Of course , I 'm pleased in all kinds of ways , but I think that what pleases me most is that the bicycle always made a lot of sense to me , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't you think ? " Group THE American Group Psychotherapy Association held its fortieth-anniversary meeting here recently , and a few days later we received the following account of another regularly scheduled , but much smaller , gathering of kindred souls : BONNIE : Hi , Fred . FRED : Hi , Bonnie . Hi , Dr. Feldspar . ( Nods to others in group . ) THELMA : Hi , Fred . FRED : Guess where I was this weekend . BONNIE : Do n't play your games with us , Fred . Where were you ? FRED : I went to a convention on group therapy at the Waldorf-Astoria . THELMA : Oh . Oh . How interesting . Is that held every year ? FRED : I think so . BONNIE ( impatiently ) : Think . Think . That 's all you ever do , Fred . FRED : Sorry . I feel it 's held every year . Most people seemed to know each other . There was a fair amount of touching and hugging . THELMA : How exciting ! FRED : I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of sedate . But interesting . BONNIE : Could you be more specific ? Sometimes I find you irritatingly obscure . THELMA : Oh , I do , too . Bonnie , I like the way you said that . I wish I could say things like that , but I 'm too shy . FRED : There were workshops and films . There was an exhibit area . I tried out a miniature trampoline , about three by four feet and six inches off the ground , that is used to relieve tension . Every time I walked into the exhibit area , someone was bouncing on it , and someone else was trying out a massage chair that also relieves tension , and runs on six cents ' worth of electricity a day . BONNIE : Are you suggesting that I 'm cheap , Fred ? FRED : I thought you wanted to hear about the convention . THELMA : She does . We both do . FRED : Well , as I said , there was a subdued , relaxed atmosphere . There was a nice smell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was n't enrolled in , but no one stopped me. 1 sat next to this guy with a piece of paper pinned to his chest . It read , " Social Worker . Married . Warm . Tender . Strong . " Do n't ask me what that meant . I went to another meeting , of fifty or sixty people , where a therapist read a paper on intimacy and hostility as group phenomena . The paper took forever , but everyone sat quietly and did n't fidget  --  not even when he lost his place . People just seemed to understand . He was followed by a man who read a paper on how much a therapist should disclose of himself to his clients . The upshot was not too much and not too little . During that paper , a " It has come to my attention that somebody in here is only going through the motions . " woman stretched out on the floor in a nook at the back of the room . Then someone else stretched out , too , in another corner , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . BONNIE : Well , Fred , did you learn anything ? FRED : I learned that , as a group , group therapists appear to he laid-back , untroubled people . They are sort of the golden retrievers of humanity . THELMA : What on earth does that mean , Fred ? I wish you would n't be so intellectual all the time . FRED : Oh , you know . Responsible , benevolent , helping to lead people out of darkness and danger and into the light . BONNIE ( angrily ) : I feel you 're being disparaging , Fred . Not only to us but to Dr. Feldspar . THELMA ( crouching behind chair ) : Bonnie , I admire your anger . Fred , I understand your metaphor , but 1 hope you did n't hurt Dr. Feldspar 's feelings . ? ? BONNIE : Dr. Feldspar ? ( She shakes his shoulder . ) Why does he look like that ?

When I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outside the hotel . Guess what he was singing . BONNIE ( wearily ) : Oh , Fred . FRED : Guess . DR . FELDSPAR : Do n't play your games with us , Fred . What was he singing ? FRED : " People . " BONNIE : You 're kidding . DR . FELDSPAR : " People " ? FRED : It 's true . You know ? " People . " ( Begins to sing in soft tenor voice . ) " People .
