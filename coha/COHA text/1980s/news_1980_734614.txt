txt WE YEARS HAVE passed since - Dennis Smith last spoke in these pages . His smoke-burned Irish eyes were n't smiling then , and they 're even sadder now . Part of this comes from the chronic conjunctivitis that plagues him , a painful badge of honor from a thousand ghetto fires . But mostly Smith suffers resignation and fury over the decline of a heroic profession . Dennis Smith , you may recall , is the poetical New York City firefighter who writes books , one of which ? " Report from Engine Co. 82 , " based upon his grueling experiences dodging bullets and bricks to save blazing slums in the South Bronx ? was a best seller . Now 40 and a millionaire author and magazine publisher , he still pulls regular duty on Ladder Truck 81 . In a North Bronx high-rise enclave . Honored for heroism , he is a cautious veteran Fireman First Grade usually assigned to roofs or vents . He has been on the lob 17 years and could have retired two years ago . He does n't really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while Smith may be an intellectual with a graduate degree who quotes Kant and sings the Irish poets , he still views himself as a firefighter . He has won regard as an advocate as well as a conscience . His voice is sensitive , authentic , and honest , which probably explains why his monthly magazine , Firehouse , has grown into the world 's largest fire service journal with 800,000 readers . " TILE COMPANIONSHIP of the firehouse is important to me , " he says . " I guess the excitement matters , too . And // tempo Poetical ' fireman takes hard look at the labor ' of his love // there 's a discipline In getting up each morning , going to work , and not being allowed by regulation to call ' In sick ? we must have a written note from a doctor . I miss not being able to attend writers ' seminars and such , but I write from experience and I get it on the job . It gives a certain rhythm to my life . At the same time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have some sort of book in progress . " Smith has been writing since he was 18 , but he had never tried to get his work published . Then he penned a fiery letter to the New York Times Book Review challenging an argument by Joyce Carol Oates . She 'd written that William Butler Yeats became a universal poet only when he rejected his ? rishness . He signed the letter " Dennis Smith , New York firefighter , " which intrigued the New Yorker magazine enough to seek him out for an interview . That , in turn , led to a publisher 's commission and Smith 's 1972 " Report , " which sold 1.5 million copies . Smith never has altered his romantic view that firemen comprise a special breed of primarily young men with a yen for adventure and an unusually strong commitment to their work . FIREFIGHTERS , to him , are exemplified by William Kinsella , 37 , of Chicago 's 12th Battalion , a 20-year veteran who won Firehouse magazine 's 1979 award for heroism . Smith says most firemen are dedicated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think firemen should havea contract but I do n't think they should strike . But Mayor Byrne 's response was unconscionable . There was a casualness to it , a flippancy about what this work requires . ' crawling on hands and knees through a flaming , smoke-choked apartment at 6815 S. Throop St. on St. Patrick 's Day , 1978 , to drag a mother and her three daughters to safety . It has been only in the last 10 years , Smith says , that firefighters somehow got lumped into the amorphous mass of city workers ? " To management , this made them the enemy . " Smith tried to use his publicity to warn officials of the consequences . He predicted labor unrest long before the first pickets had encircled a firehouse some 200 strikes ago . But in 1973 , Smith reluctantly found himself joining New York firemen in a five  --  hour walkout that shook the city and strikers alike . Nothing , though , dismayed him as much as Chicago 's recent debacle . " I WAS HERE AND SAW what went on , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most serious firefighters strike in history . And it was unnecessary . To me , the whole thing was tragic . " My position is clear ? I think firemen should have a contract , but I do n't think they should strike . I 've never seen one that was productive . But Mayor Byrne 's response was unconscionable . There was a casualness to it , a flippancy about what this work requires . Not only did she risk the lives of Chicagoans , but of the nonstriking firemen as well . " She sent people into burning buildings who had absolutely no idea of what fire is like . Do n't forget that firefighters know , as no one else knows , the consequences of fire : How fast it is . What it does . The knowledge requirod to save a life , " In my opinion after having interviewed those picketers , public safety was more on the minds of striking firemen than the mayor and her staff . Their behavior ' was just plain immoral . " Usti estally ? ? Oa have  --  ieen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that would have made that other Chicago Fire seem like a 2-11 . " It 's one of those things nobody will believe until it happens , " he says with . a shrug . " Meanwhile , these strikes are tearing us apart . The betrayal and distrust will last for years . " NO MATTER what you 've heard , most firefighters are terribly concerned about what the public thinks of thorn . The men in Chicago recognize what they ' have given up in public esteem . Some say the esteem never put bread on the table , and I ca n't dispute that . But the root cause , I think , is that they resent no longer being special . " I know the fire commissioner here ( Richard Albrecht ) . He 's a decent man with a long family history in the fire department . When we struck in 1073 , there was a guy I worked with named Eddie Bresnan . We use a distribution nozzle that was invented by his grandfather . Eddie was a fourth-generation firefighter . He was born in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he quit the job . " ' I ca n't do this , ' he said . It forced him out . That 's just one little illustration of what 's been going on . I know firemen who are contemplating suicide because the pressures are so great . " In Smith 's view , despite campaign promises by the mayor , the Chicago strike " most definitely " occurred because of the leadership of union chief ' Frank Muscare . " As I said before , I 'm not sure a strike was necessary . And I think illus. care could have gotten them back sooner than 23 days . He should haVe had better relations with the other leaders and the Chicago Federation of Labor . And he did n't play the politics and the newspapers the way he should have . " I 've never seen such generally anti-labor sentiments in newspapers in my entire life . I read only one column that was supportive of the firemen . " INSTEAD OF seeking ways to quickly end the strike , it seems to Smith that the city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The mayor said striking firefighters were unfit to wear ever again the blue shirts of the Chicago Fire Department . Her husband said that Muscare was ' making novenas that 50 people would die in a fire . ' All the rhetoric did was inflame both sides . " It never would have happened in New York . First off , it 's a real union town . Nobody would have touched a hose . But when a crisis exists , people in power deal with it quietly . Some ? body 's always striking there , but they solve it by shutting , up and working to resolve the dispute . " To Smith , the key issue in the Chicago settlement involved adequate manning of stations and equipment . The firefighters may now have a contract , but he says their immediate future holds inevitable harassment . " The chiefs are going to get even . They can do , it easily enough . Just by transferring people around . Pulling more inspections . All strictly legal . In Kansas City , for instance , the men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did was yank the beds out of the firehouses and change all their hours . He ordered eight  --  hour tours , which I think are dangerous . A fireman should be in his house , rested , sober , ready to work at optimum strength . That was the idea behind long tours in the first place . I think it 's essential . People forget how physical this work is . " AS FOR Ills OWN LIFE , Smith seems content to direct his complex energies. ? His firehouse responds to 2,500 calls a year , which is a lot , but nothing near the 700 a month he formerly faced with Engine Co. 82 . While out fighting fires , though , he also must support-a full-time staff of 17 who help put out the magazine . Than there are his five children , all In private schools . ( " Tuition for each is $3,500 a year . Can you believe it ? " ) Dennis Smith , thus , has expenses . He has made money with nonfiction as well as fiction centering on firefighters and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ice " ( Dutton , $9.05 ) , has just appeared , and a travel book about Ireland 's Aran Islands is due next fall . Not all critics are ecstatic about Smith 's recent novels , including the now one . As a fireman he may be professional , as a novelist he has been called amateurish . He dismisses bad reviews : " Hey , when you write books , you stick your head above the water . You 're gon na get shot at . " SMITH 'S CURRENT concern ? and the theme of " Glitter and Ice " ? involves fires in public places ? bars , restaurants , dance halls , and discotheques . " The fire codes are n't nearly comprehensive enough , " he says . " These places are springing up too fast . People are in terrible danger . While I was writing the book , sure enough ; we had the Beverly Hills Club fire in Kentucky , the Bronx Social club fire , and the Blue Angel in New York , where 72 people died . " No sooner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Eve in Chapels , Quebec . That was a dance hall fire net by an arsonist in the front of the room . Forty-four people died at the back door . In my book , . I have 43 people dying in the same sort of room . The coincidence overwhelmed me . " But then , Dennis Smith has been proven prophetic before .
