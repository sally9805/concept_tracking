The U.S. Constitution directs that federal judges " shall hold their Offices during good Behaviour . " Last week the House of Representatives concluded that the behavior of one of those jurists , U.S. District Judge Alcee Hastings of Miami , was not good enough . By a lopsided vote of 413 to 3 , the chamber approved 17 articles of impeachment against him . The main accusation : Hastings conspired to obtain a $150,000 bribe in exchange for granting leniency to two convicted racketeers . The House action puts Hastings , 51 , in a very select circle . He becomes only the twelfth judge , and the first black , in U.S. history to be impeached . He is also the first judge to be subjected to the procedure after acquittal in a criminal trial . <P> Hastings promptly branded the House action a " disgrace " and a * " manifestation of institutional ignorance . " From the beginning , and ever more vociferously since his acquittal in 1983 , the liberal judge has professed innocence and insisted that race and politics were the prime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Carter appointee has sometimes been labeled a " defendant 's judge . " In the early 1980s he issued rulings favoring Haitian refugees seeking to remain in the U.S. <P> When the Judicial Conference of the U.S. recommended last year that the House consider impeachment , the Congressional Black Caucus maneuvered to have the matter placed in the hands of a judiciary subcommittee headed by black Congressman John Conyers . Conyers began as an avowed Hastings sympathizer . But as the hearings unfolded , he says , " the totality of the evidence began to pile up . " Last week Conyers drew a standing ovation from the House floor as he pressed his colleagues to vote for impeachment . The judge " has failed to measure up , " the Michigan Democrat declared . Voting in favor of impeachment was a painful task for the civil rights coalition in the House . The dissenters also shared the anxiety . Said California Congressman Mervyn Dymally of his negative vote : " In the final analysis I wanted to be able to sleep . I just had to go by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Hastings ' problems stem from his longtime friendship with William Borders , a prominent Washington attorney , who was convicted in a separate trial in 1982 . After learning from an informant that Borders claimed to be a conduit for bribes to Hastings , the FBI commissioned a retired agent to pose as one of two brothers convicted of racketeering in the judge 's courtroom . The impersonator struck a deal with Borders . In exchange for $150,000 , Borders would get Hastings to reduce the brothers ' punishment . Two meetings and a cryptic wiretapped phone conversation ensued between Hastings and Borders , followed by an order from the judge that $845,000 in confiscated funds be returned to the brothers . Hastings counters , however , that his ruling was dictated by two appellate-court decisions , rather than the Borders deal , of which he claims to know nothing . None of the bribe money has ever been traced to Hastings ' pockets , and the evidence against him is circumstantial.                   @ @
