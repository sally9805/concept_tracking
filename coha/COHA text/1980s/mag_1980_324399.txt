The generals cross swords with the Army Secretary <P> His credentials shine like the medals on a war hero 's chest . He graduated from Harvard with honors and from Yale Law School . Before he was 30 he became an assistant to McGeorge Bundy , who was National Security Adviser to Presidents Kennedy and Johnson , and then was named chairman of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission . Thus when Jimmy Carter in 1977 appointed Clifford L. Alexander , now 47 , the Army 's first black Secretary , he seemed well suited for the job , even though his only previous military experience was six months as a private in 1958 . <P> But almost from his first day in the Pentagon , Alexander has been embroiled in arguments with his generals . Most of the disagreements stem from Alexander 's insistence that the nation 's seven-year-old all-volunteer force ( AVF ) is " as good or better " than the old Army , which filled its ranks mostly with draftees . The generals echo the official line in public . But in private they claim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lower standards to meet recruiting goals . Says one general of his peers : " All of them are lying when they say , ' We do n't need a draft . ' Get any one of them in the evening , with a martini in his hand , and he will say , ' Of course we need a draft . ' " <P> Critics accuse Alexander of ignoring or explaining away data that suggest the AVF is not working . All inductees , for example , must take a battery of tests that group them by mental ability , from the brightest ( Category I ) to the dullest ( Category V ) . A study this summer showed that a disturbingly high 46% of the 1979 recruits ranked in Category IV . Those in Category V are automatically rejected as unfit . Alexander sided with consultants who concluded that the real problem was the Army 's use of a test that was designed to measure aptitudes rather than intelligence . He ordered all scores removed from personal records , to keep them from being misused . Says Alexander @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perform as soldiers . " Yet , on a test that evaluated on-the-job performance , 89% of the motor vehicle drivers and 85% of the Huey helicopter repairmen failed . <P> Many generals fear that the Army 's fighting ability will be eroded by favoritism showed by Alexander toward women . Recruiting of women was made easier by Alexander last year when he eliminated the requirement that all female enlistees be high school graduates ; there had been no such requirement for men , though Congress has directed that 65% of all recruits , male or female , have high school diplomas . Some 65,000 women now serve in the Army , compared with 45,000 in 1976 . Alexander also believes that the last barriers prohibiting women from being put in combat units should be eliminated . The brass disagrees . Says Army Chief of Staff Edward C. Meyer , in a rare public rejoinder : " I do n't think women should be assigned a direct combat role . I do n't believe the Army should try that experiment . "          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
