This story is a composite of stories appearing in the 05-14-87 Sports Final and the National edition . Like a wily poker player waiting for the right card , veteran driver Al Unser Sr. hung in there until he got the one he wanted . Owner Roger Penske dealt it to him Wednesday , anteing up for the three- time Indy 500 winner by hiring him to replace injured Danny Ongais as the third driver on the Penske team for the May 24 classic . Ongais , 44 , was injured last Thursday when he crashed his Chevrolet- powered Penske PC-16 during practice . Unser , who drove for Penske last year but appeared in only five races , had been without a ride since Penske cut him loose during the 1986 season . Unser had been actively but cautiously seeking a ride . " I had several offers , and I turned them down , " said the 47-year-old Unser . " Everybody out here has new cars , but do they have the budget to take the pressure that comes at this place and go 500 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He promptly took over a Cosworth-powered 1986 March that was shipped in by van Wednesday from the team ' s factory in Reading , Pa. , after Penske and Unser came to an agreement by telephone Tuesday night . After the deal was struck , the scenario moved fast . The moment the car arrived at the Speedway , officials of the sanctioning United States Auto Club went to Penske ' s garage in Gasoline Alley and put it through technical inspection . This normally is done in a much more leisurely fashion at the USAC inspection station . Unser took the car out on the track just before the mandatory 6 p. m. closing time and got the speed up to 197. 585 miles an hour on the second of his two hot laps . Afterwards , Unser was all smiles . " It feels good , " he said . " Any time you get in a race car and enjoy racing as I do , it ' s good to get back . " These guys ( Penske ' s crew ) did one of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s a first-place team . Whatever it takes , Penske tries to make it happen . With him , it will be a three-car team with everybody equal . " " It ' s really something to come to Indy and three days before the second qualifying weekend come up with a driver like Al in a situation like this , " said Penske . " It ' s a good opportunity for Al and we ' re happy about it . He knows us and we know him . " The driver change was made necessary by the decision of Dr. Henry Boch , Speedway medical director , that Ongais is not yet fully recovered from the concussion he suffered in his practice accident . The rich and powerful Penske team , which entered six cars in the 1987 Indy race , couldn ' t convert Unser ' s " new " car to the favored Chevrolet power because of a shortage of accessory parts , team manager Derrick Walker said . Don ' t be surprised if all three Penske drivers are in year-old Marches by race day . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it last weekend on the outside of the front row at 211. 467 m. p. h . Danny Sullivan qualified a PC-16 Chevy at 205. 288 , good for 11th in the tentative grid , but Penske obviously isn ' t satisfied . Sullivan will test an ' 86 March Chevy this week , leading to speculation that Sullivan ' s and Unser ' s cars could be juggled going into the last weekend of time trials . " We ' re pretty flexible , " Penske said.
