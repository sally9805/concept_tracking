On the eve of the resumption of dis- armament negotiations in Geneva last week , Soviet General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev mixed some tough talk on the nuclear arms race with conciliatory noises about the need for East-West detente . During a meeting in Moscow with former West German Chancellor Willy Brandt , Gorbachev dismissed the first round of the Geneva negotiations , completed in April , as " completely fruitless " and insisted that U.S. plans for space weapons , or Star Wars , research would " dramatically increase the threat of a truly global , all-destroying military conflict . " <P> Two days later , in talks with another visitor , Italian Prime Minister Benedetto Craxi , Gorbachev delivered an even blunter message . U.S. refusal to halt the Star Wars program , he warned , could lead to not only " the subversion of the Geneva talks but the scrapping of every prospect for an end to the arms race . " <P> If that represented Moscow 's stick , Gorbachev also held out a carrot . At a dinner for Craxi , Gorbachev called for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the essence of detente " and promised that " the ( arms reduction ) proposals made by us some time ago are still standing . " He renewed an offer to shrink the number of Europe-based Soviet missiles to 162 , equal to that of British and French nuclear missiles ; he also revived a 1983 proposal to freeze Soviet **26;8033;TOOLONG deployment in Asia if nuclear cuts could be achieved in Europe . The U.S. has previously rejected both proposals . Gorbachev also hinted that he would like to see direct relations , presumably to facilitate commerce , between the European Community and COMECON , the East bloc trading group . <P> Gorbachev 's overtures were clearly aimed at Western Europe . Some analysts assume that he is trying to encourage anti-Star Wars sentiment in member states of the Western alliance by linking missile reductions in Europe to abandonment of the U.S. space-weapons scheme . According to a West European diplomat in Moscow , Gorbachev may " try to separate at least parts of Europe from the U.S. on the subject of Star Wars . " <P> A similar approach by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the 1983 controversy over the deployment in Western Europe of U.S. Pershing II and cruise missiles . But Moscow apparently thinks it worth another try . Brandt , whose Social Democratic Party opposes the Star Wars plan , offered Gorbachev some comfort by suggesting that the Geneva talks would go nowhere until the superpowers agree that space weapons and nuclear-missiles issues are " interrelated . " Craxi , for his part , cautioned the Soviet leader against taking hard positions and proposed that the three subjects under discussion in Geneva  --  space weapons , strategic nuclear arms and Europe-based intermediate-range missiles  --  could be approached at differing speeds .
