 | The nearly $1 trillion budget Ronald Reagan presented to Congress in early February may be his toughest ever . It certainly is the most stringent in terms of spending cuts . To comply with Congress 's new budget-balancing law and get the deficit down to $143.6 billion for the 1987 fiscal year without raising taxes , the President wants to end or sharply reduce 40 programs ? more than ever . In previous budgets , Reagan has proposed cutting more dollars , but never has his knife cut such a wide swath . And the budget certainly will be one of the toughest to push through Congress . Even before receipt of the document , Republicans and Democrats alike had begun distancing themselves from it . Senator Slade Gorton ( R-Wash. ) accused the White House of trying " to cram cuts in vital and important services down the throats of the American people . " Senator Bill Bradley ( D-N.J. ) said he doubted that " there are 25 votes in the Senate " for it . Now a new obstacle of unknown dimension is compounding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ D.C. , ruled February 7 that a key part of the controversial Gramm-Rudman law that could force Congress to cut the deficit is unconstitutional . Though the court stayed the effect of its decision pending a Supreme Court review , probably by summer , the action created new confusion in the government and raised the specter of another year of budget gridlock . ( See box on page 27 . ) Warned James Miller , the President 's budget director : If the decision is upheld , " Congress might sit on its hands . " If the President 's budget is If the President has his way ? and Gramm-Rudman survives ? Americans in all walks of life will feel the pinch enacted , it would hit almost every American , every section of the country and every sector of the economy . An analysis by U.S.News &; World Report shows that the middle class , which by and large has avoided major pain in the past , would suffer this time . The poor , last clobbered in 1981-82 , would take another hit . The elderly , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medicare . Hard-pressed farmers would lose valuable credit subsidies , and big and small business would lose programs such as the Small Business Administration and direct loans from the Export-Import Bank , which they have fought to retain . A few of Reagan 's favorite programs not only escaped but won pledges of added support . Despite the record peacetime military buildup of the Reagan years , defense spending would get another boost . So would exploration of space and drug and law enforcement . A smaller deficit is not the only item on the President 's agenda this year . In his state-of-the-union address , Reagan proposed new domestic and international initiatives . He asked Health and Human Services Secretary Otis Bowen to come up with a plan to protect senior citizens from the high cost of treatment for catastrophic illness ; Atty . Gen. Edwin Meese as head of the White House Domestic Policy Council to recommend reform of the welfare system , and Treasury Secretary James Baker to look into ways to moderate the volatility of international currency-exchange rates . Though he has drawn a bead on domestic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to prescribe his harshest medicine this year . The new Gramm-Rudman budget-balancing law mandates a $144 billion deficit for the 1987 fiscal year that begins next October 1 and a balanced budget by 1991 . If the White House and Congress fail to agree on a budget , the law ? if it stands ? requires across-the-board budget cuts in October to drive the deficit down to the target . Half the cuts would come from the Pentagon and half from domestic spending . Social Security and programs for the poor would be exempt . Furthermore , the law stipulates that ultimately the comptroller general , who can be fired only by Congress , would decide whether and where to make the cuts . But the district court in Washington said that by granting this power to the comptroller general over the President , the law went too far , violating the constitutional separation of powers between Congress and the President . To avoid the mandatory  | Gramm-Rudman cuts , Reagan proposed holding spending to $994 billion and collecting $850.4 billion in receipts . That will take some doing . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ billion of domestic-program cuts . Democrats , especially , will challenge Reagan 's plan to save $10.7 billion by lopping non-needy beneficiaries from the rolls of social-service programs and imposing administrative reforms . Reagan wants to save an additional $2.3 billion by ending a slew of federal-aid and regulatory programs . Among them : The Economic Development Administration , the Interstate Commerce Commission , the Appalachian Regional Commission , Amtrak subsidies and urban-development grants . It will be especially tough for Reagan to win backing for his proposal to raise $6.8 billion in extra revenue by selling some federal assets . In his budget , he hung a " for sale " sign on a variety of what he described as " commercial type " government operations that compete with services provided by the pri vate sector . The President wants to sell five agencies that market federal electric power at subsidized rates in the Pacific Northwest , the Southwest , the Southeast and Alaska . Also on the sales counter are the Navy 's oil reserves , a portfolio of government loans and surplus federal property . The Federal Housing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up for sale in the future . Reagan could have greater ? though spotty ? success with his plan to pick up $2.5 billion by imposing higher or new charges on users of a variety of government services , such as national parks and forests , the Coast Guard and Customs Service , inland waterways and federal loan guarantees . The President 's newest effort to rein in domestic government spending faces tougher going than previous attempts because it comes on top of cuts achieved earlier and exempts Social Security . If enacted in toto , which is unlikely , the result would be not only to abolish whole categories of aid but also to make it harder for people to qualify for the assistance that is left and to make them pay more out-of-pocket costs . But if successful , the result would be dramatic ? the sharpest dollar drop in the deficit in history , from $202.8 billion in 1986 to a $1.3 billion surplus in 1991 . Reagan 's difficulty will be in persuading Congress to go along with even minor parts of the plan . Congress has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Most of Reagan 's domestic-spending cuts also have been rejected by Congress in the past . But this year could be different . Even if Gramm-Rudman does not survive , congressional leaders say its spirit will . " Gramm-Rudman still lives , " no matter what happens in the courts , said Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole . " The federal deficit is going to be center stage this session of Congress . " That could  | force the White House and Congress to agree on a " grand compromise " on the budget in the months ahead . Domesticprogram cuts would be a part of any deal . In all likelihood , so would a tax increase . Key Republicans , as well as Democrats , see higher taxes as the adhesive necessary to seal a deficit pact . " The solution will be a revenue component to glue it all together , " says Senator Pete Domenici ( R-N.M. ) , chairman of the Senate Budget Committee . Momentum is building in both parties to hold tax reform hostage until a deficit accord is reached . Among the Republicans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be used to reduce the deficit before tax reform is taken up . Defense spending could be a major sticking point . The President asked Congress for what he called a " bare minimum " increase in defense funding of 3 percent after adjustment for inflation . But the request touched off a firestorm of protest . Key legislators claim the increase being sought really is 8 percent because it is based on funding levels before they were lowered by GrammRudman this year . Representative Les Aspin ( D-Wis. ) , chairman of the House Armed Services Committee , condemned the Reagan request as a " shill . " The President plans to go to the people to defend his military buildup . He will deliver a televised speech to the nation , probably on February 19 , and journey the next day to the island of Grenada . The visit to the site of the 1983 invasion will be to meet with Caribbean leaders , but the President hopes it also will remind Americans of the need for military strength . Congress is n't likely to be impressed . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cuts in his plans seem inevitable . If the Gramm-Rudman vise is allowed to threaten deep cuts in his defense program , Reagan may be inclined to look more favorably on higher taxes as an alternative . He already has hinted that he may bend his 1984 " no tax hike " pledge as a last resort . He told reporters he would be " willing to look at " a new oil-import levy if that is needed to win enactment of a tax-reform plan to his liking . That was interpreted on Capitol Hill as a signal that Reagan also may be willing to negotiate , at the proper time , on taxes to clinch a deficit agreement . Congress will be pressured by voters to make a deal . One third of the Senate and all of the House are up for reelection this year . Polls indicate that voters rate the deficit as a top concern . Many lawmakers , therefore , wo n't want to tell constituents they failed to shrink the red ink . The tricky political issue is which party gets the blame for raising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the other side to flinch , " says Representative Leon Panetta ( D-Calif . ) . As the wheeling and dealing begins , here 's how USN &; WR assesses the impact of the President 's budget on broad segments of the population and a look at what 's likely to happen Middle Americans Much more so than in the past , middle-income Americans will take a hefty hit if this budget takes hold . Reagan 's main targets : Student and housing aid . Some 600,000 college and graduateschool students stand to lose federal aid . Reforms would , among other things , tighten the definition of who is independent from his or her parents and cut off benefits to students who do n't have a  | high-school diploma or the equivalent . Many of the 4.3 million students receiving benefits would face much higher loan costs . Currently , the government pays the interest on guaranteed student loans ( GSL ) while the student is in school . A new rule would end this benefit , requiring the student to pay the interest when due . To cushion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repay their debts . Middle and upper-income parents of about 10 million younger children would have to pay more for school meals as subsidies are eliminated . The bad news for would-be homeowners is that an estimated 553,000 applicants for Federal Housing Administration home-mortgage insurance would have to pay more . Premiums would be raised to 5 percent from 3.8 percent , and the insurance would be limited to families with annual incomes of less than $40,000 . The fee that ex-GI 's pay for Veterans Administration home-mortgage guarantees would rise from 1 percent to 2 percent and higher later on . Outlook : Many subsidies will be trimmed . User fees will be raised for mortgage insurance and housing loans . But neither the trims nor the fee increases will be as large as Reagan wants . In a large number of cases , political pressures will be so great that Congress wo n't be able to put together the majority needed to kill a program . The elderly Though Social Security benefits remain intact , senior citizens will find other benefits under fire . The 31 million elderly persons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health-care protection . Monthly premiums for coverage of doctors ' and medical bills would rise from the present $15.50 to $17.80 next year and higher later on . Patients would have to pay the first $100 of expenses , up from $75 now . Many of the 19 million veterans who receive outpatient and hospital care at Veterans Administration facilities will lose out under a reform that restricts financial aid to lower-income families . Military and civilian federal retirees would lose 1987 cost-of-living rises . Future hikes would be less than inflation . Outlook : The elderly will have to pay higher premiums for medicare . VA health care will be limited to low-income veterans . Government retirees will lose cost-of-living pension increases for the year . The poor Low-income groups were hit hard when Reagan first came into office , but they have largely been spared recently . This time around , they are n't as lucky . Employable welfare and food-stamp recipients would have to work to continue receiving assistance . Some 10.8 million people now collect welfare checks , and 19.5 million get food stamps . By putting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taxpayers $238 million in welfare and $313 million in food-stamp expenses . Only the neediest 22,000 of the 40,500 youths now being trained by the Job Corps would stay in that program . Poor youngsters anticipating federally subsidized summer jobs could find fewer available as the program is changed to give top priority to metropolitan areas with high youth unemployment . Low-income families would use vouchers to help pay for housing and special education in the marketplace . If Reagan has his way , both the Community Services block- grant program , which provides social services for the poor , and the Legal Services Corporation , which provides the poor with free legal aid , would go out of business . Outlook : Congress is reluctant to take another whack at the poor . Requiring able-bodied welfare and foodstamp recipients to look for work stands a good chance of acceptance . Farmers Farmers ca n't look for many breaks . The administration expects to hold price supports at the legal minimum , hoping that rising prices will boost rural incomes . Other federal help would be trimmed back , with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system would be substituted for the present rural-housing program . Electric bills could rise as the Rural Electrification Administration , which subsidizes rates , is phased out . Farmers Home Administration credit would be cut sharply . A user fee would be charged on export loans . Outlook : Rural-housing and crop-insurance programs will be sliced but not terminated . In the end , conservation aid may be funded near the 1986 level . Business If the President has his way , business-subsidy programs would be hit hard . But he has tried to kill some of them before and failed . Once again , big business is being faced with the loss of direct export loans . The budget proposes to substitute an interest-rate subsidy for guaranteed loans . Small businesses could not get subsidized direct loans , guarantees and disaster aid from the Small Business Administration , which would be abolished . Businesses that now benefit from subsidized postal rates would pay higher mailing fees . A subsidy to airlines that serve small communities would end , too . Aid to business for energy research and development would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come from hiking fees they must pay to the government 's Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation to insure many retirement plans . Annual premiums would jump to $8.10 per worker from $2.60 . Outlook : Business may lose postal subsidies , export loans and the SBA . There also is a good chance that pension-insurance premiums will go up . But subsidies for local-service airlines , like many other programs that benefit business , probably will survive . Defense and space Reagan has n't flinched in his zeal to build up the military . This year 's budget seeks $311.6 billion in new spending authority . Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger argued that the 8 percent jump is necessary to " regain some of the momentum that we lost , " when the Pentagon got only $278.4 billion of the $313.7 billion it requested last year . The biggest gainer would be the Strategic Defense Initiative , or Star Wars , which Weinberger calls " the President 's highest priority . " SDI is down for a 75 percent jump to $4.8 billion in 1987 . When he first proposed SDI two years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years , but Congress has given him only half his annual dollar requests . Weinberger is reopening old battles over the MX and antisatellite ( ASAT ) missiles . Last summer , over his strenuous objections , Congress voted to cap the deployment of MX missiles at 50 and to end testing of ASAT . This year , Weinberger is asking for money to study ways to deploy another 50 MX missiles and for a big boost in ASAT funds . The Pentagon 's shopping list for hardware would allow the Army to buy 840 Ml tanks and 870 Bradley fighting vehicles , the infantry 's controversial new troop carrier ; the Navy to get four new attack submarines , one Trident-missile sub , two cruisers , three guided-missile destroyers , various other ships and 120 F/A-18 aircraft , and the Air Force to buy 48 F-15 fighter planes , 216 F-16 aircraft and 21 C-5 cargo planes . In space , the President wants to keep funding for a manned space station to start operating in the mid-1990s . Outlook : The President 's defense request will be scaled back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for SDI than he has in the past , but both the MX and ASAT requests will be denied . The hardware list will be trimmed . The National Aeronautics and Space Administration probably will get money to build a new shuttle orbiter to replace Challenger , which exploded January 28 . The fate of each budgetary item and program will , if the past is any guide , only be finally determined by protracted negotiations between the White House and both houses of Congress , which will drag on for most of the year . But if Gramm-Rudman ? or its spirit ? survives , government spending as a percentage of gross national product is almost certain to decline , and the deficit should finally begin to move downward . Otherwise , it 's likely to be business as usual ? political gridlock and stubbornly high deficits .
