THE HAPPIER DAYS FOR RYAN WHITE by Cory SerVaas , M. D. it would you like to say to the scientists who are trying to find a cure for AIDS ? " we asked Ryan White , the 16-year-old hemophiliac with AIDS who sat across from us on the comfortable living-room sofa at the Whites ' Cicero , Indiana , home . Without a moment 's hesitation , he replied , " I 'd like to tell them to hurry up . " One can hardly fault Ryan for his eagerness . A brilliant medical breakthrough had , in the early ' 70s , made hemophilia no longer a life-threatening disease . But then , through a quirk of fate , came the tragedy of AIDS . Undoubtedly , even while Ryan was receiving the disease by infusion , there were frustrated scientists at the Centers for Disease Control ( CDC ) who were already pounding on the table , insisting that the hemophiliacs should be warned and the high-risk blood donors deferred . Perhaps by the time Ryan was infused with the virus , there were scientists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ virus by heat-treating the Factor VIII ( blood-clotting agent ) that hemophiliacs receive . ( See companion article by Randy Shifts , excerpted from And the Band Played On . ) ? ? ? As often happens with infant hemophiliacs , Ryan White bled profusely after circumcision . His mother explained : " He was cir-cumcised in Kokomo , and he bled for three days before they real-ized that there was something wrong . They tried to stitch him ; they tried ointments and everything , and finally he had lost so much blood that they had to do something . So they transferred him to Methodist Hospital in Indianapolis . In fact , he had lost so much blood that by the time they got him down there they did n't know if he would make it . " It was then Jeanne White was told that her three-day-old son was a hemophiliac . " He had less than 1 percent clotting factor , so he is considered a severe hemophiliac , " she said . " He did fine with the clotting-factor infusions , " she said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about four or five years old , because he was averaging hospital stays two or three times a month . So they taught me how to give it . " When I go to Riley Hospital I pick up 10 or 12 batches . All of the batches are kept in my refrigerator until I use it up and go to get more . " At 13 , Ryan learned he had AIDS . Jeanne White said she believes that " unknowingly , I had infected him with a bad batch of Factor VIII 12 times without realizing it . " Ryan was the first hemophiliac in our area to be diagnosed , and he was one of the younger ones . Ryan had never had hepatitis , but then one year when we went in they asked me if Ryan had been sick or anything . They said , ' He shows that he 's been infected with hepatitis , that he 's had hepatitis . ' And I said , ' Well , yes , he was sick for about three or four months last year , but nobody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Well , there 's a lot of flu going around . . . " In 1984 , after Ryan came down with AIDS , they began having all the hemophiliacs that were seen at Riley Hospital come in to be tested . So between ' 84 and ' 85 they began finding out that all of the hemophiliacs were AIDS-antibody positive . " At the time he was diagnosed with AIDS , Ryan was a student at Western Middle School outside Kokomo . He was an honor student . He liked school . He had played baseball until being hit with a ball hard enough to cause bleeding . He had to quit that . At 13 , he had a girlfriend , Chris . " " But that did n't work out , " Ryan chimed in . This was before AIDS education had penetrated the heartland , and panic  --  fear from lack of knowledge  --  created a problem . " Then one of the TV stations called , " Jeanne said , " and asked if they were going to allow Ryan in school . I told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mean-while , they called the school , and the school said they were not going to ac- cept Ryan . I knew that all the other kids who were AIDS-antibody positive were going to school without any trouble , and they were just as contagious with the virus as Ryan was . " It was enough to break a mother 's heart  --  having the superintendent decide that Ryan could n't stay in school . Because Ryan 's diagnosis was one of the first in Indiana , fear and panic among parents caused a battle in the school district . It split the community . " They did n't know what to do about AIDS . They did n't want it involved in their lives , " Jeanne said . But as a parent , she understands their feelings . " That 's why I 've never been bitter , " she added . " People there now tell us that they wish they had spoken up for us . The fighting is over . " Jeanne White told of how the tragedy appeared from her vantage point : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it with the president of the National Hemophilia Foundation . I was very upset because they did n't come forward to help me out at all . I do n't mean with money  --  I mean support-wise . I could n't get any help from them when I was trying to get Ryan back into school , because I knew hemophiliacs all had it . They tried tohide AIDS among hemophiliacs . " I could n't go to the media and tell them that 95 percent of the severe hemophiliacs now were positive for AIDS , because then I would be hurting all my counterparts . I could n't do that to the mothers I 've talked to over all the years . " The president of the National Hemophilia Foundation told me , ' Well , we 're letting the medical profession fight our battles for us , because we 're trying to keep a very lowprofile . ' And I said , ' We 're talking about every child , every hemophiliac here . We 're not just talking about Ryan White . ' " I spent two hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was just very irate after I finished . He was a lawyer . He is no longer the president of the foundation . " Dr. Bruce Evatt , the resident hemophilia expert at the CDC , understood the confusion and the frustration Jeanne was feeling . His insights from his special perspective : " When you get hit by a tragedy like AIDS , there is , of course , a number of dif-ferent ideas on how to handle it . I think the early days were especially difficult , because at that point there were very few pa-tients that had developed AIDS . Most of the hemophilia-treat-ment physicians had invested a great deal of time and had seen these patients ' lives transformed by the blood-clotting material , and then the thought that this material that had been such a trans-forming gift had suddenly become a killer , so to speak , created a great deal of anxiety . Certainly there was a great deal of diversity of thinking as to the proper way of managing this continued on page 56 and in investigating such epidemics . It ranged all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' to panic and everything in between . I think that in those early days there were certainly a few people at the National Hemophilia Foundation who were very instrumental in getting everything on course and in developing some very sound processes for proceeding . " A New Life in Cicero After leaving Kokomo , Ryan said , " I did n't want to die there . I really did n't want to be buried there , either . I want to be buried here . I like it . It 's peaceful and quiet . " Ryan was referring to Cicero Cemetery . Ryan was recently out of school for two weeks with shingles . He had them on both sides with a lot of itching . Once again his mother had to take time off work . " I do n't get paid when I do n't work , " she told us , " and I 've had to miss an awful lot of work . But General Motors has been very cooperative . I 've missed way over the limit they allow , and still they 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to put Ryan in the hospital with his shingles , but he did n't want to go . Dr. Martin Kleiman was worried about infection , thinking that if any of them got infected , then we 'd be in trouble . Dr. Kleiman is the infectious-disease specialist who takes care of Ryan at Riley Hospital for Children in Indianapolis . The relationship between the two is beautiful , " Jeanne said . Jeanne furrowed her brow and continued , " Ryan is on AZT now . I do n't know . Everything I read about it now is bad . I read that it poisons your system . You do n't know what to do . He seems to be doing pretty good , and I just do n't know what the answer is . I know it 's scaring me now , but he was doing so bad when they put him on it , and of course it really made the difference . " One understands a mother 's anguish about a toxic drug , but one senses that this mother has good instincts . She reads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chances are that the new drugs for Pneumocystis pneumonia probably saved her son 's life when he first developed AIDS and was deathly ill and on a respirator to keep him alive . Dr. James Smith , an eminent pathologist at the Indiana University School of Medicine , has been trying to develop better drugs for keeping Pneumocystis patients alive longer since the mid-1970s , before the AIDS crisis began . Because such a large number of AIDS patients get Pneumocystis , new drugs for it have now taken high importance throughout the world . Indiana University recently received a large federal grant to study Pneumocystis under Dr. Smith 's direction . Jeanne does n't take all this for granted . Nor does Ryan . They both know that many of Ryan 's hemophiliac friends have already died . Ryan had a good pal from Boston with whom he liked to talk and compare notes . " But he is dead now , " Jeanne told us . Ryan and his mother both know that it 's the excellent care and the caring people in Indiana that have helped keep Ryan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Day , giving Ryan and his mother " Sagamore of the Wabash " awards , and his school the " Spirit of the Heartland " award , to thank them for their great courage in furthering the understanding of AIDS . " Fear frightens  --  it hearkens the unknown , the feeling of being in an unfamiliar dark room where you do n't feel safe , " Orr told more than 600 of Ryan 's classmates and teachers attending the ceremony . " Thank God you can turn on the light . " Bob Knight , the Indiana University basketball coach , invited Ryan to an I.U. tournament game as his guest . The HAM radio operators of Indiana have given him a Morse-code kit so he can get a license to talk to friends , whether with or without AIDS , around the world . The girls in school are hugging him again . Another factor in Mrs. White 's courage is keeping up the good fight for Ryan in her faith and that of her son . Ryan was baptized at the St. Luke 's United Methodist Church in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rockwell Bible . Jeanne White told us that he kneels in prayer every night to thank God for one more day . We asked him if he trusted in God . " Yes , I sure do , " he responded emphatically . " Does believing in what God says in the Bible make a difference for you ? " we asked . " Yes , there 's always hope with the Lord , " Ryan said . " Do you pray often ? " " Every day . " " Do you have any fears now ? " " Not really . I have a lot of trust in God . " You have a lot of hope for the future , do n't you ? " " A lot of hope , " Ryan said with feeling . His mother added , " I think the Lord has chosen Ryan for a reason , and I feel like the Lord 's going to take care of him . Ryan has done much better than most AIDS patients do . So how can we complain about that ? It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel that for a person who has AIDS , he has done very well . We can feel very fortunate for that . " Ryan 's faith and hope are in perfect harmony with another Methodist AIDS patient , the Rev. Donald Wade , who has recently recovered from a second bout of Pneumocystis pneumonia . Pastor Wade has not yet met Ryan , but he plans to . His wife teaches visually impaired children in the school district where Ryan now attends school . With his faith and positive out- look , Ryan White is anticipating a career in advertising . " It looks like fun , " he said . " I like to think up slogans and rhymes . " Thus , Pastor Wade may find in Ryan the ideal hero for a book he proposes to write , titled The Positive Side of AIDS . The positive side ? Who better to ask about that than the Rev. Donald Wade himself ? " The book will deal with some of the good things that happen to you as a result of AIDS , " he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enrichment and deepening and some of the humorous things that happen will present a different side to AIDS . " When Pastor Wade and his beautiful family visited our church last year , he told us the press should stop its con-tinual references to AIDS as invariably fatal and hopeless . " Yes , we are all going to die of something , you know , " he said . " And so much is being done in the way of research . I know that some of the medications I 've got-ten  --  I 'm sure two years ago they did n't have . I know they are helping me , and if I can just hang on , I 'm sure they 'll come up with some more good stuff . So I just feel like there is a positive side , and I know in my own life it has n't been all bad . It 's disappointing to have AIDS , but it certainly deepens one 's spiritual life . So , I think there is a positive story to tell . There are even some humorous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pastor Wade if he had a humorous incident we could pass on to Ryan . " Let me think for a minute , " he said . " Several fun things have happened . When I was speaking at church , this little girl  --  she was n't even a teenager  --  very seriously asked , ' Now , if I talk to you over the phone , or if I drink from the same drinking fountain , I ca n't get this from you , can I ? ' She was really very concerned  --  very sincere . She was n't just putting me on
