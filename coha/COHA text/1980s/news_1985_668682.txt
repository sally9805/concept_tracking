Wesley Kimler ' s exhibition of paintings and drawings at the Frumkin &; Struve Gallery , 309 W. Superior St. , proclaims a larger scale of ambition than usually is encountered in Chicago . Where the best-known local painters concentrate on the personal and the hermetic , Kimler seeks to break into an arena where a historical abstract painting style can be brought to bear on universal subject matter . The synthesis he attempts is between the improvisatory force of Abstract Expressionism and the heroic content usually lacking in contemporary painting . Earlier works shown at the Peter Miller Gallery imperfectly stated his intention . Here he comes closer to carrying it out . His underlying theme has remained the same : the interchangeability of hunter and hunted . But where Kimler previously relied on strong representation , here he derives greater strength from holding back a direct statement and allowing himself to be led by the process of painting . When it works  --  " Atlas , " " Matador of a Grey Dawn , " " Vaccinator "  --  the artist produces canvases in which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of course , it does not always work , for the task proves difficult and Kimler is young . The trick is to know the difference , but that won ' t be easy either , given that enough skill is apparent to get the sycophants shouting . Now is the time for Kimler to judge himself very , very sternly . ( Through Tuesday . ) THOM BOHNERT ( Exhibit A , 361 W. Superior St. ) : Bohnert ' s mixed-media drawings succeed in conveying the sensations of motion and play that are communicated by his sculpture . Still , the two bodies of work are separate , clearly from the same hand but referring less to each other than to their own distinct traditions . Only one of the 12 pieces makes a passing glance at the contour of a vessel . The rest draw upon a small arsenal of colors and lines to imply a range of high-spirited physical action . They are rather like having Alexander Calder ' s " Circus " recast in the laconic two-dimensional terms of Richard Tuttle . The linear invention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yet nothing about it is simple . The wonder comes from having deployed minimal forms on each page so deftly that extremely tight control is translated to the viewer as freewheeling energy . ( Through Saturday . ) VLADIMIR GERMAN ( Grayson , 356 W. Huron St. ) : German is a Russian in his mid-40s who worked as a graphic designer before coming to America five years ago . Some of his still-lifes retain the simplicity and directness of poster design , exerting their appeal immediately despite a subtle handling of surface . In this , they are closer to German ' s figure studies than to his many seascapes . The latter are small-scale evocations of the atmosphere favored by J.M.W. Turner . Highly romantic in feeling , they nonetheless do not go overboard with a Byronesque impulse , being held in check both by scale and quaint forms reminiscent of Lyonel Feininger ' s cartoonish tugboats . Here , especially , German ' s layers of oil on paper produce luscious results . The pleasure one receives is from so persuasive an atomization of nature conveyed through so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
