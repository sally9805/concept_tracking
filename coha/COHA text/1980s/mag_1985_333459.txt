The middle-aged businessman , a scion of one of El Salvador 's oldest families , was impatient . He had been waiting a day and a half for his plantation foreman to report the results of a highly sensitive negotiation . Finally , the telephone rang with the news . The foreman had got in touch with El Salvador 's Marxist-led guerrillas to discuss wages for the migrant farm laborers whom the cafetalero needed during the 2 1/2-month coffee harvest . The guerrillas ' demand on behalf of the workers : about $4 for each 100 lbs . of coffee beans picked , plus food and medical care . The rebels also wanted a slice of the harvest action : a " tip " of about $5 for each 500 lbs . of beans . The alternative to a settlement was a return to the kind of armed harassment of the harvest that has been commonplace in El Salvador in past years . <P> Nonetheless , the businessman balked . " We ca n't afford that , " he told the foreman . " The best we can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more days of secretive telephone calls , a deal was finally struck . The grower would pay his laborers $3.63 per 100 lbs. ; the workers would bring their own lunch . The guerrillas , members of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front ( F.M.L.N. ) , would receive $500 for the entire harvest . In return , the grower would have the services of all the workers he needed for the lengthy harvest season , and coffee trucks would roll unmolested from his plantations to processing and storage mills . <P> Similar under-the-table transactions have been taking place in recent weeks all over central and eastern El Salvador as the harvest of the country 's biggest cash crop got under way . Despite the bitter enmity between Salvadoran landowners and the Liberation Front , the coffee harvest is a time when the two sides find good use for each other . This year the interdependence appears to be greater than ever . Says a lawyer in the central department of Usulutan : " Everybody is making deals with the guerrillas . " The reason , he explains , is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accepted . The situation in El Salvador has moved from a strictly military war to a more mature political battle . " <P> Indeed , it is the damage done by El Salvador 's five-year civil war that has produced the strange bedfellows . Traditionally , coffee has provided more than 50% of the country 's export revenues . It still does , but since 1980 income from coffee has shrunk , from more than $615 million to $403 million . This year bountiful rains promise a slight reversal of the trend . At current world prices , the Salvadoran coffee harvest could bring in as much as $410 million in desperately needed foreign exchange . Because roughly 25% of the crop is grown in areas contested or controlled by the guerrillas , more and more landowners have come to see the virtue of cooperating with their enemies , whose right to represent local workers may be debatable , but whose destructive capability is not . The government of President Jose Napoleon Duarte , currently preparing for another round of peace talks with the rebels , seems to be ignoring the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a successful coffee harvest is in the greater national interest .
