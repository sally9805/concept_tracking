Excerpted from Across The Board , the magazine of the Conference Board in New York . Distributed by Words by Wire . The training film opens with a conservatively dressed man , an elastic- faced mime with doleful eyes and eyebrows that bounce like rubber balls , approaching a kimono-clad housewife in front of her home in a conservative Tokyo suburb . He asks for a few minutes of her time . She politely tells him to buzz off . The scene depicts a routine rejection for a foot soldier in Japan ' s huge army of door-to-door automobile salesmen . More than 75 percent of the new cars purchased in Japan are sold by men ( and a handful of women ) who make their living thumping thresholds and pounding on portals . The country ' s automobile manufacturers reaped $26 billion from door-to-door sales of new cars in 1984 . This training film is one of many instructional aids produced by Tokyo Toyopet  --  the capital city division of the giant Toyota Motor Sales Co . Ltd.  --  to help prepare salesmen for some of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A 31-year-old company , Tokyo Toyopet employs some 1 , 200 salesmen who regularly and methodically circulate among the city ' s 11. 5 million residents , peddling cars as fervently as the Fuller Brush Man hustles lint remover or the Avon Lady pushes perfume . They must be effective . Tokyo Toyopet is the top dealer among 318 Toyota sales companies around Japan , signing contracts for almost 71 , 000 new cars in 1983 and more than 75 , 000 in 1984 . Although door-to-door selling may appear a haphazard way to do business , Tokyo Toyopet has it down to a science . The best time to hit a potential new- car buyer , the company judges , is just after his car has completed its " shaken , " a mandatory inspection when the auto is three years old . " We have found that that is when owners are most likely to make a decision about a new car , " says Tokyo Toyopet spokesman Shoichi Miyata . " That is the time they are most prone to say they are thinking about trading in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " list and a computer printout of all Toyota owners , a Tokyo Toyopet salesman starts knocking on doors . Each salesman has a rigidly defined area of responsibility , its size depending upon population density . In central Tokyo , it may be only a square block . Lugging a black sample case in the best Willie Loman tradition , a Tokyo Toyopet salesman , wearing the ubiquitous dark suit and a big smile , visits some 30 households a day . ( An experienced one has to make only half that number of calls ; he knows his area better and is more familiar with his potential customers ' habits . ) If no one is home , the salesman doesn ' t hesitate to call on the potential buyer at his workplace  --  a practice apparently condoned by Japanese employers . The salesman can expect a warm reception from a Toyota owner . Brand loyalty is extremely high in Japan , and Tokyo Toyopet estimates that 90 percent of Toyota drivers stick with the company when buying new vehicles . Among non-Toyota owners , Miyata says , only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The first thing a salesman proposes , if the door isn ' t slammed politely in his face , is an evaluation of the customer ' s car  --  the at-home equivalent of driving to a dealer for a trade estimate . Tokyo Toyopet has found that one out of 10 will accept the offer ; three of 10 who do will decide to upgrade . Then , from a satchel crammed with catalogues , brochures , insurance questionnaires and installment-payment forms , the salesman probably will proffer for the customer ' s inspection a well-made , toy-size model on one of the popular new cars . To the miniature-conscious Japanese , this is better than a visit to the showroom . A good salesperson will sell 200 cars a year this way  --  almost four a week  --  and will make about $45 , 000 . A relative neophyte , perhaps a bright young salesperson with about three years experience , can expect to bring home almost $17 , 000 , roughly as much as a corporate junior executive with three times as much tenure . The spectacular success of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Toyopet runs a spot , for example , it doesn ' t urge potential new buyers to hurry down to the showroom to slam the doors and kick the tires on the latest models . Be patient , the company suggests . A salesman , or one of the company ' s 10 saleswomen , will be along by and by . Radio is overwhelmingly the advertising medium of Tokyo Toyopet ' s choice . Newspapers and magazines are impractical because they circulate nationally and Tokyo Toyopet sells only in Tokyo . Television is too expensive . That leaves radio , which has the additional benefit of being exceedingly popular . Listening to the car radio is a favorite pastime in Tokyo ' s horrible traffic jams . What better opportunity , car manufacturers reckon , to get a potential customer thinking about trading in his old , uncomfortable vehicle ? Automobile advertisements in Japan are not as product-oriented as they are in this country . " Our intention is not to sell cars as such , but to sell the company image , " Miyata says . " Our campaigns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not at attracting customers to the showrooms . " Miyata hints , however , that this policy is subject to revision , or at least modification . More Japanese women , like their counterparts in the West , are working away from the home , and there often is no one to answer when the salesman comes knocking . But cars are only part of it . In Japan , everything is sold door-to-door . The Yano Research Institute estimates that direct sales , excluding automobiles , totaled $13 billion in 1984 . Only the United States has greater volume . If the current rate of growth continues , door-to-door sales in Japan will rise by 26 percent in 1985 , to $17 billion . In the land of the rising sun , door-to-door sales people have whatever you want . Need a new broom ? Help will come before the dust settles . Wondering what to do with your paycheck ? A representative from one of the city ' s numerous banks will gladly accept a deposit . Feeling the urge to invest in the stock market ? A securities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Insurance ? You ' re covered . A condo ? You can move in next week . CAPTION : ILLUSTRATION : Illustration by John Schmelzer . Illustration ILLUSTRATION <>
