For Jennifer Dawn Levin and Robert E. Chambers Jr. , life was private schools , fancy apartments , foreign vacations and underage drinking at a preppy hangout called Dorrian ' s Red Hand . But for Mr. Chambers , it was also unemployment , academic futility and signs of cocaine abuse. // The two had known each other for about two months and dated several times , the police said , before they met early Tuesday morning at Dorrian ' s Red Hand , at 300 East 84th Street . The owner , Jack Dorrian , said he knew both as regulars. // // Arrived Separately , Left Together // Mr. Chambers and Miss Levin each had arrived with a separate group of friends , but they left together at 4 : 30 A.M. , exchanging " boy-girl talk " as they walked toward Central Park , the police said . It was there , the police believe , that she was killed. // Less than two hours later , a passer-by found Miss Levin ' s body - strangled with her bra and apparently sexually abused , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind the Metropolitan Museum of Art . An autopsy yesterday confirmed that she was strangled , and further tests were to be conducted today. // Early this morning , Mr. Chambers was arraigned on a charge of second-degree murder. // The police picked up Mr. Chambers at his East 90th Street apartment Tuesday afternoon and brought him to the Central Park Precinct for questioning . Mr. Chambers had scratches on his face that the police said he sustained in a struggle with Miss Levin. // Mr. Chambers ' s lawyer , Jack Littman , entered a plea of not guilty at the arraignment early this morning in Manhattan Criminal Court before Judge Richard Lowe 3d. // Mr. Littman told the court that Miss Levin had sought out Mr. Chambers in the bar and that they had had a prior relationship . " But that night she was the one who was the agressor , " he said. // He asked that bail for Mr. Chambers be waived , but Judge Lowe denied the request and ordered Mr. Chambers remanded to the city jail. // The charge against Mr. Chambers was presented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who told the court that Miss Levin had bite marks on both her face and breast and that Mr. Chambers had " lied to the police to protect himself. " // Mr. Schwartz said Mr. Chambers had thought out a story and then changed it when he realized it was not working . <> <> ' An Accident ? ' - ' Yes ' // Judge Lowe , in an exchange with Mr. Littman , asked the defense attorney , " Are you saying this was an accident ? " " Yes , your honor , " said Mr. Littman . " At the hands of the defendant ? " asked the judge . " Yes , your honor , a tragic accident . " During the arraignment , Mr. Chambers wept . His father and mother sat quietly behind him. // Mr. Littman said Mr. Chambers had been about 100 feet from the body of Miss Levin when the police arrived in the park Tuesday morning . But he said Mr. Chambers left because he was in a state of confusion. // The details of both Mr. Chambers ' s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - details that contradicted Mr. Chambers ' s golden-boy image and revealed a naivete beneath Miss Levin ' s worldly exterior. // Mr. Chambers , in the recollection of friends , possessed charisma and mature good looks rare for a 19-year-old . He stood 6 feet 4 inches tall , weighed 220 pounds and was a gifted athlete , who had played for three years on the soccer team at York Preparatory School , 116 East 85th Street. // " Nothing less than total success , " said the caption beneath Mr. Chambers ' s photograph in his yearbook . <> <> A Way With Women // Mr. Chambers had a particular way with young women . Mr. Dorrian , the bar owner , said : " He didn ' t have to chase girls . They chased him. " // Mr. Chambers , an only child , lived with his mother in an apartment in a five-story town house at 11 East 90th Street , next to the former Andrew Carnegie mansion , now the Cooper-Hewitt Museum .

" Discipline is still the main theme , " Mrs. Chambers was quoted as saying . " The Greys teaches what society should be about , the niceties of life . " <> <> ' Boss Other People Around ' // Robert , then 14 , added : " The best part is becoming an officer . Then you get to boss other people around . That ' s a whole lot better than taking orders. " // But self-discipline , it appears , was something Mr. Chambers lacked . If anything , he seemed to try to coast on his good looks and charm - and , in academic settings , not always with success. // " He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " recalled Ronald P. Stewart , the York headmaster , in an interview yesterday . A friend from York , Larry J. Greer , said : " He could have been captain of the soccer team , but he was lackadaisical . He was an underachiever. " // Before attending York , Mr. Chambers had lasted one year at the Choate School in Wallingford , Conn. , and less than one semester at the Browning School at 52 East 62d Street in Manhattan . The details of his withdrawal from each school remain unclear . <> <> Dropped Out of College // Mr. Chambers entered Boston University in the fall of 1984 , but dropped out at the end of one semester , university records show .

But otherwise , the police said , he was unemployed. // Still , Mr. Chambers had enough money to drink and flirt " five or six nights a week " at Dorrian ' s Red Hand , Mr. Dorrian said. // The bar owner described Mr. Chambers as " the nicest kid you ' d want to meet , " someone who would help calm rowdy customers and pick up litter or broken glass from the floor . But he added that Mr. Chambers had " a drug problem " and had gone to treatment program in Michigan about three months ago . <> <> A Cheerful Worker // " We hear rumors that at one time he did have a cocaine problem , " said the deputy police commissioner for public information , Alice T. McGillion . " We ' re pretty sure it ' s true . " Miss Levin , meanwhile , was a young woman who " was always happy , " said Eric Barger , the manager of Flutie ' s Pier 17 , the restaurant in the South Street Seaport where she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , from the time I hired her , did I ever see her come to work with anything but a smile , " he said. // Mr. Barger also described her as a hard , willing worker . On Liberty Weekend , for instance , Miss Levin helped unload a tractor-trailer filled with extra beer and food for the anticipated mob of customers . <> <> Boyfriend Gone for the Summer // " She was a lovely , lovely little girl , " Mr. Dorrian said . He said Miss Levin ' s regular boyfriend , whom he recalled only as " Brock , " was vacationing in Europe this summer .

Officials at the Baldwin School refused several requests to be interviewed yesterday. // Miss Levin ' s father , Steven , said yesterday that his daughter was " always the straight kid of her crowd " and that " maybe she was too trusting . " Her stepmother , Arlene Levin , added that the young woman might even have been considered " a prude. " // Still , Mr. Levin acknowledged that his daughter " liked to go out at night . " Mr. Dorrian said she came into his bar two or three times a week . And amid Miss Levin ' s belongings at the murder scene , the police found a learner ' s driving permit giving her age as 22. // It had been her passport into Dorrian ' s Red Hand. //
