Ilere 's a question I 've had for a long Antique high-wheel bicycle was called an " ordinary . " time and never known who to ask . It 's about those enormous front wheel bikes from the old days . What was the purpose of them ? They seem dangerous , so I could never figure out why the wheel had to be so very big . Also , did they have a special name ? Henry Jackson , Oak Park A ? The first version of the bicycle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back wheel was the velocipede . It was built in 1861 by Pierre and Ernest Michaux in Paris . Since there were no gears , one revolu. tion of the pedals provided one complete turn of the front wheel . Thus , the bigger the front wheel , the faster the bicyclist could travel without increasing pedaling speed . An Englishman , James Starley , went even further with his Ariel model introduced in 1871 . The front wheel was bigger , the back wheel was smaller , and an internal gear allowed one turn of of the pedals to provide two revolutions of the front wheel . This version was dubbed the " ordinary . " Despite the obvious hazards , the ordinary remained the most popular model until the introduction of a practical chain-driven rear wheel model in 1885 . This was the Rover safety bicycle produced by John K. Starley , a nephew of James Starley . The big wheel ordinary did n't stand a chance against the faster and easierto-ride safety bicycle . Q ?
