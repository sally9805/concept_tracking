But plastic heart recipient Barney Clark still faces problems <P> The patient was weak , exhausted , his face looking almost pained when it flashed onto the television screen , and his comments were haltingly slow . But it was not the mechanical heart that troubled Barney Clark as he gave his first public interview since his historic operation on Dec. 1 . " The heart has pumped right along . It does n't bother me at all , " he told his surgeon , Dr. William DeVries , who conducted the session on videotape at the University of Utah Medical Center . Instead , it was his lungs , permanently damaged by years of poor circulation , that kept Clark rasping throughout the 2-minute conversation . The obvious strain on the former Seattle dentist raised one question , but Clark had no doubt about the answer : " It is worth it . " He said he would advise other artificial-heart candidates to go ahead with the procedure , " if the alternative is they either die or have it done . " He added , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be able to help people . " <P> Clark , however , was not always so sure that the pleasure he felt in making a contribution to medicine outweighed his pain . " There were times when he wanted to die , " DeVries admitted to reporters . Questions about Clark 's mental state were answered definitively for the first time last week by Dr. Claudia Berenson , a psychiatrist who served on the hospital panel that selected Clark as the first artificial-heart recipient and who has been following his case ever since . <P> Clark had suffered seizures one week after the heart was implanted and lapsed into what Berenson termed " acute brain syndrome , " characterized by " delirium , decreased alertness , severe memory loss and confusion . " The condition , she believed , was organic rather than emotional , perhaps brought on by the sudden increase in blood supply to a brain " that had become used to low cardiac output . " When questioned , Clark would " look perplexed , " Berenson said . " Sometimes he would not know he had had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appeared too discouraged to try to speak , but at times he was lucid enough to be painfully aware of his condition . " My mind is shot , " he told Berenson more than once . <P> Then late last month there was a sudden turnaround . Returning from a brief business trip , Berenson met Clark 's wife Una Loy in the hospital corridor and was told , " Barney is great . He is a totally different person . " Berenson quickly confirmed this for herself . " He started talking to me like I was a psychiatrist . It was a 20-minute monologue . " Now , she said , Clark is " lucid and rational . He wants to participate in his recovery . " <P> Toward this end , Clark is eating a varied diet and gradually increasing his activity . His meals include bacon and eggs , potatoes and gravy , vegetables and lemon pie , quite a change since January , when he was forbidden to taste the heart-shaped chocolate cake that was baked for his 62nd birthday . Clark , who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and enjoys reading the letters that have arrived by the thousands . He was particularly pleased when a Seattle hospital named a coronary wing after him . " Just think , " he said dryly , " I did n't have to die to get it . "
