Consumer groups stepped up their pressure yesterday for banks to lower credit card interest rates . In news conferences in six cities , leaders of a coalition of major consumer groups called for consumers to " fight and switch " by discarding high-interest credit cards and substituting credit cards from other banks . " We think the big banks have just been plain greedy , " said David Berliner , assistant director of Consumers Union , based in Mount Vernon , N.Y. He charged that most banks have failed to lower their rates on credit cards even though the cost of funds is down dramatically . " If bankers ran gas stations , we ' d still be paying $1. 40 per gallon , " said Neil Fogarty , president of the Consumers League of New Jersey . Joining in the " fight and switch " coalition were the Washington , D.C.-based groups Consumer Federation of America , Bankcard Holders of America , Public Citizen and the National Consumers League . Also in the coalition are many state and local consumer groups . For special criticism , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one-fourth of the nation ' s credit cards . The six were New York-based Citibank , which charges 19. 8% interest on credit card balances ; San Francisco-based Bank of America , 19. 8% ; New York-based Chase Manhattan Bank , currently 19. 8% but dropping to 17. 5% on Feb. 1 ; New York-based Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co. , 17. 8% ; Chicago-based First National Bank of Chicago , 19. 8% ; and New York-based Chemical Bank , 19. 5% . In contrast to those rates , Gary Serota , president of Bankcard Holders , said that his group publishes a list of some 50 banks across the country with credit card interest rates of 16. 5% or less . The banks are grouped by region . Some , but not all of them , issue credit cards nationwide . In the most recent survey of 200 banks by Bank Credit Card Observer , the best interest rates available from banks that offer cards nationwide were from three Arkansas banks  --  Union National Bank in Little Rock , Simmons First National Bank in Pine Bluff , and Twin City Bank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 5% , in keeping with an Arkansas law that limits credit card interest rates to five percentage points above the Federal Reserve ' s discount rate . Republic National Bank in Miami was charging 14% , and Society National Bank in Cleveland was charging 14. 05% . Representatives for the six criticized banks said that the rates charged are appropriate . " The cost of funds is less important for credit cards than it is for other loans , " said a representative for Chase Manhattan . " You ' re dealing with millions of small transactions , each of which must be processed separately . " The Chase representative also noted that its premium cards will soon carry an interest rate of 16. 5% , and that all of its cards offer " a substantial number of enhancements , " such as travel rebates , collision insurance on rental cars and waiver of the annual fee when charges exceed a threshold amount . Such enhancements didn ' t seem to carry much weight with the consumer-group leaders . Banks " refuse to compete on the basis of price " in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he charged , they compete on the basis of " unnecessary perks " such as " luggage tags or the chance to use a health club in Singapore when you travel . " A representative for Chemical Bank said , " We are currently conducting a review of our pricing structure . We will be innovative in responding to consumer needs . " A Manufacturers Hanover spokesman said , " We were the first of the major banks to drop our rates , from 19. 8% to 17. 8% in 1985 . " That step was taken to reflect a decline in the cost of funds , he said , and has been been well-received by consumers . Manufacturers Hanover has issued more than one million credit cards since September 1985 , he said . A Citibank spokeswoman said only , " We believe our cards provide value and choice to the consumer . " A spokesman for First National Bank of Chicago said the bank believes its fee structure is appropriate , " given the high costs associated with providing this convenient form of consumer credit . " A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its credit card interest rate is " below that of other major banks in California , and competitive with savings and loans that offer an equal grace , or interest-free , period . " In a related development , the treasurer-elect of Illinois , Jerome Cosentino , recently threatened to withdraw state business from First National Bank of Chicago , a unit of First Chicago Corp. , because he considered First Chicago ' s 19. 8% interest rate on credit cards too high . As reported last Friday , First Chicago has moved to expand its credit card operations by buying a Delaware bank , Beneficial National Bank USA of Wilmington , from Beneficial Corp . Delaware doesn ' t regulate interest rates or annual fees on credit cards . Credit : Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal
