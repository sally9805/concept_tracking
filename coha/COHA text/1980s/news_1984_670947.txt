The case centers on a confessed killer-for-hire who has named his accomplices and his employers , according to the prosecutor , Charles F. Marsland Jr . Mr. Marsland will not identify any of those he hopes to prosecute , either in the murder inquiry or in the wide-ranging campaign against organized crime that has been his principal interest since he took office as Honolulu city- county prosecutor in 1980. // But the attorney of Larry Mehau , a friend and political supporter of the Governor , said that he expected his client to be indicted at some point and that the evidence would be perjured . The attorney , David Schutter , has accused Mr. Marsland of carrying out a " political vendetta " against Mr. Ariyoshi and Mr. Mehau. // Governor Ariyoshi must step down in two years , when his term ends , and his political heirs could suffer considerable damage if his opponents in the current controversy prevail. // // Political Fortunes at Stake // // On the other side , Mr. Marsland has proved to be one of a handful of successful Republican campaigners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bring his case to a successful conclusion , his political fortunes and those of his party could suffer. // Mr. Schutter said last week , " Since the day Marsland took over the prosecutor ' s office , the whole damned thing has been an orchestrated campaign against Ariyoshi and Mehau. " // Mr. Mehau has a libel suit pending against a member of the prosecutor ' s staff , a newspaperman who , before going to work for Mr. Marsland , labeled Mr. Mehau " godfather " of organized crime in Hawaii . Mr. Mehau faces misdemeanor charges over reporting of his contributions to the 1982 Ariyoshi campaign. // Mr. Marsland , who has frequently spoken of an " Ariyoshi-Mehau machine , " emphatically denies any suggestion of overzealousness. // In one of his few statements on the investigation , Governor Ariyoshi said in an interview that he and Mr. Mehau had been friends for more than 30 years but that Mr. Mehau had never asked favors of the Governor . <> <> Denial by Governor // // As for the reference to an " Ariyoshi- Mehau machine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am concerned , there has been a lot of loose talk. " // Asked about the description of Mr. Mehau as a " godfather , " Mr. Ariyoshi said : " I do not know if he is or is not . I know of nothing he has done of a criminal nature. " // At the center of the dispute is Ronald Ching , whom the authorities call a paid killer for organized crime and who , in a plea-bargain agreement , has confessed to four murders , including that of Mr. Marsland ' s son. // The prosecutor ' s son , Charles F. Marsland 3d , was 19 years old when he was shot on April 17 , 1975. // " I know why Chuckers was killed , " Mr. Marsland said . " I know all the people involved in it . " Asked if he had evidence for prosecution , he replied , " Yes . " <> <> Confession to Four Murders // // In a court appearance July 31 , Mr. Ching pleaded guilty to murdering the younger Marsland and three others. // Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone else , of State Senator Larry Kuriyama on the night of Oct. 23 , 1970 . In 1975 , Fred Ruis , a dairy farmer and another client of Mr. Schutter , was acquitted of a charge that he had hired someone to murder the Senator . Mr. Ruis has since died. // The other victims Mr. Ching identified in court were Robert Fukumoto , shot to death in a Honolulu bar on May 20 , 1980 ; and Arthur K. Baker , a Drug Enforcement Administration informant who was dragged from a bar , driven to a beach and buried alive in 1978. // Official sources said Mr. Baker had been an important informant in a Federal drug investigation , " Operation Firebird , " in the late 1970 ' s . The sources said he was murdered a month after the beginning of the investigation , which produced no indictments. // Mr. Ching had been brought here from a Federal prison on the mainland , where he was serving a 21-year sentence for narcotics and firearms law violations , to be arraigned in the murder of Mr. Baker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guilty to the four murder charges . <> <> Plea-Bargain Agreement Sealed // // The terms of Mr. Ching ' s plea-bargain agreement have been sealed by court order . Mr. Schutter , the attorney for Mr. Mehau , said he had been told that Mr. Ching would receive 20 years in prison ; Mr. Ching ' s lawyer predicted that his client would be free in 1995. // Mr. Marsland , asked how he felt about Mr. Ching , replied : // " The natural desire for revenge runs pretty heavy . You have to set it aside and trade that for the evidence that gets the guy who does the hits . That guy leads you to the people who run organized crime here . Ching is on the lower end of the ladder . If you want to leave it at the street level , he ' s the guy . I ' d rather take it all the way up to the people who run organized crime in the state.

" // Mr. Schutter said the prosecutor ' s office was carrying out a " political vendetta " against Mr. Mehau and Governor Ariyoshi . Mr. Schutter characterized the prosecutor ' s office as " a whole cabal of people " who are " carried away in their own comic strip beliefs . " " Everybody who has been arrested in the last two years for anything remotely resembling underworld activity has been offered a deal if they testified Larry Mehau has done anything , " said Mr. Schutter . He said he had a list of 12 people who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // Terming such statements " asinine , " Mr. Marsland said of the lawsuit : " Any suggestion that we knew there was evidence to clear Cyril Kahale before we brought charges or that we told him what to say or in any way attempted to change his testimony is a lie. " // Mr. Schutter said that on his advice Mr. Mehau would not grant interviews. // Most of the legal actions arising from the organized-crime investigation have involved native Hawaiians . Henry Huihui , who became a protected Federal witness earlier this year , is part Hawaiian ; Mr. Ching is Chinese- Hawaiian ; Mr. Kahale is Hawaiian. // Mr. Mehau , who is believed by his attorney to be a target of the investigation , is also Hawaiian. // Mr. Schutter represents Mr. Mehau in a $50 million libel suit against Rick Reed , Mr. Marsland ' s administrative assistant . The suit stems from a 1977 article in The Valley Isle , a Maui newspaper that Mr. Reed ran. // The article called Mr. Mehau the " godfather " of organized crime in Hawaii and purported to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disappeared while riding surfboards. // " I think Rick Reed is operating entirely from evil motives , " Mr. Schutter said . " He has fooled Chuck Marsland to a large extent . " <> <> ' Cabal ' Charged by Lawyer // // The lawyer also said that Don Carstensen , chief of the prosecutor ' s organized crime unit , was part of the " cabal. " // Mr. Reed denied the charge , and Mr. Carstensen , who was a Honolulu police officer before joining the prosecutor ' s staff , called it " absurd . " Both said pending prosecution had prevented them from giving full responses. // Mr. Marsland said , " I ' m not led around by anybody , including Mr. Schutter and his clients , and I ' m not going to be pushed around by them . " He said he had hired Mr. Carstensen and Mr. Reed because they were knowledgeable about organized crime , which has been his target since he decided to run for the prosecutor ' s office. // Mr. Marsland was a lawyer in the Honolulu corporation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the city , when his son was murdered . <> <> Sought Transfer to Criminal Work // // He requested transfer to criminal work in the prosecutor ' s office . He had earlier worked in a crime unit of the Massachusetts attorney general ' s office. // In 1980 , he ran for a four-year term as prosecutor , and he is seeking re- election this year. // The public record shows a friendly relationship between Governor Ariyoshi and Mr. Mehau. // Mr. Mehau ' s properties include an interest in Hawaii Protective Association Ltd. , a guard service that has a state contract to provide security at Hawaii ' s airports. // In 1980 Burns International Security Services Inc. underbid the Mehau company for that contract . But state officials disallowed the Burns bid on a technicality and awarded the contract to Mr. Mehau ' s concern . <> <> Governor Denies Charge // In reaction to widespread speculation that he had exercised his influence in Mr. Mehau ' s behalf during the contract negotiations , the Governor said in the interview that this was not so . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ qualify to bid because it was a new corporate entity spun off from a parent and had not yet been licensed on its own. // Mr. Ariyoshi said he had been friendly with Mr. Mehau since the 1950 ' s , when Mr. Mehau was a Honolulu police officer and Mr. Ariyoshi was a young criminal lawyer . " The judges then spoke of him as an honest , tough police officer , and he was perceived that way by criminals as well , " Governor Ariyoshi said. // The misdemeanor election law violations Mr. Mehau faces grew out of a Honolulu grand jury inquiry in which Mr. Mehau refused to answer questions on the ground of possible self-incrimination. // The grand jury forwarded its findings to the Hawaii Campaign Spending Commission . The commission discarded 10 suggested charges but asked Mr. Marsland to prosecute two charges related to expenses of entertainers who flew to a rally for Mr. Ariyoshi in October 1982 . <> <> ' A Sick , Evil Joke ' // // Mr. Schutter asserted that the violations were only technical , if they existed at all , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sick , evil joke , " he said. // Mr. Marsland said : " Mr. Mehau was subpeonaed to that grand jury and took the Fifth on Mr. Schutter ' s advice . He could have clarified some of these matters if he had cared to testify. " // Mr. Mehau is a native of Hilo and was a state champion summo wrestler . In 1963 he retired from the Honolulu Police Department because of a hand injury and moved back to Hawaii Island to a ranch. // He served eight years as a member of the Hawaii Board of Land and Natural Resources , appointed first by Gov . John A. Burns , now deceased , and then by Governor Ariyoshi. // Mr. Mehau is described by those who know him as physically powerful , weighing about 300 pounds and standing about 6 feet tall . He is said to have strong " mana , " a native Hawaiian term equivalent to " aura " or " presence. " // " Of course Larry knows a lot of criminals , " Mr. Schutter said .
