txt Q ? I am writing about a complaint our school system and a number of the faculty have about Dr. Ed Plno , head of the International Graduate School of Education in Parker , Colo . This school has been in existence for at least 10 years and offered individuals around the country the opportunity to take courses for college credit on their own campuses . Many of our instructors have taken courses through the International Graduate ' School of Education but , unfortunately , some things have changed that have caused us severe prohlems . The school has apparently gone out of business . Many of our teachers paid for and took a course last fall but never received transcripts , The course was canceled and no refunds were sent . We have repeatedly sent Dr. Pine letters with no response . His post office box has evidently been closed . Our staff members have a lot of money tied up in graduate work which they took . Can you help ? Gene Schmidt , superintendent , North Boone Community Unit Schools , . District No. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outlook does n't look good . We forwarded your letter to Dorothy Smith , the postmaster in Parker . " Several months ago , " Smith told us , " Pino was indicted for fraud regarding the Social Security System . We do not know what has happened to him but read in the papers that he was found guilty on several counts . Before that , he stopped picking up his mail ( at his post office box ) and , after the rent became due , never renewed It . Therefore , we returned all mail and closed the box. ? Pino 's residence is also in Parker but certified letters addressed to him there are not picked up either .

" Q ? Last week f mailed a card to a South Side address . The card was returned by the post office stamped " no such street . " I checked the address , although I have been sending snail to that address for years . It was correct , so I wrote a note saying that was the right address , and stapled it on the envelope . The card came back again . So I had to pot it in another envelope , plea another 15-cent stamp . I am ' mailing it again and hope it does n't come back . I think with the cost of stamps that I should get better service . Mrs. A. IL , South Rockwell Street ' A ?

When she attached a note to it and remailed the letter , it was returned again because the note had fallen off . " Q ? Each day The Tribune publishes the time of sunrise and sunset for Chicago .
