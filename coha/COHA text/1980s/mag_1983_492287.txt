// The gold rush of ' 49 was but a Sunday afternoon stroll in the park compared to the upcoming gold , silver and bronze rush of ' 84 for medals at the Los Angeles Olym  --  pics . The hurdles on the road to the Olympics are many . For most ath  --  letes blood , sweat and tears is just a starter , but for those who are burn  --  ing with Olympic fever , no hurdle is too great to overcome . Sonic of the following athletes will qualify for the American team . Others may fail . Some will be back again in ' 88 , but for others it is their final oppor  --  tunity to satisfy the dream of stand  --  ing in the winners ' circle . Rowdy Gaines : 1980 's Loss In line for enough medals at the 1980 Moscow Olympics to make him the most renowned swimmer since Mark Spitz , Ambrose ( Rowdy ) Gaines saw his hopes go down the drain with the American boycott . Along with them went his concen ? tration and boyish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would actually stick to it , " says this Auburn University gradu ate from Winter Haven , Florida . " I felt cheated , oppressed and unwant ed . I still think the boycott was a stupid decision ; it proved nothing . " Rowdy Gaines , at 24 , continues to dream his Olympic dream . " Some  --  times I wonder if I 'm getting too old , burned out . 1 think about all my colleagues who did n't have a chance to swim and turned to earning a living , and I ask myself if I 'm not wasting my time . But swim  --  ming is what I want to do the most . " Having used up his college eligibility , Rowdy still trains with coach Richard Quick at the University of Texas . Here , in the pool at Austin , is where he established his world rec  --  ords in both the 100- and 200-meter freestyle events . And if this training results in victories over the American competition of Chris Cavan  --  augh and Rich Saeger in the U.S. Trials , June @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jorg Woithe of East Germany and Michael Gross of West Germany , top contenders in the Olympics . " It 's been tough the last three years , " says Rowdy . We ' older ' swimmers were sup  --  posed to have reached our peaks in 1980 . Hopefully , that wo n't turn out to be true . " Mary T. Meagher 's Postponed Dream When Soviet military troops rumbled into Afghanistan in 1979 , the reverberations jarred the life 's dream of I5-year-old Mary Terstegge Meagher of Louisville , Kentucky . Mary T. , as she is known by her colleagues , became one of the athletic-career casualties of Presi  --  dent Jimmy Carter 's retaliatory American boycott of the 1980 Olympic Games in Moscow . " The Olympics had always been my dream , " sighs this dedicated young swimmer who , as a high schooler , had followed her swim  --  ming coach from Louisville to Cin  --  cinnati to continue her training . " And that is what they have re  --  mained  --  only a dream . " Bitterly disappointed , she had no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when an Associated Press reporter phoned with the results of the Olympic swimming competition and told her she could have beaten their times  --  and wanted to know how she felt about that . " I felt like hanging up the phone and crying , " she con  --  fesses . In fact , Mary T. nearly quit swimming altogether . But she decided to plunge ahead for the 1984 Olympics . And her " comeback " has already made quite a splash . She has won an NCAA championship , set world records in both the 100- and 200-meter butterfly events and has emerged as one of America 's brightest hopes for ending the domination of East Germany in her sport . " My American rivals are the ones to consider first , " says Mary T. , looking ahead to the Olympic trials next June 25-30 at Indianapolis . " Not having done my best times in a couple of years , I feel some  --  what threatened by the new Mary Lou Kelton 's gymnastic talent has , at age 12 , earned her the No. 1 senior-class @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she 's still improving . comers . But with dedication and plenty of hard work I think I can come back just fine . " It 's a long way from the coal-min  --  ing community of Fairmont , West Virginia , to Texas . But Mary Lou Retton , a ninth-grader at Houston 's Northland Christian School ( having left at home her parents , three brothers and sister Shari  --  an All-American gymnast at West Virginia University ) , has come much further in her training since the days she tried to emulate the Soviet crowdpleaser Nelli Kim at the local gym . Mary Lou 's Texas training , in fact , has unearthed a load of gymnastic talent that , at age 12 , has earned her the No . I senior-class ranking in the na  --  tion . And hopes are high that she will be one of the United States ' most productive natu  --  ral resources in the 1984 Olym  --  pic Games . Standing a scant 4 ' 10 " and weighing but 93 pounds , her performances combine speed and amazing acceleration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flip . Though she believes vaulting and floor ex  --  ercises to be her best events , an innovative maneuver on the uneven bars has already been named for her . Mary Lou credits her refinement to coach Bela Karolyi , the Roma  --  nian tutor responsible for the star  --  dom of Nadia Comenici in the 1976 Games , before he defected to Amer  --  ica in 1981 and opened a gymnasium in Houston . Here , under the eye of this technician , Mary Lou has im  --  proved her fundamentals , and here she has benefited from working out with fellow-student Dianne Dur  --  ham , ranked No. 2 . As to her earlier hopes of emulat  --  ing Nadia Comenici : " I really do n't want to be a carbon copy of Nadia , " she muses . " That 's a dream only for beginners . I would rather be a gymnast with my own style of per  --  formance . " With Mary Lou Retton , chances are good that coach Bela Karolyi will again strike Olympic gold  --  on  --  ly this time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gymnast Marie Roethlisberger 's tiny voice is a perfect fit for her 4 ' 9 " , 82-pound figure . She punc  --  tuates her speech with shy giggles , typical of an llth-grader . She could be the average student from New Trier High School in Northbrook , Illinois . But she is n't . As a result of spinal meningitis when she was two years old , Marie is totally deaf in one ear and has less than 50 percent hearing in the other ear . In addition , when she was still a toddler she had to relearn to walk , an ordeal she dismisses by recalling vaguely , " Oh , yeah , my mother told me about that . " Of her deafness she says , " It does n't bother me or affect my bal  --  ance . I can hear my floor music fine , but they have to turn up the volume a bit . " Marie also has asthma , which she says is not really worth mentioning . She does mention that " not too long ago I had Osgood-Schlatter disease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  but not anymore . I just have a continued on page 96 Forever Voyage continued from page 91 " But , captain , she's --  " Hanks stopped . He nodded . " Where she is . Yes , sir . " " Good . Now give me the cup . " The water was fresh . It came from the islands beneath the earth . It tasted of sleep . " One cup . She was right , Hanks , you know . Not to touch land ever again . She was right . But I brought her one cup of water from the land , and the land was in the water that touched her lips . One cup . Oh , if only --  " He shifted it in his rusted hands . A typhoon swarmed from nowhere , filling the cup . It was a black storm raging in a small place . He raised the cup and drank the typhoon . " Hanks ! " someone cried . But not he . The typhoon , storming , had gone , and him with it . The cup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning . The air was sweet and the wind steady . Hanks had worked half the night digging and half the morn filling . Now the work was done . The town minister helped and then stood back as Hanks jigsawed the final square of sod in place . Piece after piece he fit  --  ted neatly and tamped and joined . And on each piece , as Hanks had made certain , was the tall , the golden , the full , rich , ripe-grained wheat , as high as a ten-year-old boy . Hanks bent and put the last piece to rest . " No marker ? " asked the minister . " Oh , no , sir , and never will be one . " The minister started to pro  --  test ; then Hanks took his arm and walked him up the hill a ways . Then he turned and pointed back . They stook a long moment . The minister nodded at last , smiled quietly and said , " I see . I understand . " For there was just the ocean of wheat going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the wind , moving east and ever east beyond , and not a line or seam or rip  --  ple to show where the old man sank from sight . " It was a sea burial , " said the minister . " It was , " said Hanks . " As I promised . It was , indeed . " Then they turned and walked off along the hilly shore , saying nothing again until they reached and entered the creaking house . * Gold Rush of ' 84 continued from page 65 big , ugly bump under each knee . " Marie has been uprooting herself and following coaches , leaving both parents at home , since she was 12 years old . St. Louis and Omaha were her training sites before joining coach Bill Sands in Northbrook . Although her father Fred , a 1968 Olympian and current gymnastics coach at the University of Minne  --  sota , has been supportive , Marie in  --  sists that she has motivated herself . " It was something I wanted to do , " she says , " not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impressive tune-up came earlier this year . In the Coca-Cola International invitational at London , England , she won the all-around title . She swept all but one event . Choreography coach Donna Coz  --  zo warns Marie Roethlisberger : " She 's not your little **56;4514;TOOLONG . She 's an extreme  --  ly serious , intense girl who works about 30 to 36 hours a week . " While Marie may not have lived the life of a typical gymnastics pixy , there is a better-than-even chance she will become the darling of fans across the United States with no more than a bronze medal at Los Angeles . Bolden 's Bold Dash Born premature , asthmatic and clubfooted , Jeanette Bolden 's leap from life 's starting block was any thing but spectacular . For the first 4 of her 23 years this world-class sprinter was forced to wear corrective braces . Today , should you happen to be on Los Angeles ' Cen  --  tral Boulevard and spot the 27th Street Bakery , amid the aroma of sweet-potato pies you 'll find three generations of the Bolden family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I grew up with flour in my hair , " helps out by making deliveries . Although she uses an automobile , occasionally she could make better time on foot . Some track experts , in fact , give her an excellent chance of capturing the 100-meter gold medal in 1984 . If she does , she first must qualify in the Olympic 100 meter-dash trials next June in Los Angeles . Jeanette , un  --  daunted , has overcome even bigger obstacles . She not only had to wear corrective braces as a youngster , but several times during grade school she was rushed to the hospital with asthma attacks so severe her life was close to the finish line . At age 12 she was sent to Sunair Home For Asth continued on following page Gold Rush of ' 84 continued from page 96 matic Children at Tujunga , Califor  --  nia , for nine months . It was there that she had an intro  --  duction to sports  --  first swimming , then branching out to running . ? " The more I ran , the more people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " And in 1977 , after I beat some pretty good people , I no long  --  er had to hide anything . I just want  --  ed to keep on running . " Besides filling demands for inspi  --  rational talks and doing volunteer work for the American Lung Asso  --  ciation , Jeanette can also still be found occasionally delivering a freshly made sweet-potato pie for the family bakery . Currently , both boxers are work  --  ing out at the Olympic Training Center in Colorado Springs , Col  --  orado , as part of the U.S.A. Amateur Boxing Federation 's " Op  --  eration Gold . " Under this invita  --  tional program offering educational and athletic assistance to top American boxers , Clifford studies aerobics and speech at Pike 's Peak Community College ; Bernard is reg  --  istered at Palmer High . " If I make the team , " says Clif  --  ford , " I 'll give 100 percent to win the gold medal . Then Bernard wo n't have to cut his medal up to share with our father and mother . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they have done for us . " Thus the U.S. Olympic boxing team  --  whose trials are tentatively scheduled for next June 4-10 at Ft . Worth  --  appears to have a very gray future  --  and that is a bright forecast indeed . James Martin  --  For the Defense Although James Martin refuses to ingest sugar , white bread , soft drinks and red meat , opting instead for fresh vegetables , poultry and fish , there was a period when this nine-time judo All-American was n't so particular about what he put into his body . His rocky road to Los An  --  geles suffered a five-year detour through drug and alcohol abuse . Spurred by rebellion to the rigid workout schedule set by his father , a Grand Mas Not surprisingly , her fa vorite passage from the Bible , which she studies avidly , is found in the Book of Isaiah : " They that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength ; they shall mount up with wings like eagles ; they shall run , and not be weary ; and they shall walk , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Boynton Beach , Florida , raises beans , cucumbers , eggplant , peppers , squash and boxers . He planted the boxer crop eight years ago by hanging a potato sack filled with dirt and wet towels from a tree in the backyard and convincing his sons that it was a punching bag . Later , he drove them 170 miles a day to Miami for profes  --  sional training . Today , Theodore and Anna Mae Gray are har  --  vesting a crop of amateur champions . Last December , at the U.S.A. Amateur Boxing Federation championships in Indianapolis , the two oldest sons , Clifford , 21 , and Bernard , 20 , became the first brothers to cap  --  ture titles in the same meet , vaulting into Olym  --  pic contention.ters champion , James turned his back on judo at age 15 . But at 20 , suffer  --  ing ulcers and other symp  --  toms of a badly mistreat  --  ed body , he was given a shove  --  which also came from his father  --  right back into the sport . " My dad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nationals were a few days away , and he said he bet I could n't qualify . With no time to get in shape , 1 entered and won . " I was really lucky , be  --  ing in the right place at the right time , " he says . " But from it I got the idea that I could come back and go for the Olympics . " Now 29 years old , the San Gabriel , California , resident has his eye on America 's first Olympic gold medal in judo . And instead of dope , he is in  --  jecting himself with doses of confidence from coach Ben Chapman . James , with an unprec  --  edented six national titles to his credit , says a gold medal itself means noth  --  ing . " I 'd just like to be the first ever to capture a gold medal in judo for the United States , " he says . " Since judo became an Olympic sport in 1964 , Americans have won just two bronze medals .
