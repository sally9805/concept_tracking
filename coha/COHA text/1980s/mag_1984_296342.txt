A tragic gas leak offers a parable of industrial life <P> In Specimen Days Walt Whitman created a terrible picture of the proximity of human progress and human frailty by describing the U.S. Patent Office when it was used as a hospital during the Civil War . There the dead and dying soldiers lay on cots surrounded by the latest inventions of the day , high shelves packed with gleaming instruments devised to ensure the world 's safety and advancement . India provided some specimen days last week . On Monday the death toll was 410 . On Friday , more than 2,500 . By the weekend , numbers had no meaning any more , since no one could tell how many of the citizens of Bhopal who managed to survive the leaking toxic gas would eventually be counted among the dead . Something went very wrong at the Union Carbide pesticide plant . Human progress came up against human frailty . The air was poisoned , and the world gasped . <P> It was , in fact , the world 's tragedy that occurred in Bhopal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the industrialized society has created a shared fragility . The sources of enhancement are also the sources of fear and peril-all the chemical plants , nuclear power plants and other strangely shaped structures concocting potential salvation and destruction in remote and quiet places . The citizens of Bhopal lived near the Union Carbide plant because they sought to live there . The plant provided jobs , the pesticide more food . Bhopal was a modern parable of the risks and rewards originally engendered by the Industrial Revolution : Frankenstein 's wonder becoming Frankenstein 's monster . <P> Not that it was an abstract lesson that we watched all week , as mothers rocked blinded children in their arms and old men convulsed in their hospital beds . The pictures were all too real . More human frailty was on display than human progress . Odd how little it takes to pick up the facts involved in so sudden a catastrophe-to learn all about " methyl isocyanate , " and how the pressure built up in a storage tank too rapidly for the " scrubber " to neutralize the gas that escaped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in technology , as if we feel compelled to advance knowledge at the same time we experience shock and grief . But acquiring information also serves as a deflection of feeling . In the long run we remember people like ourselves , drowned in the air by an enemy that was supposed to be an ally . <P> If the world felt especially close to Bhopal last week , it may be because the world is Bhopal , a place where the occupational hazard is modern life . History teaches that there is no avoiding that hazard , and no point in trying ; one only trusts that the gods in the machines will give a good deal more than they take away . But the problem is not purely mystical either . If social advancement lies in something as lethal as methyl isocyanate , it only argues for handling with the greatest care . After this tragedy is out of the news , and the lawsuits are filed , and the dead cremated , things ought to be made considerably safer than they were before Bhopal . Human progress , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pesticide plant . - By Roger Rosenblatt
