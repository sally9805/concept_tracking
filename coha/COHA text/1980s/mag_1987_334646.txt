For centuries , historians and scientists have puzzled over the calamitous plague of Athens , which decimated the ancient city-state between 430 and 427 B.C. As vividly described by the historian Thucydides , himself a survivor of the illness , the plague attacked suddenly , causing " violent heats " in the head , inflammation of the eyes and throat , " reddish , livid " skin , extreme diarrhea and high fever . Historians agree that the epidemic , which killed the great statesman Pericles , contributed to the fall of Athens in the Peloponnesian War . But there is no agreement on its cause . Was it smallpox ? Scarlet fever ? Typhus ? Measles ? <P> A more exotic explanation was posed in the New England Journal of Medicine in 1985 by Dr. Alexander Langmuir , formerly chief epidemiologist at the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta . Thucydides ' description , Langmuir theorized , fit the criteria for influenza complicated by toxic shock syndrome . And although this peculiar combination of ailments had never been observed by modern physicians , Langmuir predicted that " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may reappear , " perhaps as part of some future epidemic of influenza . <P> The Delphian oracle could not have been more clairvoyant . In a recent issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association , doctors at the Minnesota Department of Health and the University of Virginia reported a total of ten cases of suspected Thucydides syndrome  --  flu complicated by TSS . Nine of the cases occurred during a major influenza outbreak in Minnesota in the winter of 1985-86 . One occurred in Roanoke , Va. , and an eleventh case , in Oregon , has since been reported to the CDC . Like the Athenian scourge , the two-part illness was lethal : six of the patients died . Langmuir says the apparent fulfillment of his prophecy had him " blown over like a feather . " <P> Though most U.S. cases of toxic shock occur in menstruating women , often in conjunction with the use of tampons , this was not true of the flu victims . Four of the eleven were males , and only two of the females were menstruating at the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tampons ) . The patients ranged in age from five to 56 , but most of the deaths were among children . Says Dr. Kristine MacDonald of the Minnesota Department of Health : " There is some suggestion that younger people are more susceptible to TSS . As people get older , more of them have antibodies to protect them . " Indeed , most adults are immune to the syndrome . <P> TSS is caused by a toxin-producing strain of the common bacterium , Staphylococcus aureus , carried benignly in the respiratory and genital tracts of perhaps one out of three people . Under certain conditions  --  a wound , some infections , the presence of a tampon or contraceptive sponge  --  the bacteria multiply . If the toxin-producing strain is present , such proliferation can lead to TSS . The symptoms are dramatic and develop quickly : high fever , a sunburn-like rash , severe vomiting and diarrhea , culminating in shock , in which blood pressure plummets and circulation deteriorates . Doctors usually try to head off this life-threatening condition by administering intravenous fluids with electrolytes , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
