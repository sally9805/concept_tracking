Can the Three Bears save the book business ? <P> <P> Book sales were up an average 14% in 1980 . So why do writers have long faces ? And why are publishers worried ? The answer can be found in the bestseller they all ignored : The Coming Currency Collapse and What to Do About It . Cheery statistics of last year can no longer hide the sober economic facts of 1982 : higher costs , escalating book prices and dwindling profits . " I have n't seen times like this before , " confesses William McCarthy , buyer for the 20-shop chain of Kroch 's &; Brentano 's bookstores in the Chicago area . " The book business is being hit by everything at once : a soft economy , cost increases and an uncertain audience . " <P> If the audience is uncertain , publishers are downright frantic . Only yesterday they could count on six-and seven-figure sales to paperback houses and thereby raise needed operating capital , fund new ventures and enrich writers ' wallets . But Fat City is rapidly becoming as legendary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Publishing Consultant Leonard Shatzkin , author of the forthcoming analysis of U.S. publishing , In Cold Type , the times get leaner by the month : 1977 paperback-reprint rights , for example , " contributed approximately 60% of total subsidiary-rights income to publishers . That went down to 37% in 1980 . I see it going down close to 0% in the next few years . " <P> What went wrong ? Inflation , principally-and poor planning for it . Printing and paper costs rose ; prices were passed on to the consumer . But in a high-volume business , where the shelf life of a book is measured in days , the average $2.25 per paperback could no longer be considered an impulse-buying item . The result : of the 900 million paperbacks shipped last year , nearly one-third were unsold . The paperback recession was echoed in the diminishing rewards to writers . Saul Bellow 's Humboldt 's Gift brought $313,000 back in 1975 , but The Dean 's December earned about two-thirds of that sum this year , even though the author had become a Nobel laureate in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1980 ) got one-third of the $1.85 million paid for his Ragtime in 1975 . Colleen McCullough 's 1977 blockbuster , The Thorn Birds , sold for $1.9 million . But An Indecent Obsession ( 1981 ) managed much less . Watergate Conspirator John Ehrlichman and bestselling Feminist Author Betty Friedan recently shared the same fate : their books were withdrawn from paperback auction because the five-figure bids were insultingly low . There was only one bidder for Gael Greene 's Doctor Love ; and although Diana Trilling 's Mrs. Harris went for $125,000 , her publisher , William Jovanovich , says , " Two years ago , it would have brought over $200,000 . " <P> The cutbacks are just beginning . Says Louis Wolfe , president of Bantam , the largest U.S. paperback house : " We 're paying more attention to what we pay up front and with good reason . We ca n't afford a lot of money for what might be a big book and then find out it is n't . We have to have a bottom-line profit , and we can no longer afford @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Shatzkin is less sanguine : " There will definitely be failures among the original trade publishers .
