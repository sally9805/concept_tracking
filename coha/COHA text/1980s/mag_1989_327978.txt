Unprecedented as they were , the talks between El Salvador 's rebels and its political parties , including the ultra-right ARENA , ended near Mexico City last week without a breakthrough . Yet in offering to lay down their arms and join " the political life of the country " in exchange for military reforms and a six-month delay in the presidential elections scheduled for March 19 , the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front ( FMLN ) clearly scored a coup . By advancing a negotiable proposal , the rebels managed to put the U.S.-backed Salvadoran government  --  and especially the army  --  on the defensive . <P> The military and ARENA have both rejected the rebel offer , effectively eliminating it as a plausible alternative . But the FMLN initiative has fueled public expectations for peace . Washington responded with reserved praise for the meeting , which ended with an agreement that the government and the insurgents should begin peace talks immediately . <P> But the FMLN has not yet traded in its guns for campaign posters . The guerrillas attacked two major military bases and knocked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the country without electricity . The message was pointed : Postpone the elections or prepare for an escalation of the war .
