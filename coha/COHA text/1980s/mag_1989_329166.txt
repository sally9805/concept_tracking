Sons of famous men often stumble when they try to follow in their father 's footsteps . That fate has befallen Frederick Wang , 38 , son of Wang Laboratories founder An Wang . The younger Wang , who took over as president of the troubled company nearly three years ago , gave up the job last week . He was apparently pushed out by his father , who retains the chairmanship and who told a reporter that he graded his son at " 75% . " A new president will be recruited from outside . <P> Frederick Wang 's departure came a week after the firm reported a $424 million loss for the fiscal year ending in June . Wang Lab 's woes stem from its failure to shift from minicomputers to industry-standard personal computers . <P> Even before last month , when the senior Wang underwent surgery for cancer of the esophagus , Wall Street suspected that the family-controlled company might be put up for sale . Now that Wang 's heir apparent has stepped aside , that prospect seems even more likely .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
