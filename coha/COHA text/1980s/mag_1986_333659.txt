There had been early warnings , a few cases reported around the country . But then 44 U.S. Navymen in Key West , Fla. , began complaining of sore throats , fever and chills . Last week , after taking throat cultures from the men , doctors confirmed the bad news : Taiwan flu has arrived and begun to take its toll . <P> Health officials have known of the new viral strain ( actually a mutation of Type A influenza strains predominant in the U.S. in the 1950s ) only since June , when the first cases were confirmed in Taiwan . Pharmaceutical companies , which had already manufactured a single-shot flu vaccine that is effective against three known and anticipated strains  --  A/Chile , A/Mississippi and B/ Ann Arbor  --  were forced to rush a separate A/Taiwan vaccine into production . Though no one knows how serious this season 's attack will be , influenza generally kills 20,000 to 40,000 Americans in a single winter , more victims than AIDS has claimed since it first appeared . <P> Despite the quick notoriety that it has gained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a close cousin of long-dormant strains , however , it poses a particular threat to people under 35 with chronic health problems ; they are not old enough to have developed a strong immunity from previous exposures . <P> Unfortunately , many of those in need of protection do not get vaccinated . Of the people who are vulnerable to complications from influenza because of other health problems , the U.S. Centers for Disease Control estimates , only one in five will actually bother to get shots . The fact that two kinds of vaccine are necessary for many people this year may be a further source of confusion about who should be inoculated . According to the CDC , the two-shot candidates include anyone under the age of 35 with chronic health problems such as diabetes , heart disease , renal disease , cancer or a suppressed immune response ; parents or siblings of children who are at risk ; anyone under age 18 who must take aspirin ( the combination of aspirin and a viral infection has been linked to a sometimes fatal brain disorder called Reye 's syndrome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all those over 65 who are otherwise healthy need take only the standard flu shot . <P> Why is it that flu marches on , while other viral scourges such as polio and measles have been largely conquered in the developed world ? The vanquished viruses , it seems , were relatively stable , seldom changing their structure . This enabled their victims , once infected , to develop permanent immunity and allowed scientists to develop vaccines that were effective year after year . The influenza virus , however , is constantly changing the configuration of its surface proteins . Because of these changes , immune-system antibodies , developed in response to either a vaccination or a previous case of flu , fail to recognize and attack the altered virus . As a result , flu  --  in ever changing forms  --  returns again and again .
