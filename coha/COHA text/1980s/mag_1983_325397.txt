The President himself led the charge . In a concentrated campaign lasting more than a month , he sought to justify his proposed increase of 10.7% in military spending for fiscal 1984 . Republicans in the Senate had agreed to delay considering the budget while he pressed his case on TV , on the road and in private . Some hoped that Reagan would carry the day by rallying voter support for the full range of military needs he endorses . Others hoped he would see the need to modify his stance . In the end he failed to do either . His public crusade backfired badly , and his unyielding position led to a stunning rebuff at the hands of his own party leaders . <P> Caught in the middle was Republican Pete Domenici , chairman of the Senate Budget Committee , who hoped to be the architect of a face-saving compromise . After House Democrats had passed a budget plan that would raise defense spending approximately 4% , the moderate New Mexico Senator believed that the White House would eventually try to reach a bipartisan accommodation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were shattered last Tuesday when G.O.P. members of the Budget Committee were summoned to the White House to hear the President 's final offer : a mere $10 billion trim in the Pentagon 's nearly $2 trillion five-year spending plan , to be accomplished by using lower figures for inflation , fuel prices and MX basing costs . <P> These were " non-options , " Domenici fumed after the session with Reagan . " There were no significant changes . It was impossible . " Said Mark Andrews of North Dakota , who had been elected in the Reagan landslide of 1980 : " These great savings turn out to be non-savings . " Andrews dismissed the lower fuel costs as " just a windfall from some sheik . " Nor did conservative Democrats give any promise of support . Complained James Exon of Nebraska : " Not a single bullet has been cut . " Members of both parties remained unconvinced that the nation could afford the buildup Reagan envisions in the face of a fiscal 1983 budget deficit that now approaches $208 billion . <P> In the meeting , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ won public backing for large defense increases with his star wars speech nearly three weeks ago outlining the Soviet menace . Dan Quayle of Indiana gaped at the President . " I found it hard to believe he was saying that , " Quayle commented later . " My state is conservative , but people do n't see the Soviet threat . They just ask , ' Why do we need these expenditures ? ' " Slade Gorton told the President that the voters in his home state of Washington wanted cuts in the defense budget . Reagan shot back : " When are we going to have enough guts to do what is right instead of what is popular ? " But even John Tower of Texas , a staunch hawk , came away insisting that the President 's military budget was doomed .
