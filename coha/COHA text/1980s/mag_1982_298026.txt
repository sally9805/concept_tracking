HENRY IV , PARTS 1 AND 2 by William Shakespeare <P> Barbican means fortification or defense . Remnants of Roman walls exist in the City of London , where the Barbican Center , a $280 million arts-cum-business complex , has been erected . Slabs and columns of pebbled concrete suggest a fortress built in modern medieval style . Splashed with bright reds and oranges on the inside to soften the austerity of the stone , the Barbican , which officially opened in March , is a labyrinth in which crowds still wander like students during freshman week , seeking the proper doors and directions . The center contains Barbican Hall , home of the London Symphony Orchestra , three cinemas , an art gallery , two restaurants and the Barbican Theater , which last week became the new London home of the Royal Shakespeare Company , replacing the venerable Aldwych Theater . With a thrust stage , and no seat farther than 65 ft. from the stage , the theater 's novelty may be that it has no aisles : playgoers enter their rows from outside the orchestra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its debut with Henry IV , Parts 1 and 2 , performed on successive evenings or , on matinee days , in a single afternoon and evening . The opening productions are stolid , earnest and distinctly uninspired . The occasion totally lacks the incandescent flow that made the company 's Nicholas Nickleby a unique theatrical experience . In tone Part 1 has a springtime mood , life blooming to be grasped ; Part 2 is autumnal , life slipping away beyond one 's grasp . <P> Henry IV , Part 1 , has one huge epicenter , that Santa Claus of roguery , Sir John Falstaff . The old knight is as nimble of wit as his belly is full of sack , a braggart , a liar , a thief , a cynic and a coward , but with all that an irresistibly endearing tub of bubbling jollity . Early on , Falstaff ( Joss Ackland ) chides the heir apparent Prince Hal ( Gerard Murphy ) , who has made the Boar 's Head Tavern his home away from the castle , for leading him into evil ways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reverse , that his scapegrace son has been corrupted by dissolute companions . He is depressed by the thought that when Hal ascends the throne , the realm will dissolve in chaos . Chaos abounds as it is . Scotland and Wales are in rebellion , and the noble families who helped Henry to overthrow Richard II are now conspiring to overthrow him . Paradoxically , the King admires one of those conspirators , Harry Percy ( Timothy Dalton ) , known as Hotspur . He so cherishes Hotspur 's valor that he wishes he had him for a son . <P> The fighting is hot , but the staging is horrific . One worries more about the actors than about friend or foe . Part of the blame rests with the set . A conundrum at best , it consists of three-tiered automatically movable towers of ill-assorted lum ber , through which the actors peek out like birds in wooden cages . During the battle scenes these towers rumble about the stage firing off errant fusillades , al most running down the soldiers as if they were pedestrians .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
