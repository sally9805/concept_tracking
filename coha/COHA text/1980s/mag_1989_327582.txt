THE JANUARY MAN <P> Directed by Pat O'Connor <P> Screenplay by John Patrick Shanley <P> There are mysteries , and then again there are mysteries . Those that involve capital crimes oblige a movie to solve the puzzle clearly , neatly and , one hopes , surprisingly before the final fade-out . There is , however , a better class of enigma that involves less deadly , even comical , forms of human behavior . And there is a better class of film that is wisely content to set forth such shadowy dilemmas and leave them unresolved , resonating in our minds . <P> The January Man is modestly , ingratiatingly , a movie of the latter sort . To be sure , it begins with a serial killer claiming a victim , and it ends with the guilty party being taken into custody . But the deductive process that normally leads to this conventionally ordained conclusion is perfunctory and even somewhat implausible . What interests writer John Patrick Shanley , who won an Academy Award last year for Moonstruck , is the infinite and usually inexplicable capacity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of expression . The prime example here is Nick Starkey ( Kevin Kline ) , a former New York City cop and now a fireman . As Starkey , Kline has the best entrance in recent movie memory : bursting spectacularly out of a burning building , cradling the child he has rescued in his arms , he collapses to the sidewalk and calls for a cup of coffee , " preferably espresso . " <P> Besides being brave , Nick is something of an ironist . This quality , if nothing else , is a sign of intelligence . Before taking up fire fighting , Nick was a cop falsely tainted by corruption . Now the very people who secretly profited by victimizing him  --  the crooked , volcanic mayor ( Rod Steiger ) and the bland , bureaucratic police commissioner ( Harvey Keitel )  --  need him to lead the hunt for a maniacal killer . <P> It is an offer the ironist can not refuse . Not only is the commissioner his long-loathed brother , he is also the man who married Christine ( Susan Sarandon ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ price for cooperation ? One tete-a-tete with that ambiguous lady . In Shanley 's world , it is inevitable that this does not go awfully well . Nick asks her to listen to the wine breathe , serves octopus for the main course and generally comes on too strong . It is also inevitable that a perfect substitute for Christine will soon turn up . And it does , in the form of the mayor 's daughter ( Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio ) . This is not love as usual ; this is the need for sexual revenge . <P> What prevents The January Man from turning into a downscale Dangerous Liaisons is the movie 's refusal to let the characters acknowledge this edgy subtext . Shanley instead provides a funny , melodramatic hubbub to distract our attention . His busy plotting may require a suspension of incredulity , but he is well served by good actors ; by a director , Pat O'Connor , with a taste for the acrid flavors of big-city life ; and by his own delight in human eccentricity .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
