Supported by Moscow , Syria backs away from its promise to leave Lebanon <P> " No war is possible without Egypt , and no peace is possible without Syria . " - Henry Kissinger <P> Sure enough , it was Syria 's turn , backed by the Soviet Union , to block the withdrawal of foreign forces from Lebanon . After five months of negotiations , the U.S. had finally extracted an agreement from Israel and Lebanon for a removal of Israel 's 30,000 troops in Lebanon . But the deal was based on a simultaneous withdrawal of Syrian and Palestine Liberation Organization forces . When U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz flew to the Syrian capital of Damascus , capping two weeks of shuttle diplomacy that had brought about the Israeli-Lebanese accord , he learned that Syrian President Hafez Assad had a long list of objections . <P> Lebanese Foreign Minister Elie Salem heard about those objections firsthand when he flew to Damascus late last week , hoping at the very least to talk the Syrians into holding discussions on the subject . He got nowhere . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We know that President Assad will not accept the agreement . " Undeterred , the Lebanese government unanimously approved the accord with Israel the next day . <P> The Syrians appeared to have embarked on a dangerous game . In the past two months , they have sent an additional 10,000 troops into the Bekaa Valley of eastern Lebanon , increasing their strength to nearly 50,000 . At the same time , P.L.O . commandos have slipped back into northern Lebanon , swelling their ranks from 8,000 to at least 10,000 . Among them : P.L.O . Chairman Yasser Arafat , who in his first trip back to Lebanon since his forced departure from Beirut last summer reportedly spent a day visiting guerrilla units in the Bekaa Valley . The Syrian war machine , shattered by Israel during last year 's righting in Lebanon , has been restocked with bigger and better equipment that requires the presence of 4,800 to 6,000 Soviet military advisers and technicians . In what many diplomats saw as a blatant attempt to heighten tension in the area , the Soviets ostentatiously removed 110 diplomatic dependents from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impending conflict . <P> The U.S. acknowledged the increase in Syrian and P.L.O . troop strength in Lebanon . Said Shultz after his return to Washington : " First of all , it is a violation of the agreement under which the P.L.O . evacuated Beirut . Second , it is an unwelcome development . We want them to be moving out , not in . " In the meantime , the State Department issued a list of statements in which Syria had promised to get out of Lebanon as soon as the Israelis did . On Feb. 14 , for example , Syrian Foreign Minister Abdel Halim Khaddam told his French counterpart , Claude Cheysson , that " Syria would withdraw its forces from Lebanon if the Israelis withdrew their troops . " U.S. diplomats note that Syrian officials have repeatedly said the same thing to them in private .
