To Republican Congressman Robert Walker , the $88 billion highway bill is filled with " page after page of pork-barrel projects . " But to drivers stuck on Boston 's " distressway , " inching along Illinois 121 toward Peoria , or stewing in traffic in hundreds of other communities , funds for new roads , bridges and tunnels can not come soon enough . Some of the most urgent  --  and the most questionable : <P> Los Angeles : Metro Rail . Planned as the area 's first rapid-transit system since the " red car " rail network was scrapped in the 1960s , the 20-mile , $4.5 billion subway is nonetheless considered extravagant . Construction began last fall on the first , 4.4-mile downtown segment , which will cost $1.25 billion , with $870 million coming from Washington . Opponents favor less costly projects , like surface railroads along existing freeways . One critical slogan : " Stop the Subway and Save Mass Transit . " The highway bill gives L.A. another , more widely praised plum : 27 smaller projects , valued at $74 million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Angeles-Long Beach . <P> Phoenix : Papago Freeway . Just 26 blocks of roadway downtown is needed to complete the 2,484-mile Interstate 10 from Jacksonville , Fla. , to Los Angeles . Price : $182 million . Federal share in the bill : $28 million . <P> Dallas : North Central Expressway . This aging artery to the northern suburbs of Richardson and Plano has been overloaded for years . Eight miles of road will double in width to eight lanes ; the frightfully short merge lanes will be lengthened . Price : $109 million . Federal share : $40 million . <P> Minnesota : Bloomington Project . A $47 million replacement of a bridge over the Minnesota River will link the area south of the river with the Minneapolis suburb of Bloomington . The present structure , a temporary span with a six-year anticipated life , was put up in 1978 . It has been underwater three times after storms . Highway-bill contribution : $16 million . <P> Illinois : Lincoln-Morton Link . Already under construction , the 31-mile highway will connect Interstates 74 and 55 , cutting 40 miles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by House Minority Leader Robert Michel , who represents the area , the stretch would provide an alternative to Route 121 , two lanes of inadequate winding blacktop on which highballing truckers terrify motorists . Total price tag : $135 million , of which the highway bill provides $17 million . <P> Pennsylvania : Altoona to Tyrone . State Road 220 is congested and heavily traveled . A twelve-mile stretch will be widened from two to four lanes , ultimately linking economically depressed Altoona to I-80 and New York City . Price : $90 million . Federal share : $45 million . <P> Boston : Central Artery/Harbor Tunnel . The I-93 north-south expressway and the two tunnels that connect downtown to Logan International Airport are congested eight hours a day . Massive infusions of money into the mass-transit system , boat shuttles and airport helicopter services have failed to reduce traffic . Solution : widen and lower to ground level the now elevated distressway and build a third harbor tunnel . Price : $3.1 billion . Federal share : $2.5 billion .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
