It began with the launching of 3,000 balloons and ended with the bursting of thousands more , but in between , the Baltimore Orioles and their fans scared the daylights out of the Milwaukee Brewers . This was only natural , because the Orioles and Halloween share the same colors . And this year they nearly shared the same month . // It came down to the last game of the regular season , Jim Palmer versus Don Sutton , for the American League East title , Earl Weaver 's grand finale as Oriole manager and thousands of people screaming , " Sweep ! Sweep ! " while some even waved brooms . It was , in fact , only the second time in baseball history that the two teams tied for first place had met in the last regularly scheduled game of the season . The Yankees beat the Red Sox on the other occasion in 1949 . This time it was the Brewers , who came alive after three moribund losses and won 10-2. // " Yesterday , I felt like my chest was wide open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ homer in the ninth put the finishing touch on Sunday 's victory . " And I felt like they were ready to pluck out my heart . But now I see our guys crying with joy . " // The Brewers had to stare down the Orioles , the Baltimore fans and , in a sense , themselves to win their first title . In the opening three games of last weekend 's series , Baltimore had outscored the Brewers 26-7 , while the crowds drove them crazy . But on Sunday , Milwaukee displayed the power and the glory it had shown all season . It was too bad for Weaver , but the Brewers were just too good . // Irony fans had a good time with the thought of Palmer pitching Weaver 's last regular-season game  --  he had long ago announced his retirement  --  with a championship on the line . As if that were n't enough , here was Sutton doing exactly what the Brewers expected of him when they picked up his $750,000 a year contract from the Astros on August 30. // But the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drifted lazily into the rightfield seats in the first inning , and his second homer of the game and 29th of the season gave the Brewers a 3-0 lead in the third . Yount pulled within one hit of beating out Kansas City 's Willie Wilson for the batting title when he tripled in the eighth . But in the ninth , the league 's most valuable player was hit by a pitch and ended the season with a .3307 average . Wilson finished at .3316. // Palmer was gone by the sixth  --  pulled from a game for the last time by his old nemesis-manager  --  but Sutton hung on for eight gutty innings . Backed by a superb defense , most notably Leftfielder Ben Oglivie 's sliding two-on , two-out eighth-inning catch of Joe Nolan 's shot into the corner with the score 5-2 , Sutton survived three jams , an accusation that he was scuffing the ball and a bad cold . " I had a sore throat , " he said , " so I took penicillin to get rid of the cold , cortisone to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cortisone ... pitching made better through chemistry . " // The game was never really out of the Orioles ' reach until the ninth , when Milwaukee exploded for five runs . But even in the bottom of the final inning , Baltimore fans exhorted the O 's until Gary Roenicke flied out to Oglivie to end the game . Then , while the Brewers cavorted and six police horses pranced , the crowd called a tearful Weaver out for one last ovation : " W-E-A-V-E-R ! " // The Brewers arrived in Baltimore needing to win only one game of the four . Their magic number to tie had been just one since Wednesday , Sept. 29 , when the Orioles lost 3-2 to the Tigers in Detroit while Milwaukee beat the Red Sox 6-3 in Boston on Ned Yost 's three-run , first-of-the-year homer in the ninth . The Brewers presumptuously congratulated each other after that one . The next night , Baltimore defeated Detroit 6-5 as Milwaukee fell 9-4 to Boston . Three games up with four to play , the Brewers took their nine cases of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ balloons , half of them red , white and blue and half of them orange , black and white , at the start of Friday 's doubleheader . The Brewers took a 1-0 lead when Leftfielder John Lowenstein misplayed Charlie Moore 's fly ball , but the Orioles came back with three runs in the second on three singles , a walk off Milwaukee ace Pete Vuckovich and a bad throw by Second Baseman Jim Gantner . Baltimore never trailed after that , even though Dennis Martinez gave up back-to-back homers to Simmons and Oglivie in the sixth . The final : Orioles 8 , Brewers 3 . Wild Bill Hagy , the legendary cabbie who 'd been sighted in Memorial Stadium only half a dozen times this season , led one of his famous spelling bees in the bottom of the seventh . // By the time the nightcap started , the moon was full and 51,883 fans , the second-largest regular-season Memorial Stadium crowd in history , had arrived . This game belonged to Oriole rookies . Storm Davis , all of 20 , pitched a six-hitter , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 22 , homered as Baltimore won 7-1 . Ripken 's dinger in the seventh gave him 28 homers and 93 RBIs for the year , both team rookie records . // The Brewers ' pitching staff was beleaguered . Manager Harvey Kuenn had to leave Mike Caldwell in to absorb a seven-run pounding because his bullpen was tired from having to fill Rollie Fingers ' jar of mustache wax . Fingers , who had been the Milwaukee pen until he went out with a sore arm on Sept. 2 , could n't throw 20 warmups without hurting . // But of more immediate concern to Milwaukee was , of all things , hitting . Gorman Thomas , 39 homers and 112 RBIs , was in a slump and was an oh-for in the twin bill . A man from Wisconsin called the press box to have somebody tell Thomas to move closer to the plate . // After the game , General Manager Harry Dalton gave the Brewers a short speech . " I just told them they were an excellent ball club , that they had nothing to be ashamed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dalton . " I decided to do it in the ninth inning as I was waiting in the clubhouse . It was n't a great speech . I was n't exactly William Jennings Bryan . " // The Orioles were clearly enjoying themselves . " We came in here , really , with nothing to lose and everything to gain , " said Jim Dwyer . Three years ago , Baltimore was in the reverse position : The O 's led Pittsburgh 3-1 in the World Series , needing to win only one of the last three games . They didn't. // Before Saturday 's game , the Orioles engaged in their usual high jinks . Rich Dauer kidded Palmer about his shampoo commercial . Mike Flanagan kidded Rick Dempsey about Dempsey 's cutting himself shaving and asking Trainer Ralph Salvon for a " skeptic pencil . " Everybody ganged up on Dempsey for running down the leftfield line after a foul ball Friday night and colliding with Dauer . Flanagan received compliments on the excellent job he 'd done superimposing Davis ' face on one of Palmer 's underwear posters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ separate the large and small lima beans . Although the players were supposed to be in uniform by 11:55 , the unis did n't arrive from the laundry until noon . Flanagan threatened to shag flies in his underwear . " That would be great , " said Pitching Coach Ray Miller . " The Brewers would see that and say , ' Boy , are they loose . ' " // The Brewers were n't . Before games they usually hold baseball 's most boisterous game of flip , which is sort of Hot Potato with violence . In Boston , they had as many as 21 players involved . But Saturday the turnout was sparse , and the game lacked its usual gaiety . The only Brewer who looked ready was Oglivie  --  at 1 p.m. he was sleeping on the clubhouse couch , hat over his eyes , crossword puzzle stuffed inside his shirt . // It was a nice day for a game . The sky was blue , the temperature in the 70s . The Orioles scored three runs off Doc Medich right away . Eddie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Singleton and Medich balked home Murray . But the Brewers came back with two in the second off Scott McGregor , the runs scoring on Gantner 's blooped single . The crowd , which had been exuberant at the start , became hushed . " I heard them go quiet , " said Reliever Sammy Stewart , " so I started waving a towel around in the bullpen to get them to cheer . " That 's not all Stewart did . He relieved McGregor soon after Oglivie tied the game 3-3 in the fourth with a homer and pitched the rest of the way , allowing no runs and two hits . " He was up and throwing eight times yesterday , " Weaver said later . " He 's worth his weight in gold . " Stewart weighs 208 pounds , so make that $1,467,823 at the going rate of $402 a Troy ounce . // The Orioles broke free with four runs in the fourth on four singles and a throwing error by Third Baseman Paul Molitor . Weaver had Baltimore stealing and playing hit-and-run , which are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Jim Dwyer got on base all four times he was up , giving him 13 straight , three short of Ted Williams ' record , set in 1957 . " If I was Ted , I would n't worry , " Dwyer said later . True enough . The streak ended in his first at bat on Sunday , when he bounced to the pitcher . On Saturday , Milwaukee owner Bud Selig paced the press box and muttered , " If I see another blooper , I 'm going to be sick . " Indeed the Orioles were getting a lot of cheap hits . " It 's a game of inches , " Kuenn said later , " and let 's face it , they 've had more inches . " // Hagy led three O-R-I-O-L-E-S cheers in the eighth , and Baltimore responded with four more runs , all on singles off Dwight Bernard . The final score was 11-3 , and the sounds of " Sweep ! Sweep ! " shook the neighborhood . // " I think the whole thing is a dream , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes to a tie with Palmer and Sutton going . You could n't ask for more than that . " " I 've pitched bigger ones before , " said Sutton , " and I hope I 'll pitch bigger ones down the road . Tomorrow 's one of the situations you work for in life . That does n't mean I 'll do well  --  it just means I 'll enjoy it . " // " I 'd enjoy it more if I felt better , " said Palmer in his nearly deserted clubhouse . " My arm does n't feel very well , and the team does n't score behind me . I 've never really won a big game before . " When Weaver heard Palmer complaining , he yelled , " That makes two of us . We 'll get by on guts alone tomorrow . All I want out of you is eight and two-thirds of good baseball , and I 'll do the rest . " // But Palmer could n't go deeper than two batters into the sixth , when he left with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pull . In his swan song , he sent six pinch hitters up in the eighth and ninth . In his office afterward Weaver said , " I do n't want anybody feeling sorry for me . God 's been too good to me , Baltimore 's been too good to me , my players have been too good to me. " // The Brewers went about their bedlam quietly . Former player Sal Bando , Milwaukee 's special assistant to the general manager who was put in uniform this week by Dalton to be a cheerleader , sat by himself , smiling and sipping champagne . " The only thing that was going to make us feel better was if something good happened in a game , " he said , " and fortunately , we got that right away today . " // " We approached this Series trying to win just one of four , " said Thomas . " That hurt us in the first game , and by the time we got around to rethinking it in the second game , we were way south . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game nobody was playing cards or doing crosswords . But I came in today and we were playing cards , and somebody was cutting up somebody 's pants . I knew we 'd be all right . "
