With a haircut , a couple of breath mints , and wearing its job-hunting clothes , this bluesy ramble about being down but not quite out in Texas might pass as the loosest-jointed novel in years . As things are , call it a collection of related stories , some short , some tall , and some too lackadaisical to stand up and be measured . Good stuff , anyway , whose major virtue is that it is extraordinarily lifelike . Which is to say , messy , disorganized , contrary , repetitious , tacky , funny , if you are in the mood for that sort of thing  --  and in need of laundering . <P> The narrator and central figure , who has the same name as the author , is weak on men and money , strong on children and survival . She is 40 or so and a fierce lover of her layabout poet Leo , a cashiered college professor . She wants to write and also likes to smoke a little dope . In the meantime , she keeps the necessary $50 ahead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room roach farm she shares with Leo and her grown son Morgani ) by soldiering for an office-temporaries outfit . <P> She is a curious watcher of her own slightly out-of-focus life , preserved from the swamps of resentment and depression by mild fatalism and the occasional joint . Episodes are sifted and examined , but not retailed as anecdotes . Some really are conventional stories , or nearly so , with shape and some sort of resolution . Two or three are wholly shapeless , like twelve months out of twelve in the real world . The narrator meets a renowned Indian healer named Rolling Thunder , and nothing happens ; then a crazed and menacing religious cultist , and nothing happens again . Even when the narrator 's brain- dazed brother , an outlaw biker , kills a man in a brawl  --  something happens here , certainly  --  the fact comes out only as an aside , as part of a moody , troubling description of his skirmish with a bored psychiatrist at a VA hospital . The author 's sound instinct is to play against the dramatic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You are missing the point if you try to watch one chunk of carrot in the roil of this Sleazy Street stew ( the phrase is from a country-funk song lyric in praise of downward mobility : " It 's coffee in the pot and a dirty sugar spoon/ it 's towels on the floor of a dirty bathroom/ and a smell like me and a smell like you/ all mixed together in a Sleazy Street stew . " <P> Leo the poet gets disgusted and leaves , comes back , then leaves again . You ca n't blame him . Pat , as she admits , is overplaying her role of Mother Courage as Kelly Girl . Not only does she now have her own three children living with her , she has also taken in Pauline , who has five kids and a pregnant German shepherd . Chaos , at least . And lurking about Pauline are a violent estranged husband and a homicidal ex-husband .

Will Leo resurface , maybe to have another birthday party with Pat and Morgani , all bivouacking in their tiny van parked at a curb in Austin , living happily ever after or until arrested for loitering , whichever comes first ? Hope so .
