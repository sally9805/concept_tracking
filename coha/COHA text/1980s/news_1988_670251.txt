ZURICH  --  If , as the saying goes , No. 2 tries harder , then Credit Suisse syndicate managers are working overtime . For the past two years , Switzerland ' s third largest bank has been attempting to surpass Union Bank of Switzerland as the lead underwriter of Swiss franc foreign bonds , only to see UBS move ahead by year end . Last year , for instance , most bankers say , a last-minute 400 million franc ( $606. 6 million ) deal for the Canadian province of Alberta gave UBS the edge over Credit Suisse , after Credit Suisse narrowly led the league tables for the first three quarters . It ' s hardly surprising then that in the middle of this year , Credit Suisse once again leads the league tables for Swiss bonds . But UBS officials take the half-year totals in stride . " For us , the crucial figures are at year end , and we are good sprinters , " says Reto Diezi , a vice president at UBS . According to Credit Suisse figures , it has launched 44 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 5. 29 billion francs . UBS , on the other hand , has launched 38 deals totaling 4. 65 billion francs . Swiss Bank Corp. has launched 40 issues totaling 4. 49 billion francs . Together , the fixed underwriting consortium led by the five largest Swiss banks launched a total of 15. 471 billion francs , for 70. 4% of the market . The 634 million franc difference between the first two spots is roughly the equivalent of three typical bond issues , meaning that the quest for No. 1 is far from decided . But it does show that Credit Suisse ' s push for a larger share of the Swiss bond market continues . Credit Suisse overtook SBC for the No. 2 spot in 1984 , but it wasn ' t until recently that it has attempted to drive UBS from its throne . Hans Rudolf Zehnder , who has headed Credit Suisse ' s syndication department since 1986 , credits his bank ' s success this year to hustling for new clients and a push to improve the number of equity-linked deals it launches . Credit Suisse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lucrative Japanese convertible note sector in Switzerland , but also to successfully launch equity-linked deals for European borrowers in a year when stocks are a touchy subject . Mr. Zehnder points to deals such as the one brought in early February for New Corp. and a public deal for Wolters Kluwer NV . He also rattles off the names of new clients that Credit Suisse has worked with this year  --  European names like Mo Och Domsjo and Oppland Energiverk , as well as Asian borrowers like Malaysia and Thailand . Mr. Zehnder ' s competitors contend that Credit Suisse has reached the No. 1 spot because the bank has simply launched more tightly priced bonds . Competitors point to the second of two deals launched for Oppland Energiverk by Credit Suisse , in which all but three banks in the fixed underwriting syndicate declined to participate because of aggressive pricing . " You can ' t quantify it . You can ' t say that one bank has launched ' x ' number of tight deals . It ' s just a feeling , and the feeling is that Credit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said a Zurich syndicate manager . Mr. Zehnder plays down this criticism . He points to the fact that Credit Suisse leads in the number of publicly listed bonds launched but lags in the number of unlisted notes it issued . This is significant , he says , because bond issues pay higher commissions than unlisted notes . Credit : Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal
