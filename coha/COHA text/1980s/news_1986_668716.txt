Cook County Circuit Judge Reginald Holzer was a man whose finances were " a junkyard " and who was perched on the edge of bankruptcy , but he was not a corrupt jurist who committed a federal crime , his lawyer declared Friday . Invoking the Declaration of Independence in an emotional , fist-pounding argument , Edward L. Foote , implored the jury hearing Holzer ' s corruption trial to acquit his client . Foote leveled a scathing attack on the government for having granted immunity from prosecution to more than a dozen witnesses who testified that they arranged for loans to Holzer . But the government produced no testimony that there was a relationship between the financial benefits and any advantages the witnesses received , he said . " How can this case be established beyond a reasonable doubt when the immunized witnesses deny the crime ? " Foote said . Holzer , Foote said , " is about the only one I ever heard of who had a 13- year corruption plan that ends up in bankruptcy . " Holzer did not know of the intent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Foote said . " You ' ve got to have more than speculation . There isn ' t an ounce of evidence of what was in my client ' s head , " he said . " Each of these cases were necessary , and the fees were not excessive , " Foote said . " Ladies and gentlemen , where is the federal crime ? " Foote reminded the jury of a defendant ' s " inalienable right " to be found guilty " beyond a reasonable doubt . . . . Please do not compromise my client ' s life . My client ' s life is in your hands . It is a thread you can hold onto . " Holzer , 58 , is on trial on charges of racketeering , mail fraud and extortion . He is accused of using his position to obtain $200 , 000 in loans from lawyers and court receivers who appeared before him between 1974 and 1984 . Most of the loans have not been repaid . Foote addressed the jury as the trial , now in its sixth week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was to instruct the jury later Friday . And its members were to begin deliberations and work over the weekend , if necessary . Foote also criticized the government for introducing evidence of the earnings and spending habits of Holzer ' s wife , Estelle , who testified on behalf of her husband . " Are we going to judge my client ' s criminal conduct by the amount of money she spent at a certain store ? " Foote said . " That the money should have been spent on the judge ' s ridiculous debts ? " Foote added , " Was it done to make you angry ? Will you punish my client ? Does it add a scintilla to the junkyard of finances of Reggie Holzer and his mental state ? " Holzer ' s daughter , Bambi , sat next to her sister , Audrey , and their mother in the front row of the packed courtroom and began to weep silently as Foote recounted how Estelle left a job as a substitute teacher in 1968 for an insurance career that now generates more than $100 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' t think you should judge my client ' s behavior by the success or failure of his wife , " Foote said.
