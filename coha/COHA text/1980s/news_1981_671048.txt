In the current high tide of Reagan conservativism , that prediction haunts Democratic Party leaders as the 1982 elections approach . And it goads Mr. Hart , Mr. McGovern ' s former campaign manager who is now a Senator from Colorado , to focus his energies on a pragmatic pruning of Democratic liberalism and a restless search for new ideas to rejuvenate his party. // Fellow Democrats , knowing he appears in behalf of other Democratic candidates and speaks on revision of the military , energy independence or economic revitalization , suspect that Senator Hart is angling for a spot on the Democratic Presidential ticket in 1984 or in 1988 . Against the Reagan-Republican landslide of 1980 , he proved to be the lone survivor among besieged Western Democratic Senators. // But Mr. Hart denies his eye is on 1984 . " I ' m not running , " he insists . " I don ' t have a political action committee or any organization . I don ' t have a political staff . I ' m not raising money or doing polling . I ' m @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ focusing on this effort to redefine the party . " <> <> The Source of Leadership // " What you ' re really talking about is leadership , " he goes on , " and in the 1980 ' s , I think this will come more from a person ' s mind than from traditional organization. " // Still , Charles T. Manatt , the Democratic national chairman , quickly includes the 43-year-old Senator on his list of potential contenders along with former Vice President Walter F. Mondale , Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts , Senator John Glenn of Ohio and Gov . John D. Rockefeller 4th of West Virginia. // " I pick up a sense of party people wanting to get to know Gary Hart better , a feeling that he ' s quite modern , not particularly an ideologue but someone with a third viewpoint between liberals and conservatives , " Mr. Mannatt said . " He ' s got a potential political base in the West and a personal network from the old McGovern crowd. " // Despite his experience in the McGovern campaign , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Democratic Senators praise his intellect and his efforts at innovation , but do not cite him as an outstanding legislative tactician . <> <> Does Well on Television // Handsome , stylishly conservative in dress , serious and forcefully articulate , Mr. Hart comes across best on television . Sometimes he acts shy about traditional handshake politics among crowds. // Quite naturally for a former Yale divinity and law student and a would-be philosophy teacher , his forte is " mixing it up intellectually " whether with Republican corporate executives , Democratic Party activists , or League of Women Voters audiences . On Nov. 11 , he spoke at Cornell University ' s convocation against nuclear war , getting added satisfaction from kicking around ideas at a small campus lunch with some young economists. // Although Senator Hart resists political labels , others call him a neo-liberal who opposes wasteful bureaucracy , overregulation and the ineffectiveness of some Great Society programs and seeks more workable approaches , but who rejects the " social inequities " of the Reagan program and elimination of programs like job training. // " Our challenge now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reagan would have us do , but to seek economic alternatives that will give us both economic growth and social equity , " Senator Hart says , his lanky , agile figure stretched back across an armchair , arms clasped behind his head . <> <> Seeking a New Route // Like many Democrats adjusting to the new political climate , he seeks a third avenue between more doctrinaire New Deal liberals like House Speaker Thomas P. O ' Neill Jr. and the conservative Boll Weevil Democrats who repeatedly joined forces with President Reagan last year. // Characteristic of the Hart approach is the movement to change the military , which involves a Congressional group that has tried to break out of the customary debate over how much to spend on the military to seek new , more cost-efficient approaches. // For example , he favors different tactics for ground forces in Europe to overcome Soviet firepower advantages ; less complex weapons systems to reduce mechanical failures ; smaller , cheaper aircraft carriers ; and ships that would prolong the life of old hulls by replacing outdated superstructures with modern modules. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 20 here " rethinking " three areas - the military , energy and the economy . In energy , his goal is independence from Persian Gulf oil by 1990 through conservation , new energy sources and an import fee of $10 a barrel . Unsuccessfully , he fought for a ban on imports of Libyan oil this year . <> <> His Views on the Economy // On the economy , he emphasizes tax incentives to hold down wage and price increases and to boost small , high-risk , high-technology businesses which promise good productivity and international competitiveness. // His political evolution mirrors a broader shift among Democrats in Congress , who are now less idealistic and more hard-headed toward generous-minded , expensive programs but who are still dedicated to protecting individual liberties and the little people in America and still averse to big business and now big government. // But how would the liberal Gary Hart of 1972 get along with the new Gary Hart ? " Of course , I ' ve changed , " the Senator concedes . " I ' d be disappointed if I hadn ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a nation in transition . My political roots are in the John Kennedy wing of the Democratic Party - pragmatic liberalism as opposed to the ideological liberalism of Eleanor Roosevelt and Adlai Stevenson . I worked for McGovern in ' 72 because I was opposed to our intervention in Vietnam and he stood in for the Kennedy wing of the party . Gene McCarthy was the representative of the Roosevelt-Stevenson wing. " //
