Among the electorate as a whole , the survey showed that on the foreign policy issues Mr. Mondale pressed in the debate last Sunday , more people side with him than with Mr. Reagan. // But Mr. Reagan ' s overwhelming strength on the economy and doubts about Mr. Mondale ' s leadership that have increased over the past 10 days have had a more powerful effect with most voters and have stalled Mr. Mondale ' s challenge at this stage , the poll indicated. // <> <> Uneasiness With Mondale // In the survey , taken by telephone Oct. 23-25 among 1 , 068 registered voters , roughly half the probable voters said they were uneasy about the way Mr. Mondale would handle a foreign crisis or manage the economy , while solid majorities expressed confidence in Mr. Reagan in both areas. // Aside from the expected opposition among Republicans , the survey showed the Democratic nominee running into particularly strong resistance among people identifying themselves as independents , among men and among the large block of voters in the 30-to-44-year-old bracket , many of whom were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ While heavy television advertising efforts and intense campaigning in the final week may lead voters to change their minds , The Times/CBS News Poll indicated that the margin between Mr. Reagan and Mr. Mondale had widened since mid-October. // The poll found that among probable voters 53 percent favored Mr. Reagan and 35 percent favored Mr. Mondale , as against 50 percent for Mr. Reagan and 37 percent for Mr. Mondale in a Times/CBS News poll taken Oct. 14-17 . In both polls the overall percentages were subject to sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points. // In the current survey , 12 percent of the registered voters said they were still undecided . When the undecided were asked their leaning , slightly more went to Mr. Reagan . Including them , he led by 56 to 37 percent. // Many Women Are UndecidedMore than two-thirds of those still undecided are over 45 years old , identify themselves either as Democrats or independents , and as ideologically moderate or conservative . Slightly more than half are women . On the pivotal questions of leadership , their views are closer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difference between men and women in voter preference , what politicians call the gender gap , was larger than ever in the current survey . Mr. Reagan did much better among men than Mr. Mondale while his margin among women was modest . The survey found Mr. Reagan was preferred among men by 59 to 29 percent and among women by just 47 to 41 percent. // Roughly one-third of the probable voters told The Times/CBS News Poll that they worried that Mr. Reagan was too old to be an effective President for the next four years , and among that group Mr. Mondale had more than a 5-to-1 margin . But among those who were not troubled by the 73-year-old President ' s age , Mr. Reagan is a 5-to-2 favorite. // There were several foreign policy issues on which more voters supported Mr. Mondale ' s position than Mr. Reagan ' s. // Among these were his assertions that the Federal Government should do more to achieve nuclear arms control , his warning that a space-based antimissile system will accelerate the arms race , his opposition to aid for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charges that Mr. Reagan is at least somewhat to blame for the fatal bombings of three American installations in Lebanon. // Over all , the poll found that among the one voter in five who is more swayed by military and foreign policy issues than the economy , Mr. Mondale runs narrowly behind Mr. Reagan. // But the poll found that the economy was by far the most powerful issue driving the election , with 55 percent of the electorate saying it was more important than anything else , and it works very strongly for Mr. Reagan. // Moreover , according to the survey , Mr. Mondale has lost ground in the past 10 days on what many political strategists consider the two most critical personal indicators : the public ' s perceptions of a candidate ' s leadership and its general reaction to a candidate . Loss of Confidence // After the first Presidential debate in Louisville , Ky. , on Oct. 7 , a modest plurality rated Mr. Mondale a strong leader . But now , after the second debate in Kansas City , Mo. , that plurality turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 45 percent saying he was not . By contrast , 70 percent say Mr. Reagan is a strong leader , a level he has maintained all fall. // With just nine days of campaigning left , the poll indicated that Mr. Mondale faced formidable obstacles in his efforts to jar Mr. Reagan ' s support . It found that more than 90 percent of the voters on either side said their minds were made up and that 56 percent of the Reagan supporters were enthusiastic about their choice , as against 36 percent of Mr. Mondale ' s supporters. // The poll underscored , however , that it is in the battle for the political center , often the key to American elections , that Mr. Mondale has encountered his most striking difficulties . A comparison with 1976 , when Jimmy Carter narrowly defeated President Ford , underscores his problems. // In 1976 , Mr. Carter beat Mr. Ford among self-described Democrats by 77 percent to 22 percent and lost Republicans by 9 percent to 90 percent , according to a CBS News Poll of voters on Election Day . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mr. Mondale led Mr. Reagan among Democrats by a margin of 69 percent to 22 percent and trailed among Republicans by 5 percent to 88 percent . The Independent Vote // Crucial to Mr. Carter ' s victory was his relatively strong showing among independents , whom he lost by only 43 percent to 54 percent . By contrast , among this large swing group , comprising roughly a third of the probable electorate this year , Mr. Mondale is far behind , 16 percent to 66 percent , with 16 percent undecided. // As a strongly traditional Democrat , Mr. Mondale has had troubles with independents all year , both in the primaries and in the general election campaign . According to The Times/ CBS News Poll , his difficulties lie less with his positions on the issues than with his generally low personal popularity among independents and their perception of him as a relatively weak leader , especially in comparison with Mr. Reagan. // In specific areas of leadership , independents are considerably more uneasy about Mr. Mondale ' s ability to handle a foreign crisis than is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other voters that the economy will get worse if he is elected. // On some issues like Central America and Lebanon , independents tend to side more with Mr. Mondale than Mr. Reagan . But on the overall impact of the Reagan foreign policy and especially on the central issue of whether Reagan policies toward the Soviet Union have made the country more secure , the independents give the President more credit for success than does the electorate at large. // In terms of age groups , Republican strategists have been trumpeting Mr. Reagan ' s appeal among voters under 30 . But the latest Times/CBS News Poll showed that while Mr. Mondale still lags among that group , it is no longer his worst segment. // According to the survey , Mr. Reagan is now scoring best with voters from the ages of 30 to 44 , most of whom were born in the post-World War II baby boom and came of age in the Vietnam War era . They make up roughly 30 percent of the electorate. // Like independents , a group they somewhat overlap , the Vietnam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leader . But what most powerfully motivates their Presidential choice is the economy , the survey showed . Two-thirds of this group cited the economy as more important than any other issue , and those who did went nearly 7-to-1 for Mr. Reagan. // The latest poll shows that the other half of the Democratic ticket , Geraldine A. Ferraro , has also suffered a decline in general popularity over the past 10 days , since her debate with Vice President Bush . Mrs. Ferraro ' s rating has generally not moved in tandem with Mr. Mondale ' s in previous polls , and the latest poll gave no reason for the shift. // The latest survey showed that on balance women had a favorable impression of Mrs. Ferraro and men an unfavorable impression , leaving her with a narrowly positive rating over all . Her best region was the West ; her worst , the South . College graduates liked her , on balance , but those with less education were negative . Independents , like Republicans , were against her , and Democrats were for her. // //  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
