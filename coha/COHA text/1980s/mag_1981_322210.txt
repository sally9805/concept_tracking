Sandinistas jail businessmen <P> After the Sandinista regime took power in Nicaragua 27 months ago , two symbols showed that pluralism and democracy could somehow coexist with a leftist revolution . One was the fiercely independent newspaper La Prensa , which has become an increasingly vocal critic of the nine-man Sandinista directorate . The other was the Superior Council of Private Enterprise , known by its Spanish acronym COSEP , a politically powerful association representing the country 's embattled private business sector . Earlier this month the Sandinista government threatened to close down La Prensa . Last week the Sandinistas moved against COSEP . After publicly accusing the government of egregious economic mismanagement and " an undeniable Marxist-Leninist line , " four leaders of COSEP were summarily arrested and jailed by Sandinista security forces . So were 22 members of the Communist Party for criticizing government economic policy .

They had also advocated a mixed economy of socialism and free enterprise to rebuild Nicaragua 's war-torn economy . But from the beginning , according to a Sandinista document , the government had planned to give the capitalists free rein only until it was able to take over the economy . COSEP members saw their control whittled away by nationalizations of banks , some industry and agricultural holdings . The economy became dependent upon an estimated $450 million in foreign aid and loans , $60 million of it from the U.S. last year . <P> Last November , Jorge Salazar , a respected business leader , was gunned down by government security forces for allegedly supplying arms to counterrevolutionaries . Salazar 's death united COSEP against the Sandinistas . Last February COSEP 's Dreyfus criticized the Sandinistas for allowing manufacturing to drop 35% below government projections . Said he : " All this is the consequence of financial indiscipline in a government which is in the process of reconstructing the country . " <P> Stung by mounting criticism and concerned about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of economic emergency in September , banning strikes , profiteering and the distribution of news or information deemed to be injurious to the economy . The regime was also worried about a possible counterinsurgency led by supporters of the deposed Somoza and other anti-Sandinista groups . Meanwhile , the government increased its attacks on COSEP . Junta Member Sergio Ramirez charged that the organization espoused " a systematic defense of the most primitive type of capitalism , which tries to paralyze the revolution , to resuscitate forces which hinder the revolutionary process .
