No one accused the bankers of stealing Christmas , but their decision last week was not exactly conducive to holiday cheer . Leading U.S. banks boosted the prime lending rate from 10% to 10.5% , the highest level since May 1985 and the fourth increase so far this year . For consumers who hold adjustable-rate mortgages or home-equity loans , in which payments are tied to the prevailing trend , last week 's upward lurch in the prime was about as welcome as the Grinch . <P> Led by Chase Manhattan , bankers were responding to what they see as a relatively tight credit policy on the part of the Federal Reserve Board . Under Chairman Alan Greenspan , the Fed has allowed rates to rise because of its concern that the economy is expanding fast enough to kindle inflation . <P> While the economy grew at a relatively modest 2.6% annual rate during the third quarter , the expansion actually amounted to 3.2% if the effects of the summer drought are excluded . That level of growth , while not quite inflationary in normal times , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Unemployment in the U.S. has remained at low levels , though the Government reported last week that the jobless rate for November inched up to 5.4% , compared with 5.3% the previous month . Factories were operating at 84% of total capacity , the highest level since February 1980 . <P> Another key reason for the rising interest rates is the federal budget deficit , which is expected to total $137 billion in fiscal 1990 . Paul Volcker , the former Fed chairman and now a Wall Street financier , warned a congressional commission last week that unless the Government reduces its huge borrowing needs , " there is the risk of a real financial disturbance . It would bring about the kind of recession that would be the most difficult to handle . " One way in which the deficit has triggered higher rates is by undermining foreign confidence in the dollar , which plunged more than 3% against the Japanese yen in the three weeks after the U.S. election .

Harold Goldberg of Chicago , a 52-year-old accountant who last year took out a $20,000 home-equity loan , estimates that his monthly repayment will rise $40 this month , to $183 . Says he : " I 'm just grateful that I did n't borrow any more than I did . " <P> By most accounts , the Fed is attempting to nip inflation before it buds , a policy some economists believe could be dangerous . Says Sidney Jones , a professor at Georgetown University 's business school : " The Federal Reserve is overreacting to the risk of what it perceives as an overheated economy . I do n't think it 's there . " Adds Edward Yardeni , chief economist for Prudential- Bache Securities : " I hope Greenspan does n't do too good a job of keeping the lid on , because it could cause a recession .
