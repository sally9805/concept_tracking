txt WHAT A SHAME , that we shortchange ? the anniversaries of great moments in history : Take , for example , last week 's bicentennial celebration of the epochcl Battle of Yorktown . The world knows that French President Francols Mitterrand met President ? Reagan at Yorktown , Va. , to commemorate the defeat of the British army in the climactic battle of the Revolutionary War . Individuals who bothered to read an extra paragraph or two also learned that Mitterrand was there because a band of tenacious French troops fought alongside ? Gen. George Washington to whip the Redcoats , who were under the command of Lord Charles Cornwallis . The celebration evoked great memories for me of grammar school history teachers who dramatically had us relive the battles of Lexington , Concord , and Valley Forge and Paul Revere 's midnight ride . But what we did n't hear about in our ' school days or in last week 's news accounts was the personal story of the great French general who led the French troops at Yorktown , Marquis do Lafayette . LAFAYETTE was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the , battlefield . He was a humanist . ' Had the Founding Fathers listened to him , as well as to certain American patriots such as Thomas Payne and Benjamin Franklin , there probably would never have been a Civil War . , Marquis de Lafayette thought it contradictory that Americans would fight a heroic war , with such great sacrifices of white and black bodies , only to perpetuate hu , man bondage in the form of chattel slavery . He was not alone in noting the moral contradiction , Individuals from all walks of life could see what Abigail Adams recognized before the Revolutionary War began . The wife of the second President of the United States , John Adams , noted in 1774 that " it always appeared a most iniquitous scheme to me to fight ourselves for what we are daily robbing and plunder. ing from those ( the slaves ) who have as good a right to freedom as we have . " Lafayette was serious about ending and correcting the evils of slavery . On Feb. 5 , 1783 , the marquis wrote Gen. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that you are going to enjoy some ease and quiet , per ' mit me to propose a plan to you , which might become greatly beneficial to the black part of mankind . Let us unite in purchasing a small estate , where we may try the experiment to free the Negroes , and use them only as tenants , Such an example as yours might render it a general practice ; and if we succeed in Amer- ? Ica , I will cheerfully devote a part of my time to render the method fashionable in the West Indies . If it be a wild scheme , I had rather be mad in this way , than to be thought wise in the other task . " GEN . WASHINGTON did not reject outright the Lafayette proposal . He suggested that action be deferred . On April 5 , 1783 , Washington responded : " The scheme , my dear marquis , which you propose as a precedent to encourage the emancipation of the black people in this country from the state of bondage in which they are held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart . I ' shall be happy to join you in so laudable a work , but will defer going into a detail of the business till I have the pleasure of seeing you . " Lafayette got no cooperation from Washington , but the marquis did establish a pilot program at Cayenne in French Guiana . On May 10 , 1706 , Washington wrote Lafayette a letter praising the Cayenne colony as " noble proof of your humanity . " ( The colony was broken up and the Marquis thrown in prison after the French Revolution . ) As to the new nation 's posture on slavery , Washington wrote Lafayette that " would to God a like spirit might diffuse itself generally into the minds of the people of this country ! But I despair of seeing it . . . . " To set the slaves afloat at once would , I really believe , be productive of much inconvenience and mischief ; but , by degrees it certainly might , and assuredly ought to be , effected , and that too , by legislative authority . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him with these words : " In the case of my blaCk brethern , I feel myself warmly interested , and most decidedly side , so far as respects them , against the white part of mankind . Whatever be the complexion of the enslaved , it does not , in my opinion , alter the complexion of the crime which the enslaver commits ? a crime much blacker than any African face . It is to me a matter of great anxiety and concern , to find that this ( slave ) trade is sometimes perpetrated under the flag of liberty , our dear and noble stripes , to which virtue and glory have been constant standard-bearers . " THE PERPETUATION of bondage after a war for independence was doubly grinding against the humanism of Lafayette because he had a chance to see ' blacks fighting and dying and winning honors in nearly every great battle of the Revolutionary War . ? Several black soldiers fought with him , and one slave named James was Lafayette 's key espionage agent during the siege of Yorktown . In 1786 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , later the legislature awarded him 5100 and an annual pension of $40 . The newly freed James gave himself the name James Lafayette . What Marquis de Lafayette wanted , and what Washington , Jefferson , and the other Founding Fathers understood , was freedom for a whole people rather than for just one or two individuals . Martin Luther King enunciated the lesson from that period in a speech nearly 180 years later : " Justice delayed is justice denied . "
