Pittsburgh goalie Greg Millen isn ' t complaining about the 80 shots - 42 last night and 38 Tuesday - he has faced in two games against the Bruins , and who can blame him ? It ' s good work if you can get it , and a little more than a month ago , Millen could not . Penguin coach Johnny Wilson had benched Millen - with the Penguins slumping - and called up Nick Ricci from the minors . " Some people might have thought I wasn ' t doing the job , " said Millen last night , " but that ' s water under the bridge . I ' m not thinking about that now . It ' s playoff hockey . " Millen ' s fall and rise is a touchy subject in the Pittsburgh dressing room , for the simple reason that he may have been the fall guy for a general collapse . Now , after Millen kept the Penguins close in a 4-1 loss last night that left the Bruins and Pittsburgh even ( 1-1 ) in this best- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can go it alone . " There is no way you can let the opponent get off 40 shots and expect to win , " said Gregg Sheppard . " Not unless you score five or six goals yourself . " And yet , there seems to be little concern that Millen won ' t continue doing as he has . " He ' s capable of better , " said Penguin winger Rod Schutt . " Really , he didn ' t have the year he wanted to - he had a pulled hamstring that slowed him down - and now he ' s just starting to play like he did in the past . " Millen ' s performance last night was not quite as faultless as his Tuesday virtuoso . He second-guessed himself on two of the four Boston goals . " On the first one ( Rick Middleton ' s ) , I gambled a bit , " said Millen . " I probably should have stayed back in the net more because Middleton is so tricky . He made a good play . " On the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried to intercept the pass ( from Peter McNab ) , and I got a piece of it , but Marcotte was able to tip it up . " On the third one ( Brad Park ' s ) , I didn ' t get a look at it at all . " Park ' s goal , from the right point , was typical of the Bruins ' attack . Many more of their point shots were getting through to Millen than had been the case Tuesday . " Their forwards were doing a better job of pinching our wingers onto the boards , " said Penguin forward Ross Lonsberry . Lonsberry doesn ' t think the Penguins will change their tactics much tomorrow in their own arena - that is , they will continue to throw the puck out of their own end and wait for the Bruins to pour back in . " We can get by with it as long as we get good goaltending , " said Lonsberry . Question is , can Millen keep it up ? " The playoffs are 75-80 percent goaltending , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the years we won in Philadelphia , we got it . You just have to get it . " No matter whether we win or not , we have to remember that Millen is maturing a lot . This is his first playoff experience , and he ' s going to be better for it next year , regardless of whether he gets beat or not . "
