A " Welcome Back , Harry " tale , and other jottings on The Great Experiment . . . Harry Caray returns to work on Tuesday , and that parade of personalities who tried to replace him will slip into the musty pages of history . There , they will join folks such as Dizzy Dean and Joe DiMaggio , Glenn Campbell and Charley Pride , Chuck Connors and all those others who took their turns as guest announcers back in the early ' 70s . Their platform was the NBC Monday night baseball booth , and their presence was intended to do nothing more than hype that series . Some , such as Dean and DiMaggio , worked just fine with regular network broadcasters Curt Gowdy and Tony Kubek . Others , such as singer Campbell , worked out not so fine . ( " He would have been okay if he could have played his guitar , " Kubek remembers . ) And then there was former " Rifleman " Connors , who ended up spicing his appearance with the most egregious of TV ' s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on with the telecast until there was a natural break . " Did he say the no-no word ? " he then whispered to Kubek . Kubek nodded affirmatively and then whispered to Connors , " You just said the no-no word . " " It was like a Marcel Marceau routine , " Kubek remembers . " Then Curt started laughing so hard , he had to get up and go to the back of the booth . Connors followed him , and right then the director showed a shot of the booth . I was the only one there and so he yells at me , ' Do play-by-play . ' That ' s how I got to do play-by-play on the network for the first time . When the inning ended , you know what Connors said ? ' I thought there was a seven-second delay ( between his speaking and the words going out over the air ) . ' "  --  Give the man a box of Havana ' s finest : Steve Stone , that legendary aficionado of cigars , never confronted such an outlandish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jim Belushi joined him for the telecast of a Cubs-Padres game . San Diego shortstop Garry Templeton was the comedian ' s inspiration , and he asked Stone : " Didn ' t he get in trouble in St. Louis ? Didn ' t he give the finger to the fans ? " Recalls Stone : " I put my hands over my face and then said : ' No , Jim . The fans misinterpreted his gesture . He was saying the Cards were No. 1 . ' That was one of the highlights . " In fact , Stone ' s own work can well be considered the highlight of Caray ' s absence . He studied up on the amateur partners he would shepherd through a game and was able to guide them to subjects they could discuss uninhibitedly . He patiently tutored his amateur partners before they joined him on the air and was able to smooth over their shortcomings when they failed to heed his teachings . He carried telecasts when his amateur partners were struck mute , yet was able to give loquacious ones such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brands of zaniness . He was a caretaker for crazies and newspaper columnists and actors , for former players and professional announcers , yet he inevitably handled the diverse personalities with unflappable aplomb . It was , frankly , a wonder that he was able to simply keep the names straight , but he did it while still giving you the score and game situation . " It has probably been the most unusual experience in my life , " he says . " As I ' ve said before , I got 30 years of broadcasting experience in six weeks . In that respect , I enjoyed it . " I also came to appreciate the genius of Harry to make 7-0 games interesting to listen to . Anyone can do a 6-5 game with the Cubs winning in the ninth , but out of 162 in a season , you maybe get 30 of those . The rest of them are not horribly interesting for long stretches , and you can ' t let them speak for themselves . They ' re not saying anything . That ' s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s the most entertaining guy in the business . " I am happy I went through this . As far as experience is concerned , it ' s been wonderful . But I am sorry the experience came at the expense of Harry ' s health . I ' m glad he ' s coming back . And I hope he comes back and broadcasts for the next 10 years. "  --  He ' ll pass his cigars around : While the bouquets are being tossed about , Stone suggests  --  and I agree  --  that some should also go to Arne Harris and Jack Rosenberg . Producer and director Harris , says Stone , " pretty much led ( the guest announcers ) by the hand and made suggestions to them on what they could talk about . He deserves every accolade you can give after coordinating that kind of broadcast game after game . " Rosenberg , the coordinating producer of those telecasts , greeted the visiting talent , led them through the Cubs ' locker room , introduced them to the players and generally did all the stroking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Both of those guys helped make a real difficult situation as smooth as possible. "  --  And finally , he-e-ere ' s Harry : " I hear Harry was out eating Italian food , so I know he must be feeling pretty good , " Stone concludes . " I also understand he ' s lost 35 pounds , so I know he must be starting a campaign to gain a few back . I also know May 19 will be one of the most special days the park has seen in a long time . " I was thinking of giving him a kiss in the opening ( of his first telecast back ) , but I don ' t know how he ' d react to that and I don ' t want to throw him off . I ' ll just be real , real happy to see his smiling face again and to hear him do baseball again . " Amen.
