It is a grand office and a grand desk , as befits the head of one of the world 's great opera companies , and at first glance the two objects near the telephone appear incongruous . One is a sign that reads THE BIG TONE . The other is an unopened can of Alpo dog food , a gift from his staff . <P> In fact they , more than the gilt and the grandeur , sum up the job and the personality of the man who holds it . Anthony Bliss is indeed the Big Tone , the general manager , ultimate authority on everything that occurs at the Metropolitan Opera . And he is also totally committed to his company , so oblivious to almost everything else that he probably could , as his wife once jokingly observed , dine on Alpo dog food and not know the difference . <P> The Met was always a big organization , but during Bliss 's eight-year stewardship it has become a much bigger one , the General Motors of the world 's opera companies . A Wall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York society , Bliss has brought the practices of modern business management to what is , and will always remain , an artistic endeavor . <P> In large measure , he has succeeded . When he took over in 1974 , the deficit was $500,000 and rapidly mounting , threatening the troupe with eventual extinction ; last season , despite a budget of $63 million , the Met had a $100,000 surplus. * " We have to raise an enormous amount of money , more than $20 million in annual gifts , to keep the company going , " he says . " Since I 've been here , fund raising has grown from one man with a couple of secretaries to an office that will soon have 30 or 40 people . " <P> In almost every way , managing the Met is more complicated than it was a decade ago . " It used to be that people bought their tickets at the window , " Bliss says . " With the advent of the credit card , most of the purchases are on the telephone . Our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buying a lot of tickets each year to many more people buying a smaller number . In the early ' 50s we had around 8,000 subscribers . Last year we had 28,000 . All of this means a great increase in administration . " <P> Despite his background of Groton , Harvard and Wall Street , Bliss , 69 , almost grew up in the opera house . His father , Cornelius Newton Bliss , was the president of a textile firm . He owned a box in the grand tier , the so-called Diamond Horseshoe , of the old Metropolitan Opera House , and he was chairman of the board from 1938 to 1946 . Anthony attended his first performance when he was six , hearing Enrico Caruso in I Pagliacci , and when his father died in 1949 , he was automatically offered a seat on the governing board . " I was aware of the kind of problems that faced opera for as long as I could remember , " he says , " and I suppose that I got my knowledge of opera by osmosis . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 39th Street , which was built in 1883 , was outmoded , and Bliss became a chief proponent of a move to a new structure in Lincoln Center . He won his argument , and the company journeyed north in 1966 . But following a feud with Rudolf Bing , the Met 's impresario from 1950 to 1972 , he was pushed aside as board president . When Bing 's successor , Schuyler Chapin , failed to curb the escalating deficits , Bliss was brought in as a salaried executive to put the house in order .
