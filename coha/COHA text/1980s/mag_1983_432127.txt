 | After defying one congressional subpoena and dodging another , Rita M. Lavelle finally defended herself before Congress last week , denying under oath that she was guilty of any impropriety as head of the Environmental Protection Agency 's $1.6 billion toxic-wastes cleanup program . But Lavelle 's long-awaited testimony ? and her surprising , stinging charges of gross mismanagement at the agency 's highest levels ? were nearly eclipsed by her own former employers . In a frantic effort to control damage from the spreading EPA controversy , EPA Administrator Anne Gorsuch ? fresh from a new marriage and a change of name to Anne McGill Burford ? flew to Times Beach , Mo. , where she informed residents that the government had decided to spend $33 million to buy out their toxics-poisoned town . Then the administration abruptly announced the forced resignations of two high-level EPA officials ? and there were indications that other dismissals would follow . But the " Wednesday-afternoon massacre " failed to quiet the continuing storm over the EPA . Although there were still no specific charges of wrongdoing , the Justice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of political malfeasance and conflict of interest in the administration of the Superfund for toxic-waste cleanups . The White House , after abandoning a plan to appoint a Superfund commission , continued its own internal inquiry to determine whether the program had been manipulated for political purposes . And NEWSWEEK has learned that congressional leaders are now pressing for an investigation into whether Attorney General William French Smith and U.S. Attorney Stanley Harris may have committed what Rep. Elliott Levitas called " impeachable offenses " by refusing to honor a contempt-of-Congress citation against EPA chief Burford ( page 18 ) . Meanwhile , White House aides worried that the EPA scandal would focus new attention on Ronald Reagan 's environmental policies . As one aide said , the environment is " a motherhood issue in this country " ? a life-or-death matter that affects everyone , from babies not yet conceived to the most elderly . It is one of the few issues , especially in the form of toxic wastes ( page 20 ) , that is literally in the voters ' backyards , and recent polling for the Republican @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ negative " for Reagan ? though people still do n't hold him personally responsible . A new NEWSWEEK Poll shows that opposition to Reagan 's environmental policies remains high ; 47 percent of respondents disapprove of his policies ? compared with 40 percent a year ago ? and only one in four  | believes he has helped environmentalists . " Our environmental policies are not politically profitable , " concedes a top aide . " People want clean air and clean water . " Unfortunately , such basic concerns ? along with the looming national nightmare of toxic wastes ? have been obscured for months by the administration 's dogged fight to withhold EPA documents from Congress . Instead of cooperating with several House subcommittees investigating charges ranging from " sweetheart " deals with business to political manipulation of the Superfund program , the administration argued that congressional access to all EPA documents might jeopardize ongoing enforcement efforts and were therefore protected by executive privilege . Congress promptly cited Burford for contempt but the Justice Department , instead of sending the Burford case to a grand jury , unsuccessfully disputed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted a test case , and they got it , " says House general counsel Stanley Brand . " But it shows bad judgment and poor legal advice . " Obstructing Justice ? Some White House aides blame the constitutional struggle on inexperienced Justice Department lawyers , who in their view invoked executive privilege too quickly and left the White House to defend the principle in a case that did not warrant it . But critics charge that the administration 's real motive was to limit Congress 's oversight functions ? which , given the proliferation of subcommittees claiming jurisdiction over the executive branch ( 44 over the EPA alone ) , has a certain plausibility . An even more sinister view is that the Justice Department , in refusing to respond to the Burford contempt citations , may have been trying to protect the administration at the expense of enforcing the law . Attorney General Smith , says Brand , may even be guilty of obstructing justice . EPA documents were delivered piecemeal last week to six separate subcommittees , but investigators still had more questions than answers . Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the EPA 's hazardous-waste division after Congress subpoenaed scores of documents ? and were they ever used to destroy important records ? Was EPA Inspector General Matthew Novick fired last week because he may have used government employees to do personal business ? or because he recently released an audit critical of the EPA 's handling of its Superfund records ? And why did President Reagan exert executive privilege over EPA documents he admits he had not read ? " Where there is so much smoke , " says House Republican leader Robert Michel , " there is surely a little fire . " There was no shortage of congressional investigators trying to find it . For example , Rep. John Dingell 's Energy and Commerce Investigating Subcommittee studied allegations that EPA officials manipulated the Superfund for political purposes . The panel began to subpoena 36 EPA employees last week to testify on the Stringfellow Acid Pits , a 24-acre dump near Riverside , Calif. , which may have been deprived of Superfund cleanup funds by EPA officials who did n't want to aid Democrat Jerry @# I.  | Brown 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subcommittee concentrated on James W. Sanderson , a Denver lawyer charged with possible conflicts of interest for working at the EPA while continuing to represent private clients ? including a large chemical-waste company that won a $7.7 million EPA contract last October despite findings that it had tried to cover up its own pollution problems . Sanderson , charged Florio , " could be the smoking gun . " Suspected Spy : But the main congressional focus last week remained on Rita Lavelle , whose abrupt firing as chief of the EPA 's toxic-waste program earlier this month became the lightning rod for the controversy . Lavelle vehemently denied any wrongdoing and deftly defended herself against charges that she may have been too cozy with the chemical industry . She was fired , she said , because Burford suspected her of spying for the White House and because she had allegedly written a memo ? actually drafted by a Lavelle aide ? that identified the business community as " the principal constituents of this administration . " Burford , said Lavelle , " thought I had written this memo .. . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and keeping book ' on my fellow political appointees . " " Were you ? " asked Colorado Sen. Gary Hart . Lavelle only laughed : " I should have , I think . " Lavelle 's most serious allegations during her 10 hours of testimony were aimed at her former EPA boss . Burford , said Lavelle , was " always responding to grenades after they 'd been launched " and had never established a chain of command within the agency . The result , said Lavelle , was disorganization and internal splits , exacerbated by the lack of experience of most of the agency 's top managers . " I never saw that strong direction from the top , " said Lavelle . " There was no management . " But Lavelle also insisted that she " saw no abuse " and that her controversial policy of negotiating settlements with toxic-waste dumpers instead of taking them to court was dictated by Burford ? and presumably by the White House as well . " I thought that was the philosophy we were supposed to be following , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " negotiate first , litigate second " policy is very much in keeping with the Reagan philosophy . But even as the president rails against regulation and the strangling of free enterprise , he also considers himself a card-carrying environmentalist ; his off-the-cuff " if you 've seen one redwood you 've seen them all " remarks must be balanced against the toughest-inthe-nation air- and water-pollution laws that he signed as governor of California . Unfortunately , the lesson of the EPA ? and its hazardous-waste policies ? is that the president 's goals of environmental protection without excessive government regulation may be incompatible , especially if entrusted to overzealous political appointees with their own ideological axes to grind . But Reagan did little last week to set things right . The much-heralded " fresh start " for the embattled agency fell considerably short . EPA critics were quick to point out that the first two " requested resignations " involved nonpolicymaking personnel , and that their replacements were for the most part unknown to the environmental community . Former Carter administra-@#  | tion EPA official William Drayton , head of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the EPA middle command is merely " an attempt to have less politically vulnerable people continue the policies of getting the regulatory monster off the backs of industry . " The growing consensus ? even among White House aides ? is that Reagan can defuse the current situation only by asking Burford to resign ? or to offer her a facesaving ambassadorship . " If I were president , " said one congressional aide , " I 'd ask for the resignation of the entire team and accept the lot , with regrets . " ' Credibility ' : The president showed little willingness to follow that advice last week , even though many fellow Republicans urged him to do so . " It is not in the best interests of the Republican Party for the credibility of the EPA 's commitment to environmental protection to remain in doubt , " wrote GOP moderates James Jeffords of Vermont and Claudine Schneider of Rhode Island in a " Dear Colleague " letter to House Republicans . The EPA scandal , said the letter , has already come " dangerously close " to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and White House aides worried that environmentalists might mobilize against the president should he decide to seek a second term . " They tried to get us on social security and they did n't , " said a White House aide of the Democrats ' knack for seizing on a campaign issue . " Now they smell something here . " Almost to a nose , it smelled rotten . But even in the absence of solid evidence of wrongdoing , some Democrats worried that the fractious controversy surrounding the EPA scandal could eventually cripple the once respected agency . The solution , they said , was to strip the executive branch of the power to control the EPA , and last week bipartisan legislation was introduced that would make the EPA , like the Nuclear Regulatory Commission , an independent entity run by a five-member , bipartisan commission . The move , said cosponsor James Scheuer , one of the subcommittee chairmen investigating the agency , would " remove EPA from the extreme ideological swings of policy and practice that have degraded and politicized the agency 's work product . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hazardous-waste-disposal programs is that they are , in the words of one congressional aide , probably the EPA 's " best-run programs . " That may come as frightening news to EPA critics in Congress , which still faces a host of other volatile issues under the embattled agency 's jurisdiction : besides the Superfund , only one other piece of legislation administered by the EPA has not expired . As a result , Congress must tackle reauthorization for everything from the Clean Water Act to the Clean Air Act ? and it 's possible that all environmental legislation may simply languish if Congress , mired in the spreading scandal , finds itself unable to reach compromise . Another possibility is that current congressional investigations might actually turn up evidence of wrongdoing within the EPA . In that case , Congress would continue to exercise its oversight functions to the fullest ? and in doing so , would run the danger of permanently politicizing one of the most important issues facing America today .                 @ @ @ @
