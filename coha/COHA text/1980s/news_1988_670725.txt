Mr. Franceschi , who was born in Puerto Rico in 1948 , has been showing in New York since 1971 , when Terry Dintenfass included him in a group exhibition . Grants have come his way ( most recently from the New York State Council for the Arts ) . But a serious retrospective is something else altogether , and this one is well worth the trip. // Crossing the threshold , we see first a mixed-media object called " La Creation du Monde . " Worked up over six years , it serves as a mascot or flagship for the show as a whole . William Olander in the catalogue tells us that it includes the artist ' s palette " atop a folding stool , combined with a portion of a painting , a blue bird , and something that resembles a gold box which just might belong to Pandora. " // As that suggests , the piece is dense to the point at which it is not easy to read . But while Mr. Olander ' s description is correct , it omits the implications @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what we see is not simply a collection of emblems in high favor with the artist . Nor is it about " the creation of the world " in an everyday sense . It has to be , and surely is , a salute to the French painter Fernand Leger , who collaborated in 1923 with the poet Blaise Cendrars and the composer Darius Milhaud on a ballet called " La Creation du Monde . " Except for the gold box - Leger hated gold , and Mr. Franceschi can ' t get enough of it - item after item in this complicated piece relates to Leger ' s idiom. // Once past the flagship , we come upon a group of mixed-media sculptures that touch in an epigrammatic way upon the current concerns of art . One has a pseudo-Latin title to the effect that painting can feed on the energies of sculpture ( or possibly the other way around ) . Another brings the message that " to paint is to love again . " A third , called " The Sorrows of Young Werther , " involves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foliage pierced by an arrow . Once again , there is fractionally too much gilt , but this is a piece that makes a genuine , if oblique , allusion to the early novel of Goethe that for most English-speaking people now lives more vividly on the operatic stage ( thanks to Massenet ) than on the printed page. // My favorite in this series is a piece called " The Precise Contemplation of a Platonic Solid Is Also a Form of Rest . " It consists of a tall column , complete with plinth and topped by a pile of books . ( All these things are painted , sometimes thickly . ) Balanced at an impossible angle on the top of the books is a big , old-fashioned tin jug , mottled and speckled . Out of the jug , at an angle of 45 degrees , blue and white milk pours itself high in the air . It is an elegant , provocative , neatly realized piece. // All around , meanwhile , are paintings . Many of them are about Gustav Mahler and are named after his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the podium , life-size , in one of them . In others , the reference is more cryptic . Mozart is there , too - the portrait of him is a telling likeness - in a painting called " Why Can ' t Painting Be More Like Music ? " Given the profusion of musical references in this exhibition , and the unsteady level of Mr. Franceschi ' s efforts as a painter , this is a very good question. // On the present state of painting , Mr. Franceschi has some good things to say , by implication , in a painting called " The Tenant of Modernism . " There may be a little too much , in this , of the compound idiom lately employed by Jasper Johns . ( A Johnsian severed arm appears elsewhere in the show . ) There is only one Johns , and Mr. Franceschi has nothing of that magical , long-pondered touch . But Mr. Franceschi has a readiness to get on the mat with both the present and the past of painting . He also has a fund of high romantic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different context is proved by one of the original stage sets that he designed for " Salammbo , " as produced by Charles Ludlam and his Ridiculous Theatrical Company in 1985 . In every way , Mr. Franceschi is a good man to have around . But perhaps the surrealizing compound object is his forte , after all - witness the one called " The Perspective of the Moon With the Boring Parts Left Out . " That title raises great expectations , and Mr. Franceschi lives up to them. // " Edgar Franceschi : In Dreams Begin Responsibilities " remains at the Museo del Barrio , 1230 Fifth Avenue , at 104th Street , through Dec. 4 . The show was made possible by a grant from the Ford Foundation . ' The Paintings of Ribalta ' Spanish Institute 684 Park Avenue ( at 68th Street ) Through Dec. 8 It is a remarkable turn of events that has brought to the Spanish Institute a large group of paintings by Francisco Ribalta ( 1565-1628 ) , a Catalan painter who was educated in Madrid and spent almost all his working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been saved from international oblivion by American enthusiasts . Delphine Fitz Darby , in 1938 , and David Martin Kowal , in 1981 , published substantial studies of Ribalta that won him among English-speaking readers a secure , if minor , place in the canon of Spanish 17th-century paintings. // So there is a certain justice in the arrival in New York of a show that includes several of his most important paintings and a number of others that we must normally seek out not only in the Prado in Madrid , but in parish churches in and near Valencia as well . Ribalta is a difficult man to get hold of , and this is our chance to do it. // From an unbeliever ' s point of view , he lived at a gloomy time . The church and its representatives were his only patrons . Valencia in the first quarter of the 17th century was in the grip of the Counter-Reformation . As one Spanish historian writes : " A mood of tense calm prevailed , and life was ordered by the tolling of church bells . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the optimism of humanism was only a distant memory of its forbears . " This was a climate in which Ribalta had to hew very closely to the line laid down for him by his patrons. // Doubtless for this reason , the work is heavy on martyrdoms and often disagreeably exact in their portrayal . But the show also includes the comparatively festive portrayal of " St. James at the Battle of Clavijo . " Not only does this set a welcome note of exuberance in a largely somber show , but it sets a new standard of nicely managed congestion in Mannerist battle pieces. // Ribalta was as alert as he could be , given his provincial location , to what was being done in other parts of Europe , and the show includes the careful copy of a large painting by Sebastiano del Piombo that is a key document in Ribalta ' s development . ( Though now in the Hermitage in Leningrad , this was in Valencia in Ribalta ' s day . ) If as a young painter he was undeniably jumpy ( " eclectic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ managed in later life to negotiate the transition from Mannerism to Baroque with considerable skill. // He can also be ranked as one of the pioneers of Spanish naturalism , and in the " St. Francis Embracing the Crucified Christ " at the Spanish Institute , there are intimations of a rich and full humanity as well as of delight in the possibilities of curious detail . ( A happy example of this is the leopard , crowned with gold , on whom St. Francis stands . ) This is a show that goes way beyond the normal confines of a cultural institute and will be of interest to everyone who reponds to Spanish 17th-century painting . <> <> ' Joseph Stella : The Tropics ' <> Richard York Gallery <> 21 East 65th Street <> Through Nov. 12 // Though best known as the rather heavy-handed poet-in-paint of the Brooklyn Bridge , Joseph Stella ( 1877-1946 ) was at least as much at home with tropical fruits , flowers and birds . Not only was he at home with them , but he also empathized with them , lived their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down there , as he said himself , " My energy , drained and martyred by the horrible icy North , reawakened as if by magic. " // Tropical fruits gave him an erotic charge that he was happy to acknowledge both in his writings and in paintings like several of the ones in this exhibition . These are images in which Joseph Stella gave his all , such as it was . Buoyed and bolstered by major museum loans , this show is of a quality not seen every day in a relatively small private gallery. //
