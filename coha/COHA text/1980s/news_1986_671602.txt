Most of those now preparing for the heart of the fishing season - and I am one - are such fellows . We are diligently attending to loose or cracked rod guides , reels whose guts are laden with sand or rust , dull hooks on lures and frayed or weakened lines . But this will come to little if we don ' t - and we probably won ' t - show our courage at the sticking point and boldly ignore our society ' s conventions. // Unless one is a hermit , the social pressures against truly dedicated angling are intense . If you are a young parent with a small child or an aging parent with a grandchild , you will feel an urge - or be urged - to take the little one fishing . Such an act is one of the king posts of the family structure , but its drawbacks are almost overwhelming . Little Johnny or Little Suzie tire quickly and grow bored with even greater rapidity . And if what promised to be a halcyon day grows dark , cold , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whimpering to go home or , worse yet , be shivering uncomplainingly beside the roaring surf . No one can ignore a silent , shivering child. // Such familial roles can sometimes be shared if you have a bachelor friend who likes to fish and in his middle years has become possessed by the notion that he was wrong in allowing his desire for freedom or his fear of commitment to rob him of the delights of parenthood . If he gives the slightest hint that he yearns for at least a semblance of such sustenance , lend the little darling to him. // A major difficulty in successfully blending love for family and a desire to angle is that fish aren ' t receptive to one ' s offerings at all hours of day or night . One can , for example , plan to jog or play tennis between 8 and 10 on a Saturday morning without disrupting the traditional family outing . Following a similar schedule , the fisherman will often catch nothing and be told by those of his ilk already on hand that he should have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by rising at 4 : 30 , but that would have rendered him a sleepy-eyed curmudgeon for the remainder of the day. // In summer in seacoast resort areas , one can observe the cocktail party ' s insidious corruption of angling . In general , assuming the tides are somewhere near the ideal phase - and that ideal varies from spot to spot - the best hours for surf fishing are dawn , dusk and thereafter . On any shimmering August afternoon , dozens of four-wheel-drive vehicles will be lined up at known fishing hot spots , front bumpers facing the ocean , while some of their occupants flail the water with scant success and the others toss plastic disks at each other or recline on huge towels , their cacophonic radios obliterating the murmur of waves sliding up and down the beach. // The serious angler unfamiliar with this scene might drive away in disgust because there obviously isn ' t room to fish , but that would be a mistake . More than an hour before sunset , there will be a general exodus . By the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tumbling water , most of the departed anglers will be indulging in idle chatter on crowded patio or porch , and there will be all the room in the world for those who remain. // Forthright shirking of cocktail engagements requires no great amount of guts , but it ' s much more demanding to inform spouse or hostess that during the summer you will not sit down to dine before 10 at night . In truth , the 10 o ' clock deadline is cutting it close , leaving you only about an hour after leaving beach , lake or stream to get home , clean your fish and yourself and dress for the occasion ; 11 would be more civilized. // Those who are self-employed are often the most accomplished anglers . My brother Dan , a house painter , is one of them . He paints as he fishes , with astonishing speed and skill , and those who have worked with him delight in describing his habits. // He will , they say , be going full tilt in the next room , whether drawing sash with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minutes with a roller , when , without slackening , he begins to mumble such things as : " The tide is right at Black Rock " or " Those damned stripers were close to shore off the Head at this time last year. " // Silence follows , and the next sound is that of his truck driving away , headed up-island where his boat is moored. // " You fish when they are there , " he says , an approach that can not be challenged. // But most of us , linked as we are to regular hours and the usual commitments , will continue to be dilettante anglers , making anticipation and preparation for our occasional forays a major part of the sport . Plodders thrive on planning for the future . More than 35 years have passed since I made my living as a carpenter , but even now if I dull a saw or chisel on an unseen nail in a piece of old wood , I can not let two days go by without resharpening the tool . One never knows when one will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the inveterate anticipator gains great pleasure from acquiring a new piece of equipment designed to speed up the ritual whose end is infrequently consummated . I am savoring the thought of the arrival of Berkley ' s Outdoorsman , a device powered by two flashlight batteries that is both a hook sharpener and a line stripper . I care not for its first function ; I use a hone or a file for that . But its line-stripping function will be a boon . For years I have dreaded the laborious business of pulling old monofilament line off reels , particularly those that hold more than 200 yards . This so exasperated me one spring that I tied a sinker to the unwanted line and cast it across a greening meadow . Choosing a heavier sinker , I got rid of all the line on a second cast , and then thinking of some bird or animal getting entangled in it , I spent 15 minutes pulling it all back , hand over hand. // When my Outdoorsman arrives , it will spew the line into a wastebasket , emptying even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gaining me time to varnish my creel or mend my minnow seine. //
