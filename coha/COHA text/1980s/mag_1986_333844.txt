On the playground , where the move counts as much as the basket , " winners ' out " is the rule . Score the hoop , keep the ball . Win the game , maintain the court . Hold out until dark if you can , or at least until twilight . <P> Julius ( " Dr. J " ) Erving , the most watchable basketball player of the past 16 years , has begun to say goodbye to cities : Portland , Seattle , Oakland , Phoenix . At final stops along the Philadelphia 76ers ' way , home teams have been introducing their own players first in order to build a crescendo for Dr. J , the National Basketball Association star who plays for everyone . <P> " Each arena holds its own memories , " says Erving , who was not thinking of wine or golf clubs when he announced on opening day that this will be his final season . Dr. J 's best going-away present has been the sight of the Phoenix fans bedecked in surgical caps and masks for his last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old moves and a lot of old players , " he says , " because they should be savored . These buildings house so many ghosts . " <P> With a quarter of the season gone , the revamped Sixers are neck and neck with the Boston Celtics , as usual . Since Center Moses Malone transferred to Washington , bulky Forward Charles Barkley has become the dominant figure . After Maurice Cheeks , a whirlwind guard , Erving , at 36 , continues to perform probably the third most important role , shifting almost exclusively to the backcourt . By his standards , Dr. J 's game has become subtle and subdued . " Man makes plans , " he says . " God laughs . " But he can still play . <P> A scout for Indiana , Dave Twardzik , notes the new economy of Erving 's moves , and smiles . Before Twardzik was a starting guard for an N.B.A. champion in Portland , he was a substitute for the Virginia Squires of the old American Basketball Association , headlined in the early ' 70s by an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I only played 20 minutes a game , and I did n't mind , " Twardzik says , " because I could sit and enjoy Doc . I remember thinking ' They 're paying me to watch this guy play . ' On the bench , we 'd elbow each other and whisper , ' Did you see that ? God , did you see that ? ' " Gravity never had any pull with Dr. J. <P> Partly because the 76ers are new , but mostly because the finish is near , Erving feels like a Squire again . " The ending has the same innocence attached to it that the beginning did , " he says with some surprise . " I feel light and free . The way I played basketball was never about bringing attention to myself , but it was always about proving myself . I 'm not forgetting the job at hand , but , honestly , I feel relieved . " At just 6 ft. 6 in. he has been the MVP of two leagues , scoring nearly 30,000 points along the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Baylor out of Connie Hawkins , and Erving is considered the inspiration for Dominique Wilkins and Michael Jordan . " But are n't comparisons always unfair ? " he says . " I 've borrowed from every player I 've ever seen , from the little guard with the two-hand set shot to the big center with the slam dunk to the forward defending the passing lanes like a free safety . What separates a player , if anything does , is just the few things he adds that are his own . "
