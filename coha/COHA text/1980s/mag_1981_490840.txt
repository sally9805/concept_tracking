Notes and Comment WE have received our friend the lady : I thought if I got the three words " cold and sunny " into a first sentence , I could write you a letter . And there you are . I did it . I have no news , only a few observations , and they are not even random observations . They are very so id observations , and if I am not careful they will hem me in and eventually turn into secrets , and then , worse and worse , into convictions . Thirty minutes later . 1 went off to make some coffee for myself , and while I waited for the water to boil I considered all the non-random " observations " I had so portentously lined up for your inspection . While I looked them over , they began to vanish , and finally they had all vanished  --  all gone , and a good thing , too . They would have made very dull reading . They were a stilted crowd , and rather disagreeable , as though they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 'd expected and where their clothes were all wrong . They all wore elaborate taffeta ball gowns that seemed to belong to the eighteenth century , and each ball gown was a different shade of green . They vanished one by one , but their departure seemed sudden , and I think now that they were n't observations at all but complaints , and , if so , they have gone into the complaints department , where I never look around at all . I am never to be found anywhere near the complaints department . There are too many mirrors in there for my liking . The complaints department becomes empty every once in a while  --  stonecold empty , and quite deserted . I always know when it is empty . When I am happy , I know that it is empty . That is , when I am especially happy . Furthermore , I believe that all the unhappy ones in there in that dismal department then turn into angels , or into something like angels , and go far , far away . Yesterday afternoon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bryant t Park , I saw a three-cornered shadow on the pavement in the angle where two walls meet . I did n't step on the shadow , but I stood a minute in the thin winter sunlight and looked at it . I recognized it at once . It was exactly the same shadow that used to fall on the cement part of our garden in Dublin , more than fifty-five years ago . We lived in that house thirteen years . It was one of a long row of houses that faced , across the quiet little street , another long row of houses , just like them , each with a little front garden and a good-sized back garden . Every time my father came into the house , coining home , he went first into the back sitting room to look through the big window at his wife 's garden and see for himself what changes she had made there during the hours he had been away . I celebrated my fifth birthday in that house , and I also celebrated-my seventeenth birthday there , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closer to seventeen than seventeen is to five . What do you think of that ? And , of course , all my birthdays between five and seventeen were celebrated there . The birthdays of all of us were celebrated with presents in the morning and a very special hirthday-cake high tea in the evening . One New Year 's Eve , something marvellous happened on our little street . It was n't called a street ; it was called an avenue . Cherryfield Avenue . And it was closed at the far end  --  no " thru " traffic . What happened that New Year 's Eve was that in the late afternoon word went around from house to house that a minute or so before midnight we would all step out into our front gardens , or even into the street , leaving the front doors open , so that the light streamed out after us , and there we would wait to hear the bells ringing in the New Year . I nearly went mad with excitement and happiness . I know I jumped for joy . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our lives . I must tell you now that I am praying to Almighty God for blessings on your house , with extra blessings to go with you whenever you leave the house , so that wherever you are you will be safe . Blessings on your house . Happy New Year . T he Librarian of Congress DANIEL J. BooRsTIN , the Librarian of Congress , is a compact man with close-cropped hair and a rich , inquisitive voice that quavers with eagerness to express his ideas . If his words came out in Teletype , there would be no spaces between them . The card catalogue of the Library of Congress has forty-three entries for its present Librarian , in which he figures as author , editor , or subject , in English , Spanish , or Japanese . He has won the Bancroft Prize , the Parkman Prize , and the Pulitzer Prize for History  --  each for a different book  --  and has held the Preston and Sterling Morton Distinguished Service Professorship of American History at the University of Chicago , which he left in 1969 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Institution 's National Museum of History and Technology . A half decade after his induction as the twelfth Librarian of Congress , we visited Boorstin , to find out why he took the job , what it has taken from him , and how both have fared . " Before I accepted President Ford 's nomination , my wife and I needed a month to reflect on the offer , " Mr. Boorstin said . " I considered myself a writer . Still do . I want to he a writer when I grow up  --  I consider that my ambition . I had launched on a world history , partly as a project of self-education , and I wondered if I should not devote full time to it . My wife and I wandered anonymously in the Library . In the manuscript room  --  this seems as if it were scripted , but it 's true-  - -  we came on an exhibit about the selection of Librarians by Presidents . In it was an exchange of correspondence on the selection of Archibald MacLeish . F.D.R. wrote to Felix Frankfurter asking for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad time picking a Librarian to succeed Putnam . What would you think of Archie MacLeish ? ' MacLeish , you know , was not a professional librarian . Frankfurter wrote back , ' What is wanted in the directing head of a great library is ' imaginative energy and vision . He should be a man who knows books , loves books , and makes books . ' I knew Felix Frankfurter and admired him  --  found him a stirring man  --  and I decided to accept the President 's nomination . " I was aware that the Library had great treasures . One of the themes of my books is that culture in a democratic society has a special role to play  --  especially in the New World  --  as a catalyst for learning . I wanted to make certain that the Library was more than a warehouse  --  that it was also a wellspring for the discovery of culture . My first object was not to make things worse . The Library was a sound institution , with good staff . But I wanted to open it up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been closed for some time , so the public could come into the Great Hall of this beau tiful building instead of coming into the basement , some people objected . You 'll create a draft , ' they said . That 's just what I wanted to do . I wanted to draw people in ! " Since last spring , the Library 's new James Madison Building has drawn people in , as have the Thomas Jefferson Building , a Beaux-Arts palace , where Boorstin works , and which was the only Library of Congress from 1897 until 1938 , and the John Adams Building , which has been an annex to the Library since 1938 . More than a decade in construction , the Madison , which is just south of the Jefferson , dwarfs most other buildings in Washington . Boorstin admits that the Library must give the Madison Building a more human scale , but he accents the opportunity it provides to draw the three buildings together . In Boorstin 's scheme , the Madison Building will eventually contain most of the administrative offices and will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , musk , and recordings , in special conditions of humidity , light , and temperature . The Jefferson and Adams Buildings will gather books , incunabula , and other legible stock near reading rooms ordered by regions of geography and knowledge . In halls that were once cluttered with makeshift quarters for a sprouting staff , the Library now puts on exhibits  --  the first of which celebrated the return of the Jefferson Building to its Italian Renaissance glory . The Jefferson Building 's Main Reading Room is a grand rotunda , shown from its dome  --  a hundred and sixty feet up  --  in the movie " All the President 's Men . " The room will serve as the index for the Library in its role as a Circle of Knowledge . ( In conversation , lectures , and books , Boorstin capitalizes the ideas he wants to stress , and he has done the same in naming the symbols of change at the Library . ) The metaphor of the Circle , we learned , holds the origin of the word " encyclopedia " and denotes a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideas for the Library  --  the Center for the Book , the Council of Scholars , the Multi-Media Encyclopedia  --  expand the scope of the Circle . Boorstin offered us a Montecruz cigar , lit one himself , and , when it went out , gestured with the cigar in one hand and a lighter in the other , without lighting up again , throughout our talk . " When I arrived , certain things were obvious , like the role of automation and the machine , " he said . " The information industry was flourishing , and the Library of Congress had a lead in diffusion of information . But what would happen to the Book in all this ? The Book , after all , is a form of technology , although most people do n't recognize the fact . One form of technology is not an enemy of another . A new technology should help us discover new roles for the old . I wanted to End new ways for the Book and the Computer to be compatible , and so we started the Center for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the world of learning ? This , after all , is a learning institution . The Council of Scholars is the answer . In the past , scholars doing research at the Library have often been unaware of what others were doing , within their fields or outside . The Council will have twenty-five members , representing all fields of knowledge , who will deliberate twice a year . They will pursue their own research , and they will counsel the Library . The thing that inspires me  --  the grand feature of the Council  --  is that the members will be in a position to inventory the state of mankind 's knowledge and ignorance . They will tell us what we do and do n't know  --  about anything . " The Multi-Media Encyclopedia was a natural concept . There are two problems for a great library : excess and access . It would be hard enough if we had to contend with a flood of material in only one form . But we have material that is multilingual and multiform  --  all records of civilization . Students of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ posters . I wanted to organize the Library to entice people from one form to another , to get the benefit ? the payoff  --  of these special collections . " For the Library of Congress , we discovered , the problems of excess and access are huge . The number of items received by the Library in a single day is more than the number of volumes ( about sixty-five hundred ) that " Lunch is ready . Would you call in our godclam extended family ? " Congress purchased from Thomas Jefferson in 1815 as the core of the collection after the British had used the Library 's original books as kindling to burn the Capitol the year before . The Library now has more than seventy-six million items . One of the world 's largest gatherings of books , in four hundred and sixty-eight languages at last count , makes up just a quarter of the holdings , and only one-third of the books are in English . Since 1870 , the Library has protected the work of American artists , musicians , writers , and , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of copyright deposits , about half of which go into the vast store . To keep foreign collections current , the Library now buys through seven offices and a large number of other representatives around the world . A staff of fifty-seven hundred , supported by an annual budget of two hundred and ten million dollars , orders the flow of arrivals and reserves so that information wo n't frustrate the quest for knowledge . Among the staff 's other tasks is answering the calls of various constituencies : first , Congress ; second , the nation ; finally , - the rest of civilization . The Library fields more than a thousand requests for help from Congress each day . Library staff people attend sessions of congressional committees to keep up with the country 's business . Experts in a variety of subjects , they also strike out on their own to chart intellectual territory they expect Congress to cover . American or not , anyone may use the Library , although there are limits on who may borrow from the collections . For those who ca n't come in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ copies and mails research materials . Recalling Boorstin 's ambition , we said we wondered if his responsibili ties  --  to provide all knowledge in all forms and the freedom and resources to pursue it  --  leave the Librarian any time to write . " You know , " he answered , " in my confirmation hearings , before the Rules Committee , Senator Claiborne Pell , who has been chairing the Joint Committee on the Library , said he hoped that I would not write another hook while I was Librarian . I told him I saw nothing wrong with the Librarian of Congress being involved with scholarly pursuits , and I got confirmed . Before I accepted President Ford 's nomination , I called Archie MacLeish and asked , ' Should I take the job ? ' He asked me , ' How much sleep do you need ? I need eight hours a night , which is too much if I am to write and do anything else . ' It 's a piece of luck that I do n't need much sleep . I take little naps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was at my desk at six I 26 JANUARY 5 , 1981 o'clock this morning  --  which is early , but not as early as Jefferson . Anyway , I was determined to write after I came here . I do all my writing before I come in to the Library , and I 've managed to finish fifteen of the eighteen parts of the world history  --  still untitled  --  that I 've been working on for fifteen years . I 've tentatively subtitled the history The Rise of the Exploring Spirit , ' and I hope to have it out in two or three years . " We asked how long Boorstin plans to stay on as Librarian " Well , I certainly hope this is n't my last assignment , " he said . " And I do n't see a ratio between the length of a Librarian 's tenure and his contribution . Archie MacLeish was here only five years , and he was one of the great administrators of the Library . I do n't know of any institution that has suffered because an able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the shine is off . " Resumed WE dropped in at the Metropolitan Opera shortly after the settlement of the labor dispute that had delayed the opening of the season , and can report that the atmosphere was crackling with artistic energy . Four operas and a choral work were in simultaneous r e - hearsal , and the mood of the staff was a mixture of wariness and relief . Although the main issues that divided the company have been settled by a contract that everyone can live with , the breakup of the fragile network of personal relationships that makes an opera house function really well will take considerably longer to repair ; for example , a number of choristers and musicians boycotted the official Christmas party . If the house is more impersonal these days , it is also more efficient . Support facilities ( security , mailroom , supplies , and page service ) have been centralized , and such non-artistic operations as fund-raising , merchandising , and ticket processing have been strengthened . ( " When they hired all those data processors and put in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Motors approach to opera , " one disconsolate singer remarked . ) The artistic staff , which is beginning to feel a bit outnumbered , is also going through a reorganization , caused by a change in the status of John Dexter , the brilliant and mercurial director of production . As Mr. Dexter relinquishes most of his administrative duties ( he is to remain as a consultant and a director of opera ) , there will be a reshuffling of authority among a new managing triumvirate , consisting of Anthony Bliss ( executive director ) , James Levine ( music director ) , and Joan Ingpen ( artistic-administration director ) . But , despite these tremors and aftershocks , the company seems to have pulled itself together professionally in record time . In List Hall , a hundred choristers had just started to rehearse the final movement of Mahler 's " Resurrection " Symphony ( an unfamiliar work for an opera chorus ) , which was scheduled for opening night . When they reached the fifth bar , David Stivender , a scholarly-looking man , who is the Met 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stopped the singers and asked them to fix their minds on the chord that had preceded their soft a-cappella entrance . " You 're going to hear a lot of silence after the orchestra cuts off , " he said , " and I want you to remember the feel of the G-flat chord , so this will stay in tune . " The chorus tried again , and Mr. Stivender stopped them a second time . " I think now it 's breath , " he said . " This is the hum of the universe ; the effect must be ' Where 's it coming from ? ' so you must start by taking a deep silent breath , and then , somewhere along the line , sound comes out of it without a jolt . And color also comes in gradually . " The chorus began a third time , singing " Iluferstch'n , ja , aufersteli'n wirst du " in a heavenly near-whisper , and Mr. Stivender , looking pleased , continued without a pause to the triumphant climax of the symphony . " It sounds healthy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way , " he said when they had finished . " Now , remember , when the music fades away at the end , there should be no doubt in any Face . Was it a dream ? No , it was n't a dream , This is n't Korngold or Steiner . This is Mahler ; it 's the original . " Down in a sub-basement rehearsal room , Fabrizio Melano , a stage director , was directing Cornell MacNeil , as the troublemaking Tonio , and Patricia Craig , as Nedda , the wayward wife , in the commedia-dell'artc scene from " Pagliacci . " As Mr. MacNeil , playing a lovesick servant , burst through the curtains of a rustic stage set , Miss Craig registered disgust and pretended to kick him . There was a chorea-graphed struggle over a molting gray chicken ( stuffed ) that Mr. MacNeil produced from a basket ( " This is the Jon Vickers memorial chicken , " he remarked during a musical pause ) , and some comic business with four china eggs that Miss Craig , not without difficulty , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you tie the chicken 's legs together to make it easier to handle ? " inquired Mr. MacNeil after Miss Craig had dropped one of the eggs . ) When the scene ended , Mr. Melano jumped up on the stage and walked through Nedda 's movements with Miss Craig , who was new to the production . " You go for the chicken , you do n't get it , you get it , you cross and take out the eggs , " he said . " Then , when he say 's Sei pure , ' you give him a really dirty look . " On the second floor , Nathaniel Merrill , another stage director , was rehearsing Hansel and Gretel 's near-fatal encounter with the wicked witch . First Hansel ( Brenda Boozer ) and then Gretel ( Judith Blegen ) was immobilized by a magic spell cast by the witch ( Rosalind Elias , flourishing a trick wand that sprang from her hand when it was released by a concealed spring ) . Then the witch offered the children a slightly singed birthday cake . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miss Boozer , " hut they do n't go out , because they 're made of a special substance that keeps burning . We have a glass of water in the center of the cake , in case things get out of hand . " " Where do I get rid of the wand ? " asked Miss Elias . " You drop it when you burn your fingers testing the oven , " replied Mr. Merrill . " Then you go into the house , and another witch flies through the air on a cable during that very Wagnerian witches ' ride . " On leaving Hansel and Gretel and the witch , we passed a ball where Poulenc 's " Dialogues des Carmelites " was being rehearsed , and headed downstairs to the main auditorium , where we found Mr. Levine conducting the Metropolitan orchestra in the melodramatic last moments of Alban Berg 's " Lulu . " A scream indicated Lulu 's offstage murder in a shabby attic , and Mr. Levine , with a great wave of his arms , swept the musicians into an apocalyptic shudder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ killer  --  who turns out to be Jack the Ripper  --  appeared in a doorway and stabbed Lulu 's friend the Countess Gescliwitz , leaving the dy ? ing woman to gasp , " Lulu ... I will stay near you for eternity . " The curtain fell . Mr. Levine put down his baton and looked happily at the musicians . " Bravo , " he said " We 've come a long way . Now , folks , let 's keep that ending very intense , Do n't let those last three bars get too light , and make sure that the main rhythmic figure is maintained even when it 's not very loud . " As the musicians began to pack up their instruments , we asked Mr. Levine why he had chosen " Lulu " ? which is something of a gamble in terms of the operagoing public  --  as the first opera of the present season . " It was originally scheduled for this period , " he said , " and the cast remained intact . And , with the ' suppressed ' third act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the operas written in twentieth-century musical terms , Lulu ' is the great , towering masterpiece . It was written on a very large ? scale , and it makes an incredibly communicative effect if it 's presented properly . We 've had many rehearsals , and I still think it 's one of the hardest scores I 've ever seen . The music is highly organized , very dense , very detailed , and the orchestral fabric is a great tapestry of leitmotivs that are both rhythmic and melodic . There is also a main rhythm  --  a structural element that occurs many times throughout the piece . Berg was fascinated by structural details  --  symmetrical forms , symbols , numbers , quotations  --  but they were not ends in themselves . He regarded them as stimuli that led him to the extressive use of these elements . A lot of the forms he used in ' Lulu ' are classic , and his musical language  --  even though it is sometimes atonal , sometimes twelve-tone , and sometimes chromatic  --  is really only a very natural extension of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "
