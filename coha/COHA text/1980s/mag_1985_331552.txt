A generation ago , mainstream Protestant churches began clustering their national agencies in New York City . With such institutions as the U.N . and the National Council of Churches already in place , Manhattan seemed the ideal base for forward-looking church leaders . Now , for various reasons , four major denominations are simultaneously pondering whether to pull up stakes . The underlying trouble is not New York 's reputation as Sin City  --  except insofar as liberalism is counted a sin . Churchgoers on Main Street are increasingly concerned that the left-of-center New York bureaucracies are out of step with heartland beliefs . <P> " There 's been a massive reaction by people in the pews against the very well-meaning New York boards that they never see , " says Martin Marty , religion historian at the University of Chicago . A westward shift , he thinks , would be aimed at putting " the leadership in close touch with the way people are actually thinking . " The Rt . Rev. Paul Moore , Episcopal bishop of New York , counters that it is vital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the intensity of the social problems are right there under your nose . " <P> The Episcopalians and the United Church of Christ have each scheduled formal discussions this year on the site problem ; in each case , however , the national staff and Eastern establishment probably have the clout to forestall any move . The newly merged Presbyterian Church ( U.S.A. ) will decide next year where to locate denominational headquarters , and some believe the majority will be against New York . Three Lutheran branches are also merging , and in September a committee will probably recommend a midwestern city for the new headquarters . <P> Various cities are already lobbying to land the potential New York refugees . No one is doing so more actively than the persuasive mayor of Indianapolis , William Hudnut III , a Presbyterian clergyman who helped engineer the nighttime raid of Baltimore 's Colts last year . His city is already home to the Christian Church ( Disciples of Christ ) , and Hudnut is quietly but insistently hymning the praises of Indianapolis to various Protestant officials . Some church staffers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shuddering at the prospect of a town that once kiddingly called itself Dullsville . Even if none of the restive churches wind up in Indianapolis , Protestant laity throughout the country may well agree with Mayor Hudnut when he says , " Some of the very , very liberal people who seem to dominate the bureaucracies and organizational structures of these denominations might learn something from us.
