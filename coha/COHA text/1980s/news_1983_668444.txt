In the two decades since James Bond movies began delighting the world , only two actors - Sean Connery and Roger Moore - have played the deadly , dapper Special Agent 007 . This summer they ' ll be in competing films , with Moore playing Bond in " Octopussy , " and Connery returning to the role he created for " Never Say Never Again . " But each Bond epic has boasted its own villain , starting with Joseph Wiseman as Dr. Julius No , and including Gert Frobe as Auric Goldfinger , Telly Savalas as Ernst Stavro Blofeld and Yaphet Kotto as Mr. Big . The turnover in villains , of course , is a tribute to Bond ' s markmanship , which is nearly on a par with his connoisseurship when it comes to vodka martinis and voluptuous women . By the end of a Bond movie , not much is left of the megalomaniacal villain , to say nothing of such memorable sidekicks as Lotte Lenya , Robert Shaw and that dentist ' s nightmare - Richard Kiel - as the over-endowed Jaws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bond adversary is Louis Jourdan as Prince Kamal Khan in " Octopussy , " which was recently filmed at the Pinewood Studios . " The key to the villain in a Bond picture is that he must be a parody of a villain , " the distinguished French actor , best known here for the movie version of " Gigi , " was commenting in his dressing room just before donning his tuxedo for a characteristic encounter with suave 007 . " It ' s my job to make villainy as attractive as possible ; as charming , quick-witted and viciously intelligent as a man must be to take on Mr. Bond . " Above all , a Bond villain must have a sense of humor about his own foulness . To put myself in the proper mood I think of Mephistopheles on a comic-strip level . " I think this picture is very well conceived . The danger , after a dozen Bond movies , is slipping from format to formula , but here , within the formula , there ' s room for inventiveness . " A reserved , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the classics or the French theater or a television commercial - with the utmost seriousness . This doesn ' t stop him from trying to have fun with his roles and convey a sense of that fun to the audience . " In Octopussy ' I play an Afghan . In order to use as little makeup as possible , I spent lots of time in the sun and at least an hour a day in front of a sunlamp . " That was very boring , but I have a Walkman with a collection of classical tapes that I ' d play . You could call it music to fry by . Now that the early Verdi operas are all being recorded , they were my happiest discovery under the sunlamp . " I ' ve been doing commercials for the past 10 or a dozen years . I take them so seriously that I participate in the original concept and the actual writing . After all , whatever an actor is doing , he ' s a salesman , so why not commercials ? " I must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ve never done a play I didn ' t like , but one often does movies just to keep functioning . They ' re less important to me than plays . " Yet Jourdan is one actor who doesn ' t panic if the next part isn ' t lined up . He estimates that in his 40 years as an actor , at least half of them have been spent " at leisure . " But in his case it ' s a conscious choice , not an occupational hazard . " Here in England I get special pleasure from listening to Benjamin Britten and reading the most divine , ideal and perfect book I know , Ruskin ' s Sesame and Lilies , ' which I first read many years ago in Proust ' s French translation . In fact , I reread more than I read . " In it , Ruskin says books are our best friends , never bothering us , but just waiting there on the shelf until we are ready for them . " Music is even more important to me than books @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ music every day . I find it therapeutic , beside being a great joy . Musicians are my psychoanalysts - there ' s no grief , pain or difficulty that isn ' t totally erased by listening to good music for a while . " " Unlike most of my actor friends , I ' m not at all anxious the moment I don ' t work . I suppose I ' m just not as ambitious as they are . Some will stop at nothing by way of strategy , publicity or exposure to get a job . " But I ' ve always been very negative to the idea that a career is developed in public . The work of an actor is developed in private ; it has nothing to do with publicity . " Jourdan ' s private time is largely spent reading great literature and listening to great music . On his coffee table is a first edition of Thomas Love Peacock ' s 1861 satire on romanticism , " Gryll Grange , " which he recently picked up at one of the secondhand bookstores along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I suppose you could call it , is to read the literature and listen to the music of the country I happen to be in . " Now that Jourdan ' s English is up to reading Ruskin in the original , he finds he also prefers acting in English to French . " The language is still exotic for me , so I have a passion for it . I ' d love some day to speak it as perfectly as Gielgud . " I know a French accent is supposed to have a special charm for English ears , but no French actor I knew , including Maurice Chevalier and Charles Boyer , ever deliberately used his accent to sound sexy . " Chevalier simply couldn ' t speak better English than he did , and Boyer studied English very seriously with Charles Laughton when they were playing together in Shaw ' s Don Juan in Hell ' on Broadway . " I personally regret the so-called charm ' of my accent , and only wish I could control it better than I do . "   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
