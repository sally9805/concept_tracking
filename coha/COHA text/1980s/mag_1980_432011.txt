 | ON A COLD AFTERNOON Nikola Tunov squatted in the dust of the square of Gorna Sushitsa and with a stick stirred a pot of hot tar and pine oil . He was surrounded by a group of young men , mostly his relatives ( a corncob thrown in this village will likely hit a Tunov ) . They passed around a jug of red wine . From time to time Nikola would intercept the jug and throw back his head of black hair . His hands were large , and cracked and raw . Throughout the winter ( this was November ) . Nikola and his work brigade climb the steep slopes of the Pirin mountains to cut oak for their stoves and fence posts for the big agro-industrial complex of which this village is a part . The men wear no gloves . Nikola uses the tar solution to treat cuts on his sheep , but it has not escaped his attention that it also repairs his sore hands . A truck rattled into the square ? a twoand-a-half-ton Soviet GAZ 51 . Stoyan Lavurov jumped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gasp . It appeared to have been driven mostly down dry riverbeds . Stoyan is the truck jockey for the village , hauling wood to the sawmill in the valley . Bulgarians seem reserved , but Stoyan had the sort of wild abandon that pressed the GAZ to achieve flight . Nikola referred to the condition of his hands . " So why do n't you cover them ? " asked Stoyan . " With what ? " " They call them gloves . " Nikola rubbed some tar into his palms and spat in the dirt . He and Stoyan laughed . Most towns in Bulgaria have a square around which stand the municipal building , a hotel , a restaurant , and a statue commemorating either the Russian liberators or the local partisans who fought the proGerman government during World War II . Gorna Sushitsa has only the square , and a mayor with the only telephone . It rarely rings , the national government having chosen not to include Gorna Sushitsa in its plans for present or future development . Thirty years ago there were 900 people living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old Bulgaria , there are maybe 180 , largely lonely grandparents . Most of the children , as happens over much of this rapidly industrializing  | country , have left for jobs in the cities . Behind Nikola was a little whitewashed church . ( The Bulgarian Orthodox Church is a branch of Eastern Orthodoxy , its independence circumscribed by the state , its attendance hesitant . ) The houses were of stone , timbers , and whitewashed bricks of mud and straw ? solid homes , roofed in red tile , separated by dirt paths . Nothing in Bulgaria ? even in spare Gorna Sushitsa ? suggests a slum . The apartment complexes would win no design awards , but the homes are neat , well built , and often artistically painted , and , when they can afford to , Bulgarians add on . In the windows hung strings of red peppers , and beside the houses tobacco leaves dried under tents of plastic . At night each family pens its stock in mangers abutting the houses . In the morning a shepherd ( the job rotates ) moves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The music recalled for me a day when I was invited by a shepherd with a small mustache and the endurance of an ox to go with him up into the Rhodopes to his cabin . He was a gentle , wiry man who  | would lean on his staff , going " shh , shh , shh , " as he softly lobbed snowballs to keep the sheep on the move . He handed me a tin of cold yogurt that melted in my mouth like fine ice cream . That night I slept in a room full of sweet wool under what seemed like fifty pounds of Rhodope blankets , waking to the aroma of steaming chicken , shipkaberry tea , and the scent of pines in snow . THE VILLAGE of Gorna Sushitsa perches on an open slope facing out over tobacco fields . Below is the hazy Struma Valley , and beyond , Greece and Yugoslavia . Behind the village the Pirin rise above trees in shadow into rugged peaks . About a third of Bulgaria is mountainous ? the Pirin , Rila , Rhodopes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whose novelists and poets romanticized the exploits of the haiduks , or Bulgarian outlaws , harassing the Turks in the mountain passes . The Ottoman Empire administered Bulgaria for five centuries , conscripting boys into the Janissaries ? the sultan 's elite troops ? and women into the  | harem . Toward the end of Ottoman rule , the empire had become inefficient and corrupt , encouraging a Bulgarian identity and the will to assert it . When the uprising finally ignited in 1876 , the Ottoman irregularsbashi-bazouks ? quickly crushed the peasants and their few cannon of hollowed cherry logs . The massacre began . J. A. MacGahan , an Ohio journalist , rode into Bulgaria on a horse . In one village he found mounds of decomposing bodies , most of them women , children , and old men . He was told of babies spitted on bayonets , of women repeatedly raped in front of their children , and of children raped as well . Survivors told of being forced to carry around the severed heads of their brothers and sisters . MacGahan 's lurid accounts shocked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to march against the Turks . Bulgaria was liberated in 1878 , but thousands of Russian soldiers lay dead in the fields , a debt the Bulgarians have not forgotten ? and for which they are still paying . AFTER 36 YEARS under Communism , Bulgaria has accomplished much it is proud of : a growing economy , miles of paved roads that before the war were just donkey trails , and a broadened system of schooling ( though heavy on the sort of indoctrination that asserts that the U. S. Supreme Court has " always acted in support of the rich " ) . But when Bulgarians turn on the radio or television , they learn first of the latest Soviet , not Bulgarian , accomplishment . The November 7th parade in Sofia , celebrating the Russian Revolution , consists of thousands of people carrying carnations , accompanied by orange Balkancar forklifts bearing huge photographs of Brezhnev , Lenin , Marx , and Chairman Todor Zhivkov , the nation 's leader and First Secretary of the Bulgarian Communist Party for 26 years . All march past the tomb of Georgi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embalmed like Lenin . Zhivkov and other high officials stand in dark woolen overcoats on top of the tomb , giving little waves , while a cheerleader with a megaphone reminds the paraders what they are to shout up to the tomb : " Long live friendship between Bulgaria and the Soviet Union " How well this official affection goes down with Bulgarians is difficult to measure . Of all Eastern European countries , Bulgaria is clearly the most loyal toward the Soviet Union . They share similar languages and the same alphabet ? and Bulgarians remember who freed them from the Turks But I found little enthusiasm for Zhivkov 's statement that Bulgaria and the Soviet Union are but a single body , breathing with the same lungs . BY 10 A.M. the winter sun had reached the rocky hillside where Nikola and his brigade were chopping down the oaks ? six men in the black wool trousers and rubber slippers you see throughout the villages of Bulgaria . Nikola stripped off his sweater and picked up his bradva , an ax with a short handle of beech . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others , " you 're chopping too close to each other . " From time to time on the upstroke Nikola would spit on his thumb as it passed , but the swing , smooth and powerful , was without interruption . Judging from the amount of grape brandy Nikola had tossed down the night before , I half-expected to find him supine under a tree , holding his head . But there he was on the side of the mountain . with a swing like Willie Mays . He was all business as he worked ; conversation soon flickered out . The oaks dropped quickly , for they were small and spindly . There are nice pines in the Rhodopes and Rila , but despite extensive replanting many of the forests of Bulgaria , particularly in the Balkans , are stunted . Big oaks in the Rhodopes were felled for supports in the mines . Shepherds burned out forests for sheep meadows . which eroded in the rains . Timber is so scarce that much of it is imported from the Soviet Union . In Siberia more than 10,000 Bulgarians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trees . Toward late afternoon Nikola and the brigade filed out of the mountains , leading their donkeys heaped high with cut oak . They stacked it by the road for the GAZ , which emerged from the village , lurching its way up the ridge . I got the impression that there are more  | trucks than cars in Bulgaria . The highways are adequate , and surprisingly free of collisions considering that Bulgarians delight in passing on corners and hills . I drove around in a Soviet Lada , which appeared to be a Fiat put together in dim light . Despite the assembling of Czech and Soviet cars at plants in Plovdiv , most Bulgarians still ca n't afford one ; Gorna Sushitsa has only the GAZ . The cities , however , are well served by trolleys , and there is bus service everywhere . In the villages you still see Bulgarians riding in rubber-tired carts pulled by donkeys ? hauling firewood in winter , in summer heading for the fields . And everywhere in the country ? it is practically a national pastime ? Bulgarians walk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to engage the village poplars . Atanas , Nikola Tunov 's brother , was in the cellar replenishing a flask of brandy . Vangalia , his wife , was splitting firewood in the yard . The pungent cellar was strung with ears of corn and piled with beets , pumpkins , and potatoes . From a churn Atanas broke off a brick of white sheep 's cheese and from an oak cask drew a pitcher of red wine . These villagers derive their income mainfrom tobacco raised on lands of the complex , but each family is allowed to grow and harvest its own grapes and sell its wine . Last year Atanas and Vangalia made almost a thousand leva ( roughly equivalent to 51,000 ) selling wine to a German television crew , who , in a nice twist on Hollywood 's habit of passing off the hills of Santa Monica as Spain , were using Gorna Sushitsa for a film about Mexico . Bulgaria is a large exporter of wine , much of it produced on the big complexes . Few homes , however , are without an arbor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Tunovs ' little kitchen was tight , and the wood stove puffed it with heat . The rugs were covered with a sheet of clear plastic . Nothing is paved within about five kilometers of Gorna Sushitsa , and the chickens run free , so shoes come off at the stoop . The walls were white and bare , except for a nail behind my head where Atanas hung his watch . There was a low cupboard in the corner , a small table , a few chairs , the stove . The sheep 's cheese was good with the grapes , big sweet golden ones that popped between my teeth . The grape brandy was n't bad either , less incendiary than slivova , the plum brandy Bulgarian officials press upon visitors . After weeks of limp meals of pork and veal and lukewarm soups in gloomy restaurants , I was grateful for Vangalia 's lamb stew , swimming with rice , onions , and tomatoes . Atanas and Vangalia were in their fifties . His bad health had slowed him down , but she was inexhaustible and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recede . I filled my glass and offered some to Atanas . He shook his head sideways and said " Da . " I had set the pitcher down before remembering that in Bulgarian a nod means " No " and a headshake means " Yes . " Later Vangalia poured us mugs of forest tea into which she ladled four heaping tablespoons of sugar . Bulgarians are on such a sugar jag that they pour strawberry syrup and lemon pop into glasses of wine . Bulgarians are frugal , and those in the mountain villages quite self-sufficient . From the wool off their sheep and goats they weave blankets and rugs , knit socks , and make heavy trousers and skirts . They grow and raise most of their food , canning for the winter , buying only some rice , salt , sunflower oil , sugar , and maybe bread . Bulgarian bread , a bit flat to my taste , is heavy and resilient . In the Rhodopes I saw a stale loaf chucked out the window of a speeding car . It hit a guardrail , bounced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , quite intact , removing , I suspect , chunks of macadam as it whanged along . The mountains are covered with sheep , but lamb is almost never found in the markets or in restaurants . It is exported to the Italians and Arabs . About the only meat Bulgarians can buy is pork and veal , and they watch the markets carefully . Weeks often elapse without any meat deliveries other than lukanka , a favorite sausage of Bulgarians , but at $5.50 a pound strictly a delicacy . For all the abundance of fruit and vegetables in the fields and hothouses , I saw little evidence of them in the markets aside from canned goods and cabbages the size of medicine balls . The best Bulgarian foods are  | exported to the Soviet Union , Eastern Europe , West Germany , and Scandinavia to help cut Bulgaria 's deep trade debts and to get hard currency . It would appear that foreign-exchange markets are aware that Bulgarian toilet paper is considerably tougher than the lev . Bulgaria covets hard currency . Not only must she pay pounds sterling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Balkancar , she is also increasingly pressed by the Soviet Union , from whom she imports most of her raw materials ? including almost all of her crude oil ? to pay up in hard currency , not leva . The economy , like everything else in Bulgaria , is run by the government ; wages and prices are mandated , jobs defined and controlled . The average Bulgarian earns the equivalent of about $1,800 a year and pays relatively high consumer prices ? $350 for a small refrigerator , $500 for a color television set . To conserve diminishing imports of Soviet oil , the Bulgarian Government last year doubled the price of gasoline to four dollars a gallon . The government does n't raise prices ; it " adjusts " them . Windshield wipers are locked in the trunk to avoid being stolen . Parts of all kinds are either unavailable or in short supply . Bulgarians have to stand in long lines for products often not worth the wait . " The shoes break your feet before the leather breaks in . " Savings earn only one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the past two years , while productivity went up 6 percent , wages increased just 3 percent . Pay and promotion often depend less on effort than on political obedience . " We pretend we 're working , " goes the saying . " They pretend they 're paying us . " I was often reminded of Bulgaria 's high proportion of working women by the predawn growl of water trucks outside my hotel , as husky women in blue coats snaked out high-pressure hoses to wash off the streets ? and , incidentally , blast any cars parked there . In the face of a low birthrate and labor shortage , government planners exhort Bulgarians to marry and have children . In case the message is missed , single people under 30 must pay an extra 5 percent income tax ? 10 percent if still unmarried after reaching 98  | 30 . Mothers earn a premium of five dollars a month for their first baby , twenty dollars for the second , and fifty dollars for the third , and their pensions begin earlier . After dinner Vangalia dialed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Skopje , the capital of the Macedonian republic in Yugoslavia . Because of their Macedonian heritage , Bulgarians in the Pirin listen regularly to Macedonian folk music from Yugoslavia . What is often referred to on the Balkan 100 Peninsula as the " Macedonian question ' Ls , not a question at all . It is a century of failures by Bulgaria ? in the Balkan Wars , and again in both World Wars allied with Germany ? to regain all of Macedonia and territories south to the Aegean , where Bulgarian shepherds once wintered their flocks . Bulgarians say that the people in Macedonia are Bulgarian . That sends the Yugoslav into near apoplexy . The Yugoslays assert that Macedonians are Macedonians , and that Georgi Dimitrov as much as said so . In recent years the Bulgarian census suddenly showed few Bulgarians in the Pirin being counted as Macedonians . It might help explain the Kalashnikov submachine guns bristling on their tense frontier to recall that the Yugoslays did n't call this simply a case of census manipulation ? they branded it " statistical genocide . " In any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TodoZhivkov still has trouble convincing the Yugoslays that Bulgaria no longer has territorial ambitions . At 2 a. m . I was awakened by the crowing of the Tunovs ' rooster . The full moon had ruined his sleep , so he had decided to share his misery with the rest of the village . Soon every rooster in town was shouting about the moon . I went outside . Mist had seeped into every ravine of the Pirin , giving , in the moonlight , the appearance of a coastal range indented by the sea , and drawing the Yugoslav frontier uncomfortably near . Earlier I had asked Atanas whether he considered himself Macedonian or Bulgarian . " I am Bulgarian . " I went back to bed and dreamed of fried rooster . A TRAVELER tends to carry his first impressions like crystal on a tray before him , just inviting the outstretched foot . In winter the cities had seemed only grim and forbidding , places of drab concrete crumbling at the edges , of dimly lit buildings and heavy drapes , of colorless rooms hung with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the men and women huddled quietly in restaurants choked with cigarette smoke , chasing brandy with Coke . I had assumed that they were mourning the waiters , National Geographic , July 1980  | who , being state employees like the store clerks , tend to regard customers as an inconvenience to be dealt with by inattention bordering on a terminal coma . Shops would close on a whim . Nothing seemed to work . So with some misgivings I returned in May to Sofia , but the city had lost the oppressive solemnity of winter . The smog had lifted , revealing Vitosha 's slopes rising verdant right out of the suburbs . I crossed Ninth of September Square , which was rimmed with bright pansies , its yellow Viennese bricks shimmering in the sunlight . A breeze was up , and the streets and parks were jammed with young couples and families strolling , old pensioners hopping through calisthenics ? a city on its feet . Sofia is a big city , but socially a small town , the gossip , as everywhere in Bulgaria , getting amply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we stroll through Liberty Park to the restaurant at the Pliska Hotel . The park was lovely , full of chestnuts and high poplars , ending in a handsome forest . It was also immense . The Pliska was two miles away . The next morning I wandered into Sofia 's massive Alexander Nevski Cathedral , climbed a marble staircase , and pulled up a chair beside the balustrade in the choir loft , surrounded by garish frescoes ? artistic visions of heaven and hell . I could barely see @#  | the deacon far below at the altar , but I had no trouble hearing his strong baritone . Out of Bulgaria have come some world-class opera singers ( Boris Christoff once sang in this choir ) . There was no organ , no piano , only a tuning fork , which the director tapped from time to time and held to his ear . The choir blended as one lush voice , swelling over the worshipers and milling tourists below ? a music beautiful , powerful , and consumingly Slavic . When Todor Zhivkov laments that too many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decadent bourgeois fashion in music , " I suspect that he has in mind not just the discotheques , but also the Bulgarian @# rock groups who attempt to imitate the twang of rock singers from Los Angeles , whose country accent is nearly as bogus . Because of Mr. Zhivkov 's views on decadence ? and the weight his views carry in Bulgaria ? I was pleasantly surprised when , over Radio Sofia , I heard Ella Fitzgerald swinging " In a Mellow Tone . " This eventually led me by a circuitous route to a rehearsal studio in Plovdiv 's Trade Union Hall , where I found Veselin Nikolov , an intense musician whose face glistened with perspiration from blowing a soprano sax . His quintet , the White , Green , and Reds ( the colors of the Bulgarian flag ) , fuses jazz with Bulgarian folk music . The drummer began pinging his cymbal with complicated Rhodope rhythms , then the group ? two fine guitars , a dazzling pianist , and Veselin ? flew off on " Doves , " a composition of Veselin 's they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in New York . In spring all Bulgaria is deliciously green , the meadows flecked with red poppies and yellow wild flowers . Across the northeastern plains , huge fields of wheat and barley stretch beyond the horizon . I headed south into the Pirin toward Gorna Sushitsa , past storks in the meadows . Crows flapped around in the sky in gray vests . AT DAWN while Atanas and I sleep , Vangalia is up and gone from the house . She rides the GAZ to Laskarevo , loads her wicker baskets with tobacco plants , and returns to Gorna Sushitsa . After eating some scrambled eggs , she fastens a field apron around her skirt and pulls on a pair of rubber boots . Atanas is outside cinching up two motikas to the packsaddles . The motika is a heavy hoe , the summer counterpart to the bradva , and in the plum orchards , the vineyards , the fields of tomatoes , no Bulgarian is without one . We head out of the village toward the fields , leading a horse and donkey . At a hayfield Atanas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ditch to a culvert under the road . Water soon reaches their tobacco patch . The shallow ditch will , in time , divide the field , eventually consume it . Much of the Pirin has been eroded in this way , and from overgrazing , leaving abandoned green toupees on high sandy pinnacles. 103  | Vangalia coils her braids on top of her head and wraps them with a white kurpa . We bend at the waist , a pile of plants in one hand , and with our thumbs stuff them in the mud a few inches apart . The mud is grainy , camouflaging sharp rocks , and my thumb is soon without cuticle , without feeling . Most of the villagers are out here on the hillsides punching in tobacco or hoeing , their conversation occasionally punctuated by the kibitzing of nightjars . An Italian mower is cutting the hay , but most of the fields are too steep for anything but a motika and muscle . We plant all day , the sun hot on our backs . Walking home that evening , Vangalia smiles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they spoil in the sun . They have learned a lot , but they can not endure this . " Casually I touch my tender back , distinctly feeling the cracking of eggshell . The leaves will be picked in the fall , dried on poles , then baled in burlap . Bulgaria is the world 's leading exporter of cigarettes , principally to the Soviet Union ? the one product Bulgarians grow and export that is not in short supply in their stores . They smoke so many Shipkas , Stewardesses , and BTs that young men carry lighters on lanyards from their necks . LIKE ALL FARMERS here , the Tunovs grow tobacco on land they formerly owned , but which has since been absorbed into this region 's agro-industrial complex of roughly 60,000 acres . Unlike most complex workers , who earn a flat wage and a possible bonus if the quota is exceeded , each family of Gorna Sushitsa earns 58 percent of the tobacco revenue from the specific parcel it is assigned . " We do better , " Atanas says , " because we do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He remembers experiencing food shortages before the war and how " Bulgarian fascists " stopped them from slipping into Yugoslavia for grain . " No one is poor now if he chooses to work . " Atanas says , " There is much work . " Bulgaria is intensively farmed . In the valleys of the Maritsa and Struma , across the plains , you see tractors and clouds of dust ? and thousands of thunking motikas . The complexes may have overcome inefficiencies of the small private acreages prevailing before the Communist takeover , but the top-heavy bureaucracy has its own inefficiencies which , coupled with harsh winters , a shortage of labor , and the diversion of investment to industry , have crippled production for years . Bulgarians , however , are inexhaustible gardeners ; they harvest a disproportionate share of the country 's produce from the small private plots each family is permitted to work . The shortage of labor is particularly acute during harvest . Along the southern wall of the Balkans , in the Valley of Roses , the Kazanluk rose is grown for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? all delighted to be free of school for a few days , even though it means being out in the fields at 5:30 a. m. , when the roses first open and before the sun evaporates the oil Because the high school closed in the late 1950s , Tsvetanka , Atanas and Vangalia11-year-old daughter , attends school in the valley , where she boards with an aunt . She is home today , for this is the holiday honoring Cyril and Methodius , the two monks who developed the Cyrillic alphabet used by Bulgarians and many other Slays . While Tsvetanka shows Vangalia her report card , Atanas turns and says quietly , " I 've asked her teachers to grade her strictly . If her grades are too high , she may stop studying . " Vangalia tells her to prepare now for the fields . She fusses , wants to visit friends . wants , she adds , new shoes in the style she sees in the valley . It does not seem that Gorna Sushitsa will hold Tsvetanka . The village could not hold Ilia Tunov . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of looking over a plow at the rear of an ox . Ilia had little trouble concluding that life on the Pirin slopes had lost its attraction for him . Ilia is a mechanic at the Kremikovtsi steel plant outside Sofia . He and his wife , Ginka , are fortunate to have a flat in one of the Kremikovtsi apartment buildings near the airport . Housing , particularly in the cities , is in short supply . Until recently Bulgarians could finance and build their own homes , but now they must go through the state construction agencies , which add as much as 100 percent to the cost in surcharges . Mechanics are so desperately needed that Ilia makes  | about $3,000 a year , two-thirds more than the average Bulgarian . An outgoing man with thick wrists , his waist suggests an enjoyment of Ginka 's cooking . They still visit Gorna Sushitsa ( Atanas and Nikola are Ilia 's cousins ) , where they load their car with fresh vegetables and homemade slivova . He is content with Sofia , but says , " The landscape of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summer Ilia and Ginka vacationed at the Black Sea , not in one of the many resort hotels run by Balkantourist , but in a " rest station " that Kremikovtsi 's trade union ? like other unions ? maintains for its workers . Although the waiting lists can be long , the stations cost the equivalent of only about two dollars a night ; a single room in the Swedish-built Hotel Varna at Druzhba resort runs $45 a night , well beyond the reach of all but the party elite . Other Bulgarians often told me of being refused a room at , say , Zlatni Pyasutsi ( Golden Sands ) , or , having secured one , being dispossessed when a bus full of Germans and their deutsche marks arrived . NOT ALL BULGARIANS struggle to make ends meet . In this " classless " society high officials of the Communist Party nest in a very privileged niche . For them the most prestigious and highest paying jobs are available , often a new automobile , a villa in the mountains , no restrictions on where they must live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the freedom to travel abroad . Fighters Against Fascism , the early Communists , are entitled to special housing and an additional $300 a month . Their children and grandchildrenin a country where a university education is cherished and entrance examinations are stiff ? are admitted without examination . Bulgarians cope with their circumscribed life by moonlighting , by a brisk black market ( I 'll give you eighty leva for your Levi 's " ) , and by vruski ? connections . The clerk in the market ( your neighbor ) pulls some veal aside for you ; your cousin with the railroad sees to it that some of those tomatoes destined for Austria end up in your flat . Bulgaria is far more open than it was during the purges following the Communist takeover , but police , the People 's Militia , still have exceptional authority . At a trial in Sofia 's Hall of Justice some teenagers charged with drug offenses stood before the judge for hours while their parents sat on benches twisting their hands , as lost and frightened as parents are in courtrooms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front row . The militiaman , slouching there , waved them back to their seats . During the recess , I asked the judge whether it was common to be overruled by a 109  | policeman . " That 's the way it is here . " Although many books and authors are banned because of political " deviation , " Bulgarians listen to shortwave radios , and their appetite is voracious for anything from the West . The most demonstrative Bulgarians I saw were those shoving and hipping into a bookstore in Plovdiv to buy a newly arrived translation of Jane Eyre ( page 105 ) . Bulgarians who crowd around the United States Embassy , fascinated with the photographs in the display windows of Oscar Peterson at the piano or a Kansas farmer on his tractor , are intimidated and made to move on by the police . Bulgarians who go inside for an American magazine run the risk of being followed and stripped of it . Outward political dissent is as rare as it is dangerous in Bulgaria . " Oh , we can gripe about food shortages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was told many times , " but we do n't dare say anything against the regime . " One who did was the popular Bulgarian writer and defector Georgi Markov , who died in London in 1978 after being struck in the thigh with a poisoned pellet . Markov 's bizarre murder was widely reported in the Western press , but ignored in Bulgarian newspapers . A similar attempt in Paris on Vladimir Kostov , another defector , failed . Both men had been broadcasting programs critical of the Zhivkov regime over Radio Free Europe . A few months before Markov was killed , an investigation revealed , he had  | been warned by a Bulgarian official that he would be poisoned if his broadcasts continued . His assassin has not yet been arrested . For years Bulgaria sealed itself off from the West . Recently , for reasons of its own , it has begun to allow Western writers in . What is Bulgaria ? I ask myself . At times I think that as Bulgarians celebrate the 1,300th anniversary of the first Bulgarian kingdom , they too must wonder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ servile . We are informal and open .
