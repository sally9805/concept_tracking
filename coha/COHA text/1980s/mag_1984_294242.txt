With the economy rebounding , companies are hunting hard for proven talent , and creating a boom for the 1,500 or so firms that are in the business of finding it .

Executive pay packages climbed some 7% last year , well ahead of the 3.8% inflation rate , and they are expected to climb as much as 10% this year .
