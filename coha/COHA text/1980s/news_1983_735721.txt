txt The state of Alaska entered the stock market with $20 million and plans to invest as much as $600 million in coming months from its oil-revenue savings account . Last week 's investment was called a " passive investment " in which the money was spread over 300 stocks , which statistically represent the Standard &; Poor 's Corp . index of 500 stocks . The investment is considered a gamble on the index as opposed to the performance of individual stocks . David Rose . executive director of Alaska Permanent Fund Corp. , a state-owned corporation that administers the oil-revenue savings account , said the permanent-fund board will hire an outside stock-management firm later this month and authorize the managers to invest as much as $150 million in individual stocks . Another $380 million in passive investments will be made by Mr. Rose as market opportunities occur . The permanent-fund board believes the bull market , which began last summer , will be sustained , with adjustments , into early 1985 , according to Mr. Rose " Our intuition tells us that by then a huge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the economy , " he said . The permanent-fund board decided last year to diversify its investments into the stock market and , in the interim , has been working on the mechanics and waiting for an opportune time to invest . Mr. Rose said he was ready to make the investment several weeks ago , but the Dow Jones Industrial Average was at 1240 . A downward correction dropped that figure to 1215 last Thursday when the investment was made . The permanent fund currently has a balance of $4.1 billion , with 90% of that money invested in U.S. government bonds , bills and notes . The remaining money primarily is invested in Alaska housing mortgages and certificates of deposit with Alaska banks . Fund directors do n't anticipate pulling out of existing investments but will use money coming into the fund to invest in the stock market . The fund currently earns about $1.3 million a day on existing investments in addition to $20 million a month from new oil revenue . Mr. Rose said that the fund 's investment philosophy remains " very conservative " and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aimed at producing steady , but not sharp , growth .
