" The doctors could n't get her to stop . Her husband could n't get her to stop . - She was n't going to take orders from anybody . " <P>  --  DONALD COHN , ATTORNEY FOR THE LIGGETT GROUP <P> " Rose Cipollone had the upper lobe of her lung cut out . She still continued to smoke . Does n't that suggest some kind of a dependence ? " <P>  --  MARC EDELL , ATTORNEY FOR THE CIPOLLONES <P> Rose Cipollone was intensely stubborn , especially about her cigarette habit . The New Jersey housewife often ordered groceries she did not need just to get a fresh pack of smokes delivered . She ignored her husband and children when they started urging her to quit in the early 1950s , waving them away when they showed her magazine articles with headlines like CANCER BY THE CARTON . She did make the concession of switching in 1955 from Chesterfield straights to L &M; filters , which were advertised at the time as " just what the doctor ordered . " But Cipollone kept on smoking even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of her right lung in 1981 . She continued sneaking puffs after the entire lung was taken out in 1982 , and finally quit about a year before her death from cancer , at 58 , in 1984 . <P> Yet Cipollone 's name will not be lost among the cancer statistics , because as a final gesture , she turned her stubbornness against the tobacco companies that sold her the cigarettes . She and her husband Tony filed a liability claim , which she made him promise to pursue after her death , though no one had ever won such a case against a cigarette maker . Last week the five-year-old lawsuit made history when a six-member federal jury in Newark ordered the Liggett Group , maker of the Chesterfield and L &M; brands , to pay Tony Cipollone $400,000 in compensatory damages for its contribution to his wife 's death . Of more than 300 lawsuits filed against tobacco companies since 1954 , this case was the first in which the defendant was held at least partly liable or ordered to pay damages . " The myth of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for all , " declared Alan Darnell , an attorney for Cipollone . <P> Anti-tobacco forces celebrated the verdict as a breakthrough . John Banzhaf , a law professor at George Washington University who heads the Action on Smoking and Health group , called the decision the " most important legal development involving tobacco since the cigarette companies were forced off television ( ( in 1971 ) ) . " Product-liability experts predicted that the case would provide a boost in confidence and a how-to manual for the plaintiffs in 110 similar cases now being pursued in the U.S. Before long , the verdict could prompt fresh lawsuits as well , since cigarette foes like Banzhaf estimate that smoking contributes to the premature deaths of some 350,000 Americans each year .
