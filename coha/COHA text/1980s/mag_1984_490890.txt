0 . THE TALK OF THE TOWN Notes and Comment " ALL Europe $1.42 , " said a C phone-company ad we saw a couple of weeks ago . " Additional minutes are only 80c each . " Our phone was a short reach away as we read this ad , and there in the list of available countries were Austria , Denmark , France , Italy , and Sweden , where people live whom we thought instantly of calling up to say , " Hi ! It 's us ! " A dollar forty-two for a minute with Europe struck us as an amazing bargain . And the ad gave a number to call for international information . We called it and got the number of a woman in Copenhagen we have n't seen in ages , wrote it down , sat and studied it , drew some lines and circles and fancy patterns around it , and finally put it away in a desk drawer . We simply could n't think of what to say to Europe . The first minute would go like this : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Who ? WEa Us ! SHE : You 're kidding ! Where are you calling from ? WE : America ! SHE : Really ? WE : Really ! More exclamations , an exchange of " How are you ? " - " Fines , additional surprise , and " What time is it there ? " That minute would be worth $1.42 , no question about it . But we could n't think of what might sustain the additional , eighty-cent minutes . After the initial drama of a call from America , the conversation might very well go dry . " So . What 's new ? " she would say . " Oh , not much . " We 'd feel foolish calling Europe only to say , " Oh , not much . What 's new with you ? " We 've always written letters to those Euro-friends . A particular type of letter : written small , with a fountain pen , on an aerogram made of translucent blue featherweight paper . A very carefully composed letter . In our book , " Dear Georges , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing O.K. " is not how a letter to Europe is supposed to begin . A letter to someone so distant should be a belle lettre , an essay , a little masterpiece , a real keepsake . The idea of calling up Europe and saying , " Hi ! It 's us ! , " as if we were calling St. Paul or San Francisco , strikes us as odd , a violation of the scale of distance , although we 're sure that a great many Americans will do exactly that . Poland is available , and Czechoslovakia , and East Germany , and one can imagine all sorts of benefits coming from inexpensive normal , loose-jointed telephone conversation along the " What 's new ? " line . Our lingering loyalty to the composed lettre on the precious translucent paper has more to do with the instruments involved , we think , than with the message . We like the feel of a good pen when we 're stroking along , thinking hard about our reader across the miles , laying down a particularly graceful " g " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for flight , a plump and cheerful " q . " We enjoy the ceremony with the ink bottle , the memory of early penmanship , the lip-chewing over a sentence that ca n't find its predicate , and , finally , the triumph when we have the whole thing in hand  --  a handsome draft , unsmudged , the lines in smart formation  --  and seal it with our tongue and pound on the stamp , and savor the delicacy of the letter , as light and fragile as what we wrote inside . To us , a telephone is a blunt , cold instrument , and there 's not much more to say about it than that . Three minutes of holding a receiver to our ear , and we ca n't wait to set it down . And yet saying goodbye into a phone is much more complicated than writing " Yours ever " or " Best " or " Hugs &; kisses . " We can imagine that call to Copenhagen drifting on and on while the meter clicks as two people try to sign off : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Same here . Thanks for calling . WE : It was fun talking to you . SHE : I was so surprised to hear your voice ! WE : Well , you sound great . SHE : I 'm amazed at how clear you sound . It 's as if you were calling from next door . WE : Yeah . Well ... STIE : Well , I 'll let you go . This must be costing you a lot of money . We : No , actually the rates are pretty reasonable . A dollar forty-two for the first minute , eighty cents for each additional . SHE : You 're kidding ! That 's wonderful . We : Well , I got to be running along . Pm supposed to be someplace in a little while . SHE : O.K. Well , be sure to write . WE : You bet I will . See you , now . SHE Thanks again for calling . WE : My pleasure . SHE : ' Bye . WE : ' Bye . world looks like to a dog , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the Mushers ' Ball , which was a party marking last month 's Alpo International Sled Dog Championships at Saranac Lake , in the Adirondacks . " Dogs are very telepathic . You 've got to be so careful about playing favorites . You 've got to make all of them on the team feel they 're important , and then they 'll feel the same way about you , " said Harris Dunlap , a dog breeder who can " lengthen critical bones like the tibia " in just a few generations ; a racing champion ; and a swami of the sport , who spent most of the Mushers ' Ball talking to correspondents from magazines like Gun Dog . " We had a friend who had a dog who rode a surfboard , " Violet Salrone , of Syosset , Long Island , said while her husband , Robert , was at the Musher bar fetching drinks . " The dog never got her feet wet . They 'd tow her out , and she 'd ride the waves in . And the rest of the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their child on the beach and make sure he did n't go in the water . We got into sled-dog racing because we like ani mals , I guess , and cold weather . During the summer , to keep the dogs in shape , we hitch them to a stripped-down Japanese car  --  it has no engine  --  and they pull that around in the cool of the evening . " At that point , her husband returned , and told us he was a high-school biology teacher . " I 'm close to my dogs and I 'm close to my students , " he said . Sled-dog racing has yet to gain the national recognition of some other sports  --  squash , for instance  --  but not because its enthusiasts are insufficiently enthusiastic . Many of the mushers at Saranac Lake had driven across the continent from Alaska or British Columbia , or had come from Minnesota and other unheated places not quite so far away . As for the dogs , they lunged at their traces as they waited in the starting chute , insanely eager to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as far as sixteen miles . " You 'll notice that a number of these dogs are ugly as sin  --  they 've been bred for speed , and they often have some hound in them , among other things , " Kathy Ivitney , one of the race organizers , told us as we FEBRUARY 20 , 1984 watched racers in the six-dog category finish their heat , the dogs still running hard . " Appearancewise , we may not be talking ( Nanook of the North , ' but these dogs can run as fast as twenty-five miles an hour in spurts . " The races began and ended in the parking lot of Charlie 's Inn , which is the sort of bar that has a lot of plaques on the wall with funny sayings on them ( " I 've drunk so often to your health that I 've ruined my own " ) . Inside its doors , Genesee Cream Ale flowed as fast and foamy as the nearby Ausable River in the spring ( this time of year , it just sits there ) ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and confusion . The dogs arrived in trucks divided into small , straw-lined compartments . Many of the pickups bore the insignia of corporate sponsors : " Tuffy 's Pet Foods , " " Jappy  --  Nourriture pour Chiens , " " SIIUR-GAIN . " In one corner of the lot , the weight-pull event drew spectators while the racers were out on the course ; our favorite dog , Timber , sat resolutely on the ice , ignoring his handler 's pleas that he tug a sled loaded with four hundred and thirty-three pounds of chicken-flavored Alpo from one blue line to another . Nearby , Ed Blechner , who lives in Vermont , gave demonstrations of his " working " sled dogs , slow but strong Samoyeds and malamutes , who , he assured us , " are better suited to pulling heavy weights than horses or tractors are  --  they can pull up to twenty-five times their body weight . " He also explained the derivation of the word " mush " ? a corruption , he said , of the French " Mai-chez. , " " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things like ' Go for it ! ' or rely on intonation , " Blechner said . " Anyway , dogs do n't tend to understand words the way we do . When I say Nuki , good dog , ' he hears Thhh-uh , uhhuhhh , ' or something like that . But he sort of understands . " Nearby , a concessionaire was offering sled-dog rides . We careered down a practice trail behind a hundred-pound Siberian named Mukluk , who , all by himself , managed to give us some feel for the power of a team of dogs . " Gee ! " we said , and he turned right . " Haw ! " we said , and he turned left . Mukluk 's only liability was a Muirlike love for his surroundings  --  particularly the scent of certain trees , bushes , and rocks , of which there proved to be many in the woods . But when he licked our palm we forgave him for all the detours . On the final day of racing , we hiked THE NEW YORKER. far out into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and stood by the side of the course waiting for the sleds to dash by . About half a mile away , at a clearing , we could see the leading team pulling hard , and then we could hear the dogs yelping , and then they were right in front of us , all grace and strength and coordination and happy fury , and then they were by , and there was only the back of the musher disappearing into the woods , and it was quiet again , save for the whine of a distant snowmobile . Gizmos in Las Vegas THE future can get mighty shifty in the fast-paced field of high tech , but there 's no better place to look for it than Las Vegas , at the International Winter Consumer Electronics Show , which claims to be " the biggest annual trade show in the world " and wo n't get any argument from us . This year 's show filled the entire Las Vegas Convention Center and large sections of the nearby Riviera , Sahara , and Hilton hotels besides . More than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were assured , were " the general public . " It was easy , we can testify , to spend three days at the show and not see everything there was to see . But we managed to take in a robot named Hubot , with a " molded one-piece Hubody ... made to last a lifetime " ( just whose lifetime was left unclear ) ; a Freudian video game called The Institute , in which the player-patient travels from dream to dream , searching for the key to his disorders , and ( as one of the designers told us ) " you see your psychiatrist with a gun to his head and you tell him to shoot himself , and he does ; " a foam-headed hammer called the Bit Banger , for those suffering from computer frustration ; and a handy exercise-bike accessory that lets you play video games as you pedal in place . " You get your exercise almost by osmosis , " said George Coakley , the exuberant president of the company that makes this item , and he added , " As a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pet rock . That was my first lesson in mass hysteria . I never would have believed that people would tear each other apart to get to a product . " Outside , in the wider world of Las Vegas , the moon might have been lust another neon sign , and a pale one at that , next to signs extolling the charms of Robert Goulet , Wayne Newton , the " Bal du Moulin Rouge starring Suzanne Somers , " and " All New Direct from Paris  --  Les Bluebell Girls with a Cast of 100 Starring Bobby Berosini 's Orangutans . " But what need had we for such stars when right there on the Convention Center floor we could admire the talents of Art Linkletter , promoting a computerized spinoff of his best-selling book " Kids Say the Darndest Things , " retitled " Kids Say the Daintiest Things . . . to Computers ; " Minnesota Fats , Leonard Nimoy , and the Nevada state muscular-dystrophy poster child , all somehow affiliated with a video billiards game ; and Debbie Reynolds , with " Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ co-featuring Teri Garr , Florence Henderson , Dionne Warwick , Rose Marie , and Virginia Mayo . " I could n't do the tapes that I bought , " Miss Reynolds explained when she was asked about the origins of her program . " And I figured if they were too hard for me there might be a lot of ladies like me . " Other home-video companies were peddling other new entries in the star-powered exercise market , including the country singer Irlene Mandrell with " Irlene Mandrell 's Texersize ' " and the TV personality Jayne Kennedy with " Love Your Body . " And we saw a preview of a video course in the Lamaze method of natural childbirth , with Patty Duke Astin top-lined . But at a panel discussion of the video-software business Stuart Karl , of Karl Video , which is the co-producer of the pioneering tape " Jane Fonda 's Workout , " seemed less than flattered by all the imitation . He warned that consumers would not stand for the use of celebrities merely " as a hook " for programs to which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a recurring theme of the show . One of the keynote speakers , Don Kingsborough , who is a senior vice-president of Atari , exhorted his colleagues to put more emphasis on quality and less on low prices . " Who are we helping if a consumer buys a cheap computer and uses it as an electronic doorstop ? " he asked . " The price wars , my friends , must end for everyone 's sake . " Warner Communications ' Atari subsidiary , incidentally , had one of the spiffiest and most spacious pavilions , perhaps to deflect attention from the more than five hundred million dollars in losses that the company sustained last year . Video games , Mr. Kingsborough acknowledged , were no longer " a galactic joyride for everyone , " but he predicted that if the industry made the proper adjustments  --  forsaking " the stick figures of yesterday " for sharper graphics , voice control , and synthesized speech , while finding a way to appeal to senior citizens , " a very large growth market " ? balmy days might yet lie ahead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Wow , I did n't know a computer could do that ! ' and , most important , ' I want one ! ' " he concluded . In the world of videocassette recorders , there was a feeling that it might be time to let well enough alone . The big news was Kodak 's new camera-recorder combo , with a scaled-down cassette . Kodak 's competitors made no effort to conceal their fear that consumers might begin to think of the conventional half-inch machines as obsolescent . Bob O'Neil , the executive vice-president of Hitachi , questioned the wisdom of " spotlighting a new product before its time " and announced that his company , for one , had no intention of switching video formats . " At an explosive growth-rate position in the industry 's life cycle , " he explained , " management should take responsible and prudent action not to interfere with the high sales rate currently being enjoyed . " Stephen Stepnes , an RCA Consumer Electronics division vice-president , sought to console his colleagues with the news that Kodak 's new system had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a football game . The product , he said , would have " some appeal to the upscale videophile . " At countless receptions , dinners , and hospitality suites where exhibitors and retailers congregated off the show floor , there was much talk about the troubles of Atari , Apple , Coleco , and Commodore ; about a Japanese effort to adopt a standard programming language for home computers ; about the quality of sound offered by the new compact audio disc ; about the spectacular sales figures for telephones and related devices ; and about the coming of stereo TV , which Jeff Berkowitz , of Sanyo , called " one of the real hot buttons in terms of consumer purchasing . " Mr. Berkowitz warmed the hearts of many retailers by forecasting that stereo TV would be " a middle- to high-end market , " offering " an excellent profit opportunity for all of you . " The second sound channel could be used for foreign languages , he pointed out . And William E. Boss , who is also with RCA Consumer Electronics , raised the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they will bequeath older sets to their children for use as computer and video-game screens . The consumer-electronics business enjoyed such an extraordinary year in 1983 , Mr. Boss said , that " any manufacturer , distributor , or retailer who failed to make record profits " ought to look into the mirror with a probing eye . The reverses suffered by a few computer companies , he said , were only part of a weeding-out process that had yielded a " cleaner market . " We , too , everywhere we went , had the feeling of being in a privileged community of Americans ( and Japanese , Taiwanese , Koreans , and Britons ) , floating far above the mire that is the rest of the world economy , at an altitude where the old notions of progress and growth remain miraculously intact , and such conflicts as there are have the Savor of a Punch-and-Judy show , with the purveyor of the latest gizmo forever bopping the next-to-latest on the bean . Shakespeare in Concord THE key February Democratic primary in New Hampshire was n't even mentioned in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during a two-hour meeting of a hundred and thirty-three citizens at the Havenwood retirement community , where Richard Lederer , FEBRUARY 20 , 1984 columnist extraorelinaire ( " Looking at Language " in the Concord Monitor , among other newspapers ) and teacher infatigable ( chairman of the English Department of St. Paul 's School , a few miles away ) , was giving a seminar contprehensif on " A Brief History of the English Language Up to Shakespeare and . Insights Into the Bard 's Personal Contributions to Our Vocabulary with Special Attention to Sonnets XII and LXXIII . " In the Concord Monitor that morning , a reporter named Richard Mertens had told about the " wild cheering for the most unusual and elusive of the Democratic Presidential candidates  --  Jesse Jackson , " who had spoken at a Concord hotel the night before for almost as long as Mr. Lederer 's seminar was to last , and had demanded justice for the poor , for women , for students , for the elderly , and for the unemployed , saying , " You can not believe Ronald Reagan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not invincible . " And that morning , at the new , modern Eagle Square marketplace , a sculptor , Emile Birch , had completed a Mt . Rushmore-type likeness in ice of Gary Hart , among likenesses , previously completed , of John Glenn , Walter Mondale , Jesse Jackson , and Ronald Reagan . The weather was unseasonably warm , and the sculptures were dripping , but they were still recognizable . The next morning , in a wooded area , with white birch trees and opaquely iced miniature Niagaras over rocks , where the Society for the Protection of New Hampshire Forests has its headquarters in a solar-oriented modern building of local pine and birch , Environmentalists for Mondale would meet . The society is the largest conservation group in New Hampshire ( more than five thousand members ) and among the strongest in the country . Reports would be typed : " President Reagan in his State of the Union Message on January 25 , 1984 , proposed research only on acid rain , and no control of the sulfur emissions that are the primary cause of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of office , Mr. Reagan has demonstrated a fundamental lack of leadership in the acid-rain issue by failing to confront and seek a solution to this serious environmental , public-health , and economic problem . " And Walter Mondale would tell the New Hampshire Environmentalists , " Dirty air , dirty water , acid rain , and toxic waste are good business for the few , and the laws of the land are meant to protect THE NEW YORkER all of us . . .. We need to restore professionalism in our government . . . . I would restore certain funds . .. . As President , you take an oath to take care of the laws of the land . . . . They 've trashed the laws . . . . Some of these people , these toxic-waste perpetrators , ought to go to jail . These people ought to go to the slammer for a long time to think it over . " At Havenwood , the atmosphere was calmer but the pace was faster . Mr. Lederer , a burly , woodsy-looking man who stands six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rust-colored chamois shirt over a brown turtleneck . He was equipped with a record-player and a filmstrip projector . His audience was mostly well beyond middle age and was very respectably dressed , the men in suits , shirts , and bow ties , the ladies in print dresses , cardigan sweaters , and orthopedic black shoes . Mr. Lederer grinned at them with approval . " We have much gray eminence here tonight , " he said , and then he nodded , drew a deep breath , and put on a record of the original , 1948 Broadway production of the Cole Porter musical " Kiss Me , Kate " : Brush up your Shakespeare , Start quoting him now ! Brush up your Shakespeare , And the women you will wow . The audience barely stirred . Everybody looked solemn . If your blonde wo n't respond when you flatter ' er , Tell her what Tony told Cleopatterer . " Well ! " Mr. Lederer said cheerfully when the song was finished . " What a guy , that Shakespeare ! " The ladies and gentlemen in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Some took out pencils and paper . " We are going to start with a thirty-five-minute history of our language , " Mr. Lederer said briskly . He fixed his attention successively on individual members of the audience , winning response and attention . " Only Chinese is spoken as a native tongue by more people in the world than English is , and that 's only because there are so many Chinese , " Mr. Lederer said . " English is spoken by all religions and all classes all over the world . You and I share a tongue that is the closest thing to a world language . " The notetakers had n't yet taken a note . " Sixty per cent of the world 's phone calls " ? Mr. Lederer raised his voice slightly ? " are made in English . " Pencils moved . Over the next few minutes , with the aid of a filmstrip depicting our forebears in drawings somewhat in the style of " The Flintstones , " Mr. Lederer clearly made speed a priority . With the lights dimmed , some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon resisted the slouch in favor of alertness to the Angles , the Jutes , the Saxons ; the West Saxon dialect , the Old English dialect ; King Alfred ; the German , Scandinavian , and small Latin element in Old English ; Beowulf ; the change from the Anglo-Saxon influence in 449 A.D. to the Norman influence in 1066 ; the reason for the multiplicity in English of words with the same meaning ; the significance of Chaucer 's writing ; the significance of 1362 , when English became England 's official language ; the significance of William Caxton 's printing press in 1476 ; the significance of French words in English ( " chivalry , " " tournament , " " banquet " ) ; the significance of Latin words in English ( " legal , " " regal , " " social " ) ; the direct importation of Greek and Latin words during the Renaissance ; and the emergence of early modern English by 1600 . Lights on . Nobody was asleep . Mr. Lederer looked pleased at the way things were steaming along . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
