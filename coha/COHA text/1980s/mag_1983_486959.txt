President Reagan 's suggestion that the United Nations quit Turtle Bay for Lenin Hills or some other more congenial setting can hardly be called the cornerstone of the Administration 's foreign policy . But neither is it entirely irrelevant to it . New York was chosen as the site for the United Nations at the insistence of Trygve Lie , the first Secretary General , who hoped the physical presence of the institution on American soil would weigh against the kind of isolationist sentiment here that helped destroy the League of Nations , But internationalism is more of a problem with U.S. foreign policy in this half of the century than isolationism , which sometimes seems splendid by comparison . The U.N . ' s integration into American geography tends to encourage Presidents to use the world body as an extension of domestic politics , by other means . That 's true for obscure or upstart pols as well . Jeane Kirkpatrick and George Bush are U.N . babies . Daniel Patrick Moynihan built his senatorial career on a series of jeremiads he spouted at U.N . sessions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; last week he gleefully called it " a cesspool . " The weak and fragile structure of the United Nikns is hardly enhanced by its function in the erican political system , so why not move it to a distant site , far from the omnipresent glare of media lights , the hot breath of imperial interests , the temptations of the glamorous life in Fun City ? Moscow would be inappropriate , not only because there are no truly great discos or three-star restaurants there but also because Soviet politicians ca n't be trusted to treat the United Nations any better than American ones . Europe is pleasant but pass ? . That leaves the Third World : surely there 's a place that 's warm ig the winter and cool in the summer , with unlimited parking for limousines with DPL plates . SUPPLY- SIDE IMMIGRATION REFORM GEOFFREY RIPS On June 20 , speaking at a Republican Party dinner in Jackson , Mississippi , President Reagan warned that failure to increase U.S. military and economic aid to Central America would result in " a tidal wave of refugees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' and not ' boat people , ' swarming into our country seeking a safe haven from communist repression to our south . " Reagan was right in saying that there is a correlation between patterns of immigration and our economic and political policies at home and abroad . Unfortunately , the correlation he made was the wrong one . Every thirty years or so the United States undergoes a xenophobic convulsion in the name of " immigration reform . " The SimPsonMazzoli Immigration Reform and Control Act , now before the House , is a product of the latest such spasm . Popular support for such " re . form " is characteristically fanned by the sort of jingoism President Reagan resorted to in his Mississippi speech . In 1954 , when hundreds of thousands of illegal Mexican workers were deported , the acting commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service appealed to the gods of the cold war in testimony before Congress , saying that 100 " Communists and ex-Reds " were crossing the border daily . Today we are given dire warnings of hordes of " feet people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The swelling population of Mexico , driving millions of illegal aliens over the border , " former Director of Central intelligence William Colby said , " is a greater threat to the future of the United States than the Soviet Union .

The Right Stuff not only celebrates the high-tech heroism of candidate John Glenn ; it also sets the style and substance of politics in the year to come ( if real life follows the script ) : nostalgic , mythic , docudramatic and devoid of any issue or idea that could enliven the electoral discourse . It 's too bad for us all that only the movie lasts three hours and ten minutes . Glenn 's luck , or timing , is phenomenal . The Right Stuff . is the ultimate commercial tie-in , the perfect ancillary and subsidiary package .

Ideologically , Glenn should be Ronald Reagan 's favorite Democrat . He has voted with the President on the budget , on nerve gas and on the B-1 ; he supported draft registration , the neutron bomb and arms sales to Chile bFfore the President did . He 's soft on acid rain , leery of labor and properly distant from women and minorities . Politically , however , Reagan must fear that Glenn would be the strongest Democratic opponent , that he cuts so far into the Republicans ' center and right-wing constituencies that he poses the greatest threat to the G.O.P. 's " new majority . " If all this sounds like the stuff of a political movie , it 's no coincidence . The media have stopped asking and writing about the meat of politics : power , conflict , insurgency and reform . Instead , we get an overdose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ campaign chests , endorsements , defections , color and kitsch . Production schedules being what they are , the other candidates have no time to crank out their own movies to compete with Glenn 's . If they were smart , however , they would claim previously released films for their own . Walter Mon-dale , for instance , might announce that the current film I Married a Shadow is the true-life story of his wife , Joan . Gary Hart , who seems to be talking only to himself these days , could buy into the TV series Hart to Hart . Is Moon Over Miami the Reuben Askew story ? And jogger Alan Cranston has the perfect vehicle : The Loneliness o Tithe Long Distance Runner . The War at Home T he war in Central America came home in a small but startling way recently when two priests and an Army Reserve warrant officer made a series of bold forays into the U.S. Army base at Fort Ben-ning , Georgia . Their mission was to persuade Salvadoran Army officer corps candidates to desert their government 's military machine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maryknoll priest , Father Larry Rosebaught , an Oblate priest , and Linda Ventimiglia , the Reserve officer , donned military uniforms , slipped into the base and penetrated the area where the Salvadoran troops were barracked . They walked from building to building for twenty-five minutes , distributing leaflets and urging the soldiers to desert . They were arrested and released . The following morning they again assumed their disguises and returned in time for Sunday services at the base chapel , where they distributed leaflets to U.S. Army personnel . Again they were arrested ; they were charged with criminal trespass and escorted off the post . A week later , the brazen threesome put on their uniforms and slipped through tightened security into the base . This time they were armed with a tape player and mountaineering equipment . Using crampons and a rope ladder , Father Bourgeois scaled a towering pine tree near a training field only forty yards from the main guard station . The others followed him up , the ladder was lifted and the " blaster " was lowered . Suddenly the booming voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The words werethose he spoke in his final sermon , just before he was assassinated in San Salvador on March 24 , 1980 : I want to make a special appeal to the soldiers . . . .

M.P.s scrambled about the field , but the trio remaiE. - 'd concealed for half an hour . Father Bourgeois followed the Archbishop 's appeal with a taped call for the soldiers to apply for political asylum . Only after the M.P.s spied the three demonstrators and threatened to shoot did they come down . More charges were lodged , and the F.B.I . began an investigation .

Later , F.B.I . agents and local police officers arrested the three leaders at Father Bourgeois 's home . They were tried last month : Father Bourgeois received an eighteen-month sentence ; the other two got fifteen months . A few days after the trial , the 487 combat-ready Salvadorans returned , on schedule , to their country . Apartheid Inc. wo years have passed since the Reagan Administration announced its policy of " constructive engagement " with South Africa and removed the Carter Administration 's restrictions on trade with the apartheid regime . ( Those restrictions prohibited the export of certain high-tech , industrial and military-related products and attempted to discourage investment in new plants in South Africa . ) At the time , President Reagan argued that his policy would be more effective in ending apartheid than one of isolating South Africa by trade embargoes . The South Africans , he said , would be exposed to enlightened American corporate practices , and the economic lot of many black workers would be improved by higher American wages . Two years of constructive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recent surveys by th , e International Labor Organization and various U.N . agencies , constructive engagement has given U.S. corporations a green light for investment in South Africa , with absolutely no moral or social constraints . . There are conflicting figures on the amount of U.S. investment in South Africa , depending on what methods of accounting are used . For example , until this summer the State Department calculated U.S. investment at $2.5 billion . The Nonaligned Nations put the figure at $6 billion . An August State Department cable , however , put the amount at $14.5 billion . Nevertheless , U.N . documents indicate that U.S. investments in South Africa may have grown by as much as $8 billion over the past three years . More than 1,000 corporations now profit from their collaboration with the racist reginie . ( The exact amount of foreign investment in South Africa can not be calculated because the government will not disclose information about certain sectors of the economy , for security reasons . ) In 1982 , the United States replaced Britain as South Africa 's primary trading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ list of the top fifty foreign investors itOtbuth Africa compiled by the U.N . Special Committee Against Apartheid names eighteen American corporate giants . These companies dominate South Africa 's automotive , energy and high-technology sectors , and make significant contributions to its military strength . Who are they ? They include Burroughs , Control Data , I.B.M. , N.C.R . and the Sperry Corporation , which virtually control South Africa 's computer industry ( I.B.M . South , Africa has a 40 percent share of the market ) . Also listed are American Motors , Chrysler , Ford and General Motors , which have South African sales offices ; Chrysler , Ford and G.M. have also opened manufacturing plants , which turn out one-third of all the cars and trucks sold in South Africa . Caltex and Mobil are the country 's leading suppliers of petroleum products . American banks play a prominent role in South African finance . In the past several years , twenty-six American banks have lent more than $1 billion to public ( i.e. , government agencies or companies ) and private borrowers . Citicorp participated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and its South African subsidiary is the twenty-third largest bank in the country . American companies such as AMAX , Fluor , Hanna Mining , Phelps Dodge and the Zapata Corporation , which have been involved in mining operations in Namibia , continue to show interest in that country 's natural resources . Those resources are protected by U.N . Resolution 2145 , passed in 1966 , which terminated South Africa 's mandate in Namibia , and Resolution 3295 , passed in 1974 , which prohibits the taking of resources " without the consent and permission of the U.N . Council for Namibia . " Ten percent of the West 's uranium is mined in Namibia , and American companies like Conoco , Getty , Mobil , Standard Oil of California and Texaco suspect there may be vast reserves of oil in the Etosha Pan region . Currently , Western firms , which obtain their licenses from the illegal South African administration in Namibia , take out 36 percent of the country 's ewes domestic product in the form of profits , dividends and fps ; that money then flows to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ significantly improved the living standards of black workers relative to whites . The average monthly wage of blacks is one-fourth of that earned by whites  --  as it was in 1971 . In some sectors of the economy , the income gap between whites and blacks has actually widened . The Sullivan Code , drawn up by the Rev. Leon Sullivan of Philadelphia in 1977 , calls on U.S. companies with plants in South Africa to integrate work facilities , provide equal pay for equal work and train blacks for supervisory and technical jobs . But this voluntary code is adhered to by less than half of the American firms there . The code does not at-tempt to deal with the key issue of equal opportunity for blacks . According to a 1983 International Labor Organization study , blacks , who make up 80 percent of South Africa 's work force , hold less than 1 percent of all managerial and administrative positions and less than 25 percent of all prossional and technical jobs . There is rarely even a semblance of dialogue between management and the black labor force . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ workers at their plants . Caltex , Coca-Cola , Firestone , I.B.M. , Goodyear , Johnson &; Johnson , Kimberly Clark , Mobil , 3M , Newmont Mining , Otis Elevator and Union Carbide are among the American firms with a high proportion of black employees that neither recognize nor negotiate with any of the black trade unions . Many American companies investing in South Africa under the constructive engagement policy are involved in projects that will increase the country 's economic and military power , thus strengthening the apartheid system . For example , Control Data and the Fluor Corporation have been instrumental in building the sophisticated SASOL II and III oil-from-coal projects . These $7.5 billion facilities clearly have strategic and military importance : they will insure that South Africa , which has no indigenous oil reserves , would not be crippled economically by an oil embargo . American companies also sell South Africa enriched uranium ( SWUCO , Foxboro , Edlow International ) and reactor technology ( Babcock &; Wilcox , Bechtel , Westinghouse ) .

Of these , H.R. 1693 , introduced by Representative Stephen Solarz earlier this year , has attracted the most support and has eighty-one co-sponsors . It would ban the import of South African krugerrands and other gold coins , ban U.S. bank loans to the South African public sector and make acl herence to the Sullivan Code mandatory . H.R. 1877 , introduced by Representative Howard L. Berman , would revive the export controls imposed by the Carter Administration and halt all exports that would sustain the South African military machine . The third bill , Representative William H. Gray 3d 's Prohibition on Investment in South Africa Act , would ban new investment there . These three bills , which would curtail U.S. corporate sup- , port of the racist regime in Pretoria , have little chance of passage , and even less of being signed by President Reagan . In its opposition to restrictions on trade with South Africa , the Administration conveniently forgets the arguments it advances when it wants to apply economic sanctions against the Soviet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States opposes . But Pretoria 's fanatical anticommunism makes it a cold-war ally worth its weight in krugerrands . JOSH MARTIN Josh Martin is U.N . correspondent for Multinational Monitor . Anybody who spends any time observing this Congress is forced , periodically , to ask the same question . It 's a recurrent question because it concerns Democratic funk . Whether one is a supporter or an opponent of the President , one is compelled to marvel at the utter want of spine to be found among the loyal opposition on the Hill . On the budget ( or on the reductions in same ) , on the MX missile , on chemical warfare , the Democratic leadership , like clowns in some low circus , seem to wait nervously for their cue to fall down and roll in the sand . When the cue comes , they appear to feel an overpowering sense of relief  --  as if the sheer maintenance of upright posture had been a strain . The charade over the War Powers Act , with Democrats imploring the President for a chance to endorse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the law if he mends it in time , is one example . The Boland amendment , which prohibits the levying of war on the Nicaraguan government for the purpose of its overthrow , is another . Last month Managua was bombed from the air  --  no doubt in order to induce a change of heart in the Sandinist leadership  --  and nobody in Washington seemed to give a damn . Indeed , days later , on September 22 , the Senate Intelligence Committee voted 13 to 2 to provide $19 million in fiscal 1984 for operations against Nicaragua . Almost every Democrat was among the thirteen . Allegedly , George Shultz and William Casey had convinced the doubters with a " new " justification . No longer was the Administration destabilizing Nicaragua because of its aid to the rebels in El Salvador , they said . Now the aim is to discourage the advocacy of " revolution without frontiers " in the region . To those being bombed in Managua , that might seem to be a distinction without a difference ; if there is a difference , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this dismal scene of Democrats rushing to share not only the conclusions but the assumptions of the President , there is one striking exception . Representative Wyche Fowler of Georgia has been arguing against the Central Intelligence Agency 's war on Nicaragua from its inception . Now , in hearings before the House Intelligence Subcommittee , which he chairs , he has been testing his own legislative proposals to limit covert action . The proposals are embodied in three bills , and if enacted ( which will occur on the same day that pigs take wings ) , they would insure prior Congressional approval of military or paramilitary undertakings by the C.I.A . and , what is more important , Congressional control over the funding of such actions . This might prevent the C.I.A . ' s abuse of its " contingency reserve fund , " and the discovery , so often made in the past , that a minor operation had " just growed . " It would also save legislators from moral blackmail . As things stand , they can try to stop a " secret " war only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accused of stabbing field operatives in the back and of other unlovely and un-American things . The testimony before the committee makes absorbing reading . Fowler went miles out of his way in order to stressthat his legislation would actually strengthen American capabilities . But those who testified in its favor made no secret of their conviction that increased Congressional oversight would or should inhibit , if not prevent , such actions as the murders of Allende and Lumumba and the deliberate deception of Congress and the media by an agency with no ri , ; ' of domestic intervention . At present , said Fowler , there are at least two covert operations that threaten to get out of control He was too tactful to speedy what the ale , but it seems pretty certain that one of them is in Chad , where the C.l A helped in the overthrow of former President Goukouni Oueddei ( while , of course , only meaning to " send him a signal " ) . The budget for that operation is said to have been as high as $22 million . Other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad money after bad , Chile When things go wrong , as they infallibly will , Congress will be hard put to raise a stink , because it has , after all , been " notified , " and thus can hardly tell the C.I.A . " we told you so . " That this state of affairs is intended and not ironic was made very clear by the witnesses for the Reagan Administration . William Casey and a senior State Department official , both scheduled to testify , canceled at the last minute . Instead they relied on surrogates . Of these , the most interesting and revealing was Ray Cline . Cline , a former C.I.A . eminence and intelligence adviser to the Reagan team , is now a Taiwan lobbyist and an ornament of the Center for Strategic and International Studies at Georgetown University . His book Secrets , Spies and Scholars contains the following wonderful piece of reasoning : " It was not illogical " for the C.I.A . to use the Mafia in an attempt to murder Fidel Castro , since the mob 's " former @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and since a gangland killing would be unlikely to be attributed to the U.S. government . " A man as naive as that makes the perfect witness for Reaganite realism . As he told Fowler 's subcommittee , " responsible leaders in Congress ought to be aware of such programs , but to succeed they must be covert and not disclosed to the general public . " In other words , Congres is made co-responsible but is not actually consulted . It would be better , in such cases , not to be told at all . Fowler 's legislation contains some 1dealit formulations  --  he proposes an untestable definition of " essential " to determine if U S interests warrant covert intervention , and he asks that such actions be taken only on behalf of policies already defined for , and supported by , the American people . An unscrupulous President could interpret either restraint pretty broadly , and an invertebrate Congress could permit him to do so . But even that would be preferable to the present situation , where Congress is told things it does n't want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Power without responsibility , " said British Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin , " is the prerogative of the harlot throughout the ages . " Responsibility without power is something more than mere prostitution Why , I have been asked , does The Nation choose to publish only every other week in July and August even though the oppression of the downtrodden goes on erg day of the year ? The question was rated this summer in a rather strongly worded letter that a reader named Sheldon A. Schryer apparently meant for the entire Nation staff but sent to me  --  perhaps because he remembered my name from the time a year or so ago when he chastised me for allowing the torment of the Scottsboro Boys to slip from my memory . " Enemies of the people ! " Schryer began . " Lackeys of the Bosses ! Pisherkehs ! Or have I missed something ? Could it be that the unionbusting racists who run Southern textile mills treat their workers with respect and brotherhood on alternate weeks in July ? Are the political prisoners who rot in the jails @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months to alternate a week of freedom with every week in the torture chambers ? Or , to put it another way , is it possible for editors and writers to fight oppression one week and spend the next week in beach houses sipping gin and tonics ( made with limes picked by nonunion braceros ) ? Is it possible that political commitment can be turned off and on , like **28;2768;TOOLONG parking regulations ? " I thought Schryer had raised some interesting questions about Nation policy , but I was not , of course , the person to answer them . At The Nation , I am simply a part-time columnist  --  doing what the people who attempt to organize those Southern textile mills would refer to as " piecework . " I do n't want to appear to be distancing myself from an institution while it 's under intense criticism , but I might point out that I do n't , even have an office at The Nation  --  any more than the bent but seemingly indefatigable immigrants who did piecework in their Lower East Side tenements maintained offices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's letter , in fact , reached me in Nova Scotia , where my family and I have spent our summers ever since I discovered that Canada is a country in which the New Hampshire oimary is almost never mentioned . Confident that The Nation 's editor , one Victor S. Navasky , could provide some persuasive answers to Schryer 's questions , I telephoned the Nation office in New York . The telephone rang for a very long time . Finally , it was answered by a Nation employee I 'll call Emile Zola . " What 's the latest on government surveillance , oil-/ company profiteering and the oppression of the poor , Zola ? " I said , to make conversation . " I do n't get much news up here . " " I do n't know , " Zola said . " We do n't publish this week . I 'm only in here because it's-air-conditioned . " I asked to speak to Victor S. Navasky . " It 's about policy , " I added . " He is n't here , " Zola said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I guess he 's exposing dreadful working conditions in the Yorkshire textile industry , " I said . " I do n't think so , " Zola said . " He got a grant to go over there and talk to his friends , although I do n't think it was worded quite like that . He did n't say anything about going to Yorkshire , and he asked me about a couple of restaurants in Hampstead . " I figured the publisher would be in a position to discuss policy , so I asked for Hamilton Fish 3rd . Do n't ask me why a left-wing magazine has a publisher with two last names and a number . I do n't even have an office there . " He is n't here either , " Zola said . " He 's been gone most of the summer  --  to Third World countries . " " Which Third World country is he in ? " " Mexico , " Zola said . " You mean going to Acapulco is visiting a Third World country ? " I asked , noticing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interrogatory style . " I do n't know if Acapulco is where he is , " Zola said . " He did n't leive an address . " Was it possible that Hamilton Fish 3rd was drinking margaritas in Zihuatanejo or Cuernavaca and calling it a visit to the Third World ? Could it be that he was a traitor to this class , too ? Was he some sort of double agent ? Not having any idea how to reach Hamilton Fish 3rd , I decided to wait for Navasky 's return from England . I phoned around the middle of August , and , after a number of rings , Zola answered again . " You missed him , " Zola said , before I could ask if South America was still rife with dictators and the arms race continued to threaten mankind . " He was here for a day or two , but now he 's on Martha 's Vineyard . " Martha 's Vineyard ! I figured that Navasky was back at work .

" I suppose he 's up there exposing the hypocrisy of the Landed Left , " I said to Zola . " Not unless he 's trying to embarrass them by showing up at all their cocktail parties , " Zola said . Well , that left no question about what I should write to Schryer . " Apologist ! " I began . " Protector of Backsliders ! Moderate !
