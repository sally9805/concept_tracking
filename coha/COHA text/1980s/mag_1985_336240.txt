When the U.S. Supreme Court handed down a pair of eagerly awaited rulings last week , the results  --  two 4-4 deadlocks  --  were disappointing for all concerned . In one , the village of Scarsdale , N.Y. , was appealing a lower federal court ruling that invalidated the town 's ban on the display of a creche in a public park . In the other case , a federal court had thrown out an Oklahoma law that authorized the dismissal of public school teachers who advocate homosexual activity . The tie votes mean that the lower-court rulings stand , but the high bench 's action has no value as a precedent . The difference between a decision and no decision in both cases was the absence of Justice Lewis Powell , who has just returned to the bench after missing five weeks of oral arguments while undergoing treatment of prostate cancer . Three other tie votes were also announced last week , and three additional cases were not decided when the high court took the unprecedented step of ordering new oral arguments in the same term on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> Why some cases were to be reargued while others were not remains a mystery , but one result was clear : much court work was done to little purpose . And there may be more such outcomes ; Powell has missed oral arguments in 56 cases . His health and the eight non-results last week highlight anew the court 's age . In the event of a vacancy , the Reagan Administration is ready with an updated list of prospective Justices . White House Counsel Fred Fielding told TIME last week that he has also constituted a small new committee to advise the President on Supreme Court nominations . There are only three members : Fielding , Attorney General Edwin Meese and White House Chief of Staff Donald Regan . " We do n't expect a vacancy , " said Fielding , " but we 're prepared . " <P> The Burger court is the second oldest in history , with an average age of 70 , less than two years younger than the Nine Old Men who made Franklin Roosevelt miserable until they began leaving the court in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever to have a majority of its members 76 or over , " calculates Harvard Law Professor Laurence Tribe . Even the younger Justices have reached the outer edges of middle age . The youngest , Sandra Day O'Connor , celebrated her 55th birthday last week . <P> While such a heavy concentration of venerability on one court is unusual , 34 of the 102 Justices have continued past their 75th birthdays , including such luminaries as John Marshall , Roger Taney , Oliver Wendell Holmes and Louis &lt; Brandeis . John Harlan , who retired in 1971 at the age of 72 , became nearly blind at the end of his tenure , but " those last five years made him one of the greatest Justices in history , " says Stanford Constitutional Scholar Gerald Gunther . On the other hand , Harlan 's longtime colleague and adversary Hugo Black , who did not retire until just before his death at 85 , seemed to decline . " The nicest thing you could say is that he was not as vigorous in his last years , " says Columbia Law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
