txt SOON , THIS INCREDIBLE journey will be over . Spectacular Bid will run at Arlington Park July 19 . Then it will be on to the East Coast for perhaps four more races . And then , like all superstars , Spectacular Bid will retire to the roar of the crowd , his place in history assured even if he fails to sire a specacular son . Bud Delp , who has watched over this thoroughbred as attentively as a father watches over his son , wo n't know quite how to feel then . " I 'll still make one trip a year to Kentucky , where The Bid will be breeding , " he says . " And I 'll drop by to say hello and bring him some carrots . It 'll be different , though . " Bud Delp 's life has been different ever since he met Spectacular Bid . He 'd always been a successful trainer ; your horses do n't win 2,700 races If you 're a dolt . But like all the men in his business who dream of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his lifetime had come . WIfEN THE BID was purchased for $37,000 at the annual fall sales in Lexington , there was no reason to expect that this yearling would be anything more than a stakes winner . Generally , that is the greatest expectation a horseman harbors for a horse . And when , one day , Spectacular Bid almost trampled Bud Delp dead in pique , there were other thoughts . " I thought , " recalls Delp , " he might be a rogue . " But then , one morning in a workout , Spectacular Bid glided over the track , and Bud Delp suspected he had a prodigy . When this compact , well-muscled gray streak won the World 's Playground at Atlantic City in 1978 by 15 lengths , Delp 's suspicions were confirmed . " I knew then that we had a great one , " Delp says , " a horse that did his thing in The morning , then went out and played with the opposition in the afternoon . After that day in New Jersey , I knew there was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bid 's unmatched career as a three-year-old , and now as a four-year-old six victories in six California races , has produced earnings of $2,394,267 , plus well-earned consideration as perhaps  --  to borrow from Delp ? " the best thing on four legs to ever look through a bridle . " IN A COLD , hard business , Delp talks reverently , almost gently , about Spectacular . Bid . When the telephone rang in his van outside the paddock area Wednesday morning and someone broached the subject of welcoming the public to watch his horse gallop at dawn Saturday , Delp said : " A good idea , but I 'll have to speak to The Bid about it first . " And when . you resurrect memories of the 1979 Belmont , when Spectacular Bid missed the Triple Crown only because he stepped on a safety pin , Bud Delp speaks like a father who had watched his boy break a leg sliding into second base during a Little League game . " He was very ill for two weeks , " Delp says . " Did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three hours a day to isolate the infection . He could have been finished . A difficult time for both of us . " Now , though neither will admit as much , it is again a difficult time for both of them , because it is almost over . NOT TIIAT THE fire is gone . Not at all . After all he has endured  --  horses train just like prizefighters , do n't forget  --  Spectacular Bid is most comfortable , perhaps comfortable only , when running . " It 's fun for him , play , he loves it , " says Delp . " Does he know he 's good ? Does he know he 's the best ? Well , I do n't think horses have a great IQ , and I know they have short memories . But he does have sort of a routine , and going to the winner 's circle after a race probably is part of it . Put it this way . He 's been there 23 times , so he knows where it is . " And , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he sees a horse out front of him . He sees that , he wants to eat that horse alive . That 's part of his personality , part of any great athlete 's personality . I think he knows something is up , too . You train a horse to peak at 5 o'clock on a particular Saturday afternoon . At 3 o'clock that afternoon , you look at the eyes of The Bid , and suddenly he 's more alert . He knows something is up . " Something will be up in the $250,000-added Washington Park Stakes a week from Saturday . Bet a dollar on The Bid , and you may get a nickel back , but the idea of this race is n't to see a minus pool . Rather , the idea is to see Spectacular Bid . IIE HAS RACED EAST , West and in Florida , but never in the Midwest . By putting Spectacular Bid on tour , owners Harry , Teresa and Tom Meyerhoff are n't doing themselves any favors as much as they are doing railbirds a favor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't need the whip anymore . " It 's their way of saying ' thanks ' , " said Delp . " Spectacular Bid is one of the great athletes of our time . He 's 0 . J. Simpson , he 's Ali . If they were putting on an exhibition , people who are n't even fans of those sports , I think , would come out to see them . It 's good for racing . " Bud Delp thinks the chances of Spectacular Bid fathering a chip off the old block are better than usual . Citation flopped , among others , because he raced until he was six and was overworked . But Delp likes the manner In which the Meyer-hefts have arranged The Bid 's social life . The who 's who in the world of mares will be his , if he so wishes . lf , uh , nothing happens , so be it . Spectacular Bid will go down as one of a kind , a horse of uncommon acceleration , a horse who changes leads so adroitly that the jockey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with heart . When Spectacular Bid races here July 19 , it may not be worth your white to bet , only to watch .
