The term junk bonds conjures up an image of useless certificates sitting in a pile in someone 's garage . Nonetheless , junk bonds , which originally were issued mostly by companies in financial trouble , have taken on a slick new role as a money-raising device for corporate-takeover artists and entrepreneurial companies . The amount of junk-bond issues has grown from $3 billion in 1982 to $14.3 billion last year . &; <P> The proliferation of the paper , though , is causing both moneymen and legislators to wonder whether the junk pile could collapse . Last week New Mexico Republican Pete Domenici introduced a Senate bill that would halt the feverish growth by putting a moratorium until the end of the year on most takeovers financed by junk bonds . The bill could put a stop to deals like Corporate Raider T. Boone Pickens ' plan to acquire Unocal with some $3 billion in junk bonds , one of the largest issues ever proposed . <P> The deal maker behind Pickens and most other corporate sharks is the investment firm Drexel Burnham Lambert , which controls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Michael Milken , 39 , developed today 's market in junk bonds almost single-handed after researching them in 1969 as an M.B.A . student at Wharton School . Milken showed that junk bonds defaulted only slightly more often than prestige certificates , yet paid interest rates 3% to 4% higher . During the late 1970s , he patiently persuaded such big investors as pension funds and banks that the bonds were safe , and Drexel began issuing mounds of them . Milken 's control of junk bonds is so complete that in 1978 , when he moved back to his native California and began working out of Beverly Hills , much of his clientele moved with him . Last year Milken earned an estimated $15 million . <P> Critics charge that today 's euphoria in the junk-bond market could be shattered by even one major default . Says Preston Martin , vice chairman of the Federal Reserve Board : " The market has not been tested by some significant negative surprises , which inevitably will come at some point . " A default would probably cause no substantial damage to pension @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep only a small part of their portfolio in such certificates . But federal regulators are concerned about the increasing amount of junk-bond investing by banks and by savings and loans . Says Norman Raiden , chief counsel of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board : " Junk bonds are likely to be most attractive to distressed institutions that need high yields . " As a result , the Domenici bill would forbid banks and savings and loans to buy any junk bonds at all .
