CHARLOTTE SWEET <P> Books and Lyrics by Michael Colby ; <P> Music by Gerald Jay Markoe <P> Music hall was for Britain what vaudeville was for an earlier America and what a TV variety show often still is : a potpourri of songs , sketches and buffoonery so good-naturedly crude that it becomes accepted as the quintessential wholesome family entertainment . Few in England remember music hall ; in America , even fewer have heard anything beyond the comic ditties that used to serve to round out the hour on PBS after episodes of Upstairs , Downstairs . Yet with the passion of theater people for unearthing every oddment of stage history , an off-Broadway team has assembled Charlotte Sweet , an ingratiating pastiche that re-creates typical music hall turns and simultaneously concocts a conventional Victorian melodrama among the members of a particularly nutty touring troupe . <P> Nothing is subtle in Charlotte , starting with the sound ; as in many current productions , the microphones have been so amplified that Gerald Jay Markoe 's songs lose much of their tunefulness and practically blast back-row patrons out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for hummability in tongue-in-cheek ballads , including Liverpool Sunset and <P> Good Things Come , and for counterpoint in Quartet Agonistes . <P> Librettist Colby 's campy , hit-or-miss humor works best in a scene describing the heroine 's mother , a " chronic shiverer " who goes to her reward wearing enough garments to stock a branch of Marks &; Spencer . Other beguiling wackinesses : a song about a man who makes eating vegetables seem a sexual experience , the vocal travails of a hiccuping , stuttering woman who has " bubbles in her bonnet , " and the soprano heroine 's sudden loss of her " high note , " which she regains at the price of addiction-to helium sucked from balloons . In less good taste is a character called Skitzy , who talks in voices high and low , has two personalities , and eerily resembles the shopping-bag ladies who wander big-city streets . <P> The plot is straightforward boy-meets-girl and depends on such conventions as a villain in a top hat and rescuers in disguises ( one does a drag impersonation of Queen Victoria ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , yet in one serendipitous moment a painted cloth is lit from behind to become a foggy , gaslit , sweeping vista of a Sherlock Holmes-style England . <P> Director Edward Stone has set a frenetic pace that jams to a halt , like traffic in a rush-hour gridlock , whenever the entire eight-actor ensemble crowds onto the stage . The performances , though a bit broad for so intimate a space , are clever : Mara Beckerman is just irksome enough as the naive heroine , Alan Brasington swishily grand as her abductor , and Merle Louise , Polly Pen and especially Emcee Michael McCormick polished and persuasive as show-must-go-on troupers . The music hall genre may be dead , but Charlotte Sweet is an amiable , spirited resurrection . <P> - By William A. Henry III
