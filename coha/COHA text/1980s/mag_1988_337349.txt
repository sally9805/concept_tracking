" On the plantations , a strong black man was mated with a strong black woman . ( ( Blacks ) ) were simply bred for physical qualities . " <P> Those are not the words of Jimmy ( " the Greek " ) Snyder , the football speculator cashiered by CBS Sports for enunciating a virtually identical sentiment in a Martin Luther King Day interview . Rather they were spoken by black Olympic Gold Medalist Lee Evans , a militant protester against white racism during the 1960s . Evans was quoted in a 1971 SPORTS ILLUSTRATED article on the purported physiological differences between blacks and whites . In that story , among many other things , experts claimed that what Coach Al Campanis more recently declared was true : blacks are less buoyant . If there are significant genetic differences between blacks and whites , the ability to spew psuedohistorical nonsense about racial distinctions is one trait both races have in common and in abundance . <P> The notion that systematic efforts to improve the prowess of slaves by selective breeding have something to do with black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myths in America 's overflowing collection of racist ideas . Historians as diverse as Ulrich B. Phillips , a staunch defender of the Confederacy , and Eugene Genovese , a Marxist , have convincingly shown that there was no widespread deliberate mating of slaves . This preposterous theory has nevertheless wormed its way into the collective consciousness through such classic works of pulp fiction as Mandingo . It is probably no coincidence that Kyle Onstott , creator of that lurid depiction of the couplings between and within the races on a fictional slave-rearing plantation , was also the author of The New Art of Breeding Better Dogs . <P> A century of efforts to quantify physiological differences between the races has yielded plenty of anthropological mumbo jumbo . In the early days of Darwinism , some European scholars suggested that the major races had each descended from a different species of ape : Caucasians from chimpanzees , the most intelligent nonhuman primates ; Orientals from orangutans ; and Negroes from gorillas , the biggest and blackest of all . <P> More recently , attention has focused on blacks ' supposedly longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give blacks an advantage over whites in jumping and sprinting . Most evolutionists dismiss attempts to link race and individual excellence as silly . " The differences between the races are very small , " says Harvard Paleontologist Stephen Jay Gould , " just tiny compared to the variation within races . " When specialists compared the legs of Jesse Owens and Frank Wykoff , the leading black and white sprinters of the 1930s , they discovered that Owens ' calf muscles more closely resembled the presumed white model , while Wykoff 's were in the black mold . <P> How then could the Greek , who at $500,000 a year presumably knew how to keep his football out of his mouth , say something so stupid ? The explanation really lies in his subsequent warning that " if blacks take over coaching like everybody wants them to , there is not going to be anything left for the white people .
