What was lost in Iran , and why it wo n't happen again <P> After the cheering stops over the return of the hostages from Iran , the Senate Foreign Relations Committee plans to open hearings later this month to determine the lessons that the U.S. should learn from the crisis . Sooner or later , questions will be raised about what vital intelligence secrets were lost and how such breaches of security can be avoided in the future . <P> Some of the answers have been pieced together by U.S. officials with the help of information supplied by the hostages during their debriefings . It has been confirmed that as the militants stormed the embassy , U.S. officials managed to destroy most , if not all , of the sensitive communications equipment . No codes were compromised ; indeed , none could have been because encoding is done by computers that , in effect , change their combination every one hundred-thousandth of a second . <P> The contents of most safes were also destroyed by fire-producing grenades . But not all . Those in the offices of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ official , and Michael Me-trinko , a political officer , were captured intact . As a result , the militants gained a treasure trove of information . It included several compromising documents that , according to State Department officials , should have been shredded soon after Laingen received them . <P> One of the documents indicated that two U.S. officials , William Daugherty and Malcolm Kalp , were CIA officers . In addition , a notation ( " Show to Tom A. " ) in the margin was taken by the militants as evidence that another embassy official , Thomas Ahern , was also connected with the agency . The three Americans suffered harsher treatment than most hostages . <P> Kalp was beaten twice and kept in solitary confinement for 374 days . <P> These documents did not disclose the identity of any local CIA agents . The reason is that such names are stored only in a computer at the agency 's headquarters in Langley , Va . But embassy files did contain records of Iranians who called at the embassy on commercial or cultural business . U.S. officials believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the revolutionary komitehs and , in some cases , executed . Indeed , some U.S. officials are surprised that the Iranian militants did not make more use of the sensitive information that was known to be in Laingen 's safe . <P> One of the reasons may be that some militant clerical leaders also had incriminating files in the embassy . Among them were Ayatullah Mohammed Beheshti , head of the Iranian Supreme Court , and Seyyed Ali Khamene'i , a leader of the Islamic Republican Party , who both had numerous contacts with the embassy before and after the fall of the late Shah . <P> Perhaps even more serious was the loss of sensitive papers in a U.S. helicopter that was abandoned after the unsuccessful rescue attempt in April 1980 . Following that debacle , the U.S. had to make urgent efforts to get some undercover agents out of Iran . Says a senior U.S. official : " We were really scrambling for a while . " The documents in the helicopter also provided locations of safe houses , procedures and codes for use in making contact with local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plans were quickly changed .
