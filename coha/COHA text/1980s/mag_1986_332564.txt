A year ago the gangling , inexhaustible teenager became the youngest man ever to win the singles title at Wimbledon . Last week Boris Becker , 18 , made it clear that the improbable victory was no fluke . He beat the world 's No. 1- ranked player , Ivan Lendl , 26 , in straight sets with a 150-m.p.h. serve that blurred across the center court 's slick grass surface for 15 aces and with volleys that edged deep or skidded down the sidelines . For the West German wunderkind , this year 's win was even sweeter than last year 's . At a postgame press conference he announced , " I really proved I can play well on grass and proved I can be a Wimbledon champion . " But on courts other than grass , he modestly allowed , " I am just one of the best . I 'm still beatable . I 'm human . "
