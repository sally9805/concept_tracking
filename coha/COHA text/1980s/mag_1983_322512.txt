Pro basketball 's endurance contest is down to two <P> The nature of basketball , some would say the flaw in basketball , is that the game is nearly always won or lost at the center position . Julius ( " Dr. J " ) Erving of Philadelphia and Earvin ( " Magic " ) Johnson of Los Angeles lead their teams artistically , but Erving is a forward and Johnson a guard . It is around the 76ers ' Moses Malone and the Lakers ' Kareem Abdul-Jabbar , the centers , that the current championship series , and the basketball universe itself , revolves . <P> For the purposes of easy identification , Abdul-Jabbar , 36,7 ft. 2 in. , six times the National Basketball Association 's Most Valuable Player , is being called the " center of the ' 70s . " Malone , 28 , 6 ft. 10 in. , soon to be named M.V.P. of the league for a third time , is the " center of the ' 80s . " They are so unalike they are fascinating . Abdul-Jabbar is complex , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , largely on the strength of his relentless offensive rebounding , he thanked his teammates for missing so many shots . " Kareem is the best player of all time , " says Moses flatly . But he also says , " If I can get close to the hole , I do n't care who is in there . It 's over . " For him , basketball and life seem to be simple matters . <P> Abdul-Jabbar is more of an aesthete , a sky-hooker , not a slam-dunker , devastatingly shy . He has never been able to hide the shame of his height . Fourteen years ago , Abdul-Jabbar ( n Lew Alcindor , U.C.L.A. ' 69 ) told Teammate Jon McGlocklin that he intended to play no more than five seasons of pro ball . Recently he ran into McGlocklin , who reminded him of this . It started Kareem reflecting on this job that he has only lately considered a profession . " It 's getting to be scary , " he says , " all the teammates and opponents who have come and gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself and the road . " Sometimes I think of the N.B.A. as an endurance contest . Five games in six nights . You want to give your best , but you have n't got it to give . You know , when I won my first N.B.A. championship in Milwaukee 1971 , the final game was on April 30 . Now it is getting on to June . " <P> Even to himself , Kareem has a hard time explaining why he is still here , aside from his $1.1 million salary . " It 's talent in the beginning and good fortune throughout , but desire maybe most of all , " he says , as if it surprises him to realize he loves the game that much . " I just hung in there until in the last few years I came to appreciate the game as a career . " <P> Kareem 's " angry period " - Lakers Coach Pat Riley 's phrase-has passed . " He has been measured and judged on a different scale his whole life , " says Riley . " He has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world . Basketball is a double-standard game . The referees will protect anyone else from the centers , but the centers have to protect themselves . They 're penalized for how big or how strong or how good they are . Life must have always seemed unfair to Kareem , but I do n't think he thinks of it that way so much any more . "
