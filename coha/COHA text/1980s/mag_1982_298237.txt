With James Watt in charge , the Interior Department means business <P> When James Gaius Watt was in the third grade in Lusk , Wyo. ( pop . 1,800 ) , his mother organized a club called the Five Rabbits , which consisted of the five Watts . " We 'd elect officers , " says Lois Watt , now 71 , " and the kid that got to be president held office for a month . " That formality , Lois Watt says , was the way she and her husband William , now 75 , " trained the children how to make motions , make amendments and so on . " It was the right of each child , while president , to set the Five Rabbits ' agenda . The girls , Elizabeth and Judith , would usually opt to lead family sing-alongs or recite poems . Not James , the serious middle child . " Jim , " remembers his mother , " would like to make speeches . " Today ? " He has high ideals , " she says , " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Interior Secretary James Watt , 44 , has lost none of that astringent seriousness of his Wyoming boyhood . Even more , he still seems powered by youth 's missionary energy , the sense of absolute righteousness that maturity usually softens . " It is really very simple , " Watt says of his really very complex duties as manager of the Government 's 1.5 billion acres of land and water . " America must have abundant energy if we are to secure our freedom and liberty and create jobs . " For Watt , that means a rather sudden , gear-grinding tilt toward private exploitation of Government-owned natural resources , toward drilling and mining and away from a supposedly too scrupulous preservation of nature . <P> Watt is the most controversial member of Reagan 's Cabinet ( every major conservation group and 40 members of Congress have called for his resignation ) and probably the farthest right . Like the President , Watt is , above all , bent on reducing the power of the Federal Government . The anger he incites , however , stems not just from his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from his preachy , pugnacious style . " Jim Watt just stimulates every single emotion , " says Wyoming Senator Alan Simpson , one of the Secretary 's oldest friends . " People flunk the saliva test when they think of him : there he is , with this great , leering grin . . . " Demonstrators taunt him everywhere he goes . <P> Even Watt 's allies in business and Government think his provocative rhetoric and willful manner are sometimes counterproductive . And perhaps because Watt , as Simpson says , " is convinced that he has God on his side , " he can hardly bring himself to make even a pretense of accommodation . " There are some people , " Watt says about his huge mob of critics , " who will never be brought around to my philosophy . And I pray I never yield to their positions . They are wrong .
