NEWPORT , R.I. - For the first few minutes , John Fitzgerald was in trouble . If anyone was expected to have early problems in the final of the Hall of Fame Classic , it was supposed to be the other guy , 20-year- old Scott Davis , not Fitzgerald . After all , Davis was playing in only his second tournament as a professional and this was his first pro final . But Davis wasn ' t nervous . He wasn ' t scared . The only thing he was in the first set was ahead , 6-2 , at the end . Fitzgerald , the No. 3 seed in the tournament , had all the problems . " Nothing was going right for me and he was getting a lot of confidence , " Fitzgerald said . " When you ' re in that sort of predicament , all you can do is keep your head together and hope things turn around . " They finally did . Fitzgerald , the veteran of this final at the age of 22 , put an end to Davis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2-6 , 6-1 , 6-2 . Thirty minutes later , he walked back onto the grass courts of the Newport Casino to win the doubles title and another $3000 . Fitzgerald and his partner , Vijay Amritraj , defeated Tim and Tom Gullikson , 6-3 , 6-4 . It was his second Volvo Grand Prix singles title ( Maui , 1982 , was the first ) and the first time he had won both singles and doubles championships in the same tournament . From the way the afternoon started , though , it didn ' t look like it was going to be a productive day . Fitzgerald , from Cummings , Australia , won just one point off his serve in the first game of the match and Davis easily held his service in the second game , allowing Fitzgerald just one point . " We had a couple of good points early and I happened to win them and I started to feel pretty good , " Davis said . Davis broke Fitzgerald again to go up , 5-2 , and then held to take the first set . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as quickly as he had gained it in the first . He had a 40-15 lead in the fourth game of the second , but Fitzgerald came back to break his serve and go up , 3-1 . Then Davis had twobreak points on Fitzgerald in the next game , but he hit a couple of bad shots and Fitzgerald came back to win the game and bolt ahead , 4-1 . " I had good chances in both of those games and I slipped up , " said Davis , who is from Santa Monica , Calif. , and played three years at Stanford . " Instead of coming out and attacking the ball , I started to chip at it.That ' s not my game . I lost those games and then I let it bother me . It was just a lapse of concentration and a lack of confidence . " " That was a big difference , " Fitzgerald said . " Instead of 4-1 , it could have been 3-2 and that ' s all the difference in the world . I think he got down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ win the second set so easy , but I knew I had to get an early break in the next set to keep the momentum going . " Fitzgerald got that break in the third game when Davis double- faulted at deuce and then hit a backhand into the net . Fitzgerald led , 2-1 , and then he held serve to go up , 3-1 . The only time Fitzgerald looked out of control in the final two sets was in the sixth game of the last set . Up , 3-2 , in games and 30- 15 in the sixth game , Davis hit a high lob . While Fitzgerald was waiting for it to come down , someone shouted something from the stands . Fitzgerald hit his overhead smash long . He went first to the stands to say something to the fan , then he went to referee to ask to play the point over . " That was a pretty tight stage of the match , " Fitzgerald said . " I was just uptight . You expect the crowd to make noises . They can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' t have missed that shot . But I calmed down . " He went on to win that game and then broke Davis ' serve to open a 5-2 lead .
