When the Pentagon detected irregularities in its audit of General Electric 's contract to replace the warheads on Minuteman missiles , it did not file a civil suit . Instead , in an unusual move , it referred the case to the Justice Department for criminal prosecution . Last week U.S. Attorney Edward Dennis Jr . announced that a federal grand jury in Philadelphia had returned an indictment against G.E . for allegedly defrauding the Air Force of more than $800,000 . In a swift and stiff follow-up punch , the Pentagon declared that it was temporarily barring G.E . from any new military contracts . As if that were not enough , the Pentagon disclosed that it was taking another " exceptional action " against the company , demanding that it voluntarily return what the Defense Department considers excess profits collected on contracts for Navy and Air Force jet spare parts . Amount of the requested refund : $168 million . <P> The one-two-three attack on G.E. , the nation 's fourth-largest military supplier ( an estimated $4.5 billion in contracts in 1984 ) , is only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the defense industry . Last week the Defense Department revealed that it has hit Pratt &; Whitney for a refund of $40 million in higher-than-expected profits made supplying jet- engine spare parts . The widest barrel , however , remains pointed at General Dynamics , the country 's top defense contractor , which found itself facing investigations by a federal grand jury in Connecticut and a congressional subcommittee as well as by Pentagon auditors ( see following story ) . <P> The Pentagon crackdown comes just when the Reagan Administration is battling to push its enormous defense budget through an increasingly combative Congress . The White House has called for military spending to increase by 12.7% in fiscal 1986 , to $277.5 billion . But critics , incensed by stories of $7,600 coffeemakers and $400 hammers , are now challenging the price that the Pentagon pays for everything from wrenches to warplanes . Air Force Secretary Verne Orr acknowledged the public furor in his dunning letters to G.E . and Pratt &; Whitney : " National support for building military strength has been severely battered by public perception that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
