Several key Drexel employees , including junk bond czar Michael R. Milken , are reported to be among some 40 to 50 Wall Street players being subpoenaed by the government. // A subpoena is not a sign of wrongdoing . Drexel has not been accused of anything illegal . But Drexel has been in the forefront of almost every major takeover battle in recent years . This has primarily been through the issuance of junk bonds , which are high-interest , high-risk notes and are often used to finance stock purchases in takeovers . And Drexel worked closely with arbitrager Ivan F. Boesky on a number of occasions. // // So Wall Street can ' t help wondering : Will Drexel or its stars be tainted by the probe ? Could the junk bond market survive the loss of Mr. Milken ? Could competitors pick up the slack ? // Such speculation has already prompted First Chicago Corporation to pare its holdings of junk bonds . Other banks and insurance firms are watching Drexel ' s junk bond inventory for signs of trouble in selling the high-yield securities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ posher quarters , citing tax law changes and Boesky-related distractions. // The bad press and gossip have hurt . Twice since the Boesky imbroglio broke on Nov. 14 , Drexel has had to deny rumors that Milken had left . The firm has not lost any established clients , but ' ' I think there has been some harm done on the new-business side , ' ' Drexel ' s chief executive officer , Frederick H. Joseph , said recently. // Competitors are ' ' licking their chops ' ' over this , says Edward Altman , a New York University professor , consultant , and author of a new book , ' ' Investing in Junk Bonds. ' ' // In the four years before 1986 , Drexel underwrote 55 to 65 percent of all nonconvertible , low-grade , high-yield debt . This year , its share has dropped to about 46 percent. // And in the last three months , according to Dr. Altman , Drexel has garnered only 26. 6 percent of the new junk bond business . Morgan Stanley captured 21. 2 percent of the action - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even before Boesky broke , ' ' Altman says . ' ' My guess is that will continue as more players get established. ' ' // But when it comes to mega-deals , nobody does it better than Drexel. // ' ' I don ' t think any organization has demonstrated the capacity to raise the amounts of capital that Drexel has , ' ' says Joseph Rice , president of Clayton Dubilier , a New York leveraged-buyout firm. // Salomon Brothers is facing a crucial test of its junk bond underwriting talents in placing $800 million in high-yield debt to finance a management-led buyout of Revco D.S. Inc . Drexel has done six larger deals , including $2. 5 billion for Beatrice Foods . But for Salomon , it ' s the biggest ever , and its success ( or failure ) could influence future junk bond forays. // Merrill Lynch and First Boston have also put together the financing for a couple of large deals recently , but unlike Drexel they have had to put up their own capital as bridge loans. // ' ' When the funds come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which must be kept at certain levels by law ) , that has to limit their capacity to do deals , ' ' Mr. Rice says . ' ' Drexel can do a variety of large deals virtually simultaneously. ' ' // The key to Drexel ' s strength is the network of wealthy buyers Milken has cultivated over the years . Indeed , the $120 billion junk bond market was pioneered almost single-handedly by Milken ' s Beverly Hills , Calif. , operation. // Junk bonds have been the rocket powering Drexel ' s rapid ascent from relative obscurity to one of biggest firms on Wall Street . Revenues this year are expected to hit $4 billion , up from just $600 million five years ago . The firm has diversified considerably , and profits have doubled since last year , reaching $550 million in 1986. // Drexel has amassed $1. 7 billion in capital , but if the firm itself were somehow implicated by the Boesky scandal , fines or lawsuits could have an impact . And Drexel would need that capital if it had to maintain a market @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' s been assured that the federal investigators are after individuals , not the firm . But no one denies that if Milken were to leave Drexel , for whatever reason , the gap would be enormous . Drexel pays Milken an estimated $30 million to $40 million annually . Without him , Drexel ' s revenues might drop by one-quarter to one-third , Joseph said in a recent interview in Fortune magazine. // It would also be a stinging blow to the entire junk bond market , given Drexel ' s prominence . But most analysts believe it would be a short-lived problem. // ' ' The junk bond market has advanced to a point where it ' s beyond damage by any one individual or any one firm , ' ' says Robert S. Wail , senior vice-president of corporate bond research at L.F. Rothschild , Unterberg , Towbin . ' ' I couldn ' t say that five years ago , but I can now. ' ' // Still , some institutional buyers are waiting to see how all this pans out , and some large takeovers have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bonds and more-conservative investments have widened . Junk bond yields have risen in the last month from 4 to 5 percent above Treasury bonds to about 6 percent. // But it ' s not clear whether the rise is due to concern about Drexel , to a year-end rush that ' s creating an oversupply , or to some **25;47265;TOOLONG bonds coming to market now . Drexel officials point out they have done $1. 5 billion in deals over the last week or two . Although there are reports Drexel has struggled with some recent deals , it hasn ' t reneged on a ' ' highly confident ' ' letter yet. // ( Drexel secures commitments from bond buyers before issuing a letter telling the suitor in a takeover play that it is ' ' highly confident ' ' it can pull together the financing if the bid succeeds . Much of Drexel ' s reputation has been built on that assurance. ) // Meanwhile , individual investors don ' t appear to be worried enough to abandon the double-digit yields offered by junk bond mutual funds. // ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ substantial reaction , but all the evidence isn ' t out yet , ' ' says Michael Lipper of Lipper Analytical Services , which tracks mutual fund performance . ' ' The key point is that we haven ' t seen an increase in the default rate recently ; therefore , people are still getting a good return. ' ' // //
