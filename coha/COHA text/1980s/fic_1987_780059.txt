 | She turned her head to gaze at him with perplexity . " I had assumed you were android or human , like the others . You resemble those . " " I am crafted to resemble them , just as you are . But my interior operations are no more human than are yours . " He spotted a dining region . " Do you wish to eat ? " " That is appealing , " she agreed . He guided her to one of the food dispensers . " You may describe whatever you wish , and it will craft it for you , " he said . " I am incompletely familiar with local custom . Perhaps I should attempt whatever you choose to consume . " Mach smiled . " Oh , I do n't have to eat . My power cell takes care of my energy needs . " " Yes , of course ; you are a machine . Perhaps we should dispense with this activity , in that case . " Mach considered . He suspected that she was hungry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was afraid to make her own choice . " I can eat , " he said . " I merely do not need to . Suppose I order nutro-drink for each of us ? " " My gratitude . " Indeed , she was almost fawning . He placed the order , and in a moment they had two tall containers of the beverage , complete with straws . " Is it permissible to be private ? " she asked . " Certainly . " He showed the way to a booth , and the curtain closed about them , cutting off all sight and sound of the remainder of the dining alcove . Mach sipped his drink , using the straw . Agape hesitated . " It is a matter of generating a partial vacuum in the mouth , " he explained . " That causes the pressure of the air to push the fluid up through the straw . " " My concern is not of that nature , " she said . " I am an alien , amoebic in nature . I can maintain the human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so for imbibation . I am concerned that my mode of assimilation would be a social indiscretion in your presence . " " I will of course leave the booth if you prefer , " Mach said . " But I am scientifically interested in your biology , and I am not subject to annoyance because of differing modes of operation . "  | Still she hesitated . " Narda termed it gross . ' I believe that is why she preferred to separate herself from me . " Androids were notorious for their crudities of behavior and humor . What could Narda have found gross ? " Please be reassured , Agape . I am a machine . I have no emotion not programmed , and even those can be evoked or revoked at will . Nothing you might do would dismay me . " " You are certain ? " " I am certain . " " Then I shall assimilate this material . " She put her hands to the container and stretched it wide , so that it gradually reformed into a broad , shallow dish . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the empty containers were normally compacted into balls and rolled into the recycling hopper , but he had never before seen a person reform one while it was full of fluid . Now she leaned forward , bringing her head directly over the dish . Her features melted , the nose , eyes , ears and mouth disappearing . Her head receded into her neck , and her breasts lifted to join it , forming a single globular mass above the table . This mass flattened and descended until it covered the full dish . The flesh dipped into the beverage . In the course of the next few minutes the beverage disappeared , absorbed into the pancake-shaped mass of flesh . The amoeba was assimilating nourishment in the fashion of its kind . Then the mass lifted , forming another glob . The glob stretched out , narrowing to form the neck , bulging below to fashion breasts , and shaping gradually back into the human features above . The configuration he recognized as Agape returned , features clean , eyes and mouth closed . The eyes opened , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my presence now ? " she asked . " No . I find your process of assimilation fascinating . " " It is not gross to you ? " " It is educational to me . I appreciate being shown it . " She looked at him without further comment . He remembered to resume work on his own drink .  | " If I may inquire without offense , " she said , " how is it that you , a machine , have been crafted in human form ? I have seen other machines in other forms , suited to their tasks . " " I am what is known as a humanoid robot . I have been crafted to resemble a living human being as closely as is feasible , in both the physical and mental states . It is part of my father 's effort to integrate the self-willed machines into the society of Proton . If humanoid ones can be successful at this , then the nonhumanoid ones can follow . " " But do not human beings grow from small creatures formed within the bodies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a father . " " I have a father and a mother , " Mach said firmly . " My father is Citizen Blue , an immigrant from the frame of Phaze . My mother is Sheen , a female robot . It is possible for a female robot to be implanted with a human egg-cell that can be fertilized internally by a human male , and for her to nourish that cell in the laboratory of her body and birth it in the human fashion , becoming a surrogate mother to his child . But Sheen elected not to be modified to accommodate this ; she preferred to have a robot baby , like herself . Therefore I am a robot , but my basic programming makes my awareness and intellectual quotient very similar to those of my father . " " But then you were constructed as an adult , fully formed as you are now . " I was crafted as a robot baby , incontinent and untrained . I was adjusted for growth on a weekly basis , trained and educated by hand . Periodically my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I never changed size or appearance in any large step . In this manner I proceeded in the course of sixteen years to my present size , and thereafter have remained constant . I was put through normal human schooling , along with the androids , cyborgs and human beings of my group . I regard myself as a human being in all except flesh . " " You are very like a human being , " she agreed . " I did not realize your nature until you advised me . But what is the point of this significant effort ? " " To demonstrate that complete integration of the diverse intelligent elements of our society is feasible , " he replied . " In the  | bast there has been discrimination against robots , cyborgs and androids . In the future all will participate on an equal basis . " " And perhaps aliens too , " she agreed . " Now the rationale behind my own participation becomes clear . I was not informed by my own planetary authorities ; I was simply given my assignment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is true . But the job is not yet complete , and there is substantial opposition . We must all be careful . " " Opposition ? I did not realize . " " The majority of Citizens would have preferred to retain the prior system , in which only chosen human beings had power , and only human beings were eligible to compete for Citizenship . " " You mentioned this before . What is a Citizen ? " " A member of the governing class of Proton . Citizens have enormous power , and the right to wear clothing . We serfs must address any Citizen as ' sir ' and obey any directive he gives . " " But I had understood that serfs had opportunity to achieve power . That if I succeeded in accommodating myself to this society , such opportunity would become mine . " " This is true , but such opportunity is limited . A Citizen can confer an inheritance of his position on a designated heir , the new Citizen to exist when the old Citizen dies or abdicates . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assume his Citizen status , and be perhaps the first robot Citizen . But there is doubt that this will come to pass , because the Council of Citizens may succeed in outlawing such accession . It is also possible for any serf to win Citizenship through the annual Tourney , as I mentioned ; this is in effect how Blue obtained his position , though it was actually won by his alternate self . " " Alternate self ? Is this an aspect of human existence ? " Mach smiled . " In a manner . Most residents of Proton have an analog in the sister-frame of Phaze , wherein science is supposed to be inoperative and magic is operative . I find this difficult to credit , but my father claims it is so , and I am not programmed to believe him to be in error . It is at any rate academic , as there is no access to Phaze . " Agape brightened . " A human myth ! " she exclaimed . " A thing known to be untrue , but believed regardless . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the matter , " he agreed .  | " Do you , a machine , have any desire for the future ? " " None that can be realized . " " But perhaps a myth ? A hope you would possess if it were reasonable ? " " I would desire to be alive , " Mach said . " Yet you are not , and can never be . " " Therefore it is pointless to desire it , " he concluded . Again she gazed at him in her somewhat disconcertingly alien manner . " I think that I shall now be able to exist in this society . I thank you for your assistance . Perhaps at some point I may be able to render you a similar favor of comprehension . " " There is no need . " They stood and left the booth . " Ha ! " a young woman cried , spotting them . She had hair that was almost orange , that flounced about her shoulders as she moved . " So it 's true ! " Mach knew that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allow me to explain ? " he began . " Shut in a booth with another woman ! " she flared . " With the privacy curtain in place ! I do n't need any explanation for that ! " " But we were n't doing anything , " he protested . " Agape required assistance ? " " I can guess what kind ! " Doris cried , eying Agape 's torso . " Just could n't wait to get your hands on some alien flesh , could you ! " " I do not understand , " Agape said . " Have I committed an error of protocol ? " " Protocol ! " Doris said . " Is that what you call it ? Melting in his arms ? " " She did n't ? " Mach began . " I did melt , " Agape agreed . " But not for his arms . " " Do n't tell me for what part of him you melted ! " Doris cried . She whirled to confront Mach . " And I thought I was your girl ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you see a chance to grab something new ? " " You misunderstand ? " Mach said . " Not any more ! You and I are through ! " " Please listen , " Mach said , reaching out to her . " I never ? " Doris stepped in and ; lapped him resoundingly on the cheek . " Do n't lie to me , metal-heart ! "  | By this time a small crowd had gathered to admire the proceedings . One young man stepped up . " Is this machine bothering you , Doris ? " " Stay out of this , Ware ! " Mach snapped , allowing his emotional circuits to govern in the human manner . Ware was an android , and Mach had had enough android-sponsored trouble for this day . " Yeah ? Make me ! " Doris ' gaze passed from one to the other appraisingly . She was a cyborg , and by all accounts there were ghosts in those machines . A person could never be quite certain what a cyborg would do . " Yes , why do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She was trying to promote a combat between them ! Mach had to head that off , in the interest of species harmony ; he knew how his father would react to any such episode . " The Game , " Mach said . " We 'll settle this in the Game . " Ware laughed coarsely . " The Game ? Why should I bother ? Why not just settle it right here ? " Naturally the android did n't care what kind of a scene he made ; he had nothing to lose , and perhaps a lot to gain . He had no chance at future Citizenship , because he was n't the son of a Citizen or an expert Gamesman himself , but he could interfere with Mach 's chance  --  for himself and his kind . " For a prize , " Mach said . " To make it worthwhile . " " What worthwhile prize could you have to offer ? You 're just a serf , like me ! " Doris smiled . " I 'll be the prize , " she said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mach began . liur Ware 's eyes were lighting . He had always had a hankering for Doris , but until this moment she had not given him any positive signal . " Good enough ! For Doris ! " he agreed . " t , an a person be a trophy ? " Agape asked , perplexed . " Why not ? " Doris asked with satisfaction . " You were ! " M.0 It wished he had the circuitry for a human sigh . He would have w put his relationship with Doris , which had been generally a good one , on the line . She was angry with him for insufficient ( misc. , but had found a way to hurt him . He would have to go through with it .  | They went to the Game Annex . They stood at opposite grid stations and touched their choices . Mach had the numbers , so selected 2 . MENTAL , to nullify the android 's advantage of temporary strength and throw it into the android 's weakness of intellect . Ware selected B. TOOL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mental games . Mach was strong here , so his prospects were brightening . The subgrid for this category differed from that for the physical games . Mach had the numbers again : 5 . SEPARATE , 6 . INTERACTIVE , 7 . PUZZLE , 8 . COOPERATIVE . Ware had the letters : E. BOARD , F. CARDS , G. PAPER , H. GENERAL . Mach chose 7 . PUZZLE , trusting that his wit was quicker than the android 's . Ware chose H. GENERAL , which broadened the range of choices . They filled in the sub-subgrid with various types of mechanical puzzles : jigsaw , matches , string , knots , cube assembly , Rubic cube and a labyrinth . When the final choices were paired , the result was the labyrinth . Well , Mach should be able to solve that faster than the android could . " Hey , did n't you run that one this morning , Ware ? " a bystander called . " Yeah , " Ware replied , satisfied . Oh-oh . The format of the labyrinth was changed on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or detail it would have  --  unless that player had experienced it on the same day . Ware had gotten a major break . Or had he made his own break , knowing that Mach preferred mental or tool-assisted games , and liked puzzles ? Had he somehow planned for this encounter ? If so , he was smarter or more determined than Mach had credited . Still , Mach had run the labyrinth many times , and was familiar with most of its variants . He might not be at as great a disadvantage as he feared . There were interactive properties that could nullify advance knowledge . They adjourned to the labyrinth chamber . This time it was set up in the form of a huge circle with three entrances . Doris was designated the Damsel in Distress , and Mach was the Rescuing Hero , and Ware was the Monster . Mach 's object was to find and rescue the Damsel before the Monster found her and dragged  | her away to his lair . If Mach could bring her out his entrance , he would be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was . The Damsel was required to go with whomever touched her first . In a double sense , Mach realized . He had kept company with her because , as a cyborg , she had the body of a robot and the mind of a human being . She had originally been human , but an accident to her body had rendered it inoperable , so her brain had been transplanted to the machine , where it was maintained in a bath of nutrients and connected to the machine 's perceptive and operating units . Such mergers had always been problematical , for no human brain could align perfectly with anything other than a human body , but as cyborgs went she had been more sensible than most . She had been given the finest of bodies , which she delighted to use for every purpose , and because she was both human and machine , she understood Mach 's ambivalence . He had one human and one machine parent ; having experienced the machine existence , he longed for the human one , the other face of his coin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her endlessly fascinating . But she did have that erratic streak , which could make her difficult to deal with at times . Evidently she was toying with the notion of having physical relations with a flesh creature , having satisfied herself about those with a nonflesh creature . Now that she was angry with him , she was using this notion to force him to respond . All because he had tried to help the alien female get adjusted . Yet Agape had been in genuine need ; what else could he have done ? A machine could have ignored her plight , but a human being would have helped , and it was the human model he preferred to emulate . They entered at their doors . The game was on . It was gloomy inside , but his vision adjusted automatically to the changed conditions . He could see well enough . The passage urved and recurved and divided . There was no way to be sure which passage would lead most directly to intersect with Doris ' door ; he would have to depend on speed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trick was not merely to find the I ) , unsel first , it was to bring her back out . If he got her , but then the Monster intercepted them , he would probably be lost , be.lust. the Monster was by definition the stronger of the two males ,  | and would win any direct encounter . This was counterbalanced by the Damsel 's established preference for the Hero ; she would try to help him find her , and would even search for him , while trying to avoid the Monster . If the Hero touched her first , she would go quietly wherever he led ; if the Monster caught her , she would go with him , but would scream all the way , making it easier for the Hero to intercept them and perhaps prevent the Monster from making his exit . Now Mach heard her screams . The Monster had caught her already ! How could it have happened so quickly ? But as he moved on , he realized that the sounds were wrong . Doris was still alone . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hero ! Hero ! " she called . " Come find me ! " The fool ! Did n't she realize that the Monster could hear her just as well as the Hero could ? Since Ware was already familiar with this variant of the maze , the advantage would be his ; he could go directly to her without false detours . Then Mach heard his rival , pounding along a nearby passage . Ware knew where he was going , certainly ! Well , there was one way to even things up : he could follow the Monster ! Mach ducked into a cul-de-sac , hiding , as the android passed , then emerged and pursued him quietly . Soon they both arrived at the Damsel 's site . As Ware closed on her , she neither screamed nor fled as she was supposed to ; she simply waited for him . Had she forgotten all the conventions of this game ? Ware slowed , approaching her . He reached out his hand to tag her , and she extended her hand to him . Something very like human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ victory to Ware ! Mach launched himself at the back of the Monster . By striking by surprise , at the moment the rival 's attention was distracted by imminent victory , he might score against him ; the Game Computer allowed for such tactics . All he had to do was touch Ware from behind " Look out ! " Doris cried . Ware , alerted , swung around to meet Mach 's charge . They collided , face to face . " Hero killed , . " the voice of the Game Computer announced .  | Thanks to Doris ' betrayal , Mach had lost the game  --  and her savor . Back in his private serf chamber , Mach pondered the ramifications . He had thought that Doris ' anger with him was a misunderstanding , spawned by his appearance with the alien female . Now he realized that he had misjudged the cyborg . She had grown tired of him , but preferred a pretext to separate . After all , if she formally broke up with him , others might conclude that she liked breaking hearts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) and be wary of her , leaving her without male company . She wits not the sort to risk that . So she had engineered it so that another male had taken her away from Mach . That left her nominally innocent . She had had her prospective companion , the android Ware , get his fellow android Narda to set Mach up with Agape , then had sought out the pair and made a scene  --  with W-re handily near . How cunning ! Then she had worked to ensure Ware 's victory , by " misplaying " her part , and finally openly betraying Mach . Thus he , Mach , had become the butt of the play . I lad he " won " her , then there would have been no onus on her , and she could have tried another ploy at another time . So he was without a girlfriend  --  and perhaps had been for longer than he had realized . What was he , after all , except a Alac hire  --  that could not even experience the grief that a human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a situation ! No tinder Doris had grown tired of him . Living creatures had genint. emotions that made them less predictable and more inter  --  tting . How he wished he could be alive ! lie lay on his bed , which he did n't really need because it was not necessary for him to sleep , and invoked his creative circuit . This was newly developed , and had been installed only a few months ago . He had taken to playing with it at odd moments , savoring the illusion of erratic thought . It had random factors inn hided , so that the same starting thought could lead to different frttnits , some of them only marginally logical . Living creatures wet ( ' c , tpable of illogic , and that was part of their appeal . Even the e yborg Doris , with her inanimate body and living brain , could lx marvelously illogical when she chose . Mach wanted that capatity fit himself , but so far had never been able to originate a truly  | illogical thought process . The circuit was only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it did not govern him . He always knew the illogic for what it was , and that prevented him from being truly alive . Now he tried a special variant . He tried to imagine himself in the mysterious frame of Phaze , where magic supposedly operated and science did not . That was so illogical that it would represent a monumental leap of belief on his part . If he could successfully believe that , he could believe almost anything  --  including the possibility of somehow coming alive . He imagined having a living brother his own age , there in Phaze . No , not a brother  --  an alternate self , who bore the same relation to him that Stile did to Citizen Blue . The same person he was , only split apart from his reality , existing in that nonreality of Phaze . It was of course nonsensical to postulate a robot having an alternate self  --  but no more so than the notion of a land of magic . How convenient that that land was forever sealed off from Proton , according to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ! What had happened , a generation ago ? Had Stile exchanged places with another Galactic called Blue , who had been raised on another planet in the galaxy ? Called it " a fantastic world " and that was how the idea of fantasy started ? But now Mach concentrated , trying to believe in the literal magic , in the living boy just like himself , with whom he might establish rapport . He tried to force the delusion on himself , to make himself irrational . If only he could believe ! Then , almost , it seemed that he achieved it . Something like a thought came to him : Who are you ? A thought he might not have originated . A living thought . I am Mach ! he thought back . Let 's exchange places ! As the android girl had done , boldly offering to change companions , and succeeding . All right for a moment , the thought came back . His imagination was achieving a new level ! It really seemed like another person thinking . Mach made a special @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strange wrenching . Alarmed , he eased off ; had he blown a circuit ? He felt quite strange . Then he opened his eyes . His room had changed .  | Room ? It was no longer a room at all ! It was a forest glade . He was sitting on a rock in its center . Mach blinked . Sometimes dust fouled his lenses and distorted his vision ; the act of blinking normally cleared it . The glade remained . Late afternoon sunlight slanted down to touch the thickly braided vines and leaves at one side , and grass grew ankle-deep in the center . None of this existed , of course , in his room . Mach got up and went to the edge , intrigued to discover how far this illusion carried . He touched a broad leaf  --  and it felt genuine . He pulled on a vine , and it resisted his effort , being springy . I lc had tried to switch places with his phantom twin  --  and found himself here . Was there really a twin , and had he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his belief in the impossible ? Surely the latter  --  but this still represented a signiIitant victory . He had achieved illogic ! Moved by the wonder of it , he walked around the edge of the  | glade . He found a path leading from it , twisting like a serpent between the large trees until it disappeared in the distance . Should he follow this ? He looked down at himself , considering  --  and made another phenomenal discovery . He was clothed ! He wore boots , trousers and a long-sleeved shirt  --  all blue . He had been so distracted by the living glade that he had not noticed his own condition ! His first reaction was shock . He was impersonating a Citizen ! That could get him ejected from the planet ! Only in very special situations , such as in costumed drama in the Game , were serfs permitted apparel . His second was wonder . How had he come by such an outfit ? Had he taken it from his father 's collection ? Citizen Blue did prefer this color . But Mach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing , and that was a state a robot was incapable of achieving . Or was it ? Was n't believing the impossible a condition of insanity ? If he could convince himself that he was in a glade instead of his room , could he likewise garb himself in his father 's clothing without realizing ? If so , this effect was dangerous ! Quickly he removed the clothing . But he discovered as he did so that it fit him perfectly . This was odd , because Mach was five centimeters taller than Citizen Blue . The Citizen was a very small man whose enormous political power more than made up for his lack of physical stature . Mach could have been any height he chose , but did not want to create any awkwardness for his father , so he had compromised by assuming his mother 's height . This put him in the low-average range for women , and well below average for men . But he had long since realized that physical height was not the most important aspect of individual importance , so he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his father 's clothing without it binding on him ? This clothing seemed to have been fitted specifically for his own body . His thoughts were interrupted by an appearance in the sky . It seemed to be a huge , grotesque bird  --  but what a bird ! Mach stared disbelievingly . He had studied birds , learning the major types , because Birdwatching was one of the events in the Game . No bird like this was listed . This one had a huge , misshapen head , and dangling breasts like those of an old woman .  | A what , and what ? Mach shook his head and looked again , but the creature had already disappeared . Ile knew what it was , however . The description fit that of a harpy  --  a mythical construct , part avian , part human . The appearance of such a creature was of course another impossibility . Even if some sinister laboratory had crafted an android in that guise , the dynamics of flight would have rendered the harpy groundbound . The necessary wingspan and muscular attachMach found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were threatening to overwhelm his equilibrium ! He was not encountering just one unbelievable thing , but a complex of them ! Trees , clothing , mythology 1 Iis heart ? He had no heart ! He was a robot ! Mach set his right palm at his chest . He felt the beating of it . I It lifted his left hand , set his right fingers against the wrist beside the large tendon and pressed in . Again he felt that steady beat . I le was breathing , too . He had always been able to breathe , so as to be able to talk , but it had been optional , never necessary , and he normally did n't bother unless in company . Now he held his breath  --  and in moments was uncomfortable , exactly as if lw ( oming starved for oxygen . I le reached under his left arm , seeking the stud that opened ? panel there . He found none . Slowly he moved his fingers to his forearm . He pinched the skin there , hard . Pain flared , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fingernail had dug into the skin . Mach had to lean against a tree to keep from reeling . He was alive ! 1-lts body was fashioned of flesh ; it had a heart , and it felt dire ( t pain . Now he knew that he had suffered a far greater breakthrough an he had anticipated . He had made his belief in the impossible tal , and stepped into the realm of the living . Of course this could not be literal , but even as a dream it was astonishing , for robots did not dream . That new circuit had really performed ! I 4 ( e had achieved what no robot had ever done before : fashioned ? tot , t ! illusion of life . But now that he had done this , what had he really accomplished ! Metallic insanity ! Was his body lying on the bed while  | his brain was locked into its own program of fantasy ? That could be fun for a while , but after a few hours he would be in trouble , because his mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the glitch . If the case were judged to be too extreme , they would reprogram his brain unit , wiping out everything he had accomplished here , including the memory of it . He would be forever after bound to his natural robotic state . That , he realized , would be disaster . He was delighted to have achieved this breakthrough . To generate even the facsimile of life , even within his dream  --  in fact , the mere fact of the dream was extraordinary . He had to preserve and improve this ability ? which meant he had to master the technique of releasing himself from it . It would be best if no one else know of this accomplishment , until he had perfected it . He concentrated , trying to release the dream . Nothing happened . He remained in the glade , his heart still beating , his breath still breathing . He did n't know how to turn off the dream . But perhaps he was n't helpless . His dream had to have limits ; if he explored beyond those limits , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the path . He did n't care where it went ; he just meant to follow it beyond the definition that it had . To force the issue . The path wound through the forest , following a contour . Parts of it were rocky , and he discovered that his feet were tender . Since he had gone barefoot for all his existence , and his soles had been of toughened pseudoflesh , this was a surprise . But it was consistent with the illusion of living flesh , especially if it was supposed to have used boots . He came to a fork in the path . Which way should he go ? One path led downward , the other upward . He felt thirsty , which was another aspect of the verisimilitude of this dream , so he took the one leading down . There might be a river there . There was indeed a stream . The water wended lazily through a swampy region . The path descended into this and disappeared . Mach considered , then got down flat and put his lips to the closest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physics that he had described to Agape .  | Agape ? How far away the alien female seemed now ! There was a sudden snort behind him . He jerked his head up , twisting about to look back . It was a man  --  with the head of a llig . The snout was flattened in the porcine manner , and cruel tusks glinted at the sides of the mouth . Mach scrambled up . The pighead stepped aggressively forward . Somehow it reminded him of Ware , the android . Now look , creature , " Mach said nervously . " I do n't want to bother you . I just want to drink . " For the mouthful he had taken to was n't enough . " Zdringk ! " the pighead snorted . " Owrs ! " i le was claiming this drinking-spot ? " Then I 'll drink farther along , " Mach said , trying to edge around the creature . " Zrriverr owrs ! " the pighead proclaimed . The whole river is yours ? But that 's unreasonable ! " The pighead lowered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he was not about to be reasonable . He reminded Mach even more strongly of the android . Mach considered again . He was thirsty , and this seemed to be the only reasonable source of water . If he gave this up , he was n't sure where or when he would find another drinking place . He would have to stand his ground . " I feel that I have about as much right to drink as you do , " he said . " Please allow me to ? " The pighead squealed with rage . Immediately there was a rusding in the vicinity , and the sound of feet striking the ground . Several other pigmen appeared  --  and several pigwomen too . All were naked and completely humanoid , the females quite attractively so , except for the heads . All looked menacing . The pigheads blocked off the path . Mach had to retreat into the water . He discovered that the path continued under the surf ; u e , firm though slippery ; he could proceed without getting dunked , as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way , but then halted , snorting angrily . Mach went on  --  and abruptly stepped off the edge and landed up to his waist in water-covered muck . He should hive watched where he was going ! There was a hiss . He looked  --  and spied a man swimming  | toward him . Relieved , but cautious , he scrambled back to the firm path , and stood knee-deep as the man came close . And the man turned out to be only the head of a man . The body was that of a monstrous python , undulating through the water . Mach had thought this was a dream . But he had never heard or read of either pigmen or snakemen , and his computer-type brain was not strong on creative imagination . If he had tried to populate this dream , he would have done it with conventional monsters . In fact , he would not have used monsters at all ; he would have made it a completely satisfactory setting , for his own delight . This did not make sense . " Ourss ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water . Beyond him , other heads appeared in the water . Mach realized why the pigheads had stopped their pursuit . Their territory ended where that of the snakefolk began . He looked back , but saw the pigheads still clustered at the edge of the swamp . He would have to proceed forward . " I 'm going ! " he said , and sloshed along the path . He had to slide his bare feet forward under the water to make sure the firm path continued , lest he get dunked again . He was n't sure what the snakes would do to him if they caught him , but did n't care to find out . Fortunately there was no pursuit . As he moved he continued to ponder . If this was not the kind of situation his robot brain would or could have created , how could he account for his dream ? The answer was that he could not . But the alternative was to assume that it was not a dream . That suggested that it was reality . Had he really been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By switching places with his twin ? Of course a physical exchange could not have occurred . But a mental one  --  that did seem plausible . His consciousness was in the body of his twin ? and his twin 's consciousness must be in Mach 's own body . Mach 's lips pursed in a soundless whistle . This thesis was reasonable  --  but what would a human person do in the body of a machine ? The path led to an island rising out of the swamp . Relieved , Mach sloshed toward it  --  and stepped off the path again , taking  | snot her messy dunking . The path curved about , as it had on land , end he had to check for it constantly . 1 e drew himself out of the muck , then proceeded to the island . It was thickly overgrown with reeds and brush and small trees , but the path was clear . This was certainly better than the water . Mach rounded a bend  --  and came across a worse monster than before . It was a man  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waved and the complicated insectoid mouth-parts quiv*red . The thing looked hungry . Mach backed away  --  but another roach-head came onto the path behind him . He was trapped . Well , not quite . He leaped into the brush to the side . Too late he discovered that it was solid brambles ; the thorns raked along his legs and torso stingingly . Yet the roach-heads were blocking the path , their ugly mandibles working . He had not been programmed to abhor roaches ; indeed , they did not exist in the natural state in the frame of Proton . But his living body evidently loathed the notion of contact with such creatures , and certainly he did n't want those mandibles chewing into his tender flesh . Trapped between unacceptable alternatives , Mach let his body ** . His head went back and he screamed . " Heeelp ! " There was a distant sound of music . Then an approaching beat . sounded as if a horse were approaching . Mach screamed again . He knew how to ride a horse ; that was r of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or even it were n't  --  if he could somehow get on it  --  but of course it s tame , for he heard the music of the rider . In a very brief time the beat became splashing . The horse was urging through the water . Maybe there was a patrol whose duty % to come to the aid of distressed travelers . Mach called again , king sure the rider could find him . Now it thundered onto the island , the music of its rider bemiing loud . It sounded as though a flute were playing , or several .1 them . The roach-heads abruptly scuttled into the brush , aprently not bothered by the brambles . " I ere ! " Mach cried . The horse came into sight . It bore no rider . It was glossy black , with golden socklike  | coloration on the two hind legs . From the forehead sprouted a long spiraled horn . This was a unicorn . Mach was beyond caring at this point . " I beg you , beautiful creature  --  carry me from here ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mare , not large for a horse , but in fit condition . Her head turned toward Mach . She sounded a double note of query . The horn was making the music ! Citizen Blue had mentioned this , long ago , but Mach had assumed this was mere embellishment of a tale told to a child . Now he realized that it was literal . His father had come from this frame , and had known unicorns . Mach pulled himself painfully from the brambles . His body was bleeding in several places . " If you will carry me ? " he repeated , afraid the mare would bolt before he could mount her . But she made an acquiescent note . He came up to her and scrambled onto her back , taking firm hold of her glossy mane . " My gratitude to you , lovely creature ! " he gasped . She started walking , then trotting , wending her way on along the narrow path with sure-footed confidence . As she moved , she played a pretty double melody on her marvelous horn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been programmed for perfect pitch and because it was a useful talent in the Game ; he knew quality when he heard it , and that horn was as good as an instrument could be . To think that a mere animal could do it so well ! There was no further sign of the roach-heads ; evidently the music warned them away . The path proceeded to the other side of the island and back into the water . The animal trod it with confidence , evidently knowing exactly where to place her hooves . The water swirled with fish , some of them large ; three vertical fins cut through the ripples toward them . The unicorn pointed her horn at the largest and blew a triple-note chord of warning ; the fin altered course immediately , approaching no closer , and the other two did likewise . Farther along a thing like a crocodile lifted its long snout , hissing . Again the unicorn blew her chord , and the thing backpedaled . Mach was impressed ; it was evident that this equine  | creature was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tonic to his rescue ! But why had she done so ? Mach remembered that his father had spoken of associating with a unicorn . Or his alternate self had done so . But he had never provided any details . " That life is past , " was all he would ever say . Mach had gathered that unit urns were not necessarily friendly to man ; apparently it had been a remarkable thing for a man to befriend one . Yet this one had come right to him , a stranger , and rescued him . The water-path was finally headed for solid land again . Here the tooting seemed to be especially intricate ; the unicorn was almost doing a four-footed dance as she stepped along it . And here it was that a more formidable menace appeared . From the deep water to the side emerged a huge and mottled reptilian head . It had two curling horns and greenish scales and widely spreading whiskers . Then the mouth opened , to reveal sii array of teeth as formidable as any Mach had known of . Jets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little clouds as they cooled and expanded . The unicorn paused . It was evident that this was a threat she did not dismiss lightly . Indeed , as the monster lifted itself higher , Mach could see why . This was a literal dragon ! The dragon leaned forward , extending two front legs with ferocious talons . Its head swung on a sinuous neck . More steam sued , forming cloudlets bathing Mach with hot vapor . Viscous r$*liva dripped from the mouth . The unicorn tilted her head so that her right eye bore directly on Mach , as if questioning him . He shrugged nervously . " If you Do n't know what to do , I certainly do n't ! " he said . He had been ! shining confidence as the animal bore him to safety ; now that confidence was rapidly draining away . He realized that the uniCorn a ould not readily back away ; the footing was so tricky that She probably had to move forward to achieve it . On land she could have fled the dragon ; here she could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horn , and appeared to be quite capable of destroying her in combat , this was a formidable threat . The unicorn made something very like a shrug ; the skin of her shoulders rippled . Then she faced the dragon and blew a new  | chord . This seemed to have about four notes , with a quaver and an especially penetrating quality ; it made a shiver run down Mach 's back . The dragon paused . Then it snorted more steam and cranked its jaws farther open . The gape of that mouth was horrendous ; Mach realized that the dragon could snap off half his body with one bite , and perhaps intended to do just that . The unicorn 's chord of warning had not dissuaded it . This monster knew it commanded the situation , and it was hungry , and it intended to feed . Mach 's living heart was beating at a fast rate , and his living breathing was becoming noisy . He was afraid  --  and this was an emotion he had never before experienced . He did not enjoy it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Again the dragon paused , the little ears below its horns swiveling to orient on that sound . Evidently the chord was a special type of signal , that did have some effect  --  but not enough to put this monster off entirely . The dragon brought its head slowly down . The big nostrils pointed at Mach like the barrels of twin rifles . The torso expanded ; evidently the dragon was taking a deep breath , getting ready to issue a blast of steam that would cook man and unicorn in place . The unicorn took her own deep breath . She set herself , pointed her horn straight up , and stretched out her neck . The hairs of her mane lifted , almost like the hackles of an angry dog . There was going to be one phenomenally loud sound ! Abruptly the dragon backed away . Its head traveled to the side and down to the water , and under the surface , and the sinuous neck and body followed . In a moment it was gone . Mach relaxed quiveringly . The mare had bluffed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feared the threatened loud sound more than the lesser sounds . The unicorn resumed her motion along the path , picking her way toward the land . While she did this , Mach pondered the matter further . Surely the louder chord could not have hurt the dragon , if the fainter ones had not . Why , then , had it retreated ? His living brain was not as straightforward about logic as his robot brain had been , but this was not a difficult process . Ob- viously the chord was not a weapon in itself , but a signal  --  a call for help . Thus a faint one served as a warning , while a loud one would be heard all over the forest and bring reinforcements . Other unicorns , perhaps . One dragon might overcome one immobilized unicorn , but suppose several unicorns came ? Yet the dragon had disappeared so swiftly and completely into the water that it was hard to see how other unicorns could have come in time to help , or how they could have located the dragon for revenge if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this did n't make complete sense . The unicorn reached land and picked up speed , resuming her trot . She resumed her melody ; evidently she liked trotting to music . Where was she taking him ? And why ? She had put herself in real jeopardy to help him ; why do this for a stranger ? His logical mind struggled to make sense of things . The path divided ; without hesitation the animal selected one fork and trotted on . The forest was thinning now , with larger glades appearing , and finally open fields . They were ascending a slope that seemed to have no end ; the unicorn 's body became warmer from the exertion , but she did not sweat . Now the land fell away on either side ; the path was mounting a ridge , perhaps a glacial moraine . It was hard to tell , because time had passed and dusk was closing ; he could not see clearly to the base of the slopes . In due course they reached a ragged t lift ; the path cut its way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sky but otherwise closed . Here at last they stopped . Mach slid off , glad to return to his own feet . He winced as he landed ; he had forgotten the abrasion his soles had incurred . Also , his scratches stung . The interest of the ride had distracted hum from such details , but now they intruded . " Well , we are evidently here , " he said . " But I do n't know why you brought me , and I do n't suppose you can explain . " The unicorn eyed him  --  and suddenly he had an ugly thought . harses grazed on grass and ate grain and hay . What did unicorns eat I le had seen enough to know that their metabolism was not at all like that of mundane equines . Had this one brought him here as prey ? The unicorn lowered her horn and stepped toward him . Ab- ruptly terrified , Mach tried to run . But there was nowhere to run to ; this was a closed region , with the unicorn blocking the only exit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no suitable handholds . He scraped his fingers against the stone in his desperate effort , incurring more scratches . He knew he was reacting foolishly , only making himself seem more like prey , but he had no automatic control over the emotion of this living body . It was no use . If he was here to be eaten , he would just have to accept it . Defeated , he slumped against the stone wall , waiting for whatever was to come . Nothing came . After a moment he turned around . The unicorn was gone . She had brought him here  --  and left him . What did that mean ? He was n't sure that he cared to guess . His palpitating bodily processes settled down somewhat . His more sensible mind reasserted itself . He explored his prison . There was a mound of soft brush and hay at one side , evidently a sleeping place . This must be the unicorn 's lair , protected from most other creatures . He was relieved to discover no bones ; if she brought victims here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considered trying to escape , but he was now so tired that he knew he would not get far . Tiredness was another new phenomenon for him , and he did n't like it . And what was there for him outside ? A jagged path , and a series of predatory monsters ! Better to remain here and get some rest , and hope that the unicorn was after all beneficent . He sat on the nest of brush . It was surprisingly comfortable . He leaned back against it . Before he knew it , he was asleep . He woke in starry darkness . Something was wrong with his abdominal circuitry . He felt bloated . Had an oil valve clogged ? He checked at a service aperture , but found none ; his fingers slid across unbroken skin . Then he remembered : he was in a living body ! That meant that he needed to release fluid , in the living manner . His robot body could eat and drink , but did not eliminate in the biological way ; it simply regurgitated the material at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perform in the fashion he had observed in human beings and androids . He got up  --  and discovered that he was not alone . His hand brushed across the torso of another living creature . The unicorn ? He peered , and made out the vague outline . Not an animal , but a man ! His hand helped define the leg , arm , breast ? It was female ! Mach withdrew . Evidently he had not awakened her , and that was probably best . How had she come here ? She must have walked up the path , arriving after he was asleep . Perhaps this was where she regularly spent the night . She had wen him , and had simply settled down beside . That seemed too simple , but it would have to do for now . He needed to find a suitable place to relieve himself . He felt about with his feet , but knew that there was no place within this enclosure . He would have to go outside . So he walked carefully in the direction he remembered the entrance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from above did help . He moved along the wall , finding the exit . A gentle breeze gusted through it , refreshingly cool . In the distance was the sound of some night bird . He established himself at the edge of the path , aimed his liquiddisposal appendage , and let go down the mountainside . It was a great relief . However , this reminded him of his thirst , which had not really been slaked at the swamp , and this now manifested with renewed force . Another problem of the living state ! He returned inside the crater . He would just have to sleep until morning , and then see what offered . Perhaps the human female would know where there was water . And food  --  he would be hungry soon . But as he came to the brush pile , he realized that the female was awake . Indeed , she was sitting up , peering at him . " 1 ? 1 was uncomfortable , " he said awkwardly . Natural functions were normally not discussed between the sexes in Proton , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bane , " she said . Her voice was pleasant , having an almost flutelike quality . " 1 do n't understand . "  | " Bane  --  is thy game over ? " she asked . " Game ? " She sighed . " Not over . Then I will play it on with thee . Do thou kiss me , and we shall sleep . " " Kiss ? " he asked , perplexed . She stood , rising lithely to her feet . She approached him , reached up , took hold of his head with both her hands , and brought her face to his . She kissed him on the mouth . " Long has it been since we played thus , " she said . " Come , now ; sleep . " She tugged him toward the nest . Mach followed , bemused . This girl seemed to know him , and she wanted to sleep . There were several meanings for that word , and he was not sure which one applied , so he simply lay down in the fragrant brush beside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intended sexual expression , he could do that ; as a robot he had the hardware , and was programmed to  --  but no , he was n't a robot anymore ! Still , as a living man he had similar capacities , and she seemed to be an attractive girl ; he could do whatever seemed to be called for . She squeezed his hand , turned her head to the side , and slept . In a moment her gentle breathing signaled her condition . Relieved , Mach did the same . He wondered whether she would still be there when morning came . As it happened , she was . He woke to the pressure of her little hand , tousling his hair . " Wake , Bane ! " she exclaimed . " What is the game today ? Naked through the swamp again ? " That made him realize that though he was properly naked , she was not . She wore a black cloak that covered her body from neck to ankle . He remembered , now , that he had felt cloth about her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cover , not clothing . Now he had to ascertain the situation . He had three alternatives . First , she might be in costume , considering this to be a play ; indeed she had mentioned a game . Second , she might be a serf masquerading as a Citizen . That was of course dangerous . Third , she might actually be a Citizen . He had to know . A Citizen always had to be addressed with the proper forms of respect . But a serf in Citizen garb had to he set straight immediately , before real trouble came of it .  | " Sir , I must know , " he said , erring on the safe side . " What is your status ? " She looked at him , her green eyes seeming to twinkle . " Sir ' ? What speech be this , Bane ? " So she was not a Citizen . Just as well ! " Then you are a serf ? " " Serf ? Bane , if thou willst but tell me thy game , I will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rules of it . " " What is this thee ' business ? " he asked . She smiled . Her black hair framed her face , and she wore a pearl at her forehead ; she was lovely in her joy . " A game of language ! " she exclaimed , clapping her hands . " No game . I just do n't understand . Who are you ? Where did you come from ? Why do you use the archaic forms ? Why are you garbed ? " She cocked her head at him cannily . " So we call it not a game . That can I do . As for who I be , as if thou dost not know : I am Pieta , thy companion of yore . I speak as thy kind does ; wouldst nu her have me neigh ? As for my garb  --  why there be no need for it , if this be the game ! " And she reached down , caught hold ? f the hem of her cloak , and drew it up over her head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for she wore no underlothing . " Be that better , Bane ? " " Yes , " he agreed . She was a most comely figure of a young ( ) man , perfectly formed and standing just slightly shorter than r . " But why are you calling me Bane ? Do you know me ? " " What wouldst thou be called , then ? " she inquired merrily . " My name is Mach . " She laughed . " What a stupid name ! " I lc frowned . " Is Fleta a more intelligent name ? " " ( , ertainly ! But I will try to keep my laughter down while I all thee Mach . " Indeed , she did try , but the laughter bubbled p from her stomach , caused her breasts to bounce , and finally rst out of her mouth . She flung her arms about him and kissed im , as she had in the night . " 0 , Bane  --  I mean Ma-Ma ? " A atgglc overcame her , but she fought through it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I feared thou hadst forgotten me in thy serious studies of blue magic ; how glad I be to learn not ! " " Het a , I have to say that I do not know you . What 's this about  | " Ah , wait till I tell the fillies of the herd of this ! Never played we music like this ! " " If you would just answer my questions , " Mach said somewhat stiffly . " As thou dost wish , " she agreed . " But first may we eat ? and 0 , I see thou art all scratched ! Why dost thou not heal thyself ? " " Heal myself ? " he asked blankly . " I think only time can do that . " " With thy magic , " she explained . " Surely the game be not such that thou must suffer such smarts ! " " I do n't know anything about magic ! " he protested . She made a moue . " Or wouldst thou have the unicorn heal thee instead ? " " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you know about that ? " She stared at him , then smiled again , dismissing his supposed ignorance . " Thy memory seems brief , lately ! " " A unicorn brought me here last night , after rescuing me from monsters in the swamp . I do n't know why ; do you ? " She shook her head so that the lustrous hair swirled . " Who can know the mind of a ' corn ! " she exclaimed , laughing again . " Mayhap she thought thou didst call for help . " " I did call for help , " he agreed . " But  --  but why should an animal do me any favor ? " " An animal , " Fleta repeated thoughtfully . " An thou hadst called her that , mayhap she 'd have left thee in the swamp indeed ! " " Oh  --  are they sensitive about that sort of thing ? Good thing she did n't understand my speech . " " Aye , so , " she agreed , twinkling again . " So thou dost not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her horn ? " " With her horn ? " " Adepts be not the only ones who do magic ! " she exclaimed . " Dost thou not remember the healing of the horn ? " " You mean  --  that unicorn  --  when she approached me with her horn lowered  --  only wanted to  --  to touch my scratches and heal them magically ? " " Lo , now he remembers ! " she exclaimed . " What else would she be about ? "  | " 1 was n't sure , " he confessed . " I was relieved when she left . " Fleta frowned . " There be aspects of this game I understand not , " she said . " Thou dost not wish the return of the unicorn ? " " True , " he agreed . " But of course I can not prevent it . Maybe we should get away from here before she arrives . " She sighed . " Be that the way thou dost want it , so let it be . I had not thought to hear thee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm sure unicorns can be perfectly good animals , and I do appreciate what she did for me yesterday . But I must admit I feel safer with you . " " And thou dost not propose to conjure up a repast for us both ? " " What makes you think I could do such a thing ? " She laughed her merry laugh . " Sheer foolishness , Mach ! " she said . " Come , I shall find us food . " She led him from the crater.  | Bane found himself in a chamber , sitting on a bed . A moment before he had been in the forest glade , seeking rapport with his other self . He had sung a spell to facilitate the exchange of identities  --  and it seemed that it had worked ! Here he was in the other frame , while his alternate had to be in Phaze . Wait till he told his father of this success ! He looked about , trying to fix as much of this locale in his mind as possible before he reverted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stile would doubt him , but that he wanted to have information that would establish the case beyond question . This was the first genuine contact with the frame of Proton since the two had separated twenty years ago . Of course no one else had seriously sought such contact ; it had been generally agreed that total separation of the frames was best . But Bane had regarded it as a challenge , and when he had tuned in on the sendings of his other self , he had jumped at the chance to intensify the contact . This was definitely Proton ! Everything about the room was  | unmagical . The bed was formed of some substance unknown in ! ' haze , hard like wood but with no grain , and the mattress on it was like one big white sponge . There was a cabinet against the wall with a window in it that opened on blankness . Beside it were several books  --  no , they seemed to have no pages . But perhaps the folk of this frame did n't read books . His father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was naked . That , too , aligned ; Stile had mentioned that the folk of Proton went naked , all except the rulers . He was really here , in the body of his other self . But he decided to make sure . If this were Proton , magic would not work here . " Make me rise , to realize , " he sang , composing a ditty on the spot , as he had been trained to do from childhood . It was his mind that really governed the spell , but it had to be in the right form : singsong and rhymed . Nothing happened . He remained firmly planted on the bed . I n Phaze he would now be floating above it . This was the final proof : he was definitely out of Phaze . He clapped his hands , expressing the sheer joy of the accomplishment . What a breakthrough ! To transport himself to the other frame , when others had believed it to be impossible . And he would be able to do it again , now that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! But now he had better switch back , so they could each report their accomplishment to their folks . Bane sat on the bed , concentrated  --  and nothing happened . Oops ! He had used magic to facilitate the exchange  --  but here magic did n't work . His other self would have to perform the spell  --  and would his other self know the spell ? Well , he could explain . All he needed to do was use their rapport to make it clear . He concentrated again  --  and discovered , to his horror , that the rapport was gone . The two selves had to occupy the same site in their respective frames , for the rapport to be achieved . They had to unify in their fashion , seeming almost as one . It had taken Bane a long time to discover the place where he could overlap his Proton self , and to he there when his other self was ready for that rapport . This  | was that occasion  --  but now the other self had moved off the spot . Bane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He knew he could sense the other if he overlapped , or even if he came close  --  but where was the other ? He moved around the room , seeking that intangible spoor , the otherframe presence of the other self . There was no sign of it . He needed to cast a wider net , but the room restrained him . Where was the door ? There seemed to be none . Baffled , he studied the walls . Finally he decided that the one blank section he saw had to be it . There was no knob , no evidence of any aperture , but this was the strange scientific frame , so there could be another mechanism . He walked toward it , putting out his hand as if to push a door open . It worked . The wall before him fogged and disappeared . He stepped out into a metallic hall . Naked  --  outside the room ? He did n't trust this ! He turned to go back into the room  --  but the wall behind him was now opaque and unbroken . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fog . He pushed against it , and it remained firm . It seemed that some other technique was required to enter , similar to a spell that limited access to only those folk who had the counterspell . A scientific spell ? and he did n't have it . A person rounded a corner and came toward him . It was a woman  --  naked ! Now what was he to do ? He fought to control himself , and found it much easier than he had anticipated . It seemed that folk really did go naked in Proton , male and female . So he should be all right . All he had to do was act natural . The young woman approached him . " Hi , Mach ! " she said brightly . " Looking for a game ? " A game . What did she mean ? She was a voluptuous creature , as well formed as any he had seen , though of course he had not seen many naked before . Was it safe to say no ? She evidently expected him to agree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was done , he could resume his quest for his other self , who had to be somewhere close . " A game  --  yes , " he agreed . He remembered the games he had  | played as a child with Fleta . Some of them had become pretty intimate ; it embarrassed him to remember , now . Fleta had a nonhuman sense of humor , of course . " Well , then , let 's go ! " she agreed . " I 'm going to take you this time , Mach ! " Mach . That was evidently his other self 's name . That was helpful to know . But who was this attractive girl ? She seemed to be his own age , nineteen , but that could be deceptive . Well , perhaps he would find out . They walked down the hall . Bane followed her lead , hoping that his own ignorance did n't show . He also tried to note the route they took , so he could return to the original spot . He was good at that sort of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ huge building like this . Was there no end to it ? Where was the forest ? They threaded a virtual labyrinth , arriving at last at a strange complex . The girl took a stance before a kind of pedestal with a blank window set into it . She glanced at Bane . " Well , get on over there , Mach , " she said . " You scared to play me ? " He went to the other side of the pedestal , where a similar window was set . But he did not know what was expected of him next . The window lighted . A crosshatch of lines appeared . Across the top was written a combination of numbers and words , and down the side were letters and words . The top ones were brighter : 1 . PHYSICAL , 2 . MENTAL , 3 . CHANCE , 4 . ARTS . " What 's keeping you ? " the girl demanded . Bane did n't want to admit that he had no idea what to do , because obviously his other self understood this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fact that he was not Mach . " Why ( lost thou not make a suggestion ? " he inquired . She smiled . " Oho ! The fish is eager ! Well , I 'll be direct , Mach . The news is fresh that the cyborg dumped you , so I figure maybe you 'll fare better with your own kind . I do n't want to beat you , 1 want to win you . If you 've got any interest , give me the physical . You wo n't regret it . " 11er words were indecipherable , but her manner suggested Intimacy . This girl wanted romance ! Bane did n't want to get his  | other self into anything he might regret upon his return , but feared that turning down this offer could be awkward . " Just tell me what to do . . " Touch the one , lover . " Bane realized that she referred to the print . He brought his finger to the lighted number 1 and pressed it . Abruptly the first square of the pattern became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was like the paper game , that his father had shown him , wherein one person chose from one border , and the other from the other , and where their choices intersected was the decision . The challenge was to outguess the opponent , so that what he thought would bring him success actually brought him defeat . But what did PHYSICAL/NAKED mean ? The girl 's attitude suggested one thing , but since they were already naked , he hesitated to assume too much . The square expanded to fill the window . A new crosshatch appeared , and new numbers and words . Across the top was written 5 . SEPARATE , 6 . INTERACTIVE , 7 . COMBAT , 8 . COOPERATIVE , and down the left side , more brightly , E. EARTH , F. FIRE , G. GAS , H. H2O . He recognized the four elements , earth , fire , air and water , which were fundamental to the various types of magic . Of course there was another element , more im-portant " Come on , Mach , " the girl urged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lighted word at random : GAS . A new square illuminated , on the line he had selected , and in the second column . INTERACTIVE/GAS . He was n't sure he liked the notion . Then a smaller pattern of nine squares appeared , with a list of words down the side : PILLOW-FIGHTING , SEX , TAG , TRAPEZE .. . " You know what Tilly wants ! " the girl said . In the center square appeared the word SEX . " Make your pick , Macho ! " Uncertainly , he touched the word PILLOW . Immediately it brightened . Then , catching on , he touched a corner square , and the word jumped into it . Who said there was no magic in the science frame !  | Tilly put SEX into another corner . So it went , with Bane selecting a variety of terms , she only one . Then they touched their lighted sides , and the chosen square appeared : PILLOWFIGHTING . " Oh , damn ! " Tilly swore . " You cheated ! " " I thought I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . 1 ie had picked randomly again , but was just as glad it had n't finished with the word she so evidently desired . It was not that she was unattractive , but surely such a thing was no game between strangers ! " You surprised me , " she agreed . She smiled . " You surprised me when you even agreed to play ! You never gave me a tumble before , you know . " Then she cocked her head at him . " Thee ? " Bane realized that he had made an error of language . The girl had consistently used " you . " That was evidently the way they spoke , here . In perpetual plural . He smiled . " See ? Surprised you again . " She pursed her lips . " You are different today ! Doris must have made you flip out . " She had mentioned that he had been " dumped " by a " cyborg . " Was that a description of another person ? If so , it must be Doris . So he  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ separation . And Tilly was eager to step in to take Doris ' place . Assuming he had interpreted the signals correctly . But how did this game of patterns of words relate ? " Well , come on , robot , " she said . " You want pillows , I 'll give you pillows ! I 'll knock you into the muck ! " She led the way to another chamber . Bane followed , glad to let her maintain the initiative . He believed he knew what pillowltghting was ; it was a favorite game in Phaze . He had played many physical and mental games , and become quite good at several , uic lulling this one . Ile was correct . This chamber was a huge muddy pit , with a heavy pole crossing it from side to side . A walkway around the edge provided access to the far side of the pole . A number of solid pillows were suspended from hooks near the entrance . They each took a pillow . Bane made his way to the far side  | of the pole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same from her side . How serious was this supposed to be ? Tilly was about his own size , as he was small for a male , but she massed less because of the difference in proportions . He surely could knock her off the pole if he wanted to . But why dump a lovely young woman into the mud ? He would have to take his cue from her , again . They worked their way toward each other until they met in the center . Tilly grinned . " Dump or get dumped ! " she exclaimed , and swung her pillow at him in a great circle . Bane ducked his head , and her pillow passed over his head . Such a miss could cause a person to overbalance and fall untouched , but she was experienced ; she simply continued her swing in a full circle and came at him again , bopping him soundly on the shoulder . Her proficiency caught him by surprise . Bane started to fall . To restore his balance , he had to swing his own pillow hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a loud and harmless smack . But already she was swinging again , aiming for his face  --  and when he ducked , she brought her pillow down to score anyway . This was fun ! Apparently it was to be a real fight ; she wanted to bop and be bopped . He whipped his pillow about in a confined arc , scoring on her bosom . " So that 's the way you want it ! " she cried gleefully . " Take that , machine ! " And she whammed him on his own chest . The contest turned out to be about even . Tilly was good at this , and kept her balance , and had surprising endurance for a woman ; she did not seem to be tiring at all . Neither was he ; in fact he was n't even breathing hard . Breathing hard ? He was n't breathing at all ! He had been taking breaths only when he talked . Stunned , Bane forgot where he was . Tilly caught him with a powerful whomp , and he lost his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ below , chagrined . But almost without pause , she dropped too . " I beat you , robot ! " she cried , and smacked him on the ear with a handful of mud . " Hey ! " he protested . He scooped up some mud himself and dropped it on her fair hair .  | " Oh , yeah ? " she exclaimed with zest . " Take that ! " She flung herself upon him , bearing him back into the muck , her body literally plastered against his . Their heads sank under the surface , lint it seemed to make no difference ; he felt no suffocation and lus eyes did not smart . I le tried to extricate himself , but she held him tight , her face rubbing against his . There was mud on her mouth , but that did n't top her ; she jammed her lips against his for a kiss . Bane would have found all this far more intriguing if he had tt been distracted by his discovery . How could he not be breath , yet feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , react ! " Tilly said in his ear . " Invoke your passion rt uit , and we 'll do it right here ! " Passion circuit ? She referred to him as if he were some kind inanimate thing like the pedestal with the magic windows . hat was it called ? A machine . A machine ? She had called him that , and " robot . " Vaguely he membered : a robot was a walking machine . His mother had rationed one she had encountered that looked and acted extly like a living woman , with a suggestive name , Sheen . Sheen , e Rine . But a good person , his mother had said . Tilly wrapped her legs around him , hauling him in so close at the mud squeezed out between them . " Come on , make with self-will ! Mine 's all the way on ! What 's that cyborg got that have n't got ? " Sheen machine . Mach machine . Circuits . Unbreathing . Tilly stt't breathing either , except when she talked . " We 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It took you nineteen years to catch on to that ? " she asked , ding against him . " But we can do it just as well as the live ones ! Let 's prove it ! " Banc was rescued from his predicament by a new voice . " Playrs vat ate the chamber , " it boomed . " New contestants entering . " ) It , plop ! " Tilly said , hurling a mudball out . " Why could n't au have hurried , Mach ? " ' 1'iiey e limbed out , and made their way to the shower at the tie , where the mud was quickly rinsed away . Then they returned h the lull .  | " Let 's go to my chamber , " Bane said , before she could come up with something worse . She ran her hand caressingly across his shoulder . " Oho ! So that 's why you held off ! " They walked back . Tilly knew the way , which was just as well , because Bane had lost track . Soon they stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Well , say your code , " she urged him . A code . Something he must utter , like a spell , to make the wall become porous ? He had no idea what word was required . " I  --  I seem to have forgotten , " he said . " Forgotten ! " she cried , laughing . " As if a computer could ever forget anything by accident ! " Then she sobered . " But you 'll not get out of it that readily , Mach . We 'll use my chamber . " " Your chamber , " he agreed numbly . So machines did not forget . How long could he maintain this charade ? She led him to her chamber , nearby . She spoke a word , and the wall fogged . They passed through . Her room was very much like his , small and almost devoid of decoration . Machines , it seemed , did not require many human artifacts . " How would you like it ? " Tilly inquired . " We 're private here ; no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand . Bane decided it would be better to tell her the truth . " I must explain  --  I 'm not what you take me for , " he said . " Not through with Doris ? " she asked . " Look , Mach , she 's so hot with that android now , you 'd better write her off . She 's never coming back to you . What 's a cyborg , anyway , but a pickled human brain stuck in a robot body ? I never did see what you saw in her . You 're a robot , Mach ! And not just any robot . You 're going to be a Citizen one year . " A human brain in a robot body ? That sounded grotesque ! " It 's not  --  not Doris . I do n't even remember her . It 's  --  I 'm not Mach . And I think I need help . " She eyed him . " This is a private game , right ? What are you up to ? " " I 'm from another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? "  | " Another frame , " she repeated . " What do you claim you are ? " " A human being . Alive . Only now I 'm caught in ? " " So you want to pretend you 're not a machine , " she said . " That 's not a good game . It has n't been that long , historically , since we self-willed machines were granted the status of serfs . The Citizens would love to take it away from us . All they need is a pretext . You know that . So find some other game ; this one 's dangerous . " " This is no game ! " Bane protested . " I 'm from Phaze , the frame of magic , but ? " " All right , so you wo n't get serious , " she said , pouting . " So let me show you something . " " Show me ? " She brought her left hand to her face . She put her little finger between her teeth and bit down on it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small hole in it . She worked at the wound , biting deeper . There was no blood . " There , " she said after a moment , surveying the damaged finger . " I reached the nerve-wire . Now give me yours . " " Mine ? " She reached out and caught his left hand , and brought it to her mouth . Bane did not resist . He watched while she put his own little finger to her mouth , and bit into it . He felt no pain , though soon the substance of his finger was torn open . It seemed to be padding , and deeper inside , a wire . Exactly like hers . he was , indeed , a machine . Rather , his other self , Mach , was . A nonliving robot in human form . That much Tilly had demonstrated beyond question . " Now I 'll show you how to bypass the clumsy human sexual process , " Tilly said . " We robots have something much better . " She held his left hand with her right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She touched her chewed little finger to his , pushing them together so that their central wires touched . Suddenly Bane was transported by a pleasure so wild and strong as to be unutterable . It originated in his finger , but was so potent that it spread immediately throughout his body . It was indeed like sexual fulfillment , but more intense , and it kept on and on , never diminishing . He realized that Tilly , too , was ex- periencing it . Her face was fixed in an expression of rapture . Then the conta t slipped , and the pleasure faded . Now Bane felt depleted . He sat heavily on the bed . " See ? " Tilly asked . " It continues as long as contact is kept , as long as our energy sustains it . Living people can experience it only for a few seconds , but we have no such limit . " " No such limit , " Bane agreed , staring at his torn finger . This was illicit pleasure , surely  --  but what potency it had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't really a robot , " she said . He realized that she was unable to believe his story . She was a machine , subject to the limitations of that state . Her imagination simply was insufficient . Yet the truth was the truth . And he still had to locate his other self , so as to be able to change back . He certainly did n't want to be trapped forever in this frame , where machines made love by touching torn fingers ! " We 've recharged some , " she said . " Let 's do some more time . " She extended her little finger . For a moment Bane was tempted . The pleasure was indeed compelling ! But he realized that if he allowed himself to be caught up in that again , he might never want to resume his search for his other self , and that would not be right . He exercised what discipline he could muster . " No . I have another job to do . " " You mean I wrecked my finger , and I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you 're not even going to let me get full measure from it ? " she demanded . " It  --  it 's an illicit pleasure , " he said . " We  --  we 're supposed to do it in the human fashion . " Suddenly she was alarmed . " You are n't going to tell ! " Telling  --  about the illicit act . That would surely bring trouble to them both , and further complicate his effort . " No . I just ? just do n't want to do it anymore . " " Then get out of here ! " she cried angrily . " I never want to sec you again ! " he walked to the wall . It fogged , needing no spell from this side , and he stepped into the hall . So at last he was free of the robot woman . That was a mixed  | tisfaction ; she was very pretty , and she had shown him a lot at he needed to know , about the Game and the premises . And hysical pleasure such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ st that he stay away from her ; he knew that . She was not , in is idiom , a nice girl . Rather , a nice machine . , She would get in trouble , if not today , some future day . But what was he to do now ? He still hardly knew his way around these premises , and it was evident that his other self was long gone from this region , and now he had an injured finger that would be difficult to explain . i lc needed help . But where was he to find it ? Disconsolately , he walked down the hall . Other naked young Ik passed him , and he acknowledged their greetings , but kept his left hand curled into a fist to conceal the finger . Obviously he was n't going to locate his other self by aimless wandering . He had to get smart about his search . He had to figure out where he was in relation to Phaze , knowing that the geographies of the two frames were identical , and where Mach would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough , surely ; he could step outside and study the landscape . He knew the features of his world , and could normally locate his position by a simple survey of the horizon . But where was outside ? This building seemed endless ! 1 le set about it methodically : finding his way out . If he went n any single direction far enough , he had to come to the edge of the building . Then he would follow that edge until he found en exit . It was like locating water in the wilderness : keep going down , and sooner or later water would appear , for it also sought the lowest regions . But when he tried , he discovered that the halls did not go in single directions . They curved this way and that , and made right ' angle turns , and took magically moving stairs to upper floors , and magically descending chambers to nether regions . It was like one huge labyrinth that threatened to get him hopelessly lost before he really got started . In the wilderness he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ battled . I le would have to inquire . But the others thought he was  | Mach , who should know the way out ; to ask would only get laughter , or perhaps some interaction like that with Tilly , the opportunist female machine . Better to avoid that . So he continued to walk the halls , his frustration mounting . The others he passed glanced at him with increasing perplexity , but did not interfere . Then a young woman approached . She had flowing red hair , very full breasts , and a kind of rippling walk that forced him to avert his eyes lest he suffer an embarrassing reaction . He hoped she would not try to talk with him . " Oh , Mach ! " she cried . " They said you were here ! Please , if I may conversationally merge ? " He was stuck for it . Bane faced her . The pupils of her eyes were so dark they were like the water of deep wells . " Of course , " he said guardedly . She took a breath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between his teeth and bit down , trying to distract himself by the controlled pain  --  but there was no pain , just a kind of electrical tingle of warning . He locked his eyes on her face , trying to tune out the peripheral vision . " I felt it needful to express my sorrow , " she said , bringing her beautiful face close . Her complexion was so clear it almost shone . " I did not mean to be the agent of your loss of woman . " Loss of woman ? That must refer to the way Mach had gotten dumped by the cyborg . Maybe he could learn something useful . " I really remember not . " " But it was only this noon ! " she protested . " We met in the pool , and Narda exchanged companions , taking Rory while you had to take me . Then Doris caught you together with me , and made a dramatic exclamation , and Ware came to her aid , and you lost her , and it was all because of me ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but this did help clarify things . Tilly the robot had told him he had been dumped by Doris the cyborg , who had gone to an android male . Apparently it had been because of a misunderstanding involving this female . An easy misunderstanding to have , considering her appearance ! And this one was apologetic . Maybe she could help him . " I bear thee no malice , " he said carefully , still keeping his eyes  | lear of dangerous territory . If only she had some clothing on ! I know it was an  --  an accident . I  --  I misremember thy name . " " Agape , " she said quickly . " I chose it because it means instant ? ve , such as I feel for this society , that lets me participate though am an alien . Perhaps I should have chosen more carefully , but was so eager " It 's a perfect name , " he said , looking down the hall . " Thou t  --  alien ? From  --  elsewhere ? " " You know I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imbibe ! nd you did not wince ! I am so grateful ! I arrived only yesterday , d you helped me so much ! And then I hurt you so much , ithout ever knowing ! I wish there could be some recompense could offer , but ? " She spread her arms in a helpless gesre that attracted his gaze before he could stop it . He turned uy . " As it happens , there is , " Bane said , realizing his opportunity . If thou couldst show me the way outside . " " Outside ? But that is unlivable ! " " I be a machine . Methinks I can survive it . " She smiled . " That must be so . Mach , I do not know the way , t surely I can find it . We have but to inquire of a maintenance it . " Maintenance unit ? " She glanced at him with the same perplexity the others had . by do you act as if you do not know ? And why do you avert ? ur gaze @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beuse of what you saw at noon ? " I k had tried to tell the truth to Tilly , and had made no heady . I le decided to try again . " Agape , I must tell thee something ou mayst believe not . " " I will believe ! " she exclaimed . " I he not Mach . I be his other self , a living person using his dy . I he called Bane . " " You are not making humor ? " she inquired . " I am not supvied to laugh ? ? " No humor . No laugh , " he agreed . " ' Then this is the reason you can not find your way around these ' mimes , " she said . You arc totally new here ! "  | " That be it exactly . " Just as I was yesterday . " " So does it seem . " " But why do n't you look at me ? " Time for more honesty . " I be accustomed not to seeing women without clothing . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked , amazed . " Thou art an extremely , uh , attractive creature . " " Oh , what delight ! " she exclaimed . " I never imagined ! But I confess I do not know exactly how your species manifests this type of interaction . " Bane started walking , wishing that he could get away from this subject . Agape came right along with him . " I be sure I know not how thy species does , either , " he said . " But if thou canst help me get outside ? " " Oh , yes ! " she said enthusiastically . " Let me inquire of a me nial ! " She crossed to a panel set into the wall , and touched a button . " Please , some directions ? " " Aid required ? " a voice came . " We wish to find the outside . " " Follow the mouse . " A small panel slid aside at the level of the floor , and a thing very like a mouse emerged . But instead of legs it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had an upward spike . It zipped down the hall . They followed . The mouse careened around a corner , then moved to a blank section of wall . Its spike emitted a beeping sound . " This must be it , " Agape said . She touched the wall with her hand , and it fogged . They stepped through it , into a chamber containing bulky suits suspended on frames . A large wheeled object approached them . " Serfs wish egress ? " Its voice came from a grille on top . " Wish to go outside , " Agape said . " Is this permissible ? " " Permissible , " the machine agreed . " The robot can go as is , the android must don protective gear . " " Oh , he is not really a robot , and I am not an android , " Agape said .  | The machine considered . " What definitions are applicable ? " " ( ; all me robot , " Bane said quickly . " I be the only one who reds to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face seeming to melt a little . You do not wish my company ? I had understood that you found e attractive . " There seemed to be another misunderstanding here ! " Thou ost wish to come outside ? " " I wish to help you , as you in your other guise helped me. nil if you continue to find me attractive , I wish to do with you hat the females of your species do with the males . " Bane paused . It was evident that the mores of Proton differed tnewhat from those of Phaze . But the fact remained that he cded help , and that she was willing to provide it , and he liked r company more than he thought was appropriate , considering at his other self might not feel similarly . If he found Mach , and hanged places , and Agape tried to be too friendly with the ' hot .. . " I he trying to return to my frame , " he said . " When I do that , will be Mach in this body again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She nodded . " I have no knowledge either . I thank you for ur caution , Bane . But while you are here , I would like to be Ith you , because I understand how you must feel . You are an len in this world , as I am , even though you look normal for ur species . " Fairly spoken ! " Then don some gear and come along ! " he said . -1 shall be glad to have thy company awhile longer . " The menial machine selected a suit for her , and soon Agape as ready . Then they stepped into a tiny chamber she called a In ( k " and the door closed on them . In a moment , Bane knew , other door would open , and he would finally see the outside .  | At the foot of the mountain Fleta showed the way to a tree that bore huge and delicious-looking apples . Eagerly , Mach reached for one , but she put her hand on his arm , cautioning him . " That be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Joke ? I 'm hungry ! " " Bane , that apple be poison ! Mayhap thou dost mean to denature it before thou dost eat , but this be not humor I abide . " Mach paused . " Mach , not Bane . I ca n't denature anything , I told you ! " " Mach , " she repeated , again stifling her mirth . Then she sobered . " But tease me not further ; take of the good fruit . " Mach reached for a different apple , and glanced at her ; when she nodded , he plucked it . " You promised to tell me why you think I could heal myself or conjure food . " She plucked an apple of her own , and nibbled at it delicately while she spoke . " We have known each other since I was a foal and thou a baby , " she said . " Thy father , Stile , and my dam , Neysa , be oath-friends , and so she raised me near the Blue Demesnes , and I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrestled  | together when little , and later I carried thee all around Phaze . Only these past three years , when we became grown and thou studied the magic and I the antimagic of my kind , have we been is parate , and though it had to be , I missed thee , Bane . Now for moment we romp again , and ne'er would I have it end . " She had a funny way of referring to herself ! " But what about chic ? " " " l'hou'rt the son of the Blue Adept ! " she exclaimed . " One day nu willst be lord of the Blue Demesnes thyself . That be why ou hast been studying thy magic . Already thou canst do conration no ordinary person can match . Hard be it for me to derstand why thou didst not summon a sword and stab those at h-heads , or transform them to slugs . " Mach stared at her . " You 're serious ! You think I can do magic ! " " Bane , I have seen thee do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hen we were little , thou wouldst tease me with thy conjurations , t always I forgave thee . My dam likes magic not , but I have aversion to it , for how could I love thee and not thy nature ? " Mach shook his head . " Fleta , you must understand this : I am $ Bane . I ca n't do magic . The first time I met you was last right . " ' " Thou certainly dost look like Bane , and sound like him , except r thy funny affectation of speech , and smell like him , " she said . Ise would I not have come to thee . " " I 'm in Bane 's body . But I 'm from the other frame . My name Mach , and science is all I have known . " " If thou wouldst have me believe thee , let me touch thee , " c ? said . ' " Pouch me ? " She came to him , and took his hand , and brought it to her re head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Speak , " r said . " 1 , urn Mach , from Proton , " he said firmly . " I exchanged bodies tth my other self in Phaze , with Bane . Now I am here and he there , and I 'd like to change back . " She lifted his hand away from her head and brought it down lore her , staring at him over it . " Truth ! " she exclaimed , widefyrd . No joke ! " . " No joke , " lie agreed .  | " Thou'rt not the man I know ! " " I am not . " She dropped his hand and backed away . " And I spent the night with thee ! " she said , appalled . He had to smile . " Nothing happened , Fleta . " " And I kissed thee ! " she continued . " Oh , had I known ! " " And a nice kiss it was , too , " he agreed . " And now I stand naked before thee ! " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Not for grown folk ! " she said . In a moment she had gotten back into her robe . " But you 're no Citizen ! " Mach said . " If anyone catches you in that ? " " This be not Proton ! " she snapped . He had to smile . " Touche ! No Citizens here . " " No science here . " She squinted at him as if trying to penetrate his disguise . " But if thou really canst not do magic ? " " I really can not , " he agreed . " Then there be hazard here , " she concluded . " Best if I change form and carry thee back to the Blue Demesnes before any learn ! " " Change form ? " he asked . " What are you talking about ? " She hesitated . " Ah , now I remember ! Thou dost not like ? Oh , what must I do ? " Mach spread his hands . " I do n't know why you 're so upset . Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are , and maybe there I can learn how to return to Proton . Then you 'll have your friend Bane again . " She still seemed doubtful . " Bane  --  Mach , this be no garden within thy demesnes ! Here there be monsters , and as we be ? we can not travel through the fell swamp . " Mach remembered the swamp . He realized what she meant . If it had not been for the unicorn , he would have been lost . That unicorn ! What had been its intent  --  and where had it gone ? What would it do when it returned and found him gone ? " Is there any other route ? One that does n't go through the swamp ? " " None we would care to take , " she said . " Worse than the swamp ? " She nodded soberly .  | " But how did you get here , last night ? " " Thou really dost not know ! " she said , as if verifying something she could n't quite believe . " All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woke , you were beside me . You must have had some safe route . " " Not one I care to use at the moment . " " I do n't understand . " " Surely thou dost not , " she agreed . " But mayhap we have another way . " " Another path ? " " Another way . Thou must use thy magic . " " But I told you , I have no magic ! " " How dost thou know ? " " I come from a scientific frame . I do n't even believe in magic ! " " Well , I do n't believe in thy science , " she retorted . " But if I were in thy land , I would at least try thy way . " Mach realized that there was some justice in her position . " Very well , tell me how to do magic . We 'll see what happens . " " Always before , thou hast sung a ditty . " " Sung a ditty ? " he asked incredulously . " A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is ridiculous ! " " Thou didst promise to try , " she reminded him , pouting . So he had . " What ditty do you want me to sing ? " She shrugged . " Try some simple spell , first . " " No spell is simple , to my way of thinking ! " " Conjure a sword , mayhap . That can slay a monster . " " A sword . " Now Mach shrugged . " I just make a rhyme , and sing it ? " " About what thou dost want . " Mach 's experience in the Game on Proton had made him apt at quick challenges . He could sing well , and he could write poetry , inn lading nonsense verse . That last was an achievement he was proud of , for no other robot he knew of could do it . In a moment he had fashioned some doggerel verse : " I 'll be bored , without a sword , " he said . Nothing happened . " Nay , thou must sing it , " Fleta @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make a picture of it rn thy mind. , "  | Mach pictured an immense broadsword . " I 'll be bored , without a sword ! " he sang . There was a puff of smoke and an acrid smell . Something was in his hand . As the air cleared , he looked at it . It was a toy sword . " Dost thou still mock me ? " Fleta demanded . " What canst thou fight with that ? " But Mach was amazed . " I conjured it ! " he said . " I actually did conjure it ! " " Of course thou didst conjure it ! " Fleta agreed acidly , stamping a foot in rather cute frustration . " But I did mean a real sword ! " " I tried for a real sword , " Mach said . " But I really did n't believe it would work . " " It did not work , numbskull ! In years of yore , thou wouldst have wrought a truly adequate blade . " " In just a day of yore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nettled . She softened . " Aye , sirrah , I forget ! Well , try again . " That seemed sensible . Mach set down the toy , concentrated on an image of a yard-long blade formed of stainless steel , and sang : " I 'll be bored without a sword ! " There was a swirl of fog before him . It dissipated , leaving ? nothing . Not even a toy sword . " Art sure thou art really trying ? " Fleta asked . " I thought I was , " Mach said , baffled . " The first must have been a fluke . " " Canst not get through without a weapon , " Fleta said . " I could make a weapon . " " And conjure another toy ? This be tiresome ! " " I mean by hand . " " By hand ? " " To craft it from a natural object . A stone , or a piece of wood . " He looked about as he spoke . There were many stones along , the slope they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between the trees . " An thou dost try to bop a dragon on the snout with a mere stone , thy hand and half thy arm will pay the forfeit , " she pointed out . " Unless I threw the stone . " " Then thou wouldsc not have thy weapon anymore . "  | " Urn . Maybe an axe , then . " He walked back to the slope , peering at the offerings . He found several nicely fragmented stones with sharp edges . When he found one of suitable shape , he kept it and started his search for a handle . " Are there any Ines around here ? " " Vines ? Thou meanest to tie up the dragon ? " I le laughed . " No . To tie on my axehead . " He found a stout tick of suitable size . She wended her way among the trees , and soon found a vine . he tugged at it , but it would not come free from the tree . He ? fined her , setting his hands above hers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself up . He lost his balance d fell into her . She let go , and they both tumbled to the ground . " ( ; 1 msy oaf ! " Fleta exclaimed , trying to extricate herself from ' s involuntary grasp . " Willst tear my cloak ! " " Sorry . " He helped her get free , somewhat diffidently , because e kept reminding him of a Citizen . Nevertheless , the brief ? ntact reminded him forcefully how nicely endowed she was , the feminine sense . His breakup with Doris in Proton still wig ; it would be nice to But of course he knew almost nothing about this pretty young ) man . She seemed to know a lot about him , or about Bane , so ked that disadvantage . She had come to join him in the crater , ? parently intentionally , because she took him for her old friend . et there were ways in which that association seemed other than dittary friendship .

It was almost as if c were his sister , or perhaps half-sister , close enough to have secrets or shame , yet distant enough to be aware of him as a ale . Of Bane ; this intimacy obviously did not extend to Mach . to It found himself jealous of that intimacy , of whatever nature . Meanwhile they had a challenge in this vine . It was good that was tough ; he needed strength . But how could he get a suitable ngth of it for his purpose ? Alta ! Ile brought over his axehead stone . He held the vine fin with one hand , and sawed with the sharp edge of the stone . h a moment the vine parted . He had his cord . I le used the stone to split the end of the stick , then wedged  | the stone into that cleft , so that the sharp edge was at the side . He wound the vine around and around this joining , drawing it tight . He pulled the tag-end into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caught firmly . Fleta surveyed the result dubiously . " That be an axe ? " " A crude one . It will have to do . " " It will take more than that to stop a dragon . " " Then I will use it to make more than that . " Mach took his axe and chopped at a sapling . The head started to work out of its cleft , and the cord tried to unravel ; he had to rework both more carefully . But he managed to fashion a pole about two and a half meters long . " A staff , " he announced . " A dragon would chomp it off , " Fleta said . But she seemed halfway impressed . Mach checked the ground again , picking up a number of smaller stones . " And what be these for ? " Fleta inquired . " For distance operations . I 'll throw them to keep a monster away . " Canst throw well ? " " In my own body I have perfect aim ; it comes from long experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a swirl in the air , and vapor formed . But in a moment it dissipated . " What was that ? " Fleta asked , alarmed . " It resembled the effects when I tried to do magic , " he said . " But I was n't ? " " Thou didst speak in rhyme ! " she exclaimed . ... aim , . . . Game , " he agreed , remembering . " But I had no magic in mind ; it was an accident . " " If thou canst do magic by accident , why canst thou not do it on purpose ? " " But I tried to do it on purpose , and got nowhere . " She tilted her head thoughtfully . " There be things we know not about thy magic . Many a time I heard Bane conjure , but when I copied him , it worked not . Methinks it be a matter of person and of form , and if thou beest not he , yet dost thou possess the talent . Thou didst not even sing that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mach sighed . " I 'll try it again . " He held up his hand . " I thirst ;  | I chink  --  I want a drink , " he singsonged , visualizing a nutrabeverage . The fog swirled , and the tall cup appeared in his hand . " It worked ! " he exclaimed . " It doth look more like mudwater , " Fleta commented . " Nutra is opaque . " He brought it to his mouth and sipped . I ie spat it out . " That is mudwater ! " Fleta laughed . " I told thee ! " " So I bungled it again . But I did conjure it ! " " Methinks there be much learning to thine art , " she said . " Surely so ! Maybe I should practice . " He set down the cup , held his hand up again , and repeated his incantation . This time the fog swirled , but all that came to his hand was a tplat of mud . Fleta laughed again . " What a clumsy Adept thou @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He did not intend to have it hit cr , but his aim was better than intended ; the mud scored on cr neck just above her robe , and slid down her front . ' " I'hou monster ! " she exclaimed , scooping up a handful of oist dirt where the mudwater had spilled . " Now wait ! I did n't mean to ? " I ier heave caught him on the forehead . " Now we be even , " I ? 1e said with satisfaction . Mach decided to let it go at that . " But how do we get clean ? " " We wash in the stream , " she said . She showed the way down rough the forest to a tiny stream . There was a pool just big nwugh to dip a hand into . Flera hesitated , then shrugged and pulled off her cloak . " Meinks I was foolish to react as I did , when I learned thou wast n the man I knew . I have no need for modesty before thee . " e mud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ er hands and scooped up water , splashing it against her torso . ue Ii had found her more alluring when she had donned the look , because in Proton covering was the mark of power and prsv , u y ; now he reacted even more to her renewed nakedness. ' little was something about the water and the way she washed hrctirlf off . Hera , ( lean , shook herself . Her breasts seemed to move in- dependently of her torso . Then she paused , looking at him . " And what be that ? " she asked , smiling impishly . Mach abruptly felt himself flushing . He turned away . " I said not it was wrong ! " Fleta exclaimed . " Methought I moved thee not , Bane , since we achieved maturity . " " I am not Bane , " he said tightly . How could this have happened to him ? As a robot he reacted sexually only when he chose to , never by accident . " Aye , that thou art not , " she agreed softly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other , when we were young . We  --  Bane and I  --  played games we ne'er told the adults . " " And we of Proton , " he agreed . " But I did not mean to  --  I did not realize this would happen . " " Nor I , Mach . But would I offend thee if I confess I be not grieved it did ? " His flush , by the feel of it , seemed to be fading , but not the rest . " Fleta , I really do n't know . Exactly what was the relationship between you and Bane ? " " Friends , " she said . " Good friends , as good as can be , though we ne'er made oath o n't . Secrets we had , only with each other . But then we grew apart . " " Friends  --  so close you even ? ? " She came and set her cool hand on his shoulder . " Mach , there be naught that human man and woman can do together that we did not do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it meant naught . Today it would be another matter , for we are grown . " " So I should not  --  react this way  --  to you , " he said with difficulty . She sighed . " Thou shouldst not , " she agreed . " We be too old for such games now , methinks . But Mach , fear not ; ne'er will I tell . " " We  --  you and Bane  --  are related ? " he asked . She burst into laughter . " Related ! " She reached around him from behind and hugged him . This did not help his condition , for her breasts pressed hard against his back . " Thou dost not know , really ? " " Of course I do n't know ! " he said , trying to be angry , but wishing he could turn and embrace her . How could he be so far out of control ?  | " Then shall I tell thee not , " she said , releasing him . " You said you would not tease me ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " I fear thou wouldst like not the truth . " " I always like the truth ! " " Then accept this , Mach : now I understand somewhat better the case with thee , and I be flattered , not annoyed , and would preserve it a little longer . Come , face me as thou art ; I have seen t hee thus before , and will speak of it not further , an that please thee . " He seemed to have no choice . He turned , and she neither laughed nor frowned , though she did look . He knelt by the pool and dipped out water to wash off his face . " We be not related , " Fleta said after a moment . " But naught more than games between us was e'er possible . " " I wish you would tell me why ! ' " When I tell thee , thou willst be angry with me , and that I seek not . " " I promise I wo n't be angry ! I just want to know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than he . " Methinks thou wouldst be more comfortable in clothing , " she said in a moment . " It be the custom here . " He realized that she was correct . To go naked in a culture where clothing was the norm was not sensible . He would have to suppress his natural aversion to misrepresenting his status , and become a normal person of this frame , at least until he learned how to return to his robot body . Likewise , he could not afford to presume too much on the fact that she had seen Bane in a state of sexual excitement when young ; obviously Fleta was no Sue h playmate now . Suddenly he realized why he was having trouble controlling his reactions : he was in a living body ! He breathed , he had a heartbeat , he had to eat and drink and eliminate  --  of course he tea ( ted sexually too ! This was not , he now understood , entirely voluntary ; when a stimulation came to him , his body reacted even when he did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have no special interest in sex until he chose to , as was the case in Proton , but the sight of Fleta 's wet and moving anatomy had bypassed his intellect and made his body react . Thus his surprised  | embarrassment . The circuits of living creatures were to an extent self-motivating . No wonder the folk here wore clothing ! Not only did it pre vent unwanted stimulation , it concealed unwanted reaction . " I 'll wear clothing , " he agreed . But still he wondered : if Fleta was , as she said , flattered rather than embarrassed by the evidence of his reaction , why did she say that there should be no such action between them ? If they had done it as children , and they were not related ( and why had she found that notion so hilarious ? ) , why was it wrong now ? Were they promised to other partners ? Yet she had not said that ; she acted as if there were some more fundamental reason why nothing serious between them was possible . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He cast about , looking for something that could be fashioned into clothing . All that he could see that had any such prospect at all was the large leaves of some trees . Well , they would have to do . Fleta helped him gather some good leaves . Then they used his axe to make slits in a vine , and passed the stems of the leaves through , with long-stemmed leaves overlapping short-stemmed ones , forming a kind of skirt . They wrapped the vine about his waist , and the leaves hung down to cover him to an extent . But already there was another problem . His shoulders were turning red . " Sunburn ! " Fleta said . " I forgot  --  thy kind suffers from that ; it be another reason you wear clothing . " His kind ? Was n't her kind the same ? " I suppose we could make a collar to suspend a shirt of leaves , " he said , not enthusiastically . As it was , the leaves brushed constantly against him , stirring awareness of a region @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conjure some cloth . " He tried : " I 'll be wroth , without some cloth , " he sang , visu alizing an enormous bolt of cloth . He got a fragment of cloth about the size of a Citizen 's hand kerchief . He grimaced . " And if I try it again , l 'll get a thread or two , " he muttered . " It never works the second time . "  | " Mach ! That be it ! " Fleta exclaimed . " Ne'er did I hear Bane se the same spell twice ! " " Good for only one shot , " he said , gratified by the revelation . " Canst try the same , with other words ? " " Why not ? " He pondered a moment , then sang : " Cloth : I plore , bring me some more . " He visualized an even larger ? At . And the fog swirled , and deposited twice as much of the same he of cloth as it had before . Now they understood the system . Mach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more cloth so he uld sew a shirt . Fleta seemed to have no knowledge of sewing . e found that variation of melody also facilitated the conjurans , and that he got more of what he visualized if he built up it by humming a few bars first . He was learning to be a ma-cian ! It was close to midday by the time they were ready to travel . nc had considered trying a spell to move them directly to the ue Demesnes , but decided not to ; he would probably drop em in the swamp instead . If the magic was going to foul up , t it foul up on details that did n't affect their living processes ! lie now wore crudely fashioned sandals , and a ragged broadrimmed hat , to protect his feet from abrasion and his head and ck from the sun , and in between was as strange an assemblage clothing as he could have imagined . Swatches of cloth , leaves , tics and even a patch of leather , all fastened together haphazIly . But it covered him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the embarrassment of possible involuntary react ns . Ile would get out of the costume the moment he returned Proton , of course ; rather , Bane would , for Bane would be kin his own body , and surely would recover his normal clothes . I ; u t , Mach himself would recover those clothes when he got k to the glade he had started from . M.0 li spied a huge shape in the sky to the south , where the thirvon was a ragged purple range of mountains . Those mounhum existed also in Proton , of course ; the natural geography of 11w two frames was supposed to be identical . " What 's that ? " " A dragon , " Meta said . " Hide if it come near . "  | " They are in the air as well as the water ? " " Aye , everywhere , and always hungry . Few other than an Adept fear not their like . " Mach could appreciate why . He kept a wary eye on the sky thereafter . The path reached the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remembering the dragon that had been here . Maybe it would be asleep . They had no such fortune . Fleta knew the path , and led him along it without misstep despite the murkiness of the water , but when they were too far along to turn readily back , the monster reared up . Gazing at it , Mach abruptly wished he were elsewhere . His axe and staff seemed woefully inadequate . The dragon was so huge ! " I can help , if ? " Fleta said . " My job . You get on to safety while I hold it off . " That sounded a good deal bolder than he felt . Still , his Game experience had acquainted him with different modes of combat , mock-dragons included . This was more nervous business than that , as it was real , but the same principles should hold . The dragon should be vulnerable in a number of places , and a bold enough challenge should dissuade it . The thing was , after all , an animal . First he tried his stones . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His aim was good ; he knew his capacity here . But the monster blinked as the stone flew in , and it bounced off the leathery eyelid . So much for that . Mach threw the second stone at the dragon 's teeth . This one scored , but the tooth it struck was too large and strong ; a tiny chip of enamel flew off , but the damage only aggravated the creature without hurting it . The third stone he aimed at the flaring nostrils . It disappeared inside  --  and the dragon sneezed . The target was too big and spongy , and the stone too small , to do sufficient damage . But it did verify what Mach wanted to know : that the tissue there was soft , not hard . Few animals liked getting their tender tissues tagged . Vapor swirled as the dragon warmed up . Mach hoped his  | clothing would shield him from the worst of the heat if he got blasted by steam ; meanwhile , he would do his best to prevent the dragon from scoring with it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's head loomed close , he poked it with the end of the pole . Surprised , the dragon snapped at the pole , but Mach swung it free . He was accomplishing his intent : he had the dragon trying to attack the weapon instead of the man . When the dragon 's teeth snapped on air , Mach reversed the pole and smashed it into the nostrils . The dragon reared back ; that blow smarted ! Then the dragon heaved out steam . But the range was too great , and the aim was bad ; no steam touched Mach . He aimed the pole at an eye and rammed ; again the dragon blinked , but the pole scored , and pushed in the eye before rebounding . This time the eye was hurt ; some blood showed as the dragon jerked hack and the pole fell away . " Thou'rt beating it ! " Fleta exclaimed , amazed . " I intended to , " Mach puffed , discovering that this effort was tiring him . He had forgotten , again : this living body lacked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , vented a horrendous cloud of steam , then harged back into the fray . So sudden was the thrust that Mach did n't have time to swing the cumbersome pole back into position . The dragon bit at it sidewise and chomped it in two . Mach drew his axe . Suddenly he was worried ; he had n't wanted to resort to this , because of the close contact required . But apparently the dragon had forgotten to use the steam , and just t harged in with jaws gaping . Mach stepped aside , and bashed his axe violently down on the dragon 's nose as the jaws closed on the spot he had occupied . The stone blade sank into the right nostril , hacking through the flesh . Blood welled out . But Mach was now on uncertain footing , and his step and blow had put him off balance . He took another step  --  and found no path . lie splashed headlong into the water . ' I'lie dragon was thrashing , really hurt by the blow to its nose , but it remained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whipped its snout about to pluck Mach out of the water . Fleta screamed . Without purchase on the path , Mach could not strike another blow , or even escape . He was helpless before those descending teeth . " Without aplomb , bring me a bomb ! " he sang with sudden inspiration . Fog swirled . The bomb appeared in his hand . He heaved it into the opening mouth . In a moment it detonated . The dragon paused , closing its mouth . Vapor seeped out between its teeth . Mach realized that he had again failed to conjure what he really wanted ; the bomb had been a dud , or at least too small and weak to do the job . The one he had imagined would have blown the monster 's head apart . The dragon lifted its head . Thick vapor jetted from its uninjured nostril . Its near eye bulged . The bomb had not really hurt it , but evidently the vapor bothered it . Mach remained in the water , watching . Then he caught a whiff of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smell from the times he had visited one of the garden domes in Proton , where they had occasional insect infestations , and flooded the domes with this vapor . It was supposed to be harmless to larger creatures , but human beings tried to avoid breathing it . Instead of a real bomb , he had gotten a bug-bomb . Now it was spewing its noxious vapor into the dragon 's mouth  --  and the dragon did n't have the wit to spit it out ! In a moment the dragon plunged under the water , but a trail of evil-smelling bubbles showed that the monster still had n't let go of the bomb . Mach smiled as he clambered back to the path . His bomb had done the job after all ! " Oh , Mach , I feared for thee ! " Fleta exclaimed , coming into his arms as he stood . She kissed him , then drew back . " Oh , I should have done that not ! " " Why not ? " " I think I like thee too well . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong ? " " Aye , " she agreed with a rueful smile .  | " You 're stubborn ! " " My kind be that . " " Well , I like you too , " he said . " I think you 're a great girl , and I wish ? " But he had to break off . What did he wish ? That he could stay with her ? That he could take her with him to Proton ? Neither was possible , as far as he knew . She drew away . " I was minded to  --  to do what I had to to save thee , but it happened so suddenly , and then thou didst vanquish the dragon alone . Thou art a hero , Mach ! " " Well , I was n't going to let it eat you , " he said . " Yes , thou didst urge me to safety , whilst thou fought . No man of Phaze would have done that for my like , except perhaps the Blue Adept , and that be different . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before transferring to Proton , where his magic did n't work . She referred to the other one , of course . But the two were alternate selves , and yes , either would have done the same to save a damsel in distress . " We must go on , before more come , " she said . " There are more water dragons ? " he asked , alarmed . " Many more , " she agreed . He hurried after her , anxious to depart this swamp .  | Bane stared . The landscape was absolutely barren . There were no trees , no bushes , no plants at all . There was only dry sand and grayish mist as far as he could see . It was dusk , but he realized that even by full daylight he would not have seen much more . " The country  --  where be it ? " he asked , horrified . " This is the country , Bane , " Agape said through the speaker grille in her helmet . " But it ca n't be ! There be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Proton , " she said . " Except within the domes . Did you not know ? " " I ? 1 thought it would be like Phaze , only less so , " he ad mitted . " This  --  how did it happen ? " " I do not know much about the history of this planet , but I believe it was once alive . But the residents paid no heed to the quality of its environment , and so gradually it became as it is now , with good air and life in the dome-cities , and had air outside It is not this way where you live ? " " It be all sunshine and forest and meadows where the unicorns  | graze and rivers and magic , " Bane said . " Oh , what a horror be here ! " " But that means that the one you seek is comfortable , for he is there , " she pointed out . " You can seek him as you intended . " " But  --  this , " he said , baffled by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ride . " " Ride ? There be no animals here ! " " There are vehicles . I think serfs are permitted to utilize them . " " Vehicles ? " " I do not know the specifics , but I am sure some are near , for the residents of the domes do not like to walk far outside . Let us look . " Bane let her take the lead . She moved around the curve of the building they had just exited , and there was an alcove with several squat shapes within . She trudged to one and lifted its glassy upper section . Inside there were two deep holes . She limbed into one . " This will do , " she said . " Take the other seat , Bane . I think I can drive this . " 1Ie climbed into the other hole . The transparent top settled down , shutting them in . Then there was a hissing , and gas swirled up . He tried to scramble out , but Agape restrained him . " It is not evil , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without the helmet . When the light shows green , it will be all right . " And in a moment a green light appeared before them , on a panel in the vehicle . Agape removed her helmet . " It will not release until I reseal my suit , " she said . " The gas out here would he harmful to my metabolism . " " But I want not to stay in here ! " he protested . " I want to look for mine other self ! " She smiled . " I think it is good that I am with you . I will make this machine perform . " She touched buttons before her , and took hold of a handle , bringing it out and down toward her . Suddenly the vehicle lurched forward . Bane almost leaped out of his seat , but this time padded straps appeared and restrained lum . I le peered out the forward glass . The terrain was coming toward him , as though he were riding a horse . " This  --  this be a wagon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "  | " Yes , it is a machine , like your body , but not as intelligent as yours . " " A machine , " he repeated , assimilating the concept . " Like .1 golem , or an enchanted object . " " I think your world is as alien to this one as is mine , " she said . " My world is natural . This be the alien one . " " With that , too , I can agree . " She glanced at him . " Where would you travel , Bane ? " " I  --  I had n't thought . I mean , I had expected to circle in the forest , seeking to intercept mine other self . But now I know not . " " The forest remains there , for him , " she reminded him . " I can circle if you wish . " And she guided the vehicle into a broad loop . " No , I have other thoughts , now . I think he would not have remained in the glade . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The night be closing rapidly . He would seek shelter . " " Would he know where to find it ? " That question did not ease Bane 's mind . " I fear not . He could follow the path , but it forks , and the one fork goes to the Unicorn Demesnes , while the other ? Oh , I hope he took that one not ! " " Where does it go ? " " To the swamp , where there be monsters . Of course , if they took him for me they would stay clear . " He brightened . " The clothing marks me as of the Blue Demennes . " " Clothing ? " " Yes . We wear clothing there . So ? " " But he is of Proton , " she pointed out . " Would he wear cloth ing ? " Bane 's heart sank . " Nay , I fear not . But if he followed that path naked ? " He shuddered . " If he should follow it , and wear his clothing so he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked . " It goes to an old empty crater the ogres used . But we cleaned them out . Sometimes Fleta and I would go there to play . " I lc. smiled privately . " Who is Fleta ? A girl-companion ? " He laughed . " Companion , yes ; girl , no . Tell me not thou'rt jealous of her , Agape ! "  | " I am your companion , and I am not a girl , " Agape said . " Am I permitted to be jealous ? " I le mulled that over . " I suppose there be a parallel , after all . ! eta and I were very close , as children , though I have seen not uch of her recently . Thou mayst be jealous if thou dost wish . " e smiled . " Thank you . " Suddenly he realized something . " I have reverted to mine own mode of speech ! I should have talked to thee  --  to you not thus ! " " Please , Bane , do not change your speech for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what it is to be in a strange society . " " Rut if others realize mine origin , there could be trouble . " He was also embarrassed to think that it had probably happened because he had been distracted by her voluptuous body . " I will not tell others , " she promised . I le believed her . He had no magic here , but he had a sense shout people , and he liked her . " Then let 's find mine other self . " " Of course . " " Rut let 's assume he followed the correct path . That would ke him to the Herd , and they would recognize him with or ithout clothing , and bear him home to the Blue Demesnes . " " The herd ? " " The local unicorn herd . They be all oath-friends with Neysa , d Neysa is oath-friend to my father Stile , so none would e'er o me harm . They would believe that Mach is me , under some ostile spell , so would take him home right away . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they ? " " North of the herd demesnes . In Phaze every type of creature of any significance has its own region , called its demesnes , and go do the Adepts , the leading magicians . Of course there be a number of unicorn herds , just as there be many werewolf packs , but the important ones to us be the oath-friends . " " Wolves too ? " " It all dates hack to when my father made the Oath of Friend.lnp with Neysa , so powerful it embraced all the members of the lt  --  rd and the Pack too . Because I be the child of Stile , I can afely go anywhere in those demesnes , because no unicorn or  | werewolf would harm me , and no lesser creature would dare to , for fear of the Herd and the Pack . So Mach will be safe . " " If he took that path , " she said . " He has to have taken that path ! " he said vehemently . " Oth-erwise " Surely he took it , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Blue Demesnes , and find him there , " he concluded . " And these are north of here ? " " Should be northeast of here . " " But ? " " They be north of the Herd , but the Herd be east of the glade where we exchanged identities . That glade coincides with Mach 's room in the dome ; that be why I was able to locate him there , and finally to achieve rapport with him . Since the two geographies be identical , I can find the spot here by taking the same route I would there . " He peered again into the darkening gloom . " I hope . " " There should be a map , " she said . " A map ? " " A map of Proton . All planets have maps . " She touched buttons , and a screen illuminated . Soon the map appeared . Bane stared at it . " That be Phaze ! " he exclaimed . " It says it is Proton , " she said . " See , here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glowing . " She pointed to the blinking spark of light on the map . " That be the Harpy Demesnes ! " he said . " Right above the Purple Mountains . " " Harpy Demesnes ? Was the city named after the harpies ? " " Impossible ! There be no harpies in Proton . " But then he reconsidered . " Still , that does sound like har as in harpy , and since it be a dome  --  Har-dome . Hardom . I wonder . " He focused on the other points of the map . " Down here be the Mound Folk of Phaze  --  and here be Moudom ! And here , farther to the east , be the demesnes of the Gnomes  --  and here be Gnodom ! They do match ! " " It really is a map of Phaze ? This seems remarkable , if there has been no contact between the frames . " " Maybe not . Up until twenty years ago , the frames were more  | t Iosely connected . There was a curtain that some folk could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother . How long ago were these cities named ? " She touched another button . " It says three hundred years ago , for most . " " Then that 's it ! They were named when Phaze and Proton were one , before they separated , and long before that separation became complete . The original settlers knew they were the same ! " " This is very interesting , " she said . " My own planet has only one aspect . " " That 's probably the case with most  --  you call them planets ? " " The satellites of other stars , far away . " He was distracted for a moment . " How far away be thine ? " " About fifty light years . " He shook his head . " That means naught to me . " She smiled . " Magic means nothing to me , but I accept your information on it . " He returned the smile . " I question not thy word , Agape . And thou art not a human being ? " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may participate without offense in this human society . " " Just as Fleta assumed human form to play with me , " he said . " I have no trouble with that . " " I am most pleased that you do not . Though my form in its natural state does not resemble yours , my protoplasm is similar and my emotions similar too . I wish to be your friend . " " Thou art my friend , Agape . Thou art helping me greatly . " " I am pleased to do so . Do you wish me to program this vehicle for the Blue Demesnes ? " " Program it ? " " To give it a directive that will guide it there without further guidance from us , " she explained . " But there be no Blue Demesnes here ! Just the spot where they be in Phaze . " " The map shows a location titled Blue , ' " she said . " Does this win ( ide ? " I le looked . " It does ! But how could that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been there not for three hundred years ! " " I do not know ; I have been only briefly on this planet . "  | " Well , go ahead and send the machine there . This is not much different from magic . " She operated the buttons . The vehicle turned , assuming the new course , and accelerated . It was full night now , but no stars showed ; the gloom masked whatever light might have tried to shine through . The vehicle 's front lamp shone forward , showing nothing but sand rushing past . This seemingly mindless progress made Bane nervous , so he averted his gaze . That brought Agape into view . " How long will it take to reach the Blue Demesnes ? " he asked . She touched another button . " About fifteen minutes . The vehicle is very fast . " " Fifteen minutes to accomplish a trip that would require a horse two hours ! " he exclaimed . " Space travel is much faster . " That reminded him of her origin . In the dim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human , and beautiful . Her hair framed her face with the color of a pale sunset , and her eyes seemed preternaturally deep . " Thou really art alien ? " he asked , finding this hard to believe . " Completely , " she agreed . " In physical form . " " Thou art the loveliest woman I have seen ! " " That is because I have shaped myself to be what your kind considers attractive . You would not find me so , in my natural state . " " Canst thou assume thy natural state now ? " " I can . But I think I would prefer not to . Your machine self perceived me in that state , and was not repulsed , but you arc human , and I want to attract you , not repulse you . " " Why dost thou care how I react to you ? If thou art as different as thou sayst , I must appear to be a monster to thee . " " Oh , no , Bane ! " she protested . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . I would like to be your girlfriend . " " Just because mine other self helped thee ? " " I like him well for that , but now I know you better , and I like you better . You are more alive . " " How could an alien creature be a  --  a girlfriend to me ? " " I was hoping you would he able to show me that . "  | He shook his head , still having trouble reconciling her words with her appearance . She was infernally beautiful , and he liked her personality ; it really did not seem alien . " Methinks I could show a real woman . But an alien might understand not at all . " She leaned close to him . " Please , Bane , I want very much to learn ! I will do anything you suggest . " Still that nagging doubt . " Why dost thou want to learn ? The human means of association and  --  and the rest should not cont ern a completely different creature . " " My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind calls our world Moeba . We have had no experience with the pairing of sexes . We pair any with any , as we choose . But we observe that most other species of the galaxy are twin-sexed , and this appears to confer an advantage in evolution , so that they achieved technology and space before we did , and now we are dependent on them for interplanetary trade and travel between the stars . We can learn whatever they teach us , so now we are constructing our own ships of space , but we believe we should also master their secret of evolution . This is one reason I have come to the Planet of Proton . To learn about the sexes . I have assumed the female form because it is relatively passive ; I believe I can learn better this way . But learn I must , so I can report to my kind and they can judge whether this is a feasible course . " " I thought thou didst plan to stay here , " he said , finding himself disappointed . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can . I will become a Citizen if I can . I will send my reports by spacemail ; I will remain here . There is more to learn here than sexual reproduction . " " Then thou willst be a human being for the rest of thy life , or seem to be . " " Yes , Bane . Already I feel somewhat human , with you . " " Willst thou show me , at least a little , thy true form ? " " I do not wish to revolt you , Bane . " " I will make thee a deal , " he said . " Show me thy true nature , and I will show thee how to  --  to be a human woman . Some . " " Some ? Bane , I must learn it all ! " " But these things are not done just as a business , " he protested . " It ? I have never clone it all with a human woman , actually . Just games with Pieta and the like. , ,  | " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little , " she offered . He laughed , somewhat uneasily . " Fair enough , Agape . Here be a little . " He leaned farther toward her , tilted his head , and touched her lips with his own . Her lips were unresponsive . It was like kissing mush . He drew back . " That was it ? " she inquired . " Thou dost have to kiss back ! " he exclaimed . " You mean , to purse my mouth while you purse yours ? " " Aye . Only with some feeling . This be supposed to be an emotional contact , knowest thou not ? " " Ah , now I understand . To feel desire during the act . " " Thy kind does feel desire ? " " It does . It merely expresses it in another fashion . " " Shallst try again ? " He leaned forward , and touched her lips with his for the second time . And this time hers were firm and highly responsive . He found it easy to get into the spirit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and she emulated his action . He pressed her in close , and she pressed him in close , and it was several times the ex perience he had anticipated , despite the bulkiness of her suit . Except for one thing . She was doing what he did  --  too per fectly . She was like a three-dimensional mirror image . Nothing originated with her ; it all was a reflection of him . He drew back . " Much improved , " he said . " But thou must not copy me in every detail . That makest thou seem  --  like a ma chine . " She laughed . " I understand ! One must not be mechanical . " " Perhaps Mach would have had different advice , " he agreed , smiling . " I did not know you had changed identities , but I think I will know the difference hereafter . Though your body is a machine , your mind is alive . " He nodded . " I wonder how that be possible ? I certainly feel not like a machine . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a degree , " she said . " I do not feel like an amoeba , either . " She sighed . " And now I must make my small showing , and perhaps you will never kiss me again . "  | " I 'll make the effort , " he promised . She peeled back her suit , so that she became bare to the waist . " Watch me . " " I be watching thee . " " My hand , not my torso . " " Oh . " He modified his gaze accordingly . She held up her left hand . It was a fine , esthetic extremity , with four slender fingers and an opposed thumb , each nail delirately tinted . But slowly it changed . The fingers lost firmness , he coming floppy balloons . They sank back onto the body of the hind , which melted into a glob . Bane stared . " Thou hast no bones ? " No bones anywhere in my body . Only tissue that I make firm , patterned after human bones , to support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does it instantly . One moment she ? a pretty girl ; the next she be a hummingbird . Of course that 's magic . " " I can not do that , " Agape admitted . " It does require a little time for me to change , and I must melt into my natural state ? fore assuming an alternate form . And  --  I do not know the ummingbird . Is it of similar mass to the human form ? " Bane snorted . " Hardly ! It 's a tiny thing , hardly bigger than my thumb . Size matters not , with magic . " " I find that hard to believe . " " I think anyone in Proton would find it hard to believe . " " My mass remains constant . I could assume the form of a bird , but it would be of my present weight , and could not fly . " " Thy hand  --  it could become something else ? " For answer , she concentrated . The lump of protoplasm at the end of her arm grew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had about thirty thin fronds there . " A Formu an appendage , " she said . " I remember that form from the time I visited their planet . " " So thy magic be limited in speed and size , but unlimited in form , " he concluded . " I think thy ability be as good as Fleta 's . " ' " Thank you  --  I think , " she said . The new appendage dissolved , and the human hand began to reform . " You are not revolted ? " " Agape , I he used to shape-changing . Once did I envy the  | werewolves their ability to change from human form to canine form , and have all the powers of the animal . And I liked Flet.r in all three of her forms . " " Then I am relieved . I will change form for you , when you ask me to . " She leaned toward him , and he , understanding her desire , kissed her . This time she was responsive without mirroring him . She was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " We are there , " Agape said , hauling up her suit and restoring her helmet . " We shall search for your other self now . " Bane was almost disappointed . He cared less about shapes than about personality , thanks to his experience with the magical creatures of Phaze , and both her human form and her attitude were easy to accept . It was too bad he would lose contact with her when he exchanged places with his other self and returned to Phaze . They opened the vehicle and stepped out . They found ruins . There had evidently once been a small dome here , with a castle in it of the same type as that of the Blue Demesnes in Phaze , but all was wreckage now . The desert sand was doing its best to bury the remains . But there was no wreckage in Phaze . Bane walked around the oddly familiar premises , seeking some hint of his other self . 11 he overlapped the space , or even came close , he would know . It would not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right through others in Phaze , and never know . But his own self lw could not miss . It was n't here . There was no sign of the self at all . Bane criss crossed every part of the ruin , finding nothing . " He did n't get here , " he said at last . " Surely some delay , " Agape said quickly . " Proceeding afoot , unfamiliar with the terrain  --  it might require days . " " It might . It also might mean he 's dead . " " We must not believe that ! " she said . " I  --  I have no expel-it'll ( r ? with this phenomenon of dual selves , but I conjecture  --  would n't you feel something if there were demise ? Is there not souun ' continuing connection between the two of you ? " " I suppose there should be , " Bane agreed thoughtfully " I  | ned in to him in the first place by going with the flow . The loser I got , the more I felt it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she urged . I le stood and listened . He tried to extend his awareness out , o become perceptive to the soul of his other self , wherever it ight be . He could almost see his ambience reaching out in a cat circle , sensitive to the ambience of his other identity in Phaze . Ile found it ! Faintly in the distance , like an echo , he felt the port . " He be alive ! " he exclaimed . " There ! " He pointed to c southwest . " Back the way we came , " Agape said . " Or a little west ; the hicle curved eastward . " " We can go directly toward him ! " Bane said , relieved . " Oh , ank thee for the notion , Agape ! " He took hold of her , intending kiss her , but discovered it was impossible while she was in uit and helmet . They returned to the vehicle . The dome of it sealed , and the ' r came in . Agape lifted back her helmet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Just to go toward my other self until we intercept him , " he ' d . Then , becoming aware of her expectant attitude : " Oh , yes . " e leaned over and kissed her . This time it was about as good it seemed likely to get , in this circumstance . That gave him pause . " When I  --  thou willst be left here , with a ( h . " " I know you must return to your own land , " she said . " For ) u , Proton is more alien than it is to me . " " I ) ost thou know , Agape , I almost wish I could take thee with c . " " I almost wish I could go , " she agreed . " But even as your place there , my place is here . I have a duty to my species that I must 11111 . So I think that even were it possible , I would not go with you to your magic realm . I remain glad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't seem to be much more to say . Agape started the vvhut lc moving , and guided it in the direction he indicated , this time keeping it under her own control . They proceeded slowly toward the rendezvous with his other self .  | After an hour of travel through the wasteland , they were startled by a voice from the vehicle 's speaker grille . " Directive : Serf Mach return immediately to base at Hardom . Serf Agape return immediately to base at Hardom . " " They are addressing us ! " Agape said . " I must acknowledge . " " Wait ! " Bane snapped . " Thou meanest we can speak to them ! " " When I invoke the communication code , " she said . " It will only require a moment . " She reached for the panel . He blocked her hand . " Nay ! If we speak to them , they will know we hear them . I must find my other self before we leave this course . " " But to disobey would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might cost me my rendezvous ! We have been getting closer ; I can feel it . I can quit not now ! " " But there will be punishment . " " They can punish me not after I 'm gone ! " Then he recon sidered . " But thou willst still be here  --  and Mach too . That be bad . " " Serf Mach and/or serf Agape , " the speaker said . " Your ve hicle is occupied and moving . If you are alive and conscious , respond immediately . " " We must answer ! " she said . " But if we do n't , they 'll think we be dead or unconscious , and I can reach mine other self . " " I should not do this , " she said , keeping her hands away from the panel . " I 'll make it up to thee ! " he said . " I 'll show thee all I know about  --  about being a girlfriend . " She smiled with a certain resignation . " Before or after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course ! I can do it not after . " " Then that must be now . " Now he realized the significance of her question . If he took time now , he might lose his chance to achieve rapport with his other self , because there was no way to tell what threat the other might be under in Phaze . He could n't afford to wait a moment longer than he had to . But if he did n't do it now , it would n't get done at all .  | " Mayhap thou canst tell the vehicle to move by itself , as thou Midst before , " he suggested . " 1 must give it a destination  --  and I think there is none it will understand , for this . " She was right again . He had to tune in on the other self , and she had to direct the vehicle to the spot he indicated . They could not let the vehicle run itself . " We shall have to stop for a while , then , " he said heavily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with your desire . Go to meet your other self . " " And leave thee here , without thine information , to be maybe sent back to thy world because thou didst help me , " he said . " I can do that not . " " I think Mach would show me , if I explained . Do not delay . " " I want to show thee myself ! " he said . " It be my job . " " I release you from it . " " Nay , what be right be right . Anyway ? " He paused with realization . " I really do want to do it myself . I mean , not because 1 said I would . I ? " " Do not forget , I am an alien creature , " Agape said . " Thou'rt a nice person , in human form , " he said . " Stop the vehicle . " " But you must not delay ! I understand that . " " We have a conflict of interests . My father taught me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost . Thou mayst have cost thyself thy stay on Proton , by helping me ; I must risk my return to Phaze , helping thee . It be right . But more : I have n't known thee long , Agape , but I like thee very well already . I want to do what thou dolt want me to . " She had a notion . " Perhaps we could keep the vehicle going , on a semi-automatic course , and you can tell me when to correct it . So no travel time would be lost . " " Will that work ? " " We shall find out . " She adjusted the buttons on the panel , then settled back . The vehicle kept moving . " Oh , Agape , I wish I had met thy like in Phaze ! " he exclaimed , leaning over to kiss her . This time the experience was intensely rewarding .  | In moments she was out of her suit and hugging him hungrily . But the seat restraints would not release their lower extremities while the vehicle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too whenever there was a bump . This severely limited the action . " I will deactivate the restraints , " Agape said , touching the panel again . " Serf Mach and/or serf Agape , " the speaker said , startling them both . " Vehicle safety restraints have been deactivated . This indicates conscious activity . Acknowledge status immediately . " " Canst silence it ? " Bane asked . " Serf Mach return immediately to base at ? " the speaker said , cutting off as she touched another button . " What should I do now ? " Agape asked . " Come join me in my seat  --  no , I 'll join thee in thine ? " Bane hesitated , finding neither location suitable . Each place was made for one person ; there really was not room for two , especially not for this type of activity . They needed more space . " In my natural state , there are no such problems , " Agape said . " But of course our forms are not fixed . " " Do n't change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be a way ! " They tried for some time to find a way , but the confines of the vehicle were simply too restricted . Kissing and some handling were all they could manage . Then there was a crash . Both were thrown against the front panel . The vehicle tilted and tumbled . It came to rest abruptly , and the smell of the polluted air outside came in . " Dome 's cracked ! " Agape exclaimed , scrambling desperately back into her suit . " We watched not , and we hit something , " Bane said , chagrined . They forced up the canopy and climbed out . The headlamp shone off at an angle , but the beam of light was enough . " The lattice ! " Bane cried . " I forgot the lattice ! " " This is an interruption in the terrain ? " " Worse than that ! It be a pattern of cracks in the ground , very deep . Demons lurk in their depths . Only a unicorn can cross it without falling in , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | pattern exists in Proton , only without the demons . We be lucky we crashed in the shallow part of it ! " Agape leaned into the vehicle and caused the map to appear . " Yes , it is there  --  LATTICE , " she said . " I should have checked for hazards of terrain . Now I see why the vehicle traveled in a curve going north . " " We 'll have to go around , " Bane said . " I fear not , Bane . The wheel is broken , and we have not the means to repair it . We shall have to walk . " " Around the lattice ? That would take forever ! " " Will your other self cross it ? How will he do it ? " " He would have to skirt it to the south , " Bane said . " But I want him not to do that , because the demons watch the path . They 'll come out and grab him . I need to intercept him before he gets here . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she asked , alarmed . " Me ? Hardly ! I would float them into the river . But Mach wo n't know magic ; it takes years to learn to do it properly , and only a few even have the talent . He may not . " " Then I suppose we had better walk , " she said . " Will help come for thee , if thou dost ask for it in the vehicle ? Thou couldst wait there , out of danger , while I go on . " " The cracking of the canopy would have caused an automatic distress signal to be launched , " she said . " They will be on the way already . " " Then I 'll get caught ! " he said . " I must get going ! " " I will come with you , " she said . " There may still be some assistance I can lend . " Bane doubted this , but liked her company , so he agreed . At the same time he felt guilty , because he had made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was likely to pay heavily for her involvement with him . He wished again that he did n't have to leave her . They walked , skirting the network of cracks , still homing in on the other self . Bane now judged it to be in the region of the rater ; evidently Mach had taken the wrong path , but somehow mule it through the swamp to relative safety . But there was no way out of the crater except back through the swamp , and if he  | tried that path again , the monsters would be twice as ferocious as before . Bane had to intercept him and make the exchange before Mach started moving again . Something glittered in the air . " Oh , no , " Bane said . " A night dragon ! " " Or a flying machine , " Agape said . " I fear they have discovered us . " We must hide ! " " We can not ; it is my suit and the metal in your body they orient on . Oh , Bane , I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Bane took her suited form in his arms , unspeaking . He discovered that he was not as sorry as he thought he should have been . They waited for the flying machine to capture them .  | Evidently the news had spread among monsters that Mach was a creature to be reckoned with , for no others threatened them on the path through the swamp . They returned to the glade where he had left the clothes , but the clothes were gone . " The pigheads , " Fleta muttered . " They root for aught not held by spell . " So he would have to continue with his makeshift outfit . Mach shrugged . After the amount of effort he had put into it , he might as well use it ! " Now this path bears south , " Fleta said , indicating the one he had left before . " But it leads to the Herd Demesnes , and once in that open country , we can trek north as far as the Lattice . " She glanced sidelong at him . " Mayhap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 've already been carried by a unicorn ! " Mach exclaimed . " Look where it got me ! " " Aye , then shall we walk , " she said , somewhat wearily . " Never fear , we shall see thee safely to the Blue Demesnes . " They walked the path . It was pleasant enough , now that they  | were clear of the swamp . The great trees leaned over to spread their shade graciously , and the ferns seemed to keep the ground clean . Fleta paused to sniff the air in the fashion of an animal . " Me thinks I smell aught foul , " she remarked . " Best we not pause . " The path followed a ridge , then curved to the east and dropped down to a stream . Mach was ready to wade through , but Fleta held him back . " Not this one ; there be poison in it . We most touch not the water . " " But it is too broad to jump over , " he said . " There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across and tie it in place . " She pointed , and there across the stream was a this k coil of ropes . " How do we pull it , without first crossing ? " " There be a string . " She reached up near a branch , her fingers questing for it . Then she stamped her foot with sudden anger . " It be not here ! " There was a raucous cackle from the bushes at the far side . " Thou dost bet it be not there , nymph ! " a voice cried . " Methought I winded garbage ! " Fleta snapped . " Smile when you say that , cutie-pie ! " the other responded . " Thou'rt in Harpy Demesnes ! " And the speaker came into view : a gross , filthy creature , with a woman 's head and bosom , and , a vulture 's wings and tail and legs . The odor became stronger . " And thou'rt in ' corn Demesnes ! " Fleta retorted . " Didst mess with the ladder ? Thou knowest that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tween species ! " " What dost the like of thee know of any pact ? " the harpy demanded . " Dost think canst trot thy stud past Harpy Demesnes w ' impunity ? Stay , filly , an we 'll goose thee across in our own fashion , after our sport with the other . " " What sport ? " Mach asked , not liking the harpy 's attitude . " Their kind be e'er shy of males , " Fleta muttered . " I 'll say no more . " " Well , I 'll say more ! " the harpy screeched . " First we 'll strip the leaves off thee , my fine morsel , then we 'll hold thee down while our choicest hen has at thy ? " But Mach had grasped enough of the picture by this time . I lc hurled his axe at the obnoxious body . The harpy spread her wiii ,  | nd sailed upward with a desperate screech , barely in time ; the $xe knocked loose several greasy tailfeathers . " Wait and see , stupid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 ) ost not know thou'rt already the plaything o ' an animal ? We 'll *how thee some real play , an I bring my siblings back in a mo-ment ! " Furious , Mach hurled a stone at her , but the creature was already flapping her way between the trees to the west . He turned to speak to Fleta , and paused with dismay . She was gone . Astounded , he cast about . She could n't have returned along the path , for he had been on it and she had n't passed him . She could n't have hurdled the stream ; she was too small . She must have gone into the bushes along the bank of the stream , searching for some other way across . But so quickly and silently ; he had never seen her go ! What had that harpy said about Harpy Demesnes ? Mach suddenly made a connection . He had lived in Hardom , a city named , it was claimed , after the mythical harpies of Phaze . All the cities of Proton had similar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the appendage " dom " for dome . He had taken it to be an innocent affectation . Now , abruptly , he realized that it could be more than that . There really were harpies , every bit as ugly as described in the myth , and apparently this was their region . Thus , perhaps , the geography of Proton did correspond with that of Phaze , to this extent . There could be a great number of the filthy birds in the vicinity ! Then he heard a humming . He looked , and there was a bright little hummingbird , hovering over the path . Then it darted across the stream , touched the coiled rope ladder , and took hold of a thread there . It carried this thread back across the stream , right to Mach himself . Amazed , he lifted his hand and took hold of the thread . The tiny bird let go and darted away , its errand done . Mach pulled on the thread , and it became a string , and then a stout cord that finally enabled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tied its two loose ends to the broad branch , making sure it was firm . Now he needed to find Fleta , because he certainly was not  | going to leave her to the mercy of the harpies . Where had she gone ? He peered into the bushes . " Fleta ? " " Yes , Mach ? " she said right behind him . He jumped . " Where were you ? I was afraid ? " She shrugged . " A girl needs some privacy sometimes . " " She does ? " She laughed . " Wait till thou dost have to do it ! I 'll stand and watch . " " Do what ? " " They do n't have to do it in thy frame ? " " Do n't have to do what ? " " Defecate . " " Of course they defecate ! Why do you ask ? " Her mirth became genuine curiosity . " But thou dost not ? " " I 'm a robot . " " Thou seemst much like a man to me . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A ? " He paused with belated realization . " Defecation ! You mean you had to ? " Her amusement returned . " I had not dreamed it such a wellkept secret ! All those who eat must cast their leavings , e'en young females . " Now he found his face burning again . " I did not ? " " Truly , thou'rt not the one I knew ! " she said merrily . " He ne'er had such confusion ! " " Well , he had functions I do n't . " But as he spoke , Mach re alized it was n't true . He was in the living body now . In the night he had had to urinate , and now he felt an increasing abdominal discomfort . He realized that it had been building up for some time , but because he had no prior experience with digestion , he had dismissed it . He had been lucky that he had understood the process of urination ; he could have become quite uncomfortable otherwise . Fleta shook her head with a certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we must cross before the dirty birds return . " " Yes , indeed ! " he agreed . She showed him how to navigate the ladder . She climbed  | nimbly on it , then crossed over the river by using her hands and feet in the rope rungs . He followed , quickly adjusting to its give and sway , and scampered to the other end . He found his fallen axe and picked it up . " Now must roll it again , " she said . " But I tied it on the other side ! " he said . She smiled , and untied it on the near side . As the second rope was freed , the ladder rolled itself up , as though guided by invisible hands along an invisible floor , and finished in one tight coil against the far tree . Only a thin thread remained behind , anchored to the rear tree . It was ready for the next user . " Close thy mouth , Mach , " Fleta said . " Else folk might think thou hast ne'er @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They faced down the path . " Uh , if we can wait a moment , " he said . " Wait ? Whatever for ? " she asked brightly . His intestine was becoming quite urgent now . " The  --  pri-vacy ? " " Rovots need no privacy , " she reminded him . " That 's changed . Why do n't you go on ahead , and I will rejoin you in a moment . " " Oh , no , I must keep thee company , else thou dost get edgy . " He thought he was about to burst , and not from emotion . " I tan spare your company for this moment . " " Well ... " She took a step down the path , and he started to take one toward the bushes . Then she turned back . " No , I really must not leave thee unattended , Mach . This wood be not familiar to thee . Who knows what mess thou mightst get into , if ? " " Go ! " he cried . Suppressing a smirk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minx had known all along ! Ile plunged into the bushes , heedless of scratches . He found it halfway suitable place and set about removing the necessary portion of his clothing . But he had harnessed it about him so die ( tively that this was difficult ; it did n't want to come off . He had to wrench out his waist-vine , and then the leaves of his costume fluttered down , loose .  | He squatted and let living nature take its course . Then h remembered that the living people of Proton cleaned themselves after this act , so that no soiling or odor would occur . They used special paper for this purpose , or a sonic mechanism . He had neither here . He cast about , seeking some substitute . Nothing seemed offer . He did n't want to use any of the cloth of his costume . He heard a heavy flapping . The harpy loomed . He tried to duck down out of sight , but she spied him . " Ho , what have we here ? The bare essence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he exclaimed , embarrassed . " Hey , girls , we 've found him ! " she screamed . " I spotted him by the stench ! " She laughed with a cackling sound . Now there was a whole flock of them , flapping in to see . Mat It realized that he had indeed gotten into a mess . Those dirty birds were after more than laughter ; their narrow eyes gleamed and their talons convulsed and drool dripped from their open mouths . He realized that he could n't escape them by running . I 1 is clothing was falling apart , and the bushes hampered him , and they were airborne and numerous . They would have him in a moment . He lifted his axe , but they hovered just beyond its range , screaming imprecations . He could throw it , but then he would be without a weapon . " Fresh meat ! " a harpy screeched , diving down from behind . He whirled and swung the axe , but she sheered off . Another dived from behind , and a third . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , ready to attack . Mach lunged to a tree , setting his back against it . Now he could defend himself better . But he could n't get away , and when his arm tired In the distance was the sound of hoofbeats . There was music , too : the melody of panpipes . " Oh , damn ! " a harpy cried . The beat and music got louder as the source approached rap idly . The ground shook with the hoof-strikes . The pipes played a militaristic air . The harpies scrambled up through the air , shed ding feathers in their rush .  | The unicorn appeared , charging through the brush . Her horn speared at the last harpy , but the bird was already out of reach . " There 'll be another time , ' corn ! " she screeched . The unicorn stomped about , making sure that all the birds were gone . Then she leaped back toward the path , and the sound of her retreating hoofbeats faded . Mach relaxed . That creature had rescued him before , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and left again . Evidently , he had no ulterior motive . Maybe she was just a guardian of the path , routing whatever monsters intruded on it . That was fortunate for him ! He took a large leaf with which to clean himself off , then pulled his remaining clothing together as well as he could . He was even more ragged than before , but after the scrape with the harpies , he knew when he was well off . He made his way to the path . Fleta was coming back along it . " Oh , Mach ! " she exclaimed , spying him . " I feared for thy safety ! " " So did I , " he admitted . " But the unicorn saved me  --  again . " " Aye ; I summoned her . These be the Herd Demesnes . " " You summoned the unicorn ? How could you do that ? " She shrugged . " There be more to magic than conjuration . That creature is no enemy of thine , Mach . " " Apparently not . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Who can e'er know the true heart o ' another ? " " Who , indeed ! " She peered at his outfit . " I see ? " " Never mind what you see ! " he snapped , trying to adjust a swatch of cloth . ... that thou hast lost thy leaves , " she finished , returning to her normal impishness . They walked on along the path . It took them east for perhaps two kilometers , then debouched onto a broad grassy plain . Mach stood and stared . " 1-last ne'er seen grazing land before ? " Fleta inquired . " Never before , " he agreed . " This is marvelous ! This whole world is green and growing ! " " And thine is not ? "  | " Mine is not , " he agreed . " Outside the domes there is only barren sand and air that living people ca n't breathe . " " Air not to be breathed ? How can that be ? " " Pollution . The mines and factories pumped their wastes into the ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was extinguished . The only suitable environment for life is main tained within the domes . " She shook her head . " Methinks I would not like thy world ! " " I never thought about it . But now that I 've seen this  --  I think I do like it better than Proton . " Actually , it was life he was coming to like , despite its inconveniences . He had never before expo rienced the sheer feeling of it . Even the discomfort was a pleasure of a sort , because it was an aspect of the new responsiveness of his body . When he made an error and suffered pain , that rep resented a far more effective feedback than the cautionary circuits he had known . A robot , for example , could chew a hole in his own finger , and some did , because there was no pain . That was unlikely to happen with a living person . " Dost like the taste of thy finger ? " Fleta inquired teasingly . Mach jerked it away from his mouth . Had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thou'rt funny , " she said . " And you are lovely , " he said . He reached for her , and she did not avoid him , and he brought her in to him , and she did not hold back . He kissed her , and she kissed back . " Ah , Mach , this be foolishness , " she said . " But I do like thee . 1 shall miss thee sorely when thou returnest to thy world . " Mach thought again of Doris , the cyborg girl with whom he had kept company . He had evidently liked her better than she liked him . He had known Fleta less than a day , yet already he felt a greater emotion for her than he had for Doris . That could be accounted for by his living system , whose functions and cm() tions could be stirred on an involuntary basis . But it seemed to him , objectively , that Fleta was a nicer girl than Doris , even after all reasonable allowances were made for the differences between their frames and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for us  --  for you and me  --  to like each other ? "  | " Mach , I think it is . I  --  there are things about me that  --  an ye knew of them , I think thou wouldst not hold me this close . " " Yet you know of them  --  and you do not object ? " " Mayhap I be more foolish than thee . " And she kissed him again . The kiss became intense , and he knew that whatever else might be the case , her feeling for him was genuine . She believed that he would not like her , once he knew her secret ; he doubted that this would be the case , but the knowledge that he could not remain with her after he learned how to return to his own frame restrained him . She was forbidden , not because there was anything wrong about her , but because he was not of her world . He found that deeply disturbing . " Be these tears thine or mine ? " she inquired . " Mine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Nay , mine too , and I think not my last . " " Fleta , I like you because you are a lovely girl who has helped me face this strange world . I lost my girlfriend in the other frame . Therefore my foolishness is understandable . But if you know we are not for each other , why do you waste your time with me ? " " I should not answer , " she said . He smiled sadly . " But I think you will . " " I will . My  --  my mother loved thy father  --  I mean Bane 's father , but always knew he must wed Bane 's mother , the Lady Blue . And so it was , and rightly so . " " The Lady Blue ? " he asked . " Citizen Blue is my father . " " Aye . He married first the Lady Blue , and then he died , and then he went to thy frame and begot thee . Adept Stile stayed here and begot Bane . And I , even as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew better ; ' t was e'er a game with him . But thou dust not know , and  --  and 0 , I do thee such wrong ! " " Then tell me the wrong you are doing , so I can judge for myself ! " She shook her head . " Too soon thou willst know , and then it will end . I lack the courage of my mother ; I can not tell thee yet . " " You are married to another ! " he exclaimed . " Nay , Mach ! " ' Then I am ! Or about to be . Something like that . " " Nay , we both be free , that way . "  | " Then I just do n't understand ! " " For that give I thanks . " She kissed him again , then separated . " We must on to the Blue Demesnes . But it be noon ; we must eat , ere we grow weak from hunger . " " You 're changing the subject ! " he said . " Aye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and let me judge . " " What dost thou think of animals ? " she inquired . " Animals ? ' You mean like  --  like dragons ? " " Aye . And pigheads and such . " " I do n't see the relevance , but very well , I 'll answer . I 'm a robot , so I have n't had much experience with animals of any type . But I know they are living creatures , and so they have needs and feelings , and that is to be respected . That unicorn , for example ; twice she has saved my life , but I do n't know her motive . But regardless , she 's a beautiful creature , and I respect her view of her life . As long as an animal does n't attack me , I  --  well , what are animals except other kinds of living creatures ? The least of them has a greater personal reality than I do . " She embraced him again . " Thou'rt lovely , Mach . " " Now will you answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " But I answered yours ! " " Aye . " She disengaged , giving him no further answer . Fie sighed with frustration . There was so much he had yet to learn about the ways and motives of living creatures , Fleta especially . She found them more fruit , and they ate . Then they trekked north across the plain . Mach 's living legs were tiring , but he did not complain ; after all , if delicate Fleta could keep the pace , so could he . Progress was good , because of the open and level ground . But in midafternoon Fleta paused . " Mach , we have a choice , " she said . " The most direct path to the Blue Demenses be straight north from here , but the most secure path be toward the east " " What is the difference in time ? " " We might be there by nightfall , an we take the left through the Lattice . An we take the other , we must night on the trail , and arrive tomorrow noon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ path , so as to be the night with her , but discipline prevailed . " The left , then . " She nodded , and he realized that she had hoped he would choose the other path . He was coming to understand her quite well by the nuances of her gestures . But his machine heritage provided him a type of discipline that many living folk lacked . They went left , and within the hour reached the Lattice . This turned out to be a huge network of cracks in the earth . At the f ringe the cracks were shallow , but soon they became formidable , several centimeters across and quite deep , extending in endless zigzags . They had to step carefully to avoid wedging their feet in them . The cracks became larger yet , until they were chasms in themselves . " Now must we be silent , " Fleta said . " Silent ? Why ? " " So as not to rouse the demons below . " Mach peered down into a crack . Demons down there ? After the monsters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more . They proceeded to a region where the cracks were so extensive that they covered more area than the ground did . Mach found this nervous business ; one slip could plunge him into the darkness below . But Fleta evidently knew where she was going . They came to a dead end . Ahead and to either side the crevices closed them in ; only behind was there a jagged path . Fleta gestured . Mach saw that the path resumed beyond a narrow part of the crack . They would have to jump . Fleta showed the way . She took a running start , then leaped , landing neatly on the other side . She moved back out of the way , giving him room . Mach followed suit . He had trained for jumping in the Game , and this body was the same as his own , apart from the fact that it was alive . It was healthy and responsive . He could handle this readily , even when tired . They went on , winding through the maze . Mach wondered how such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an equivalent feature in Proton ? He had never really explored the exterior world there ; now he wished he had . They came to another jump . Mach realized that Fleta knew  | exactly where the gaps were narrowest ; otherwise they would soon have been lost amidst impassable cracks . But just as she was about to leap , a grotesque head popped up from the chasm . " Hhaarr ! " it growled . " The demons ! " Fleta exclaimed with dismay . " Methought we would not rouse them ! " Other heads appeared from the cracks to the sides and rear . The two of them were surrounded ! " Seems more like a trap to me , " Mach muttered . " We were n't making a lot of noise . " Now the demons were scrambling to the surface . Each had a body as misshapen as its head . Short legs , huge long arms , bulbous chest-barrel , horns and tail . And gaping mouths bulging with yellow teeth . " There be no reasoning with demons , " Fleta said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not see much hope , but he was ready to fight . " Stand back to back with me , " he said , drawing his axe . " I 'll club any that come close . " " That will not stop them ; they feel not much pain . 0 , Mach , I fear the time has come to let the secret be known . " " Your secret ? " he asked , watching warily as the circle of de mons closed in about them . " I think it had better wait until we have fought off this crowd . " But he had severe misgivings about that ; each demon was approximately his own size , and there were many of them . Unless he could figure out an effective spell . What rhymed with " demon " ? " I be the unicorn , " Fleta said . " Thou must ride me to safety . Now ! " " You  --  what ? " But as he looked at her , she vanished . In her place was the black unicorn who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mach swung his axe , catching the creature in the face . The blade cut right through , splitting the head in two  --  but there was no blood , and the demon kept cons ing . Now he understood Fleta 's reluctance to fight these things , they were truly inhuman . He dodged the demon , then leaped to the hack of the uniu orn and grabbed a handful of black mane . " " fake off ! " She started moving . A demon grabbed for her , but the long  | horn whipped about and speared the thing , shoving it back and over into the chasm behind it . Then the unicorn started trotting hack along the path , where there were fewer demons ; progress forward was impossible , because there was a phalanx of the creatures . The demons pursued , but they could not match the velocity of the unicorn . In a moment the two of them were clear . But more demons were climbing from the cracks back along the path . There seemed to be an endless number of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jump , grinning . But now the unicorn had velocity and inertia . She charged straight into them , bowling them over . At the brink she leaped , carrying Mach and a clutching demon with her . Mach twisted about and clubbed the demon on the head ; when that had no effect , he chopped at the arm it had clutching the mane , and severed it . Then the demon dropped away , leaving the hand and part of the arm still locked on . Now the crevices became too small to hide demons , and that threat abated . The unicorn charged on , her hooves striking the firm places with precision . She knew what she was doing ; she must have traveled this route many times before ! In an amazingly brief time they were back at the fork in the path , alone . The unicorn stopped , and Mach dismounted . Without any intermediate stage , the animal vanished and Fleta reappeared . She looked at him sadly . " Now thou dost know , " she said . Suddenly it all made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the unicorn had heard , thinking him to be Bane , and had charged to the rescue of her long-time friend . She had taken him to the safety of the crater . Then , when he acted strangely , she had left him , only to return later in human guise . She had learned that lie distrusted the unicorn , and that he was not the friend she had known , so she had concealed her nature from him . When the harpies had attacked , she had had to change to the equine frm again , to rescue him . Then back to the form of the woman , to be his companion . And now , unable to save him any other way , she had revealed her secret at last . Now he remembered stray remarks . " Wouldst rather have me  | neigh ? " and " Wait till I tell the fillies of the herd ! " And the warning of the harpy that he was with an animal . And her reference to her " dam . " So many little hints , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about their acquaintance . She liked him ? but could not afford to love him . Because she was an animal , and he a man . She had played games with Bane , who knew her nature , as children would ; if the games became more intimate than those of normal children with normal pets , it was only because a unicorn was no normal pet . Fleta had human intelligence and feelings . So much she had done for him , knowing it to be futile as far as any enduring relationship went . Knowing that he would be leaving her , returning to his frame , helping him to do that . Knowing too that even if he remained here in Phaze , his attitude toward her would abruptly change the moment he learned her identity . Except that he was not precisely what she evidently thought he was . She believed he would reject her for being an animal . How would she react to learning that he was a machine ? " Let me tell you about me , " he said . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the son of the one who was the Blue Adept before Stile , his other self . " " I am more truly the son of Sheen , " he said . " Who ? " That was what he had suspected . The story of Blue 's marriage in Proton had not spread about the frame of Phaze . " Sheen is a machine , " he said . " A humanoid robot . Do you know what that means ? " " Why dost thou talk about such confusion , when I have at last revealed myself to thee and await with fear thy reaction ? " " Because I think I have a secret that will affect your attitude as much as your secret affects me . " " Thou'rt an animal of Proton ? I know thou'rt not ! " " I am a machine , the son of a machine . A creature of metal and plastic and other inanimate substances . " " Thou'rt flesh and blood ! " she protested . " I have seen thee bleed ! " " This body is flesh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it belongs . In Proton I am a robot . "  | " A rovot , " she agreed . " What type of person be that ? " " A creature who resembles a man , but is not alive . " " A golem ! " she exclaimed . Mach considered , then agreed . " Close enough . A creature who has been made rather than birthed . Who does not have to eat , or breathe , or sleep . Who can not feel pain . Who can walk indefinitely without tiring . Who can imitate the ways of a man , but is not a man . " " A golem , " she repeated , staring at him . " In Proton , in my own body , I am that , " he agreed . " I could ut off my finger , or my arm , or my head , and still function . " He smiled briefly . " Of course I would have some trouble seeing or hearing or speaking without my head . But I would n't die , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said again . " A thing without feeling . " " Well , I can feel ; I have tactile sensors . And I can feel mentally , too , because I am programmed for it . For consciousness . But it 's not the same as living . " She seemed stunned . She approached him , looking him up and down . Her lower lip trembled " 0 , what a fool I be , baring myself to thee , who canst not care . " Not care ? Mach enfolded her and kissed her . Suddenly all that had been revealed in the past hour ceased to have meaning . He was a machine and she was an animal , and they had known each other only a night and a day , and during most of that they had misunderstood each other . . . and they were close to being in love .  | The flyer carried them northeast across the wasteland at high velocity : the direction opposite to the one they wanted . The prospect of rendezvous became increasingly remote . Bane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vehicle not ! " he muttered . " My fault , " Agape said . " I asked you to show me ? " He put his fingers against her lips , silencing her . " It was something I wanted to do . Still want to do . " He put his arms around her , and she rested her head against his shoulder . She was out of the suit now , naked in the serf manner . " Perhaps if we explain to your family , they will help you , " she said . " Are they not good people ? " " Surely they be so , " he said . " They must be very similar to mine own parents . Probably I should have done that first . " " Then you would have been back in your own frame by now , and I would not have met you , Bane . " " And I would not have met thee , " he agreed , and hugged her closer . She was what she called an amoeba , a completely flexible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view from the way  | of any of the werefolk . She could be quite at home in Phaze . Of course he would probably not have been attracted to her , had he encountered her in Phaze . Fleta was as pretty in her human form as any true human woman , and as nice a person , but he had never been romantically interested in her . In Phaze , human beings could be friends with animals , and could play some rather intimate games with them , but they did not love them or marry them . His father 's friendship with Neysa , Fleta 's dam , had raised eyebrows in the old days , Bane understood . But Stile had married the Lady Blue , of course , and Neysa had returned to her Herd to be bred by the Herd Stallion . Thus Bane himself had come to be , and Fleta , and their lifelong association and friendship . He faulted none of this  --  but he would have perceived Agape as a form of animal , and that would have made a critical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was an intelligent and talented creature from another world . Because he had been introduced to her as that , or as a human being at first , his fundamental perception of her had differed . Then , when she had helped him so loyally , when he needed help most  --  but he could n't say all this . Not now , with the serfs of the flying machine listening . He just held her close and wished that she could join him in Phaze . For the truth was that though he had always understood he was to marry a human girl , he had found none he liked well enough for that . The village girls tended to be wary of Adepts , with reason , and avoided him whenever they could do so without giving offense . He had needed a relationship with a girl of some other Adept family  --  and the only ones of his age were in the families of the Adverse Adepts . Thus certain of the animal folk had been better company for him , though he had known this to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They passed from its lock directly into a dome , where serfs guided them to cleaning stalls and then to a residential suite . " Eat , sleep , " the foreman serf said . " Tomorrow Citizen White will have an audience . " " Citizen White ? " Bane asked . " I thought we were being taken to Citizen Blue . " The serf shrugged . " Perhaps the Citizen will explain . Meanwhile , rest . " That seemed to he it . Bane understood that in Proton , Citizens  | governed , and no serf could question the actions or motives of a Citizen . He chafed against the delay in his search for his other self , but knew he could do nothing . They might as well have been prisoners . But he remained with Agape , and that was a considerable . compensation . Now , without further guilt or distraction , he could complete his understanding with her . They went to the food dispenser in the suite , and Agape got a nutro-bev . Bane found that he was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but because his robot body did not require food . So he simply watched her eat . That turned out to be a remarkable experience in itself . Then they adjourned to the bedroom . " I can show thee now , " he said , though somewhat shaken by the recent spectacle of her meal . Still , she had warned him . " There be room enough here . " " Oh , Bane , I do want to know , " she said . " But I have been up and active for so long  --  it is past midnight now  --  I do not think I can hold my form much longer . I fear I would melt in the middle of it . " That could be awkward , Bane had to agree . " Rest , then ; we can do it in the morning . " He was privately relieved . He was , as he had told her , used to observing shape-changing in others , but this had been not exactly that . " You might not like to see me sleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natural state . " " Thy natural state should not bother me , " he said , hoping he spoke accurately . " But what will I do , while thou dost sleep ? This body be not tired at all . " " Use the computer access to gain entertainment or education , " she suggested . " Here , I will show you how . " Soon Bane was seated before a screen , watching three-dimes sional moving pictures within it . He found this fascinating , so very much like magic that it seemed pointless not to call it that . He could cause the pictures to change merely by telling them to . He directed the screen to fill him in on the history of Proton He wanted to know what had happened here after the frames had separated . He knew from what his father had said that one e ? there was fairly free travel between the frames ; cuh perinanent  | resident of one frame seemed to have an other self in their other frame , who resembled him exactly . But only when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the curtain to the other frame . Stile had crossed when the Blue Adept died , and Stile had taken Blue 's place in the Blue Demesnes . But Blue had not been quite wholly dead ; he had taken Stile 's body in Proton and taken up residence there . Stile himself had animated a golem body , which performed just like the original one . Such magnificent magic had been possible in those days . Then the fundamental stuff of magic , the rock Phazite , had been diminished ; half of it had been transferred to Proton for the sake of some complex but apparently necessary balancing of the frames , and magic had forever lost much of its potency . The frames had been fully separated , so that no one could cross over anymore . All this Bane had known all along . What he did n't know was how Proton had fared in the interim . Since he had to remain here awhile longer anyway , this did indeed seem to be the ideal occasion to learn about this . He knew that his father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the information turned out to be more complicated than he had supposed . There was so much of it ! When he asked for the " History of Proton , " the screen went back to the planet 's discovery more than four hundred years before by an explorer-ship from the Empire of Earth : a beautiful world much resembling Phaze today . But there were creatures already on it , Earthlike creatures , including a few human beings . This indicated that there had been contact before . Since there had been a number of private expeditions to space , and not all of these made proper reports , it was concluded that one of these had colonized the planet , and the descendents of the colony had then forgotten its origin . This could have happened hundreds of years before . Then it seemed that the planet was somehow double . There was reference to magic , which was of course impossible " Impossible ! " Bane snorted . " You idiot ! " The narration froze in place . " New directive ? " the screen inquired . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Bane said , deciding not to wrestle with this aspect . Even so , it was more than he could grasp . History turned out  | to be not a single and straightforward process , but a complex tapestry of events . Citizens lost their positions , and new ones came into being ; the mining of Protonite , the key resource of the planet , suffered a severe readjustment as cutbacks ordered by Citizen Blue took effect . Citizen Blue ! " Follow him ! " Bane exclaimed . So Mach 's father appeared . It seemed that he had more money or power than any other Citizen , so could make his will felt most effectively . He married Sheen , the humanoid robot female ; this caused a furor . He required that the self-willed humanoid robots be granted serf status . Later he did the same for the most advanced humanoid androids , and for the humanoid cyborgs . Each such step was fought resolutely by the Contrary Citizens . Most recently he had done it for the aliens : those sapient creatures who could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equal intellectual and social basis . " Agape , " he murmured , understanding her position in this at last . The screen heard him . " Agape , " it said , showing a picture . " Sapient creature of Planet Moeba , first representative of this species participating in the Experimental Culture Project . " " I did n't mean to show her ; I was just commenting , " Bane said . The screen returned to its prior business , describing the things that Citizen Blue had initiated in the past twenty years in Proton . It was an impressive listing ; more changes had occurred in this period than in the prior two hundred years . The Experimental Culture Project was intended to enable the diverse types of sapient creatures to integrate their society without adverse pressures . Ordinary serfs were required to become the employees of individual Citizens at maturity , and were thereafter subject to the arbitrary will of those employers . The Experimentals had no such requirement ; they were considered to be the employees of Proton itself , with no requirements . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own section . When they went beyond it , they had to observe the normal forms , deferring in all things to Citizens , and not interfering with the activities of ordinary serfs . " But what is the point ? " Bane asked . He knew that idle rs  | would not survive long in Phaze , and doubted they would be tolerated long in Proton . " The point is to ascertain whether the diverse species can successfully integrate , " the screen replied . " If this is affirmative , the entire society will be similarly integrated . There will be no distinctions between species or types , only between serf-status and Citizen status . Machines and aliens will have equal access to the benefits of Proton society . " Bane nodded . This made sense to him . He would not have known how well unicorns and human beings could get along together , after centuries of noninvolvement with each other , if he had not known Neysa and Fleta . Now he was learning how pleasant it could be to know an alien creature . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , astonished . She was there , but her form was not . She had become a mound of dark jelly that spread across the bed like so much spilled pudding . Only its cohesion and continuing quiver distinguished it from inanimate substance . She really was an amoeba : a blob of protoplasm . Should he be revolted ? He decided not to be . He had seen Meta change to her natural unicorn form many times , and to her other hummingbird form , and back to girl form . That was interesting , not revolting ; why should this be different ? Agape had not concealed her nature from him , she had only tried to spare his feelings , because it seemed that other human beings had been upset by her true form . But he had come to know her mind and her personality , and he liked these . She was quite different from himself , physically ; what did it matter ? He had had enough of education for now . He asked the screen for entertainment , and was rewarded by a " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brightened and dimmed , radiated out and in , changed shape and color , and assumed odd and fleeting shapes . Sometimes Bane , the viewer , seemed to be flying into a rapidly expanding bank of clouds ; sometimes he seemed to be swimming in strange water . The configurations never repeated ; he kept being surprised by what happened next . Finally he told the screen to turn itself off . He walked about the room , rhinking , trying to assimilate all that he had learned .  | One impression came through strongly : he liked this frame of Proton , despite its appalling degradation of the wilderness outside the domes . It had more than enough scientific magic inside the domes to make up . True , it had serious problems  --  but those represented not so much a liability as a challenge . Citizen Blue , who had been reared in Phaze , seemed to be Bane 's own kind of man . It would have been nice to work with him to complete the necessary changes in the society . In time , perhaps , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become green again outside . Of course he had to return to his own frame , but he would always be glad to have had this experience in this one . Many hours had passed , but Agape still slept and he did not wish to disturb her . He experimented with his body , discovering that though in the rush of events he had not been aware of many differences between his own body and this one , those differences were significant . It was not just a matter of not getting tired and of not needing sleep ; his involuntary physical reactions had become voluntary . He could elevate his reactions at will , becoming keyed up or relaxed simply by so directing his body . He could make himself sexually excited instantly , and turn it off as readily . It was helpful to know , since it could have been embarrassing with Agape if he depended on natural reactions . At last he turned himself down to standby state , and this was very like sleep . He could , after all , have slept , had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to turn his body close to off for a period . An alarm jolted Bane out of his simulated sleep . " The Citizen will see you in ten minutes , " the voice of a serf came from the screen . " Uh , right , " Bane said . He turned to the bed . Agape was stirring ; evidently the alarm had awakened her toe . Already her protoplasm was changing its shape . Legs and arms grew out at the ends , and her head . None were well formed , they most resembled the appendages a child might tack on . t homemade doll . But once the size was right , the specific features developed . In just a few minutes she was herself  --  or rather , that artificially human form he had come to know . She sat up , gazing at him . " Now you have seen me as I truly am , " she said .  | " I think thou hast marvelous magic , " he said . " I could not change my form as thou dost . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am an Adept  --  or will be one , " he said . " I can change the forms of others , but not my own . " " You really are not disturbed ? " " I really am not , " he said . And now it was true ; the screen had provided him with the proper perspective , so that he understood the rationale of her nature and her presence , and approved of it . She was a nice person who was trying to accommodate herself to what was for her an alien situation . She needed support , not objection . She stood , then stepped up to him and kissed him . " I fear I will not encounter your like again , " she said sadly . " Nor I thine . " " Two minutes , " the screen announced . " Present yourselves at the exit to your chamber . " " We must not delay , " Agape said . " I have not been on Proton long , but I know from my briefing that serfs must always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I should talk , if it can be arranged . " " Aye . " They presented themselves at the exit . The wall opened . The serf conducted them quickly to a smaller chamber . They stepped in , but the serf did not . The door slid closed . Suddenly the four walls vanished . They were in an enormous room . They stood on a beach whose sand spread endlessly to either side . Not far behind were palm trees , their fronds shimmering in the breeze . Ahead crashed the restless breakers of the fringe of a mighty ocean . The stood staring , both awed by the scene . Then Agape put out her hand . " It is holo , " she murmured . " The walls still enclose us . " " Hold ? " " Pictures , like those on the screen you watched last night . Very realistic . " Bane touched the wall , verifying its presence . It seemed as if they were in an invisible box set on the beach , but he understood what she meant ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this be not magic , what need have Citizens for it ? " he asked .  | On the ocean appeared a sail , and the sail expanded . It showed up as a sailboat , blown quickly by the wind toward them . On the boat , operating it , was a ruddy , heavyset man . He guided it to the beach , then quickly furled the sail and dragged the small craft right up before the place where Bane and Agape stood . He lifted out a chest and set it on the sand . He brought out a key , put it to the big old-style lock , and unlocked it . He lifted the lid of the chest . From the chest rose a head . It kept rising , until a complete woman stood in the chest . There could not have been room for her within it . She seemed quite young , possibly fifteen , and her hair was as white as snow , set with a silver tiara . She wore a white gown set with bright gems . The woman glanced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Sir , " he said , " these are the refugees . " This was the Citizen ! Bane realized . He had expected an old man , not a young woman , but obviously Citizenship knew no age or sex . " Your identities ? " Citizen White inquired . " Agape of Moeba , " Agape said immediately . " And this is Mach , the son of Citizen Blue . Sir . " The woman frowned . " I think not , " she said . She stared at Bane . " Tell me your identity in your own words . " Somehow she knew about the exchange ! " I be Bane , son of the Blue Adept , also called Stile . " " And how came thee here ? " she inquired . For a moment Bane was too startled to speak . " Thou  --  thou knowest ? " She smiled . " How long since thou bast been to the White Demesnes ? " " The White Adept ! " he exclaimed . " But ? " " But she be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smile . She made a gesture , and abruptly she was old and fat . Then she reappeared in her young edition . " Since when be the son of an Adept deceived by appearances ? " " But there be no connection to Phaze ! " Bane cried . " 1 be the first in a score years to come to Proton , and that only in a body not mine own ! "  | " Really , " the woman said , smiling condescendingly . She turned to the serf beside her . " Set me adrift again , Grizzle , and open the window to Phaze for these two serfs . " " Sir ! " the man agreed . The Citizen lost height . She sank back into the chest . When her head disappeared , the serf closed the lid , locked the lock , and lifted the chest back into the sailboat . He turned back to Bane and Agape . " The floorsman will take you there , " he said . Then he dragged the boat back to the water , stepped into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wind . The scene vanished . They were back in the box . The door opened , and they stepped back into the hall . " This way , " the serf said . They followed him down the hall to another door . " You 'll need clothes , " he said , bringing out a white shirt and trousers of the Phaze variety for Bane and a white dress for Agape . " We do n't usually send others through , so white 's all we 've got . You can change them when you get where you 're going . " " But I am a serf ! " Agape protested . " I ca n't don clothing here ! " " We do wear it in Phaze , " Bane told her . " Thou wouldst be as out of place there naked as here in clothing . " " I suppose , " she agreed uncertainly . She got somewhat awkwardly into the dress and slippers provided . The serf helped her get her outfit adjusted , and in a moment she looked , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , bending to fit the shoes to his feet . They fit well enough . " This way , " the serf said , showing them on down the hall to still another door . They entered another cubicle . This one closed on them , then abruptly ascended , startling them . Its walls were transparent ; they ould see the dimly illuminated walls of the region through which it passed . I t came up into a forest . It halted at ground level , and the panel on one side opened . They stepped out onto the forest floor . The cubicle closed itself up and descended back into the ground ; a lid closed , making the ground complete . " This is ! Maze ? " Agape asked .  | " It seems like it , " Bane said . " It be hard to believe that return could be so simple ! " But I  --  I am not magical ! " she said . " How can I be here ? " " The same way I be here , " he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the robot body . We made a physical crossing ! " " All the time the Citizens knew this route ! " Agape said . " It was not your imagination ! " He glanced at her . She was very fetching in her dress ; it fitted her beautifully . " Thou didst doubt ? " She spread her hands . " I know that robots can be programmed and reprogrammed . They must believe what they are programmed to believe ; they can not do otherwise . I was sure that you believed , but not sure that you really came from Phaze . I apologize , Bane . " " Accepted , Agape ! " he said . " I could prove my origin not as readily as thou didst . " " If this really is your frame , where should we go ? I really do n't belong here . " " I think thou dost belong with me , " he said . " Thou didst help me wend my way through Proton ; now it be my turn to help thee in Phaze . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " And how glad I be that this be not our separation , Agape ! " She clung to him . " Oh , Bane , I told you I wanted to learn how your species indulges in sex , and I do , but I think that was only part of it . What I really want is to be close to you . I felt so alone , so  --  so alien when I came to Proton , and you have made me feel like a person . " " Thou hast made me feel wanted , " he said . And that , he realized , was the essence . He preferred to be genuinely wanted and needed by an alien creature , than to be routinely accepted by the most human of women . They walked through the forest . " This must be near the White Demesnes , " he said . " That would be northeast of the Blue De mesnes , and some distance away . I recognize this particular re religion not , but if we go southeast we 'll get home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said . " Thou dost not want it ? " he asked . " Oh , Bane , I am not your kind ! I have a task to accom plish ? "  | " But after thou dost accomplish it , and make thy report  --  what then ? " " Oh , Bane , I just do n't know ! This is all so sudden , so strange ! " " Meanwhile , come and meet my family , " he said . He looked at her appraisingly . " And let 's see how thou wouldst be in blue . " He paused , considering , then sang : " Turn me blue , and her too . " There was a flash , and abruptly both of their outfits were blue instead of white . Agape looked at him , and at herself , astonished . " Magic ! You did it ! " " I be an apprentice Adept , " he said . But privately he was bothered by a detail ; there had never before been a flash when he performed magic . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Suddenly there was a commotion to the side . Gnarly little men appeared , about half the size of Bane . " Goblins ! " he said . " They be usually trouble ! " " Are they human beings ? " Agape asked . " They seem so small ! " " They may be descended from human stock , but they be hardly human anymore . Mostly they interfere not with our kind , but they can be ugly on occasion . I want not to waste magic ; I 'll see if I can bluff them off . " The goblins charged up . " Fresh meat ! " they exclaimed , licking their twisted lips . " Back off , goblins ! " Bane cried . " Else I transform you all to worms for the birds ! " " And who dost thou think thou art ? " one of them challenged him . " I think I be the son of Blue , " Bane said . " Blue be far from here , " the goblin retorted . " We 'll roast thee and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worms , " Bane sang . " As birds want ? " " We 're going ! " the goblin cried , and all of them scurried back the way they had come . Agape was impressed . " Could you really have turned them to worms ? " " Methinks so ; I have tried to transform that many not simultaneously before , " Bane said . " My father could readily do it , of nurse . But we prefer to employ magic only as a last resort . " " Oh , why is that ? "  | " Because a given spell only works well once . I have to figure out a new one each time . So if I use magic when I do n't need to , I be cutting down my options for the future . That could make me pretty much impotent , later in life . " " Ah , now I understand ! " she exclaimed . " So life is not entirely easy , even with magic ! " " Not necessarily easy at all , " he agreed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He paused . " Speaking of which  --  the White Adept really has never been very friendly with the Blue Adept , not since the separation of frames . Why would she do us this big favor now ? " " Perhaps she is a nicer person than you thought . " He laughed . " Adepts are n't nice folk ! They are concerned only with their own powers . " Then he reconsidered . " No , some are all right . The Red Adept owes his position to my father , so he 's always friendly , and the Brown Adept 's all right too . She helped Fleta and the weres a lot . She 's the one who makes the golems . " " The golems ? " " They be like robots , " he said with a smile . " They look and act like men , but they be dead sticks . Generally . " They went on . " Mayhap I should conjure us directly there , " Bane said . " So thou dost not have to walk so far . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a smile . " I do n't mind walking with you . " They came to a mountain . There was a large cave visible at its base . " The vampires ! " Bane exclaimed . " Vampires ! The kind that suck blood ? " " They do , but not indiscriminately . It be part of special rituals they have for coming-of-age and such . We have nothing to fear from them . " He walked toward the cave-entrance . Agape followed , not at all at ease . A man in a gray cape stood guarding the cave , though hats wheeled in the sky nearby . He came alert as the two approached . " Who be ye ? " he challenged . " I be the son of Blue , " Bane said . " This be my friend , a shape changer . I come to see my friends . " " Who be thy friends ? " the man asked . " Vanneflay , " Bane said .  | " Sorry , he be away these three days . " " Vidselud , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Bane considered . " Then Suchevane . " The man shrugged . " That be a coincidence ! He , too . " " All away ? " Bane asked , surprised . " But thou'rt welcome to join us in a meal , " the guard said . " Any son of Blue be welcome here . " " Uh , Bane ? " Agape whispered uncomfortably . Bane smiled . " My friend be nervous about vampire viands . Thank thee , but we shall move on . " The guard made a negligent wave of his hand . They returned to the forest and walked on toward the west until they were well clear of the vampire 's mountain . Bane was deep in thought . " I 'm glad we did n't stay there ! " Agape said . " The thought of eating blood ? " " That bothers thee ? Is blood not easier to imbibe than solid food ? " " We do n't consume flesh , " she said . " Actually , the vampires would n't have offered us blood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it fresh . That is n't what bothers Inc . " " What bothers you , Bane ? " " This be not Phaze . " She halted in place . " What ? " " When I changed the color of our clothing , there was a flash . My magic ne'er did that . Be there a way science could have done it ? " " Changed the color ? Oh , yes ; some material is sensitive to certain types of radiation , so that when it flashes ? " " Methought so . And true goblins bluff not so readily ; must always destroy a few ere they give over . But mainly , the vampires . They were not . " " Rut the fact that we did not see them change form does not mean ? " " Oh , they might have changed form , by some device . But the friends I named ? " He shook his head .  | " But they really could be away , " she said . " The first , yes . But the second , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom my father did a favor . Vidselud be six or seven years my senior , but we be friends because with me he can safely travel . " " He ca n't with his own kind ? " " Nay . He has a problem with the assimilation of blood that crops up every so often . They keep a potion in the cave that cures it , and they never let that potion go out , because it can not be replaced . So he flies ne'er beyond walking distance of the cave , unless with me , because I can conjure him home if need be . " " But then he should be home ! " she said . " He should be home . Yet the guard said he was not . " " Still , that 's not proof ? " " And the third one , Suchevane . " " He could also be ? " " She , " Bane said succinctly . " Female ? But the guard said he ' ? " " Precisely . " " Maybe the guard forgot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " Agape looked sharply at him . " She is ? ? " " Almost as lovely as thee , in girl form . And still unmarried , when I left Phaze . If there be any male head doth not turn when she goes by , that head be blind . Even the werewolves howl fin her . " " But how , then ? " " No way , " Bane said with finality . " This can not be the vampire mountain I know , and since there be only one like this , these he other than vampires , and this be other than Phaze . " " But why would ? " A bat flew down from the sky . As it neared the ground , it changed abruptly into a beautiful woman . " Lovelier than P " she demanded . Bane gazed at her . " Nay . " Then , after a pause , " Sir . " The woman changed appearance , becoming the young-seen ) ing Citizen White , then a woman about twenty years older , still  | garbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , young man , " she said . " No , sir . " " It is true ; this is all a setting . I was able to make it authentic because when I was a child , I did visit Phaze , and knew the vampire colony . But in twenty years the personnel have evidently c hanged , and without contact , we can not change with them . " " True , sir , " Bane agreed . " So this is pretense , agreed . " She gazed hard at him . " But you are not . You really are from Phaze ; you have demonstrated that . " " But sir , why ? " Agape asked , disturbed . " Why bother to play such a cruel game with two serfs who intended you no harm ? " " That you are about to discover , " the Citizen said . She snapped her fingers , and the entire setting disappeared , leaving a large empty chamber . She smiled , and it was not a pretty smile . " I think we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessarily , " Citizen White said . But the cruel lines that manifested about her mouth gave her words the lie .  | How much time passed Mach could not be sure , but it seemed to him that the sun had shifted in the sky by the time he emerged from his embrace with Fleta . " I suppose we should be on our way , " he said . " I can carry thee anywhere , rapidly , " she said . " Now that thou dost know my nature . " " I would prefer to go slowly , " he said . " My natural form pleases thee not ? " " If you take me to the Blue Demesnes quickly , I shall have little further time with you . Let 's walk . " " Oh . " She smiled . " Mayhap it will take two days to get there . " " I wish it were two years , " he murmured . " Sirrah ? " " Nothing . Of course we must go . " " Of course , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the path . " He liked the notion of camping out with her . They started out on the east path , the one they had not taken  | before . They made decent progress , and as night approached Mach judged they were parallel to the spot they had been on the Lattice . Had he realized that the demons would be roused , or what they were like ? ! " Methinks we should camp now , " Fleta said . " But there be something odd about the way the demons came at us . Best I check around ere we sleep . " " But you 've been walking all day ! " he protested . She smiled . " In other form , an thou have no objection . " " Oh . Of course . " As the unicorn , she could of course range far more widely before it got dark . She vanished  --  but the black unicorn did not appear . Mach blinked . There was a hummingbird , hovering in place . Just like the one who had helped him cross @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he exclaimed . " Another form ! " The hummingbird buzzed one loop around his head , then took off to the north . Mach shook his head , bemused . He had never made the connection ! Fleta had three forms , not two , and the bird was the third . She had assumed the flying form when that was needed to draw the thread across for the rope ladder over the river , then returned to her human form . Of course she had n't told him , because she was doubtful about his reaction to shape-changing women . But now that he knew her nature , she changed freely and openly . And now that he knew her nature , he discovered that he liked it . In Proton he had associated with human beings , and with robots , and cyborgs and androids of either sex , thinking nothing of it . Even , briefly , an alien creature . All had looked human , but their internal operation had been entirely different , and he had known that and accepted it . Fleta 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person  --  and it was the person that counted . Was she called an animal ? If so , he liked the animal better than the pseudopeople he had known in the other frame ! What , after all , was he ? A machine ! Who was he to quibble at whether a person was technically human , when he himself was not ? At the moment he occupied a human body , and its chemistry  | was wreaking havoc with his emotional control , but in essence he knew he remained a robot . If Fleta could accept that , he could accept her . He plucked fruit from the tree they had stopped at . He did n't recognize the type , but it seemed to be juicy and sweet , and his living appetite thrived on that sort of thing . What did Fleta prefer to eat , really ? Since her natural form was equine , did she usually graze ? If so , she must be getting hungry by now . He would have to ask . The hummingbird returned . Suddenly Fleta stood before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said breathlessly . " More trouble ? " He knew she was n't joking . " There be goblins lying in ambush to the north . " " Goblins ? Little men ? " She frowned . " The Little Folk be decent ; they mostly mine and work their crafts . Goblins be something else . " " Why would they be lurking in ambush ? " " Methought it coincidence that the rope ladder was wrong . And that the demons were roused . Now do I wonder . " " You mean those were traps laid for us ? But why ? " She shook her head . " I know not why . But I fear it . " " Maybe they 're just three types of mean creatures who like to eat human flesh ? " " They knew my nature . " " Then they must have known they could n't possibly catch you ! That you could change form and fly away . " " Aye , " she agreed pensively . His logical mind began to work . " Then it must have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Yet you helped me escape  --  and they must have known that you would . " " Not in human form . " " They wanted to force you to reveal your nature to me ? " I lc smiled . " In that they were successful  --  but what did they gain ? " " Mayhap they hoped thou wouldst revile me , when thou knew , so that I would leave thee . " " And then they could trap me without hindrance ! " he ( on  | Iuded . " Yet they could n't know I am not Bane . Surely they could not attack him with impunity ! " She laughed . " Goblins attack an Adept ? That be so funny it be no longer funny . " " So what could they expect to gain ? As far as they know , we 're both poison . " " That be what dost bother me . It makes not sense . " " Unless , " he continued slowly , " they somehow know my nature . That I am no magician @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Bane be an apprentice Adept . " " Whatever . My status makes me vulnerable . But how would they know ? And why would they go to all that effort for one morsel ? " " Methinks they tried not to slaughter thee , but to capture thee , " she said . " The talons o ' the harpies be poison , but they scratched thee not . And the demons grabbed but did not bite . " " And why would three different types of creatures try it ? They ca n't be working together , can they ? " " Nay . Not unless . . . " She trailed off . " Unless what ? I think we had better explore this . " " Unless there be Adept involvement , " she said reluctantly . " Are n't we going to see an Adept ? " " Stile be but one Adept . There be others , less friendly . " " What would an Adept want with me ? I 'm of no value to anyone here , and of not much value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have value . " " That , too , I must question . You are a lovely creature , in whatever form , and you know the ways of Phaze . But I am an impostor without much talent here . I do n't see how I can be worth much to you . " She shrugged . " Fain would I have been closer to Bane , but ne'er could that be . Now hast thou his likeness , and ? 0 , I know I he a foolish creature , but I be smitten with thee . " Mach did not care to argue with that . " So there is something we do n't yet understand , here . Unless they realize that I do n't have Bane 's proper powers , so they want to eliminate me , and then he could never return . If there are other Adepts who do n't like Stile , this could he a good way to get back at him . "  | She nodded . " To strike when the enemy be weak . " " But if another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Why not just take me out with a spell ? " " Methinks that would be too open . If Stile knew an Adept had done it ? " She shuddered . " If Stile be not the strongest Adept in Phaze , it be Red  --  and Red be friend to Stile . " " But if a harpy or a demon or a goblin did it , Stile might not suspect . If one of those groups took me captive and hid me somewhere , or delivered me secretly to an Adept , perhaps as a hostage ? " Mach nodded . " I think we have it , now . They have been ambushing us along the route to Stile 's demesnes. " " 0 , Mach ! " she cried . " If there be Adepts behind this , we be in trouble indeed ! No creature can withstand the power of an Adept except another Adept . " Mach nodded . " I think we ca n't afford to continue heading for the Blue Demesnes ; they 'll catch us for sure . But where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If they be Adepts ' gainst us , must we gain the protection of an Adept . But surely they will watch , and if we head for the Red Adept ? " " They will trap us on the way , " Mach finished . " Anyone else ? whom they might not suspect ? " " There be the Brown Adept , she of the golems . She might understand thee better than some . " " But if the others spied us heading for her ? " " Another ambush , " she agreed . " Suppose we took a circuitous route  --  one no one with any sense would take ? " " Such as through the Dragon Demesnes ? " Mach swallowed . " Yes . " " That would fool friend and foe alike . " They looked at each other , and nodded . Then they hugged each other , with joy or grief or something in between . " I suppose we ca n't rest now , " Mach said regretfully . " They 'll be coming down the path to check on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I can carry thee . " " And tire yourself further ? No , I 'll walk . Maybe we can hide somewhere unexpected . "  | She nodded . Silently she pointed west . " But that 's right toward the ? ! " he exclaimed . But then he understood : that was the least likely direction for them to go . Toward the site of their last ambush . They walked , this time stepping carefully so as to avoid leaving a trail . When darkness finally made progress impossible , they cast about for a suitable camping spot . The best that offered was a tree with thick foliage and a large fork some distance up that seemed to be well shrouded by the leaves . " There , " Fleta said , pointing to it . " Me ? But I think there 's only room for one of us ! " " I have another errand , " she whispered . " Oh  --  privacy ? " " A false trail . " Smart notion ! So he climbed the tree and lodged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaving a trail that could be traced and did not end at the tree . He hoped she would return soon , though he still did not see how she could join him here . Then he heard the hum of the hummingbird . She was back ! The bird perched on a nearby twig and tucked her head under her wing . She had a good place after all ! Mach sighed . He could not argue with the sense of it , but somehow he had wished he could be with her in her human form , and not too much clothing . He resigned himself to the inevitable , and slept . In the morning he descended . Fleta flew down and transformed to girl form . " Didst thou have a comfy night ? " she inquired brightly . " Are n't you getting hungry ? You have n't had much chance to graze . " She laughed . " I found nectar in flowers along the way as I flew . " " Rut that could only sustain a hummingbird ! What of the unicorn ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food for that form suffices . " YOU mean you can run all day as a unicorn , and sustain yourself with a hummingbird meal ? "  | " Aye . That be part of the magic . " " Magic indeed ! " But it did make sense in its fashion . He ate some more fruit , which was marvelously sustaining . Of course he had the advantage of Fleta 's advice ; she pointed out what was best , and what was worst , saving him much mischief . Then they resumed their trek . There was no sign of pursuit , but they continued to step carefully and to keep their voices low . There was no way to hide securely from Adept perception , Fleta advised him , but goblins and demons were fallible . They skirted the southern reaches of the Lattice , and no demons appeared . This gamble had been won : once the prey escaped , the demons had returned to their nether reaches , not bothering to keep watch . But there would be a lookout at the jump-sites ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not to travel . At noon they paused for lunch , and this time Fleta did change to unicorn form and grazed for an hour . Mach watched her , admiring her glossy black coat and golden hind-socks and gleaming spiraled horn . " Sometime you must play your horn for me , " he said . She heard him , and played a brief pan-pipes double melody . " A tune ! " he exclaimed . " You can play a tune ! " She looked at him questioningly . In her unicorn form she did not speak ; her mouth was not right for it . " I mean , I heard you play a chord , back in the swamp , but I thought that was all . To actually play a tune ? ! " She came in and changed to girl form . " All my kind play music , " she explained . " My dam , Neysa , plays a harmonica , as thy kind call it ; I play pan-pipes , or so Bane said . My sire played the accordion . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he exclaimed . Then paused . " Oops  --  I did n't mean to ? " " We are animals , " she said . " An ye mean it not as affront , say it freely . " That helped . He had indeed used the term in a less comhli mentary sense , back in the crater , when she had objected . " Why did n't you decide to go the other way , and intercept  | your Herd ? " he asked . " The goblins would not have followed there , would they ? " She sighed . " There be a matter I did not explain to thee , " she said . " My sire retired some fifteen years ago , and my uncle Clip assumed mastery o ' the Herd . That concerned not my dam , Neysa , his sibling , because she no longer marched with the Herd . She stayed at the Blue Demesnes . " " Why should your mother be concerned about her brother getting promoted ? " " It be the Herd Stallion who breeds all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closely related ! " " Aye . And I be too . So it became needful , as I came of age , to seek another herd . I was on that mission when I heard thy cry for help in the swamp . " " What a coincidence ! " Mach exclaimed . " I 'm glad I arrived at the right time ! I would have been roach-food otherwise ! " " Nay , I was near throughout . I  --  I knew Bane was going often to the glade , and I hoped to see him again , yet hesitated to intrude , an he be on Adept business . " " So you just sort of stayed in the vicinity for a while , " Mach said . " Understandable . How long were you there ? " She murmured something . " What was that ? I did n't hear . " " A fortnight , " she said , somewhat less faintly . " Two weeks ? Just in the hope he might decide he wanted to see you ? " " Aye , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on him ! " Then Mach regretted his choice of words . " I mean ? " " Thy meaning be clear , " she said , blushing . " And so you rescued me , thinking I was him . And stayed with me , because you liked him . " She nodded , looking uncomfortable . " Oh , Fleta  --  I 'm sorry ! Without ever knowing it , I brought you so much mischief ! " " Nay , Mach . Thou didst bring me joy . " " But you know I am not the man Bane is  --  not here in Phaze ! Without your help , I 'd have been lost many times over . I 'd still  | be lost without you ! Bane would have been no burden to you at all ! " " Aye , he needed me not , " she agreed . He looked at her , slowly understanding . " You need  --  to be needed . " Then he took her in his arms again and kissed her . But after a bit another thought occurred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other herd ! " " Aye , " she said . " And now I am keeping you from it . This really is not fair . " " I wanted to join the other herd not really that much , " she confessed . " Better to roam free , as my dam did , before my time . " " Well , you are welcome to my company as long as you like it , " he said . " I 'm in no position to refuse it , even if I wanted to . " There was a spot in the sky to the east . Fleta looked nervously at it . " Mayhap just a bird , " she said . " But if a harpy ? " " On a search-pattern for us , " he agreed . " Where can I hide ? " They were in open meadow ; there was not even a substantial tree nearby . " Take my socks , " she said . " Your socks ? " " Take them , " she repeated urgently as the flying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But Fleta , that 's just the color of your fur on your hind feet ! No way ? " She fluted at him . Mach shrugged and squatted to touch her hind leg . To his surprise he discovered that the golden color did come off ; in a moment he held two bright socks , and Fleta 's legs were black . Fleta resumed human form . " Put them on , quickly . " Mach put them on over his shoes . And stood astonished . His body changed . He now seemed to be a golden animal . A horse  --  or a unicorn . He could see illusory hindquarters behind him , and suspected that his head resembled that of a horse with a horn . " Graze , " Fleta whispered , and changed back to equine form herself . Mach leaned forward , trying to get his illusory head into the proper position for grazing . Evidently his performance was sat isfactory , for Fleta did not correct him .  | The flying form turned out to be a large bird , perhaps a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ False alarm , perhaps , but Mach was glad they had n't taken the chance . If the Adepts interrogated the bird , all they would get was a report of two unicorns grazing in the field . Meanwhile he had learned another thing about his fascinating companion ! Fleta changed back to girl form . " It was nothing , I think , " she said . " But here we be dawdling when we should be traveling . Methinks I must carry thee , to make the distance . " " But I do n't want to burden you ? " " An we get spotted , how much greater a burden ! " she exclaimed . She changed into unicorn form . Mach realized that she was correct . Quickly he removed his socks and put them back on her feet ; then he mounted her . She started walking , then trotting , then galloping . Now they were moving like the wind , covering the ground far more rapidly than they had . She headed straight southwest , angling toward the distant purple mountain range . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began to play on her horn , a lovely tune whose cadence was set by the beat of her falling hooves . Mach , delighted , picked up the melody and hummed along with her . His father was musical , and music was part of the Game , so Mach had trained on a number of instruments and learned to sing well . He had perfect pitch and tone as clear as an instrument could render it , being a machine himself , but it was more than that . Through music he could come closest to the illusion of life and true feeling . Now , of course , he really was alive , and this body had a power of voice almost as good as his own . So he hummed , first matching Fleta 's tune , then developing counterpoint , and it seemed to facilitate her running . Unicorns , he realized , were made to play while moving . He knew that their combined melody was a kind of a work of art , for Fleta was very good and so was he . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their traveling . An hour passed , and still she ran at a pace no horse could have maintained . Her music became less pretty , more determined . 1 Ier body became warm , but she did not sweat . Instead , he noted with surprise , her hooves got hot . Sparks flew from them when they touched the hard ground . She was dissipating heat through her hooves !  | As evening closed , they were near the great mountains . Now at last Fleta slowed . Mach could tell from the way her body moved that she was extremely tired ; she had covered a distance of perhaps three hundred kilometers in short order without respite . Her melody had faded out , the energy it expended now required for her running . Finally she stopped , and he jumped off , sore of arm , leg and crotch . He had learned bareback riding for the Game , but never this extreme ! They were near a grove of fruit trees , probably by no accident . " Rest , Fleta ! " he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't argue . She went under a tree , changed to girl form , and threw herself down as if unconscious . Mach collected fruits and located a nearby spring . This was an ideal location ! Then he heard something . He flattened himself against a tree . It turned out to be a party of what he took to be goblins . They were like gnarled little men , about half his own height , with huge and ugly heads , and correspondingly distorted hands and feet . " Damn nuisance ! " one was muttering as they passed , traveling a faint forest trail . " No unicorns here ! " " But we 've got to check anyway , " another said . The six of them trekked on . They had n't spotted Mach ; they had n't really been looking . This was just a pointless assignment to them ; evidently they had n't been told the reason for it . Mach relaxed . " Hey , I see something ! " one exclaimed . Mach 's living heart seemed to catapult to a crash-landing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they were hurrying away from him . He started to relax again . " A doll ! " a goblin cried . They had spied Fleta ! " A damn nymph ! " another exclaimed . " Sleepin ' by a tree . " " Well , let 's have at her ! Anything like that we catch ? " " That 's no nymph , " another said . " See the horn-button in her forehead ? That 's a unicorn ! " Fleta woke . She tried to scramble to her feet , but they were  | upon her , grabbing at her arms and legs . " Hold her horn ! " the leader cried . " So she ca n't change form ! " A goblin clapped a calloused hand on Fleta 's forehead , covering the horn-button . The others virtually wrapped themselves around her limbs , one to each . She struggled , but she was still very tired and they overwhelmed her . Mach had noted all this as if detached ; meanwhile he was charging to the rescue , drawing his axe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not see him . " Now , mare , tell us where the man is , or we 'll take turns raping you , " the leader said , yanking her cloak up . " You animals do n't like that much , do you ! " Fleta 's forehead was covered , but not her eyes . She saw Mach charging in . " No ! " she cried . " Not that way ! " But Mach was already committed . His axe swung down at the goblin-leader 's head . The goblin turned , but too late ; the axe chopped into his face , slicing off his nose . The goblins were no cowards . They let Fleta go and pounced as one on Mach . Before he could get in a second blow , four of them were on his arms and legs . They had surprising power ; they bore him back and down , spread-eagling him on the ground . The goblin leader , amazingly , retained his feet . His nose was gone , but he seemed otherwise unbothered . " That be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seek ! " Mach struggled , but the goblins were too strong for him . Now he understood why Fleta had tried to warn him off . She had known he could not handle these creatures . Who would have thought that monster 's skull could be so hard as to make the axe sheer off ! For Mach knew he had scored directly on the goblin 's forehead ; had it been fashioned of ordinary stuff , the stone blade would have cut right in . Instead it had been turned aside by the super-hard bone , doing what was apparently only minor damage to the goblin 's face . How could an ordinary man fight such crea-tures ' ' Tie him up , " the leader said . " I 'd love to chew up his eyeballs , but orders are orders . The Adept wants him intact . We 'll have to content ourselves with the animal . " He looked about with sudden alarm . " Who 's holding her ? ' .. '  | " I am ! " the sixth goblin cried . But though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his touch nullifying the magic power of her horn , he was now the only one . Fleta 's arms and legs were free , because the other four goblins were now holding Mach . Fleta smiled . She reached up and grabbed the goblin 's hands in her own , hauling them down while she straightened up . He might be stronger than she , but he could not keep his hands in place while she was moving her body . He needed more hands . In a moment her forehead was clear . Abruptly she vanished . In her place was the hummingbird , and its buzz was quite angry . It darted at the goblin leader . One of the goblins holding Mach began to laugh , for such a tiny creature could hardly hurt a goblin . But the laugh was cut off when the unicorn manifested almost in the leader 's face . The forward motion of the bird translated into a plunge by the unicorn . The long horn speared right through the goblin 's head . Then Fleta lifted her head and flung the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ones holding Mach , but these were already scrambling desperately away . Their skulls might be too tough for Mach 's crude axe , but the unicorn 's horn was another matter ! In a moment there was not a live goblin in sight . Fleta fluted , blood spitting from her horn as she blew it . She stood by Mach , angling her head . He needed no further urging . He scrambled to her back , and they were off . It was obvious that the goblins would soon spread the news of the discovery of the prey , and greater numbers of them would be in hot pursuit . He hated to make Fleta run again , when she had had so little rest , but they had to find a better place to hide . Where was there ? If the goblins roamed this forest , that was no good . But out in the open the harpies would be able to spot them . It was getting dark now , but what of the morning ? Fleta was pounding directly south , toward the looming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew what she was doing . But he could feel the fatigue of her body ; she should n't be running at all , right now ! Well , he could do nothing about it at the moment . He just had to hang on and hope it would he all right .  | Meanwhile , he realized that he had learned some new things . A unicorn could n't change form if her horn was covered ; thus she could be held captive , or even raped , despite her normal powers . So if they were ever in a situation like this again , his first job would be to eliminate whoever was holding her horn , so as to free her magic . That was the way he should have proceeded before , had he but known . He could have thrown himself upon the goblin at her head , dragging it off for that necessary instant . But also , the goblins had confirmed that it was an Adept behind this . And that it was Bane 's presence , not his death , that was wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bane during his weakness was wrong ; the Adept wanted something else . What could the Adept want ? Mach was simply not very effective as a resident of Phaze ! Without Fleta he 'd have been dead several times over already . He was learning to do magic , but even that was only a poor suggestion of what Bane could do . He would n't be worth much even as a hostage , since he was the wrong person . He shook his head . He just could n't make much sense of it . But he was sure he did n't want to get hauled in to that enemy Adept ! Fleta slowed . He feared it was because she was exhausted , but he discovered it was the terrain ; the level plain had ended , and the slope of the mountain range was beginning . " I 'll walk now ! " he said quickly . " You 've done enough ! " She did not object . Mach slid off . It was now dark , except for the light of three moons . Proton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too , and several were normally in view . Most were pale shades of gray ; the one blue moon seldom showed . She changed to girl form , showing the way up the mountain slope . Mach was amazed by the amount she evidently knew of far-flung terrain . She must have done a lot of exploring in her day ! He followed , covertly admiring her rear view , though he knew that her human shape was exactly what she had chosen and crafted ; naturally she had not devised an ugly one . Then she stumbled . Mach hastened to join her , putting his arm about her waist . But she sagged , too tired to keep her feet . " The hummingbird ! " he exclaimed . " Change to that form ! "  | " Nay , " she whispered . " It takes more energy to fly than this ! " " Not to fly , " he said . " To perch ! You carried me ; let me carry you , now ! " She turned her head to him . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hand , and she flopped in it . He lifted her to his shoulder , and there she perched , her little claws anchored on his homemade shirt . " Sleep , Fleta , " he said . " I will climb this hill . " Climb he did . It made him feel good to do his part , his strength filling in for hers . His legs were stiff , but he had plenty of remaining energy . As the way became steeper , he hauled himself up by grabbing handholds on saplings . He hoped he got them wherever they were going . It was so dark now that he could barely see the next tree before him . There was an angry squawk from ahead . Startled , Mach paused . " Who the hell art thou ? " a voice screeched . " Stay out o ' my bower ! " " A harpy ! " Mach exclaimed with dismay . He gripped his axe . Fleta , on his shoulder , was so tired that she did n't wake . " What didst thou @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , " Mach said . Could he escape her surveillance in the darkness , or were they in for another horrible chase ? The harpy laughed raucously . " Well , no such luck ! Come not near me , lest thou catch the tailfeather itch ! " Mach knew he should shut up and hide , but something nagged at him . Why was this foul creature talking instead of attacking or summoning her cohorts ? " I 'm just a weary traveler , " he said . " I have no tailfeathers to itch , but I will detour around your bower . I apologize for bothering you . " " Thou dost what ? " she screeched . " I apologize for bothering you , " Mach repeated . " Nobody doth apologize to a harpy ! " " I do n't want any trouble , I just want to get somewhere where I can rest for the night . " " Thou dost speak strangely . Who be ye ? " " I am called Mach . " If she knew his identity , his name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " What kind of monster be a rovot ? " she demanded .  | " One that looks like a human being . " " Oh , hell , come into my bower , " she said . " I be lonely for company . Stranger yet ! Was it a trap ? Well , might as well spring it as have it pursue him . Mach climbed forward . He parted a thick curtain of leaves and came into a snug chamber padded with ferns . There was a tiny bit of glow , so that he could ascertain its approximate size and see the form perched on a stick at one side . This was the harpy . " Why , thou dost be a man ! " she exclaimed . " I said I looked like a human being . " " Aye , that be true . And a bird on thy shoulder . " " My companion . " Fleta was stirring now ; what would she think of this interview ? ' " I be Phoebe , " the harpy said . Mach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bird of that name . Nondescript , except that it wags its tail . " " Aye , that be why the name , " she agreed . She rustled about as if to make the point . " But it be uncomfortable as hell , and not just in the feathers . " " You really do have a tailfeather itch ? " " Aye , and no cure , so I be exiled from my kind . " " You mean you 're not part of the pursuit ? " " What pursuit ? " Phoebe demanded . " We 've been chased by harpies , demons and goblins , " Mach said . " We do n't know why . " " I know naught o ' that ! I 've had no contact with my kind in a year . " Could he believe that ! Or was she just trying to lull him while others closed in ? " No offense  --  but you do n't smell . The other harpies I en-countered ? " " I wash my feathers daily to keep down the itch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " An ' another o ' my kind come near , it will spread . That be my curse . " Fleta jumped off his shoulder , then materialized as her girl form . " Know thou my nature ? " she asked the harpy . " A werebird ! Ne'cr saw I the like before ! "  | " Nay . Unicorn . " " And thou comest to roust me out o ' my bower ? For shame , ' corn ; I have no quarrel with thee ! " " Willst swear so on my horn ? " " For sure , an thou attack me not . " Fleta parted the leaves of the bower wall and stepped out . The harpy peered after her . She shrugged with her wings . " Hell , trust must begin somewhere , and I have no life worth living alone . " She half-spread her wings and hopped out after Fleta . Mach followed her out , not certain what was happening . Outside , he could just make out the dark unicorn shape . Fleta lowered her horn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horn touched her feathers . " I swear I have no quarrel with thee , " the harpy said . Fleta fluted . " What , turn about ? " Phoebe asked , evidently understanding her . " What for ? " Fleta played several notes . " That ? " the harpy asked incredulously . " Thou wouldst ? " An affirmative note . Mach tried to fathom what this was about , but it baffled him . The harpy turned about , and Fleta put her horn to the creature 's tailfeathers . For a moment there seemed to be a kind of radiance , but Mach could not be sure . " Mine itch ! " the harpy cried . " Gone ! " Fleta returned to girl form . " Grant us rest in thy bower for a day , and all 's repaid , " she said . " For this cure ? " Phoebe cried . " Thou canst stay a year ! " Fleta made her way back into the bower and curled up on the fern . In a moment she was asleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had no quarrel with you ? " he asked the harpy . " ' Corns be stubborn beasts , " Phoebe said . " They betray not who betrays them not . " " And she cured you  --  just like that ? " " Aye , the horn has power , an there he ailment . But for ' corn to cure harpy  --  that be rare indeed . "  | " We were looking for a place to rest in safety , " Mach said . " Ye have it now . " Phoebe wiggled her tail , appreciating the lack of itch . Mach went in and lay down beside Fleta . It seemed that his willingness to talk with the harpy had paid off ; she was not after all an enemy . In a moment he slept . Fleta slept all night and much of the following day . It was evident that she had seriously depleted her resources in the long run . Mach , less tired , found himself talking with Phoebe . The harpy brought fresh fruit and edible roots , but urged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wash , but my talons form the poison , and it gets on what I touch , " she explained . Mach was happy to wash the food . " There be my sisters in the sky , and goblins o'er the plain , " Phoebe announced after taking a flight . " An thou knowest not why they seek ye ? " " An Adept sent them , " Mach said . " He wants me alive ; he does n't care about Fleta . She carried me from the Lattice in a day . " In a single day ? Lucky thou art she died not on the hoof ! " " She 's a good creature , " Mach agreed . " And for the love o ' thee ! " She shook her head . She was as awkwardly endowed as all her kind , with a human head and breasts and the wings and hind parts of a vulture . Her face was lined and her breasts sagged ; her hair was a wild tangle . About the only pretty part of her was her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was harsh , sounding like a screech even when she talked normally . Mach could see that if she had behaved the way the others of her kind did , allowing filth to encrust her body , she would have been monstrously ugly ; as it was , she was merely homely . " My kind has no such love . " " If I may ask  --  just how does your kind reproduce ? I understand there are no males of your species . " " Aye , there be none . We lay eggs and leave them scattered about ; an one survive the animals long enough to hatch , an the chick not get consumed , she grows to size and lays her own eggs . Legend has it that only a fertilized egg can hatch a male harpy ?  | but only a male of our species can fertilize it . So it be an endless circle . We be chronically bitter about that , and take it out on all creatures . " She sighed . " Sometimes I wish it were otherwise . But what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't know . It does seem a tragedy . But why did n't you revile me when I showed up in the night ? " " I should have , I know , " she confessed . " But after a year denied the company of mine own kind , awful as that be , I was lonely . So I was foolish . " " And got your tail fixed . " " It passeth all understanding . " " Phoebe  --  are harpies supposed to be ugly ? " " What point to be other ? " " If you get lonely , you are more likely to find company of any kind if you look nice . " She laughed with her raucous cackle . " What a notion ! " " Why do n't you let me do some work on your hair , and see what happens ? " " Thou canst not make me beautiful , " she said . " That would take the magic o ' an Adept ! " " I 'm just curious . " She shrugged . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thy company . Play with my hair , an thou wishest . " " I need a comb . " Mach looked about . He found a piece of a fish bone with a few ragged spikes . He pondered . Then he sang : " Give this home one big comb . " The fish bone shimmered , and became a huge mass of wax and honey . The stuff dripped from his hand . " A honeycomb ! " Phoebe screeched , snatching it out of his hand . In a moment she was gobbling it , getting it all over her face and in her hair . Then she paused . " Oops , my harpy manner o'ercame me . Didst conjure it for thyself ? " " No , welcome to it , " Mach said . " I wanted a hair comb . " " Check in my purse . Mayhap there be a comb there . " Harpies had purses ? Mach found her handbag and sorted through it . It contained several colored stones , a moldy piece of bread , a dozen acorns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a number of prune pits , a fragment of a mirror , the skeleton of a small snake , three pottery sherds  --  and a fine old comb .  | " But we 'll have to get the honey out , " he decided . " Can you wash your hair ? " " Aye , it be time for another dunking anyway , " she said . She licked off her claws  --  evidently the poison did n't affect her own system  --  and launched herself clumsily into the air . She flapped toward the spring , folded her wings , and dive-bombed into it . So that was how she bathed ! Mach and Fleta had drunk from that spring in the morning . Suddenly he felt queasy . Phoebe emerged . For a moment , with just her head and bosom showing above the surface , she looked distinctly human . Then she spread her wings , and clambered into the air , and the effect was gone . She came to a crash-landing beside him , spattering water on him . " I be clean now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the spring ? Mach took the comb and began working on her hair . There were tangles galore , so the job was tediously slow , but he did n't have anything better to do while waiting for Fleta to recover . Gradually the hair straightened , and as it did so , drying , it began to assume some of the metallic luster of the wings . Small iridescent highlights glinted as the sunlight struck it . " Thou didst conjure that honeycomb ! " Phoebe exclaimed , belatedly realizing what he had done . " I tried to conjure a comb , " he reminded her . " I always mess it up . " " But then thou canst do magic ! " " Not a fraction as well as the one whose body I 'm using . As a magician I 'm a dunce . " " But to do any magic , aside from that of werecreatures and the like  --  that be special ! " " Well , my other self is an apprentice Adept . " She drew away from him , shocked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't worry . I 'm not an Adept ! I 'm just a clumsy imitation . " " But that must be why they seek thee ! One who dost do clumsy magic today , may be Adept tomorrow . " Mach paused . " Do you think so ? " " What else ? They know they must abolish thee today , else thou willst abolish them another time . "  | " But they want to capture me . Why not just kill me ? " She shrugged with her wings . " I know not . But thou dost be nothing ordinary , an thou canst conjure . " " Maybe I should save myself time and conjure your hair combed . " " Mayhap . Combing a harpy 's hair be a thankless task , methinks . " Mach pondered . Then he hummed to try to intensify the magic , and sang : " Make this hair beyond compare . " A cloud formed about her head ; then it cleared and her hair was revealed . It was an absolute fright-wig . Spikes of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a gross sea urchin . " I think I botched it again , " Mach groaned . Phoebe flopped over to her purse and snatched up the fragment of mirror . She peered at herself . " 0 , lovely ! " she screeched . " I adore it ! " Mach was taken aback . " You like it ? " " I 'm beautiful ! I ne'er thought it possible ! " And , amazingly , as she straightened up in admiration of herself , the lines in her face eased and her breasts firmed . She did indeed seem to be a fairly handsome half-specimen of womanhood . Mach decided to leave well enough alone . He returned to the bower and settled down for another nap . By the following morning they were ready to resume traveling . The search in sky and on land seemed to have abated ; it was now safer to be out . They thanked Phoebe for her hospitality . " Ah , it be the two of ye must I thank , " the harpy screeched . " The one did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She scrambled for her purse and drew out one of the feathers . " An ye need my presence , burn this feather . I will smell it and come , where'er ye may be . " " Thank thee , Phoebe , " Fleta said graciously , tucking the feather into her cloak . They headed on up the steepening slope . Now it was faster going , because it was daylight and Fleta was rested and back to her normal self . Indeed , she seemed brighter than ever , almost effervescent ; Mach had to scramble to keep up with her . By noon they had reached the crest of the mountain  --  which  | turned out to be a mere foothill ; the real range was farther south . They paused for food , finding plentiful fruits . " I 'm amazed that there is so much to eat in Phaze ! " Mach exclaimed . " Everywhere we go , there are more fruit trees . " Fleta snorted , sounding in that moment very much like a unicorn though she remained in human form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it be that I sniff them out as we travel . " " Oh . Well , I always knew I had some reason to travel with you . She laughed , then turned sober . " There be a problem soon upon me , " she said . " I fear I must leave thee for a time . " " Leave me ! " But immediately he regrouped his emotion . " Of course there is no requirement that you remain with me , Fleta . I never meant to hold you from your ? " " It be not that I want to leave thee , " she said . " But I think it may be best . " " Best ? Why ? " She opened her mouth as though planning to speak , but could not formulate the sentence . " Let me explore , " she said after a moment . She shifted to hummingbird form and buzzed off . Mach stared after her . What was the problem ? She had seemed so vigorous and cheerful during the climb , completely recovered from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no evidence of pursuit at the moment . Why should she have to leave him now , if she did n't want to ? He ate his fruit and rested , admiring the countryside . She would surely tell him in due course , and meanwhile this was about as nice a region as he could imagine . He had never had physical experience with either mountains or forests before , there being only bolo representations of such things in the dome-cities of Proton , and he liked them very well . The hill sloped gradually down to the south , and then the nearest segment of the Purple Mountain range heaved up to an extraordinary elevation , the highest peak spearing a cloud and anchoring it so that it could not drift away . Actually , it was n't just the terrain that exhilarated him , he realized . It was the living body . He had discovered that eating was not the nuisance he had imagined it to be , when in robot body ; it was a pleasure . In Proton , as a robot , he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his survival ; here it was a glorious perception . Even the complication of periodic elimination was not really bothersome , once he knew how to handle it expeditiously . The rest of it was wonderful : the feel of the wind against his skin , the pleasure of healthy exertion , the sheer satisfaction of slaking thirst . The act of living was a dynamic experience . Fleta returned and changed to girl form . " There be a good path ahead , " she reported . " There be a dragon to the east , but it moves not from its stream ; an we steer clear o ' that , no problem . " Mach looked at her . " What about this matter of ? " he began , but then sheered off , deciding not to press the mystery of her need to leave him . " Clothing ? How is it that you have no clothing in animal form , yet do now ? Where does it go when you change ? " She laughed with a certain relief , as if she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mystery , Mach ! I wear clothing in all three forms . In one it be called feathers , and in another , hair . " So simple an answer ! And it seemed that anything she carried with her in human form she carried with her in animal form , transforming it to feather or fur . They resumed their travel . But Fleta seemed increasingly uneasy . Something certainly was bothering her . In the hollow between the slope of the foothill and the slope of the mountain , she turned to him with a strange expression of hunger . Suddenly he remembered his fear of the unicorn , the first night , not knowing what it fed on . As it had turned out , unicorns were herbivores ; his concern had been groundless . But now " Are you all right , Fleta ? " he asked nervously . " I think I must leave thee now , " she said tightly . " I had hoped to see thee safely o'er the mountain , but that must needs wait . " " Fleta , where do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To the herd I was destined for , before I met thee . " " Well , of course you can go there , if you wish ! But why right now ? " " Mayhap I can go , and return in a few days to see thee the rest of thy journey . Thou shouldst be safe here . " " Well , yes , if that 's the way you feel ! But ? "  | " It be fairest to thee . " She looked about . " There be fruit trees ahead , and so long as thou dost not go east to the river , and dost avoid being spotted from the air ? " " Fleta , please tell me why ! Have I given you some offense ? If I am too much of a burden  --  if I 'm not doing enough ? " " I see I must needs tell thee . I must go to the Stallion to be bred . " " Right now ? " She made a wan smile . " As soon 's I can reach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Another long run ? You 'll wear yourself out ! Ca n't it wait for a more convenient time ? " " Mach , must I speak more directly than I like . With thy kind , breeding be at convenience . Not so with my kind . When a mare dost come into heat , she must be bred ; she doth have no choice . Be she in the wrong herd , the local Stallion must do it ; no choice for him either . That be why I could not approach mine own Herd in this time . " Mach remembered what he had learned of horses and other animals . The females came into heat at intervals , and bred compulsively . They had no interest in such activity at any other time , but were desperate for it then . Fleta was an animal and so followed this pattern . She had seemed so much like a human being , especially because she had remained most of the time in her human form , that this aspect of her nature had not occurred to him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concern when we went naked , " he said . " When you  --  saw me aroused . You knew that  --  that breeding occurs only within a creature 's own species . So you had no interest in ? " He found himself beginning to flush , and did n't care to discuss it further . " That be but a half truth , Mach , " she said . " I would fain have played with thee as I did with Bane in years o ' yore . But it be not seemly , when the parties are of age to know better . " " Yes , of course . We are two different species . There can be no such thing between us . " He sighed . " Go and do what you must , Fleta ; I will wait for your return . " " Aye . " But she did not move , and he saw her lower lip trembling again .  | " What 's the problem , Fleta ? Do n't worry about me ; I 'll be fine , here . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " If the goblins spy thee ? " " I 'll take that chance ! Please , Fleta , do n't let me interfere with your life any further ! " " 0 , I wish there were the right plants in these mountains ! " she exclaimed . " Plants ? " " Herbs . We eat them at need , to suppress the cycle . " " Oh . " " 0 Mach , I love thee and would not leave thee vulnerable to the dangers of Phaze . I want to leave thee not ! " Mach took a step toward her , his arms outstretched , intending to comfort her , but she backed hastily away . " I dare not touch thee now ! " she whispered . " But I mean you no harm , Fleta ! " he protested . " Dost thou not see  --  it be thee I would be bred by , not some stupid stallion ! " Mach was stunned . " But  --  but I 'm not your species ! We agreed that it was not proper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said , biting her lip . " And no way it would take . I be a pighead even to say this , but ? " " Are you saying  --  you and I ? ? " " The body knoweth not ; it thinks one breeding be as good as another . I could stay with thee till the time pass ? " " Stay  --  and ? ? " " Dost despise me now ? " she asked , her face wet with tears . " Fain would I ne'er have had thee know , but methought I could get thee to safety before ? " Mach worked it out aloud , to be sure there was no misunderstanding . " If you and I tried to breed , nothing would come of it because of the difference in our species . But then you would not have to run off to the stallion . You could stay with me . " " That be my thought . I know I have no right  --  I know it he wrong " Fleta , I come from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  we do this sort of thing all the time , knowing none of it can take . I myself am the offspring of an impossible  | marriage between a man and a machine . I have not  --  not tried to engage in  --  not with you , because  --  I understood you did not want it ! " " Ne'er did I say I wanted it not , " she said . " I said it should not be . I spoke not for myself , but for my culture . " " Then we have no problem ! " he exclaimed . " I have  --  have longed for  --  if I had realized ? " " Then  --  thou wouldst do it ? " " Just tell me when ! " Something gave way in her . " Now ? " she asked faintly . Mach stepped toward her again , and this time she did not retreat . " Now and forever ! " he cried . They came together , and he discovered in a moment that this was no ordinary tryst . He tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tear off his clothing and her own . All she wanted was one thing , and she wanted it instantly . They did that one thing , but such was the urgency and haste of it that it was not , for him , the fulfilling experience he had anticipated . He lay beside her on the leafy ground , his clothing half off , her cloak the same , and wondered whether that really could be all there was to it , in the living state . No preliminaries , no caressing , no speaking , not even kissing ; just the straight , raw thrust of it . Yet of course she was an animal , and this was the way her kind did it , regardless of the form assumed . He should have known . She turned to him , on the ground . There were twigs in her hair , and dirt was on her breasts . " Mach ? " " Yes ? " " Canst  --  again ? " " Again ? Now ? " As a robot , Mach could have done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficult . " Um , let 's work up to it a bit more slowly , this time , " he said . " But I need it now ! " she protested . To be in heat : to have a temporary but insatiable appetite for sex . He understood this intellectually , but his body could not keep the pace . " I 'll try , " he said . Fie tried , and to his surprise found he was able . The body was young and healthy , and the mind retained desire . This time the ulmination was slower , but she seemed satisfied .  | He relaxed , glad he had gotten through . She would not have to charge off to the herd . But in a few minutes she stirred again . " Canst ? ? " " Fleta , there is only so much flesh can do ! " he cried . " But an it not do more , must needs l : seek the stallion  --  and this I want not ! " Because her body governed this need , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had he not had his own experience with involuntary arousal . So Mach tried again . This time he made a production of it , deliberately kissing her and playing with her breasts and stroking her body . She tolerated this , but it was not her interest ; she craved the breeding , nothing else . Finally he was able to do it a third time , and then she relaxed . But too soon she stirred again . " Canst ? ? " Mach lurched to his feet . " Must  --  urinate , " he said , and headed for the bushes . In the bushes he did what he said he would do , but his mind was elsewhere . He had thought that one or two acts would satisfy the need ; now he knew that the need was as far beyond his means as the galloping travel across the plain had been . Yet Fleta was under the control of her cycle ; she had to be bred , as she put it , and if he could not serve in lieu of the stallion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had to find a way to accommodate her , at least until her cycle moved on . He gazed at his limp anatomy . This was hopeless ! Then he had a notion . He worked it out in his head , and then hummed to summon his magic . " Grant me the skill to perform at will , " he sang , thinking of sex . The fog formed and dissipated  --  and abruptly his potency was restored . For once his magic had worked the way he wanted ! He strode back to Fleta . Without a word he took her in his arms and did what she wished . There was no special joy in it ; the spell merely made him potent , not satisfied . Perhaps that was why it worked , he realized : he now had no more satisfaction in the act than she did , therefore was never satiated . Then , before she could stir again , he did it again . And again . He was magically competent . Finally , after half a dozen repetitions , she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relaxed , but his anatomy did not . Sure enough , in half an hour she woke , wanting more . So it was for the afternoon , and the night , and the following morning . Finally , in the afternoon , her cycle moved on , and she needed no more from him . It was Mach 's turn to sleep the sleep of exhaustion , as the energy drained from his body by the potency spell had to be restored . If Fleta had run hundreds of kilometers in an afternoon , he had performed a similar feat . They resumed their journey , climbing the great purple mountain . But now some of the urgency was gone . Why was he going to see the Brown Adept ? Mach asked himself . To find out how to return to Proton ? What , then , would become of Fleta ? To escape the pursuit by the various monsters ? They seemed to be free of it here . Yet if he did not go  --  if he just stayed here ? what of Bane , whose body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to think only of himself . Fleta paused , looking at him . " Thou'rt all right ? " " Just wishing I could stay here forever , with you . But that would be at Bane 's expense . " " Aye . And he be an apprentice Adept . Our love be not for eternity . " She looked so forlorn as she said it , that he had to take her in his arms and kiss her . This time she responded warmly . " Funny thing , " he said . " Yesterday , when  --  you would n't kiss me . " " This be love , " she said . " That be breeding . " " But ca n't the two be joined ? " Her brow furrowed . " They be two different things ! " " Not in my frame . " " What a funny frame ! " " I suppose so . " What point to debate it with her ? Her nature did not equip her to understand . They found a niche to spend the night , well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the darkness closed in , Mach brought up the question of the afternoon again . " When you 're out of heat , you do n't seek sex , " he said . " Aye . It he pointless , then . " " But can you do it ? " " Can , aye . Did , as game with Bane . But why ? " 154 Piers Anthony " Because I prefer to combine love and sex . That 's the way it is , with human beings . " " But when it be impossible to breed ? " " When we did it , it was impossible to breed . But we did it anyway , for another reason . " " To prevent me from running away , " she agreed . " And glad I am that thou didst manage that , Mach ! But now there be no danger o ' that . " " So even your kind can do it for other reason than for breeding . " She considered . " Aye . " " I 'd like to do it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why of course , Mach , an it please thee ! It meaneth naught to me , other than as a game . " She hiked up her cloak and spread her legs . " But be not long about it , so I can sleep . " " My way , " he said . He kissed her , and kissed her again , and proceeded from there , and she cooperated warmly , though evidently confused about his progress , until at last they completed the act in the midst of another kiss . " Oh , Mach , " she whispered breathlessly . " I think I like it thy way better ! " " Aye , " he agreed , smiling . " Let 's do it again ! " " Tomorrow ! " he said . She sighed . But she rested her head against his shoulder and slept , instantly . Mach suspected she had been teasing him , but he was not about to inquire . They crossed the range at a high , chill pass , where the wind cut through bitingly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because this body was better for both the terrain and the cold , and Mach rode her , huddling as low as he could . But as they moved toward the shelter of the tree-line , a shape loomed in the sky . It was a harpy , and not Phoebe , for the hair was wrong . In a moment there were several harpies , closing in They had been spotted . Fleta raced for the trees . Then she stopped , and changed t. hummingbird form , and Mach climbed a twisted tree and hid as  | well as he could in the foliage . The harpies flapped close and peered about , calling out curses , but could not locate the fugitives . Frustrated , they departed , for they too were getting chilled . Mach descended , and Fleta joined him in human form . " But they will alert the goblins , " she said . " And from the goblins we can not hide thus . " " We 'll just have to move as far as we can , so they do n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a direction they do n't expect . " They moved southwest . Fleta showed the way in bird form , and Mach charged along as rapidly as he could . When they came to a clifflike formation that would have taken time to skirt , Mach managed to conjure some rope , and used it to swing himself down , drawing on a skill developed for the Game . In this manner they made good progress , hoping to get beyond the range the goblins would search . They succeeded . By nightfall they were painfully tired , but there was no evidence of pursuit . They snatched fruits to eat and found some soft ferns to sleep on . " And now it be tomorrow , " Fleta murmured , snuggling in close . " What ? " " When I did say Let 's do it again , ' thou didst reply ' Tomorrow , ' " she reminded him . " Oh . " Mach was so tired that this had entirely slipped his mind . Then she laughed , and slept . She had indeed been teasing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But if you try that tease tomorrow . . . " he muttered as he faded out . But in the morning the goblins were casting closer , knowing that the prey was somewhere in the vicinity . Mach and Fleta hardly got moving before they were spied . Fleta changed to unicorn form and Mach jumped on her back . She galloped past the goblins and on down and out of the mountains at a rate the goblins could not match . But as they emerged on the southern plain beyond the mountains , the goblins were not far behind . A broad wave of them advanced , preventing any possible cutback to cover . Then ahead a new shape appeared . " Oh , no ! " Mach breathed . " A dragon ! " lie remembered that in Proton the dome-city of  | Dradom was in this region . That meant this would be the Dragon Demesnes in Phaze . If there was one thing worse than goblins Fleta slowed , wary of the dragon . It was a huge fire-breather ; they could tell by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was winged , so it would be able to go after them in the air ; they could not avoid it or outrun it . The only escape would be straight back the way they came  --  and there the goblins waited , in a giant cup-shaped formation . The goblins obviously believed that the quarry would choose to turn back and be captured , rather than proceed forward and be toasted and eaten . But Mach knew that though he might be spared , the goblins had no such intent for Fleta . She would be raped and/or eaten by the army of little monsters . He could n't allow that . " Let me try magic , " he said to her furry ear as she slowed her running . She twitched the ear , acknowledging . Mach concentrated , humming a tune to build up his magic . He was gradually getting the hang of it . Music , concentration , and a firm notion of exactly what he wanted  --  these were the important elements . That firm notion was perhaps the most vital part of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as consciously . Thus his effort to conjure a comb for the harpy misfired , because it was a minor matter to him , while his spell to generate his own potency had worked , because he had really known he needed it . The sung rhyme mostly triggered the magic , somewhat the way one told a computer to " execute . " He had to be sure everything was right before he sang the rhyme ; any sloppiness ruined the result . The dragon was getting close . It was licking its giant chops . Fleta fluted nervously  --  and that gave him another idea . " Play a tune ! " he cried to her . " I 'll sing to it , when I cast the spell ! " She played . She was worried , but her music , as always , was lovely . He listened for a moment , enjoying it , getting the feel of it , trying to attune himself to it to the maximum . Then he sang : " Make our flight be out of sight ! " Fleta @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She was still there , but she was entirely invisible . He glanced at himself , and found nothing . He was invisible too . This time the spell had really worked !  | " We 're completely invisible , " he told her . " I suppose we can be heard and smelled , so we 'd better shy away from the dragon , but no one can track us by sight . I think . " She swerved , and the dragon did not . The dragon seemed confused , its head swinging this way and that as it peered about , trying to spot the prey it had seen a moment before . The wind was from the west , carrying their scent east , so Fleta swerved to run east . But her hooves kicked up sand , so she slowed to a walk . Now they were truly invisible . They walked sedately away from both dragon and goblins . They circled back to the mountains , recovering the protection of the trees at the base . Mach did not dare dismount lest he lose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he continued to ride . But at this pace it was no strain on her . In the afternoon they came to the river that emerged from the range . " This must be the one the dragon is in , upstream , " Mach said . " Maybe we can spend the night here , since no one can see us . " Fleta fluted agreement . " If we get separated , make some music and I 'll come to you , " he said , walking to a tree for some fruit . But there was no danger of her getting lost . In a moment he felt her hand in his . She had changed back to girl form , invisibly , and rejoined him . As they settled down for the night , she whispered , " Is tomorrow here yet ? " " I thought you 'd never ask ! " he said , and grabbed her . It was a strange and wonderful thing , doing it invisibly . The first time he kissed her , he got a mouthful of hair ; then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , giggling . It occurred to Mach that he should neutralize the spell , which he presumed he could do merely by making up a rhyme to that effect , but the invisibility was so convenient for foiling the pursuit that he decided to leave it in place . And so it was that they made their way east to the large river that cut through the mountains from the north , and along its shore until they reached the wooden towers of the Brown Demesnes.  | Bane found himself in the apartment , with Agape back to her jelly state . He must have been unconscious , and she still was . Obviously the technicians of Proton had the means to knock a robot out and to knock out an entity of Moeba , and when the charade had been exposed , these means had been used . He discovered that his chewed finger had been restored ; someone had done some work on him , perhaps replacing that unit . He decided to wake Agape , if he could . He did n't like the present situation , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attempt without her . He reached for her , but hesitated to touch that semiliquid form . It was not that it repulsed him , but that he was afraid he might do her some damage . " Agape , " he said . " Can you hear me ? Wake ! " She did not stir . Perhaps she could not hear , with no ears at present . Surely she could not see , with no eyes . He extended one finger and touched the protoplasm . It was not actually liquid ; it had a translucent skin . His touch depressed a spot , that returned when he withdrew . It was like poking a water bag . Still she did not stir .  | He tried again , this time pushing her surface with his whole hand . The substance proved to be infinitely malleable , giving way wherever he applied pressure , resettling in whatever new configuration was convenient , and slowly returning to its original state when allowed to . But it did not animate itself . Finally he took hold with both hands and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the form elongated . He continued to haul , and the end of it came over the edge of the bed . Finally the rest of the mass slid down , and the substance resumed a more globular form . Bane let go , and the mass sank down on the floor at the foot of the bed , the portion that remained on the bed sliding along to merge with the main mass . Now the body of it was on the floor . Bane did n't like the notion of her getting dirty , so he tried to put the mass back on the bed . He put his arms around it and lifted , but only portions came up ; most of it simply slid through his grasp and resettled below . He tried again , sliding his arms more carefully underneath ; then the center came up and the protoplasm to either side flowed down , leaving him with a thinning strand that would not stay on the bed . He pondered , then fetched a sheet from the bed , put it on the floor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sheet . Then he caught up the corners of the sheet , making a bundle . He lifted this up to the bed and set it down . But as he swung the mass over , his feet could not follow ; he lost his balance and fell facefirst onto the jelly . Now it stirred . Bane tried to lift himself free , but the protoplasm spread out beyond the range of his hands , squeezed flat by his weight , and wherever he tried to set his palm , he was squishing more of the stuff . Meanwhile it was animating more actively , trying to form into the human shape but prevented by his presence on it . Bane rolled , squashing one side of the mass but freeing the other side . He made it to the surface of the bed , but some of the protoplasm was carried along with him , half covering him . I le waited , and the arms , legs , torso and head of Agape formed , beside him and over him .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
