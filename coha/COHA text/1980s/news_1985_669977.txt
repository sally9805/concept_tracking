NEW YORK  --  E.F. Hutton &; Co. disclosed that it failed to provide 18 internal documents demanded by federal prosecutors who investigated massive overdrafting by the securities firm . Hutton also acknowledged for the first time that some senior executives may have been involved in the illegal activities . Hutton said that none of the recently discovered documents " necessarily indicate knowledge of improper banking practices on the part of any particular individual . " But in an interview chairman Robert Fomon said it " seems incredible to me " to argue that only a few mid-level managers were aware of and condoned the illegal overdrafting scheme to which Hutton pleaded guilty in May . " I ' m confident there are going to be some disciplinary actions taken and some terminations , " Mr. Fomon said , suggesting that some steps are likely to involve more-senior company officials . Some of the documents indicate that George L. Ball , the company ' s former president , knew in detail of at least one instance of Hutton ' s aggressive check-overdrafting practices . Mr. Fomon said the documents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Ball ) knew these were illegal practices . " But Mr. Fomon acknowledged that the number of documents and Mr. Ball ' s handwritten comments on many of them raise new questions about the knowledge senior executives , including Mr. Ball , had about overdrafting . Mr. Fomon also said that " it is possible more documents " sought under Justice Department subpoenas " could be discovered . " He didn ' t elaborate . Mr. Ball said in prepared statements that " a careful reading " of the documents " clearly demonstrates that he had no knowledge " of any illegal practices . " Mr. Ball has believed and continues to believe that no senior Hutton official was aware of the abusive , excessive overdraft practices , " the spokesman said . Hutton said that it has given copies of the 18 recently discovered documents to the Justice Department , the Securities and Exchange Commission , the House subcommittee on crime , and Griffin Bell , whom Hutton retained to head an internal investigation of the overdrafting practices . The documents include a memo dated May 12 , 1981 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $30 , 000 a month " just from overdrafting of the bank account . " That amount dropped to $10 , 000 after the branch changed cashiers . On June 3 , 1981 , Mr. Ball wrote in a covering memo to the May 12 document that the value of effective branch cashiers is " a point well worth remembering , and acting on . " Copies of this document were among those circulating in Washington in recent days . Mr. Ball left Hutton in July 1982 , and is currently president and chief executive officer of Prudential-Bache Securities Inc . He has said that he wasn ' t aware of any illegal check overdrafting practices at Hutton . In May , Hutton pleaded guilty to 2 , 000 counts of mail and wire fraud relating to its check overdrafting practices . At that time , the Justice Department said that it decided against prosecuting individual Hutton employees because it concluded that only a few mid-level managers were involved in the scheme . The Justice Department also said that it would be difficult to prove a case against any individual Hutton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chairman , Mr. Fomon , asserted " the Justice Department ' s description seems incredible to me . . . I can not believe the whole thing was orchestrated " by a few mid-level managers without the support of more senior executives . However , Mr. Fomon said he wouldn ' t speculate about how high such involvement may have been before Mr. Bell completes his independent inquiry . During a press conference in Washington yesterday before Hutton ' s surprise announcement , Attorney General Edwin Meese said the Justice Department is " looking at new developments " concerning Hutton ' s failure to provide some documents sought by the government . " Our attention to the case continues , " Mr. Meese said , adding that " we are keeping our eyes open to any new information . " Mr. Fomon said that when Mr. Ball left the company in the summer of 1982 , he left behind  --  without telling top management  --  a " jumble of two full file drawers " in his office filled with documents , some of them relating to check overdrafts . When the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " it never occurred " to the company ' s attorneys or other employees that such files existed , so they weren ' t searched for relevant documents . Mr. Fomon said other documents that the company failed to provide to the Justice Department were uncovered recently in branch or regional offices , included in files bearing Mr. Ball ' s name . " The explanations seem quite logical to me , " Mr. Fomon said , maintaining " there was no intent to withhold anything . " One of the memos to Mr. Ball , dated March 11 , 1982 , described a meeting of Midwest branch managers at which each manager was given a " hermetically sealed envelope containing play money equalling the dollars they could earn if they attained the firm average in each of the three major components of interest . " The play money was handed out to " dramatize the impact of interest income on the managers compensation , " the memo said . Beside the comments on play money Mr. Ball wrote , " neat idea . " Also , Mr. Fomon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " to cover why these documents are appearing at this late date . " And he confirmed that Hutton executives and attorneys for the company have balked at turning over certain sensitive internal documents requested by Mr. Bell . " I knew there was a problem in the past " in providing Mr. Bell speedy access to such material , Hutton ' s chairman said . " But I cured it this afternoon . Bell gets whatever he wants . " In response to a Wall Street Journal article regarding his investigation , Mr. Bell said his inquiry " hasn ' t been impeded " by delays in obtaining certain documents . Mr. Fomon ' s comments also shed new light on discussions he had in November 1984 with then-Attorney General William French Smith concerning the status of the government ' s criminal investigation . The Hutton chairman said " it seemed the most natural thing in the world to me " to bring up the matter during a private lunch with Mr. Smith and his wife at the exclusive Jockey Club Restaurant in New York . But a few days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head of the Justice Department ' s criminal division , called and warned him that such private contacts with the attorney general were improper . Mr. Fomon said he made the mistake because " I don ' t know the protocol of being indicted . " Credit : Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal
