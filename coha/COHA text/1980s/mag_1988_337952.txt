Call it the Good Friday rampage . At twilight on April 1 , a brown Cadillac sedan glided up to the corner of Vernon and Raymond avenues in South Central Los Angeles . Words were exchanged between the young men in the car , members of a Crips street gang , and a 16-year-old who was hanging out on the sidewalk . Suddenly , the mobile " gangbangers " blasted the youth . A moment later , they turned their guns on a pedestrian across the street . <P> The Caddy then cruised two blocks down Raymond , where a small group of youngsters had gathered . Two gunmen stepped out of the car and opened fire into the shrieking crowd . Witnesses later told of a " river of blood " in the street . Deshawn Holly , 5 , was hit with four bullets but miraculously survived . Stacey Childress , 19 , was less lucky . Of the eleven people shot in the five- minute spree , Childress was the sole fatality . The presumed motive for the bloodbath : a drug deal gone bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than two decades , but the burgeoning crack trade has lately made such groups as the Crips even more willing to kill for the sake of greater profits . Children of the underclass , weaned on violence and despair , have become bloodthirsty entrepreneurs . Some have made small fortunes marketing the cheap , explosive cocaine derivative  --  known as " rock " in L.A.  --  while settling business differences with state-of-the-art firearms . Many more have wound up in prison or the graveyard . <P> " There are a million kids out there who have no skills other than fighting , " says James Galipeau , a veteran officer in the probation department . " They are not afraid of the police or jail or of dying . " As demonstrated by the Good Friday attack , the gang members also show a grotesque disregard for the safety of innocent people . Of the 387 gang-related homicides in Los Angeles County last year , approximately half were innocent bystanders caught in the cross fire of shootouts . <P> Since February , Los Angeles Police Chief Daryl Gates has waged an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force of 100 has been busting 20 gang members a day and has raided 43 rock houses . But Good Friday made those efforts seem futile . While the carnage on Raymond Avenue took place , 180 police officers stood for roll call at a command center less than a mile away . <P> Gates launched his biggest offensive yet last week : 1,000-man sweeps of gangland territories . At four command posts around the city , including the parking lot of the Los Angeles Coliseum , jail buses with barred windows and portable booking stations awaited fresh business . Gates had announced the drive with such fanfare that many dealers in South Central L.A. had gone to ground , but on Friday the police still managed to bust 334 gang members citywide on charges ranging from driving without a license to narcotics and weapons possession .
