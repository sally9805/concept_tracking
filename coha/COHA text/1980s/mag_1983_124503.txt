Mariner owner George Argyros created a storm of controversy last week when he replaced the popular Rene Lachemann with Del Crandall , who managed Milwaukee from 1972 to ' 75 and most recently has directed the Dodgers ' successful AAA team in Albuquerque . " I do n't have to ask the fans , " said Argyros . " Nobody said if you 're going to lead something you have to be a populist . " He did n't ask the players , either . In the clubhouse , Outfielder Richie Zisk said , " It 's the first time that I 've had tears in my eyes while in a baseball uniform since I dropped a fly ball that cost us the state championship in Little League . " // Lachemann was acclaimed last season for guiding the Mariners to a 76-86 record , the best in their six-year history .

This year he 'd batted .190 with seven homers . Perry , who has a 310-261 career record , and Cruz could be picked up by other clubs or sent to the minors . // Pittsburgh used its lumber to end its slumber last week . The Pirates , who had been 23-36 , went on a .321 hitting tear as they ran off eight straight wins , their longest streak since 1980 . During that spurt they had 93 hits  --  at least 10 in all but one game  --  and 12 of their 29 extra-base hits were homers . Catcher Tony Pena led the way by batting .478 . And fleet Marvell Wynne , acquired two weeks ago in a trade that brought him up from the Mets ' AAA Tidewater club , established himself in centerfield by going 10 for 32 and keeping his average at .313. // Dodger Second Baseman Steve Sax , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week to run his total to 21 for this season . This projects to 48 errors for the year ; the modern National League record for a second baseman of 55 was set by George Grantham of Chicago in 1923. // When Sax missed two games last week because of food poisoning , it was suggested that he got it from eating his glove . Actually , his glove has not been at fault ; it has been his arm . Almost all of Sax 's errors have come on throws , the majority on routine plays when he has had ample time . " It 's just a mental thing , " says Sax . " Sometimes I pick up the ball and think too much instead of throwing it . " // Correcting the deficiency , Los Angeles Shortstop Bill Russell says , " is n't going to come that easy for Steve . He got into the habit of lobbing the ball . " // Rookie Outfielder Mel Hall of the Cubs is such a loud and relentless talker that his teammates have put up a clubhouse picture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " My ears got this way from listening to Mel Hall for just three innings . " ... The 10 homers hit by Gary Redus , who was batting .244 at week 's end , are the most by a Cincinnati rookie since Bernie Carbo had 21 in 1970 .... Kansas City second baseman Frank White set a club record by getting one or more RBIs in 11 straight games . // " His fastball is working , and he should use it more , " said Detroit Catcher Lance Parrish recently of Pitcher Jack Morris with whom he 'd been at odds about pitch selection . Last week , according to Morris , the two " had a little talk before the game . The main thing is we 've got to believe in each other . If I shake him off , he should n't get upset . And if he feels strongly enough about something , he has the right to come to the mound to talk about it . I benefited from our talk , and he benefited from it . " They must have : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I threw my fastball more because I had a good , live one , " Morris said . " Some days I do n't , and that 's why I use other pitches to set it up . " // During their last 37 games through Sunday , Padre relievers had pitched 89 ? innings and had a 7-3 record , 11 saves and a 2.01 ERA .... Rick Honeycutt of Texas , who was 10-3 with a major league-leading 1.45 ERA at week 's end , had given up one run or less in 11 of his 15 starts .... Boston 's John Henry Johnson has become the consummate mop-up man : He 's been in 12 games , all losses , during which the Sox have been out-scored 98-39 ....

With three veterans on the disabled list , the A 's are carrying five rookies on their pitching staff . // Two of the National League 's finest pitchers  --  Joaquin Andujar of the Cardinals and Steve Carlton of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recent 15 starts through Sunday , Andujar had a 4.50 ERA and had lost 10 of 11 decisions . Following a 2-1 loss last week to the Mets , Andujar was a jumble of emotions . First , he emptied six or so cans of beer into a bucket and dumped the contents over his head . Next , he kicked over a trash can in the training room and threw a bottle , which shattered near the shower room . Then Andujar sat down and politely answered reporters ' questions . Later he said , " I be all right . Mentally , I all right now . I have a strong mind . I not keeping my head down . " And then he said , " I ca n't believe it . I going to go crazy . " One thing that has hurt Andujar is that in his 10 defeats St. Louis scored only eight runs while he was still in the game . Cardinal Catcher Darrell Porter pointed out two other problems : " His control 's been off . And he has n't had the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shelled by Montreal on June 20 , Carlton had given up 16 runs in 20 ? innings during his last three starts and was 1-6 in his last seven starts . " He did n't throw one Lefty-type fastball all night , " said Philadelphia Pitching Coach Claude Osteen after the Montreal bombing . " He tried to finesse his way through . " Four days later Carlton evened his record at 8-8 by beating New York 6-3 . Carlton did n't have his best stuff in that game , either , but he did regain the alltime strikeout lead from Houston 's Nolan Ryan ( 3,551 to 3,548 ) by fanning six Mets. // Last season Kansas City Pitcher Bud Black was 4-6 and had a 4.58 ERA because he was " too fine all the time , going for the black . " Now in his mind 's eye he has divided the plate into thirds , giving him more room to hit on each side . And even if he pitches down the middle third , Black feels he does n't have to worry . " It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I sure was n't giving myself enough , " says Black , 25 , who at week 's end was 3-1 , with a 2.82 ERA . " Even the very good hitters make an out two out of every three times . I 'm not afraid of making mistakes now , which is the biggest problem for most young pitchers. " // With his second five-year term as president of the American League ending later this year , Lee MacPhail , 65 , had planned to retire . Thus , it was surprising that MacPhail recently added the role of president of the Player Relations Committee to his league duties . That position had been vacant since the April 7 resignation of Ray Grebey. // " I really did n't want the job , " MacPhail says . " I told Dan Galbreath chairman of the PRC and president of the Pirates the only way I 'd take it would be if all 26 teams wanted me . To my amazement , they all voted for me.
