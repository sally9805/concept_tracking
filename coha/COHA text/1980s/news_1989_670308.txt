What do winning stocks have in common ? Investment specialists have come up with a wealth of divergent , sometimes contradictory answers over the decades . Now , new academic research raises questions about some widely held beliefs , and gives additional perspective on others . Among other things , it suggests that two of the most popular strategies with individual investors may not be the best way to select winning stocks . Many investors credit their success to picking small-cap issues ( the shares of companies with low total stock-market value ) and those with low price-earnings ratios ( the price of a company ' s stock divided by its per-share earnings ) . But neither criterion would have pointed investors to the winning stocks featured in a recent study by Marc Reinganum , a finance professor at the University of Iowa . In fact , the new research seems to raise questions about Mr. Reinganum ' s earlier , ground-breaking studies on the so-called small-cap effect . That work supported the idea that small-cap stocks outperform the market over time . But Mr. Reinganum is quick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these popular strategies  --  only that they are not the be-all and end-all of investment success . " The fascinating thing is that there are strategies independent of these variables that earn very , very good performance , " he says . " In other words , there is more than one way to skin the investment cat . " Mr. Reinganum ' s latest studies sifted out the common characteristics of 222 stocks that tripled in price during a given calendar year in the 1970-1983 period , then tested them on a different universe of stocks over different time periods . Aside from the fact that small size and low price-earnings ratios weren ' t among the variables shared by winning stocks , Mr. Reinganum ' s highflying test group also defied conventional wisdom on other fronts . " Smart-money " variables , which measure increasing holdings among top executives and other corporate " insiders , " as well as such institutions as banks , mutual funds and investment advisers , were poor leading indicators for the price explosion of these stocks . There wasn ' t any flurry of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as soon as the pros jumped on a trend , it was usually too late for anyone else to take advantage of it , the research shows . On the other hand , Prof. Reinganum ' s findings provide scant comfort for contrarian investors who try to beat the market by picking stocks that are out-of-favor with the mainstream investment community . More than half of the winning stocks were selling at close to two-year highs before their prices took off . So what did work ? The winners ranked high on several factors that are part of some classic investment approaches . These included a number of fundamental measures : a per-share price that is less than the company ' s per-share book value ( its assets minus its liabilities , divided by the number of shares outstanding ) ; year-to-year increases in earnings over the past five years ; earnings that have been increasing at an accelerating pace ; and simply having pre-tax profits . They also included some technical indicators , which attempt to predict future stock-price movements from historical price changes . Taken together , these fundamental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from pools that excluded the original 222 winners in Prof. Reinganum ' s study , that substantially outperformed the market . For instance , this combined strategy beat the Standard &; Poor ' s 500 index by an average 36. 7% over the two years ended in 1986 . Prof. Reinganum also tested a simplified strategy combining only three variables : a per-share price less than per-share book value , accelerating earnings , and strong price " momentum " ( a technical indicator that measures the rate of change in a stock ' s price over some period of time ) . The stocks picked using this three-pronged approach also beat the market in the 1984-86 period  --  this time by a smaller but still very respectable margin of more than 16 percentage points . An independent test of Prof. Reinganum ' s three-pronged approach shows that , at least over the past year , it would have been better to have dropped price momentum as a leg of his strategy  --  or to have flipped it , concentrating on stocks that had gone down , rather than up . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. , shows that price-to-book and earnings-acceleration measures alone produced a list of 45 stocks that was up about 38% through November  --  some 30 percentage points ahead of the S &; index . Taking stocks that also ranked well on price momentum would have gleaned only four issues , which together underperformed the S &; 500 by two percentage points . By contrast , choosing stocks on the list that had poor momentum ( that is , those whose prices were weakest in 1987 ) would have turned up four stocks that bounced back to beat the index by more than 47 percentage points through last November . This jibes with research by Robert Jones , a quantitative analyst at Goldman , Sachs &; Co. , showing that strong earnings acceleration combined with poor price momentum can sometimes signal overlooked values . Nevertheless , Prof. Reinganum defends his three-pronged approach . When the pickings of stocks that meet all three criteria are very slim , he argues , it ' s a sign to stay out of stocks entirely .
