An angry Carter struggles to put new pressure on the Kremlin <P> Crossroads . Watershed . Turning point . <P> These are all terms being used by U.S. experts as they grope for some way to define and explain the momentous events that have suddenly engulfed the international arena . What is clear is that the Soviet Union 's invasion of Afghanistan has heightened world tensions to their most serious level since the Viet Nam War , and perhaps even before <P> Soviet forces continued to subjugate Afghanistan last week , and some crack units took up stations perilously close to the Iran and Pakistan borders . At the same time , a flotilla of five Soviet warships was spotted steaming through the Sea of Japan , apparently on its way to reinforce the Soviet fleet contingent in the Indian Ocean . No less worrisome were the medical bulletins from Belgrade , reporting on the rapidly deteriorating health of Yugoslav President Josip Broz Tito , 87 . Without Tito , who broke with the Kremlin in 1948 , Yugoslavia might fall prey to internal conflicts that could inspire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last week with reports of troop movements inside the U.S.S.R. and Eastern Europe . <P> But another possibility was also rising : that the aggression by the men of the Kremlin is causing a global reaction of such force that it may halt or at least squeeze the voracious Soviet bear . Outrage mounted in the U.S. , while at the United Nations the U.S.S.R. suffered a humiliating defeat in which it was abandoned by dozens of its Third World friends .

Instead of stumping through Iowa in a last-minute effort to woo supporters for this week 's important Democratic Party caucuses , the President barely got out of the White House last week ( 34 members of his staff and family , however , campaigned extensively for him in Iowa ) . Believing that the world may be at a juncture from which a new global balance of power could emerge , Carter is determined that America must take the lead and chart a course into the suddenly uncertain and perilous future . <P> Throughout the week , he telephoned foreign leaders , conferred with his top advisers and with some of the nation 's most experienced experts on international relations . Drawing on this counsel , the President drafted a major foreign policy speech that will , according to White House Press Secretary Jody Powell , examine " the implication of these crises for American policy at home and abroad . " It will call for a sustained , long-term response to what the White House has increasingly come to regard as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
