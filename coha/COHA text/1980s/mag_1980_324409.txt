Roger Tory Peterson completes a sparkling new bird guide <P> When his first Field Guide to the Birds of Eastern North America appeared in 1934 , Roger Tory Peterson , then 25 , had no inkling of what he was on the verge of creating . The guide and two subsequent revisions sold an extraordinary 3 million copies . Its clear drawings , with black lines pointing out distinctive features , and simple explanatory text helped expand bird watching from the pastime of a select few to a hobby that now engages more than 20 million Americans . <P> Peterson 's guide also played a role in creating today 's environmental awareness ; as he explains , birds act as a kind of " ecological litmus paper , " reacting to changes in their surroundings long before man does . Even Rachel Carson , author of Silent Spring , learned " birding " from the guide . Finally , Peterson may have wrought some environmental changes himself ; his followers have been so lavish in putting food out for birds that many cardinals , mourning doves and white-throated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Now 72 , a recipient of numerous honorary degrees ( he had only a high school diploma and some art training ) , plus the Medal of Freedom , Peterson has been under pressure for years from both his public and publisher to update his celebrated guide . Next month they will get their wish with the appearance of the latest and most eagerly awaited Peterson guide ( Houghton Mifflin ; $15 in hardcover , $9.95 paperback ) . <P> The new edition of the bible of Eastern birding is the first revamping since 1947 and the fourth since the initial work appeared 46 years ago . It contains nearly 1,700 Peterson drawings and paintings of 575 species of birds-all native to the Eastern U.S. and Canada - on 136 color plates . Unlike the first guide , which Peterson now dismisses as " simple-minded and crude , " descriptions run next to each bird rather than pages away . Another innovation : hundreds of range maps , drawn by Peterson 's third wife , Virginia , 54 , that show breeding grounds and winter and summer domiciles . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of which should disappoint baseball fans : the Baltimore oriole , now interbred with the Western Bullock 's oriole , is renamed the Northern oriole . <P> A sublime craftsman , Peterson paints in laborious detail , often from photographs he has taken with his own Nikons ; he is an expert birder who has counted more than 3,000 species and , say friends , can identify a rare bird from a speeding car . Still , the work for the new book was , in his words , " slavery of a sort , " involving countless 15-hour days in his studio in Old Lyme , Conn . Guarding his nearby home is a 2-ft. - high statue of Antarctica 's emperor penguin , Peterson 's favorite bird-some birders call him " King Penguin . " Says Peterson : " I like its manner and its elegance . They are survivors in one of the harshest climates in the world . "
