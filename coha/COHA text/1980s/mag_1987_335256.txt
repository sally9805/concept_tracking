At first it sounded like Pollyanna Day at the United Nations . An international parade of prizewinners gathered on the Grand Palais stage at the 40th Cannes Film Festival to pick up their scrolls and mouth the loftiest banalities . One young filmmaker from Soviet Georgia thanked " all the inhabitants of that big wonderful country called Cinema . " A Japanese director announced , " I would like to work for peace . " Wim Wenders , who picked up the director 's prize for his daunting , sentimental fantasy The Wings of Desire , ) said , " If we can improve the images of the world , perhaps we can improve the world . " Everyone was on his best behavior at this birthday party for the world 's most prestigious movie do . <P> Then , as if cued by Stephen King , the wicked witch showed up in this fairy- tale resort on the Cote d'Azur . The creature arrived in the ursine form of Maurice Pialat , critically the most revered , personally the most reviled , of France 's movie auteurs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new movie , Under the Sun of Satan , a stately adaptation of the Georges Bernanos novel about a self-torturing priest ( Gerard Depardieu ) ; its directorial style fell somewhere between rigor and rigor mortis . And now Yves Montand , president of this year 's festival jury , was announcing the award of the Palme d'Or to Pialat 's dour drama  --  the first local product to grab the top prize since A Man and a Woman at the 20th fest , in 1966 . <P> Montand might as well have said that Ripple had been designated the official French wine , for the Palais audience immediately erupted in derisive whistles and howls . Catherine Deneuve , who presented the award , pleaded futilely for the mob to give the director a chance to defend his honor . But the catcalls delighted Pialat . " If you do n't like me , " he proclaimed , " I can tell you , I do n't like you either . " He smiled and raised a defiant fist . More boos , more hoots . Somebody spat at him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's papers . <P> Thank you , members of the jury . Merci , M. Pialat and all your enemies in the Grand Palais . You brought the last-minute thrill of spontaneous animosity to a festival that had nearly suffocated in gentility . Until then , this assembly of 30,000 producers , directors , stars , distributors , critics and other swains of the celluloid muse could find little to cheer and even less to condemn . Oh , sure , you could watch Michael Sarrazin strangle a nude hermaphrodite in the Belgian thriller Mascara . You could cruise the low-rent Film Market and see ads for such films as Assault of the Killer Bimbos , Space Sluts in the Slammer and Surf Nazis Must Die . You could catch Jean-Luc Godard in a typically impish auto-da-fe . This year the Peter Pan of enfants terribles presented a captious , grating version of King Lear , starring both Norman Mailer and Burgess Meredith as Lear and Molly Ringwald as Cordelia . Godard , who later boasted that he had never read the play , seemed determined to accomplish what the banks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : to bankrupt the Cannon Group , his sponsoring studio .
