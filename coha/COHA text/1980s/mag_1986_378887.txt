France was in torment . Youths marched through the streets of Nantes shouting lethal threats at their neighbors . The Jewish-owned shops of Nancy were invaded and the synagogue besieged . In Paris , anti-Semitic troops marched in the Latin Quarter , on the boulevards and around the Palais de Justice : familiar sights to students of World War II  --  but this was two generations before , in 1897 . <P> The violence was triggered by the case of Captain Alfred Dreyfus , accused of treason against the state . His trial , exile to Devil 's Island and exoneration have been retailed in countless volumes and films ; the most celebrated , The Life of Emile Zola , won an Academy Award for best picture in 1937 . But The Affair manages to invest the drama with renewed pity and urgency . French Professor Jean-Denis Bredin is not content with a toneless recapitulation ; the dark background is carefully illuminated , and the major characters and walk-ons are given full dimension , including , at times , the homosexual flirtations of spies and Dreyfus ' adventures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the large cast , Captain Dreyfus is the least compelling . Framed by traitorous colleagues , he was at first incredulous , then hysterical and finally benumbed . His family and friends tirelessly protested his innocence , joined after two years by Emile Zola , the most famous and reviled writer of his time . The analyst of motives thundered what others had only whispered : the dominant powers of France , threatened by Germany , narcotized by visions of a glorious and irretrievable past , regarded Jews as dual threats . In one view , they were radicals seeking to undo the state . When that label did not adhere , they were vicious usurers , arms of the Rothschild octopus . The climate of xenophobia was intensified behind barracks doors , where a rising Jewish officer was considered an insult to history and an affront to destiny . <P> On Jan.13 , 1898 , Zola published what Bredin calls " a great document , one which marks an essential date in the history of journalism . " J ' Accuse was " an indictment of the forces and virtues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and hierarchies . " Zola 's outrage proved contagious . Slowly the bodyguard of lies surrounding the actual villains began to defect . Major Ferdinand Esterhazy , a German agent , fled the country . Lieut . Colonel Hubert Henry , who had forged Dreyfus ' handwriting on incriminating documents , committed suicide . <P> After twelve years of suffering , the captain was finally pardoned and passed from sight . But as Bredin convincingly argues , the next century was to be dramatically altered by the verdict and its reversal . If the anti-Dreyfus agitators and clerics represented France at its worst , the Dreyfusards , most of them Christian , demonstrated the nation 's passion for justice and equality . Both sides continued to seethe until they collided once again in 1940 , when the Third Reich occupied the country . Events like the upcoming trial of Nazi Captain Klaus Barbie , now imprisoned in Lyon , continue to show how many of the old " forces and virtues " survive to this day .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
