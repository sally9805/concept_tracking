He is also a member of the Metropolitan Council of the American Jewish Committee and of the board of the Stephen Wise Free Synagogue. // Aides to Mr. Dinkins confirmed the offer , the first one Mr. Dinkins has made for his prospective administration , and said they believe it will send a signal to voters , particularly Jews , that Mr. Dinkins is a mainstream Democrat. // // Competitive in Fund Raising // Mr. Kovner , who earlier this year headed a committee that advised Mr. Dinkins on whether to run for mayor , has told friends that he would be eager to join a Dinkins administration. // As Mr. Dinkins moved to broaden his appeal to the city ' s voters , the latest campaign finance reports showed that Rudolph W. Giuliani , the Republican-Liberal candidate for mayor , has become competitive with Mr. Dinkins in fund raising and appears assured of maintaining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change from the financial problems that have plagued him for months. // The Giuliani campaign treasurer , John H. Gross , credited the brighter financial picture to the candidate ' s jump in various polls and the fund-raising efforts of President Bush and members of his Administration. // In leaking the Kovner announcement , Mr. Dinkins ' s campaign aides acknowledged that they were risking accusations that they were being presumptive and even arrogant . Weighed against that was the need to assure voters that Mr. Dinkins will include a broad range of Democrats in his administration . <> <> Transition Committee // " We thought it important to drop some names , " said a Dinkins adviser . Earlier , Mr. Dinkins named as economic advisers Felix G. Rohatyn , the financier ; James Robinson of American Express , and Joseph Flom , the lawyer who was chairman of Mayor Edward I. Koch ' s campaign finance committee. // Mr. Dinkins has also designated Nathan Leventhal , president of Lincoln Center and a onetime Koch deputy mayor , and Gordon Davis , a lawyer , a former City Parks Commissioner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an unofficial transition committee .

They also said they would not be interested in returning to government. // Mr. Kovner was an associate in Mr. Koch ' s law firm in the mid-1960 ' s , but he and his wife , Sarah , have been identified in recent years with the liberal , anti-Koch wing of the Democratic Party. // Governmentally and politically , Mr. Kovner was recently appointed chairman of the State Commission on Judicial Conduct . <> <> ' One of the Biggest Law Firms ' // Peter L. Zimroth , the present Corporation Counsel , said he had spoken with Mr. Kovner and added that he would be " very pleased " if Mr. Kovner took the post , which Mr. Zimroth called " the best law job in America. " // He said " The variety of things we do is unparalleled . " He pointed out that the job includes supervision of a staff charged with a wide variety of legal matters . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country , " Mr. Zimroth said. // Time is also critical in the transition . Mr. Dinkins - or Mr. Giuliani - will have less than two months to set up a new administration presiding over a $27 billion budget and 224 , 682 workers under its direct control. // With only 10 days until the election , the latest campaign financial reports showed Mr. Dinkins still ahead of Mr. Giuliani in donations and spending , including a stunning $1 , 160 , 000 in used or reserved television air time , more than Mr. Dinkins spent for the whole primary campaign. // Mr. Giuliani spent about $781 , 000 on commercials during the same 20-day period ending last Monday , and Roger Ailes , his media adviser , said he was comfortable with the advertising spending available for the final days of the campaign. // Mr. Dinkins reported contributions for the period from Oct. 3 to Oct. 23 of $1 , 376 , 479 , while Mr. Giuliani reported contributions of $1 , 245 , 226 .

Mr. Dinkins claimed $257 , 143 in public matching funds and Mr. Giuliani , $205 , 826. // One measure of the frenetic fund-raising and spending was the estimate of Mr. Gross , the Giuliani campaign treasurer , that Mr. Giuliani had raised $450 , 000 in the last four days - after the latest reporting period ended. // Some of the money was raised yesterday at a breakfast at the Waldorf-Astoria featuring Jack F. Kemp , Secretary of Housing and Urban Development . Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Kemp then toured an apartment project on the Lower East Side that had been rehabilitated . <> <> ' Driving Around in the Car ' // Mr. Giuliani criticized his opponent as a politician who " hides from problems , from decisions . " He said Mr. Dinkins " wants moratoriums on decision-making so he can have fun being mayor. " // Later , asked to elaborate , he said : " What I meant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ David seems to enjoy driving around in the car , with the sirens on , and he seems to have enjoyed , until we stopped him , traveling on jet planes and that sort of thing . He was the candidate usually out of New York rather than in New York . He doesn ' t seem to be as willing to face up to the problems of New York City. " // Mr. Dinkins later responded , " That ' s rather sad . " He added , " We all ought to want to be mayor to provide the best life for the citizens of New York. " // Speaking at a news conference , Mr. Dinkins said he was " committed to exploring ways to restore free tuition to the City University. " // " Let ' s be clear , " he said from the steps of City Hall . " Free tuition is not going to come tomorrow . It ' s not going to come in the near future. " // Rita Rodin , director of public information for the City University of New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to restore free tuition. // The university , which now includes 21 institutions and has an enrollment of 194 , 000 students , had free tuition from its founding in 1847 until 1976 , when that practice was ended because of the city ' s fiscal crisis . Tuition is now $1 , 225 annually for students at community colleges and $1 , 250 for students at senior colleges. //
