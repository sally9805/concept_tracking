He would have had good reason . No pastel has ever sold for such a sum as $3. 74 million - or even come close to it . And it was one of his. // The fact that the sale was the highlight of an end-of-season series of major art auctions at Sotheby ' s ( one of the world ' s two great auction houses ) would have meant little to him - nor would the fact that the sale had attracted many of the world ' s major collectors , dealers , and museum curators. // What would , however , have stunned him , was the unbelievable price his pastel sold for . The $3. 74 million figure certainly surprised me . I had expected it to go for $2 million at most , and I wouldn ' t have been surprised if it had gone for several hundred thousand dollars less . It was , of course , a great picture , but it was a pastel , and as such , technically ' ' only ' ' a drawing. // But ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ballet dancer and an older woman seated on a bench , triumphed over the usual prejudice against works on paper , and scored entirely on merit . I was pleased , as I also was by the response to other works by Degas and his great Impressionist and Post-Impressionist colleagues . And by the interest shown in the other auctions at Sotheby ' s ( and at Christie ' s , the other major auction house ) devoted to 20th-century art. // I wasn ' t pleased , however , by the circus atmosphere that pervaded these sales , nor by the social and commercial attitudes that dominated them . The values of art were shoved aside by the concerns of wealth , power , and position to the point where the purchase and possession of art often became more a matter of prestige than of aesthetic pleasure. // All this shouldn ' t have bothered me , considering how long I ' ve been a part of the art world and the number of years I ' ve acted as an art appraiser . But it did , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over seeing art , the product of great passion , delight , love , and caring , treated as though it were nothing but a valuable piece of property , or something to hang on one ' s wall , at times just to impress the neighbors. // I realize there were genuine art lovers at these viewings , but I doubt they were among those individuals I overheard saying they needed a Klee to go with their tiny Dubuffet , or wanted a particular Picasso pencil portrait because it would look so impressive in their hallway . And I ' m positive two young men deep in discussion about the advisability of bidding for the Schnabel were thinking almost entirely of their margin of profit , should they sell it in two or three years . If they weren ' t , why were they so concerned about the stability of Schnabel ' s reputation ? // It ' s a pity art has become such a high-powered commercial enterprise . And yet there are compensations . These two series of auctions at Sotheby ' s and Christie ' s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the season . Anyone interested in art could have seen hundreds of outstanding paintings , sculptures , constructions , drawings , etc. , - as well as a handful of masterpieces - totally free of charge. // Of particular importance is the fact that such viewings are often the only time certain works will ever be seen by the public . Many of them come from private collections , and disappear into other private collections once the auctions are over . <> <> South America ' s Botero // Fernando Botero is that rare phenomenon in today ' s art world , an artist of international reputation who scaled the heights without affiliating himself with any of modernism ' s post-World War II movements . Even more unusual , he did it as a South American , an extraordinary feat in itself , since very few artists from there have yet achieved more than local or regional fame. // Botero was born in 1932 , high in the Colombian Andes . He started to draw seriously while still a child and by the time he was 16 had established something of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In 1952 , after two successful exhibitions in Bogota , he left for Europe. // While studying painting in Madrid and Florence , he fell in love with the works of Velazquez , Goya , and Giotto , an event which had a profound effect on the future course of his own art . By 1955 he was back in Bogota as a professor , and by the end of the decade he had evolved the basic elements of the style that would serve him well from then on. // This style was representational in approach , witty and ironic in attitude , and opulent in form . Everything he painted - but most especially children , vegetables , nudes , furniture , and cats - turned out plump and bigger than life . Fame came quickly - almost , it seemed , in direct ratio to the degree of rotundity his subjects reached. // An excellent miniretrospective of Botero ' s paintings is on view at Aberbach Fine Art here . Its nine very large canvases trace his career from 1962 to 1980 and include some of his better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at full strength - and without any of the superficially cute paintings that have overwhelmed so many recent shows of his current work . Those on view in this show are outstanding examples of each of his major periods , and they point up what a delightfully imaginative painter he really is . Of particular interest are two early single-figure canvases that would hold up beautifully in any exhibition of 20th-century art. // At Aberbach Fine Art , 988 Madison Avenue , through June 30. // Minimalism to Expressionism // Dramatic changes took place in American art between 1965 and 1980 . Some were so startling , in fact , that some art lovers still refuse to believe they actually happened . The shock was too great. // For years they had been told that art was a matter of formal purity , simplicity , and sensibility . Then , within a year or two , the exact opposite stormed center-stage . Art became loudly expressive , brash , exuberant , and often ' ' tasteless . ' ' It was like being told that the statue of the nude mermaid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held up as the ultimate in kitsch was now to be considered art. // ' ' Minimalism to Expressionism : Painting and Sculpture Since 1965 , ' ' at the Whitney Museum here surveys this significant shift in an exhibition of 57 works from the museum ' s permanent collection . Works by such artists as Andre , Stella , Judd , Hesse , Shapiro , Rothenberg , LeWitt , Salle , and Schnabel trace this period ' s shift from Minimalism to Post-Minimalism and then to today ' s Expressionism. // It ' s an excellent show . Patterson Sims , who organized it , is fast becoming one of our best and most influential curators . He has a good eye , boundless energy , and an enthusiasm for art that translates into some remarkable shows . Even when I disagree with him , I ' m glad he ' s around. // At the Whitney Museum through Sept. 18. // //
