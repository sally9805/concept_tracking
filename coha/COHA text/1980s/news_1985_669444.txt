' ' Through technology , this is how we will live in the 21st century , ' ' explains a blue-suited Toshiba hostess . ' ' Through technology lies the solution of all mankind ' s problems. ' ' // // The smiling Toshiba hostesses are going to be saying things like that a lot over the next six months . Under banners sporting slogans such as ' ' What man can dream , technology can achieve , ' ' Japan ' s science and technology festival , Expo ' 85 , is set to be launched Sunday . Toshiba , 27 other Japanese corporations , and nearly 50 foreign countries have carted out their most futuristic accomplishments to dazzle the 20 million people expected to flock here. // Much is still to be accomplished before the droves descend on Tsukuba , however . Many of the foreign pavilions , for instance , sit unfinished and behind schedule. // Some construction crews are working around the clock to complete them for Sunday ' s opening . The enormous Expo staff , many clad in a curious off-white garb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the next millenium ' s wonder world , have spent the last few days sweeping drifts of sawdust into bins and generally spiffing up the fairground. // In front of Suntory ' s endangered bird pavilion , scores of yellow-uniformed ' ' companion girls ' ' have been practicing their greeting in unison to the accompaniment of a synthesized bird chorus . Bolts of Astroturf wait to be unrolled in front of Crazy Ed ' s Roast Beef Hamburger. // At the Soviet pavilion , above the construction activity , sharp-eyed guides are shooing the curious away from an unfinished nuclear-fusion exhibit . US companies have just finished a final adjustment at their displays : Polaroid and Texas Instruments will play videotapes about the wonders of US technology - on Sony TV screens. // As international exhibits go , Expo ' 85 is no giant . Though roughly twice the size of a recent effort in New Orleans , it is dwarfed by earlier festivals at Japan ' s Osaka , Montreal , and New York . As a celebration of one country ' s love affair with technology , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Japanese , squeezed onto an island nation with few natural resources , have a unique tradition of embracing many technological advances as aids to survival . So interest in this type of event is usually strong : This is the third expo Japan has hosted since 1970. // ' ' Japanese people love these things , ' ' says Kinji Ohmae of the Expo ' 85 managing organization , the Japan Association for the International Exposition . ' ' Many will want to come over and over. ' ' // For those who do , Expo officials say they have stuffed enough pavilions into the 252-acre site to keep festival-goers busy for a minimum of four solid days. // At one company ' s outpost , a small army of singing , dancing , piano-playing robots plays for the visitors . Japan Air Lines ' s futuristic High-Speed Surface Transport , a rail system in which the cars are magnetically suspended above the track , makes its debut in another corner of the fairground . Nippon Telegraph and Telephone , Japan ' s soon-to-be-deregulated answer to Ma Bell , has devoted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a vast computer link that is supposed to help Japanese telecommunications leapfrog into the 21st century. // Nippon Electric Company has developed the world ' s biggest video game . The Japanese government is growing what is supposed to be the world ' s biggest tomato plant . Grown in water rather than soil and sustained by light carried through thousands of optical fiber filaments , the vine is supposed to reach a height of 33 feet , bearing 12 , 000 tomatoes before the festival ' s end. // The most eloquent statement by any pavilion here may come from Sony ' s monument to high technology : It is the world ' s largest television set , about the size of four tennis courts and best viewed about a quarter mile away. // Many observers fear the millions expected to make the 35-mile trek from Tokyo and other cities to see the attractions may overload Tsukuba ' s slender transportation links and even more inadequate hotel capacity . Last week , a sneak preview for 20 , 000 local residents resulted in a mile-long traffic jam . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s duration. // Amid this jumble of high-tech circus tents and low-tech traffic jams , the Japanese have a larger purpose . They want to trumpet their scientific achievement and have their nation regarded as a leader in basic research . But organizers also hope that such a spectacle will inject a little life into neighboring Tsukuba Science City , a brand new town intended to be a haven for Japanese research that strikes many of its residents as a bit dull. // Science City at Tsukuba was established by governmental fiat and represents a monumental investment of money , time , and effort . More than a trillion yen ( $3. 85 billion ) have been spent during the last 20 years to build , on what was once farmland , the world ' s best-equipped scientific complex . The 11 , 000 researchers toiling in the city ' s 46 research institutes and two universities account for nearly half of the government ' s scientists. // The purpose for all this activity was to refute the idea that Japan is coasting on other nations ' research efforts , rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made plans for Tsukuba. // It was supposed to be a dramatic break from the perceived rigidity of the traditional Japanese research environment . A staggering array of scientific investigation was to be held in one place . A new Tsukuba University was to be at the center of it all. // Many observers say Tsukuba ' s success in providing an alternative to the traditional Japanese research environment is mixed at best . Tsukuba has offered few of the amenities - shops , restaurants , and movie theaters - that many of Tsukuba ' s new inhabitants left behind. // ' ' It ( the Science City concept ) really is a good idea , ' ' says Toshio Murakami , a researcher in the radiology laboratories at the University of Tsukuba Medical School . ' ' But they put Tsukuba in the middle of nowhere. ' ' // Expo ' 85 , however , has brought with it a hive of activity . Roads have been widened , a new train station has been constructed , dozens of restaurants have sprouted up . Downtown Tsukuba now boasts a stylish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ robot shopping carts that obediently follow customers . An intense spurt of housing construction for Expo staff will mean a hefty amount of available housing once the festival closes . Government officials are hoping that such efforts , combined with the new roads and hotels , will lay the groundwork for Tsukuba ' s eventual development. // ' ' With Expo , the whole area will be more enjoyable , ' ' exalts Manabu Kuwae , who runs a newly built gas station near the fairground. // The fun will be fleeting , however . After Sept. 16 , the festival closes its gates , leaving Tsukuba on its own again . As if to emphasize the finality of that moment , the Ibaraki Prefecture government , which has jurisdiction over the region around Tsukuba , plans to raze all the pavilions and turn the fairground into an industrial park. // //
