For years Singapore 's family-planning program has used the slogan , " Two Is Enough . " The government 's policy worked so well that the fertility rate of the crowded island-state 's 2.6 million people is only 1.5 children per family . Now , however , Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew is concerned that the population will not be large enough to support the government 's long-term goals of becoming a high-tech , export-oriented country . Accordingly , an Interministerial Committee on Population is preparing proposals that will encourage Singapore 's couples to have more children . To kick off the new campaign , the government has coined a new slogan : " At Least Two . Better Three . Four If You Can Afford It . "
