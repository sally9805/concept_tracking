txt I do n't wish I lived in South Korea or Venezuela , but in one respect I envy people there : they get to see " Greatest Fights of the Century . " You remember " Greatest Fights . " In television 's early , early days ( between 1949 and 1955 ) the oldtime fight-film feature was aired after the Friday night fights . I liked the program so much I made my mother buy me Vaseline hair tonic , its sponsor , even though I had a crewcut . I 've long thought that the contrast between the " live " TV bout and the " great " fight afterward contributed to boxing 's decline in the late ' 50s . Thus , I am glad to report that Greatest Fights is still well , and lives on East 40th Street in New York . Its productions , under several titles , appear occasionally on U.S. On Sports by Frederick C. Klein television , mostly on cable networks , but they 're a tube staple in almost 100 countries around the globe , including the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ways . It manages several prizefighters and one of them , Wilfredo Benitez , the World Boxing Council 's junior-middleweight champ , is scheduled for one of those million-dollar Las Vegas paydays against Roberto Duran later this month . Even better , one of the guys who owns the company is Jim Jacobs , the four-wall handball champion of the ' 50s and ' 60s . If you have n't heard of Jim Jacobs , you should . He dominated his sport as few men have dominated theirs , winning a passel of U.S. ( that is , world ) singles and doubles titles over a dozen-year period . He was so good that a 1966 article in Sports Illustrated magazine seriously suggested that he might be the best athlete of his day in any sport . Mr. Jacobs , still trim and bouncy at age 51 , recalls the story with mixed feelings . He says he appreciated the compliment , but did n't care for the writer 's harping on his identification with Batman 's sidekick , Robin , hero of his boyhood , comic-book-collecting days . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says . " It made me appear I was still into kids ' stuff . " No siree , Jim says , by adulthood he had adopted the more grownup hobby of collecting fight films . " The more I got into athletics myself , the more I admired boxers , " he declares . " Theirs is the ultimate Individual sport , the one where emotional and psychological factors play the largest roles . A fighter has to deal with fear and its counterforce , courage , in a way no other athlete does . It 's what makes fighting and fighters so fascinating to me . " Mr. Jacobs combined his extensive handball-playing travels with searches for films of important old fights . It was n't easy , he says , partly because many of the movies were stored and forgotten because of a federal law , enacted in reaction to the race riots that accompanied the victories of Jack Johnson , the first black heavyweight champ . The law banned the interstate shipment of fight films between 1912 and 1940 ( I ) Also , a lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reproduced at considerable cost . Still , by 1961 he had accumulated several thousand prints and become the world 's foremost private collector . That year he merged his library with that of Bill Cayton , producer of the original Greatest Fight series , and joined Mr. Cayton ' S firm . Today , Greatest Fights owns some 16,000 fight movies , many times more than anyone else . Mr. Jacobs and Mr. Cayton make their living by splicing their films together in entertaining ways . Foreign television is their main customer , but many of the old-fight clips shown on domestic TV news and sports shows come from them . It 's a nice business , grossing about $10 million annually in all , and some of the work has earned artistic praise well . Greatest Fights has been nominated for two Academy awards for documentary films . To Mr. Jacobs , that 's gravy for a pursuit he still considers interesting in its own right . " The unique thing about fight films is that their quality is uniformly excellent , even the oldest ones , " he says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the small , fixed ring allowed the cameras to remain close and stationary . My oldest film  --  an 1894 bout involving James Corbett ? looks like it was made yesterday . Anytime I want I can see the greatest fighters of all time , just the way they looked . That makes boxing the only sport where performances really can be compared over long periods of time . " Though Mr. Jacobs is a connoisseur of boxing 's past , he is not its advocate . Today 's fighters are far-and-away the best ever , he believes . " Comparing them with the old-timers is like comparing a modern tank to the World War I models , " he says . ' " Fighters today are faster , stronger and know more , " he goes on . " It used to be that a left and a right together was a big-deal combination . Fighters now can put together six or eight punches in sequence . Look at the physiques on Sugar Ray Leonard and Tommy Hearns ! None of the old timers looked anything like that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days probably could hold their own today , but that 's about it . All was the greatest heavyweight ; he was faster at 215 pounds than the old timers were at 185 . Sugar Ray Robinson is still the greatest , pound for pound , but if Leonard keeps going the way he is , he 'll be the best . " He pauses and concludes : " That 's true in all sports ... probably even handball . "
