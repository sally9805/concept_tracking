DUBLIN , Calif.  --  Lucky Stores Inc. said it will close its ailing Gemco discount department-store division and sell most of the empty stores to a unit of Dayton Hudson Corp. , in a move Lucky said will give it net proceeds of about $450 million . The grocery-store chain said the sale is part of a comprehensive restructuring aimed at enhancing shareholder value , and may involve shedding three more specialty units . The moves also may be an attempt to thwart investor Asher Edelman , whose $35-a-share , or $1. 79 billion , bid to acquire the company was rebuffed by Lucky ' s board Monday . In rejecting the bid , the board said it was looking at options to realize shareholder value in the near term . In New York , Mr. Edelman said he was disappointed by Lucky ' s actions because the transaction would be taxable . He described the company ' s steps as " very advantageous to my getting the company because they won ' t maximize shareholder values . " Mr. Edelman is understood to favor a sale of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which would minimize taxes . He wouldn ' t comment on any plans to launch the takeover offer he has previously threatened . Lucky said it is examining alternatives for using proceeds from the Gemco transaction , including " various share repurchase plans , " which it didn ' t disclose . Investors weren ' t impressed , however , as the announcement sent Lucky shares down yesterday $1. 25 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading , to close at $36. 50 . " The market is saying that people don ' t have a lot of confidence " in the plan , said William N. Smith of Smith Barney , Harris Upham &; Co . While the cash from the transaction could theoretically " lend significant support " to the value of Lucky ' s stock if used in a buyback , he said , the company would " have to get a lot more specific " about their intentions before investors gain confidence of the plan ' s success . Details of the restructuring plan were sketchy , and Lucky officials couldn ' t be reached to elaborate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ California with a few in Arizona and Nevada , will be closed by year ' s end , and their inventory will be liquidated . The 17 , 000 Gemco employees , or 25% of Lucky ' s total work force , most of them unionized , will be dismissed in what the company called a " painful but necessary step . " Lucky said the Gemco transaction will garner proceeds of about $700 million . Of that , Minneapolis-based Dayton Hudson said its Target discount-store unit has agreed to pay $374 million to gain control of 54 of the 80 Gemco store buildings . It wasn ' t immediately clear how Lucky plans to dispose of the 26 remaining stores and the inventory in the entire chain , as well as how much it could generate from the disposals . The Dayton Hudson pact relieved Wall Street traders who had fretted that the retailer would be willing to pay twice as much for the entire Gemco operation . " It is a relatively small price to pay for what the deal does , " said Jeffrey B. Edelman , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trading yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange , Dayton Hudson closed at $42. 75 , up 25 cents . The 54 Gemco stores , which will be closed later this year and then reopened sometime next year by Target , will strengthen Target ' s position as the second-largest discount chain in southern California , behind K mart Corp . The acquisition also will move Target for the first time into the San Francisco Bay market with 12 store sites . The refitted stores would generate about $1 billion in annual revenue if they match the performance of the average Target store , which generates about $18 million in annual sales . " We believe these stores ought to do our average , " said Bruce G. Allbright , Target chairman and chief executive officer . Dayton Hudson will have to spend as much as $2 million to refit and stock each store , analysts said . But by buying empty stores , Dayton Hudson is avoiding the problems that depressed the Gemco operation . " This way the customer will know right off it isn ' t a Gemco @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Edward Weller , a retail analyst for E.F. Hutton &; Co . The way the pact is structured also allows Dayton Hudson to avoid dealing with Gemco ' s labor unions . The Target unit has no plans to directly hire Gemco employees because the stores will be closed for several months before they are reopened . Lucky also said its board authorized management to " actively explore " alternatives for its specialty stores ' operations , including spinning them off to shareholders or establishing them as separately owned entities . The specialty segment includes the company ' s 340 Hancock Fabrics stores , its 103 Yellow Front general stores , and the automotive parts division , which operates 380 stores under the Kragen or Checker names . Together , the three units had operating profit of $54. 1 million on sales of $728. 9 million for the year ended Feb. 2 . Smith Barney ' s Mr. Smith said that without additional information from the company on how it might structure a divestment , it would be " pure guesswork " to try to establish the move ' s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wall Street Journal
