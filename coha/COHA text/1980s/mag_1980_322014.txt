A chiller about blackmail <P> Dec. 13 . A package containing specifications for the construction of a hydrogen bomb has just been delivered to the White House , together with a cassette-recorded message from Libyan President Muammar Gaddafi . With rising horror , the mansion 's current resident , a decent but untested Southerner , listens to the ultimatum on the tape : If the U.S. does not make Israel withdraw from the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem within 36 hours , a nuclear device concealed in New York City will be detonated by satellite command . <P> <P> The scene , of course , is fiction . No portable nuclear bomb awaited triggering ; President Gaddafi , for all his Israelophobia , had taped no such doomsday threat . Yet for thousands of French readers the scenario seems icily plausible . The Fifth Horseman is France 's hottest bestseller this winter only four weeks after publication . ( The book will be published in the U.S. by Simon &; Schuster in July . ) Co-Authors Larry Collins and Dominique Lapierre ( Is Paris Burning ? , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the details of civilization 's vulnerability to nuclear blackmail appear totally realistic . <P> Collins , 50 , an American and a former Newsweek bureau chief in Paris , and Frenchman Lapierre , 48 , a former editor at Paris-Match , spent four years interviewing and researching for the book on five continents , producing what they call " research-fiction . " In the process , they talked with U.S. nuclear scientists at Los Alamos , civil defense experts in New York , Arab students in Europe and North Africa , and Israeli generals , not to mention a brace of agents from the CIA , Israel 's Mossad and the S.D.E.C.E. , the French secret service . <P> They even hired a former police officer to introduce them to the gamy underworld of New York pickpockets and ID-card fixers . Gaddafi was selected as the fictional blackmailer , explains Lapierre , " because he was not susceptible to U.S. reprisals , having such a small population and all that sand . " <P> Its wealth of factual information gives the book the air more of crackling investigative journalism than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Fifth Horseman-the important exception being the U.S. President-are identified and living people . Israeli Premier Menachem Begin 's daughter Hassia plays the piano in the family 's Jerusalem apartment ; France 's President Valry Giscard d'Estaing has a secret meeting with his top aides to discuss energy matters . <P> But the most hair-raising detail is the revelation that there have actually been more than 50 attempts at nuclear blackmail in the U.S. ; that figure is confirmed by Washington officials , although they note that all were hoaxes or extortion attempts and that no nuclear device was ever involved . The authors claim that one of the blackmail ploys , supposedly hatched by Palestinians , forced President Gerald Ford in the spring of 1974 to consider the evacuation of Boston . Officials in Boston and Washington admit that Ford did know of such a threat , but that they never could identify who was behind it . No evacuation was ever considered .
