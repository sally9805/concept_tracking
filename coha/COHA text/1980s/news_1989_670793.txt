Coincidentally , it has the potential to be one of the best museums of 19th-century American art in the country . From the moment it was founded in 1826 by Samuel F. B. Morse , Thomas Cole , Asher B. Durand and others , the National Academy aimed to enroll the best American artists of the day among its membership . And from then until the arrival of American modernism , it largely succeeded. // It got the painters , and it also got the sculptors who are now coming back into favor . It got their work by mandatory presentation , but it also got it by bequest and by spontaneous gift . And in 1865 , it acquired the entire collection of James Augustus Suydam ( 1819-65 ) . Suydam had money . He was talented enough as a landscape painter to be admitted to membership of the academy . In the last 10 years of his life , he made a careful choice of 28 European and 55 American paintings and bequeathed them to the academy. // Many of the works of art in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eakins self-portrait , Durand ' s " Morning of Life " ( part Claude Lorrain , part costume party ) , the bust of Emerson by Daniel Chester French , the Winslow Homer " Croquet Players , " the wonderfully evocative portrait of two well-born idlers by Robert Frederick Blum ( 1857-1903 ) and ( this critic ' s all-time favorite ) the portrait of Charles Courtney Curran by his colleague and contemporary William J. Whittemore ( 1860-1955 ) . // The image of Curran is irresistible . Formally dressed , with high white collar , well-trimmed beard , tall pristine hat and scholarly glasses , he dabs away at his canvas with long thin brushes . To the voluptuous image , just inches away , of a naked young woman in white marble , he pays no attention whatever . Never was professional dedication more deftly celebrated. // But it is the point of the academy ' s current show - " An American Collection , " sponsored by Northern Telecom Inc. - that the academy ' s resources are both enormous and largely unknown . Of the more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half seem never to have been on exhibition before . For every work in the show , 9 or 10 others are in storage. // Even if we allow for a large proportion of painters and sculptors who may never make the history books , and for some who might barely make it into a good thrift shop , this is a collection well worth investigation . Abigail Booth Gerdts , the curator of the academy ' s collection , has put together a show that is all the more enlightening for not sticking to either coherence or chronology . ( A landscape by Jane Freilicher hangs next to a portrait by Julian Alden Weir , for instance . ) Only when touring the Suydam bequest , which brings the show to a close , do we feel that a specific taste , nurtured at a specific moment , is in control. // Elsewhere , we never know what will come up , except that a room on the third floor is dedicated , more or less , to the American West . This visitor was very touched by the affectionate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ artist by another - the Augustus Saint-Gaudens plaster relief of Francis David Millett , the portrait of Alexander Stirling Calder by Robert Henri , the portrait of Maxfield Parrish by Kenyon Cox , and the George Bellows of Paul Manship . These were ample , open , straightforward affections , and the fact comes out in the work . ( A more recent example , comparable in its humanity , is Will Barnet ' s " Kiesler ' s Last Request . " ) To get the most out of this show , it is important to stay alert . If occasionally it comes on like a high-level tag sale , keep going . Round the next corner , better things await us , like the white marble head of a young woman by John Clements Gregory that is dated 1930 and could have come straight from a novel by Michael Arlen , or the Neo-Classical self-portrait , dated 1826 , by John Frazee , a founder member of the academy. // " An American Collection " remains at the National Academy of Design , 1083 Fifth Avenue , at 89th @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Riopelle : Paintings From the 50 ' <> Pierre Matisse Gallery <> 41 East 57th Street <> Through May 20 // Forty years ago , there were those in Paris who thought that abstract painting was not only the best thing that could have happened , but the only thing that could give the School of Paris a fresh start and a new international image . Painters like Tal Coat , Jean Fautrier and Mathieu were strongly backed , therefore , as was also a newcomer , born in Montreal in 1923 , called Jean-Paul Riopelle. // In 1949 , Riopelle was shown in a group exhibition at a dealer ' s gallery in Paris with Jackson Pollock , Mark Rothko and Mark Tobey . Sam Francis and Norman Bluhm were also in Paris . The Parisian art world was small , in those days , and Franco-American camaraderie was in its heyday. // Veterans of the period do not forget the tapering slabs of pure color that Riopelle laid onto the canvas with a palette knife . There were other elements , initially - among them a long , thin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But the flat , tautly sprung motion of the knife was the motor force. // This was a new kind of painting - or so it seemed . It was not landscape . It abjured the illusion of depth . A hectic overlap that emphasized the flat surface of the canvas , it lived in and for itself , with no reference to things seen anywhere else . The flat , schematic vision was closer to that of the cartographer or of the aerial reconnaissance photograph than to that of the atmospheric landscapist. // Riopelle ' s current show at the Pierre Matisse Gallery gives a full and fair account of his procedures at that time ( 1950-55 ) . As historical documents , the larger paintings hold up well . When they are too big , they slither and slide . When they are too small , the idiom does not have enough room to get into top gear . But when the energy is corraled and contained within just the right space , they stand firm and square for a certain moment in time. // They date , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and never pretty , they sometimes have a rather dour , postwar look and are none the worse for it . After 40 years in which abstract painting has been put through every conceivable hoop , their idiom speaks for a genuine effort by a genuine man . <> <> ' The Eiffel Tower , a Tour de Force ' <> Grolier Club <> 47 East 60th Street <> Through June 3 // Art has always done well by the Eiffel Tower , and vice versa . Even before it was finished , painter , printmaker and photographer went to work . It is the metropolitan subject - perhaps the only one - that never stales and never goes out of date. // To accommodate a most amusing , instructive and resourceful investigation of the tower and its history , the Grolier Club has had to depart somewhat from its normally august parameters. // Inkwell and paper knife , sheet music and souvenir candlestick - all find a place alongside art that is sometimes high ( Robert Delaunay , above all ) and sometimes not . The Eiffel Tower is art for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for which Dennis Cate and Norbert Schimmel were organizers . <> <> ' The Case for Plywood ' <> Luise Ross Gallery <> 50 West 57th Street <> Through May 17 // By general consent , plywood as a medium is about as low as you can get . But it ' s cheap , and the artist can bend it ( literally ) to his will. // Some of the pieces in this inventive mixed show take plywood direct from its everyday uses , as when Robert Younger sets a yellow-painted lyre on top of a rickety wooden perch . Others coax it into predictable shapes , as in the two round objects that nuzzle each other on the floor in Heide Fasnacht ' s " Cynosure . " When you get out of the elevator , don ' t miss Judith Cotton ' s black and white palm tree on the wall in front of you . Wit and economy work well together in this show. //
