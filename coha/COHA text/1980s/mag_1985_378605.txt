The Cabinet members cheering Ronald Reagan 's triumphant return to Washington from Geneva last week provided the appearance of an Administration united behind his summit success . Such homecoming harmony , however , was preceded by internal rivalries that lasted right up to the President 's departure for his first meeting with a Soviet leader and threatened to undermine his negotiating credibility . Reagan was furious when he learned that a letter from Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger , urging him to hang tough on arms control , had been leaked to the New York Times and the Washington Post . The President 's mood did not improve after an unidentified White House official accommodated newsmen by replying to a question as to whether the leak was an attempt to sabotage the U.S. bargaining stance : " Sure it was . " <P> The letter was the covering note attached to a Pentagon study that Reagan had requested on alleged Soviet violations of past arms agreements . In a somewhat patronizing tone , Weinberger cautioned his Commander in Chief against making any concessions to Mikhail Gorbachev that would " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to strict compliance with the antiballistic missile treaty of 1972 , warned Weinberger , could eventually hamper progress on the President 's vaunted Strategic Defense Initiative . That militant position was hardly a new one for Weinberger , but the timing of his latest warning gave the Soviets an opening to charge that the U.S. plans to abrogate the only fully ratified arms treaty between the superpowers . Sure enough , the Soviets ' Georgi Arbatov promptly stated that the letter proved Reagan was " not serious " about the summit . The flap soon subsided , however , and its eventual role at the summit was minimal . <P> Who leaked the letter ? Early speculation centered on Richard Perle , Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Policy and the Administration 's most ardent critic of arms control . Perle flatly denied that he was the source of the leak . Defense Department officials pointed out that the leaked letter bore Weinberger 's nickname signature " Cap , " while the copies distributed to Perle and others in the Pentagon were unsigned : the implication was that it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point , perhaps , but by week 's end Washington insiders were convinced that other players had more motive for mischief . Said Maine 's Republican Senator William Cohen : " You can just as easily assume it was the liberals trying to embarrass the President into a negotiating posture as you can believe it was conservatives trying to forestall concessions . " <P> While the leak was tame by Washington standards , failure to classify the letter made it all the easier for editors of the two papers to justify its publication . Indeed , some observers speculated that Weinberger himself wanted his missive made public , particularly since so many copies were dispatched around the Government . Said Thomas Longstreth , associate director of the privately funded Arms Control Association : " By sending it unclassified , Weinberger intended it to be leaked . " The Secretary denies any such purpose . " I ca n't recall that I 've ever classified a letter I 've given the President , " he told TIME last week . " I can only think that somebody felt this would be an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
