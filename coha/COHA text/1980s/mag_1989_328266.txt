The claim was so spectacular that it was difficult to believe . News reports suggested that scientists might have achieved the world 's first controlled , energy-yielding nuclear-fusion reaction  --  a Holy Grail of physics for nearly 40 years . Moreover , the event had not occurred in one of the great national laboratories ; it was the work of a pair of chemists operating on a shoestring budget and using little more than a test tube , a pencil-thin strip of metal and a car battery . Even more incredible was the assertion that this humble apparatus , fueled with a form of hydrogen found in ordinary seawater , had generated four times as much energy as it consumed . Could this be a new and virtually limitless source of cheap , clean power ? <P> Thus late last month began a saga that continues to engage the attention of the scientific world as rarely before . The announcement by the two chemists , B. Stanley Pons of the University of Utah and Martin Fleischmann of the University of Southampton in England , while greeted with skepticism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to re-create the controversial experiment . <P> There were grounds for skepticism . While well respected in their fields , Pons and Fleischmann were far from the mainstream of fusion research . In addition , they had released their results in a manner that tended to cast suspicion on their claims , staging a press conference in Utah complete with television cameras . For several days researchers around the world were dependent on TV and newspapers for scraps of information about what could conceivably be the biggest science story of the year  --  if not the decade . <P> Then the details of the experiment began to emerge . By an informal process known as " publication by fax , " copies of a paper Pons and Fleischmann had prepared began to circulate from lab to lab . Next , one of the best-known figures in the field , physicist Steven Jones of Brigham Young University , announced that he too had achieved fusion in a jar , although , significantly , with far lower energy output . Even a pair of Hungarian scientists claimed to have carried out room-temperature fusion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Dutch scientific journal pushed forward its schedule and published the report by Pons and Fleischmann . But at week 's end the more prestigious British journal Nature had not yet decided whether to print their findings . The scientific community , while not at all convinced by the claim that the power of the H-bomb had finally been harnessed , was at least taking it seriously . <P> Nuclear fusion , the process that fires the sun , usually occurs when two atoms are squeezed together at very high temperatures to make one new atom . For example , two atoms of deuterium  --  an isotope of hydrogen  --  can be fused to form a helium atom and a neutron , releasing a sizable burst of energy . But before that can occur , deuterium nuclei generally need to be compressed with sufficient force to overcome their mutually repellent electrical charges . In H-bombs , that force is supplied by the detonation of an A-bomb . Conventional fusion techniques require giant magnets , powerful laser beams and particle accelerators . But none of these approaches have succeeded in generating more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
