LA VIA DEL TREN SUBTERRANEO ES PELIGROSA . The sign appears in nearly every subway car along New York City 's 230-mile system . Literally translated from Spanish , it means , " The subterranean train track is dangerous . " Though it refers to the electrified third rail and not to the dangers inside the trains , few New Yorkers would argue with its broader implications . Fewer still , however , have seen the sign recently . It has been obscured in most cars by coat after coat of indecipherable graffiti . <P> New York City 's subways , the subject of innumerable horror stories , conjure up hellish images in the minds of out-of-towners . But while many crimes occur in the tangle below ground , the 81-year-old , 24-hour-a-day system faithfully carries about a billion riders a year , three-quarters of the nation 's rapid- transit passengers . An average of 38 felonies are committed each day , only 2.6% of the city 's total crime . <P> Lurking behind the statistics are daily degradations that account for the dread most New Yorkers feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is astounding that residents of one of the world 's greatest cities must submit to a daily assault of subterranean sights , sounds and smells so fraught with menace . At rush hour in the Times Square station , where eight of the city 's busy lines converge , a man urinates against a wall , loudly talking to no one in particular . On one platform , waiting passengers cover their ears as a mass of hurtling steel comes screeching from the blackness of the tunnel beyond . Smoke from a fire on a distant track wafts through the station . A crowded train from the Upper West Side sits simmering on another track for 20 minutes while static from a broken speaker drowns out the conductor 's incomprehensible explanation . " I 'm afraid to get in that subway system even when I 'm with my bodyguard , " says Senator Alfonse D'Amato , a Long Islander . " Even my bodyguard is afraid . " Although it was clearly an overstatement ( " I think he should change his bodyguard , " retorted Mayor Edward Koch ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's fiscal crisis and the cutbacks of the 1970s , the elderly subway system has been in decline . A report done by the Straphangers ' Campaign , a consumer-advocacy group , showed that one out of five cars had bad lighting . Ridership on the system is down by about half since it peaked at 2 billion in the late 1940s . The National Transportation Safety Board announced last week that the system is courting catastrophe because of its failure to deal with track fires . Last month alone , there were at least 465 of them . <P> Since February , transit police have guaranteed that there will be one officer on every train from 8 p.m. to 6 a.m . They have instituted sweeps of subway stations , a kind of underground rapid-deployment force that in 33 months has detected 9,000 incidents of crime . The current transit police force , which has 3,800 officers , is the largest ever for New York and the biggest in the country . Meanwhile , with subway workers threatening another strike , passengers are just hoping the trains will keep running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rider . " It 's New York . "
