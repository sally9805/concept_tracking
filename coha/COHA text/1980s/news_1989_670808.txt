The crackdown in China against pro-democracy demonstrators and the tensions in Chinese-American relations that have followed have deterred many American scholars from venturing to China and prevented many Chinese scholars from venturing out of their country . Even if travel continues unabated , Chinese scholars and officials may be less willing to talk freely in the less tolerant atmosphere now prevailing in their country. // The National Academy of Sciences has suspended its three major exchange programs with China to protest the use of Chinese troops against demonstrators in Tiananmen Square . The suspension affects about 200 American and Chinese scholars. // The academy has urged 30 American scholars in China under its sponsorship to come home . It also postponed a symposium in Shanghai on gene research that would have had 15 American speakers and 200 participants from all over China . <> <> Exchanges in Doubt // Several other academy exchanges are also in doubt : a visiting scholars exchange program , for example , that annually sends 35 Americans to China and 30 Chinese to the United States for one to three months , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought 15 Chinese scholars to the United States in September. // Hundreds of other scholars travel on their own with university or private sponsorship , and many of these have also had to change their plans. // " Everybody who is involved in the exchanges with China in academic work is very upset at the negative impact this will potentially have on both American access to China and Chinese access to America , " said David M. Lampton , president of the National Committee on United States-China Relations. // Mr. Lampton is a political scientist who , in 1982 , studied Chinese river planning and discovered that , despite China ' s totalitarian system , regulation of the environment is not well centralized , a shortcoming that has resulted in polluted water supplies and wasted arable land . Such a study would not have been carried out , he suggested , had not Chinese officials been open and candid with him. // Though its numbers are uncertain , the exchange of scholars with China is the largest the United States has with any Communist country , said Peggy Blumenthal , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ largest international exchange program in the United States . <> <> Fears About the Impact // " Chinese scholars have important contributions to make in scientific and other fields and for us to cut off communications with them hurts our own scholarship and slows down the rate of scholarship everywhere , " she said. // In the last decade of information exchanges between scholars in the United States and China , American scientists have helped China protect its pepper and tobacco crops against a devastating virus and taught the Chinese how to build an advanced collider to study subatomic particles. // In turn , the Americans have learned about a Chinese drug that reportedly has been effective in destroying cells containing the AIDS virus , and a Chinese graduate student working in the United States discovered a new material that can be used in high-temperature superconductors . American social scientists have been able to scrutinize the workings of the Chinese Communist Party. // Now , there is fear that a freeze in American relations with China may cut effectively sever links between these two communities , by limiting the travels of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to speak freely. // Science and scholarship thrive on exchanges of information unimpeded by national boundaries . Journal articles are one way of communicating , but face-to-face meetings of scholars , informally , at conferences or in laboratories , are as essential . <> <> No Substitute for Contacts // " There is no substitute for getting together on an informal basis with colleagues doing the same kind of work you are doing , " said Dr. Jules B. LaPidus , president of the Council of Graduate Schools , which represents 400 graduate schools. // Just as important as formal conferences , he said , is " what takes place in the hallways and restaurants where you find groups of people who don ' t usually see each other sit down and draw on the back of envelopes and write equations and talk about what actually happens in the laboratory and ask their colleagues , ' Have you tried this ? ' or ' Have you got any ideas about that ? ' " // One group for whom access to China and its officials is vital are the American historians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Kyna Rubin , a professional associate with the National Academy ' s Committee on Scholarly Communications With the People ' s Republic of China . American political scientists have even been allowed to examine Chinese government operations and economists have been studying the economic reforms. // " One would suspect that ' s not going to be as easy to examine as it was before June 4 , " she said . " For Americans trying to learn about China , to be denied access to China takes us back to the 1950 ' s , 60 ' s and 70 ' s when you had to study China from afar rather than first-hand. " // American scientists in China have been using the silkworm as a tool in genetic and other biological experiments . They have been studying erosion and the spread of deserts . " American geologists are crazy about Tibet " and its distinctive , often inaccessible geological formations , said Jane Liu Jernow , who directs the Committee on Scholarly Communication ' s science program. // Chinese land specialists are still scheduled to come here to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Speak Freely // All such research has been jeopardized by the current atmosphere in China that makes Chinese more reluctant to speak their minds. // There are no precise figures on how many people and programs will be affected , since hundreds of scholars come to the United States or travel to China on their own . China has not yet closed its doors to Americans . American universities are still urging Chinese colleagues who have trips scheduled for the coming academic year to show up on schedule. // Still , how readily China will let its scholars out of the country , and the willingness of those scholars to speak freely with Americans is in doubt. // " We are concerned about the scholarly environment in China , if it is conducive for American research or if there ' s an environment of intimidation against the Chinese academic community , " said Ms. Rubin . " How productive can our students and scholars be if libraries are closed , if the archives are closed , if Chinese colleagues are inaccessible ? " // American research may also be set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and postdoctoral fellows , who are often some of the most able researchers at many university graduate mathematics , physics and chemistry departments , U.S. Workshops in China In scientific exchanges , experts say , Americans have probably been teaching Chinese scientists far more than the Americans have learned from them . Scientific research in China was practically halted during the Cultural Revolution of 1966 to 1976 and China lost pace with the rest of the world . In recent years , Americans , taking their own equipment and chemical agents , have gone to China and run workshops on gene cloning and immunotoxins to acquaint the Chinese with newly developing areas of science. // Dr. Dean H. Hamer , a research scientist for the National Cancer Institute who arranged three such workshops in 1987 and 1988 , said that Chinese scientists at the Institute of Microbiology in Beijing , using biological engineering techniques absorbed from the West , have produced an attenuated strain of a virus , the cucumber mosaic , that devastated crops . The new strain immunizes pepper , tobacco and some fruits against the virus . Thousands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said. // Americans have also capitalized on their contacts with China in experiments with drugs that might help fight AIDS and cancer. // Chou Wen-chung , a professor of musical composition at Columbia University , says the new atmosphere in China may impede the kind of cultural exchanges that brought the violinist Isaac Stern and the playwright Arthur Miller to China and enlightened American scholars about Chinese concepts and forms in music. // " The situation is rather tragic , " he said , " because it was happening at a time when things are changing both for Chinese intellectuals and Western scholars.
