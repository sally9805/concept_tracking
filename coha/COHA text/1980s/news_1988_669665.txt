It is one of history ' s great reversals . And yet it is the utterly logical consequence of four decades of the balance of terror . Even as the prospect of nuclear annihilation has made general war unthinkable , so has this prospect made unthinkable for the leaders of the United States and Soviet Union the kind of indulgent political hostility that might erupt into nuclear war. // It was no smooth evolution that led to the present expectation of an arms control agreement cutting the superpowers ' strategic arsenals by 50 percent . It was instead a turbulent , dialectical process . The Soviets needed first to discover that their economy was in crisis and that they could not press a military advantage in the third world in the ' 70s without triggering a profound reaction in the United States . The Americans needed first to discover that they could not restore American nuclear superiority through technical wizardry in space in the ' 80s. // // Technologically , the nuclear standoff of the post-World War II era depended on a perversely benign ' ' deterrence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vulnerable populations and mutually invulnerable weapons . There was no known defense against the awesome destructiveness of nuclear weapons . Thus , any nuclear war would yield no winners , but only joint victims of a suicide pact. // Under this existential threat the two superpowers practice unwonted caution on that plot of earth that was most important to both : Europe . By fall of 1988 , the standoff will have given Western Europe more than 43 years of peace , its longest reprieve in 2 , 000 years of bloody history. // In those 43 years , however , there were Berlin , Cuban , and Mideast crises that made the superpowers wonder if their cold war was going to turn radioactively hot . After several such scares , they moved to reduce volatility and enhance stability in the Antiballistic Missile Treaty ( SALT ) of 1972. // But then each side sought to break out of the stalemate - Moscow by exporting Cuban soldiers to Africa and Soviet soldiers to Afghanistan , Washington by a ' ' star wars ' ' program that might restore US nuclear superiority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ star wars and its failure formed the essential catalyst - in the atmosphere of the new Soviet sense of domestic crisis - that stimulated the US and the Soviet Union to reaccept the stalemate and seek the more durable accommodation that now looks possible. // Star wars was President Reagan ' s impetuous dream , launched in a speech in 1983 , of reversing the four decades of the balance of terror . His Strategic Defense Initiative - SDI to the cognoscente , star wars to the laymen - aimed to erect in space the elusive defense that could at long last intercept attacking missiles . If it worked , it would for the first time in two generations end that utter vulnerability of populations and aggregate invulnerability of nuclear weapons , to make people secure and weapons insecure. // The catch was that to do this it had to operate all but perfectly . Failures of 25 percent , or 10 percent , or even 1 percent , in stopping 10 , 000 incoming warheads , each with 20 or 50 times the blast of that baby A-bomb at Hiroshima @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the face of it , the mission was impossible . Yet Mr. Reagan ' s single speech altered the political landscape . It powerfully focused minds in Moscow on the precarious balance of opportunities and risks in the nuclear era. // If the Soviets had not already felt themselves to be in crisis , the gleam of star wars in Reagan ' s eye might not have alarmed them as much as it did . But SDI aggravated their existing fears : that the Soviet Union might fall even further behind in the whole technological race , that the arms rivalry in space might absorb so many resources that it would abort economic modernization , that by the 21st century the nation might become a has-been as a superpower. // Soviet officials claimed from the beginning that they could and would counter any US deployment of SDI by simply overwhelming it with a cheaper proliferation of warheads - and rationally they believed their own words . Emotionally , however , they were nagged by doubts . What if the US deployed a rudimentary SDI system that would not be very effective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Union - but would be highly effective offensively in guaranteeing a crippling US first strike on Soviet missiles by deflecting the Soviet Union ' s subsequent ' ' ragged retaliation ' ' ? And where would Moscow get the money to compete in space ? // As Soviet strategists mulled over the unequal contest , a funny thing happened . All the deterrent verities about stability and assured second strike and the destabilizing , trigger-happy nature of the strategic defense that US arms controllers had preached in the ' 70s suddenly made a great deal more sense to the Soviets of the ' 80s . In the end they began propounding the old US precepts that Moscow had shucked off in veering toward a more Soviet view of the nuclear competition . More and more in the negotiations , Moscow ' s tacit aims converged with those of classical Western arms control even as Reagan ' s aims diverged from them. // Thus , if the Soviets sought to rule out a US first-strike capability , they had to sacrifice their own first-strike capability . If they sought to constrain the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to constrain their own heavy missiles for the same period - and champion the strict interpretation of the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty that they had originally evaded and Reagan now wished to evade. // If they sought US predictability and gradualism in the arms race to ensure that crisis outlays for weapons would not rob their civilian economy , they had to forfeit any nasty surprises of their own . If they were going to deter the US , they had to let the US deter them . And to consummate the bargain that SDI and perestroika made them want so badly , they had to accept two principles that had hitherto been taboo : intrusive on-site inspection and ( at least in the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces ( INF ) Treaty the two sides signed last December and ratified in May ) asymmetrical destruction of weapons. // It took a man of Mikhail Gorbachev ' s daring , speed , and tactical shrewdness to bring the Soviet Union to such uncharacteristic acts. // His innovations started in one of the more discretionary areas of foreign relations , policy toward the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , more recently , Latin America ) had undergone nine previous swings of the pendulum in Soviet history , and the 10th was already in process when Mr. Gorbachev stepped in , so he found it easy just to add momentum. // The swing was from left to right , away from infatuation with Marxist-Leninist fanatics who tended to ruin their impoverished economies and then expect the Soviet Union to rescue them , to flirtation with the more successful , if more bourgeois , nations lurching toward prosperity and regional importance. // Soviet disenchantment with distant self-styled Marxist-Leninists reflected pure national interest . The price of imperium was exorbitant , running to $40 billion or $45 billion a year in the early ' 80s , in Western estimates . Ingratitude was rife , as the Guineas and Ghanas kept following the path of Yugoslavia and China and Egypt in turning against their patron . And various clients that remained loyal also remained embarrassing : By abusing their economies so egregiously , Mozambique and especially Ethiopia were giving socialism a bad name in the rest of the third world . The Indias @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WHEN new opportunities beckoned , then , the Russians cast a gimlet eye on them . They did not meddle in troubled Haiti or the Philippines or South Africa . They did not foment Baluchi separatism in Pakistan . They did not embrace the prickly Muam-mar Qaddafi more closely . They moved circumspectly in the Gulf . And even though they relished the nuisance value of the Sandinistas in Washington , they kept aid to Nicaragua at a modest $250 million over the first half of the ' 80s , a level below US support for guerrillas in Afghanistan . Afghanistan , with its heavy Soviet investment of blood and treasure , was the most vexing Soviet dilemma in the third world . Yet even here Gorbachev drew the logical conclusions about what he called a ' ' bleeding wound . ' ' After eight long years of doing no more than holding the administrative centers of towns against the encroaching mujahideen , Moscow moved to retreat , without insisting that the successor government in Kabul be pro-Soviet . With this decision Gorbachev became the first Soviet leader ever to put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ record of the irreversible tide of history toward Soviet-style socialism . The Soviet superpower , too , it seemed , could have its Vietnam . Soviet withdrawal impressed the US , and suggested that Moscow might not again risk a new detente for ephemeral victories in developing countries as it had done in the ' 70s. // Viscerally , retrenchment was hardest on the fringe of empire . Oddly , it was far easier in the apocalyptic but disembodied world of nuclear weapons. // Under Gorbachev , military policy quickly became a function of his overriding economic priority . His pet perestroika , or economic overhaul , would have no chance if an unconstrained arms race turned into a black hole for rubles . Yet Reagan had demonstrated that the US would not be outspent in defense . And NATO had demonstrated in deploying Euromissiles in the early ' 80s that a Trotskyite appeal to antinuclear peace movements in the West over the heads of their elected leaders would not work . The only way to get the breathing space the Soviet Union needed was to negotiate with Western governments in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conclusion more elegantly , Gorbachev began stressing within a year of taking office the need for ' ' new thinking ' ' in security and awareness of the ' ' interdependence ' ' of states in the nuclear era . Unilateral security is no longer possible , he told the 27th Communist Party Congress in early 1986 ; it must be mutual or it will not endure . Nor can military means or even military parity ensure security in the absence of political accommodation and deference to the ' ' genuine national interests ' ' of the US. // Later that year , Gorbachev stopped voicing the old Soviet demand for ' ' equality and equal security ' ' - a formula that usually meant insistence on a right to Soviet power equal to the combined forces of the US , Western Europe , and China - and began substituting for it the far less ominous goal of ' ' reasonable sufficiency . ' ' ' ' Sufficiency ' ' remained a vague yardstick. // But Gorbachev specified that he had in mind arsenals appreciably smaller than current US and Soviet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ military spending . Gone was the standard open-ended promise to give the generals ' ' everything necessary to reliably defend the homeland . ' ' Indeed , Gorbachev ' s new party program sounded a parsimonious note in calling only for a modest ' ' level that excludes strategic superiority by the forces of imperialism. ' ' // GORBACHEV encountered less overt opposition to his ' ' new thinking ' ' than Leonid Brezhnev had engendered earlier with his more timid innovations about the impossibility of achieving nuclear superiority or victory. // No Politburo member made dark allusions to the high cost that detente was exacting in breaching secrecy with on-site inspection , condoning treason in the emigration of 400 , 000 able bodies , eroding discipline by releasing dissidents and stopping the jamming of foreign radio broadcasts , and undermining social mobilization by blurring the image of enemy encirclement . The new consensus was too strong - not necessarily on the specifics of Gorbachev ' s program , but on the general thesis that drastic measures of some sort were needed after the immobilism and drift of the previous decade. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later Brezhnev years - apparently shared in the new consensus . Its acquiescence derived in part from the conviction that only immediate rejuvenation of the civilian economy could guarantee the base for better weapons later - and that only a breathing space abroad could make that regeneration feasible. // Besides , the quirks of superpower relations made those old American axioms of deterrence and stability now appear not as fetters on Soviet missiles , but as fetters on the threatening US SDI program . The new Soviet stress on the importance of both sides ' maintenance of a retaliatory nuclear capability began to sound reminiscent of the kind of stability and finite limit to nuclear procurement defined by US Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara 20 years earlier as ' ' mutual assured destruction. ' ' // Nor did the Russians , this time around , boast as Brezhnev had done in the detente of the ' 70s that the ' ' correlation of forces ' ' was turning in their favor . They knew now that nuclear deterrence could not long survive new Cuban expeditions in Africa or virulent anti-Semitism in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Western meddling in their sovereign affairs , they increased Jewish emigration to facilitate the new detente , freed several hundred dissidents , and transferred the notorious psychiatric wards of the KGB secret police to the regular health service. // With at least a particle of consensus on a new course , then , Gorbachev gambled on Reagan , the declared archenemy of the communists but the man who , like Richard Nixon , could deliver the American right in ratification of arms control . The two superpowers negotiated the INF Treaty as a kind of test case , then plunged ahead with the crucial strategic talks. // Simultaneously , the American right discovered that its dream of restoring US nuclear superiority through SDI was a technological and financial pipe dream . The core of the right reaccepted the stalemate the right had denounced so vehemently before it had its own crack at breakout , and failed. // For his part , Reagan never acknowledged that his SDI program was far more effective as a catalyst to reevaluation of old thinking than as a nuclear shield . But he came to learn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He decided that the Soviet ' ' evil empire ' ' he had railed against belonged to a bygone era . He went to Moscow last month calling Gorbachev his friend . Perestroika was nurtured . For the rest of the century predictability and stability were at least given the benefit of the doubt. // The cold war , some veteran Washington observers began to hope , might even be over. // //
