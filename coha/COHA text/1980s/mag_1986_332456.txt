Like many African leaders , Zambian President Kenneth Kaunda has repeatedly called for economic sanctions against South Africa . He has even threatened to withdraw from the Commonwealth if Britain fails to punish Pretoria . Yet Kaunda 's country can ill afford sanctions . Landlocked Zambia , already suffering through its worst recession since independence in 1964 , buys much of its industrial and agricultural equipment from Pretoria and has almost two- thirds of its non-oil imports shipped through South Africa . If the West were to impose sanctions on South Africa , economic necessity , compounded by a sense of vengeance , would probably move Pretoria to stop all those exports , virtually paralyzing Zambia . Kaunda has admitted that " many of us would suffer , and perhaps starve . " <P> That sad paradox is repeated , indeed intensified , throughout the black nations of the region . Botswana , Lesotho and Swaziland depend upon Pretoria for all their oil . Lesotho gets all its electricity from South Africa . Almost every export and import of the three countries travels through South Africa . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within the continent have risen by 40% this year , and promise to reach a record $800 million . Any Western blow against South Africa could amount to a killer blow against many of the so-called frontline states . Warns a South African diplomat in London : " Whereas it would take years , perhaps longer , to bring South Africa 's economy to its knees , those of the frontline states could be in shambles within months . " <P> In addition , South Africa has threatened that it might retaliate against sanctions by expelling the 350,000 contract laborers from neighboring black states who hold down jobs within the country . Since each migrant worker supports an estimated six people at home , roughly 2 million black Africans would be quickly stripped of their livelihood . Tiny Lesotho , to take one example , would not only be flooded with 140,000 returning workers , equivalent to more than 75% of its wage-labor force , but would also be deprived of their salary remittances , which currently exceed the country 's entire gross domestic product . Earlier this year South Africa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which had been harboring anti-Pretoria activists . South Africa put up an economic blockade , and within 19 days there was a military takeover . <P> Many Western countries , therefore , fear that if they do impose sanctions on South Africa , they will have to bail out the black nations struck by South African reprisals . The U.S. has already made it clear to the frontline states that it can not compensate them for their possible losses . Britain , whose ties with southern Africa are even closer , has been still firmer . When Zimbabwean Prime Minister Robert Mugabe called for South African sanctions at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting last October , British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher replied with a stern and stinging warning . " If you want to cut your own throat , " she said , " do n't come to me for a bandage . "
