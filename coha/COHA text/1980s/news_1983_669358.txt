But the Syrians are not the Americans . Those who rule in Damascus do not share the US liberal dogma that when guns are used it means diplomacy has failed . Military force is a traditional and much respected tool for settling disputes in the region . Those reluctant to employ power should stay away from the Middle East. // Nor can the President be fairly charged of recklessness in handling the Syrians . Once the Marines arrived in Lebanon they had to be protected against hostile attacks . There is little doubt that most of these attacks are , if not directly orchestrated by Damascus , at least organized with its knowledge , approval , and support . A great power like the United States can not afford to give the impression that a small but assertive Soviet ally can push it around with impunity. // Similarly , I would not blame Mr. Reagan for putting too much emphasis on the East-West dimension of the Lebanese situation . The administration , on the whole , recognizes that deep divisions between Lebanese factions are not Moscow ' s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the State Department realize that Syria has its own agenda and is not a Soviet puppet. // Syrian leadership in Damascus consists of tough and pragmatic men . They would probably never dare to challenge the US and Israel if they did not feel that the Soviet superpower was behind them . At this point - regardless of historical rights and wrongs - success for Damascus means a gain for the Kremlin and a loss for the US. // But while a lot of liberal criticism of the administration ' s performance in Lebanon is off the mark , there are indeed good reasons to worry . The President does not seem to know exactly what America is doing in Lebanon or what the consequences of US actions are . This kind of analytical blindness is frightening considering that the lives of American marines are on the line , that US credibility as a superpower is at stake , and that the risk of a direct military clash with the Soviet Union is growing every day. // Mr. Reagan declared that the US does not want a military confrontation with Syria @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surveillance planes represented an unprovoked attack . If the President made this statement exclusively for public relations purposes it would still be appropriate to ask whom he thinks he is kidding . But White House aides insist that Mr. Reagan was truly appalled by the Syrian action . If that is so , we are really in trouble. // Just look at the facts . Here the administration is proceeding with practical steps to develop strategic cooperation with Israel . Against whom ? President Assad does not have to be paranoid to assume that he is the most immediate target . And there is indeed a lot of talk among senior officials in Washington about using the Israelis to cut Syria down to size. // Just a few days after Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir and Defense Minister Moshe Arens returned home from the US , the Israeli Air Force proceeded with bombing raids against positions of Palestinian and Lebanese radical factions , positions located well behind Syrian lines . The same day US reconnaissance planes flew over sensitive areas . Are the Syrians obliged to know that this was not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to believe that information about Syrian positions collected by the planes would not be passed to the Israelis ? And remember all this is happening literally at Syria ' s doorstep , just about 30 miles away from Damascus. // Surely , President Assad and his colleagues feel threatened and provoked . A case can be made that such a feeling in Damascus may be entirely constructive . Intimidating the opponent is a perfectly acceptable technique when the forces of the two sides are eyeball-to-eyeball . But then the administration has to explain the purpose of the intimidation . There should be a connection between the magnitude of the threat made to an adversary and the concessions you want him to make. // What is Reagan ' s threat to Assad ? More military pressure in Lebanon ? But that only makes the Syrian leader a hero in the eyes of other Arab nations and his own people . Any military equipment Assad loses is going to be quickly replaced by the Soviet Union . And the prospect of suffering casualties among Syrian soldiers never seemed to deter those who ruled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reagan administration nor the Israelis are prepared to launch a major war against Syria . If that is the case , there is no alternative to making a serious effort to reach an agreement with Syria . A deal does not preclude attempting to squeeze Damascus as hard as possible . But it also requires realism and flexibility . And all the Reagan administration is willing to offer to Syria is essentially - if rhetoric about respecting legitimate Syrian interests is discounted - to get out of Lebanon on terms developed jointly by Israel and the US . To expect Assad to oblige is daydreaming. // Unfortunately , this would not be the first time that the White House has appeared to be living in a world of fiction . Mr. Reagan fails to see why calling Soviet leaders liars and cheaters and promising to put their regime on the ' ' ash heap of history ' ' should complicate arms control negotiations with Moscow . He does not see why most states in the world see US action in Grenada as an invasion rather than a rescue mission. // Up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ineptness has saved the US from foreign policy disasters . Relying on luck is no substitute for a foreign policy . If there is a banana peel in Mr. Reagan ' s political future he may well find it in Lebanon . The trouble is that if he slips in that war-ridden land , chances are that US standing in the Middle East and elsewhere may go down with him. // //
