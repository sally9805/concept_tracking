Former Rep. Richard Kelly ( R-Fla. ) , convicted in 1981 in the FBI ' s Abscam undercover operation , lost a Supreme Court appeal today and now could be sentenced to up to 15 years in prison . The court , without comment , turned down a plea for a hearing by Kelly , who claims he is the victim of a crime manufactured by the government . Kelly was one of seven members of Congress convicted on Abscam charges . He was defeated in a 1980 re-election bid . Kelly was convicted by a jury that viewed a videotape of him stuffing his pockets with $100 bills given to him by an FBI agent posing as an aide to a non-existent Arab sheik . In other cases today , the court : - Refused to review former State Department official Alger Hiss ' s 1950 perjury conviction for telling a grand jury he was not a Soviet spy . - Rejected , by a 5-4 vote , a plea on behalf of 30,000 disabled Americans who are seeking an estimated $19.5 million a month in additional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ billion judgment against AT &T,; the largest antitrust award in American history , for allegedly trying to monopolize the long-distance telephone market . - Agreed to consider reinstating a law that Monsanto Corp . said allowed the government to disclose trade secrets about new insecticides . Kelly has yet to be sentenced because his conviction was thrown out last year by US District Judge William B. Bryant in Washington . Bryant said the FBI had created the crime and had violated the former congressman ' s rights . However , the conviction was reinstated last May by the US Circuit Court of Appeals here . The appeals court said Abscam was " indeed an elaborate hoax " but one that legitimately ferreted out corrupt public officials . In asking the Supreme Court to review the case , Kelly ' s lawyers said the appeals court had sanctioned " the manufacture of crime " by law enforcement agencies . His appeal said , " The precedent established by the decision of the court of appeals provides that if the police can argue that a particular class of crime is difficult to detect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to induce crime and then justify the conduct by the crime they create . " The Justice Department , with unusual brevity , submitted a two- page document urging the high court to reject Kelly ' s appeal . Kelly , who was convicted of taking $25,000 in bribes to help " Arab sheiks " with immigration problems , said he took the cash in order to conduct his own investigation of " shady characters . " The justices , acting without comment , last May rejected appeals by four other former congressmen convicted on Abscam charges . They are Raymond Lederer and Michael Myers of Pennsylvania , John Murphy of New York and Frank Thompson of New Jersey , all Democrats . They began serving prison terms after losing their appeals to the high court . Thompson ' s prison term is provisional , depending on the outcome of medical tests to determine whether his heart ailment is serious enough to require exemption from prison life . Appeals by two other former members of Congress , John Jenrette , a Democratic representative from South Carolina , and Harrison Williams , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the courts . Jenrette , convicted three years ago , has yet to be sentenced .
