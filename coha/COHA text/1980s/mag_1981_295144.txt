The powerhouse of Europe suddenly faces doubts and challenges In the prosperous seaport of Hamburg , some 60,000 young demonstrators , many with their faces painted a ghostly white , marched through the broad streets ten to 15 abreast . They carried signs reading ROCKETS OUT and PEACE WITHOUT WEAPONS . In the same city , just 24 hours earlier , West German Defense Minister Hans Apel was jeered into silence by a congress of devout Lutheran evangelicals , as he tried to explain his government 's nuclear defense stand . <P> In Bonn , during one of the most high-strung sessions of the Bundestag since the 1950s , a young Social Democratic deputy stood before his vociferous parliamentary colleagues with tears streaming down his face . Why , he asked , was his party approving a $16.2 billion defense budget when millions of children around the world were starving to death every year ? His emotive question was answered with shaken fists and shouted injunctions to sit down . <P> That painful legislative scene was more than matched by the violence that erupted last week in front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of youths , some armed with rocks and Molotov cocktails , clashed fiercely with police in a ten-hour riot that one West German television reporter luridly described as " resembling civil war . " At least 76 policemen were injured . The ugly confrontation resulted from the eviction of housing squatters from several abandoned West Berlin buildings . <P> Perhaps the most startling scene of all occurred in Bonn , where some 200 members of the country 's armed forces , the Bundeswehr , paraded through the streets to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the organization . Fully 6,000 police were on hand to protect the soldiers from civilian abuse . Similar public military displays are now being largely abandoned . <P> Little more than a year ago , West Germany was the confident powerhouse of Europe . Powerful it still is , and undoubtedly it will remain so , but the populous ( 61.3 million ) , rich ( 1980 per capita income : $12,400 ) and gifted nation that has so often been a victim of its own excesses is now gripped by a uniquely Teutonic mood of Angst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far removed from a crisis of confidence , " in the words of Karl Otto Pohl , president of West Germany 's central bank . And nowhere are the effects of that mood more evident than in the concerned features of Chancellor Helmut Schmidt . <P> Only nine months after his triumphant reelection , West Germany 's usually ebullient leader has watched his authority begin to be openly challenged . His German Social Democratic Party ( S.P.D. ) was ousted from city hall in West Berlin in May . An amorphous left-wing coalition , including important members of his own party , is impugning some of Schmidt 's most firmly held policies . Chief among them : Bonn 's commitment to the 1979 NATO decision to deploy U.S. missiles to strengthen Europe 's military security while at the same time seeking arms limitation through negotiations with Moscow .
