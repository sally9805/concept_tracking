Saturday ' s Preakness is shaping up as a slimmed-down Kentucky Derby after a two-week crash diet that has eliminated thousands of pounds of horseflesh . Five of the seven horses expected to compete at Pimlico in the second leg of U.S. thoroughbred racing ' s Triple Crown were among the 16 horses who ran in the May 3 Kentucky Derby . Those five are Ferdinand , who won the Derby as a 17-to-1 shot ; Broad Brush , who came in third ; Badger Land , who finished fifth as the 2. 60-to-1 second choice in the betting ; Snow Chief , who was 11th after going out as the 2. 10-to-1 favorite ; and Groovy , who was last after setting a record pace for 6 furlongs . Some jockey changes have been made . Chris McCarron , who rode the English invader Bold Arrangement to a second-place finish in the Derby , has replaced Vince Bracciale aboard Broad Brush . Craig Perret is back aboard Groovy after losing the mount to Hall of Famer Laffit Pincay in the Derby . And this time around , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year with Tank ' s Prospect and in 1980 with Codex , will give Badger Land a running mate . The newcomer is Clear Choice , who won the Withers at Aqueduct earlier this month . The other new kid on the Triple Crown block is Miracle Wood . Like Broad Brush , Miracle Wood calls Pimlico home . Maryland racing isn ' t as good as racing in California and New York , but four hometown boys have made good in the 1 3/16-mile Preakness in the last 14 years : Bee Bee Bee in 1972 , Spectacular Bid in 1979 , Aloma ' s Ruler in 1982 and Deputed Testamony in 1983 . Although Miracle Wood will go off as a longshot , Ferris Allen , who trains the gelding for his father , Albert F. Allen Jr. , likes his chances . " My horse has proven he can handle the racetrack . As a 2-year-old , he won five straight at Pimlico , " said the trainer . " Now , he has got to prove he can handle the class of horse he will meet in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is a great crop of 3-year-olds . Most of the best horses are on the sidelines , and the ones here look beatable . " It is very easy to make a case for Broad Brush winning the Preakness . Yet Miracle Wood lost to him by only two lengths in the Jim Beam ( at Latonia in March ) despite having all kinds of trouble . " If you look at his form , this race seems to be within his ability . " Perusal of Miracle Wood ' s past performance sheet reveals he has won 5 of his 19 races and has been in the money 15 times . A sixth triumph ( one of the races last year at Pimlico ) officially became a second-place finish because of a foul claim . " A burst of speed that enables Miracle Wood to make up a lot of ground is one of his biggest assets , " said Allen . " As long as he has something to run at , he will run . His problem is that he pulls up when he gets in front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was third in the Cherry Hill Mile and the Garden State Stakes . He beat himself . In the Cherry Hill , he made the kind of move that Ferdinand did in the Kentucky Derby . But then he loafed and got beat . " Until he won the Kentucky Derby , loafing after seizing the lead also was Ferdinand ' s big hang-up . But while Ferdinand is a blue-blooded son of 1970 English Triple Crown winner Nijinsky II , Miracle Wood is as common as they come in terms of pedigree . Albert Allen brought his mother , Age of Miracles , for $1 , 000 and bred her to the sire Baederwood for another $1 , 000 . When Miracle Wood was a youngster , he had a mean streak , so he was gelded . But his disposition remains nasty . " He ' s a hard horse to handle , but ( jockey ) Don Miller knows this horse better than anybody , so why should I get a big-name rider ? " said Ferris Allen . Miller was aboard Deputed Testamony when he won @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Preakness for Don to be able to let our horse drop back , " added Allen . " You ' ll note that in the races in which Groovy runs , the final fractions always are slow . He wears out the opposition . " The Preakness is set up for a horse who will come from off the pace . The race is set up for Ferdinand , Badger Land and my horse . I think Miracle Wood will be making one big run at them at the end . He has a shot. "
