In a statement inserted in the Congressional Record , the North Carolina Republican said the gunman , Ali Atwa , was flown to Iran on May 5 and reportedly spent three weeks in training camps near Meshed and Teheran. // On the day of the hijacking , at Athens airport , Mr. Atwa was a stand-by passenger and was unable to board the airliner . He was arrested by the Greek authorities after his two colleagues had hijacked the plane , but was later flown to Algiers to join the hijackers in exchange for some of the passengers aboard the T.W.A. plane. // // Two Training Camps Described // Senator Helms said that according to information gathered by his own staff , one Iranian camp where Mr. Atwa was trained had Boeing 727 and 707 airliners parked on a runway to familiarize hijacker-trainees with cabin layout and controls . The other camp was what Senator Helms described as " a special training center for suicide squads. " // According to his account , Mr. Atwa was aboard an Iranian C-130 Hercules plane that took officials of the Revolutionary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 9. // " By June 10 , it is believed that the Iranian officials were in Baalbek ( Lebanon ) working on the actual logistics and operations of the hijacking operation , " Senator Helms said . Four days later the hijacking occurred. // Senator Helms also said the Iranian Parliament appropriated about $65 million for an Iranian foundation that is believed to finance Shiite extremists in Lebanon. // According to the Senator ' s account , Iran developed the hijacking operation through a group known as Hezbollah , or Party of God . Publicly , Iran has denied any role in the hijacking while supporting the hijackers ' demands. // Reagan Administration officials said elements involved in the hijacking had close connections with Iran but they could neither confirm nor rebut the Senator Helms ' s account. // One element on which both Senator Helms and Administration officials agree is that Ali Atwa ' s brother , Abdullah , was killed last March during an Israeli military operation near Sidon . Senator Helms suggested that this was the main motivation for recruiting Ali Atwa for the hijacking . <> <> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who is a ranking member of the Foreign Relations Committee , said his information was based on his staff ' s monitoring of developments in Iran , Lebanon and Syria in recent months , especially in the last eight weeks . Aides said they had Iranian , Lebanese and other Moslem sources in the United States and overseas with whom they maintained contact. // Based on this information , Senator Helms set out a detailed description of what he said was the " infrastructure of terrorism " established by Iran ' s ruler , Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini , throughout the Middle East. // Concentrating specifically on the latest hijacking incident , Senator Helms , declared that the American people " have yet to learn of the deep involvement of the Khomeini regime in setting the hijacking in motion. " // He said that if the reports reaching his staff were accurate , Iran had designated June 14 , the day of the hijacking , as the " Day of Jerusalem , " to be marked by Shiite Moslems. // Senator Helms said there had been a transfer of $30 million from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hijacking. // The channel for the funds , he said , was the Iranian Martyrs Foundation , whose chairman , Hojatolislam Mahdi Karrubi , visited Lebanon twice , in early and in late May , for meetings with pro-Iranian Lebanese clerics in Beirut and Baalbek. // The Senator asserted that the Iranian Parliament had appropriated the equivalent of $65 million for the Martyrs Foundation and that Hojatolislam Karrubi had transferred " at least half of the money to the local radicals and leaving the other half with the Iranian Ambassador in Damascus . " <> <> Foundation Described by Iran // An Iranian broadcast , in reporting on a visit by Hojatolislam Karrubi to Lebanon , described the Martyrs Foundation as an agency for providing welfare and employment for the families of those who have died in the Shiite cause . American officials say they believe the families of Lebanese terrorists get funds from the foundation. // The Iranian radio has reported monthly flights from Lebanon to Iran of people financed by the Martyrs Foundation , one arriving May 5. // " Among this group was one Ali Atwa , whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who became one of the three original hijackers of T.W.A. 847 , " Senator Helms asserted . " In Iran , Atwa underwent a rigorous terrorist training course at a center near Meshed. " // That was the training center with the airliners , Senator Helms said. // " Later Atwa went to a special training center for suicide squads at Monzariyeh Park , close to Khomeini ' s residence in Teheran , " the Senator said . " It is reported he spent three days there. " // According to the account , the Iranian plane that delivered Mr. Atwa to Damascus also carried Mohammed Ali Avie , chief of staff of the Revolutionary Guards , and Moselem Reza Aghili , chief of the ideological or intelligence section of the Revolutionary Guards. // " The purpose of the Avie and Aghili visit was to handle the actual logistics and operations of the hijacking of T , W.A. 847 , " Senator Helms said . " By June 10 , the two were in the Baalbek region of Lebanon in order to assist in the overall operation. " // At about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sent to Damascus with Mohsen Rafiq-Dust , Minister of the Revolutionary Guards , to discuss the Lebanese situation , according to the Iranian radio. // Iran ' s explanation for Mr. Karrubi ' s travels was that he intended to condemn the attacks by the Amal Shiite militia , headed by Nabih Berri , on the Palestinian refugee neighborhoods in southern Beirut and to resolve differences between Lebanese Sunni and Shiite Moslems. //
