WANTED : Moderate Democrats ( blow-dried hair not essential ) to help move the party of F.D.R. toward the center in time for the ' 88 elections . Applicants do not necessarily have to come from the Sunbelt , but should appeal to Sunbelt voters . Blacks , Hispanics and women welcome , although ties to unions and other special-interest groups may be held against you . Old-line old-boy liberals need not apply . <P> A year after its founding , the new-look Democratic Leadership Council has found plenty of support for its call for a more conservative Democratic Party  --  without resorting to want ads . Organized by young , centrist Governors and Congressmen , many from the South and West , after Walter Mondale 's rout in the 1984 presidential election , the D.L.C. set out to do three things : shift the party away from standard-brand liberalism , stem defections to the G.O.P. , and create a climate for a moderate or conservative Democrat to succeed Ronald Reagan as President . What a difference a year makes . Notes Virginia ex- Governor Charles Robb , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What we 've done is evoke new interest in the party . We 're providing a showcase for a message and for messengers . " <P> Once sneeringly described as " the white-male caucus , " the D.L.C. has recruited a number of high-profile black and women members , such as House Budget Committee Chairman William Gray of Philadelphia and San Francisco Mayor Dianne Feinstein . Moreover , it has expanded its ranks from about 20 to 110 , of whom 79 are members of Congress . While the D.L.C. is not nudging any closer to the party 's Old Guard , the Old Guard seems to be edging closer to the D.L.C. The recent move by as many as a dozen Southern states to coordinate an influential regional presidential primary in March 1988 may push the two factions into a bona fide embrace . <P> To promote its views and showcase its members , the D.L.C. has conducted campaign-style road shows in five states , including California and Florida . On a recent trip to Dallas , Senator Sam Nunn of Georgia and Congressman Les Aspin of Wisconsin , leaders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 200 local Democratic spear carriers that while the Reagan Administration 's trillion-dollar military buildup had created a " museum of weapons systems , " the U.S. still lacks a sound and coherent defense strategy . Doves they are not , however . Said Nunn : " We need to make sure that the public understands that the Democratic Party stands for a strong position on national security . " <P> Initially , relations were not particularly fraternal between the D.L.C. and Paul Kirk , chairman of the Democratic National Committee . Kirk and other traditional Democrats viewed the D.L.C. as a kind of separatist movement of crypto-Republicans . Yet now Kirk seems almost brotherly toward the D.L.C. , talking about the " positive , constructive relationship " he has with its members . Kirk has acted on the D.L.C. 's diagnosis of some of the party 's problems : he has reduced the number of its special-interest caucuses and increased the proportion of elected Democrats who will be delegates at the 1988 convention . Kirk is also on the record as saying that the Democrats can not lasso the White House @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
