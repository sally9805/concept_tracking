txt named Arthur Frommer , who had been turned on to travel while serving In the Korean War , decided to put some of his findings down on paper . The result was a book called " Europe on $5 a Day . " Today , nearly 50 books and 13.5 million readers later , the name Arthur Frommer is synonymous with budget travel , and his books , which are upeatea aria revises yearly , arc use a oy nuagetconscious Americans across the globe . In the following interview , the 51-year-old travel expert discusses his views of travel today . The 90-minute interview was conducted by New York Daily News travel writer Jane Abrams and travel editor Bert Shanas . The following is excerpted from their discussion ; Q  --  Arthur , f see your original $5 a day book now sells for $6.95 and it 's called " Europe on $15 a Day . " . In this age-of recession and inflation , is it still possible to get bargains in travel ? ? - A  --  It 's harder than ever , but it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other things suddenly get better . One of the great travel benefits the public has enjoyed in recent months , for example , is the major airline price war taking place because bu4ness is bad . At the moment it has never been cheaper to fly by air to all sorts of major destinations in the U.S. And I would n't be surprised if those ? bargains last for quite awhile . So there are a few bright spots in an otherwise gloomy picture .. Q  --  Is it still possible to do any place for $5 , a day ? A  --  Not on $5 , bid there are a lot of destinations where I would love to keep the title at $10 a day ? Portugal , Turkey , Egypt , certain sections in Mexico . If you simply walk a few miles away from the strip of high-rise hotels around the Bay of Acapulco and return to the old city where Acapulco began , you can go on some of the side streets and have a good three-course meal for $2.50 . And you can also find delightful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd pay at a commercial hotel . Q  --  What are some other places you 'd still consider a bargain ? A  --  Much of Canada , which has a price structure for meals and hotels considerably lower than we have , plus the 15 per cent advantage , on the American dollar ; . Yugoslavia ; Israel , where the exchange , rate - keeps pace with inflation ; up and doWn the entire coast of California , which has the budget motels ; Miami ; and much of South America such as Peru , Ecuador , and Bolivia . You can even get great buys in food and lodging on the left bank of Paris if you know where to go . Q  --  You seem to have left out the Orient . A  --  Well , there are good bargains in the Orient , such as the " businessman 's hotel " and the inns of Japan , but first you have to face the barrier of // ' very high transportation costs to gel ' there Q  --  Itott travel about ' 200,000 mites E year in search @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a certain key to saving motley on the road ? " A  --  Yes , .. the key to budget traveling anywhere in the world is to have ammo of adventure . Mid : adventure does n't mean risk ? it means Teasing over a certain psYchological fear that the hotel has to look like a normal , commercial place . There 's almost a theory of limited possibilities in choosing a room , and a deluxe hotel room in many cases scarcely differs from a budget hotel room . But there are simply people who are afraid to venture into hotels that do n't have large lobbies , that do n't have uniformed Wen-dents , that do n't have elevators . ? This fear not only costs people money , but it denies them a real adventure . In Italy , for instance , some of the most glamorous lodgings are located in old , historic buildings whose facades have n't been touched in hundreds of years . They are decaying on the outside and pock- , marked with shell holes . Yet once you : pass inside , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Most exciting lodging establishment ' available to you . The exciting way to travel is to stay in lodgings that partake of the area in which they are located , that are local and quaint . Q  --  What about shopping ? Are there any places left for real bargains ? A  --  It has sort of become a joke . There are some specific limited items that can be good values in certain places , such as Finland for furniture , but all the tax-free shopping centers in the world can be dumped into the sea as far as I 'm con-earned . They no longer offer any great value to people , and there is no one place to go for a vast array of items . Q  --  How do you travel ? ? A  --  Well , I travel in a much less planned manner than most people do . I ' keep my passport with me , and many times I have just gone out to the airport and have gone someplace without having packed a suitcase . When I get to the destination , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marvelous feeling of freedom . Those have been my best trips . Q  --  What are the biggest mistakes " normal " , vacation travelers make ? A  --  Disregard what I just said about my own travel habits . Today one of the big mistakes.is not enough planning ? to assume that you can find the bargains at the last minute . There are all sorts of areas in travel today where you can travel cheaply only by making your deciskins far in advance . Many of the car , rental bargains , for instance , must be booked in advance , and the average traveler tends to miss that in the fine print . Q  --  Other big mistakes people make ? A  --  People ruin their trips by packing too much , loading themselves down with unnecessary suitcases . It slows you up and it 's expensive . Also , people waste money on escorted tours when there is virtually no tourist attraction in the world today that ca n't be reached by public transportation . But the greatest mistake that American travelers make is in not realizing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go to a large hotel , for example , the management has the right to change the price ? and if the rooms are n't selling , chances are they 'd much rather lower the price than let the room go empty . Q  --  Do you advocate using travel agents , or do you think it 's better to do the planning on your own ? A  --  You use . travel agents if you want relatively standard accommodations and facilities , and that 's not the kind of travel I prefer . I find that the most exciting kind of travel Is travel that involves nonstandard facilities ' and methods of travel , and you ca n't get that from a travel agent . But if you 're the type who wants standard sccommodatiens and wants a travel agent to set it up , make sure you get a good one . Most of them are quite professional people who work very hard at increasing their education in travel , but there are also a lot of awful agents who Will steer you  --  wrong . And a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deals to standard-type places . But the best kind of travel , I feel , is " do-it-yourself travel . " Q. ? This question is for those people who ca n't travel often , but save up for that one big trip ? perhaps to , Europe . Do you advocate seeing five or six countries In a three-week period , or concengrating on one country that you really want to see well ? A  --  I 'd say do the five or six countries . There is no experience in the world like undertaking that whirlwind kaleidoscopic trip . It 's not something to be disparaged .. It 's the way I first saw Europe . The variety that Europe can provide the tray-. elcr in a small space of time in a small geographical context is unparalleled anyplace else in the world . The experience of spending a three-week trip going to Germany , France , England , Holland , etc. , is a fascinating one that gives you an impression of the tremendous variety of the Continent . For the first-time traveler it 's a survey course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a necessity . Q  --  Have you ever really been fleeced while traveling : I mean really been taken ? A  --  Oh yes , quite often ? when I 've wandered into a bar , in France , let 's say , , and ordered a drink without first asking its cost . Then I discovered ' it 's $7.60 a drink . Once my wife and I stayed at a place along the Riviera that we knew was expensive , and every afternoon after swimming they would come around with a tray of straWberry tarts . My wife kept warning me that it . was going to cost a fortune , and I kept answering , " How much could it cost ? " So every day we had it , and when the bill was handed to me at the end , I nearly had a heart attack . Each one was. $10 , and the tea was $7 . I 've been taken many times by violating one of my most important budget-travel rules : Look before you leap . Q  --  Have you ever said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? A  --  I 've done it on numerous occasions , and have been disappointed every time . Whenever I have succumbed to that temptation , I have been forcibly reminded that , in travel , youth and adventure , lack of pretension , and relaxation are what counts . I 've stayed at some of the finest hotels in the world , and it was a different type of experience , but not nearly as much fun es staying at some small hotel where you have breakfast with the family who owns the hotel . Q  --  Where would you Re to go that yen have n't ? A  --  China , but that 's in the works . Mkkim , and Australia , which I somehow missed . Q  --  Where do you see the new big resort areas of the future ? A  --  I think that South America is going to develop itself considerably for North American tourism , because it is now cheaper to go to South America than to en to Rumne .
