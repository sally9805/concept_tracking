Kate Perkins ( not her real name ) , who graduated from college in the early ' 70s , has lived with several roommates since she arrived in New York nearly four years ago. // " I do it for financial reasons now , although when I first came to New York , I definitely wanted a roommate while I got used to the city , " she says. " i would live by myself now , but I can ' t afford it. " // Andris Lapins , an environmental scientist in Vienna , Va. , shares a house with two other men . He does it partly to save money , but mostly because he enjoys the company. // " It ' s no fun to come home to an empty house , " he says. // Annette Lynn , who runs a roommate referral service in Miami , Fla. , lists some reasons why people chose to live with roommates . Part of it is economics . Two or more can live more cheaply than one. // " And in Miami as in other cities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and there are only a few rental places available  --  at high prices , " she says in a telephone interview. // " Then some people buy a home or condominium , but they can ' t afford the payments , so they take in roommates , " says Ms. Lynn , who has two renters in the home she recently bought. // To people like Mr. Lapins , the cameraderie of a shared household is important . To others , it is a good stepping stone from their family. // " A lot of people who are new to the city want to live with a roommate for a year , " adds Ms. Lynn . " They don ' t know the good and bad areas of town when they first arrive , and they feel more comfortable with another person. " // Some also like the security of having a roommate. // " The companionship is nice , " Kate Perkins says. " someone will always know when and if you come home. " // Roommates include a wide cross section of society . College students , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children are all among the ranks of roommates . For example , the bulk of Ms. Lynn ' s clients are between 20 and 45. // " When I first opened I thought I ' d have a lot of college students , but they would rather find roommates through bulletin boards at school , " she says . " Many of my clients are professional workers who are too embarrassed at 35 to admit they need a roommate. " // One social worker in Portland , ore. , lives in a house with three others while she goes to graduate school . She speaks enthusiastically about having roommates. // " Since I am gone all day , I like to talk to someone when I come home , " says the social worker . " And because I am in graduate school , the support I get is nice. " // She also appreciates the diversity of all her roommates. // " Otherwise it would be too monotonous , " she says. // But sometimes the differences can mead tradeoffs . While Kate Perkins gets along fine with her roommate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one-bedroom apartment. // " There is a lack of private space , " she says . " And decorating is hard . The apartment is not really an expression of you. " // And like the two bachelors in " The Odd Couple , " the proverbial slob and Mr. Neat- as-a-Pin , Miss Perkins finds that different definitions of cleanliness can be a sore spot. // " But sometimes we adapt and help each other out , like I suppose married partners do , " she says . " She is better at some things that I don ' t really care about. " // Fuzzy finances can lead to arguments . One Boston man , who genuinely likes his roommate , wishes he had spelled out money matters from the start . He often carries the payment for rent and groceries for several weeks before repayment. // Roommates can be found in haphazard ways . Some people run into nodding acquaintances from college and move in before really discussing arrangements. others meet people through work or friends. // Some roommates are found through newspaper ads , which can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mature , neat , responsible person . " Others are more specific , such as one requesting " nonsmoking professional female , 25  --  . " // One woman moved into her house after she answered an ad in a Boston newspaper . She had plenty of college friends in the area , but she wanted to meet new people . She ' s pleased with the result. // " It ' s nice , " says the woman . " We ' re all independent . If I want to talk with someone , there is always someone around , but if I don ' t feel like talking , I can go to my room and shut the door. " // Most major cities have roommate referral services . Some ask a minimum fee of $15 , then hand clients a list of potential roommates . Others , like Annette Lynn ' s " Roommate Referrals " in Miami , actually help match personalities. // " We ' re very selective , " says Ms. Lynn . " We verify employment , get three character references , and check @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // Clients then fill out a two-page application asking about everything from cleaning habits to hobbies and interests. customers are also asked to write a short paragraph on their ideal roommate. // Before paying for a referral service , check a consumer group to find out its history. // Ms. Lynn notes there has been an in creChicago woman , who says she would not live with a boyfriend , shares a large house in an urban neighborhood with two other women and one man . She cites safety as one reason she and her roommates decided to include a man . Ms. Lynn also shares her home with two men. // " I have to admit it looks good in the neighborhood if there is man walking in and out of a home , " she says , bemoaning the rising violence in Miami . Although her service does do some mixed matching , if some one calls her and asks specifically to room with a member of the opposite sex , she tells them that she doesn ' t do that kind of placement. // Everyone who has never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // One graduate student recommends a heart-to-heart talk on work and social habits before the lease is signed . She decided to share a home with a woman she had known in high school and college . They had been fairly good friends , but once they moved in together , things fell apart . While the graduate student was working and taking night classes , she had only a little time to do homework late at night. inevitably , her roommate would turn on the radio . And the times the graduate student did want to chat , her roommate was uncommunicative. // " She would come home , flop in front of the television , and say she was too tired to talk with me , " she recalls. // Andris Lapins finds that directness helps when problems arise . He didn ' t know either of his two roommates before he moved in with them , but he says they all get along just fine. // " If something is bothering us , we don ' t let it accumulate or snowball . We just say ' Hey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // //
