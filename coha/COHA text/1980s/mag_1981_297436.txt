Reagan decides to build the MX and B-1 but leaves a few doors open <P> The " window of vulnerability " is one of the more intriguing , and unsettling , concepts to occupy the restless minds of defense planners in years . It holds that the increasing size and accuracy of Soviet missiles will soon make the U.S. land-based nuclear force vulnerable to a first strike . Ronald Reagan last week moved to close that window , slowly , but serious doubts remained about whether he had succeeded . <P> In a press briefing at the White House , Reagan announced that he had decided to go ahead with production of both the MX missile and the B-1 bomber . Those much disputed weapons systems would be part of a $180 billion modernization of America 's nuclear forces , a program that would upgrade all three legs of the nation 's strategic triad of air , sea- and land-based nuclear weapons . With Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger at his side , Reagan said he plans to deploy at least 100 MX missiles , which are capable of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a target . The first ones will be ready by 1986 . But the President scuttled the much criticized " shell game " plan , first proposed by former President Jimmy Carter . Under that scheme , also known as the " race track " or " drag strip " option , 200 MXs would be shuttled periodically among 4,600 shelters in Utah and Nevada to keep the Soviets guessing . Said Reagan : " No matter how many shelters we might build , the Soviets can build more missiles , more quickly and just as cheaply . " <P> Instead , the President proposed placing the first batch of 36 missiles , each carrying ten warheads , in rebuilt and " superhardened " Titan II missile sites in Arizona , Arkansas and Kansas . The President said he wanted to keep his options open on how to base the missiles permanently and pledged to make up his mind no later than by 1984 . Three possibilities for that are now being studied : <P> &gt; To load the missiles onto a new , as yet undesigned generation of large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which would carry the MX aloft on permanent patrol and launch it in midair . <P> &gt;To perfect an antiballistic missile that would protect silos containing the MX by knocking out incoming enemy warheads . <P> &gt; To place the MX in extra-deep silos sunk into mountainsides , thus allowing the missile to survive a nuclear attack . <P> Reagan also announced that he wants to build 100 new B-1 bombers , at a cost of $200 million apiece . The plane will be more sophisticated in both wing design and electronic equipment than the 1977 version scrapped by Carter . It is expected to start rolling off the assembly lines of Rockwell International by 1986 . Meanwhile , some of the nation 's 349 aging B-52s , whose ability to penetrate Soviet air defenses has been steadily eroding , will be modernized to serve as carriers for the cruise missile . Reagan also declared that research would continue on an entirely new bomber , the " Stealth , " whose design enables it to thwart enemy detection by means of its streamlined shape and radar-absorbent coating . The Stealth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the refurbished B-52s and the new B-1s are designed to fill the strategic void until the next decade . <P> Among Reagan 's other proposals :
