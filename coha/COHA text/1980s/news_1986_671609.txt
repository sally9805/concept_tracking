Under the new mechanism , Mr. Reagan may seek the higher spending by proposing matching spending cuts or revenue increases . His budget director , James C. Miller 3d , said Mr. Reagan would not propose to raise taxes but would instead offer some combination of spending cuts , user fees and sales of Federal assets. // Some Congressional leaders said , however , that Congress would not go along with the request unless some tax increases were included . <> <> White House Statement // The White House said today that Mr. Reagan found the budget resolution " generally acceptable " despite its deep cut in the President ' s proposal for the military budget . The budget resolution , which sets binding spending and revenue targets for Congressional committees to follow , takes effect immediately , without being presented to the President for his consideration. // Larry Speakes , the White House spokesman , said in a statement that Mr. Reagan was still unhappy that the budget " would alter the President ' s priorities " by cutting " too much from defense and international affairs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ billion reserve fund that would be activated if Congress approved the President ' s proposals for offsetting revenue rises or spending cuts , or if it passed its own version and the President approved . The President could then use $3 billion for the military and the rest for other unspecified " unmet critical needs . " <> <> No More for Pentagon // Mr. Miller acknowledged that the White House would not be able to get any more for the Pentagon this year than the total of the budget resolution plus the reserve fund . This means that at best the Pentagon would get little more than an increase for inflation in the fiscal year 1987. // Late Thursday the House approved the 1987 budget on a bipartisan vote of 333 to 43 . The Senate then passed the plan on a voice vote just minutes after midnight . Both chambers then left for a two-week Fourth of July recess. // The budget compromise , which was reached after weeks of deadlock and three days of secret negotiations , makes a cut of $28 billion in Mr. Reagan ' s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ billion . Many of the Administration ' s proposed reductions in domestic spending , including the ending of dozens of programs , are also rejected . But in the final compromise , the House and the Senate dropped $4. 8 billion of the revenue increases each had proposed. // The budget , with or without the reserve fund , projects a deficit of $142. 6 billion for the fiscal year that starts Oct. 1 . This is just below the $144 billion ceiling set in the new budget-balancing law , but the negotiators who put the compromise together acknowledged that that actual deficit might be higher and could thus set off automatic spending cuts. // The deficit could be higher because billions of dollars of proposed savings may not be achievable and because the slowdown in the economy this year and the drop in inflation is expected to reduce revenue projections and raise the deficit , according to the top Congressional budget negotiators , including the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee , Pete V. Domenici . <> <> No Assurances Given // Asked if he could give assurances that this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mr. Domenici said : " The answer is very simple . In a word , no. " // The statement of support from the White House was something of a turnabout because the Administration had opposed both budgets approved initially in the House and the Senate , especially because of the cut in Mr. Reagan ' s request for the military . In addition , just last week Administration officials rejected the idea of tying military spending increases to revenue increases. // W. Dennis Thomas , an assistant to the President involved in legislative matters , said , " What we ' re saying is we ' re not going to hug it but blow it a kiss from a distance. " // Mr. Miller said Mr. Reagan had decided to keep the budget process moving forward in an effort to avoid automatic spending cuts and protect the Pentagon from even deeper reductions. // Under the new budget-balancing law , money is sequestered through an automatic procedure if the deficit exceeds the 1987 ceiling of $144 billion by $10 billion or more . The cuts would be in addition to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ budget resolution. // " By finding the budget resolution acceptable and in asking us to work with Congress , I think the President is thinking we do reduce the possibility of a sequester , " Mr. Miller said . <> <> A Novel Mechanism // The $4. 8 billion reserve fund in the budget resolution is unusual in that it requires offsetting savings , either in spending reductions or revenue increases . In the 1984 budget the House and the Senate included a $8. 5 billion reserve fund for 10 social programs , but that fund required only that Congress and the White House separately agree to individual authorization of the programs in order to adjust the resolution to allow for the spending. // Mr. Domenici , a New Mexico Republican who supported Mr. Reagan ' s push for more military spending , ended up accepting the $28 billion reduction - $9 billion higher than the Senate initially approved - because Mr. Reagan had opposed revenue increases to pay for more spending. // He said Thursday night that he hoped the program reductions needed in the Pentagon to reach this lower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Reagan to accept tax increases to activate the reserve mechanism . " It is my hope that the dynamics of this will produce that result , " he said. // " I don ' t think it will be easy to get added spending for defense without revenues , " Mr. Domenici added , alluding to higher taxes . He has said Congress is unlikely to go along with the asset sales and added user fees mentioned by Mr. Miller. // Meanwhile , the House and the Senate sent to Mr. Reagan a $1. 7 billion supplemental appropriation for the current fiscal year , which ends Sept. 30 . Congress altered provisions to which Mr. Reagan had objected. // The bill includes money to resume payments to farmers through the Commodity Credit Corporation and to let the Federal Housing Administration resume guaranteeing home mortgages . Payments to farmers were suspended June 3 and mortgage guarantees stopped June 6. // In addition , the bill provides $150 million in aid to the Philippines , $50 million in aid for Ireland and Northern Ireland , $340 million to avoid layoffs at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ security and $13 million for increased security around the Capitol . <> <> EVOLUTION OF THE BUDGET // Budget figures for the fiscal year 1987 as proposed by President Reagan , originally approved by the Senate and House , and the House-Senate compromise . Figures are outlays , except when otherwise stated , and are in billions of dollars .
