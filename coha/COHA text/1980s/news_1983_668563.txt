" Christopher Columbus " wore red tights and an orange court jester ' s outfit . The outfit was too tight to zip , which only helped Columbus prove that in addition to the world being round , so was he . Columbus was Vinnie Massa , a Watertown roofer who for the last five years has played the role of the Genoese explorer in the Columbus Day Parade . Massa played Columbus again yesterday , in a costume so tight that it made his voice higher than usual as he shouted into a microphone from the back of a pickup truck . " Hey , let ' s hear it for America , " Massa shouted . " I founded this country for you guys . " At Berkeley street , Massa urged the spectators to sing " God Bless America . " Some tossed candy at him . Others shouted , " Leif Erickson , Leif Erickson , Leif Erickson . " Massa turned a deaf ear to the fans of Erickson , the Viking explorer who some historians claim got to America first . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Massa said . The parade route went from the Back Bay to the North End , winding past Boston Common , City Hall and Dock Square . The weather was mild and sunny enough for many of the spectators , estimated at 100,000 to 150,000 by Boston Police , to enjoy picnics at grassy areas . Some of the people who waved at Massa along Commonwealth avenue , and later joined the parade , were candidates for mayor , the City Council and School Committee in Boston ' s preliminary election today . Parade officials said that the three-hour parade may have been the largest ever because of the participation of the candidates and their donations toward marching bands and color guards . Massa spotted mayoral candidate Melvin King and his supporters waiting their turn to join the parade . " I made this possible for you , Mel , " Massa yelled . " I founded this country . " " What about the people here before you ? " King shouted , smiling and waving . John Camplese , general chairman , said the parade budget totaled $12,000 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gelber and Eloise Linger contributed money , some of them sponsoring area marching bands , he said . The parade ' s mood was indelibly political . King and his supporters , bearing a banner saying Rainbow Coalition , ' received especially loud applause along the route . " I come out here every year and this is exceptional , " said Grover Boatwright of Boston . " Everybody got themselves together for the parade . It ' s going to be very close . I want to see who ' s going to help the city the most . " John Low , a native of Malaysia , now a Boston resident , said , " This should remind people of how America has changed , of how far it has come since Columbus first came . " Said Herbert Bureck of Chelsea , " Seeing this makes you feel like a good American . " Ron Anzalone , of Derry , N.H. , and Vicki Brooks , also of Derry , brought their children to watch the parade . " It should be celebrated , why not ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other direction these days . " The Bonne Bell 10-kilometer race for women preceded the parade on Commonwealth avenue and caused the parade to start five minutes behind schedule . Some runners were still on the course when the Amvets Post No. 13 Color Guard marched forward to start the parade . One such competitor was Pat Oulton of Maine , who ran into the 26th Infantry Division of the National Guard at Gloucester street . " I ' m too close ( to the finish* to stop , " said Oulton . " I didn ' t know the parade was here . I guess I ' ll just have to run around it . "
