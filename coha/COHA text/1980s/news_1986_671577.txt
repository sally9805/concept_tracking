In recent years , local , state and Federal investigators say , the school , through two senior officials , was also the center of a money-laundering scheme in which millions of dollars - some of it believed to be connected to organized crime - has flowed through the school ' s books. // In one 18-month period , the authorities say , $24 million was transferred in and out of the school ' s accounts . So far , 13 people have been found guilty of charges stemming from the continuing investigation. // Prosecutors say that the web of intrigue , most of which involved sales tax evasion by merchants in the Jewish community served by the yeshiva , was a product of diverse forces - from the desperation of two school officials who saw the 79-year-old institution teetering on the edge of bankruptcy in the late 1970 ' s , to the local merchants who saw an opportunity to help themselves and the yeshiva at the same time . <> <> School Officials Cooperate // For the rabbi and the bookkeeper who allowed and encouraged the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its existence - personal profit was apparently not a motive , according to prosecutors. // Neither took money for himself , offficials say . Nor did they have any knowledge that the money may have come from organized crime . And both have also been cooperating with investigators since the process was uncovered. // But the implications of the scheme , which investigators say also netted the yeshiva about $200 , 000 between 1981 and 1983 , continue to unfold and spread. // Currently , at least five local , state and Federal agencies , including the New York State Task Force on Organized Crime , the United States Customs Service , the United States Attorney ' s task force on organized crime , and the Manhattan Dis-trict Attorney ' s office , which began the investigation in 1983 , are combing through theyeshiva ' s books and those of the merchants whoparticipated . Yesterday , in State Supreme Court in Manhattan , six merchants who admitted that they used the yeshiva ' s accounts to hide money from tax collectors pleaded guilty to misdemeanor tax-evasion charges punishable by up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - Rabbi Yisreal Eidelman , an executive vice president , and Sendor Berkowits , the head bookkeeper - were given suspended sentences last fall after pleading guilty to misdemeanor banking law violations. // Another man , a bank official who was charged with falsifying business records for his alleged roll in assisting with the bank transactions of the scheme , was acquitted last year in a jury trial . <> <> ' School Has to Survive ' // A spokesman for the school , who said that neither Rabbi Eidelman nor Mr. Berkowits could comment because of the continuing investigations , defended the yeshiva and said that whatever was done by the men was done so that it would not die. // " The school has to survive , " said Joshua Schloam , a spokesman for the yeshiva . " We ' re a nonprofit organization . We live from hand to mouth . We live on donations . If you have no other way , that ' s what you do. " // Prosecutors and school officials say much of what happened at Mesivtha Tifereth is a result of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Side over the years . The active Jewish community that formerly surrounded the yeshiva and supported it with both contributions and enrollment , for example , is mostly gone. // So , too - at least on East Broadway between Allen and Pike Streets , where the austere five-story tan brick building sits - are most of the local shops and kosher stores that supplied that Jewish population. // Today , this part of the Lower East Side has been absorbed by the expanding dynamism of Chinatown . Where there were once 700 to 800 students studying at the yeshiva , there are now only 300 . Where there were delis , now there are rice shops. // Indeed , prosecutors say that much of the support for the yeshiva , and the laundering scheme , came from merchants in the communities where the school ' s staff lived , rather than those on East Broadway. // Of the six who pleaded guilty yesterday , for example , only one was from Manhattan . Three were from Brooklyn , and two were from Monroe , N.Y. , which has a large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merchants on Canal Street , who had been implicated in an investigation of credit card fraud , however , that initially led investigators from the Manhattan District Attorney ' s office to the yeshiva. // Prosecutors involved in the investigation say it is still unclear exactly how and when the operation began - the two school officials , for example , both of whom joined the yeshiva staff in the early 1980 ' s , found the scheme already in operation. // How it worked , however , is a bit clearer . According to Jessica DeGrazio , the first assistant cording to Jessica DeGrazio , the first assistant district attorney at the Manhattan District Attorney ' s office , merchants would deposit checks in the school ' s account , usually with a check written on the store ' s account. // After a few days of earning interest on the deposits , the yeshiva would then issue a check of its own back to the depositor , but written to the merchant himself . For the depositors it was a means of both avoiding taxes and helping the yeshiva @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earnings from the interest. // Gradually , as the merchants told other merchants and local business people , the operation spread to a wider circle of depositors. // According to Miss DeGrazia , about 50 merchants - most of them in Manhattan , but also some in Brooklyn - were participating in the laundering scheme by the time that investigators stumbled onto it in 1983 . During an 18-month period that investigators focused on , up to $24 million in small transactions flowed through the yeshiva ' s accounts. // During that period , she said , the school ' s only dealings were with the merchants . The purported participation of organized-crime and narcotics figures apparently occurred only on a secondary level , that is , through some of the merchants who dealt directly with the yeshiva. // Mr. Schloam , the spokesman for the school , also stressed that neither Rabbi Eidelman nor Mr. Berkowits knew at any time that organized-crime or narcotics money was involved. //
