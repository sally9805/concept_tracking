Andrew M. Greeley sat down at his word processor and stared at the blank screen . He was struggling . This was not something Greeley did often . The fiery , Chicago-born priest had n't become the most prolific writer this side of Isaac Asimov by staring at his screen . But this was different . This was n't some silly piece of journalism he could dash off for TV Guide , and it was n't one of his racy novels either . Those novels with their choppy sentence fragments and their steamy sex scenes . Those novels with titles like The Cardinal Sins and Ascent Into Hell that in the past few years had made Andrew M. Greeley both wealthy and notorious . No , this was serious business . Andrew M. Greeley was trying to save the Catholic Church . His Catholic Church . The Church he loved despite its many , many flaws . Flaws that he had been pointing out , in one forum or another , for years . He knew the bishops could care less about what he had to say . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hack . He knew Catholic intellectuals looked down their noses at him . But he was n't going to let that stop him . He never had before . Along with his co-author and sister Mary Greeley Durkin , he had already decided on the title for this new book . He would call it How to Save the Catholic Church . It there Was one thing Greeley had learned in his years as a writer , it was that subtlety got you nowhere . But he was having trouble getting started . His thoughts wandered . An image began forming in his mind . He saw a man and woman , and they were holding each other tightly , kissing passionately . Their hands were all over each other . Sex , he thought . That 's how he could save the Catholic Church . He knew the intelligentsia would scoff at him for putting a sex scene in this serious work . But it would catch their attention , would n't it ? Greeley had to chuckle at that . Quickly , he began writing : " Consider this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night , and a man and a woman , key members of the candidate 's campaign staff , are with a small group of loyal workers in a hotel suite watching the returns . . . As the candidate moves to make an appearance in the hotel ballroom , the slightly tipsy staff members begin a round of jubilant embraces . Our man and woman hug and kiss each other and suddenly something happens . Their bodies , alive with sensation , cling together . Their embraces and kisses are filled with a passion unlike the embracing of other jubilant staff members . When they finally separate , both are somewhat shaken . As they move to congratulate the others , they ache to return to each other . " Nice , Greeley thought . Maybe not as racy as " he parted her legs , and as gently as he could , invaded her , deflowered her , reveled in her flesh " those mem-orable lines from his best-seller , Ascent P.O. Box 66218 Los Angeles , CA 90066 into Hell . But this would do . He could run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nice things about being a novelist as Greeley knew , is that when a man ached for a woman who was not his wife , there was always a plot device to keep them out of sin . A plane crash with the man 's wife aboard , for instance . Not so in a serious tome about saving the Catholic Church . In a serious tome about saving the Catholic Church , he had to pop the big question : " What should the couple do ? " But now Greeley had another problem . He knew that such passion was , in its own way , a divine gift , and that Catholics , if properly taught by their priests ( which they never were , in Greeley 's opinion ) , should be able to appreciate that . That was the point of the scenario , and the point of his novels too . But without the convenient plane crashes , he did n't really have an answer to the question . So he dropped it . No one would notice , Greeley decided . B ESIDES , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Andrew M. Greeley always had many things to say about sex . He thought his Church needed to encourage good sex , partly because " the better Catholics are as lovers , the more fully they will experience God . " But Greeley also knew that sex could be a terrific promotional tool . Back in the days when he was a Catholic sociologist ? not quite as famous as he was today , but still pretty famous ? he had read studies on the subject , and even done a few himself . " In those marriages where the husband considers the sexual relationship satisfactory , he is more inclined to engage in religious practices , " Greeley now wrote . The Church hierarchy ? Greeley snorted at the thought of those buffoons ? why , they were so out of it they probably did n't even know such studies existed . Greeley wrote that down too . Greeley was just getting warmed up . He thought priests should be trained to become marriage counselors , that Holy Week should emphasize sex , that those buffoons in the hierarchy should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the significance of sexual intimacy " ? which they never would , in Greeley 's opinion . Finally , he wrote that further study was needed . The further study part was , Greeley knew , one of the things you were always supposed to do in a serious book . His sex chapters finished , Greeley 's mind started wandering again . He looked out his window . Just then a woman walked by . She was a little less than average height , with soft honey-blonde hair , a clear cream complexion , and a figure like a nineteenth-century odalisque . " A figure like a nineteenth-century odalisque , " chuckled Greeley . He should write that down . He could use that line in his next novel ? that is , if he had n't used it in his last one . He looked at the woman again , just as she was passing out of sight . Greeley 's body stirred . " Ah , God 's image , " he thought with a smile . ryl HEN it came to him . Women , he I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Church . He 's done the studies ? he knew the score . The Catholic Church had " a deeply ingrained , and largely ignored , bias against women . " It refused to perceive God as a woman , even though Greeley had figures showing that a high percentage of Catholics occasionally envisioned a female God . It refused to develop a two-career theology , even though its traditional stance ? woman as God 's housewife ? was woefully out of touch . It refused to consider women as priests even though Greeley 's research showed that " women were active followers of Jesus . " And naked women ? " Many Madison Avenue businessmen recognize the sacramental potential of the unclothed body more than Church leaders do , " Greeley wrote glibly . Let it never be said that Andrew M. Greeley backed away from sweeping generalities . Still , Greeley knew his stance put him largely in agreement with feminists ? even , yes , some of those otherwise contemptible radical feminists . Well , Greeley knew how to take care of that . " While Susan Brownmiller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he wrote , " South American revolutionary women celebrate the disappearance of advertisements that use a woman 's body as a sign that the revolution has been successful . " Not that this digression had anything in the world to do with saving the Catholic Church , but Greeley knew that a well-placed cheap shot was necessary now and again to prove his independence . And speaking of digressions , remember Jessica Lange playing the God figure in All That Jazz ? Now there was a God with sex appeal . And that reminded Greeley of the time when the cretins in the Church hierarchy condemned the movie The Red Danube because Janet Leigh wore tights ? though she wat " considerably more dressed than het daughter Jamie Lee Curtis in movie today . " Nice line , Greeley thought . He would have to find a place to put it in his hook . B Y NOW it was lunchtime . Greeley decided to take a walk . Though he was now a professor in Arizona , he still loved Chicago , and spent as much time there as possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the old neighborhoods and the old parishes with their flamboyant , alluring rituals . They were the ethnic neighborhoods , of course , but nobody called them that then . Not until Greeley and a few others like his old confrere Michael Novak came along to defend the ethnics from the sneers of the intellectuals . Now the neighborhoods and parishes were dying , and as for Novak ? it made Greeley 's blood boil to think about it . Novak was nothing but a turncoat liberal . Greeley would have to find a way to put that in his book . Suddenly he was a hit with a new burst of inspiration . Bring back the neighborhoods ! Bring back the parishes ! That 's how he would save the Catholic Church . He raced back to his word processor . He could envision the new parish in his mind 's eye ? and by God , it was a lot like the old ethnic parish , except there were Catholic yuppies instead of Catholic ethnics . It had basketball courts . It had political bosses . It had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was fashionable practice among post-Vatican II intellectual elites to dismiss the Catholic schools as inferior , " he wrote . But Greeley knew better . He had done a survey . And as long as he was rolling he had a few other ideas for saving the Catholic Church . He 'd hire " liturgical artists " to goose the liturgy ! He 'd get rid of those crappy folk songs that the liberal priests swooned over ! He 'd bring back the Blessed Virgin in a big way ! And saints ! Even the ones who turned out not to be real ! And angels ! And purgatory ! And art ! Remember when the church built wonderful things like Notre Dame and Chartres ? Now that was a church to he proud of . The church has to start commissioning great art again . And he 'd get rid of all that social justice nonsense . Only Greeley had the guts to describe the Catholic activists as they really were : " angry , screaming crazies . " " Pop Marxists . " Even in this serious book , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ novels ? If there was one sure way to save the Catholic Church , that was it . He would insist that every American Catholic buy his novels and read them . Of course , he could n't say it quite that bluntly in his serious book , but he could strongly imply it . It really fried him when he thought about what short shrift the reviewers and the elites gave his novels . Did n't these people understand anything ? Could n't they hear his message ? N0000 . " These stories , " Greeley wrote angrily , " were explicitly , formally , deliberately , blatantly theological . " Not only that , but everything Greeley was saying in his serious book he had already said in his novels . He 'd shown woman as God . He 'd proven that sex could be good for Catholics . He 'd pictured bishops as the cretins they were . He 'd had all kinds of metaphors for the sacraments . And for those idiot reviewers who did n't get metaphors , he had even spelled everything out in an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read his novels , he would n't have to say everything again in this book . The truth was ? and Greeley was n't ashamed to say it ? his novels and this new book were exactly the same book . W ITH a final burst at the word processor , Greeley was finished . He looked back over his proposals . He was pleased . In terms of the politics of the church , with which Greeley was acutely attuned , some of his ideas came from the left . Others , however , came from the right . He liked that . " Something . . . to offend all ideologues , " he wrote smugly . Professional iconoclasm . What a way to make a living . He knew what the reaction would he , though . Now Greeley was getting , mad again . The bishops ? Greeley knew the bishops would n't even read this book , much less take it seriously . If the bishops were ever persuaded by something Andrew Greeley said , he thought darkly , he would have to " check with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other leopards are changing their spots . " It made him so mad he decided to put that line in his book . And the elites and the critics whose thinking was permeated with " halfeducated pop Freudianism . and vulgar Marxism ? " Greeley knew all too well what they would say too . He had heard it all before , They would say that there were grains of truth in his writing ? they always threw him that sop ? particularly on the subjects of sex and women . The Church did have a problem dealing with sex . The Church did have a problem dealing with women . But then they would go on the offensive . They would accuse Greeley of avoiding the big policy questions on sex celibacy , and birth control , for starters . They would say his book was nothing but a hodgepodge of his own personal hobgoblins ? that it contained nothing he had n't said a dozen times before , that it was less an agenda for saving the Catholic Church than a chance for Greeley to carry the banner for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low thinking , of wild and absurd digressions , of glib writing , of generalizing to the point of losing credibility , and of hurting his own arguments with his inability to resist the cheap shot . Greeley knew all that . But all at once it did n't bother him anymore . His spirit lightened . He turned back to the word processor . Greeley had a terrific new idea for a novel . It was about a young American nun with this great bod who gives up her vows to become a Latin American revolutionary . Let the intellectuals sneer ! So what if the bishops ignored him ? Fr . Andrew M. Greeley would be laughing all the way to the bank .
