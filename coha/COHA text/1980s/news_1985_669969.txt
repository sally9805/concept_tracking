VIENNA , Austria  --  The double blow of falling oil production and prices is depriving new Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev of the hard currency earnings he needs to finance his ambitious economic plans . While Mr. Gorbachev was ousting rivals , campaigning against alcoholism and firing inefficient managers , oil output refused to follow his script . Production fell 4% , to 1. 8 billion barrels , in the first five months of this year from the year earlier , and depressed world prices have reduced the worth of each barrel . Moreover , the decline follows last year ' s output decrease of 0. 5% , the first such decline for the world ' s biggest oil producer since World War II , to 4. 47 billion barrels . " If Gorbachev can ' t halt that drop there is going to be a tight squeeze on him , " says Marshall Goldman , associate director of the Russian Research Center at Harvard University , who compiled the statistics . Indeed , Western experts say the ripples of the Soviet oil woes are already spreading . Oil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1983 , the last year for which statistics are available . A drop in oil income means Moscow has less capital to purchase the technology from Western Europe and Japan that is essential to Mr. Gorbachev ' s plans for modernizing existing industry . The Soviet leader also wants to buy more efficient energy recovery and conservation equipment . To ease the shock of the oil decline , Moscow has had to turn to its already hard-pressed socialist neighbors , who rely heavily on Soviet oil deliveries . The Kremlin is demanding that they provide more investment for energy recovery projects and , in exchange for Soviet oil , supply more goods they could sell for hard currency to the West . However , Mr. Goldman and others warn not to exaggerate the Soviets ' oil problems or assume the production decline will continue . He believes that because so much Soviet oil has been " squandered " for so long , Mr. Gorbachev has an opportunity , through disciplinary measures alone , to , at least for this year , stop the decline in production . He says May @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickly , the new Soviet leader is increasing discipline and cracking down on alcoholism , which is particularly high in the northern oil districts . To leave more crude available for export , he has introduced often Draconian conservation measures , and is increasingly substituting natural gas for oil domestically . The Soviets also last year imported 21. 9 million barrels of Middle Eastern oil , largely in exchange for arms deliveries , and the bulk of that oil was re-exported . Hence , despite a decrease in domestic production last year , the Russians managed to cope at home and actually export 36. 5 million barrels more oil in 1984 than the year before . " An energy shortage won ' t hit the Soviet Union because it has been able to make the switch from oil to natural gas with some degree of success , " says Jochen Bethkenhagen of the German Economic Institute in Berlin . He says the difficult winter this year , which disrupted Soviet oil exports for four months , made the situation more difficult but not critical . He estimates that oil production over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from 4. 47 billion barrels , and that exports will remain fairly stable . He also notes that if Western predictions are correct about a Soviet grain production increase to perhaps as much as 200 million tons from 170 million tons last year , Soviet hard-currency needs would be reduced , and the harm done by reduced oil income wouldn ' t be as great . Nevertheless , the backlash from Moscow ' s oil problems has been felt world-wide , especially as the Soviets are the world ' s leading oil producer . Their 12 million barrel-a-day output is six times that of Saudi Arabia , even though domestic demand leaves the Soviets with only about 6% of the world export share . Due to falling prices , the Soviets have been trying to increase exports to maintain earnings . To do this , they have actively wooed Western markets , often by undercutting prices set by members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries . In the third quarter of last year , Mr. Goldman says , " the Soviets supplanted Saudi Arabia as the largest supplier of oil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Soviets provided all of Western Europe with 15. 3% of its oil needs , compared with 9. 5% in 1981 . The harsh 1985 winter forced Moscow to disrupt and , in some cases , cut off deliveries to Western Europe . That sudden reduction of income , combined with a greater need for agricultural purchases from the U.S. , left the Soviets with less cash to purchase needed Western European and Japanese goods . This year , the Soviets aren ' t helped by an appreciation of the dollar , which gave them more money last year to buy West European goods . ( Oil is priced in dollars on world markets . ) " From the beginning of this year , they lost this compensation effect and falling prices are hurting them more , " says Mr. Bethkenhagen . " In the first quarter of 1985 , Soviet imports from Western Europe and Japan fell 10% from the 1983 quarter . If the Soviet oil industry continues to stumble , purchases would decline even more , perhaps spoiling Mr. Gorbachev ' s hopes of achieving an average increase of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next five years . The Soviets clearly understand the urgency , and many greater and lesser officials have been fired , including the Soviet oil minister , Nikolai Malsev . His successor , Vasily Dinkov , was a proven star as head of the gas ministry , which improved output by 10% last year and is likely to repeat that performance this year . Moreover , oil production at the largest fields in Western Siberia has peaked , so extra oil now comes from more difficult and costly drilling of smaller deposits . Most of these are in remote areas . The deposits are also deeper , often beyond the reach of existing Soviet technology . Geology minister Yevgeny Koslovsky announced that deep drilling would increase 40% in the country as a whole and 90% in Western Siberia alone . The Soviet press is full of stories of new drilling projects and new methods of finding oil . A recent report by the Soviet press agency Tass said scientists at Irkutsk State University have found a way to study hydrocarbons in snow to find oil deposits , and an institute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amount of fuel is recovered from deposits . The German institute ' s Mr. Bethkenhagen believes the Soviets won ' t increase output in their plan for 1986-1990 , but he says they will be able to maintain output of between 4. 01 billion and 4. 38 billion barrels annually at least through 1990 . Soviet experts insist that they won ' t face sharp output declines even after that . " The oil deposits of Western Siberia are a big cake from which we ' ve taken just a few spoonfuls of cream , " said Abel Aganbegyan , a prominent economist from the Siberian branch of the Academy of Sciences , in a recent radio interview . He added that some 30 oil and gas deposits have been discovered in the less-accessible and unexploited regions of Eastern Siberia .
