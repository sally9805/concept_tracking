The hunter : Detective William Majeski , 36 , of Manhattan 's Ninth Precinct . The hunted : Jack Henry Abbott , 37 , ex-con ( bank robbery and murder ) , protege of Norman Mailer , and overnight literary sensation with the publication of his prison memoirs , In the Belly of the Beast . They came into conflict , unseen opponents , shortly before dawn on July 18 . Answering a call for police help in the East Village , Majeski arrived to find the body of an aspiring actor named Richard Adan lying in the street . Adan , 22 , had been stabbed after an argument that began in the restaurant where he worked nights . <P> Majeski is a good cop , entirely dedicated to what he calls " the profession . " That night he believed the man who had murdered Adan had to be caught " before he killed anyone else . " The detective ran into a bit of luck when someone pointed out two stylish young women who had been sitting with Adan 's assailant . From them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the station , Majeski delved into Abbott 's background , trying to figure out where he would go next . Five hours after he fled the scene of the crime , Abbott brazenly kept a brunch date at the apartment of a writer friend . Majeski missed him there by a few hours , but he had picked up the scent . " The way the writer described Abbott coming in and chatting on about his plans for writing more books and taking a place in the literary world of New York told me two things I had n't known . Abbott was scared that he had already lost his literary place . And he was getting ready to run . It also told me that I was dealing with a cold , calculating guy . Then when I talked to <P> Norman Mailer , I got more insight , and Abbott began to take shape . Abbott had called him at 6 o'clock in the morning up in Provincetown , and Mailer was n't happy about being pulled out of bed that early . Abbott said he 'd call back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ response for rejection . He did n't tell him anything about being in trouble . From that , I was sure that Abbott was already beginning to think that he should turn to the people he had known in prison . They were his people , his society . " <P> Because the N.Y.P.D. does n't have the budget to send detectives around the country on a chase , Majeski had to track Abbott by telephone . He set up a command post in the basement of his Staten Island home . Using a nationwide network of law-enforcement contacts , he plotted Abbott 's moves on a map of the U.S. Majeski 's reading runs from works on psychology to Sherlock Holmes , and it served him well in his remote-control manhunt . So did In the Belly of the Beast . " All the clues to what he is , how he thinks , what he would do were in the book . "
