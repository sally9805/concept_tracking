 | Speculation about the Fifth Man began last spring . Who could he be ? Where was he ? Munich , New York , London ? maybe even Pittsburgh ? Finally , early this month , the Berlin Philharmonic , arguably the world 's greatest orchestra , put an end to the intrigue . There had been heavy betting that the Fifth Man would be James Levine , artistic director of the Metropolitan Opera in New York , or the Pittsburgh Symphony 's music director , Lorin Maazel . But the Berliners chose Claudio Abbado , 56 , the superb music director of the Vienna State Opera , to be their new principal conductor . Why the Fifth Man ? Because Abbado is only the fifth man to hold the prestigious Berlin podium in 107 years . The appointment of the Italian Abbado to succeed the brilliant Herbert von Karajan , who died last July , solves an immediate problem but not a more wide-reaching one . On the brink of the 21st century , symphony orchestras are at a turning point . When Karajan began his career @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Today , technology ? in the form of the jet plane , the LP , the CD and the TV ? has turned it into big business . As government subsidies dwindle and musicians ' salaries rise , orchestras play to the marketplace . They know that audiences generally attend those concerts , and buy those records , that feature the music and artists they already know and love . In the star system , everyone bids for the same few world-class maestros . Many conductors , including those in the second rank , overbook themselves , keeping up a frantic schedule of recording , guest conducting and sometimes taking on duties with another orchestra . Flying from Vienna to Tel Aviv to Chicago , they do n't have time to plunge into much more than the safest , most unadventurous repertoire . Composer-conductor Morton Gould , 75 , offers one solution : " Find a music director who gets airsick . " Roller coaster : So orchestras stagnate , and musicians grow disgruntled . But there are hopeful changes in the wind . Intrepid young conductors such as Britain 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ base is Los Angeles , and the American Leonard Slatkin of the St. Louis Symphony Orchestra are already providing blasts of fresh air . Bent on turning the business around , they 're experimenting in the concert hall ? and if audiences are will-@# ing to do a little musical homework , they just might pull it off . " We 're all groping around in uncharted wilderness , " says the ebullient Rattle , 34 , principal conductor of Britain 's City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra . " Maybe conductors and orchestras have to take themselves off the insane roller coaster of ambition , career , prestige and money and look to the underlying problems that face us . " While not abandoning guest-conducting , he and some of his colleagues are getting off the roller coaster , not to mention the plane , to devote most of their attention to one orchestra . By spending more time together , conductors and players are bound to improve their music making . Though some critics complain that James Levine hogs too many productions at the Met , at the expense of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of time he 's logged with the orchestra has paid off . Before Levine , listening to them was an exercise in excruciation ; now it 's a joy . " He has achieved this without firing anyone , which is really amazing , and he did it without raising his voice , " says principal cello Jascha Silberstein , a 23-year Met vet . But the biggest change brought by the new breed of maestros is the expansion of the repertoire into new music and into that which has been out of fashion . The Seattle Symphony 's Gerard Schwarz has helped dig American composers David Diamond and Howard Hanson out of semiobscurity. @#  | Since Slatkin became music director of the St. Louis Symphony in 1979 , he has turned the orchestra into a first-class instrument and has managed to promote its specialties on tour . " We could do the Brahms First in New York , but everyone plays it , " Slatkin says . " Slavic , American and English pieces are what people know us for and they expect that from us . So in New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ normal ' music have less . " St. Louis combats boredom ( its own and the audience 's ) by playing no piece more than once every three years . In many orchestras the repertoire is narrower in part because they feel squeezed at one end by the new-music advocates and at the other by early-music groups . But Rattle , for one , embraces the early-music movement . Last summer he conducted a wildly successful production at Glyndebourne of " The Marriage of Figaro " on original instruments . Contemporary music : For 20 years critics have predicted the imminent death of the orchestra unless it tackles contemporary music . Now conductors such as Rattle and Salonen are doing just that ? partly because they 're more comfortable with it . " The young crop believes that artists have a responsibility to music of their own time , " says Nicholas Snowman , administrator of arts at the South Bank in London . " It is much more difficult for me to find a valid interpretation of a classical work of Haydn , Mozart or Beethoven than it is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's work , " says Salonen . " The problem is the audience needs educating in order to enjoy fully the complexities of contemporary music . " That is a problem ; audiences clamor for museum pieces . Who could fail with an allBeethoven " threes " program : the third piano concerto , third symphony and third " Leonore " Overture ? Bruce Jefferson , promotions manager of Britain 's Royal Philharmonic Orchestra , admits , " We simply ca n't afford to take chances . In London you go for box-office appeal and restricted repertoire because that 's where the money is . " But audiences can be educated . " We 've got to convince them not to avoid something they do n't know . They may like it , " says William Littler , music critic of the Toronto Star . Ideally , young children would begin to hear new music in school . Imaginative programming ? as practiced by Rattle , Slatkin and Dennis Russell Davies in Bonn ? helps the acceptance of the unknown . The Los Angeles Philharmonic is embarking on a new project @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each season on one decade , from 1900 to 2000 , showing the wide stylistic range of each period . Many conductors are making headway by speaking informally to an audience before launching into a new piece ? a practice that Leonard Bernstein employed when Edgar Varese was still considered avant-garde . And while audiences need educating , more conductors need to be trained . But without ensembles of their own , they have no " instrument " on which to learn . . A young musician once asked Arthur Nikisch , Berlin 's second chief conductor , for lessons . " I 'd be very glad to teach you , " he said . " It 's really very simple . 1-2-3-4 , 1-2-3 , 1-2 . The rest is up to you . " The rest is tough to find : good orchestras now outnumber seasoned conductors . " As orchestras have gotten better , " Rattle points out , " they are less willing to put up with inexperienced conductors . That means less opportunities for a young conductor to learn and make mistakes . " In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but that provides employment for relatively few . With a shift in the balance of power between orchestra and maestro ( and a change in attitudes ) , the age of the autocratic conductor is just about over . In recent years musicians ' unions have stripped conductors of some of their muscle ( rumor has it that one American orchestra contract forbids a maestro from frowning at the players ) . The self-governing Berlin Philharmonic musicians handpicked Abbado but will almost certainly not offer him a lifetime post such as Karajan had . Shaping history : Leonard Bernstein 's symphony " The Age of Anxiety " could be the anthem for today 's orchestra . It is n't dead , but it needs to get new bearings . Ernest Fleischmann , executive director of the Los Angeles Philharmonic , thinks the shape of things to come may be a " community of musicians , " made up of some 140 players who group and regroup as quartets , chamber orchestras , new-music ensembles as well as a standard orchestra . This , says Fleischmann , would stimulate conductors and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rattles and Salonens , Davieses and Slatkins , may not know exactly where they , and their orchestras , are headed , but they 're exploring new trails . As Salonen points out , the conductor 's duty is to provoke . Ours is to be willing to listen .
