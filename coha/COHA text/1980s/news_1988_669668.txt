Behind those unimpressive titles , though , audiences are finding some very lively movies . They ' re very popular , too . In Hong Kong itself , audiences like them much more than big-budget imported films from Hollywood. // // They ' re also seen throughout Asia and in Chinese communities in Europe and North America . The only limitation on their visibility is in their own part of the world : If a Hong Kong movie is shown in mainland China , then it won ' t be distributed in Taiwan . So film companies must decide which of these markets is best for the movies they have to sell. // Once these films are distributed , all Chinese audiences can understand them , because - although they ' re spoken in the Cantonese dialect - they ' re subtitled in written Chinese , which is shared by speakers of all dialects . They ' re also subtitled in English , which extends their audience to another large part of the moviegoing world. // And the world has been taking notice of them .

Contributing more to their visibility , the Asia Society here is presenting the first major American festival composed entirely of Hong Kong films . It consists of eight movies and runs through Oct. 8 in New York , then travels to Miami for that city ' s first Asiafest , to be held Nov. 14-20. // Filmmakers trained elsewhere // Movies have been made in Hong Kong since the 1920s . What ' s behind the new interest in Hong Kong cinema is a new wave of moviemakers who have emerged in the past few years . Many of them have gotten their film training in the West - usually in the United States - and they often borrow their story ideas and techniques from American films . They ' ve been encouraged by an increase in movie financing by investors and by an upsurge in TV production that has helped many new directors get their start. // What ' s does a typical Hong Kong movie look and sound like ? It ' s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the people who make them . For the most part , though , you can expect an extraordinary amount of sheer action : chases , fights , and camera tricks that practically explode into the theater . Even the most dazzling or complicated shot is rarely held on the screen for more than a few seconds , because the filmmaker can ' t wait to jump ahead with the story and give more dazzling , complicated shots . The acting , dialogue , and music all jump to the same frantic pace. // The stories of Hong Kong films are usually less striking than their filmmaking techniques . Directors tend to choose screenplays that give the biggest opportunity for visual adventures - a practice that leads to many ghost stories , silly comedies , and action pictures about policemen or other heroes . There ' s little serious commentary about social or political matters , even though Hong Kong is on the verge of major social and political change as it ceases to be a British colony in 1997. // The reluctance of filmmakers to treat important public issues is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they say the wrong things . In one recent film , ' ' Gangs , ' ' the official censors reportedly called for more than 20 cuts , largely because of the inflammatory language used by gang members in the story. // Relevant message in ' Gangs ' // Still , some Hong Kong movies do make sly comments on important subjects . ' ' Peking Opera Blues , ' ' directed by Tsui Hark , is one example . Although it ' s an action-packed adventure about spies , villains , and disguises in the early years of republican China , it has revealing things to say about the problems of democracy and the traditional role of women in Chinese culture . ' ' Gangs , ' ' directed by Lawrence Ah Mon , also has a message that ' s relevant to Hong Kong ' s society today - and a realistic style that ' s very different from the wild fantasy of pictures like ' ' Mr. Vampire ' ' and ' ' A Chinese Ghost Story. ' ' // If experts aren ' t predicting that Hong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in world film , it ' s probably because most Hong Kong production is still geared to frivolous mass-audience entertainment . Some observers have lavishly praised aspects of certain pictures - such as the visual pyrotechnics of ' ' A Chinese Ghost Story , ' ' directed by Ching Siu-tung , and the sophisticated use of space in movies by Jackie Chan , who has been compared to Buster Keaton and similar masters of physical comedy . But others , including this critic , find even these superior works to be undermined by two things : a profound lack of serious undertones , and a frenetic need to keep tossing out razzle-dazzle effects when inspiration and ideas have long since run dry . Such films are charged with technical skill , but their virtuosity tends to be sadly empty. // There may be hope for Hong Kong ' s cinema future , though , since the tone of movie production there appears to be turning in a more serious direction. // True , audiences still love pictures like ' ' Project A - Part 2 , ' ' a kung fu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Asia and one of the world ' s leading experts on impossible-looking stunts , chases , and escapes . But a movie like ' ' Gangs , ' ' made earlier this year , indicates that Hong Kong filmgoers are ready for more serious looks at the nature of social conflict and violence. // Another movie with a different kind of perspective is ' ' Just Like Weather , ' ' directed by Allen Fong , a thoughtful and unusually structured drama about a young couple whose marriage is in trouble. // Dazzling , colorful adventures won ' t soon lose their popularity . But in serious movies like ' ' Gangs ' ' and ' ' Just Like Weather , ' ' the new wave of Hong Kong filmmaking may be reaching a new and exciting crest. // //
