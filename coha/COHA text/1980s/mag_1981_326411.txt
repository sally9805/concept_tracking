The rhythm quickens <P> By now the mournful drama had taken on all the predictable ritual of a Passion Play . First came the terse announcement that Raymond McCreesh , 24 , an inmate of the Maze Prison , had become the third Irish Republican Army hunger striker this month to take " his own life by refusing food and medical intervention , " as the British government officially put it . Then came the rioting through Catholic neighborhoods of Belfast and Londonderry as women banged dustbin lids in the early morning darkness and gangs of youthful I.R.A . sympathizers attacked army and police patrols with stones and fire bombs . At week 's end the grim cycle began all over again as Patrick O'Hara , 24 , became the fourth hunger striker to die . The rioting left one man and a twelve-year-old girl dead-apparently victims of plastic bullets-while six British soldiers were injured . But neither last week 's casualties , nor the possibility of more to come , seemed likely to force the British to yield to the protesters ' demand that they be treated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , British resolve seemed firmer than ever in the wake of a spectacular bombing earlier in the week that left five soldiers dead near McCreesh 's home village of Camlough in Armagh County . The 1,000-lb. device , planted by the I.R.A . in a culvert and detonated by remote control , pulverized a passing ten-ton Saracen armored car , scattering fragments and bodies around a 300-yd. radius . <P> Responding to the attack , Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher declared bitterly : " I hope that when the soldiers ' murderers have been tried and convicted , no one will claim that they are entitled to special privileges . . . for having done cold , callous , brutal murder . " Though opposition M.P.s have begun calling for a more flexible approach to the Northern Ireland problem , Thatcher 's tough stance on the prison protest still had strong backing from the British public : in a recent poll , only 4% believed that the prisoners should have political status . <P> A growing and ominous polarization in Northern Ireland was reflected in last week 's local elections . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seats with a show of Protestant militancy , making Paisley Ulster 's dominant politician , and candidates backing the I.R.A . hunger strikers fared well among Catholics . The results were no comfort for Thatcher or the Irish Republic 's Prime Minister Charles Haughey , who called a national election for June 11 , partly to win a fresh mandate for his attempts to mediate with London some solution to what he called the " tragic situation " across the northern border .
