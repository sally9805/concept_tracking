AUGUSTA , Ga . - Good morning ! Jack Nicklaus will stoke up for today ' s Masters with this hearty breakfast : orange juice , melon , cheese omelet , rye toast and Sanka . But when Barbara Nicklaus was asked if she ' d brought her favorite omelet pan here from Florida , she said , " No , it didn ' t make the traveling team . " . . . Her husband eyed the jammed press lounge after his 7- under-par 65 yesterday and grinned , " I don ' t understand why there are so many more people here than normal . " Answered a scribe , " We ' re just waiting for Greg Norman ( the Australian who was 6 under par at the time ) " . . . Nicklaus , at 41 years of age , and with a four-shot lead in his 23d Masters , still went to the practice tee last evening . " I want to fiddle with a few things . There were a couple of shots today I didn ' t like , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . " The man is tough , " said David Graham . " Norman and I played a practice round with him this week and Greg dropped his driver when Jack said this would be his 23d Masters . Do you realize I was two years old when you played your first ? ' " he said . . . It was a bad week for Lee Trevino , who missed the cut at 154 .

He was penalized 18 strokes , a shot a club per hole . " . . . Gay Brewer , who shot 68 yesterday , was brought up short when asked how many PGA Senior tourneys he would enter .

" Hinkle , who finished third behind Nicklaus last year in the US Open and the PGA , looked at Jack ' s 9- under-par total yesterday and said , " Hey , how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AZALEAS BLOSSOM : Tom Weiskopf received more media attention this week in his role as CBS-TV commentator than he ever did as a competitor . " For the first time in my 16 years on tour everyone in the gallery was pulling for me at Greensboro last week , which took some of the sting out of not making the Masters , " Weiskopf said . . . Keep an eye on Norman during the telecasts this weekend . This Aussie blond belter has charisma and is probably the longest hitter here . . . Hard to believe it was our charging Arnold Palmer who complained that he no longer is aggressive enough on the greens . . . Augusta National ' s press facility no longer can accommodate the coverage demand .

Completion will coincide with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involved in the project . . . Gene Sarazen doesn ' t live in the past . Before this Masters started Gene picked Jack Nicklaus as the " greatest golfer in my lifetime . " Watson could equal Jack , said Gene , " but I ' m inclined to think Tom may quit early .

However , the comparatively calm conditions for the first two days of the Masters have reduced the expected use of the new ball this week . . . Asked how the Chicago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Everyone knows I ' m a Cub fan , so I hope they win it . However , I ' m also a realist , so I know they won ' t . " . . .
