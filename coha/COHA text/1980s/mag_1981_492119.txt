June 1969 T he wedding invitations had been written painstakingly in calligraphy on fragile rice paper and were mailed in envelopes that did n't match . No one could find a source that could make envelopes to match the exotic paper . The scent of sandalwood emanated from the invitation ; the text was laden with ancient philosophical sayings from the East . After reading it several times  --  and by combining various clues in the text  --  the recipient could finally conclude that this was indeed an invitation to a wedding  --  a wedding to be held in a certain section of Central Park at sundown on a certain day . The rice paper was so thin , one felt it would easily disintegrate in one 's fingers . The bride and groom were assembled with their parents , attendants and a handful of friends on a knoll in the park . ( One can not call it a " grassy " knoll , for it was quite devoid of grass . ) Fortunately , it was a beautiful day . The couple had just spoken their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Haiku poetry , a few words from the Old Testament and readings of Buddhist philosophy . Somewhere in the maze of complicated recitations , the guests could make out the young voices saying " I Do " to the man dressed in white shrouds who was marrying them . The young couple was dressed in white , too  --  she in a long-sleeved leotard with a transparent overskirt that rather resembled bandage gauze . In her hands , as her bridal bouquet , she held a white flowering plant in a white pot . The groom was dressed in what looked like a man 's collarless shirt , elongated to the floor . It was custom-made for the occasion ; it was a sartorial decision that had taken weeks to reach . Both were barefooted . There was music from a lute , played by a young woman with hair that covered her knees . She was dressed in what looked like a burnt amber , unpressed cotton nightgown . Her music was accented by a bearded man who intermittently rang a cowbell . Both were barefooted . The bride had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individually  --  most want to wear , something that expresses the real you . " She ordered them to keep it as a surprise from her and from each other " until we all meet on the wedding day .. .. I want this wedding to be an expression of our friends , not just of ourselves . " One of the bridesmaids decided on her favorite jeans , which sported a backpatch that read , " Send the pigs to war , not us . " On the front of her white T-shirt she had embroidered two gold intertwined wedding bands for the occasion . Another bridal attendant wore a tattered , frilly Victorian teagown she had found in a thrift shop , which made her look as though she were the bride , come upon hard times . One wore a white college graduation robe ( which she explained to the bride was " in honor of your graduation into life " ) . The fourth wore a harem costume that made her look like the star of the " I Dream of Jeannie " TV series . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silly and absurd dream of a completely liberated woman . " The groom and his best man wore top hats they had found in a junk shop several months previously . The groom 's attendants all wore jeans with long , white Indian shirts . The bride 's mother was on valium that day ( prescribed by a sympathetic physician ) , and the bride 's father was on the bottle for the day , having been unsuccessful in his efforts to have the Central Park police stop the wedding before it could begin . Two older women who had been walking in the park stopped short at the scene and decided to stay when they concluded it was a wedding . One said to the other in a tone of obvious disapproval , " And to think on . Think how rich they are ! Wish we could get married like that . " She sighed with envy for something that could not be . May 1981 If you bothered to look at the embossed words on the unerneath flap , you knew the wedding invitations had been ordered from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on heavy ecru stock . A thin sheet of tissue protected the freshly inked engraving they call that , whatever they 're doing , getting married ! It 's a disgrace .. . . It 's a  --  a mockery ! " " Listen dear , " said the other in a resigned tone , " they 've probably been living together for a long time . Think of it as a blessing they 're finally getting married . They 're getting it legalized . " " Well , " sniffed her friend , " I 'm glad that with all that incense they 're burning , there 's a strong wind that will carry it all away . I do n't want Central Park smelling like that all weekend ! " After the ceremony , the entire group walked out of the park to a small restaurant on the West Side where they were to dine . The barefooted members of the wedding party stepped carefully among the pieces of broken glass and dog droppings . Once at the restaurant , the bride and groom drank from large loving cups @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drink the sweet liquid , following the Anglo-Saxon tradition that if the couple drinks honey every day for a month from their wedding day , their sex life will remain fantastic forever ( hence the word " honeymoon " ) . A trio of expressionless Indian musicians played seated in a corner of the restaurant while the bride 's father wondered out loud when it was " time for a cobra to come out of a basket somewhere ? " The bride 's mother shushed him . She was in a reverie , thinking of her own lavish society wedding in 1947 . She sat quietly , alternately holding hands with her husband for mutual support and nervously fingering the questionable contents of the dish in front of her . She managed a weak smile whenever she remembered that she should . The groom 's parents had skipped the reception , the mother having remarked to her husband at the conclusion of the ceremony in the park , " We 've seen and been through enough . " Late that evening , the bride and groom walked through a shower of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's parents ) , a psychedelically decorated Volkswagon . Two young strollers watched them leave . " Gee , " whispered the young girl , " that 's right from smudging in the mail . The invitations were expensive to mail because of the weight . They included the invitation to the church ceremony , another invitation card to the reception and an " At Home " card , communicating to the recipients the couple 's new address . As a reflection of the times in which we live , the " At Home " card did not say " Mr. and Mrs. John Smith . " It gave two names , his and her maiden name . It meant she was keeping her maiden name after marriage . In another break with tradition  --  but for the sake of efficiency  --  the couple 's new telephone number was given . Why not change the formal traditions to conform with today ? A pale gray canopy stretched from the church door , down over the steps to the curb . It had been put up by the florists only that morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ older women had been walking by , chatting busily , when the doors of the great stone edifice sud ?

He was the number-one driver , the one who drove the bride and her father to the church and who was now driving husband and wife to the reception . He began to reminisce how , in the garage before World War II , he always changed the tires on the limo from regular ones to white-walled ones if he was driving for a wedding . The door of the limo was closed , and the car pulled away from the curb . The two women strained to catch a glimpse of the couple in the back seat . All they could see were two heads very close together . The women and the other spectators , who had grown in number by now , turned their attention to the top of the church stairs where there was sudden activity and peals of laughter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the bride 's and groom 's parents and relatives . Eight beautiful young women pirouetted and flirted with the eight ushers in their cutaways . The bridesmaids wore gowns in shades of coral organza . Their nail polish and floral bouquets were a perfect blend . As they moved and their skirts swirled , one could see their matching satin pumps . Their capes were removable for dancing later . " The young people are so handsome  --  and distinguished looking , too , " remarked one woman to her friend . " Remember , Felicia , clothes do not make the man , " smiled the other woman . " But they help , Angela , they help . " denly flew open , and they could stand in the street and still have a perfect view of the interior filled with well-dressed people , a profusion of flowers and towering tapers that cast a lovely candlelit glow everywhere . The majestic sound of Mendelssohn 's " Wedding March " came pealing forth from the organ into the street . The bride and groom came grinning down the center @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ runner that had been laid only 15 minutes earlier by the ushers to protect the bride 's cathedral train . The couple was now on the steps , laughing and whispering to each other . " Was n't it great ? Were you nervous ? Did n't it look beautiful ? Did you see Uncle Harry in his waistcoat and spats ? " The groom was a handsome , slim figure in his dark-gray cutaway with gray-striped trousers and a tiny spray of white flowers from his bride 's bouquet tucked into his lapel . The wide skirt of the bride 's magnificent white organza dress billowed in the spring winds . Her maid of honor had draped her long train and veil over her arm , so she could walk without tripping . A series of well-polished black limousines was lined up in front , their drivers standing at the best kind of attention they could muster . The one with the widest grin smartly opened the door of his car for the bridal couple . He had put a sprig of lily of the valley in the The three-year-old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the older attendants . His job was done , he had produced  --  at the right time  --  the white satin pillow on which the bride 's wedding ring was safely sewn . The pillow was now in his mother 's hands , so he could join the flower girls in a game of tag  --  all over the church steps . He was a picture in constant motion in his white cotton-velvet shorts and white shirt with a lace Peter Pan collar . The flower girls ' long , coral organdy dresses had white-lace Peter Pan collars , too . All three young children wore black-patent Mary Jane shoes , and the little girls flung their flower baskets high and low with excitement . It did n't matter . The flowers inside were wired to the baskets and would n't fall out . The limousines filled and began to pull out from the curb , one by one , bound for the St. Regis Hotel , where guests could take the elevator to " The Roof " for the reception  --  just as New Yorkers have been doing since the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his orchestra playing an upbeat tempo in the ballroom , just as their parents and even grandparents had for decades . " Lester is a tradition , " the 27-year-old bride had explained to her attendants long before the wedding . " Mom and Dad had him ; we 're doing everything the way they did . " " No rock band ? " her friends asked incredulously . " No rock band , " the bride-to-be answered firmly and then laughed , " nor country music either . It does n't go with the kind of wedding we 're having . " The two women lingered in front of the church until it had emptied and the last guest had departed by taxi for the reception . " Is n't it wonderful , Angela ? Just like in our generation . " " Yes , " replied her friend . " Except for one thing , Felicia . When you and I were married in the ' 30s , from a sexual point of view , we went from our fathers ' homes to our husbands ' beds . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have probably been living together for years and years ! " The women walked away , happy but pensive and reflective on what they had just witnessed and what it all meant . What does all this mean ? It 's an interesting question . We seem to have survived almost 15 years of a youth revolution that began in the 1960s . During those years , the young instinctively rebelled against any tradition held dear by the older generation . The formal wedding was one of them . Parents finally gave in to their children 's " strange ideas " on how things should be run for their weddings . It was necessary to do so in order to keep those precious lines of communication open . Parents were at first angry , then sad and resigned as their influence waned and as the Haight-Ashbury hippie culture waxed . Parents looked the other way as their children took their wedding present  --  air fare and expenses  --  to go to an ashram in India or to a cave in Corfu to celebrate their marriage . It was either accept the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . For the majority of parents , it was far preferable not to be totally alienated . Weddings were not always the joyous affairs for the adults that they should have been , and the young people must have felt some sort of chagrin  --  even if they refused to show it . Today , future brides and grooms are going over their parents ' and grandparents ' wedding books saying , " Let 's do that , too .. .. That 's a nice thing to do , is n't it ? " Traditional weddings are being held in the church or in the temple again , instead of out in the field , in the forest , on the beach . The brides are wearing long white dresses with veils and sometimes even cathedral trains  --  even if they have been living with their grooms for some time . Couples are accepting the traditional wedding service instead of writing their own completely . They choose to have traditional music performed . Bach has won out over The Beatles , Simon and Garfunkel and folk singer Arlo Guthrie , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ folk guitar and the varied instruments of the East . They are relishing the unrivaled excitement of the bridal dinner held on the night before the wedding , hosted by the groom 's family . They and their peers take great delight in getting all dressed up for the occasion  --  the men in their own or in rented black-tie regalia , the women in honest-to-goodness evening gowns ( nary a granny gown nor a wrinkled peasant dress in sight ! ) . There are perhaps several reasons for this return to formality in some of the special occasions of one 's life . First of all , there has been the transition from the period of youth rebellion to a period of continuing quiescence . The Vietnam War is no longer inciting youthful feelings of frustration and nose-thumbing at anything America 's older generation felt or did . Today there is even a feeling of exuberance about ceremony . It 's rather an " **29;4271;TOOLONG " kind of enthusiasm . Young people seem to want a taste of that elusive glamour they 've heard so much about from the ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mature , they will probably add more and more formality to certain aspects of their lives . We ca n't predict , of course , the precise degree of formality . Debut parties are coming back in strength , but we ca n't be sure if there will ever be a return to women regularly wearing long , white kid gloves and ball gowns and men appearing in white tie and tails , wearing silk top hats . Right now , most of us are content with just the return of the formal wedding . It is a period of make-believe for the bride and groom . It makes the reality of what comes afterward more acceptable  --  the hard work that lies ahead in an increasingly competitive , strident , abrasive world far removed from the fantasy of the wedding ceremony . There 's even a fiscal reason behind the return to more formal weddings . The financial burden for the wedding used to lie squarely on the shoulders of the bride 's father , and if his income was limited , so was the wedding . Today , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But also , since many people are marrying in their late 20s and 30s and are making from fair to good salaries , they are paying for the kind of wedding they want themselves . This is a departure from past norms . It made sense for the formal wedding to come back to us again . The etiquette books tell us what to do , how to organize it . It 's a comfortable , secure feeling to know that one is " doing it right . " It 's better for everyone . It keeps us all from feeling clumsy and awkward when we know what to do , what is going to happen . When we do things according to custom , not according to someone 's whim of the moment , we do it more easily and therefore more happily . And those time-honored traditions can deepen the significance of the moment . " You know , " says today 's younger generation , " the old fogies had something after all . "              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
