Plots and tenderness <P> Just four months before an agent of Joseph Stalin 's secret police shattered his skull with an alpine axe in 1940 , Bolshevik Revolutionary Leader Leon Trotsky sold his confidential correspondence to Harvard for $10,000 . Last week the university 's Houghton Library unveiled it . Included were Trotsky 's own copies of 17,500 letters written by him and to him from 1927 to 1940 , and kept under wraps ever since at Trotsky 's own insistence , in order to protect his correspondents from Stalin 's possible retribution . <P> Trotsky 's letters disclose a new and fascinating personal dimension of the revolutionary genius who , as Lenin 's right-hand man , led the Bolshevik armed forces in the October 1917 revolution . After Lenin 's death in 1924 , Trotsky lost a struggle for power to Stalin ; this ended in Trotsky 's banishment and Stalin 's Great Purge of supposed " Trotskyites " in the late 1930s . The consequences of that savage quarrel run like a sanguinary thread throughout the Trotsky correspondence . <P> As the letters show , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stalin as Stalin was tireless in his efforts to kill Trotsky , his family and his followers . A large number of Trotsky 's letters are devoted to the organizing of his own revolutionary groups outside the U.S.S.R.-even as Stalin was organizing a special unit of his far-reaching secret police , the GPU , to hunt down Trotsky 's supporters , family and Trotsky himself . By 1938 his first wife and two sons had already been exterminated . <P> In one chilling letter sent to his second wife in 1937 , Trotsky described an early attempt to assassinate him . He wrote that the wife of a pro-Stalinist official named Vishniak , who " hated the official line and showed sympathy to me personally , " had warned him that Stalin wanted to finish him off " accidentally . " The accident actually took place on the anniversary of the October revolution in 1927 when shots aimed at Trotsky 's car missed their target and killed a militiaman . <P> In many respects , Trotsky underestimated Stalin , whom he dismissed as a " gray , colorless mediocrity .

Trotsky 's secretary in the years of exile , Frenchman Jean van Heijenoort , who catalogued the letters at Harvard , told TIME Correspondent Marlin Levin that only Hitler 's rise and the destruction of the German Communist Party in 1933 shattered Trotsky 's hopes . <P> Though Trotsky has usually been regarded as a steely , unsentimental figure , the many letters to his wife Natalya reveal that he also possessed a tender side . During a brief separation from her in 1933 , the 53-year-old Trotsky wrote : " What a torment it is for me not to have an old picture of yours , a picture of us together when we were young . Your image , dearest Natalya , as you were when you were young , flickers and vanishes . " The aging but indomitable revolutionary added : " Obviously all these years of persecution have had a great effect on my nervous system and my memory . It seems that my brain has become thrifty , economical ; it pushes out the past in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
