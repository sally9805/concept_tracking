AUGUSTA , Ga . - Just when stories had been filed to various time zones around the world about how two players from Australia and Spain upstaged the Americans in the opening round of the 44th Masters Golf Tournament yesterday , a self-taught player from the tiny Texas town of Llano came up the 18th fairway . Playing in the day ' s only threesome , which was tacked onto the end of the field , Jeff Mitchell proceded to birdie the 18th hole for a 3 , 3 , 3 windup that brought him in with a 6-under-par 66 and a tie with Seve Ballesteros of Spain and David Graham of Australia for the opening-round lead . When he did , it set him in motion for a round that included nine threes , one of only four birdies ( from 25 feet ) on the 18th and a confidence born out of advice passed on by his tour caddy from the Augusta National with the Masters-like name of Robert Jones . He answers to the nickname Cigarette and is the honorary caddy master at Augusta . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he started to tell me a lot about the golf course . I was hitting it real solid . I hit it in the place he told me you need to hit it . I wasn ' t sure what to expect when I came here . I ' d been playing real well . If I keep putting the way I putted today , I think my chances are good . " Mitchell , 25 , is a throwback to the time when kids taught themselves the game . His family moved from Houston to Llana , population 2600 , when he was 14 . His mother bought him a set of clubs for $10 , he went out on the local nine- hole course , went on to Texas Tech and now makes his home in Lubbock , Texas . Before he walked off the course , the spotlight had belonged to British Open champion Ballesteros from Santander , Spain , and PGA champion Graham from Sydney , Australia , who stepped out in front in opening bids to become the only foreign player except South African @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ win the Masters . Ballesteros , who turned 23 Wednesday , is the flamboyant Spainard who turned down a card to play the American tour when he won the Greater Greensboro Open two years ago . " I enjoy playing in Europe , " he said . " I feel a little lonely in the United States . Before you eat , you have to taste . If it ' s sweet , you eat . If not , you don ' t . " He also won the British Open last year at Royal Lytham and hit only 14 fairways in four rounds . He spent three months this winter working on a more controlled swing and he missed just one fairway yesterday . " I lost about 15 yards , " he said after the round of seven birdies and a single bogey , which came on the par-3 4th . Graham , who almost let the PGA slip away when he double-bogeyed the final hole at Oakland Hills last summer and had to go three holes to beat Ben Crenshaw in a subsequent playoff , played the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( the 12th ) in blustery conditions and hit his only bad drive into trees on the 18th . He had an opening and reached the green with a 7-iron . " I think I ' m a different person on a golf course since I won the PGA , " said Graham , who is , in contrast to Ballesteros , a permanent alien resident of the US . " I ' ve been to eight Masters and I ' ve always acome here thinking I wanted to play well enough to get back next year . So I was more conservative . The PGA win gives me an exemption for five years . It ' s something that changes your mental outlook . " Newton , who won the Australian Open in November , had six birdies , an eagle on the 13th ( 3-wood , 15 feet ) and bogeyed the 14th and 18th . " I ' m a little disappointed , " he said . " As well as I played , I felt I let it slip away . I played well enough to shoot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good score , but . . . "
