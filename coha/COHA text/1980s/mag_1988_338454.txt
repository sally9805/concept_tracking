As the leader of the only opposition party tolerated in Iran , former Prime Minister Mehdi Bazargan is one of a handful of political figures allowed to voice mild criticism in public of Ayatullah Ruhollah Khomeini . Bazargan has usually exercised the privilege with restraint . But last week Iranian exiles in Paris distributed copies of an open letter to Khomeini , said to have been written by Bazargan , in which the Ayatullah was accused of having created a " despotism worthy of the pharaohs . " <P> The letter charged that Khomeini stooped to " collaboration " with Israel in order to secure U.S. weapons , sponsored terrorists who have " filled the entire world with hatred against our country " and led Iran to the " verge of bankruptcy . " In the unkindest cut , the missive laid the blame for recent setbacks in the eight-year-old war with Iraq at Khomeini 's feet and begged him to " stop trafficking in the blood of our martyrs .
