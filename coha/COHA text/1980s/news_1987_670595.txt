His joy did not last long . Today , program trading is being blamed for contributing to the stock market ' s plunge . And the Merc may be fighting for its life . The Merc ' s Standard &; Poor ' s 500-stock index futures market has been the scene of tumultuous trading in the past week . But that may be just a hint of the difficulties Mr. Melamed and the Merc will face as Congress looks into the collapse. // Yesterday , Mr. Melamed discussed the market turmoil and the role of stock index futures : // // // Q. Did you see the wave of selling coming early last Monday ? // A. I will tell you that , prior to the opening of the market , Mr. Phelan ( John J. Phelan Jr. , chairman of the New York Stock Exchange ) and I had a conversation where he advised me that there were an inordinate number - " unbelievable " I think was his word - of sell orders coming into their market . That was like an hour before their opening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who knowns who pushed the button to make it happen . I think that button was pushed by a million times by a million people. <> <> // Q. How badly were your floor traders hurt ? // A. The S. &; P. 500 pit , by comparison with others , did well . There were losses . Some traders had to sell their seats , just get out of the business . But the large majority of our traders came out O.K. The little guy left the pit . That ' s true . But something like three-quarters of the people in the pit remained . It did thin out on Friday when everybody was exhausted . Now , the futures firms , that ' s something else. <> <> // Q. How did the futures brokerage firms do ? // A. They did O.K. , I guess . Our system tells immediately where people stand because we settle everything overnight , not like the five days you have in the stock market . Everybody stayed in business . We raised margins . We raised the margins until it hurt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now , there were some strains . I ' m not going to be silly on this . But the point is , whatever the problems were , we settled on time every morning. <> <> // Q. What was the toughest moment last week for the Merc ? // A. Tuesday around noon when , contrary to our philosophy , we closed the market for the stock index futures 49 minutes . That was the hardest moment in the whole emergency . We had to decide if we could afford to let the whole world , if they wanted to , dump on us . All the other exchanges were closing already. // I was on the phone with John Phelan and he told me at that moment they couldn ' t open many of their major stocks . I ' m talking 60 or 70 or 90 stocks . His words were , " There are no buyers . " In effect , we were the only market. // We had buyers and we had sellers . The price was weak , but there it was . The Merc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone . Phelan had said he was about to go into a meeting and he said it was very likely that the New York Stock Exchange would close altogether. // If word of that got out , our market could have fallen another thousand , two thousand points ( meaning 10 or 20 points on the Standard &; Poor ' s 500-stock index ) . Who knows how far it would have gone . The responsible thing to do was to take a breath. <> <> // Q. So you made your decision not knowing what the Big Board would do ? // A. Phelan had told me there were no buyers . If they officially closed or not , he had already told me , in effect , that we were the only market really operating. // All our evidence points to the following : For the first two hours or more on Monday , when the first wave of panic selling hit , we were the only big market in existence where that selling could come in . We were the pressure valve . We made a market. // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I dare say that the New York Stock Exchange might not have opened that day . At all . It ' s a scary thing. <> <> // Q. You sound like you ' re building your argument against those who would accuse the Merc of being part of the problem because of program trading. // A. Everybody knows that the problem was program trading . It was a conspiracy of computers . I can ' t believe grown men would buy this . They are saying that we have all of this modern technology , but you ' re not supposed to use it. // The evidence that I think will come out , if anybody will care to listen , is that program trading involving the arbitrage between the stock market and the index futures market was at a minimum . Our present facts indicate that about 10 percent of the New York Stock Exchange volume was program-trading arbitrage on Monday . And it was less the rest of the time. <> <> // Q. How about portfolio insurance , where you had heavy selling of the index futures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Was that a big factor in the decline ? // A. There ' s no question that there was some of that , and that it was a factor . But I think that the facts will say that the so-called program trading was minimal . This is a witch hunt , if that ' s what people are looking for . I do know that our market was the first line of defense for many hedgers , who were looking for a way to sell quickly. <> <> // Q. Would the stock index futures market survive without program trading ? // A. It survived before there was program trading . Clearly , it wasn ' t as big before . Volume was nothing like it is now . I think that those who speak about banning program trading are just looking for a scapegoat. <> <> // Q. There has been some criticism that the index futures market is inherently more speculative because the investor puts up just a small fraction of the total value of the contract . Is this creating excess speculation ? // A. I ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell you the average investor does not use the futures market as a substitute for buying stocks . Professionals use it that way sometimes , but not the average investor. <> <> // Q. How do you know that ? // A. We know there is no case for that . Our people are pretty sure that ' s not the case. <> <> // Q. Would you consider changes in your market if they are called for by the Presidential commission to study the plunge ? // A. If the facts justify structural changes in the rules , I ' ll be the first to agree to them . If we can do something to increase the stability of these markets , we ' ll do it . But if the evidence doesn ' t support this , the innocent shouldn ' t be punished . And at this point I don ' t think the evidence supports changes. <> <> // Q. What regulations might help stabilize the market or avoid massive selloffs in the future ? // A. First , I would recommend that everyody quiet down , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for all of this . I think that would serve this nation most. // Second , I think the markets were sending a message , and that the leaders in Washington ought to listen to that message. // Then , I think that we ought to look at the facts and make a decision based on those facts . Maybe you just can ' t make things better . Maybe you can ' t protect people from that kind of a flood . And maybe if you do put something in place to protect for this kind of flood , you ruin your market. <> <> // Q. You have imposed limits on price movements of the index futures contract . Would you consider making them permanent ? // A. It is not necessarily our desire to put ourselves out of business with a limit . And yet that is precisely what we did . We said to the world that we will do the responsible thing , unilaterally , recognizing that if it goes to that limit , other markets could keep trading while we shut down . We wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to suggest that if it is to be done more permanently , it ought to be done fairly , across the board at all exchanges . All the exchanges ought to adopt the same limits . If you want some emergency rule in place , why not one that everybody participates in equally ? You include the New York Stock Exchange . If the limits are placed far enough so that it only affects an emergency , just the extreme , then it could work . You then have the time overnight to catch your breath. <> <> // Q. There has long been tremendous competition between the Merc and the New York Stock Exchange . Will that make it tougher to come up with sensible new regulations if necessary ? // A. These exchanges are businesses and we are very competitive . To some extent , nobody wants his ox gored , and that is a problem . But I think the exchange leaders can make responsible decisions . We showed that we were willing to do that. <> <> // Q. You sound very defensive . Is the Merc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t put it in such stark terms . I don ' t think the facts will come down against us . Don ' t forget the other financial futures markets here and at the other futures exchanges , the currency and Treasury bond futures . All of these markets performed extremely well . You can ' t measure us on the basis of one controversy or one product. <> <> // Q. How do you respond to critics who say that the index futures markets have made the markets too complicated , too volatile ? // A. Let ' s do away with the computer . The world did fine for years without it . Or the television , or the telephone . I never could dance fast , and I ' d rather dance the way we did in the Fifties. // Come on , this is nonsense . The world has changed , it has globalized . Those global markets demand an instant approach to action and the tools to do that . The stock index futures market is one of those tools. //      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
