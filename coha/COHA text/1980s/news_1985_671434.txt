The Intel Corporation , one of Silicon Valley ' s premier companies , underscored the seriousness of the industry ' s troubles when it announced today that its first-quarter sales are likely to run as much as 15 percent below the $431 million it registered in <> <> the fourth quarter. // Gordon E. Moore , chairman and chief executive , said that even with recent cost-cutting moves , " it appears first-quarter net income could be near break-even . " He did say , though , that demand had nearly hit bottom , and " some strengthening " is likely next quarter. // The semiconductor makers are feeling intense competition , and they are marking time while their customers continue to absorb last year ' s huge output of chips. // " The weakness in new orders has been compounded by added capacity becoming available , " said Elliot Levine , an analyst with the First Manhattan Company . " The industry did a superb job of ramping up for new business last year , and now , unfortunately , it is paying the price. " // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s cautionary statement indicated that its situation was " a little worse " than what most Wall Street analysts had envisioned , according to Mr. Levine . The statement came only nine days after it announced its first layoffs in 10 years , covering 900 employees , or about 4 percent of its workforce. // Several other semiconductor companies , including Texas Instruments , National Semiconductor , Monolithic Memories , Zilog Inc . , Seeq Technology and Micron Technology , also recently announced layoffs or spending cutbacks to cushion the unexpectedly steep and protracted drop in orders since the middle of last year. // " This is a temporary correction , but it is very sharp , " said Michael J. Stark , a partner with Robertson , Colman &; Stephens , a brokerage in San Francisco. // The market for semiconductors - the lifeblood of telecommunications , computers , many home appliances and increasingly sophisticated parts for automobiles - grew by nearly 50 percent last year in the United States , to $11. 6 billion in sales , according to the Semiconductor Industry Association . That was record growth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a year. // <> <> Production Usage // But only about half of the 1984 increase actually was used in production , said Sheila Sandow , manager of communications for the trade association , based in San Jose , Calif . Remaining shipments were refused , resold or left in inventories for production schedules for this year , other analysts said. // The ratio of new orders to shipments peaked at a record 1. 66 in December 1983 , but fell steadily throughout 1984 , to 0. 64 in December. // The January figure , at 0. 66 , indicates the " order rate has stabilized , " Miss Sandow said . " But until the excess inventory gets used up , the order rate won ' t start moving higher . Our best estimate is that it won ' t be until the end of the second quarter , or beginning of the third quarter. " // <> <> Supplies Chips to I.B.M. // Intel , typically regarded as one of the strongest companies in the industry , apparently has been harder hit than some of its competitors by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clara , Calif. , makes the microprocessor chip used by the International Business Machines Corporation as the centerpiece for its entry into the microcomputer business four years ago , the hugely successful PC . I.B.M. ' s success spawned more than 60 imitators who use the same Intel- designed microchip , the 8088. // In an interview , Mr. Moore , Intel ' s chairman , acknowledged that the computer makers vying in the I.B.M.- compatible market last year vastly overestimated their sales. // He added that demand for a successor to the 8088 , the 80286 , which I.B.M. uses in its popular AT microcomputer , has been " quite strong , but it doesn ' t carry the whole company. " // <> <> No Plans for Layoffs // Spokesmen for Motorola , Advanced Micro Devices and LSI Logic , in contrast to Intel , said their companies have no plans for layoffs , although orders have slackened in recent months. // " We have all gone through the same phenomena " of declining orders , said Charles E. Thompson , senior vice president and director of world marketing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Still , at this point we ' re very pleased that our major microprocessor customers are people who build cars , rather than personal computers , " // Andrew Rothman , a spokesman for Advanced Micro Devices , in Sunnyvale , Calif. , said the company was " severely impacted " by slowing orders , " but we believe perhaps not as much as some other producers. " // Micron Technology , in Boise , Idaho , said on Monday that it would cut as many as half of its 1 , 250 employees in order to " preserve our financial strength. " // Price-cutting has been widespread across the industry ' s product lines , enough to sharply curb profitability for much of 1985 , Mr. Levine of First Manhattan said . Yet , " things are not as bleak as they seem , " Mr. Levine said . " We ' re probably very close to a turn in the market. " // Many semiconductor stocks have lost most of the ground gained last month when investors ' expectations of improving order rates pushed the stocks higher along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Intel , which was bid at $27. 50 , off $1 , today in the over-the-counter market , and Motorola , which closed at $33. 825 , off 12. 5 cents , on the Big Board , stand at the same price they reached at the end of trading on Jan. 2. // Texas Instruments , the largest chip maker , is down almost $5 this year . It closed today at $112. 75 , up 62. 5 cents , on the New York Stock Exchange . However , Advanced Micro is up $4 on the year , to $33 .
