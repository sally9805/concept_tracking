Fred Tietze has seen the future , right there on his TV monitor . He was trying to prove that commercial messages could be shown on home video without turning people off . He argued that his Esquire fitness tape didn ' t carry a " commercial " at all  --  not in the traditional sense , anyway . Instead , he said , " this is a highly soft integration technique , if you will . " On the screen , a smiling woman in a leotard was about to begin her routine ; but first , she had a few words for the viewer : " It ' s important to wear a good aerobic shoe for balance and support . " Cut to a close-up of her feet , clad in a pair of Autry sneakers . The camera lingered for a moment , then cut away . " See ? Soft integration , " said Tietze , a vice president of Polaris Communications Group , which produces how-to videos under the Esquire magazine name . " We ' re finding tremendous interest by sponsors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They recognize that the way people deal with media has changed forever . Network TV ' s ( audience ) share has been decreasing , magazine circulation has been flat for years . More sponsors see they should have their messages . . . on cassette . It ' s exciting . We ' re dealing with something that has no history . The question is , where do you go with it ? " Welcome to the world of sponsored video . People who bought videocassette recorders to escape Madison Avenue are in for a shock . Everybody was bullish about sponsored video at the recent New York International Home Video Market . As Leo Scullin of the Young &; Rubicam ad agency put it : " Home video is in its infancy , but it has unlimited opportunity . Video can give an extra spin to our advertising efforts . " Advertisers are eyeing video the same way they used to look at cable TV and color TV . They didn ' t take cable seriously until one-third of all households bought the service . And now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 50 percent are expected to by year ' s end . Faced with sponsored video , the producers are happy , because they need bucks to make a high-quality tape . The distributors are happy , because they need help to get the tapes into a wider variety of stores . And the consultants are positioning themselves ; three of them have written a 150-page primer for would-be sponsors . " The problem is , nobody knows how consumers feel . They were not invited ; this was an industry convention . But , in casual conversations , concerns were voiced over how the folks at home would react . Fred Tietze said : " The sponsors know that people zap commercials all the time ( on their VCRs ) . And they ' re going to have to figure out how to deal with that . " Much thought is already being expended on this . The biggest splash was made this year when Pepsi teamed with Paramount to put a 2-minute soda commercial on the home-video version of " Top Gun . " Pepsi doesn ' t call it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s a " video short . Two million tapes have been purchased  --  most at $26. 95 , a low price for a mega-hit movie , and made possible because Pepsi chipped in $8 million for promotion . Everyone in the industry is awed by the Pepsi precedent . Ralph Hoaglund , the business whiz who founded the CVS drugstore empire and is now eager to buy a video-store chain , said last week : " The special-interest tapes ( instructional fare , such as cooking and exercising ) are greatly untapped . Producers can get , say , a food-product sponsor and sell the tape in a supermarket . People who think like that will start a whole new wave . If you can get a food sponsor for a tape that has Paul Newman or Meryl Streep talking about health , then you ' ll see sales that ' ll knock everything else sideways . " But despite the acceptance of Pepsi ' s " video short , " most of the visionaries seem to favor a more subtle approach to product-pushing . They worry about viewers ' zapping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They see home video not as just an extension of TV , but as a new medium that requires a new kind of message  --  a message that can ' t be zapped . In other words , a message that ' s woven into the fabric of the program . " Soft integration " is a big favorite thus far , although there are gradations of softness . Another fledgling favorite is the " infomercial . " The word is not in the dictionary , but it ' s real to Betsy Wood Knapp . As president of Wood Knapp &; Co. , a Los Angeles video firm , she has produced a series of cooking tapes inspired by material from Bon Appetit magazine ( which her husband owns ) . In a separate segment at the end of each program , the host gives advice on choosing wine . " The bottle happens to be a Gallo bottle , and you can see the label , " said Knapp . " It ' s not going to pull the wool over anyone ' s eyes . But it doesn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from our sponsor . ' It ' s an infomercial . " I think sponsorship will enable people to produce with larger budgets and get better quality , " she said . " But Gallo doesn ' t even like to be considered a ' sponsor . ' Let ' s just say we ' worked ' with them . There has to be new creativity about how a sponsor is going to appear on video . Is this medium more like TV or like a book ? I think it ' s like a book , in that you pick it up for your own use . TV is more passive . But we don ' t expect commercials in books . And that leads me to believe that video commercials should be pretty low-key. "
