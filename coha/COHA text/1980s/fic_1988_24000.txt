AMERICA COMPETES By Allan Gurganus he National Fundament of the Arts  --  all too aware of its jeopardized fiscal standing  --  announces what may be its final competition . At her recent news conference , Fundament director Dorothy McPhee repeatedly stressed the need , at this moment of world crisis and sharp cutbacks , for continuing artistic optimism among Americans . The prominent west wall of a large Washington office building will be given over to the provocative design theme " America , where have you come from , where are you bound ? " The space in question is windowless , and measures 555 by 310 feet ( see attached diagram ) . If you are a non- , semi- , or fully professional artist of American citizenship , and over eighteen years of age , you qualify to enter . Written proposals should accompany the drawn-to-scale renderings . Winner ( one only ) will be announced May 5 and the mural will be completed in time for a nationally televised July 4 unveiling by the First Lady . Due to the number of expected participants , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any entry 's loss or damage . Ours is an Equal Opportunity competition . The judge 's decision will be final . ? Dear Miss McPhee and other Fundament Folks , Would you kindly mail the first mural packets to my Massachusetts studio instead of the Manhattan address I gave you before ? I expect to be up here on our little farm for three luxurious months . I 'm planning to paint in the mornings Allan Gurganus ' s note ! Oldest Living Confederate Wid- ow Tells All will be published by Knopf next year . and spend evenings poring over the proposals . Being the final authority in all this  --  well , I think I 'm game and capable . I do take it seriously and am eager to see the first responses . So is Lucy , my wife . She 'll be here for a few more weeks and has agreed to help . Today we cleared off two plank tables in the kitchen . Lucy carried back issues of magazines to a chicken coop we use for storage . I 've dusted and polished both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bombard us with that first batch of American potential . I sign myself , More enthusiast than judge , Kermit Waley Dearest Sirs ( or Madames ) , I had the distinct good fortune to serve on the Beautify America Committee a few years back . I 've done a little research and , I believe , I am the only one from Mrs. Lyndon Johnson 's select group still actively planting on the civic level . What you 've got is a long wall with a westerly facing . In Oct. 1916 , my late mother and her head gardener planted forty boxwoods and lots of English ivy sprigs around our local branch post office . All forty shrubs still thrive , and every inch of the building 's outer walls is now nicely ivied . Meanwhile , inside , murals done during the Thirties by three New Yorkers ( painted twenty years after Mother planted ) are now water-stained and flaking like some rash . They were n't so great to begin with . The farm children depicted have huge necks on them and are smelting iron ( on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is absolutely inaccurate , even for back then . Each time I go to mail a letter , I come out more angry . Then , luckily , I see the English ivy plus those stately boxwoods  --  always so soothing . Time can not wither nor custom stale their infinite variety . In the greater D.C. area , wisteria will do nicely for you as a wall climber . its perfume would offer a lovely bonus to passing office workers . Pyracantha can eventually be espaliered , and its orange autumnal berries provide a visual feast , then a literal one for migratory cedar waxwings forced to lay over en route to havens in the South . Think in terms of perennials . Do n't settle for fast-fading painting fads . When you and I are pushing up daisies , my suggestion will go right ahead without us . The miracle of photosynthesis remains as up-to-date as tomorrow 's newspaper , and a whole lot more comforting . What better symbol of our national hope than a plant  --  well chosen , expertly maintained , grounded in native soil but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Astabula , NC zip 27801 Dear Judge Artist of National Distinction , I 've always thought one art carries right over into another and that really sensitive people can spot true quality in other similar type artistic persons . For this reason , I am sending not a mural but a children 's hook , one of my best , Jenny the Wren 's Vienna Misadventures . I also illustrated it . Some people have said my book 's wren is sketched much more realistically than the Viennese buildings  --  but how many English-speaking kids care that much about Austrian architecture anyway ? What they love is Jenny the Wren herself . Jenny has sure been to lots of publishers lately . I 'm still trying to get her into the right hands . Suggestions ? Anyway , enjoy , enjoy . Here is Jenny the Wren 's Vienna Misadventures . I am , Interdisciplinarily , Ms. Mirabelle Braith Rte. 3 , Blackfoot Hwy . Billings , Montana Dear Contest , My Dad he did good drawings . He work out at Moss Furniture evenings and the Grave Yard shift Kenilworth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ branch in one hand and the arrows . He love that Eagle . Please send these back if they do n't win it . My Dad died . He did Eagles on placemat menus from where our Momma worked waitressing . Miss Martin , the teacher , she told my wife to enter this . Dad was 74 and never sick a day in his life . He was born at West Virginia butcome out here when Momma need to for her breathing . Rollo Krause Phoenix , Arizona Miss McPhee , There was no return address on this bundle . Our posters said we would n't send back applications but this seems an exceptional case . Can you trace this Krause fellow , maybe through the teacher the poor guy mentions ? Lucy studied every one of these menus , all yellowed and obviously used before the old man drew eagles on them . Somehow , when I agreed to do this judging , I expected ... perhaps a higher degree of " professionalism , " whatever that is . To tell the truth , it 's hard to recall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ essays " is a humbling experience . Many of the drawings are done in Crayola , Bic pens , even finger paints . One was sketched in homemade charcoal and had not been sprayed with fixative . By the time our mailman lugged it up the front stairs with two dozen others , nothing remained in the envelope but a smudged piece of cardboard and three pinches of crumbly black powder . So many people want this commission so much . Lucy keeps telling me I 'm far too tenderhearted to make this kind of decision . But she 's the one who laid the eagle menus all over our kitchen counter and spent a whole rainy afternoon shaking her head and repeating , " Do you realize how lucky we are , Kermit ? " Anyway , Miss McPhee , we 're wading knee-deep through the heartbreakers , trudging onward in search of an undiscovered genius from Utah or some such place . Full speed ahead , I remain , Yours , Kermit Committee dear ! Stand by , have cheer ! My every fifth-grade boy and girl Would simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we picked a theme , A happy one , a cheering scheme . We chose the subject of " Balloons ! " In poster paint , bright moon-doubloons , We 'll soon splash up a pretty grouping To keep those bureaucrats from drooping . Balloons of every size and color , An interracial cure for dolor . A paint contractor , my husband is . He 'll build our scaffolds . ( Such a whiz ! ) He says he 'll do it all for cost . Four floors is high , but no kid 'll be lost ! He 'll spray our mural with clear acrylic After they 're done , my class angelic . / ? ? They 're daily bused right past this spot , Against their will , like it or not , So why not give them some say-so , In how this country 's going to grow . If chosen , they will simply glow . If not , they 'll think Democracy Smells oddly like Hypocrisy . If you guys shatter such high hopes , They 'll call all judges corrupt dopes . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ End Kids . It 's up to you , you Judge , you Pontius , It 's up to you . It 's not my conscience . I hope selecting will prove merry , 1 sign myself , Clarissa Cherry C.A.

You still think they came over here for religious freedom ? Ha . This kind of federal spending really irks me no end . And why do these expensive projects always get put up on the East coast ? But if you intend to go through with this giveaway show , there 's something I must say , loud and clear . As an atheist , I now tell this committee not to hint that so-called divine inspiration had anything to do with our nation 's founding . Any picture that even touches on the Godhead will hring cries of outrage from this taxpayer and others like myself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choose something like Pilgrims on their knees , or some ethnically mixed group all looking up while their hands are pressed together , I can not be held responsible for what my organization might do . This should be said , this should he stressed . Forewarned , forearmed . MacN ulty 30 Foy St. L.A. Dear Dorothy and her helpers at the Fundament , A progress report : well , it 's slow going at best . My wife left this afternoon . She returned to her new job at an art auction house in the city . She waited three years for this position and I 'm glad she 's so happy with it , but I already miss her . Lucy tried her hand at the mural entries but soon got very morose . She began blaming the National Fundament for how sad these things are . So I took her by the hand and literally led her away from the growing mounds of evidence . Now I 'm alone just as the sun sets . Me , and what has suddenly become another real presence here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the artistry gummed into all those packets , mostly manila brown . Some are white . One of today 's came wrapped in red construction paper , bound with gold clips , like a gift . Our foyer is already jammed . The long-suffering postman daily stacks them higher , neatly as firewood . Maybe I should have become a postal clerk instead of this  --  this , whatever I am . My job , I recognize , is simply to choose one winner from the hundreds . Obviously , that 's what competition is all about . Could you please send me your phone number ? Your home phone . That way I can reach you in the wee hours . This farmhouse always starts creaking just before dawn . I think I 'm going to maybe need some encouragement . Kermit To Giveaway People : Let 's face it . The Mayflower was a hotbed of foment and atheism . The sooner we admit this to ourselves , the better off we 'll be . Americans would sleep easier if they realized that our nation was n't settled by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of malcontents , that 's who . The excess nuts and cranks and failures . Riffraff who shot their bolt early on , drifters who were miserable else I , w .. ere . Stick that in your mural . Or else . MacNulty L. A. Dear Miss McPhee , Kermit says we met at that big embassy party last August in Washington . He tells me that you 're attractive and conversant and that you graduated from Smith . So did my sister ( Pepie Bainbridge McCloud , Class of ' 61 , the choreographer ) . My memory for faces is notoriously bad but from all I 've heard about you , and since you chose my husband as the one American painter to judge this mural business , I feel I can speak frankly . Ten days ago , I left Kermit in our little 19th cent . farmhouse in the Berkshires . I now have a part-time job as a buyer , so when my official vacation was over , naturally I came back to N.Y . Now I wish I 'd given up this whole idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daily andhe assures me that things are fine , but he sounds so vague and tired . Miss McPhee , nothing you told Kermit prepared him for the ordeal of judging . There should be at least three jurists . When I left , packets were stacked on every available surface . The few I managed to flip through nearly broke my heart . I 'm still depressed . Some ladies ' craft guild from Ocala , Florida , wanted to macrame a " snood-type shawl " for the entire building . One man sent his dead father 's pencil sketches , done on the backs of filthy Howard Johnson 's menus . A fifteenyear-old girl mailed us all her writings , a steamer trunk full . She 'd done " paraphrases of Emily Dickinson . " The child had been through each Dickinson poem and reduced it to a pat moral lesson . For instance , poems about death ( a quite large percentage ) she often summarized : " You only come this way once , so while you 're at it , grab for all the gusto you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demure handwriting , if she did n't win this , she guessed she 'd just go out and drown herself . What kind of superhuman can withstand this ? Certainly not Kermit . You hired him as an aesthetic authority , not a human-relations counselor . Kermit , despite my years of coaching , has never really learned to say No . His own painting has not been going at all well lately . The last thing he needs is this extra burden of guilt about others ' pitiful problems . For the first time since he was nineteen , since his Socialist days , Kermit has begun to stammer . Just as before , on words beginning with " M. " He has also become dreadfully insomniac . I 'd get up and find him downstairs , drinking milk , standing before the kitchen table heaped with amateurish drawings . His critical eye , as you  --  of all people  --  must know , is usually incredibly acute . In N.Y. , gallery owners seek him out for advice . He can spot the slightest clumsiness or slickness . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see how Kermit 's discrimination was slipping . He 'd bring in some totally trashy sketch of a wood duck viewed from three angles . Sub-calendar art , really . He 'd say , Of course , it 's rough , but what energy the thing has , a primitive purity all its own . I told him , Kermit , what on earth are you talking about ? If one of your students had done it , you 'd flunk the kid for sure , and here you 're going to award this a national gold medal ? He admitted 1 was probably right , but he shuffled out still studying the ducks , tilting his head as he does only when looking at something really first-rate . Well , I 've gone on too long . Miss McPhee , I 'm sure you see my point . Kermit is simply the wrong man for this job . I know him . Essentially , he 's a child ; he has a child 's simple faith that there is one right and honorable response to all situations . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kermit is that oddity , a moral person . Or at least someone trying to be , which is rarity enough . For nine long years , I 've sheltered Kermit Waley . His fame is certainly deserved , and since the start , I 've enjoyed it with him . He was sickly as an adolescent . His early political days  --  handing out leaflets on windy street corners , sleeping in basements  --  nearly killed him . Kermit 's dealer and all our friends give me credit for keeping him so productive . Now I find him embracing this disaster . He does n't know ( and must never ) that I casually asked a congressman in my family to submit my husband 's name for this job . I thought it might be fun for Kermit , somehow relaxing and good for his work . I assumed that only other professionals would apply ; I did n't count on these strangers from the Midwest with their pathetic obsessions . Please , Miss McPhee , he responsible . It 's like some disease you 're mailing to our farm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influence had any effect ; but however Kermit got nailed with this awful task , it 's a mistake and it must cease . Many other distinguished painters , equally eminent , really do need the money . They would be honored to take over , even this late . Please find someone with a little more distance on human misery , someone less emotional than my over-conscientious husband . I thank you , Lucy McCloud-Waley Most Honorable Art Jurists : Quilts are definitely where it 's at in this big land of ours right now . I was knocked dead by the Whitney 's quilt show some years back and have been a madman collector ever since . threw over my job as an investment banker and just immersed myself in folk art . Questing for choice examples , I 've made treks to Canada , Wales , and Iowa . Here , after months of loving work , is my design . It meshes and blends so many mellow American folk motifs : the star , eagle , flag , log cabin , etc . Alongside the wall in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 would set up a huge circus tent ( see Itemized Budget , enclosed ) . I 'd fill this big top with sixty West Virginia mountain craftsperson &; ( These women now work for me  --  at decent wages  --  making quilts and one-of-a-kind slipcovers for my three N.Y . and two London shops . ) Many of these gals have never left the mountains . Think of the **28;2871;TOOLONG angle . Talk about " Where have you come from , where are you bound ? " ! I 'd construct a huge quilting frame ( three lowest bids enclosed ) . In our tent , the ladieswould commence stitching as only they can . Their quilt will be made from Grade A , non-fading fabrics to offset weather and the ravages of aging . The finished product will be hoisted onto the wall , totally covering the westerly exposure . It will , you might say , give this bleak steely government building a security blanket of the homey kind long lost and , I think we 'd all agree , pretty badly needed just now . During rain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a massive roller like a window shade , only enormous and more reliable . Ours will be the hugest such comforter-coverlet ever made by mankind . ( The Guinness Book of Records does n't even list quilts . That 's how unprecedented my idea is . ) My seamstresses are a sight . Some wear sunbonnets ( for real ! ) and their faces are eroded like you can not believe . We 're talking mega-Americana here . Small replicas of " The Official US Security Quilt " ( like it ? ) will be sold as collectors ' items . I 've established contacts for major nationwide distribution in your finer stores . How am I sounding ? A big fat percentage will get ploughed right back into the ailing National Fundament itself . Given the current chill of international relations , what , I ask , could be more reassuring than a many-colored patchwork quilt , handcrafted by women so American it hurts , a quilt plenty big enough for one and all ?

The lady said I was too prolific for my own good . But on the street three weeks ago , the littlest Ralston child asked me what Jenny the Wren was up to now ? She asked which kids in what country Jenny was helping these days ? A good sign  --  Sally Ralston asking about Jenny the Wren ! I certainly do n't want to overuse your precious time .

You 've chosen to ignore my request and my repeated calls . Kermit answers his phone only occasionally now . He says the postman is still bringing applications , whole cartons full . My sister remembers you as captain of the lacrosse team at Smith and , frankly , she says you were " hard as nails , a very tough cookie , indeed .

If in four days you have not named another Judge for " America , Where Have You Come From @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll find yourself abruptly unemployed . Uncle Carl knows nothing about Art but he is inordinately fond of Kermit . I do n't usually resort to this kind of string-pulling . I 'm averse to it on principle . But I 'm fighting here for my husband 's safety . There is really nothing personal , Miss McPhee , in my wanting to see your head on a platter . Concerned , Lucy McCloud-Waley You , In addition  --  any steeple , any kids praying at bedtime while their parents look on , any cross or cross-shaped structure , the star of David , any and all angels . Allusions to the so-called Holy Eucharist , any group of singing persons holding what might be missals or hymnbooks . Anybody wearing miters , starched collars , rabbinical getups or choirlike garments . Anything even faintly touching on what I 've mentioned . If I find this stuff up on that wall come July , stand by for retribution . We all know who picked . MacNulty L. A. Dear Dorothy at the Fundament , Did I tell you that our farmhouse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Melville lived here . Supposedly , Melville himself cut the tin weather vane , a prickly mermaid . My wife 's family gave us this place . Lucy has an independent income . Her great-grandfather McCloud made his money through cotton mills back before unions and child-labor laws . Lucy is very protective of me . She thinks I 'm somewhat sickly and unstable . Maybe I am . Would you consider advancing the deadline so I wo n't get any more ? I seem to be falling behind . The stacks certainly do grow . The mailman now takes the packets straight to our chicken coop . I 've taped copies of the contest rules over the kitchen sink and near our four-poster and alongside the toilet . I 'm so glad it says I 'm not responsible for " any entry 's loss or damage . " You told me that my being the judge would be kept strictly secret , Dorothy . You promised . I 've begun getting phone calls here . Only two of our best N.Y . friends have this unlisted number . We 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea and probably a good one ) . So it 's always an event when the phone rings . Last night , I had three long-distance calls from some crazy man in Los Angeles who 's sure I 'm going to put up another Sistine Ceiling . ( If one were submitted , I 'd leap at the chance . ) He growled about the Pope 's " nephews " ? a whole fleet of Vatican callboys . I said I did n't want to know and hung up , but the phone started ringing again almost immediately . Some woman from Billings , Montana , reversed the charges . I 've always loved that name , Montana . Dakota , Montana : words so dry and beautiful . I accepted the charges . I do n't know why . She was calling from a bar . I could hear Country and Western music in the background and sometimes war whoops like in Wild West saloons . She whispered . She told me that a wren had good feelings about me . The jukebox was still blaring when , over and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phone . I hung up , then took the receiver off It whined , so I slid some socks over it , then wrapped it in an army blanket and stuffed it into a desk drawer . I 'm scared , Dorothy . The mailman arrived again this morning . I 've started giving him five or ten dollars a day . This is a sleepy town and he 's never worked so hard . He came in with three new boxes and said , " Tippie Wilkins is my niece . " I told him , " All right . " I went in and found Tipple 's application right on top . Her idea concerns whales . Tippie 's just thirteen . She sent me her school photo . Tippie says there are fewer whales every year . Extinction , I 've found , is a favorite theme among our younger contestants . I 'm keeping notes on trends in applicants ' ages and geography . Our country is so vast . Regionalism will never die , will it ? My notes are around here somewhere . How much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Dorothy . My reputation as a painter is mostly based on one rave review , one show of seven paintings in 1969 . I 've been gliding on that ever since . I teach part-time but really live on Lucy 's money . I have n't sold a large painting in four years . If this makes you feel I 'm unfit to judge a national competition , I understand . But please keep me a secret , Dorothy . Why do n't you call me ? ( Let it ring twice then hang up and call again . ) You have n't written me since this judgment began . I 've only seen your handwriting on the check you sent . Tell Lucy to call the same way , in our code . I did n't know there were so many Americans over eighteen . Dorothy , send me an assistant . It 's getting lonely up here . K Kermit dear , I 'm sorry our splendid phone talk was cut off just now . I 'll repeat the details for good measure . I arrive by Greyhound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2:30 P. M. , your time , Eastern Time . I 'm not sure how far from Northampton your farm is , but during the drive we can get even better acquainted . From the tone of your sad gentle voice , I feel I know you so well already . You 've been too too kind . I wonder if you even understand what a terrible thing isolation is . Especially isolation in Montana . This town made me its laughingstock when I was just eleven . You know what people say when I go by ' ' Look who 's louse . " They all say that . I know it 's hard for an established artist such as yourself to believe . How does it happen that I , the one person for miles around who loves Art , who aspires to create , should he their favorite victim ? Now I 'm over thirty and it still goes on . Every day another little slight or humiliation . A person can hardly shop . Luckily , we 'll have time to talk things over , my new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to come back here again . Someday , they 'll all regret these years they 've taunted and hurt me . Oh well , see you very soon now , All the love on earth , from us , Mirabelle and Jenny the Wren Judge of It , Still we wait for Daddy Eagles . Everyday at the mailbox I do n't find them yet . Miss Martin the teacher says you all have . plenty of time by now to pick . If you loose the only Eagles he sketch down on placemats I get mighty upset . My boys are big as I was then . They say to say they will come looking for the one that failed to send their grandads only Eagle drawings back here . Like I said , my Dad he died . There will never be another Eagle drawing done at the counter while he waited for Momma to finish up her last customers . My boys get mean sometime . They all have pickups and will really come to find the missing Eagles no matter how far . I can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treated wrong or that my dead dad gets treated bad either . I just ask you to respect a persons property and also our feelings . It is my right to ask back what is really mine . Somebody dead drew those ones . There can be no new ones from someone who is dead . I should not of mailed the only ones of something . I just wanted somebody outside our family to say his Eagles had something extra . Everytime that mail truck leaves us nothing I feel that much more low and the boys they get way madder . Just please . Rollo Krause Phoenix Ariz . Dorothy , Fundament , Yesterday morning , 1 decided to answer the phone . 1 wanted Lucy to call so I had to put it hack on the hook . I wanted you to call . Jenny the Wren reversed the charges , this time from Cleveland . I was smart and would n't accept . I could hear the train or bus departures being announced , and over the operator 's voice , Jenny kept chirping at me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and firebombing the wall . Around three , little Tippie got on the phone . She played me a whole record of whale voices . Tippie held the receiver near the speaker . Have you ever heard the whales singing , Dorothy ? Have you ever heard anything so sad ? It was like an echo of an echo of a human cry . The Russians and Japanese slaughter them for face cream . They should n't . Tipple told me step-by-step how they do it . She started to whimper . I hung up , then yanked the phone out of the wall . I hope everyone will understand . All afternoon I 've worked on my own application . I 've decided to apply . My entry will incorporate all the worthiest aspects of those who have no chance at all .

It 's done in shades of pink and is comforting . My mother studied scarf dancing and poise as a girl . She also took elocution lessons . Every time she got the least hit drunk , she 'd say , with real expression what they 'd taught her to : There 's so much good in the worst of us And so much had in the best of us That it does n't behoove any of us To talk about the rest of us . Right ? K. Miss McPhee , I 'm sending this to your former place of employment , hoping they will forward it . I wanted you to know what l found in Massachusetts . The phone went out of order and I rushed right up there . I want you to know what you 're responsible for . I walked into an abandoned house . The place was absolutely filthy .

I 'd had the good sense to bring someone from the village along , a handyman who 'd done work for us . Mr. Bryce went into the bedroom first and came out with a strange expression . He said , " It should be covered up . " A cardboard suitcase blocked the doorway . I stepped over this , and , there , curled up in our bed , was a tiny elderly woman asleep and naked . She wore only high heels and a feathered hat . When I woke her , she look around so startled she began whistling for help . She kept doing it , shrilly and in bird imitations that were absolutely credible and absolutely horrifying . Finally 1 convinced her I meant no harm . I asked where Kermit was . I begged her to use words . At last . from under the sheets , she whispered in English , " Today he 's gone off to decide . " Mr. Bryce and I rushed out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Bryce went down by the pond since I was too frightened to look there . I tramped around for an hour or more , still in my city heels , still holding my purse , screaming his name hysterically . Then at the edge of the woods , I saw our red wheelbarrow . A few drawings were in it , and beyond that , uphill , in a little clearing under the evergreens , Kermit had hidden himself among the applications . He 'd piled all those packets neatly into four-foot stacks . The stacks stood like columns , and as a roof over these , he had placed a large stretched blank canvas . Draped across this was a patchwork quilt he 'd inherited from a relative . I struggled up the hill in my ridiculous shoes . He seemed pleased to see me , he beckoned me into his little shack . I squatted on the spruce needles and crawled in . He needed a shave but otherwise looked all right . He looked wonderful , in fact . Very animated . He 'd torn one corner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spread before him , like a puzzle . He was trying to fit all these colored shards together . I sat there , crouched beside him , watching . I could hear Bryce 's voice echoing across the pond , calling Mr. Waley , Mr. Waley . Kermit told me quietly , " This is our winner , Lucy . What do you think ? " He went on contentedly arranging the torn pieces . He was humming . I put my hand on his shoulder , so soothed to see him alive . The strangeness of this but we were in , of his activity , did n't strike me till much later . Bryce took the woman to a nearby bus station . I never found out who she was or how she came to be in our bed . I 'm not at all sorry that you 've lost your job , Miss McPhee . We sold the farm . We had to .

He 's beginning to make jokes again , though he still looks so fatigued . Just after it happened , he kept repeating , " We are one big unhappy family , and poor , are n't we , Lucy ? " To appease him , I said , " I suppose we are , dear . " He has been stunted as an artist and as a man by what this competition has shown him , Miss McPhee . I hope you are satisfied . Since all of this occurred , I have felt a great need to write down these details for you . Lucy McCloud-Walley ?

Appropriations formerly earmarked for the Arts and Humanities have been deemed more urgently needed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fundament director , Randolph Gleason , formerly Senior Vice President of Boeing Aircraft , stated that , should rerouted funds ever be returned to the Fundament , future contests will probably offer themes far more specific , far less open-ended and inflammatory than that of this year 's competition . When asked if the mural competition was canceled because of lack of national interest , the new director commented that , on the contrary , if anything , there had been an excess of response . The entries , Gleason explained , tended to be " highly individualistic and single-issue oriented . " Questioned about this , Gleason would not elaborate . He then pronounced the mural contest 's offiCial dismantling as well as the official withdrawal of its all-too-provocative competition question : " America , where have you come from , where are you bound ? " Applications can not be returned . ?
