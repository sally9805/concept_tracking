When Congress finally left town last month for its Christmas break , it left behind a Sword of Damocles hanging over a shaky world economy : the Omnibus Trade Bill of 1987 . With record-high trade-deficit figures just released for the month of October , House Speaker Jim Wright seized the occasion to insist that the trade legislation would be the House ' s " top priority " when it returns this month , and congressional leaders set March 1 as a target for finishing the bill . Only President Reagan ' s veto pen stands in the way of implementation of the protectionist trade bill . A review of nine key trade votes in the Senate and eight such votes in the House last year shows that while support for protectionism remains fairly high in both houses , a presidential veto of the trade bill appears sustainable  --  though only by a narrow margin . The latest Free Trade Index compiled by the Competitive Enterprise Institute finds that House members last year voted to maintain barrier-free trade corridors 41% of the time while senators did so 50% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CEI ' s ratings for the 99th Congress ( House 35% , Senate 45% ) , they reflect a fundamental change in the center of gravity for major trade legislation : Instead of relying on political posturing in expectation of a presidential veto , congressmen are now seeking legislative compromise in the hope of forestalling a veto . In the House , voting on trade issues reveals extremely partisan divisions . The average free-trade score for Republicans is 84 , compared with 11 for Democrats . Eighty-six members qualify as " free-trade heroes " with perfect scores of 100 ( all but Oregon Democrat Les AuCoin are Republicans ) , while 155 members brandish " merchants of mercantilism " scores of 0 ( Maryland ' s Helen " Sledge Hammer " Bentley is the lone Republican ) . Although the numbers indicate strong support for free trade among House Republicans , that ' s not entirely true . Most of the Republican votes were against such blatantly protectionist items in the trade bill as exchange-rate manipulation , Third World debt bailouts , more stringent disclosure requirements for foreign investors , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deficits ( Rep. Richard Gephardt ' s amendment ) . At heart , however , the Republican alternative to the Democrats ' trade bill stopped well short of challenging the broad , bipartisan consensus in the House that favors strengthening the less blatant forms of protectionism . Republicans could denounce the protectionist effects of tariffs and quotas but accomplish the same results by stacking the deck against foreign competition with new procedures for international trade disputes . Few Republicans challenged items in the trade bill that would reduce presidential discretion in implementing protectionist measures , lower standards for import relief , adopt private rights of action against foreign " dumping , " and increase the use of countervailing duties . Senate voting on trade issues was less partisan , with the average Republican supporting free trade 63% of the time , compared with the average Senate Democrat score of 38% . The apparent increase in Democrat support  --  from an average score of 28% in the 99th Congress  --  reflects two factors : the absence of votes on textile-quota legislation that was so popular in the previous Senate , plus the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Senate  --  which made their leaders responsible for brokering a compromise trade bill acceptable to both the House and the president . In fact , the Senate version of the bill approved last July was much more of a consensus vehicle than the House bill , passed in April . ( This doesn ' t apply to a potentially controversial change in trade law  --  Sen. Ernest Hollings ' s so-called ESP exporters ' sales price amendment that rigs the margins in anti-dumping cases . It was slipped into the trade bill surreptitiously on a voice vote . ) How do individual congressmen score on the free-trade list ? In the House , Republican leader Robert Michel and Republican Conference Chairman Richard Cheney lead the ranks of 100% free traders , while the Sons of Smoot-Hawley ( scores of 0 ) include House Speaker Jim Wright , Majority Whip Tony Coelho and John Dingell , chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee . Moderately free-trade Democrats include Patricia Schroeder ( 75 ) , Robert Mrazek ( 63 ) , Timothy Penny ( 63 ) , Charles Schumer ( 63 ) and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Senate ranks are Republicans Daniel Evans ( 100 ) , Phil Gramm ( 89 ) , Gordon Humphrey ( 89 ) , John McCain ( 89 ) and Dan Quayle ( 89 ) . Leading supporters of free-trade principles among Democrats include Alan Cranston ( 78 ) , John Kerry ( 78 ) and Bill Bradley ( 67 ) . Perfect paragons of protectionism in the Senate are Democrats Dennis DeConcini ( 0 ) , Carl Levin ( 0 ) and Richard Shelby ( 0 ) . The most protectionist Republican senators appear to be Strom Thurmond ( 11 ) , William Cohen ( 22 ) and Arlen Specter ( 22 ) . On the presidential campaign trail , there is Republican Rep. Jack Kemp ( 100 ) , Senate Minority Leader Robert Dole ( 56 ) and Democrat Rep. Richard Gephardt ( 0 ) . Paul Simon and Albert Gore missed all but a few trade votes this year , which makes their scores unreliable . ( Each had Free Trade Index scores of 13 in the 99th Congress . ) Presidential candidates should take note of the average Free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ states : 66% for the Iowa delegation and 88% for the New Hampshire delegation . Shortly after the 1986 elections , Alan Reynolds wrote on this page ( " Will Congress Be More Protectionist ? " Nov. 14 , 1986 ) that " the new senators are not more protectionist , on balance , than the Republicans they replace . " In fact , new Democratic senators replacing Republicans in the 100th Congress have compiled average free-trade scores of 35% , as compared with their predecessors ' 50% . A comparison of the average score for all new senators ( 43 ) and all departing senators ( 48 ) is a little closer . What does all this mean in terms of predicting support to override possible presidential vetos of trade legislation this year ? By looking at a few core votes on trade protectionism in last year ' s House ( Gephardt amendment : 218-214 ; final passage of omnibus trade bill : 290-137 ; final passage of textile-quota legislation : 263-156 ) , it ' s possible to make a few predictions :  --  Chances of sustaining a presidential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( when a more protectionist trade bill passed 295-115 ) , but still unlikely.  --  Gephardt-type mandatory retaliation against countries that have trade surpluses with the U.S. will be severely watered down in the House-Senate conference.  --  A veto of textile quotas can not be overridden . In the Senate , a key vote involving the amendment that would have permitted presidential discretion in import-relief decisions ( 41-55 ) and final passage of the omnibus trade bill ( 71-27 ) indicate that there is just barely enough potential support for free-trade principles to sustain a presidential veto of the final trade bill . Although an Oct. 23 letter to the president , signed by 38 GOP senators , opposed enactment of " protectionist " legislation , it contained enough weasel wording to suggest that several signers might still back away from upholding a veto . When the impulse to flirt with protectionism rises again in the next session of Congress , legislators most likely will do little more than strip the trade bill of its most obnoxious features . The conference committee probably will come up with a final product that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which will still be loaded with anti-trade , anti-consumer features that create a breeder reactor for world-wide protectionism . This trade equivalent of " safe sex " will pose great dangers for an unsteady international economy . On Oct. 28 then-Labor Secretary William Brock urged sponsors of the trade bill to withdraw it because its passage would cause " rampant panic " in global financial markets . Instead of seizing the offensive , administration officials fired up their waffle irons and merely described Mr. Brock ' s suggestion as " interesting . " Let ' s hope Mr. Brock , now Sen. Dole ' s campaign manager , will be able to influence his new boss , who in turn will stiffen the spines of Senate Republicans and fill a leadership vacuum in support of free-trade principles . Nothing short of an unequivocal veto pledge by the White House will head off final passage of the trade bill . If Republican senators and the president form a mutually reinforcing support group behind free trade , Congress finally can " just say no " to protectionism this year.  --  - Mr. Miller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Index.
