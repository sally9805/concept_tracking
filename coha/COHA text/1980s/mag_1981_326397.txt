To get acquainted with Reagan and help himself back home <P> One thing that Ronald Reagan has restored to the White House is a sense of pomp and ceremony . On a balmy spring day last week , hundreds of Executive Office workers turned out to watch as the President greeted West German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt in grand style . There were ruffles and flourishes when Reagan and Nancy strode out of the White House to greet the Chancellor 's limousine at the diplomatic entrance . While guns boomed out a 19-gun salute , a Marine band played the German national anthem and then the Star-Spangled Banner . There was a flashy presentation of colors by an honor guard , and a bewigged fife and drum corps , wearing colonial dress , marched by . <P> It was a warm welcome for a troubled friend . In the past few years , countless U.S. diplomats and politicians have flown to Bonn in search of West German support for everything from shoring up the dollar to bolstering NATO 's defenses .

In short , the Chancellor could use some signals of support from Reagan , and the White House knew it . As a senior State Department official put it : " We need to meet him halfway . " <P> Reagan did that and more . In their opening remarks on the White House lawn , both host and guest took care to strike as harmonious a note as possible . A common theme of their addresses was wariness toward the Soviet Union . Reminding listeners that 1981 marks the 20th anniversary of the building of the Berlin Wall , Reagan observed : " On one side of the wall , people live in dignity and democracy ; on the other side , in domination and defeat .

One of his primary concerns was what he perceives as the Administration 's strident saber-rattling against the Soviet Union . The Chancellor has become increasingly critical of Soviet expansionism in the past year . At the same time he fears that the U.S. is not trying hard enough to open a dialogue with the Soviets and thus defuse East-West tensions . " Schmidt wants to be assured that our policy toward the Soviet Union is more than one of simple hostility , " said a senior U.S. diplomat . <P> East-West relations were discussed at length by the two leaders . They conferred twice in the Oval Office , with each meeting lasting about an hour . Top aides for both men were present , and Schmidt did most of the talking .
