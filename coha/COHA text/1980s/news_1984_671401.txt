// KASSALA , the Sudan - Refugees by the tens of thousands are streaming into this desert nation from neighboring Ethiopia , fleeing drought , famine and war. // They walk for as many as eight weeks from their villages and cross the frontier to reach the wretched patch of hills and sand that is the refugee center of Tekl el Bab , outside this town in eastern Sudan . The bleakness of the place that to them is a balm eloquently underscores the degree of misery they escaped. // For most of the more than 25 , 000 people in this place , the only shelter is provided by the looming crags that shield them from the chill of the night and the small , scraggly bushes that give meager respite from the piercing sun . Their ever-growing numbers have seriously strained supplies of food , water , drugs and the energy of relief workers. // According to relief workers , government officials and humanitarian organizations , they are also straining the limited resources of the entire country , where , as in huge swaths of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // In addition to the problems posed by the current wave of refugees , this pro- Western nation is sapped by enormous development problems : an economic quagmire , an insurgency in its southern region , and the demands placed on it by a previous tide of refugees . There is growing concern that , with the continuing influx of refugees and their impact on the social and economic fabric , the nation may soon be overwhelmed. // <> <> An Open-Door Policy // // The Sudan , the largest country in Africa and one of the world ' s most impoverished , has traditionally had an open- door policy toward refugees . It has taken in more than one million in recent years. // The country ' s Office of the Commissioner for Refugees is responsible for administering many projects of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees . And the Sudan ' s law on the right of asylum is considered a model in Africa. // The majority of the refugees are Ethiopians , mainly from the northern provinces of Eritrea and Tigre , who began arriving in 1967 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Chadians and Zairians . Their arrival highlights the plight of a nation . For even as the Sudan ' s borders serve as a magnet for thousands of refugees , an estimated 4. 5 million of its own 22 million people have also been victimized by the drought. // The majority of those now flocking into the country are children , whose pencil-thin bodies , clothed in little more than rags , transmit tales of suffering and tragedy . About two members of every family , most often the very old and the very young , die struggling to make their way here . Each day , measles , malaria , malnutrition , tuberculosis and other ailments claim the lives of about 20 of those who do make it. // These refugees are among more than 110 , 000 from Eritrea and Tigre , where guerrilla warfare complicates the process of getting food to people. // Since Nov. 1 , they have been entering at the rate of 1 , 200 a day . Relief officials say that another 50 , 000 may now be on their way . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of drought and armed conflict have crossed Sudan ' s western border from Chad. // There have been rumors that the Government would close its border with Ethiopia , spurred by a measles epidemic among the refugees . But the Sudanese Commissioner for Refugees says he does not believe that this will be considered , especially if the nation receives enough international aid . Others , however , fear that there may be increased internal pressure from drought-affected Sudanese to limit or stop the flow of people coming in . <> <> ' A Big Problem ' // // " I ' m expecting tens of thousands to come in the coming few weeks , " Abdel Beshir el Ahmadi , the Commissioner for Refugees , said . " It is a big problem that is going to face us . There should be a balance in really helping Sudan . When you have between 1 , 000 and 1 , 500 a day crossing the border to come to us and this number will be multiplied in the coming weeks , we hope the international community will come and help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sudan. " // Thousands of the new refugees are traveling to drought-affected areas , making an already serious situation worse . Refugees who came in previous years and were relocated in permanent rural settlements , with the aim of avoiding pressure on already overburdened urban services and helping the refugees to become self-sufficient , are now experiencing total crop failures and may need additional support. // New arrivals have been chopping down trees for fuel , contributing to the problem of desertification that aggravates Africa ' s food problems . In the Sudan , the Government says the desert is advancing three miles a year . The whole situation has led some to ask whether the generosity of the Sudan toward refugees is ultimately in the best interests of its people. // " Some of the area the new refugees are living on here is usually cropland , " said Mohmed Osman Ali , a Sudanese refugee counselor .

Figures provided by Western donor nations suggested that the harvest of sorghum would be 700 , 000 tons short of the 1. 8 million tons reaped last year . Production of millet was expected to drop from 300 , 000 to 250 , 000 tons . The wheat harvest , the victim of the worst shortage of river water in more than 70 years , is expected to be cut from about 160 , 000 tons to 15 , 000. // The drought has caused people to flee the worst-hit areas , driving tens of thousands of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 50 , 000 , by some estimates , have camped on the periphery of Omdurman , a city on the Nile a short drive from the capital , Khartoum. // According to William R. Smyser , the United Nations deputy high commissioner for refugees , who arrived in the Sudan from Geneva to assess the situation , problems in the camps , including water and food shortages and inadequate health care , were being immediately addressed . He said that measles vaccine brought in recently had diminished the epidemic . The primary medical problems arise not after the people arrive in refugee camps but are a result of the trip to get there , he said. // //
