txt It has God knows how many pre-sold viewers , not only those who saw and loved the first movie , but those who 've been sleeping on Star Wars sheets , eating their Twinkies on Star Wars plates and playing with models of C-3P0 and R2-D2 . It has a media blitz to entice countless others , ranging from a cover story in Time to a toll-free number-800 plus 5/21/ 1980 , that Is , its opening date which when dialed puts you in touch with Han Solo , Leia , etc . Can " The Empire Strikes Back " possibly miss ? certainly not as a blockbuster business venture . As blockbuster entertainment ? well , that 's something else again . For in answer to the question you 've been waiting for with baited breath since 8/21/1977 ? no , this time out , the " Star Wars " enterprise is n't anywhere as enjoyable as the onginal . This is not to say the movie 's special effects are n't breathtaking . As mounted by a On Film " The Empire Strikes Back " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and by " Star Wars " creator George Lucas , who now serves as executive producer , these effects are more breathtaking than ever . Among other dazzling sequences : a flight through an asteroid field that seems to take place in threedimension . Among other exquisitely constructed figures : the newly introduced Yoda , an 800-year-old guru gnome who teaches the Jedi way and who has been so finely put together by Frank Oz as to make us wonder continually if he is n't real . Nor is one inclined to complain of the movie 's plot . Though " Empire " confusingly starts in the middle of things ( and indeed , ends there as well ) , leaps about with a speed and jerkiness to further confound and tells a tale hardly noteworthy for its logic and significance , all this was true to a great extent of the original . And while one can . I suppose , blame an absence of freshness for its lack of power , this too hardly seems crucial . After all , it 's precisely because they want more of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the first place , greeting the appearance of all their old friends with delight . Rather , it 's that the tone of the movie has changed , having become darker , more ominous , less frankly silly . The look of the movie itself makes the point , with sequence after sequence serving up images drawn more from ugly nightmare than from pleasant daydream . A grotesque monster surprises our hero land us ) on the ice planet where , at the movie 's outset , he and his pals are hiding . One sees primevally temfying dinosaur-like tanks with which the Imperial forces fight their first battle . There is the shadowy , swampish atmosphere of the Dagobah planet , where the gargoyle-faced Yoda lives among muck and snakes and where Luke Skywalker takes his all-important Jedi training ( a project with which the movie spends a good deal of time ) . Even Yoda himself adds to this effect . For if he is the new film 's most interesting creation , he is also much less cute and comical than those we met before , owing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cartoons that inspired them than to ancient myth , primitive religion , even Tolkien . As spiritual mentor , Yoda is key to the new thrust of the sequel 's materials . Concentrating less on simplistic external conflicts , " Empire " focuses more on what purports to be a complex internal struggle  --  the moral dilemma of Luke Skywalker who is torn between the ennobling good represented by Yoda and the corrupting evil embodied by Darth Vader . Central as he is to the movie 's new psychological emphasis , Darth Vader himself emerges a much more imposing presence this time , throwing his black and brooding shadow over the whole . Of course one might argue that all this represents a gain , adding to the original , sophistication , nchness , depth . But truth to tell , these developments seem little more than inappropriate . To place internal struggles within one-dimensional characters who by definition have no interior is absurd ; just as it also seems misguided to take such frothy stuff as the " Star Wars " saga and attempt to give it substance and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much time reading their own publicity ? discovering the Homeric resonance of their movie , its deep cultural and psychological significance . Perhaps , too , they 've simply been overwhelmed by success . But whatever , they have clearly begun to take themselves and their movie too seriously . In so doing they have given us a " Star Wars " that has not only lost much of its humor and charm but more important a good deal of its innocence , traveling in the process light years away from the shiny first magnitude of its original world .
