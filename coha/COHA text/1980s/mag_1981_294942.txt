It was the one that truly mattered as America said " welcome home " <P> " We are not really heroes . We work for the Government and just did our job . " <P> - Former Hostage Sergeant Joseph Subic , U.S.A. <P> Perhaps . But Americans , weary of bickering and division , had been looking eagerly for heroes who could inspire a healing outburst of spontaneous affection and patriotism . <P> And if the heroes turned out to be a band of 52 people who had withstood an ordeal that they had not sought , who seemed as puzzled as they were delighted by their sudden glory , and who preached no message except love of family , home and country ? Well , so much the better : here at last were men and women who could be admired without reservation . <P> So the nation last week welcomed the freed hostages back from their 444 days of captivity with an orgy of emotion . Yellow ribbons were tied to virtually everything that could not or would not resist : trees , lampposts , TV @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hostages ' homes and public buildings , including the White House . Parades wound through Washington , New York City , Detroit , Milwaukee , San Diego and Columbia , S.C . Others will follow this week , in cities and towns where former hostages make their homes . <P> Inevitably , there were a few incidents of tasteless exploitation . A San Francisco executive of a supermarket chain suggested to store managers that they tie yellow bows around household plants , boost the price by $1.50 each , and tout them as mementos of the national celebration . At times too , the national euphoria passed the bounds of reason . Hand-lettered sign after sign along the parade routes proclaimed U.S. 52 , IRAN 0 , as if the release of the hostages represented an overwhelming American victory rather than what it was : the negotiated end to a prolonged national nightmare . <P> But for the most part , the coast-to-coast celebration was an outpouring of innocent joy . Said Lois Layton , who drove from Norfolk , Va. , to stand in a crowd of some 400,000 watching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reagan 's welcoming ceremony at the White House : " It 's like a release to me . I could n't go to Iran and fight , but I can come here and scream . " Said Norma Rose of Silver Spring , Md. : " I felt the suffering . Now , I feel part of the miracle of their freedom . It 's what we needed desperately to bring our country together again . " Trying to build on this new sense of national unity , President Reagan urged the ex-hostages and , by implication , the nation not to dwell on the past , but to " turn the page and look ahead . " <P> <P> The Government was already looking ahead , seeking answers to difficult and even dangerous questions stemming from the Iran experience . The most important : What will the U.S. do if terrorists , emboldened by Iran 's example , seize another group of American hostages ? At the White House ceremony , a momentarily grim Reagan answered : " Let terrorists be aware that when the rules of international behavior are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effective retribution . " The freed hostages led a crowd of 6,000 in applause .
