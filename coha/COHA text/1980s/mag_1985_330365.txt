The Yakima Valley of southern Washington is 1,000 miles from the Mexican border . But so many former migrants have settled there after coming north to $ pick the valley 's apples , pears and cherries that no one thought it odd when the governor of the Mexican state of Michoacan made a speech to them last spring over the local Spanish-language radio station . The governor , or so went the local joke , was only trying to stay in touch with his constituents . <P> Union City , N.J. , is 1,300 miles from Cuba . But refugees from Fidel Castro 's island so dominate the community that a service organization posts the days when the " Cuban Lions " meet . A children 's shop does a brisk business in mosquiteros , lace mosquito nets for cribs that are a necessity in Cuba but only a nostalgic and expensive decoration in Union City . <P> Chicago is far from any entry point for Hispanics into the U.S. But it has drawn such a diverse Latin population that the Spanish language alone is no guide as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Says Dem ocratic Ward Committeeman Jesus Garcia : " You can tell where you are from the sounds and the smell of the cooking . In Mexican areas people are doing the taco thing with beans and rice ; in Puerto Rican areas it 's roast pork and fried rice . If you walk around Pilsen ( a Mexican enclave ) you 'll hear mariachi music ; in ( Puerto Rican ) Humboldt Park you 'll hear salsa and conga drums . " <P> An Anglo 's nose and ears , to be sure , might be unable to tell the difference today . But that is likely to change . Already the growth of the U.S. Hispanic population is one of the most startling phenomena in American social history , and if anything it is likely to speed up . <P> As recently as 1950 , the census counted fewer than 4 million residents on the U.S. mainland who would today fall under the category Hispanic , the majority of Mexican descent . Last year there were an estimated 17.6 million , with roughly 60% tracing their ancestry to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ El Salvador , the Dominican Republic , Colombia , Venezuela and about two dozen other countries of Central and South America . Fully two-thirds were immigrants , according to a study by Yankelovich , Skelly &; White Inc. , a New York market-research and polling firm , that was commissioned by the SIN Television Network , a national grouping of Spanish-language stations. * Some 24% had entered during the previous ten years alone . These figures are open to argument , since they include Puerto Ricans on the mainland , who legally are not immigrants but citizens from birth . Even so , never before has the U.S. absorbed so many newcomers speaking the same foreign language . <P> &lt; Shortly after World War II , three-quarters of all Hispanics on the U.S. mainland lived in Texas or California . As of 1980 , those two states still accounted for 51% of the total Hispanic population . But large numbers have also settled in Arizona ( 16% Hispanic ) and New Mexico ( 36% ) and in such inland and Northern <P> cities as Denver ( 19% ) and Hartford , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a million Hispanics ( 78% Cuban ) have spread so rapidly beyond Miami ( 64% Hispanic ) that they sometimes refer to the entire 25-mile-or-so stretch from Miami to the Everglades as Calle Ocho ( Eighth Street ) , after the main drag of Miami 's Little Havana .
