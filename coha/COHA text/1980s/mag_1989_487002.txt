You smell sulfur ? that rotten egg smell ? " asks Kim Folse . " That 's an oil well blowing off somewhere in the gulf . " For natives like Folse of Morgan City , a tiny petroleum and shrimping town ninety miles southwest of New Orleans , where unemployment hit 27 percent a few years back , any whiff of oil activity is welcome . But other smells are not so enthusiastically received . Chlorine fumes and odors of ammonia , paint thinner , creosote and pesticide have regularly sent citizens racing to file complaints with the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality ( D.E.Q. ) . The source of the fumes , and of occasional black , orange , blue and yellow smoke , is Marine Shale Processors , located eight miles east of Morgan City . The nation 's largest hazardous waste incinerator , M.S.P. burns 100,000 tons of toxic waste each year . Now , after almost five years of virtually unregulated operation , M.S.P. is in trouble  --  with the courts , with state and Federal environmental authorities and most of all with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forces move to shut it down , M.S.P. continues to burn . Its story presents a case study of the power of money and political influence endangering the health of a community while civic watchdogs either doze or tie themselves up in legal and bureaucratic knots . In this oil patch of Cajun country , as oil prices continued to plunge , bankruptcy spread like kudzu and residents moved out of state at a rate of 85,000 a year . M.S.P. became the second-fastest-growing company in Louisiana . Its customer rolls swelled from fifty-two in 1986 to more than 3,000 in 1988 . Its gross revenues , with an astounding profit margin of 25 to 40 percent , shot from $5.5 million in 1986 to $39 million in 1988 . State and local officials looked benignly upon the company , which provided jobs for 325 people and charity for forty civic groups , donating uniforms to the school band and holiday turkeys to the needy . But some citizens saw things differently . Despite the apparent economic benefit , the issue , says lifelong resident Monica Mancuso , was whether " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kent , the founder of Marine Shale , is a master at manipulating power . At the end of 1984 , having made and lost one lot Lune in one oil industry , he approached his friend Governor Edwin Edwards , to whose re-election campaign he had donated at least $75,000 . With the help of Edwards Carol Strickland , a native of New Orleans , writes frequently on Louisiana politics . and one of his lackeys , another friend who drew up the necessary legislative proposal , Kent hoped to gain a monopoly on the disposal of spent oil-drilling mud . That legislation was still pending in January 1985 , but Kent received state and parish permits to incinerate these relatively nonhazardous oil wastes at his new company . When the mighty oil and gas lobby finally defeated Edwards 's proposal , Kent found himself with a kiln but no customers . Ever resourceful , he turned to toxic waste disposal , in violation of his permit ? a fact discovered when a fire at the plant brought a surprise visit by D.E.Q. inspectors . Kent then took a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he asked the D.E.Q. for permission to burn material from local abandoned hazardous waste pits as fuel in order to manufacture a product  --  vitrified combustion ash  --  which he planned to sell to construction companies for landfill and road building projects . He said that because of his " revolutionary " methods , the ash would be completely safe ; and indeed M.S.P. once delivered a load of processed ash to a local playground . " He presented it as a mom and apple pie kind of operation to help us get rid of a significant environmental problem , " says Patricia Norton , Secretary of the D.E.Q. at the time . " It sounded almost too good to be true , and in retrospect , it was . " After Norton , under intense pressure from Governor Edwards , granted M.S.P. a permit to dispose of creosote , which when burned can release dioxin , Kent immediately began to take a wide variety of hazardous wastes from all over the country . " Had I known what Mr. Kent intended to do with the facility , I would never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is no doubt the permit was fraudulently obtained " Jack Kent , 49 , a plain-spoken man with the complexion of a boiled lobster , is blunt about his plant 's early operation . " It was pretty much of a trial and error type situation .. . from day one , " he says . Willie Fontenot , environmental specialist in the Louisiana Attorney General 's office , visited M.S.P. before the company incinerated its first load : " The manager said , ' This is a top-notch , state-of-the-art facility . ' They said they had super-duper air bags which would never blow out . Two weeks later they fired up and very shortly thereafter their air bag blew and they had black smoke all over the place . " Parish Councilman Bob McHugh recalls the day the plant spewed a thick plume of black smoke that was visible for ten miles . " It was suffocating . I can remember Jack Kent 's words : ' I know the damn thing 's not right . I do n't blame the people for complaining . ' But he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had written regulations and made policy recommendations applying to M.S.P. began to leave state employ and , with unseemly haste , join Kent 's payroll . Still , in its first year the company was cited frequently by D.E.Q. for operating violations . " When they opened up , they had no one ? I mean no one ? trained in the handling of hazardous waste , " says McHugh . " There were accidents on top of accidents , one fire after another . " Reeking creosote fumes , coupled with skin and eye irritations , drove nearby businesses to evacuate . " You 'd barf if you came near their old blending barges , " says an inspector with the Environmental Protection Agency ( which eventually got into the act ) , and , indeed , a number of visiting journalists have vomited in reaction to the fumes billowing out when workers open barrels of waste . " It 's the worst part of the operation , " the inspector says . " They stir up volatile organics with a backhoe . I personally would n't want to even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respirator . " The D.E.Q. issued cleanup orders , but M.S.P. refused to comply . Instead , in 1986 Kent sought formally to classify M.S.P. as a recycling facility . That designation places a company under regulations even more relaxed than those governing incinerators , exempting it from costly and time-consuming procedures for disposing of incinerator ash and thereby giving it a privileged position in the marketplace . As a " recycler , " M.S.P. would be able to undercut its competitors ' prices by 60 percent . Fontenot remembers advising Norton to refer the case to the Attorney General , " because the people involved were close to the Governor , and Edwin Edwards likes to help his friends . " But Norton capitulated to political arm-twisting and approved M.S.P. 's classification as a recycler without holding full hearings . Inspectors in her department continued to document incidents of " environmental degradation , " while M.S.P. employees suffered chemical burns , temporary loss of sight , collapsed lungs and bronchitis caused by exposure to dangerous gases . At a citizens ' meeting Deborah Mabile spoke of her husband , Douglas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form and could n't discuss company activities : " He was making $6.50 an hour , which is pretty good when you 've been unemployed . But when he came home , every nerve twitched like he 'd been exposed to pesticides . And he had a full face mask on . . . . If there 's nothing harmful in there , why in the hell did my husband come home looking like he was sprayed with bug spray ? " Marine Shale , 10 percent of whose employees are influential lawyers , public relations pros and technical consultants , managed to appeal and rescind every D.E.Q. compliance order . In exasperation Norton , who would soon be fired by Edwards for being too " environmental , " turned the case over to the E.P.A . for enforcement . " I thought the E.P.A . was ready to move and would close it down in twenty-four hours , " Norton says . " Not only did the company not do what they promised , but the Federal government did n't do what they said they 'd do either . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ armed with criminal search warrants to seize M.S.P. records in November 1986 ( and in a second raid in June 1988 ) , for two and a half years almost nothing happened . A hush-hush grand jury probe investigated , under organized crime statutes , issues of public corruption , influence peddling and environmental crime . But all that time M.S.P. kept burning mercury , DDT , cyanide and deadly dioxin-containing wastes from thousands of companies throughout the country , and even from two toxic waste sites under E.P.A . supervision . And in Washington , Trent Lott of Mississippi , then the House minority whip , wrote to E.P.A . Administrator Lee Thomas urging the agency to stop its " harassment " of Lott 's " very close friend " Jack Kent . In February 1988 the D.E.Q. issued a list of water quality violations and warned of " accidents waiting to happen . " " Baghouse " dust , stored in uncovered piles , containing high concentrations of lead , cadmium and other extremely toxic pollutants , was later found blowing freely about the site . Mike McDaniel , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that every year forty tons of uncontrolled , unfiltered and unpermitted emissions escaped unintentionally from the M.S.P. plant . For more than two years wastes were also stored in leaking , listing open barges on Bayou Boeuf adjacent to the plant , contaminating the bayou with polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons ( among the most dangerous known carcinogens and mutagens ) as well as high levels of cadmium , chromium and mercury . A drinking water intake is located in the bayou one-half mile from the plant . Yet because the E.P.A . had primary jurisdiction , the D.E.Q. was helpless to fine or force improvements . That 's when Morgan City residents came in . Forming South Louisiana Against Pollution ( SLAP ) , they threatened to sue M.S.P. But , again , because the E.P.A . discourages parallel civil proceedings while a Federal investigation is under way , the suit was never pursued . Citizen protest escalated , however , when five children within a period of eighteen months were diagnosed as having neuroblastoma , a fatal cancer of the nervous system . Neuroblastoma typically occurs in one child in 100,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cases among 64,000 inhabitants . Two of the children died , spurring people across the parish to organize , lobby their legislators and denounce M.S.P. as a threat to public health . In addition to the cancers , they cited increases in respiratory problems , congenital birth defects , miscarriages and stillbirths among people living near the plant . Because carcinogens leave no calling card , M.S.P. spokesmen can say there is no medical evidence linking their operation to the cancer cases . Also , Louisiana has one of the highest cancer mortality rates in the country . Producing one-quarter of the nation 's chemicals , the eighty-mile strip of industrial wasteland between Baton Rouge and New Orleans is known as Cancer Alley . But those opposed to M.S.P. note the significantly higher rates of cancer clustered around incinerator sites elsewhere in the nation , as in Calvert City , Kentucky , and El Dorado , Arkansas . They also point to some disturbing parallels . SLAP member Melanie O'Neill says that in McFarland , California ( population 6,000 ) , twelve children in a six-block area contracted cancer , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In 1987 M.S.P. burned train-car loads of soil contaminated with dinoseb from that same area in California , at a time when the plant 's bags for trapping harmful emissions had severely decomposed . Things began to look brighter to people like O'Neill when Buddy Roemer , a reform candidate who strictly limited campaign contributions , became Governor and reversed his predecessor 's " keep off the grass if you want to " approach to environmental quality . The D.E.Q. decided to pursue Marine Shale apart from the E.P.A . Roemer backed a bill that would nix the company 's classification as a recycler and force it to apply for a new permit , putting it out of business for at least three years and possibly forever . The bill died in Senate committee ? Senator Ben Bagert , the only committee member who voted for the bill , says , " Somebody was trying to stack the deck " ? so Roemer 's people reworked it . While forfeiting reclassification , they did gain the right to tougher regulation . In an abrupt shift from past tolerance , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and water quality violations , citing " a high degree of recalcitrance , defiance , and indifference to regulations . . . reflective of a pattern of repeated non-compliance . " In Louisiana , however , proposed penalties are far from imposed penalties . M.S.P. , which has appealed the fines , can delay settlement through litigation and reduce levies through dickering , euphemistically known as " compromise . " In the case of another company , for example , the D.E.Q. set an air quality violation fine of $66,000 ; it collected $17,000 . Marine Shale has cleaned up a bit since the days when black clouds of unburned creosote descended like an incubus on Morgan City . Yet a trial burn conducted last November indicated dangerous emissions of nitrogen oxides , particulates , sulfur dioxide , hydrogen chloride , hydrocarbons , heavy metals , dioxins and furans . And last May the D.E.Q. caught the company red-handed in two violations ; illegally receiving hazardous wastes from a foreign country ( Canada ) and producing and selling ash that registered dangerous levels of lead and other heavy metals . State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's permits . In July the grand jury 's deliberations were concluded when M.S.P. , whose slogan is " Let 's Clean Up America , " pleaded guilty to criminal violations of Federal hazardous waste laws and misdemeanor violations of Federal water pollution control laws . Under the terms of a plea bargain reached with the Justice Department , the company agreed to pay a fine of $1 million , admitting its culpability in storing creosote wastes in an open pile , contaminating the bayou and sinking a barge used as a storage vessel for hazardous wastes in the intracoastal waterway . The penalty represents the E.P.A . ' s first major enforcement action against M.S.P. , and the agency 's spokesmen , declaring " Never again , " promise more stringent Federal regulations to close the recycler loophole . ( Whether the ash will be exempt from regulation remains unclear . ) Meanwhile , M.S.P. customers have become skittish , fearing potential liability for site cleanup . " It 's unbelievable something like this can happen to you in this country , " says Jack Kent , who insists that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the incineration behemoth Rollins Environmental Services . " You hear about stuff like this in Nicaragua , but to have a company that 's so powerful they can crank up investigations , you would n't think that could happen in America . " But Jack Kent and the " trial and error " company that 's made him millions tell a real American story . He began his venture with trickery and some well-placed favors , tools that would be on hand as , for years , he evaded the law , pocketed public guardians and poisoned a community . Now that this spree appears to be corning to an end , the laws he was able to manipulate remain in place . He has yet to pay a cent in penalties to the State of Louisiana . And every day that the appeals process continues , Marine Shale Processors goes on burning anything it pleases . " The wheels of justice grind slowly , " Willie Fontenot in the Attorney General 's office said , reviewing the record optimistically . " But they do grind . " ?  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
