Seven weeks after the end of the Falklands War the islands ' 1,800 " kelpers " are trying to return to the quiet life they enjoyed before Argentina 's invasion . But not everything is as it was , largely because the 40-man force that had previously defended the islands has been replaced by a 3,000-man British garrison . On their time off , the soldiers have little to do but socialize and spend money in the small local shops , buying up Port Stanley 's supply of postcards and objects carrying the Falklands ' motto , " Desire the Right . " One storeowner has already sold out a supply of watches and jewelry that would previously have lasted half a year . Meanwhile , Britain announced it would relax the 200-mile " total exclusion zone " imposed at the height of the Falklands crisis . But Britain , still wary of Argentina 's intentions , asked that country 's military ships and aircraft to stay 150 miles away .                  @ @ @
