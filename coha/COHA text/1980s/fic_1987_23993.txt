S T 0 R Y SORRY FUGU By T. Coraghessan Boyle imp radicchio . " " Sorry fugu . " " A blasphemy of baby lamb 's lettuce , frisee , endive . " " A coulibiac made in hell . " For six months he knew her only by her byline  --  Willa Frank  --  and by the sting of her adjectives , the derisive thrust of her metaphors , the cold precision of her substantives . Regardless of the dish , despite the sincerity and ingenuity of the chef and the freshness or rarity of the ingredients , she seemed always to find it wanting . " The duck had been reduced to the state of the residue one might expect to find in the nether depths of a funerary urn " ; " For all its rather testy piquancy , the orange sauce might just as well have been citron preserved in pickling brine " ; " Paste and pasta . Are they synonymous ? Hardly . But one would n't have known the difference at Udolpho 's . The fresh ' angel hair had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quailed before those caustic pronouncements , he shuddered and blanched and felt his stomach drop like a croquette into a vat of hot grease . On the morning she skewered Udolpho 's , he was sitting over a cup of reheated espresso and nibbling at a wedge of hazelnut dacquoise that had survived the previous night 's T. Coragbessan Boyle 's new novel , World 's End , will be published this month by Viking . crush . As was his habit on Fridays , he 'd retrieved the paper from the front mat , got himself a bite , and then , with the reckless abandon of a diver plunging into an icy lake , turned to the " Dining Out " column . On alternate weeks , Willa Frank yielded to the paper 's other regular reviewer , a big-hearted , appreciative woman by the name of Leonora Merganser , who approached every restaurant like a mother of eight feted by her children on Mother 's Day , and whose praise gushed forth in a breathless salivating stream that washed the reader out of his chair and up against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a reservation . But this was Willa Frank 's week . And Willa Frank never liked anything . With trembling fingers  --  it was only a matter of time before she slipped like a spy , like a murderess , into D'Angelo 's and filleted him like all the others  --  he smoothed out the paper and focused on the bold black letters of the headline : UDOLPHO 'S : TROGLODYTIC CUISINE IN A CAVE-LIKE ATMOSPHERE He read on , heart in mouth . She 'd visited the restaurant on three occasions , once m the company of an abstract artist from Detroit , and twice with her regular companion , a young man so discerning she referred to him only as " The Palate . " On all three occasions , she 'd been sniff  --  disappointed . The turn-of-the-century gas lamps Udolpho 's grandfather had brought over from Naples had n't appealed to her ( " so dark we joked that it was like dining among Neanderthals in the sub-basement of their cave " ) , nor had the open fire in the massive stone fireplace that dominated the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ) . And then there was the food . When Albert got to the line about the pasta , he could n't go on . He folded the paper as carefully as he might have folded the winding-sheet over Udolpho 's broken body and set it aside . It was then that Marie stepped through the swinging doors to the kitchen , the wet cloth napkin she 'd been using as a dishrag clutched in her hand . " Albert ? " she gasped , darting an uneasy glance from his stricken face to the newspaper . " Is anything wrong ? Did she --  ? Today ? " She assumed the worst , and now he corrected her in a drawl so lugubrious it might have been his expiring breath : " Udolpho 's . " " Udolpho 's ? " Relief flooded her voice , but almost immediately it gave way to disbelief and outrage . " Udolpho 's ? " she repeated . He shook his head sadly . For thirty years Udolpho 's had reigned supreme among West Side restaurants , a place impervious to fads and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way no nouvelle mangerie with its pastel walls and Breuer chairs could ever hope to be . Cagney had eaten here , Durante , Roy Rogers , Anna Maria Alberghetti . It was a shrine , an institution . Albert himself , a pudgy sorrowful boy of twelve , ridiculed for his flab and the great insatiable fist of his appetite , had experienced the grand epiphany of his life in one of Udolpho 's dark , smoky , and  --  for him , at least  --  forever exotic banquettes . Sampling the vermicelli with oil , garlic , olives , and forest mushrooms , the ossu buco with the little twists of bow tie pasta that drank up its buttery juices , he knew , just as certainly as Alexander must have known he was born to conquer , that he , Albert D'Angelo , was born to eat . And that far from being something to be ashamed of , it was glorious , avocation and vocation both , the highest pinnacle to which he could aspire . Other boys had their Snider , their Mays , their Reese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were Pellaprat , Escoffier , Udolpho Melanzane . Yes . And now Udolpho was nothing . Willa Frank had seen to that . Marie was bent over the table now , reading , her piping girlish voice hot with indignation . " Where does she come off , anyway ? " Albert shrugged . Since he 'd opened D'Angelo 's eighteen months ago the press had all but ignored him . Yes , he 'd had a little paragraph in Barbed Wire , the alternative press weekly handed out on street corners by greasy characterswith straight pins through their noses , but you could hardly count that . There was only one paper that really mattered  --  Willa Frank 's paper  --  and while word of mouth was all right , without a review in the paper , you were dead . Problem was , if Willa Frank wrote you up , you were dead anyway . " Maybe you 'll get the other one , " Marie said suddenly . " What 's her name  --  the good one . " Albert 's lips barely moved . " Leonora Mer-ganser @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I want Willa Frank , " he growled . Marie 's brow lifted . She closed the paper and came to him , rocked back from his belly and pecked a kiss to his beard . " You ca n't be serious ? " Albert glanced bitterly around the restaurant , the simple pine tables , whitewashed walls , potted palms soft in the filtered morning light . " Leonora Merganser would faint over the Hamburger Hamlet on the corner , Long John Silver 's , anything . Where 's the challenge in that ? " " Challenge ? But we do n't want a challenge , honey  --  we want business . Do n't we ? I mean , if we 're going to get married and all ? " Albert sat heavily , took a miserable sip of his stone-cold espresso . " I 'm a great chef , are n't 1 ? " There was something in his tone that told her it was n't exactly a rhetorical question . " Honey , baby , " she was in his lap now , fluffing his hair , peering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The best . The very best . But ? " " Willa Frank , " he rumbled . " Willa Frank . 1 want her . " here are nights when it all comes together , when the monkfish is so fresh it flakes on the grill , when the pesto tastes like the wind through the pines and the party of eight gets their seven appetizers and six entrees in palettes of rising steam and delicate color so perfect they might have been a single diner sitting down to a single dish . This night , however , was nor such a night . This was a night when everything went wrong . First of all , there was the aggravating fact that Eduardo  --  the Chilean waiter who 'd learned , a la Chico Marx , to sprinkle superfluous " ohs " through his speech and thus pass for Italian  --  was late . This put Marie off her pace vis-a-vis the desserts , for which she was solely responsible , since she had to seat and serve the first half dozen customers . Next , in rapid succession @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the grill , sun-dried tomatoes for the fusilli with funghi , capers , black olives arid , yes , sun-dried tomatoes , and that the fresh cream for the frittata piemontese had mysteriously gone sour . And then , just when he 'd managed to recover his equilibrium and was working in that translated state where mind and body are one , Roque went berserk . Of the restaurant 's five employees  --  Marie , Eduardo , Torrey , who did day-cleanup , Albert himself , and Roque  --  Roque operated on perhaps the most elemental level . He was the dishwasher , The Yucatano dishwasher . Whose responsibility it was to see that D'Angelo 's pink and gray sets of heavy Syracuse china were kept in constant circulation through the mid-evening dinner rush . On this particular night , however , Roque was slow to accept the challenge of that responsibility , scraping plates and wielding the nozzle of his supersprayer as if in a dream . And not only was he moving slowly , the dishes , with their spatters of red and white sauce and dribbles of grease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was muttering to himself . Darkly . In a dialect so arcane even Eduardo could n't fathom it . When Albert questioned him  --  a bit too sharply , perhaps : he was overwrought himself ? Roque exploded . All Albert had said was , " Roque  --  you all right ? " but he might just as well have reviled his mother , his fourteen sisters , and his birthplace . Cursing , Roque danced back from the stainless steel sink , tore the apron from his chest , and began scaling dishes against the wall . It took all of Albert 's 220 pounds , together with Eduardo 's 180 , to get Roque , who could n't have weighed more than 120 in hip boots , out the door and into the alley . Together they slammed the door on him  --  the door on which he continued to beat with a shoe for half an hour or more  --  while Marie took up the dishrag with a sigh . A disaster . Pure , unalloyed , unmitigated . The night was a disaster . Albert had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alley door and into the kitchen , her bony hand raised in greeting . Torrey was pale and shrunken , a nineteen year old with a red butch cut who spoke with the rising inflection and oblate vowels of the Valley Girl , born and bred . She wanted an advance on her salary . " Momento , momenta , " Albert said , flashing past her with a pan of b  --  arnaise in one hand , a mayonnaise jar of vivid orange sea-urchin roe in the other . He liked to use his rudimentary Italian when he was cooking . It made him feel impregnable . Meanwhile , Torrey shuffled halfheartedly across the floor and positioned herself behind the porthole in the " out " door , where , for lack of anything better to do , she could watch the customers eat , drink , smoke , and finger their pastry . The b  --  arnaise was puddling up beautifully on a plate of grilled baby summer squash , theroe dolloped on a fillet of monkfish nestled snug in its cruet , and Albert was thinking of offering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when she let out a low whistle . This was no cab or encore whistle , but the sort of whistle that expresses surprise or shock  --  a " Holy Cow ! " sort of whistle . It stopped Albert cold . Something bad was about to happen , he knew it , just as surely as he knew that the tiny hairs rimming his bald spot had suddenly stiffened up like hackles . " What ? " he demanded . " What is it ? " Torrey turned to him , slow as an executioner . " I see you got Willa Frank out there tonight  --  everything going okay ? " The monkfish burst into flame , the bearnaise turned to water , Marie dropped two cups of coffee and a plate of homemade millefoglie . No matter . In an instant , all three of them were pressed up against the little round window , as intent as torpedoers peering through a periscope . " Which one ? " Albert hissed , his heart doing paradiddles . " Over there ? " Torrey said , making it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The one with the blonde wig ? " Albert looked , but he could n't see . " Where ? Where ? " he cried . " There ? In the corner ? " In the corner , in the corner . Albert was looking at a young woman , a girl , a blonde in a black cocktail dress and no brassiere , seated across from a hulking giant with a peroxide-streaked flattop . " Where ? " he repeated . Torrey pointed . " The blonde ? " He could feel Marie go slack beside him . " But that ca n't be ? " Words failed him . This was Willa Frank , doyenne of taste , grande dame of haute cuisine , ferreter out of the incorrect , the underachieved , and the unfortunate ? And this clod beside her , with the great smooth-working jaw and forearms like pillars , this was the possessor of the fussiest , pickiest , most sophisticated and fastidious palate in town ? No , it was impossible . " Like I know him , you know ? " Torrey was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all that scene ? " But Albert was n't listening . He was watching her  --  Willa Frank  --  as transfixed as the tailor-bird that dares look into the cobra 's eye . She was slim , pretty , eyes dark as a houri 's , a lot of jewelry  --  not at all what he 'd expected . He 'd pictured a veiny elegant woman in her fifties , starchy , patrician , from Boston or Newport or some such place . But wait , wait : Eduardo was just setting the plates down  --  she was the Florentine tripe , of course  --  a good dish , a dish he 'd stand by any day , even a bad one like ... but the Palate , what was he having ? Albert strained forward , and he could feel Marie 's lost and limp hand feebly pressing his own . There : the veal piccata , yes , a very good dish , an outstanding dish . Yes . Yes . Eduardo bowed gracefully away . The big man in the punk hairdo bent to his plate and sniffed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut into the tripe , and raised the fork to her lips . he hated it . I know it . I know it . " Albert rocked back and forth in his chair , his face buried in his hands , the toque clinging to his brow like a carrion bird . It was past midnight , the restaurant was closed . He sat amidst the wreckage of the kitchen , the waste , the slop , the smell of congealed grease and dead spices , and his breath came in ragged sobbing gasps . Marie got up to rub the back of his neck . Sweet , honey-complected Marie , with her firm heavy arms and graceful wrists , the spill and generosity of her flesh  --  his consolation in a world of Willa Franks . " It 's okay , " she kept saying , over and over , her voice a soothing mur- ? mur , " it 's okay , it was good , it was . " He 'd failed , and he knew it . Of all nights , why this one ? Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when he was on , when the dishwasher was sober , the cream fresh , and the mesquite knots piled high against the wall , when he could concentrate , for christ 's sake ? " She did n't finish her tripe , " he said , disconsolate . " Or the grilled vegetables . I saw the plate . " " She 'll he back , " Marie said . " Three visits minimum , right ? " Albert fished out a handkerchief and sorrowfully blew his nose . " Yeah , " he said , " three strikes and you 're out . " He twisted his neck to look up at her . " The Palate , Jock , whatever the jerk 's name is , he did n't touch the veal . One bite maybe . Same with the pasta . Eduardo said the only thing he ate was the bread . And a bottle of beer . " " What does he know , " Marie said . " Or her either . " Albert shrugged . He pushed himself up wean-ly , impaled on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a glass of Orvieto and a plate of leftover sweetbreads . " Everything , " he said miserably , the meat like butter in his mouth , fragrant , nutty , inexpressibly right . He shrugged again . " Or nothing . What does it matter ? Either way we get screwed . " And ' Frank ' ? What kind of name is that , anyhow ? German ? Is that it ? " Marie was on the attack now , pacing the linoleum like a field marshall probing for a weakness in the enemy lines , looking for a way in . The Franks  --  were n't they those barbarians in high school that sacked Rome ? Or was it Paris ? " Willa Frank . The name was bitter on his tongue . Willa , Willa , Willa . It was a bony name , scant and lean , stripped of sensuality , the antithesis of the round , full-bodied Leonora . It spoke of a knotty Puritan toughness , a denying of the flesh , no compromise in the face of temptation . Willa . How could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That was even worse . A man 's name . Cold , forbidding , German , French . It was the name of a woman who would n't complicate her task with notions of charity or the sparing of feelings . No , it was the name of a woman who would wield her adjectives like a club . Stewing in these sour reflections , eating and no longer tasting , Albert was suddenly startled by a noise outside the alley door . He picked up a saucepan and stalked across the room  --  What next ? Were they planning to rob him now too , was that it I  --  and flung open the door . In the dim light of the alleyway stood two small dark men , the smaller of whom looked so much like Roque he might have been a clone . " Hello , " said the larger man , swiping a greasy Dodgers ' cap from his head , " I am called Raul , and this " ? indicating his companion ? " is called Fulgencio , cousin of Roque . " At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roque is gone to Albuquerque , " Raul continued , " and he is sorry . But he sends you his cousin , Fulgencio , to wash for you . " Albert stood back from the door , and Fulgencio , grinning and nodding , mimed the motion of washing a plate as he stepped into the kitchen . Still grinning , still miming , he samba-ed across the floor , lifted the supersprayer from its receptacle as he might have drawn a rapier from its scabbard , and started in on the dishes with a vigor that would have prostrated his mercurial cousin . For a long moment Albert merely stood there watching , barely conscious of Marie at his back and Raul 's parting gesture as he gently shut the door . All of a sudden he felt redeemed , reborn , capable of anything . There was Fulgencio , a total stranger not two minutes ago , washing dishesover the restaurant . Albert outdid himself , redefining the bounds of his nouvelle Northern Italian cuisine with a dozen new creations , including a very nice black pasta with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absolutely devastating meadowlark marinated in shallots , white wine , and mint . He worked like a man possessed , a man inspired . Each night he offered seven appetizers and six entrees , and each night they were different . He outdid himself , and outdid himself again . Friday came and went . The morning paper found Leonora Merganser puffing some Greek place in North Hollywood , heralding spanakopita as if it had been invented yesterday and discovering evidence of divine intervention in the folds of a grape leaf . Fulgencio scrubbed dishes with a passion , Eduardo worked on his accent and threw out his chest , Marie 's desserts positively floated on air . And day by day , Albert rose to new heights . It was on Tuesday of the following week  --  a quiet Tuesday , one of the quietest Albert could remember  --  that Willa Frank appeared again . There were only two other parties in the restaurant , a skeletal septuagenarian with a professorial air and his granddaughter  --  at least Albert hoped she was his granddaughter  --  and a Beverly Hills couple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place opened . Her presence was announced by Eduardo , who slammed into the kitchen with a drawn face and a shakily scrawled cocktail order . " She 's here , " he whispered , and the kitchen fell silent . Fulgencio paused , sprayer in hand . Marie looked up from a plate of tortes . Albert , who 'd been putting the finishing touches to a dish of sauteed scallops al pesto for the professor and a breast of duck with wild mushrooms for his granddaughter , staggered back from the table as if he 'd been shot . Dropping everything , he rushed to the porthole for a glimpse of her . It was his moment of truth , the moment in which his courage very nearly failed him . She was stunning . Glowing . As perfect and unapproachable as the plucked and haughty girls who looked out at him from the covers of magazines at the supermarket , icily elegant in a clingy silk chemise the color of b  --  chamel . How could he , Albert D'Angelo , for all his talent and greatness of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such perfection , to pique such jaded taste buds ? Wounded , he looked to her companions . Beside her , grinning hugely , as hearty , handsome , and bland as ever , was the Palate  --  he could expect no help from that quarter . And then he turned his eyes on the couple they 'd brought with them , looking for signs of sympathy . He looked in vain . They were middle-aged , silver-haired , dressed to the nines , thin and stringy in the way of those who exercise inflexible control over their appetites , about as sympathetic as vigilantes . Albert understood then that it was going to be an uphill battle . He turned back to the grill , girded himself in a clean apron , and awaited the worst . Marie fixed the drinks  --  two martinis , a Glenlivet neat for Willa , and a beer for the Palate . For appetizers they ordered mozzarella di bufala marinara , the caponata D'Angelo , the octopus salad , and the veal medallions with onion marmalade . Albert put his soul into each dish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care and shimmering inspiration of a Toulouse-Lautrec bent over a canvas , and watched , defeated , as each came back to the kitchen half-eaten . And then came the entrees . They ordered a selection  --  five different dishes  --  and Albert , after delivering them up to Eduardo with a face of stone , pressed himself to the porthole like a voyeur . Riveted , he watched as they sat back so that Eduardo could present the dishes . He waited , but nothing happened . They barely glanced at the food . And then , as if by signal , they began passing the plates around the table . He was stunned : what did they think this was  --  the Imperial Dinner at Chow Foo Luck 's ? But then he understood : each dish had to suffer the scrutiny of the big man with the brutal jaw before they would deign to touch it . No one ate , no one spoke , no one lifted a glass of the Chateau Bellegrave , 1966 , to his lips , until Jock had sniffed , finger-licked , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Willa sat rigid , her black eyes open wide , as the great-jawed , brush-headed giant leaned intently over the plate and rolled a bit of scallop or duck over his tongue . Finally , when all the dishes had circulated , the ecrevisses Alberto came to rest , like a roulette bail , in front of the Palate . But he 'd already busy , the place packed  --  but when Willa Frank and her Palate sauntered in at 9:1 5 , he was ready for them . They had reservations ( under an assumed name , of course M. Cavil , party of two ) , and Eduardo was able to seat them immediately . In he came , breathless , the familiar phrase like a tocsin on his lips ? " She 's here ! " ? and out he fluttered again , with the drinks : one Glenlivet neat , one beer . Albert never glanced up . On the stove , however , was a smallish pot . And in the pot were three tough scarred potatoes , eyes and dirt-flecked skin intact , boiling furiously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water , were the contents of a sixteen-ounce can of Mother Hubbard 's discount peas . Albert hummed to himself as he worked , searing chunks of grouper with shrimp , crab , and scallops in a big pan , chopping garlic and leeks , patting a scoop of foie Bras into place atop a tournedo of beef . When , some twenty minutes later , a still breathless Eduardo rocked through the door with their order , Albert took the yellow slip from him and tore it in two without giving it a second glance . Zero hour had arrived . " Marie ! " he called , " Marie , quick ! " He put on his most frantic face for her , the face of a man clutching at a wisp of grass at the very edge of a precipice . Marie went numb . She set down her cocktail shaker and wiped her hands on her apron . There was catastrophe in the air . " What is it ? " she gasped . He was out of sea-urchin roe . And fish fumet . And Willa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't a moment to lose  --  she had to rush over to the Edo Sushi House and borrow enough from Greg Takesue to last out the night . Albert had called ahead . It was okay . " Go , go , " he said , wringing his big pale hands . For the briefest moment , she hesitated . " But that 's all the way across town  --  if it takes me an hour , I 'll be lucky . " And now the matter-of-life-and-death look came into his eyes . " Go , " he said . " I 'll stall her . " No sooner had the door slammed behind Marie , than Albert took Fulgencio by the arm . " I want you to take a break , " he shouted over the hiss of the sprayer . " Forty-five minutes . No , an hour . " Fulgencio looked up at him out of the dark Aztecan slashes of his eyes . Then he broke into a broad grin . " No entiendo , " he said . Albert mimed it for him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flurry of nodding back and forth , Fulgencio was gone . Whistling ( " Core ' ngrato , " one of his late mother 's favorites ) , Albert glided to the meat locker and extracted the hard-frozen lump of gray gristle and fat he 'd purchased that afternoon at the local Safeway . Round steak , they called it , $2.39 a pound . He tore the thing from its plastic wrapping , selected his largest skillet , turned the heat up high beneath it , and unceremoniously dropped the frozen lump into the searing black depths of the pan . Eduardo hustled in and out , no time to question the twin absences of Marie and Fulgencio . Out went the tournedos Rossini , the fillet of grouper oursinade , the veal loin rubbed with sage and coriander , the anguille alla veneziana , and the zuppa di datteri Alberto ; in came the dirty plates , the congested forks , the wine glasses smeared with butter and lipstick . A great plume of smoke rose from the pan on the front burner . Albert went on whistling . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the kitchen , Albert caught him by the arm . " Here , " he said , shoving a plate into his hand . " For the gentleman with Miss Frank . And bring him another beer  --  on the house . " Eduardo stared bewildered at the plate in his hand . On it , arranged with all the finesse of a blue-plate special , lay three boiled potatoes , a splatter of reduced peas , and what could only be described as a plank of meat , stiff and flat as the chopping block , black as the bottom of the pan . " Trust me , " Albert said , guiding the stunned waiter toward the door . " Oh , and here , " thrusting a bottle of ketchup into his hand , " serve it with this . " Still , Albert did n't yield to the temptation to go to the porthole . Instead , he turned the flame down low beneath his saucepans , smoothed hack the hair at his temples , and began counting  --  as slowly as in a schoolyard game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Willa Frank , scintillating in a tomato-red Italian knit , burst through the door . Eduardo was right behind her , a martyred look on his face , his hands spread in supplication . Albert lifted his head , swelled his chest , and adjusted the great ball of his gut beneath the pristine field of his apron . He dismissed Eduardo with a flick of his hand , and turned to Willa Frank with the tight composed smile of a man running for office , " Excuse me , " she was saying , her voice toneless and shrill , as Eduardo ducked out the door , " but are you the chef here ? " He was still counting : twenty-eight , twenty-nine . 56 HARPERS MAGAZINE ; OCTOBER " Because I just wanted to tell you " ? she was so wrought up she could barely go on ? " 1 never , never in my life ... " " Shhhhh , " he said , pressing a finger to his lips . " It 's all right , " he murmured , his voice as soothing and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the elbow and led her to a table he 'd set up between the stove and chopping block . The table was draped with a snowy cloth , set with fine crystal , china , and sterling borrowed from his mother . There was a single chair , a single napkin . " Sit , " he said . She tore away from him . " I do n't want to sit , " she protested , her black eyes lit with suspicion . The knit dress clung to her like a leotard . Her heels clicked on the linoleum . " You know , do n't you ? " she said , hacking away from him . " You know who I am . " Huge , ursine , serene , Albert moved with her as if they were dancing . He nodded . " But why ? ? " He could see the appalling vision of that desecrated steak dancing before her eyes . It 's , it 's like suicide . " A saucepan had appeared in his hand . He was so close to her he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yielding cloth of his apron . " Hush , " he purred , " do n't think about it . Do n't think at all . Here , " he said , lifting the cover from the pan , " smell this . " She looked at him as if she did n't know where she was . She gazed down into the steaming pan and then looked hack up into his eyes . He saw the gentle , involuntary movement of her throat . " Squid rings in afoli sauce , " he whispered . " Try one . " Gently , never taking his eyes from her , he set the pan down on the table , plucked a ring from the sauce , and held it up before her face . Her lips  --  full , sensuous lips , he saw now , not at all the thin stingy flaps of skin he 'd imagined be-gan to tremble . Then she tilted her chin ever so slightly , and her mouth dropped open . He fed her like a nestling . First the squid : one , two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a thick , buttery saffron sauce . She practically licked the sauce from his fingers . This time , when he asked her to sit , when he put his big hand on her elbow and guided her forward , she obeyed . He glanced though the porthole and out into the dining room as he removed from the oven the little toast rounds with sun-dried tomatoes and baked Atascadero goat cheese . Jock 's head was down over his plate , the beer half-gone , a great wedge of incinerated meat impaled on the tines of his fork . His massive jaw was working , his cheek distended as if with a plug of tobacco . " Here , " Albert murmured , turning to Willa Frank and laying his warm , redolent hand overher eyes , " a surprise . " It was after she 'd finished the taglierini alla pizzaiola , with its homemade fennel sausage and chopped tomatoes , and was experiencing the first rush of his glace of grapefruit and Meyer lemon , that he asked about Jock . " Why him ? " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , licked a dollop of it from the comer of her mouth . " I do n't know , " she said , shrugging . " I guess I do n't trust my own taste , that 's all . " He lifted his eyebrows . He was leaning over her , solicitous , warm , the pan of Russian coulibiac of salmon , en brioche , with its rich sturgeon marrow and egg , held out in offering . She watched his hands as he whisked the ice away and replaced it with the gleaming coulibiac . " I mean , " she said , pausing as he broke off a morsel and fed it into her mouth , " half the time I just ca n't seem to taste anything , really , " chewing now , her lovely throat dipping and rising as she swallowed , " and Jock  --  well , he hates everything . At least I know he 'll be consistent . " She took another bite , paused , considered . " Besides , to like something , to really like it and come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I mean , what if I 'm wrong ? What if it 's really no good ? " Albert hovered over her . Outside it had begun to rain . He could hear it sizzling like grease in the alley . " Try this , " he said , setting a plate of spiedino before her . She was warm . He was warm . The oven glowed , the grill hissed , the scents of his creations rose about them , ambrosia and manna . " Um , good , " she said , unconsciously nibbling at prosciutto and mozzarella . " I do n't know , " she said after a moment , her fingers dark with anchovy sauce , " I guess that 's why I like fugu . " " Fugu ? " Albert had heard of it somewhere . " Japanese , is n't it ? " She nodded . " It 's a blowfish . They do it sushi or in little fried strips . But it 's the liver you want . It 's illegal here , did you know that ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Paralyze you . But if you just nibble , just a little bit , it numbs your lips , your teeth , your whole mouth . " " What do you mean  --  like at the dentist 's ? " Albert was horrified . Numbs your lips , your mouth ? It was sacrilege . " That 's awful , " he said . She looked sheepish , looked chastised . He swung to the stove and then back again , yet another pan in his hand . " Just a bite more , " he coaxed . She patted her stomach and gave him a great , wide , blooming smile . " Oh , no , no , Albert  --  can I call you Albert ? ? no , no , I could n't .
