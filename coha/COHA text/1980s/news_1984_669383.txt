The man who became prime minister when Lyndon Johnson was President of the United States , and Charles de Gaulle ruled France , drolly described his time in office : ' ' If you want to have one word to characterize the whole period , I would say that in these troubled times ' I survived , ' which is not bad for a politician. ' ' // Mr. Trudeau has no real plans for retirement . He and his three young sons will live in Montreal in an art-deco house on the side of a mountain . ' ' I can honestly say that my only resolve is to do nothing apart from the material occupation of moving from Ottawa to Montreal and finding schools for my kids , buying a new car , and hiring a maid and all those things , ' ' he said at a press conference. // He does not rule out some return to public life. // ' ' I would like not to involve myself either internationally or nationally for a good period of time so that when I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time - . . . I will be free to pick and choose among the best offers , if there are any coming. ' ' // After running Canada for almost all of the past 16 years , Trudeau ' s last days in office have been hectic - the economic summit in London and last-minute work on two of his favorite themes , bilingualism in Canada and world peace . Amid all this , his Liberal Party has been preparing to replace him . Tomorrow , the party convention will elect a leader who automatically becomes the new Canadian prime minister. // Last week at the London economic summit , President Reagan and Trudeau were reported to have exchanged strong words about peace at a private meeting . Trudeau ' s peace initiative has not been a success , and some officials in Ottawa grumble that one reason for that is American indifference to the plan . But after the summit last week , Mr. Trudeau said there was some hope for peace even if his plans for an East-West peace summit had not materialized. // ' ' Hopefully we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ don ' t want a war , either , ' ' he says. // Pierre Trudeau ' s last domestic political offensive was to ask the Province of Ontario to officially recognize the rights of its French-speaking citizens and become a fully bilingual province. // ' ' It would greatly strengthen the bonds of nationhood , ' ' the prime minister wrote in a letter to Ontario Premier William Davis . ' ' Its value for the Canadian spirit should not be underestimated. ' ' // The Ontario government has not given full language rights to its more than 500 , 000 French-speaking residents , although it has provided some services , notably French in the courts. // It was this issue of national unity that brought Pierre Trudeau to Ottawa in the first place when he was elected a member of Parliament in 1965 . His vision captivated Canadians . He was elected leader of the Liberal Party in the summer of 1968 and won a general election that same year . Those were the years of Trudeaumania , the prime minister as a matinee idol. // His political honeymoon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crisis of 1970 , in which a British diplomat was kidnapped in Montreal and a Quebec Cabinet minister was murdered by another terrorist gang seeking a separate Quebec . The prime minister won the approval of most Canadians for his cool handling of the crisis but was criticized by civil libertarians for invoking the War Measures Act , which temporarily removed many civil rights. // Mr. Trudeau ' s greatest success was the bringing home the Canadian Constitution , finally breaking the last official colonial ties with Britain . Although Canada has been fully independent from Britain for more than half a century - depending on which historian you ask - any changes to the British North America Act , as the Constitution was called , had to be made in London . The reason it had not been brought back earlier was constant squabbling among the 10 provinces . But on April 13 , 1982 , Pierre Trudeau gave Canadians their own Constitution along with a Charter of Rights . Historians say he will be remembered for this more than anything else. // His biggest failure has been the economy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percent , and Canada ' s economy has not picked up as quickly as its southern neighbor following the recession . His critics say that Trudeau ' s economic policies are to blame for Canada ' s woes. // The sluggish economy has certainly been a big factor in the prime minister ' s public unpopularity , one of the main reasons he decided to step down this year . But Trudeau and his government have been putting the blame on Ronald Reagan ' s policies and the spillover effect of high interest rates in the US. // ' ' If interest rates in the US go up , it will be impossible for Canadian lenders not to seek higher interest rates , and therefore interest rates will go up in Canada , ' ' he says. // Relations between Canada and the US - the two biggest trading partners in the world - have been cordial but never warm during the Trudeau years . The prime minister tried for a European trade connection to lessen Canada ' s dependence on the US , but geography proved stronger than ideas , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terms of trade . Any successor to Trudeau is expected to seek closer diplomatic and economic ties with the US. // The man who is the front-runner to succeed Trudeau is John Turner , a former finance minister who had a falling out with Trudeau over his economic policies in 1975 . In an election which could come this year , the new prime minister would be either Mr. Turner , assuming he wins tomorrow , or Brian Mulroney , the Conservative leader . Both are businessmen and will move the country to the right. // Trudeau was always happier in the world of ideas than in the world of finance . His administration has brought in many social programs. // ' ' Good , ' ' say his supporters , mainly in the Liberal Party . ' ' Bad , ' ' say his critics who complain that heavy government spending has wreaked havoc with the economy and is the main reason for the devaluation of the Canadian dollar. // Since John Turner left the Liberal government nine years ago , the Canadian dollar has fallen from $1. 03 in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trudeau ' s was that he strengthened the political power of the prime minister , which sits in the Langevin Block across Wellington Street from the House of Commons . His critics - especially the conservative MPs - say that in making the office so powerful , Trudeau made Parliament itself weaker and less effective. // //
