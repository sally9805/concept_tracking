 | A strike by 33,000 bus and subway drivers in early April plunged this financially troubled metropolis into another wrenching crisis . Frustration gripped New York City during the transit shutdown as more than 3 million commuters scrambled for other ways of getting around town . Confusion was compounded by a oneday strike against a railroad serving 95,000 rush-hour commuters from Long Island . Motorists encountered massive traffic jams . Other commuters used helicopters , boats , bicycles ? even roller skates . One man died walking across the Brooklyn Bridge . No other city in America depends so heavily on its buses and subways . The whole tempo of day-to-day life for millions is seemingly tied to the dense web of subway lines that crisscross Manhattan and the other boroughs . Deprived of those subways and buses , the wheels of commerce slowed down . Deputy Mayor Peter J. Solomon figured that for each day of the strike , New York 's economy suffered losses of up to 100 million dollars , including 2 million in much needed city tax revenues . A long strike , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recessionary hill . " Absenteeism plagued most businesses , causing a slump in retail sales and factory production . Unable to reach their workplaces , residents forfeited as much as 20 million dollars a day in wages . Tourism suffered as vacations and business trips to the city were canceled . The effect on the garment industry was called " catastrophic . " As bad as things were , most New Yorkers found ways to cope . The strike , beginning April 1 , prompted 500,000 commuters to take up temporary residence in Manhattan . They filled every hotel room in the city and crowded the bars . Some people slept in their offices . New York , which suffered through a similar transit strike in 1966 , seems accustomed to upheaval . Just five years ago , it narrowly escaped bankruptcy . " This ai n't any worse than the Depression , or Prohibition , or the blackout , or the first transit strike , " said ex-policeman Eddie Egan . Residents appeared to share Mayor Edward Koch 's view that the tax-subsidized Metropolitan Transit Authority should hold firm against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have to figure out how to live with the unthinkable , " said Koch , who faces a billion-dollar budget deficit in the next two years . One taxpayer advised : " Let them stay out ? we can do it . " Under these circumstances , the transit shutdown could be the beginning of a long siege of labor unrest for the nation 's largest city . Thousands more city workers may strike when their contracts expire next June 30 . Their goal : Wage increases that keep pace with double-digit inflation . Even before the walkout , transit workers rejected the transit authority 's offer of a 6 percent pay hike in each of the next two years . The bus and subway drivers , who had averaged $7.58  | an hour , said they should be compensated now for the sacrifices they made to help save the city from financial disaster in 1975 . By their estimate , wages have fallen 30 percent behind inflation in the past five years . " I think they should give us a good contract , because we 've been bending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its fiscal crisis , and it 's the city 's turn to give us a break , " says William Schoon , a 52-year-old bus driver . But inconvenienced commuters were unsympathetic . " In my opinion , they do n't deserve a raise , " says Josephine Baldwin , a stenographer from Brooklyn who was stranded by the strike . " They make a really good salary and have good benefits . " More strikes coming ? Government officials were afraid to meet demands for a bigger pay hike , knowing the other city unions would want the same . Current budget projections allow for annual wage increases of only 4 percent for city workers . Each percentage point in higher wages will cost another 50 million dollars . Such figures spawned fears that the strike would bring another increase in transit fares . Although city leaders have promised to hold fares to 50 cents through 1981 , the deficit-ridden transit authority already has scheduled public hearings on an anticipated 15-to-25-cent hike . " Everybody I 've talked to has resigned himself to a fare increase , " said Manhattan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city officials were reluctant to imprison the leaders of this strike as Mayor John V. Lindsay did during the 12-day walkout in 1966 . New York state 's Taylor Act provides for striking public workers to be jailed , fined and deprived of two days ' pay for each day on strike . " I 'm not interested in sending anybody to jail because that would just make them martyrs , " said Mayor Koch . Nor did this strike hit the city by surprise , as did the one in 1966 . Emergency procedures were in place as soon as the buses and subways stopped . Cars with fewer than two passengers were barred from downtown Manhattan , causing drivers to pick up hitchhikers along the highway . Special lanes were set aside for bicycles . Extra police were assigned to direct traffic . New ways to commute . Most big employers , such as New York Telephone and Consolidated Edison , rented hotel rooms or chartered buses for their employes . A flotilla of hired boats brought about 10,000 commuters across the East River each morning . City officials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 30,000 walked , and daily ridership on the Staten Island Ferry almost doubled , to 30,000 . Helicopters did a booming business at 5140 a trip for three riders . Bike rentals cost more than $14 a day , plus a $150 deposit . Walking prompted many office workers to appear in business suits and jogging shoes . One pedestrian , Harry Steinberg , 70 , suffered a fatal heart attack while walking home across the Brooklyn Bridge on the first day of the strike . He had trekked more than 10 miles to get to work that day . About 240,000 automobiles entered the central city each day , compared with 185,000 on a normal day . Traffic came dangerously close to a condition known to experts as " grid lock " ? when so many cars try to move in all directions that everything simply comes to a halt . A patrolman breaking up a fist City With a Pile of Woes  | fight between a motorist and a pedestrian in Times Square noted : " Everybody 's nerves are a bit frayed . " More than 20 percent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ initial days of the strike . Hardest hit : The small garment factories concentrated between Times Square and Madison Square Garden . Solomon , the deputy mayor for economic development , estimated that 39 percent of the apparel industry 's 153,000 employes stayed home on the first day of the strike . No cab fare . " Insurance companies make lots of money , and they can afford to hire buses to bring in their people , " said an aide to Solomon . " But the garment-industry companies are smaller and ca n't afford to do that . Many of the workers live in the outer boroughs and ca n't afford to come to work in cabs . " Grace Grossmann , president of the Chamber of Commerce of the Apparel Industry , predicted that some firms might be forced out of business by the strike . " Many of these firms are marginal , " she said . " They 've got bills to pay , they ca n't produce anything and they ca n't afford to borrow at these interest rates . " Fur manufacturers feared the production @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Germany in mid-April . The strike was blamed for reducing New York City 's daily gross product of 450 million dollars by about 20 percent . Retail stores suffered big losses . At 10:45 a.m. one day , only six customers roamed the first floor of Gimbel 's mammoth store . " This is killing business , " said the owner of a shop at the subway terminal in Flushing . Mort Getman , executive vice president of the New York Chamber of Commerce and Industry , believed the city 's losses were being exaggerated . Said Getman : " What happens is that lots of people put off their purchases a week or so or shop in neighborhood stores instead of in Manhattan . " But Deputy Mayor Solomon maintained that many of the losses would be permanent . As an example , he noted that many clothing buyers for retail stores were unable to get hotel reservations to attend a major apparel show during the first week in April . " It is very likely that business will not return to New York , " said Solomon . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ canceled at Madison Square Garden . The operator of a midtown steakhouse reported : " We depend heavily on the lunch trade , and our business has been cut in half . " But crime also declined . " It may be that criminals also were having a tough time getting to their jobs , " a police lieutenant speculated . The strike compounded the financial woes of city government . While costing the city 2 million dollars a day in revenue ? including $200,000 for violations of traffic regulations whose enforcement was temporarily suspended ? it added nearly 1 million in expenses . City Budget Director James Brigham figured the city spent $925,000 a day on overtime wages for emergency services , mostly to pay additional emergency traffic policemen . Fortunately for city officials , the strike began on Passover , the Jewish holiday , when many planned to stay home . This allowed the city one full day to get ready for a full-blown traffic jam ? which occurred as expected . Warm weather and school vacations helped , too . Little effect on big money . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Citibank reported 95 percent attendance . On the New York Stock Exchange , office employes took over for floor workers who arrived late . Some companies adjusted their working hours to avoid rush-hour traffic . Stuart-Dean , a **32;205;TOOLONG firm , instructed its workers to report at 6 a.m. each day ? several hours ahead of the normal time . " If too much time is lost , we can not afford to let them work , " says Kevin Cullen of Stuart-Dean . Along with hotels and taverns , taxis and neighborhood liquor stores were busier than ever . A shoeshine-stand operator observed : " You got to figure that all those shoes scraping along the sidewalk are going to do me just fine . " All this supported Koch 's view . " New Yorkers , " he said , " can endure anything . New Yorkers can do anything , and they can do it on one foot . " But 1980 could put endurance to the ultimate test .

Remarked Connell : " I 'm afraid it 's going to be a busy year . "
