txt WASHINGTON  --  A high Treasury Department uflicial accused White Rouse economists Monday of rigging deficit numbers in an effort to persuade President Reagan to propose a new tax increase . The accusation by Paul Craig Roberts , assistant secretary of the Treasury for economic policy , came after Reagan 's chief economic adviser , Murray Weidenbaum , said the administration is considering a new excise tax on natural gas . In an interview , Roberts said that the Office of Management and ? Budget ( OMB ) and the Council of Economic Advisers ( CEA ) prepared an unrealistic economic forecast for the next three years to show larger deficits than will actually be the case . He said the forecasts have been " rigged to produce the worst deficit possible " with the aim of persuading the President to go along With a tax increase . IN THAT FORECAST , widely leaked a weekagu , the administration predicted that the federal deficits will exceed $100 billion during each of the next three years unless Congress acts to reduce them . Asked about Weldenbaum 's disclosure of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said : " It 's not the Treasury trying to push the President to raise taxes . It 's OMB , CEA , and the White House staff . " He said the forecast of huge deficits contains assumptions for the growth in the money supply that are unrealistically tight for the next three years . lie said the forecast for real economic growth is too low and not in line with previous experience . Also , he said , the assumptions include " tremendous markdowns " in inflation forecasts made earlier . THE LEAKED forecast of extremely large tleticittr. he said , provides the impetus for officials to find a way to reduce them through a combination of tax increases and spending cuts . The administration is known to be considering a variety of tax increases , along with billions more in spending cuts . . Roberts , an ardent supply-side economist who believes ? that recent cuts In high tax interest rates will fuel strong economic growth , called the deficit numbers " worst-case projections based on on an unrealistic assumption about ever-tightening monetary policy . " Roberts said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ major policy defeat " for Reagan , who it is believed does not favor such a hike . In addition , he said , a to increase would send the wrong signal to the private sector . It would tell investors the government wants to remain big , he said , and to keep spending a large percentage of gross national product . WEIDENBAUM TOLD reporters that an excise tax on natural gas would bring in from $10 billion to $20 billion annually and would ' be accompanied by a phaseout of price controls on natural gas . Weldenbaum implied that an excise tax is preferable to a windfall profits tax , which he called a " tax on capital " that would reduce the money available to invest in producing energy . Asked if Reagan were amenable to an excise tax on natural gas , he responded : " Amenable is n't a term that conies to mind . I have n't noticed any encouragement from him one way or another . " Explaining Weldenbaum 's remarks , officials said an " excise-type " tax is under discussion , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " An excise tax works like a sales tax . For example , the federal gasoline and cigarette taxes are excise taxes which are included in the retail price . Officials said that such a tax could be levied at any level In the production and distribution chain and that Weidenbaum did n't mean to indicate that it would be an add-on to consumer bills . But the economic adviser , asked directly at what level the tax would apply , said thit any such levy has a major effect by encouraging conservation . That means , in effect , it would raise the cost to users , who would have to find ways to reduce consumption to save money . GOING TO AN excise tax would be one way around a Cont hilted. on page 16 , col .. 5 Deficits rigged , official charges // promise mode by Reagan during last year 's tax debate . He wrote a letter to Rep. Glenn English ( D. , Okla. ) that ' he would not sign a windfall profits tax on natural gas should controls on that fuel be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said that promise was written on paper , not in cement , and that the President may have to eat some promises as he tries to find a way to cut massive deficits facing the ' nation . Price controls on natural gas are due to expire in 1983 . Many key officials within the administration want to accelerate the pace of decontrol , but Reagan himself has made no final decision . Some within the administration fear the political fallout from speedier decontrol . An administration official said decontrol itself is not necessarily inflationary . if there is no increase in the money supply to satisfy new inflationary pressures caused by higher natural gas prices , consumers would be forced to conserve energy or cut back spending in other areas , it is felt within the administration . ON CAPITOL IIILL , Rep. Daniel Rostenkowski Chicago ) , chairman of the House Ways and Means ' Committee , refused to say how an energy tax would fare in Congress . He said Democrats want to see Reagan 's prograth In writing before commenting .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
