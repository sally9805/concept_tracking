 | R everse the hot- and cold-water pipes in your home , and you 'll still get water ( even though your next shower will be a nuisance ) . Reverse the hot and neutral lines of your home wiring system , and you 'll still get electricity . But now the possibilty of a shock hazard exists . Conventional 120-volt-AC household circuits have two current-carrying conductors . One is neutral ; it has about the same electrical potential as the earth . The other is hot ; it has a constantly changing potential different from that of the earth . The National Electrical Code ( NEC ) calls for maintaining hot-neutral wiring continuity throughout the house ? from the utility entrance to the lamp in the den . The reason : appliance safety . All appliances are designed to keep the hot line as far away from the user as possible . For example , in a lamp the center contact of the bulb socket @# is designed to be hot ; it 's difficult to touch and is switched off when the lamp is turned off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This keeps the screw base of the bulb ? which might be touched while screwing the bulb in or out ? at ground potential . However , if the hot and neutral lines to the socket are reversed , the bulb base becomes connected to the hot side of the circuit . You increase the chance of shock when changing the bulb .

How can you test for reverse polarity ? What can you do to correct it ? The tests are simple and so are many of the cures . If you uncover more-serious problems , you should call an electrician . Here 's what you need to know : At the outlet To maintain the correct polarity to an appliance , all outlets and plugs should be polarized . That means the outlet will accept the plug in only one direction . To do that , the outlet has one slot larger than the other , and one prong on the appliance plug is wider than the other . Look closely at each electrical outlet in your home . Most manufactured since the 1930s should be polarized . Each should contain one long and one short slot . And , as of 1968 , all new installations use polarized outlets with a third D-shaped hole for a ground conductor . However , if both slots are the same length , the outlet is not polarized and should be replaced , if possible . You can buy polarized two-hole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if no grounding wire is provided by your house wiring . ( For additional safety , the latest NEC permits a ground-fault circuit-interrupter receptacle to be used for a non-grounding-type receptacle where no means of grounding exists in the outlet box . It has special grounding requirements . Check the NEC guidelines . ) If there is a grounding wire or if you 're willing to provide one for the circuit , you should replace the nonpolarized receptacle with a modern three-hole grounding-type receptacle . But having polarized outlets in your house and using them with polarized plugs does n't mean you 're automati86 POPULAR SCIENCE cally protected . Polarity can easily I , reversed behind the walls by an incorrect wiring hookup . The short sh should be connected to the hot side the circuit , and the long slot connecter to the neutral side .

All you net is a neon test light like the GE mod. 2598-01D or any other 125/250-vol. rated electrical tester . A voltmeter w : work , but do n't use a low-voltage r continuity tester . The tests will dar age these instruments . And for yousafety , do not use a body-capacitancetype neon tester ( see box ) . Checking an older two-hole polarize receptacle is also easy , provided its eel ter cover screw is grounded . If you tests show no sign of voltage ( light remains off ) between the screw and or . of the prongs , there is no ground ( ( no voltage is present ) . In this case you 'll have to supply a ground from another source . How ? You could bring a grounded jumper wire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then you could make the test using a neon test light or voltmeter between the receptacle and the jumper . Trouble is , this methoc has you holding a grounded wire in one hand and shoving a test prod int . a live receptacle slot with the other The hand-to-hand 120-volt potential with a through-the-heart electrical - pathway to ground leaves this popular electrical test open to criticise , Do n't do it . The safest way is to use a professional 's test light that has an insulated alligator-clip grounding lead One brand is the Circuitracer Mode . 100 ( Desco Ind. , 761 Penarth Ave Walnut , Calif. 91789 ; about $12 ) . The Circuitracer has a test prod at onL end and a clip-type pigtail test leac at the other . A 220-kilohm resistor inserted in series with the neon lamp serves as a further current-limiting device for added safety . In use , the Circuitracer 's insulated pigtail lead is clipped to a ground . Then , using one hand ( a standard procedure is to place your other hand behind your back as shown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insert Circuitracer 's single test prod into a receptacle slot . Lacking a professional 's - best method is to do - to- hand exposure to converting an ordinary neon test light or voltmeter . ( You 're forgoing the Circuitracer 's protective incircuit resistor , however . ) Simply splice and insulate a short jumper wire to one pigtail of the tester . Then put an alligator clip on the end of the jumper . The result : a 125/250-volt neon test light ( or vo ltmeter ) with the usual test prod at one end end and a longer grounding-clip lead at the other . A water pipe usually makes a good test ground unless plastic pipe has been used somewhere in the system . If so , look for another ground . An electric meter box ? not a socket --  is almost always grounded . Never ground to a gas pipe . It may be leaking small amounts of gas , and your test could create a small spark .

( Always check with a test light to be sure it 's off . ) Then remove the outlet cover ( and possibly the outlet ) to inspect its wiring . In most cases , one or more black or red wires are used as hot wires . They are supposed to be connected to the brass ( darker-colored ) terminal for the short slot . White or gray wires are used as neutrals . They should be connected to the chrome ( lighter-colored ) terminal for the long slot .

Now the plug is required on all Edison-base lamps and flat-wire two-conductor extension cords , and is used on practically all tools and home appliances . The plug 's two blade widths guarantee the correct polarity from the outlet to the appliance . ( Three-prong grounding plugs are polarized as well because the prong configuration allows them to be plugged-in only one way . ) Never replace a polarized plug with a nonpolarized one . Similarly , do n't file down the wide prong of a polarized plug to make it fit a nonpolarized outlet . And to maintain the correct polarization to an appliance , always use polarized extension cords and multipleoutlet taps instead of nonpolarized ones . Of course , a nonpolarized plug will work in a polarized receptacle , but the correct polarity could be lost depending on how the plug is turned when plugged into the outlet . Where possible , replace nonpolarized plugs with polarized ones . On appliances that use cords with color-coded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( hot ) blade of the plug , the white wire to the wide ( neutral ) blade . Flat lamp cord is not color coded , but usually one of its two wires has a ribbed coating ; the other is smooth . Attach the ribbed wire to the wide blade , the smooth wire to the narrow one . You can also test an appliance for the correct polarity by using a continuity tester or ohmmeter . For example , the tester should show continuity between the socket shell of a lamp and the large prong of its plug ( see drawings ) . Most appliances do n't have exposed conductors , but for those that do ( toaster , etc. ) , the conductor should show continuity to the wide ( neutral ) prong , and no continuity to the narrow ( hot ) blade when the appliance is switched off . If you suspect that an appliance hFs reverse polarity but ca n't accurately test it , call a professional .                 @ @ @ @
