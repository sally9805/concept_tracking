After a series of warnings , an Argentine warship began to fire at a Taiwanese squid trawler , leaving the vessel in flames . The casualties : one Taiwanese killed , one missing and five injured . <P> The clash was the latest round in Argentina 's improbable squid war , in which the Buenos Aires government , claiming control over its coastal waters to a distance of 200 miles , has been trying to clear the region of as many as 300 foreign trawlers . Over the past month , the Argentines have chased or captured fishing boats from Spain , Japan , Poland and Taiwan . The Taiwanese vessel may have been trying to escape the warship by heading toward the 150-mile-deep British exclusion zone around the Falkland Islands . Taiwan was furious . Britain , which fought Argentina to retain the Falklands in 1982 , denounced the latest action as " excessive and unjustified . "
