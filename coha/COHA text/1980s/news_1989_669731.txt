Peasants line the dusty road out of Mandalay , eager to catch a glimpse of this charismatic woman , Aung San Suu Kyi , who dares to oppose a repressive junta. // // They throw garlands around her neck as she travels down yet another bumpy road in her campaign to restore democracy - and perhaps to run their country. // ' ' Long live Aung San Suu Kyi , ' ' the peasants chant . If they chant anything political , they risk Army arrest for violating campaign laws. // Political gatherings of more than 50 people are outlawed . Troops trail her entourage , watching for the slightest infraction . Harassment is common . Foreign journalists are stopped for questioning. // Supporters in her party , the National League of Democracy , pass out buttons showing a photo of her late father , Aung San , the national hero and the man who led Burma to independence before he was assassinated in 1947 . The photographs include a small image of his daughter perched on the famed leader ' s shoulder. // But despite this political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to running in the election. // At present , she says , the task is building and organizing the party to support democracy. // Even though there is a ban on political pamphlets , campaign workers hand out copies of her speeches , which call for an end to 27 years of Army rule and for fulfilling the Army ' s promise - following a bloody uprising last year - to hold fair elections in early 1990. // But both buttons and speeches are not enough to reach enough people quickly . The most potent tactic used during her six months on the hustings is a video camera , carried by an inconspicuous aide. // After capturing her public moves and words each day , the video tapes are copied and recopied , spreading her message into the farthest corners of Burma. // ' ' Campaigning is expensive , and we have no money , ' ' says Suu Kyi , who spent most of the last two decades outside of Burma and is thus relatively unknown - except for her name. // To quickly exploit that tie , she employs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ready-made to undermine the political monopoly of an authoritarian regime. // The tapes are hot sellers on Burma ' s well-run black market , and a challenge to the military that tightly restricts information flow in a nation of approximately 40 million people. // The regime , which bans anything but its own message on the country ' s only television broadcast , announced a crackdown last month on regulated video stores. // Many stores carry the tapes showing Aung San Suu Kyi , but must do so clandestinely . Demand is high . Customers are willingly to pay an amount equal to three or four days of an average daily wage . Some of the tapes include excerpts from last year ' s violence in Rangoon. // In a nation already fearful and divided over how to end Army rule , the tapes add to personal conflicts. // ' ' My father won ' t let me bring the tape home , ' ' says government worker Sun Yu Din. // Her father , a retired Army colonel , is a timber exporter . He forbids any mention of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ' All over Burma , families are arguing with each other , ' ' says Sun Yu Din . ' ' We now say there is one house , two bodies. ' ' // In more ways than one , the video tapes are an affront to the Army , which itself appears divided over whether to allow a fair election to take place. // Not only do the tapes spread the popularity of Suu Kyi , they also undercut the Army ' s claim to rule. // Longtime strong man Ne Win first broached the idea of allowing a multiparty system last July , after 26 years of leading his country to near-economic ruin . He could not have imagined the emergence of an opposition leader more antithetical to the Army. // ' ' It ' s like Jane Fonda running for American president , ' ' says one Rangoon-based diplomat. // Living in Britain with an English husband , Aung San Suu Kyi came back to Burma last year to visit her dying mother and quickly got caught up in a revolt that needed a civilian leader. // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fractured political opposition . She also challenges the military ' s major justification for staying in power so long - that the Army represents the legacy of her father , Aung San . Ne Win was a subordinate to Aung San during the struggle for independence. // And he , ironically , put Aung San ' s name on many things in Burma - currency , roads , stadiums , marketplaces. // ' ' My father didn ' t build up the Burmese Army in order to oppress the people , ' ' says Suu Kyi , now the bete noire of that Army. // ' ' He made many speeches where he specifically said , ' Don ' t start oppressing the people just because you have weapons . You are to serve the country . You are for the country , the country is not for you , ' ' ' she adds. // She says the military should be purely professional. // As her tapes have spread throughout Burma and her claims to the legacy been made known , the government has increasingly tried to discredit Suu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on her staff ( she says they are ex-communists ) . They say she threatens the dominant race , the Burmese , by promising autonomy to other nationalities . And , among the normally xenophobic Burmese , they play up the fact that she ' s married to a foreigner. // ' ' There ' s great tension between the regime ' s commitment to an election and the danger of her popularity , ' ' says an Australian diplomat . ' ' It ' s like walking around gasoline fumes with metal taps on your shoes. ' ' // Unlike Benazir Bhutto in Pakistan or Corazon Aquino in the Philippines , Suu Kyi has no political experience , says government spokesman U Ohn Kyaw. // ' ' After spending 24 or 25 years abroad , where is the legacy ? ' ' he asks . ' ' If she is so much attached to the Burmese people , why should she leave the country ? ' ' // Even in the splintered opposition , she faces plenty of detractors . Many student leaders resent her taking the lead after hundreds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ' She is swimming to power on the blood of students , ' ' says one campus organizer. // Another opposition leader , ex-general Aung Gyi , split with her in December , mainly over a personality conflict. // ' ' She ' s fairly abrasive and sharp for a Burmese , ' ' says a European diplomat . ' ' But for now , she ' s the catalyst for democracy , although she may not be an unstoppable force. ' ' // Many diplomats wonder if Suu Kyi enjoys the limelight so much that she might never be able to make a necessary accommodation with all - or part - of the military . Her strongest ally in the National League for Democracy is an ex-general , U Tin Oo . The two joined forces last year. // ' ' She gains experience day by day , ' ' he says . ' ' If she doesn ' t understand something , she listens. ' ' // And the more she campaigns , says Mr. Tin Oo , the more she is emerging from her father ' s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
