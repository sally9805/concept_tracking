Claims arbitration begins <P> The yellow ribbons have long since disappeared . Most of the 52 former American hostages have picked up their careers and moved ahead with their lives . But the complex deal that won their release four months ago will probably keep lawyers , bankers and diplomats busy for years to come . Last week U.S. and Iranian negotiating teams met in the velvet-lined boardroom of the Palace of Peace in The Hague to ; begin carrying out the most controversial feature of that agreement : arbitration of their respective corporate and private financial claims . <P> Under the terms of the deal , President Carter barred American citizens or companies from suing Iran in U.S. courts . Instead , all American claims were to be submitted to an " arbitration panel " consisting of three Americans , three Iranians and three independent members . The same panel was to process Iran 's counterclaims . American claims judged to be valid would be paid out of a special " security account , " funded with $1 billion of the estimated $12 billion in Iranian assets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> Of the remaining Iranian assets that were unfrozen , nearly $8 billion was originally delivered to an escrow account in the Bank of England pending release of the hostages . Shortly after the 52 returned home , Iran used part of the money to repay about $3.7 billion in syndicated international loans . Another $1.4 billion went into a second escrow fund to liquidate loans from individual banks . Thus Iran has directly received only about $2.87 billion so far-a paltry sum compared with the $24 billion " ransom " that Tehran 's revolutionary regime had originally demanded . In addition , some $2.3 billion in Iranian assets remains in U.S. banks pending court decisions concerning the numerous attachments on these funds . This money might ultimately be used to satisfy American claims . <P> Last week 's arbitration proceedings began at a snail 's pace . The first order of business was to choose the panel 's three neutral members . Led by Lawyer and veteran Negotiator George Aldrich , the U.S. team put forward several names . But the Iranian delegates , led by Spokesman Seyyed Hossein @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the selection process seemed certain to continue into this week . Iranian foot dragging only complicated an already knotty set of problems . For one thing , there is a staggering total of more than 2,000 American claims to process . Another hitch : many U.S. claimants are threatening to challenge the constitutionality of Carter 's order barring suits against Iran . Until the Supreme Court rules on that question , the funds that Iran still has in U.S. banks will remain tied up . International efforts to untangle all these snarls , U.S. Negotiator Aldrich predicted , " will likely last for years . "
