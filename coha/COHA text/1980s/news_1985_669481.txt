Forty years ago , when GIs returned from World War II with a pent-up demand for instant housing , a lot of them found the answer in factory-built , aluminum structures which were known simply as ' ' trailer houses. ' ' // No one really wanted them in ' ' their neighborhood ' ' at the time . But then the ' ' trailers ' ' of yesterday began to change . As the demand for roll-your-own housing grew , the structures widened and lengthened into today ' s ' ' mobile home. ' ' // // Actually , the polite term these days is ' ' manufactured housing ' ' ( made legal by Congress in the 1980 Housing Act ) and mobility is only relative. // A modern-day manufactured home may roll to a homesite with 1 , 800 square feet or more of living space , and sport such features as a sunken living room , eat-in country kitchen , and fireplace - virtually everything to be found in a site-built home except a basement. // Also , as the built-to-be-towed house has changed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' 50s , a big share of mobile homes were owned by construction workers , oil-field employees and military servicemen - people whose employment or life style called for frequent moves. // In the 1960s , retirees and others who wanted to stay in one place found the mobile home an affordable option to conventional housing . Just about then , however , younger couples discovered mobile homes could provide a comfortable alternative to small , two-bedroom , ' ' starter , ' ' site-built houses that long had been the first homes for most newlyweds. // ' ' We began in a 10-by-50-footer in the mid- ' 60s , ' ' says Ted Maynard of Columbia , Mo . ' ' Then we gradually traded up , first to a 12-by-65-foot mobile home , and then to an even larger unit. ' ' // Mr. Maynard , an auto mechanic by trade , and his wife , Dorothy , a bookkeeper , found that mobile-home living suited them well . Rather than move into a conventional home when their income and financial situation would permit , Mr. Maynard says , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home , although the family planned to stay in the same area. // The Maynards have been joined by an increasingly broad group of Americans . Today , nearly 1 out of every 3 new single-family dwellings is a manufactured home. // Mobile homes are no longer the housing of choice primarily for families who lead a nomadic existence . More manufactured homes are moving into subdivisions or onto private property , instead of poorly situated parks where homeowners lease a site. // While mobile-home owners , on the average , are becoming more permanent - and more affluent - cost still is a big motive for buying a factory-built house . A survey by National Family Opinion Inc. , conducted for the Foremost Insurance Company of Grand Rapids , Mich. ( a leading insurer of mobile homes ) , shows the average mobile-home buyer pays about $22 , 000 for his dwelling , compared with a national average of nearly $90 , 000 for a conventional new single-family house. // That feature helped the trend toward manufactured housing gain momentum in the early 1980s when mortgage rates of 15 percent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of home ownership . While interest rates are as high , or higher , on loans to buy mobile homes as on mortgages for conventional homes , $22 , 000 is far easier to finance than is , say , $60 , 000 or $70 , 000 on a $90 , 000 house. // During 1982-83 , with site-built home construction slowed virtually to a standstill , about one-half million new manufactured homes were purchased. // ' ' Further evidence of how the industry has matured is the availability of 30-year mortgages on some manufactured homes , ' ' write the authors of the Foremost survey report . They note that while three-quarters of all new mobile-home purchases are financed on terms of 10 years or less , a growing number of loans - such as those backed by the Federal Housing Administration and Veterans Administration - are stretched to longer terms. // And even though lower initial cost was a big reason given by survey respondents for buying a manufactured home , it was not the major advantage listed for mobile-home living . More than two-fifths ( 42 percent ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ' is the main thing they like about their dwellings. // Still , a more affordable buying price ranks high . And , in most cases , that $22 , 000 average price includes all furnishings , appliances , carpeting , and draperies . A buyer can choose a mobile home on the dealer ' s lot , have it towed to his property or rental site ( the cost of towing and setup usually is included in the purchase price ) , and move in the same day. // When National Family Opinion pollsters surveyed some 9 , 000 mobile-home residents across the nation , they found results that may be surprising to some people . One long-held image of mobile-home dwellers , for example , is that they are from a lower socioeconomic class . Not so , according to the survey . The median income of mobile-home buyers is actually a bit higher than the median income of all United States households. // While retirees make up about 25 percent of all mobile-home owners , the survey found that 43 percent of the families living in manufactured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old or younger . One out of every four owners is employed in a white-collar occupation - about the same percentage as found among retirees. // The survey also turned up interesting facts about where mobile homes are located . Some 45 percent are in mobile-home parks where the homeowner pays a monthly rental. // That percentage is down from 48 percent just five years ago . More and more manufactured homes are being located on the owner ' s private property . Too , some 29 percent of all existing mobile homes are on plots of one acre or larger , contrary to popular prevailing opinion of this type of housing. // There also appears to be a switch from the previous trend of families using mobile homes as an affordable entry into conventional housing later on : 44 percent of current mobile-home dwellers moved there from a site-built house . Further , 72 percent say they will continue to live in the same or another mobile home for the foreseeable future . Only 28 percent plan their next residence to be a site-built house. // For a growing number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question of affordable permanent housing. // //
