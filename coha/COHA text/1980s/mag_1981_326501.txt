The Presidency/Hugh Sidey <P> Ronald Reagan , triumphant but a bit weary from the tax-cut victory , is looking forward to a few days of wood chopping and thinking on his California ranch . Then , if current schedules hold , by Aug. 15 he will make up his mind and soon thereafter tell the world that he wants America 's new MX missiles to be air launched , ultimately from new and sophisticated planes that could stay aloft for days . <P> Reagan faces no military issue more important , or more fraught with peril and charged with controversy . Already , the decision may be 90% made in the President 's mind as events in the Dr. Strangelove world of nukes and launchers seem to be moving toward a final shape that has stunned the Pentagon , the industrial complex that builds the military 's hardware and the defense experts of Congress . Subterranean shock waves came last week from the secret and cheerless Room 31074 in the Pentagon . There Richard D. DeLauer , Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering , revealed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Physicist Charles Townes , that is assigned to find a satisfactory MX launching system . The session was chaotic . Most of the committee 's 14 members find the air-launch idea doubtful because of structural and guidance problems , as well as the cost , which could reach $125 billion . But because DeLauer spoke for Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger , and because Weinberger and Reagan are such close friends , the belief is that the scheme has thus far received the President 's blessing . <P> DeLauer proposed that the MX first be carried by C-5A Galaxy transports , redesigned and shielded against nuclear-attack radiation . But by 1990 they would be moved to radically new planes that would have structural materials and wing configurations permitting them to stay aloft for as long as a week . Until that airborne MX system is in place , DeLauer suggested , the U.S. could rely on antiballistic missiles to protect its aging Minutemen . <P> That would require abrogation of the Treaty on the Limitation of Antiballistic Missile Systems with the Soviets . In ten years , DeLauer said , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that depth a missile is totally protected from any explosion , though clearing surface debris for a launch after a nuclear blast ( which can turn sand to stone ) remains an unsolved technical problem . Supplementing the missiles would be a new B-1 bomber and existing cruise missiles . Ideas for putting MX missiles on new submarines or surface ships were brushed aside . <P> Lost in the planning turmoil was the original MX design , with its 4,600 shelters scattered across the deserts of Utah and Nevada . Three billion dollars has already been invested in that system , but it is opposed by powerful Republican Senators Jake Garn of Utah and Paul Laxalt of Nevada . There is little question that Reagan wants to avoid crossing his powerful political friends . White House Counsellor Ed Meese is believed to feel that the original MX system was devised to fit Jimmy Carter 's failed hopes for a nuclear arms limitation treaty and , thus , the multiple-shelters idea is tainted and must be scrapped .               @ @ @ @ @ @
