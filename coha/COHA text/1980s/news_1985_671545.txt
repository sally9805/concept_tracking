The chairman of the City Planning Commission , Herbert J. Sturz , said yesterday that engineering companies had been chosen by his agency and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority to study the feasibility of such a line. // A probable site for much of its route is a well-hidden Conrail right of way that begins on Washington Street in Greenwich Village and reaches Spuyten Duyvil at the northern tip of Manhattan . Much of the line runs through a tunnel beneath Riverside Park and through an open cut 23 feet below street level between 10th and 11th Avenues , west of midtown. // // Route to Television City // The first phase of such a project , Mr. Sturz said , is likely to run from the unused Penn Central rail yards between 72d and 59th Streets - where the developer Donald J. Trump has announced plans to transform the yards into a huge project called Television City - to either 42d Street or 33d Street. // At 42d Street , the line could link with an often-discussed crosstown trolley or monorail . At 33d Street it could feed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a huge storage yard the M.T.A. is completing for the Long Island Rail Road from 10th to 12th Avenues between 31st and 33d Streets. // A shuttle could link the yard with Pennsylvania Station , three blocks away . And a one-block northern extention could feed directly into the Convention Center , which is scheduled to open next April 1 amid severe concerns about the adequacy of its transportation ties to midtown. // Many of the other transportation plans for the West Side seek to address the needs of the center , which is being built without visitor parking , although it is expected to draw more than 4 , 000 cars on busy days . <> <> New Parking Regulations // These are some of the concerns : // * Severe limitations on parking and standing between Eighth and 12th Avenues from 28th to 45th Street . The regulations , which would outlaw parking and standing on many streets between 7 A.M. and 10 P.M. , are scheduled to be phased in over the next three months. // * The conversion of 49th and 50th Streets into express bus and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or not at all. // * The possible paving of some of the below-street level Conrail right of way between 50th Street and the Convention Center to accommodate the express buses. // * The rerouting of at least four bus lines to pass the new center. // Mr. Trump ' s proposal and the Convention Center are merely the most public of the large development projects planned for an area west of Eighth Avenue that has long been the home of manufacturing buildings , many of which are now underused , and the Clinton residential community , one of the few remaining polyglot working-class neighborhoods south of 96th Street. // There have been persistent rumors , for example , that Madison Square Garden will relocate to a site atop the new rail yards. // Of all the proposals , however , the light rail system would be the most sweeping , creating a new transit spine in a city that has not experienced a major addition to its mass-transportation system in half a century. // Mr. Sturz ' s agency has been making the plans along with the Battery Park City @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the city and state transportation departments . He said that , according to rough estimates , a light rail system could cost $50 million a mile , with stations and track work included , over the 12-mile length of Manhattan Island. // Meyer S. Frucher , president of the Battery Park City Authority and the author of memorandums proposing a northern expansion of his project from Chambers Street to 34th Street , said a line could be in operation 5 to 10 years from now . <> <> Westway Trade-In Money // " We are working with the city to develop mutual plans , " he said . " The Governor in his State of the State address next month will talk of a major study to explore the West Side in terms of transportation and development. " // According to preliminary talk , much of the funding for the project would come from hundreds of millions of dollars in mass-transit and highway trade-in funds the city and state became eligible for when they abandoned the proposed Westway highway and development project after several court defeats. // Mayor Koch said yesterday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that would lead to benefits to his Television City project. // Other officials held out the possibility that the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey could be called on to participate if the rail line extended from the authority ' s underused bus terminal at the George Washington Bridge at 177th Street to the World Trade Center , which it operates . <> <> Determining the Fare // The focuses of all the studies include the cost of the project - which would likely determine the cost of the fare - the best route for a rail line , and the form it should take. // Under the heading of light rail , Mr. Sturz said , are a number of systems including monorails , which include single rails from which cabs are suspended , cable cars and other cable-linked systems , and trolleys. // The route of a system has focused on the Conrail tracks , which are now dormant , but which are scheduled to be turned over to Amtrak so the nearly 20 Amtrak trains a day that now operate out of Grand Central Terminal can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city ' s Amtrak trains. // The right of way ranges in width from about 55 feet to 125 feet , with the two tracks running through it taking up between 34 and 50 feet . <> <> Dispute Over Lower Part // At 33d Street , the line rises above grade and cuts a weaving path to Washington Street . The West Side Rail Foundation , a nonprofit organization that anticipated the current interest in the West Side , has tried for years to buy this stretch of track and is embroiled in court and bureaucratic disputes with the state and local property owners. // A rail line could either follow the path of this track or continue down West Street from 33d Street. // M.T.A. interest in the site was kindled by a study of the West Side ' s rail needs instigated by Robert R. Kiley , the agency ' s chairman , last year. // Mr. Frucher and Mr. Sturz said the collapse of Westway had led them to focus anew on the far West Side , and Mr. Sturz said Mr. Trump ' s plans for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " In our thinking , if we ' re going to have anywhere near this density , we ' re going to have to think of how to move people in and out of the site , " he said. //
