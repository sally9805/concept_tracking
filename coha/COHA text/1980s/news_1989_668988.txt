The budget President Bush has sent to Congress is a lot like the campaign that elected him . It substitutes clever tactics for sound long-range strategy . It discomfits the Democrats more than it serves the country . In the broadest terms , it confirms the suspicion that Bush has nothing very much he hopes to accomplish here at home . If he makes his mark in the history books , he intends to do it in foreign policy-not in domestic affairs . Those may seem sweeping conclusions to draw barely a month into the new administration . But if there is one rule that experience has demonstrated in the postwar period , it is that the largest accomplishments in domestic policy are likely to come immediately after a president ' s first election . Bush slid through the autumn campaign without defining one domestic policy goal , and none is discernible in his budget . There ' s no bold headline in the whole 193 pages . It ' s a backing-and-filling budget , which tackles head-on neither the deficit problem nor any other policy issue . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ target set by the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings law than any long-term objective of the man who is supposed to be leading America . In defense policy , it offers a one-year freeze on inflation-adjusted spending , but is silent on the policy choices that clampdown may require . By holding out the promise of a more liberal Pentagon allowance in subsequent years , it tempts the military planners to postpone the hard decisions and nickel-and-dime their way through this one lean year . In domestic policy , it offers two big " no ' s " and a lot of little " yeses . " It says no to cost-of-living allowances for military and civilian government retirees , and it tells the hospitals and doctors they will have to swallow some $5 billion of the rising costs of Medicare . On the increase side , there are dibs and dabs of money for a variety of social programs ranging from acid-rain cleanup and AIDS research to low-income feeding and health programs . These are modest down payments on what was , even in Bush ' s campaign , a modest program of domestic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there ' s not a hint that Bush or his associates have a real passion to do any one thing well or an idea that could lead to a breakthrough on any of the intractable problems facing the country ' s schools , cities , transportation systems or trade practices . Most of all , the budget tacitly concedes that Bush will settle for tiny , marginal improvements in the federal deficit . Even those depend on optimistic , if not totally implausible , economic assumptions . He simply has not summoned the will to break the back of that chronic drain on our economic future . For all that , Bush and Budget Director Richard Darman have crafted a set of budget tactics which throw the Democrats on the defensive . The " flexible freeze " that served to disguise budget choices during the campaign has taken on a new wrinkle . Bush specifies his preferred add-ons , and leaves it to the congressional Democrats to single out the places where compensating cuts in discretionary domestic programs should be made . The Democrats are screaming foul , but they know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ borrowed the idea Sen. Pete Domenici ( R. , N.M. ) put forward three years ago of requiring budget-makers to " trade in and trade up , " cutting or discarding ineffective or outdated programs to pay for new ones of greater importance . It was a sound idea then and it still is . But Bush has changed the rules to let the President designate winners , while Congress bears the onus of naming the losers . Congress hates making such choices , of course , and would prefer not to . But to avoid choices , the Democrats will have to find more revenues , and that could mean t-a-x-e-s . Many Democrats know taxes are needed , but the party is paralyzed by fear . And that paralysis lets Bush win the tactical battle . This is a " Willie Horton " budget , a smart tactic for putting the opposition on the defensive . But there ' s more to government than that . Bush has squandered an opportunity to put his mark on the future.            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
