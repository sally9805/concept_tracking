For a plan that aims at a radical simplification of the Internal Revenue Code , Ronald Reagan 's tax reform seems remarkably complex . To explain it , the Treasury last week issued a paperback volume of 461 pages studded with charts and at times singularly opaque prose . Sample : " A customer of a contractor making progress payments or advance payments would be treated as self- constructing the property under construction by the contractor to the extent of such payments . " * <P> There are three main reasons for this Orwellian simple-is-befuddling approach . One is that the present tax code is such a hideous snarl . By Treasury count , under the new plan , " more than 65 categories of preferential tax treatment would be eliminated or curtailed . " Just describing what they are is no easy task . Another reason is that the plan is balanced on a knife edge to make it " revenue neutral . " To offset the sweeping reductions in individual and corporate tax rates , Treasury planners had to come up with some complicated revenue-raising ideas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had deducted under current depreciation rules . It was added just days before the package was announced largely because an extra $20 billion was needed to make the plan revenue neutral in 1988 . Finally , during the six months between the Treasury 's trial balloon last November and the formal presentation to Congress last week , the Administration listened to dozens of lobbyists contending , in the sardonic words of Treasury Secretary James Baker , that " if we go forward with a particular provision or another , it is the end of the Western world as we know it . " In the political interest of producing a plan with a fighting chance of becoming law , the Administration introduced complicated softenings of provisions that originally were straightforward and harsh . <P> Despite all that , the main thrust of <P> the Reagan plan is entirely clear . It would reverse a 20-year trend of tax cuts for business that has resulted in individuals shouldering a proportionally heavier load of the burden . The basic mechanism remains clear too : lowering rates but making more income taxable by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ design , though , there are hundreds of provisions varying widely in impact . Details : Individual rates . The move to a three-stage , 15%-25%-35% rate structure would by Administration calculations reduce taxes for 58.1% of all American families ; 21.2% would see no change except in the way that they compute what they owe , and 20.7% would pay more tax . Most families in every income group would get a reduction , but it would be greatest proportionally at the very bottom and the very top : 35.5% for families with incomes of less than $10,000 a year ; 10.7% for those enjoying incomes of $200,000 or more . Families in the upper middle class would get the smallest cut , an average of little more than 4% in the $50,000-to-$200,000 bracket . In the lower groupings , while the cuts would be larger in percentage , many will be quite modest in dollar amount . The Treasury estimates the average reduction for all taxpayers earning $50,000 a year or less would be about $200 a year .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
