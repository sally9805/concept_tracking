During his four years as White House deputy chief of staff , Michael Deaver was the protector and projector of Ronald 's and Nancy Reagan 's public images . He was the " Vicar of Visuals , " master of the carefully managed photo opportunities that became a hallmark of the Reagan Administration . Yet again and again in this intendedly affectionate memoir , he offers up intimate snapshots that undercut his previous handiwork . <P> Concerning the First Lady , whom Deaver describes as his best friend , he seems blind to an unseemly implication when he writes , " Nancy raised half a million dollars herself for the Joffrey Ballet , and ( ( Son ) ) Ron turned out to be one of its rising stars . " Despite Nancy 's attempts to downplay her influence on her husband 's decisions , Deaver confirms her role in the firings of James Watt and Donald Regan . <P> Deaver 's President is every bit the benignly self-assured , uncurious fellow portrayed by many less friendly observers . Deaver notes approvingly that Reagan was so fascinated by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that he " could diagnose a brain tumor just by hearing the symptoms on a soap opera . " On a soap opera ? <P> Other White House insiders also suffer from Deaver 's tributes . He describes Attorney General Edwin Meese as a man who would " as a matter of loyalty or conviction , sit there and deny something he knew to be true . " Vice President George Bush gets high marks for calling all over the U.S. to provide a fresh joke for the President 's daily briefing . <P> Deaver 's account of his perjury conviction in a case brought by an independent counsel draws some sympathy , but his chronicle of building a lobbying business around his old contacts shows little appreciation of the fine lines of ethics and propriety he crossed . His legal appeal is still in progress , but Behind the Scenes is a clear , if inadvertent , plea of guilt to charges of naivete.
