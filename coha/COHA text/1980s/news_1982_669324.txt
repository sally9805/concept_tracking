Their pilgrimage to America ' s track mecca symbolizes the reverence track athletes and fans hold for Eugene , a lumber and university town nestled in the southern part of Oregon ' s Willamette Valley. // Alberto Salazar , now the fastest marathon runner in history , chose Eugene as his home when he left high school in Wayland , Mass. , several years ago . He was the second fastest high school distance runner in America at that time , but when he arrived at the University of Oregon he found his dormitory roommate , Rudy Chapa of Indiana , had been the fastest. // Mary Decker Tabb left Boulder , Colo. , another running center , for Eugene over two years ago . Since then she met and married another world class runner , Ron Tabb - and during the last year she has set seven world records while establishing herself as America ' s top female runner at a variety of distances from 800 to 10 , 000 meters. // And now world record middle distance runners Sebastian Coe ( 3 : 47. 33 in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 36 in the 1 , 500 meters ) have chosen Eugene as the site of their first head-to-head confrontation in the mile . The Sept. 25 race between the two British superstars will be the centerpiece of the best track meet in America since June 5 , when Eugene put on the Prefontaine Classic at Hayward Field , site of the last three United States Olympic Trials. // How did a remote town of 104 , 000 become the track capital of the United States ? It began in 1904 , when Eugene was a much more remote town of 7 , 500 ; the University of Oregon hired Bill Hayward as track coach , and within two years Oregon had the first of its many world record holders , Dan Kelly in the 100-yard dash. // In 1932 Hayward was at the sidelines of an Oregon football game when a defensive back intercepted a pass and ran it back 95 yards along the sideline . As he ran , Hayward ran alongside him yelling , ' ' Lift up your knees , lift up your knees ! ' ' The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ track coach in 1948 . ' ' Bill Hayward taught me how to run , ' ' Bowerman says . ' ' More importantly , he taught me how to coach. ' ' // Bowerman is a living legend in the world of track . In 1950 he started the all-comers meets that have become a part of life in Eugene ever since , including world record and world class performances , such as Decker Tabb ' s. // Bowerman coached NCAA mile champions Bill Dellinger ( who succeeded Bowerman as Oregon ' s track coach in 1973 ) , Jim Bailey , Jim Grelle , and Dyrol Burleson and thus started Oregon ' s track dynasty , culminating in NCAA team championships in 1962 , ' 64 , ' 65 , and ' 70. // In 1962 Bowerman toured New Zealand with his world record four-mile relay team , and there he met Arthur Lydiard , the New Zealand Olympic coach . Lydiard had introduced the idea of jogging to the general populace , and it became a national pastime. // Bowerman decided to go out jogging with about 200 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' t keep up with the group and only a 76-year-old man stayed back with him out of courtesy , Bowerman realized he was out of shape. // When he got back to America Bowerman continued jogging , then started a program for the citizens of Eugene . The first time 25 people gathered on the Hayward Field track , the next week 50 showed up , then 100 . When Newsweek came to Eugene to write a story about jogging , word got out and 3 , 000 people showed up. // Bowerman wrote the book ' ' Jogging ' ' with W. E. Harris , M. D. , and a new word and phenomenon was introduced to America . The book has sold well over a million copies. // Bowerman had made shoes for his runners since the 1950s and one of his runners , Phillip Knight , started a shoe importing business with him in 1964 . In 1972 Bowerman ruined his wife ' s waffle iron inventing the now standard waffle sole running shoe . That same year he retired to go to work for the company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 46 percent of Nike ' s stock , Bowerman sold all but 2 percent . ' ' I ' ve never been interested in being a millionaire , ' ' the maverick Bowerman says . But with the company ' s revenues soaring about the $500 million mark , Bowerman can now afford his share of waffle irons. // A bigger thrill for Bowerman , however , was watching Steve Prefontaine run for the University of Oregon . Prefontaine led Oregon to the NCAA track championship in 1970 , and to NCAA cross-country championships in 1971 and 1973 . He also held the American records at every distance from 2 , 000 to 10 , 000 meters . But it was how he did it that made him legendary. // ' ' Prefontaine just went out and ran right up against the wall , ' ' says Kenny Moore , an Oregon runner who finished fourth in the 1972 Olympic marathon and has gone on to become one of America ' s leading track and field writers . ' ' Crowds reacted to that effort and then he reacted to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' // Bowerman recalls the 1972 US Olympic Trials , held at Hayward Field , home of the roaring ' ' Go Pre ! ' ' chant . Thousands of fans had ' Go Pre ! ' ' T-shirts , and rival Gerry Lindgren had some ' ' Stop Pre ' ' T-shirts made as a joke . Prefontaine won the 5 , 000 meter race to a deafening roar , and after his usual victory lap to sustained cheers , he ran into the stands , grabbed a ' ' Stop Pre ' ' T-shirt and made another victory lap wearing it to an even louder roar. // Prefontaine died in an automobile accident in Eugene in 1975 . This didn ' t make him a legend , he already had been one for years , and his example inspired Salazar and Chapa to come to Oregon in 1976 . Chapa became NCAA champion in the 5 , 000 meters , and heard chants of ' ' Rudy , Rudy , Rudy ' ' at Hayward Field to spur him on . Salazar led Oregon ' s cross-country team to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cross-country in 1978. // Chapa has been slowed by injuries and returned to Indiana to attend law school , while Salazar , of course , has become the world ' s best marathoner , winning his marathon debut in New York in 1980 , setting his world record 2 : 08. 13 a year later in the same race , then dramatically outrunning Dick Beardsley to win the Boston Marathon last April. // Bowerman is one of Alberto ' s biggest fans . ' ' He ' s highly intelligent and he ' s tough , ' ' Bowerman says . ' ' He ' s so tough that he runs beyond his physical capability . There isn ' t one man in a million who can push himself like that. ' ' // Salazar and his wife Molly , who holds several University of Oregon distance records , are expecting their first child this September . One can never tell , but if their child decides to become a runner , he ' ll feel right at home in Eugene. // //         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
