After a respite of barely a year , with the banality of the refrain still ringing in the ear , " the politics of the future " is back . When Gary Hart announced a fortnight ago that he would retire from the Senate ( to run , he all but admitted , for the presidency in 1988 ) , he could n't lay off the word . In a four-page statement , he reached for it eight times . In 1984 he had " pointed our party toward the future . " For ' 88 , he pledges " to help move our party and our country into the future . " Why ? Because even now " we are drifting backward into the future . " <P> This kind of talk is rhetorical emptiness at its most pristine . Why does Hart do it ? It 's not as if he has nothing to say . He has a host of important ideas . Whether or not they are new is irrelevant . A good idea is a good idea : military reform , national service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the superficial I-Love-Miss-Liberty kind now in vogue . ( Though , unfortunately , even here Hart can not resist defining patriotism as " more than slogans celebrating past achievements . It 's an opportunity to draw a blueprint for our future . " ) <P> This makes Hart a reformist liberal , a venerable , once honorable political label . Admittedly both ends of the term have poor p.r . value nowadays . Perhaps he does need a better handle . But what is the pull of the future ? It sounds good  --  for about ten minutes . Even in 1984 , voters quickly grew cynical about it and its companion , " new ideas . " <P> Still , even an empty notion can be pressed into political service . A liberal talking about the future is perhaps trying to distinguish himself from old-line , constituency-centered liberalism , what Kevin Phillips contemptuously calls " reactionary liberalism . " That might have served some purpose in 1984 . But what is the point now ? Carter and Mondale are no more . Kennedy is gone , and even he supports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Babbitt , Gephardt and Robb  --  neoliberals now . There are no paleoliberals left , unless Mario Cuomo 's principled disinclination to issue ostentatious rejections of the " past " tempts some to make the charge . <P> Talk of the future can also be code for saying , " I 'm young . " Old people , presumably , are simply not going to see the future . So if the job is to take us there , they are disqualified . But you ca n't say that without offending a rather important constituency . Future talk serves to muffle the message . <P> But the message continues to grate . It grated when John Kennedy , in his Inaugural Address , congratulated himself for being " born in this century , " a distinction Dwight Eisenhower lacked . It grates now when practitioners of " generational politics " imply that youth carries some special virtue . <P> Now one can say that the young are generally more energetic than the old , although Ronald Reagan and Deng Xiaoping have rendered even that proposition somewhat dubious . But the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the memory and experience of age . " New generation " politicians , unlike a Reagan or a Mondale , have no memory of the great transforming events of this century such as the Depression , World War II or postwar reconstruction . Only the peculiar arrogance of youth can make a virtue of that vice . That vice , of course , is no fault of the young , but it is hardly a great qualification for the challenges of the presidency .
