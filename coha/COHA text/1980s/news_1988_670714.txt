The action was viewed by highly placed agency officials as representing an important shift in Government strategy on how to insure the continuing safety of both 737 ' s and other airliners as they pile up flight hours beyond original expectations. // The F.A.A. said the proposed rule was needed because studies of the Aloha Airlines accident and the recent discovery of serious cracks on a Continental Airlines 737 showed that the current policy of repeated inspections could not insure continuing safety over the long run . <> <> Altitude Restrictions Imposed // " We are now saying it ' s time to fix design weaknesses rather than continuing to inspect for flaws , " said an F.A.A. official . " It is a fundamental shift in our way of operating. " // In a companion move to help assure safety until the structural changes are made , the agency issued a final rule imposing altitude restrictions on older 737 ' s . Those planes may fly no higher than 26 , 000 feet until maintenance crews carry out more stringent inspections than those previously required. // The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trouble-prone fuselage rivets on 100 or more early 737 ' s operated by airlines in the United States . This is only a small fraction of the total rivets on a 737. // The deadline for the changes would vary from six months to four years , depending on the number of flights each plane has made . The rule is expected to become final in about six weeks , with perhaps some modifications based on comments of airlines and other interested parties . <> <> Five Major Airlines Involved // The airlines operating most of the older 737 ' s in the United States are American , United , Piedmont , Continental and American West . The number of older 737 ' s operated by each airline was not immediately available. // Most foreign operators of 120 other older 737 ' s are expected to follow customary practice and comply with the rule voluntarily. // The F.A.A. estimated that it would require 2 , 016 hours of work to make the proposed changes . At $40 an hour per mechanic , that would exceed $80 , 000 a plane . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in mandatory repairs of other defects uncovered in the rivet-changing process would bring the total costs to much more. // The altitude restriction is related to the stresses on a fuselage as the cabin is pressurized after takeoff and depressurized before landing . The pressure is needed so that passengers can breath air like that near sea level as a plane climbs to the rarefied upper altitudes . But the repeated expansion and deflation ultimately lead to metal fatigue and cracking . These worsen when a plane , like the Aloha 737 , constantly flies routes near corrosive salt water . <> <> Other Actions Expected // Anthony J. Broderick , Associate Administrator of the F.A.A. , held out the prospect that the 737 policy shift would be extended to other models that started coming off the production lines 25 years ago . " This is the first major action in what is expected to be a series dealing with all types of aging airliners , " he said. // The official said the fuselage design of other older Boeing planes , like the Boeing 747 jumbo jet and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early-model 737 that has so dramatically showed its vulnerability to the aging process . But he added that the designs of the other planes differed in the thickness of the fuselage skins and in other significant details . <> <> Changes in Original Design // The Boeing Company itself recognized the imperfection of its original design in 1971 and changed the way the structure was built after the 291st plane came off the line. // The issue has to do with the method by which the 50 or so panels covering the fuselage are put together . The aluminum panels overlap like shingles on a roof , an upper panel over a lower panel . The two panels are bonded by an adhesive and also are attached to a long stringer , running from the front to the back of the fuselage , by three horizontal rows of rivets. // The problem with the first 291 planes was that the adhesive bonding was done at room temperature . Experience showed that the bonding had a tendency to delaminate , or pull apart , as a plane built up flying time. // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The trouble with the rivets was that they were the " flush " variety , which created a knifelike edge that generated cracks as two overlapping skin panels moved slightly . Under the proposed new rule , the top row of flush rivets will be replaced by " buttonhead " rivets that have a protruding head and present no knife-edge hazard . Other rows may be changed later . <> <> A Hot-Bonding Procedure // More than 1 , 500 Boeing 737 ' s have been delivered to airlines . After the 291st was made , Boeing switched from room-temperature bonding of the adhesive to a hot-bonding procedure . That was better but not perfect . Another switch was made to an improved hot-bonding technique after the 464th plane . No significant cracking or disbonding has been reported in 737 ' s produced since then. // Long before the Aloha accident last April 28 , the Government and Boeing had become increasingly worried about the aging process on the older 737 ' s because of significant cracks that were turning up. // The problem was addressed in Boeing recommendations and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , corrosion and disbonding , and for repairs . The Aloha accident lifted the problem to a new level of urgency. // The 19-year-old plane , which had made nearly 90 , 000 flights ( more than all but one other 737 in service ) , was cruising at 24 , 000 feet from Hilo , Hawaii , to Honolulu when an 18-foot section of the upper forward fuselage ripped away . A flight attendant was swept to her death and 6 of the other 95 people on board were injured as the twin-jet plane limped to an emergency landing on the island of Maui . <> <> Electronic Inspection Urged // In June , a seminar in Washington raised questions about excessive reliance on inspection and repair . Experts pointed to the fallibility of humans trying to check literally thousands of rivets and to the danger of layers of paint covering the defects. // Meanwhile , the aviation agency proposed rules calling for greater use of electronic , rather than visual , inspections . It also called for the changing of rivets but did not require it before a plane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proposal , planes that have made 70 , 000 or more landings must make the change within six months . Planes with 60 , 000 to 70 , 000 landings must do the work within 12 months . Planes with fewer than 40 , 000 landings will have three years to do it. // The final catalyst for the tough new F.A.A. rule was the discovery this month of a series of cracks 30 inches long on a 19-year-old Continental plane . The cracks were found in a routine repainting job . Under the final rule announced yesterday , paint will have to be stripped for inspections if there are more than two layers. //
