Their 18-day voyage to south Florida on a small , rickety boat last July ended with their detention by the United States Government . For 11 months , they were held at the Krome Center here while politicians and Federal agencies considered whether they and nearly 15 , 000 other Haitian refugees should be allowed to stay in this country. // Nearly a year ago they were freed from detention . The time since has been marked by joblessness , poverty , substandard housing and a constant worry over whether they will eventually be sent back. // " I ' m free to walk the streets ; that ' s all the freedom I have , " said Mr. St. Gilles as his wife nodded in agreement . A masonry contractor in Haiti , he said he could not find work here . <> <> Children Left Behind // " I can ' t eat , " he said . " I ' m constantly thinking about my children . " All nine were left behind , the couple said , in their flight from Haiti . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public statements about police conduct. // Many Haitians , both longtime residents and those who came in boatlifts over the past 10 years , say that the search in America for a better life is being increasingly frustrated by a hardening policy of official rejection and by a public rejection that overwhelms gestures of acceptance. // The Government ' s rejection is reflected in its policy of detention for undocumented Haitian arrivals . It argues that most are fleeing for economic , not political , reasons , and are therefore ineligible for asylum . Until a year ago , when two Federal courts ruled the policy illegal , the Government kept several thousand Haitians behind the high barbed wire fences of the Krome detention center. // The Coast Guard still turns back Haitian refugees at sea . And the court order only affected those already detained , so more than 100 recent arrivals , some barely teen-aged , are at Krome . <> <> Many Won ' t Hire Haitians // The public rejection shows itself in the refusal of many non-Haitian employers to hire the refugees and in the limited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the city . Part of the problem is that many of the Haitians , who speak Creole , have not yet learned English or Spanish and that employers are reluctant to hire someone who might be deported any day. // But many Haitians contend that equally significant reasons are public impressions that they are lazy and unproductive , and , more recently , that they are public health risks as victims of acquired immunity deficiency syndrome , or AIDS. // " It ' s getting rough , getting rough , " said the Rev. Gerard Jean-Juste , the Catholic priest who heads the Haitian Refugee Center Inc. here . " And those who did not like the Haitians have found a new element . They are saying they do not want Haitians here because they are AIDS carriers . " <> <> ' Where Is the Hope ? ' // " It ' s getting more and more complex , " he added . " On one side , Haitians can not leave Haiti , where the situation is getting worse , because the Coast Guard has the island surrounded and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting worse. // " It ' s a matter of hope . Where is the hope for the Haitian people ? " Silvia Gonzalez , a consultant who served as Miami director of the Government ' s Cuban-Haitian Task Force in 1981 , shared that view . " The odds are against them all around : health , education , the American attitude that they are a burden , " she said . " It ' s a lack of understanding of what their situation is , and it ' s more our problem as Americans than theirs. " // Middle-class Haitians began fleeing their Caribbean homeland increasingly in the early 1960 ' s , telling of political repression . Most settled legally around New York and Miami and today constitute the core of the Haitian-American business community . <> <> Shift in Migration Pattern // The migration pattern shifted around 1972 , however , amid another wave of assertions of political injustice . The Federal Government estimates that between 40 , 000 and 50 , 000 Haitians have since entered the country illegally , usually on small , rickety boats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have requested political asylum , but the Government has resisted because the United States does not officially acknowledge the existence of political repression in Haiti. // The Haitian boat people , as they were called , were catapulted into the national spotlight in 1980 when some 15 , 000 began arriving in south Florida on the heels of the larger Cuban refugee boatlift . The number shrank to 8 , 000 in 1981 and 134 in 1982 as the Government imposed detention on land and interdiction at sea. // The 1980 census found 90 , 000 people who said one or both parents were of Haitian ancestry , and the Immigration and Naturalization Service estimates that there are probably an equal number of Haitians here illegally . An agency official said 40 , 000 Haitians have entered the country illegally since 1972 . <> <> Plight Is Examined // Here in Dade County , where the Haitian population is estimated by the county ' s planning agency at 50 , 000 to 60 , 000 people , the plight of Haitians was illustrated in several recent reports. // One such survey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Coral Gables estimated that 22 , 800 Haitians reside in the Edison-Little River community , which includes Little Haiti . The survey concluded that Haitians there " face substantial problems. " // Half were unemployed , half could not converse in English and twothirds had a household income of less than $150 a week . " They live in crowded , deteriorating housing , but pay high monthly rent , " the study said , a finding substantiated first-hand by the St. Gilleses , who pay $175 a month for a two-room apartment in a building infested with rats and roaches . <> <> Tradition of Self-Sufficiency // Despite the high unemployment rate among Haitians , four times the county ' s , the study noted that there was no greater dependency upon public agencies for assistance among Haitians than other groups . This reflects the strong desire among many Haitians to be self-sufficient rather than depend on agencies for help , several social service organizations ' officials said. // Not all the news for the Haitians has been bad , however . Early this spring , the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Government had violated the constitutional rights of some 1 , 700 Haitian refugees . In what immigration lawyers called a landmark ruling , the court held that the Government erred by detaining the refugees at Krome , failing to advise them that they could apply for political asylum and failing to allow them access to lawyers. // But then dozens of Haitians seeking to flee their country by boat were caught by the Coast Guard and sent back . And dozens more who made it to the Florida coast were apprehended and detained at Krome. // In early June , word reached Miami that Fred ' s Barn Market , a store that served the banking needs of migrant farm workers in the rural town of Immokalee , 75 miles northwest of here , had declared bankruptcy . Some $200 , 000 of the money on deposit was suddenly inaccessible . Many of the depositors were Haitian farm workers , trying to raise money to feed themselves and send what extra cash they had to relatives . <> <> AIDS Stigma Called Unfair // Now the community is upset over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ victims of AIDS are Haitian . Of the 1 , 641 AIDS cases reported in the United States as of June 20 by the Federal Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta , 5 percent were Haitian . Another 6 percent were classified as not fitting into the four named high-risk groups : men with frequent and varied homosexual contacts , intravenous drug users , hemophiliacs needing many transfusions and Haitians. // " They have blown this thing out of proportion so much that there ' s no other reason for it than to indicate a subtle form of racism , " said Roger Biamby , executive director of the Haitian-American Community Association of Dade . " There ' s nothing new in this game . It ' s just a political game that ' s being played . " <> <> Doctors Pose Conditions // Some Haitian physicians here and in New York have said they will advise their patients to refuse to cooperate with medical researchers , including the Centers for Disease Control , unless Haitian medical scientists play major roles in research. // " The mass media has put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Desgranges , a member of the New York branch of the Haitian Physicians Association and chairman of its AIDS committee . " To say that simply being Haitian is a risk factor is a premature conclusion. " // Dr. Caroline MacLeod , a tropical disease specialist , said the Haitians may have been unfairly singled out but that it was important to identify those who suffer from the disease . At a recent meeting of Haitian physicians who gathered here to discuss the AIDS situation , she told them that she felt Haitians " would be vindicated because it ' s going to be found in all other Caribbean countries . We think it ' s a tropical disease syndrome , basically . " <> <> The Search for Employment // The debate over AIDS has had little direct impact on Haitians ' employment opportunities , however , job placement officers at several agencies say . At worst , it has added just one more wrinkle to a tough challenge. // Jean-Baptiste Obas , a job placement officer with the Haitian Community Action Association , said there had been one or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not being hired for fear of the disease , but he said it was difficult to tell why the most recent refugees do or do not get a job. // " Some find work , " he said . " They do domestic work , housekeeping , farm work or in factories because they came here used to working the assembly lines in Haiti. " // More often than not , he said , they are able to find only the lowest paying jobs in the service industries , mainly because of the language barrier . <> <> Some Workers Risk Expulsion // Many of the recent Haitian refugees , feeling as if they have exhausted their prospects here , drift away . Often they head north to seek work , at the risk of missing their immigration hearings and being deported. // Even migrant work is not steady , though , said 33-year-old Jean Gingy Joseph . Mr. Joseph , a member of the military in Haiti for 18 months , is one of the few Haitian refugees of the 1980 ' s to be granted political asylum. // He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their annual trek through the farmlands to harvest food by hand . This week he was in North Carolina picking cucumbers . He is paid 35 cents for a bucket of 50. // He has worked only about 15 days , he told inquirers . He lives in a four-room dwelling with 10 other people . What keeps him going , he said , is his desire to prepare financially for what he hopes is the day his wife is able to leave Haiti in search of freedom and work in America. //
