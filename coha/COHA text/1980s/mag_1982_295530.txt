Periodically TIME presents its readers with an advance look at the memoirs of famous men . Excerpts first appeared in TIME from such works as Soviet Chairman Nikita Khrushchev 's Khrushchev Remembers : The Last Testament ( 1974 ) , Anwar Sadat 's In Search of Identity ( 1978 ) , and former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger 's White House Years ( 1979 ) and Years of Upheaval ( 1982 ) . In this issue , TIME offers Part 1 of a two-part serialization of Jimmy Carter 's Keeping Faith , the former President 's personal account of his years in the Oval Office . <P> This week 's excerpts tell of the President 's hopes and fears through the dramatic 13 days at Camp David that resulted in the Israeli-Egyptian peace treaty . Next week , Carter writes of the 444 days that tore at the very roots of his presidency-the period in which America 's hostages were held in Iran . <P> Included in this week 's cover story is an exclusive interview with Carter conducted in Plains , Ga. , by Assistant Managing Editor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book , and Chicago Bureau Chief Chris Ogden . TIME 'S White House and State Department correspondent during the Carter Administration , Ogden prepped for the interview by renewing old contacts with former Carter aides and reviewing stories and his own yellowing notes . Recalls Ogden : " Carter is not a politician in the traditional sense who feels compelled to put up a false friendly front . While gracious , he was , as usual , all business . " When the four-hour interview was over , Carter said : " TIME wrote some tough stories about me in the past , but I 'm really happy you 're publishing me . In TIME my book will reach the largest potential worldwide readership . " <P> The excerpting of Keeping Faith was done by Senior Writer Ed Magnuson , whose 90 cover stories over 20 years include three on the Iran hostage crisis . Says Magnuson : " A President 's recollections are a matter of history , so we were exceedingly concerned about not taking anything out of context . " <P> Helping Magnuson in the task was Reporter-Researcher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Kissinger excerpts . " I was struck by the timeliness of what the President said in Keeping Faith " says Chiu . Just as Author Carter is pleased to have his work in TIME , we are sure TIME 'S readers will be pleased to find it here .
