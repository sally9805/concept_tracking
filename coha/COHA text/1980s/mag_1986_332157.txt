When the Navy decided to bring back the battleship five years ago , old hands could almost be heard humming Anchors Aweigh . Since then , two World War II- vintage battlewagons have been made ready for sea duty , and last week a third , the U.S.S. Missouri , was recommissioned in San Francisco as a crowd of 12,000 spectators cheered from its pier . <P> But no dreadnought is really shipshape , it seems , without a set of ceremonial silver . When the Missouri was mothballed back in 1955 , ten years after the surrender ceremony ending World War II was held on her decks as she lay at anchor in Tokyo Bay , 338-piece silver set was returned to the citizens of Missouri , who had generously donated the finery . With the Missouri returning to action , the Navy wanted the silver back . Problem was , Missouri Governor John Ashcroft wanted to hang on to the ship 's engraved punch-bowl set , which has been on display at the state capital in Jefferson City . Finally , with the U.S. Attorney in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state compromised : when the Missouri is at sea , all the silver is hers . But when she is in home port , the Navy will make the punch bowl available to the state . Grog all around , mates .
