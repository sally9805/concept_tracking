The Meese investigation puts the Reagan Administration under a cloud <P> The turnabout was startling . A mere four weeks ago , Presidential Counsellor Edwin Meese , self-assured and articulate , fended off hostile questions from Democratic Senators at his confirmation hearings and emerged confident that he would quickly become Attorney General of the U.S. But last week a Justice Department investigation into his tangled finances was under way , the press was nipping at his heels , and Meese , first bewildered and then combative , was asking that a special prosecutor be appointed to investigate " the misrepresentations and baseless charges " against him . The probe could take months , delaying and possibly dooming his confirmation . <P> There was more at stake in the Washington drama than the personal fate of Meese , a 17-year intimate of Ronald Reagan 's and until recently one of his most influential aides . Even if found by a special prosecutor to have committed no crime , Meese will still face congressional opposition for accepting financial help from men who were later appointed to federal positions . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was involved in and anybody getting a job at any time , " Meese insisted . Nonetheless , there was still an appearance of impropriety . Meese 's missteps intensified the aura of ethical laxity that has clung to the Reagan Administration from its earliest days . The cumulative impact of questionable dealings and pressured resignations by Reagan appointees has not seemed to hurt the President . But as the November election approaches , the Democrats are certain to portray Reagan as unduly tolerant of misfeasance by his underlings . <P> Political considerations were , in fact , uppermost in the minds of White House strategists and Reagan 's Senate allies last week as they grappled with Meese 's deteriorating situation . The relatively routine confirmation was derailed when the Washington Post disclosed that the nominee had failed to report a $15,000 interest-free loan from a California friend , Edwin <P> W. Thomas , to Meese 's wife Ursula ; the 1978 Ethics in Government Act requires that any official paid more than $60,000 must list all such loans in financial-disclosure statements . Even Strom Thurmond , the Republican chairman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other witnesses should be called to face more questioning . Declared Thurmond : " There will be no cover-up . " <P> Although Meese had called the omission of the loan " inadvertent , " his error posed a dilemma for Attorney General William French Smith , a Meese friend who wants to retire in time to help Reagan campaign for reelection . The Justice Department was prosecuting Republican Congressman George Hansen of Idaho for failing to include loans to his wife on the disclosure forms required of members of Congress . The Hansen loans from Texas Billionaire Nelson Bunker Hunt were larger than Meese 's ( the largest was $62,000 ) , and Hansen refuses to file amended forms . Meese has readily done so , but that might not be enough to save him . With Hansen on trial last week , Smith would have been criticized if he had not ordered an investigation into Meese 's omission .
