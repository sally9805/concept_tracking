In a foreign-aid budget of about $15 billion , the sum is minuscule , a mere $14 million . But the Administration 's efforts to persuade Congress to support the contras in Nicaragua is turning into a major foreign policy test . The Administration stepped up its pressure on Congress last week . An unidentified Administration official hinted that if the funds were not provided directly , aid to the anti-Sandinista rebels might be supplied by unnamed Asian countries . He did not explain whether those countries would simply pass along U.S. money or use their own funds to help the contras . Congress might forbid any rerouting of support meant for such friendly nations as Thailand and Taiwan , but a country could , of course , use the U.S. funds for internal purposes and then earmark an equal amount from its own budget for the contras . Congress would then have the option of cutting off or restricting aid to the offending country . <P> Another alternative alluded to by Administration sources was to recognize the contras as a government-in-exile and funding them openly rather than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be risky , since it would be " tantamount to a declaration of war . " Still another option floated by Government officials is getting Congress to approve " humanitarian aid " to support the contras ' families , many of whom live in Honduras and Guatemala , with the expectation that the money would be passed on to the fighting men . Again , Congress would probably be opposed to such a sleight-of-hand funding . The President , however , might be able to provide this family aid out of emergency funds under his control . <P> In a more direct effort to squeeze the Nicaraguan government , the U.S. has opposed a proposal by the Inter-American Development Bank , a lending institution supported by 43 nations , to grant a $58 million loan to that country . Secretary of State George Shultz personally expressed " strong opposition " to the loan , claiming that it would enable the Sandinistas to " free other money that could be used to help consolidate the Marxist regime and finance Nicaragua 's aggression against its neighbors .

Americas Watch , a private nonpartisan group that monitors human-rights abuses in the hemisphere , contended that the Nicaraguan Democratic Force , the largest rebel group , employs " the deliberate use of terror . " The Washington Office on Latin America , a coalition of religious and academic groups , issued a report citing at least 28 murders , rapes , assaults and instances of torture committed by the contras . <P> Asked about the reports by a Senate committee , Shultz replied , " I do n't say there are n't any problems , but it always strikes me how when there 's a sense here or in Nicaragua that we 're coming up to a vote or a decision , that all sorts of stuff starts appearing . " The vote on the $14 million will be in the form of separate House and Senate resolutions and is expected in April .
