Greeted with flowers at Chicago 's O'Hare airport , Katerina ( " Katya " ) Lycheva , 11 , smiled and said in her careful English , " I am very glad to see you , and I think we will be friends . " For the next two weeks , Katya 's mission is to meet American children " and tell them as much as I can about the Soviet Union . " Sponsored by the San Francisco-based Children of the Peacemakers , her visit was inspired by a similar 1983 trip to the U.S.S.R. by Maine Schoolgirl Samantha Smith , who died last summer in a plane crash and has become a hero in the Soviet Union . Katya , who has acted in a young people 's theater group back home in Moscow , plans to see the Statue of Liberty , Disneyland , NASA 's Houston space center , and Ronald McDonald . Though she brought a gift for him , the more important Ronald is not scheduled to see her .             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
