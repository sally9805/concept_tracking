A First Lady rides the roller coaster of her husband 's politics , takes the buffeting of uncontrollable world events and suffers the brickbats of detractors in frustrated silence . She is damned if she tries to influence policy and damned if she does n't . In some ways , her job is tougher than the President 's . <P> We have been served well in these past years by our First Ladies , each with her own style and goals . John Kennedy acknowledged that his wife could be difficult . Jackie Kennedy sometimes spent too much money , and her moods were mercurial . She loved the power , but hated the fishbowl life , once even thumbing her nose at tourists . But she had an idea : to make the White House a living museum . She planted that idea , and it flourishes today . She furnished the class we came to call Camelot . The Kennedy men too often were boors . <P> If any First Lady paid heavy dues it was Pat Nixon . Now out of sight and in fragile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her White House years . She took on Mrs. Kennedy 's idea and enriched the public rooms more than any other First Lady . Her achievements were lost in the black hole of Watergate . Even in that grim episode , there was something admirable about her . She kept the dignity of her office , neither condoning the events nor deserting her husband . <P> Off on her own , Pat Nixon seemed more at ease , almost liberated . When she went on a good-will tour to Liberia in 1972 , her personality changed almost as soon as her plane crossed the continental shelf . She glowed , laughed and lofted tiny barbs of irreverence . When native dancers appeared barebreasted , White House aides were aghast . But she watched admiringly and applauded . TIME 's Bonnie Angelo , who accompanied Mrs. Nixon , recalled last week , " I saw Pat Ryan , the pretty schoolteacher from Whittier , Calif. , emerge from another era and flower for a few precious days . " <P> Betty Ford 's irrepressible honesty startled the nation . She was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her children got mixed up in the naughtiness of the era . Mrs. Ford said she did not approve of premarital sex but would not be surprised if it happened in her family . When breast cancer struck , she became the world 's gentle tutor on how to face down the tragedy . The price of public life was a dangerous dependence on alcohol and medication . After leaving the White House , she bravely took the cure . A woman who neither wanted nor sought the world stage , she faltered before her audience , righted herself and won acclaim . <P> Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter were a couple with shared goals , philosophies , values , tastes and , once a week , on the presidential schedule , a working lunch . Some say she should have been President because she was more realistic about the world than her husband was . There is little doubt that she was the President 's No. 1 adviser , confidante and source of encouragement .                 @ @ @ @
