Perils and opportunity in the wake of the Israeli invasion <P> As U.S. Negotiator Philip Habib continued his peace efforts last week after Israel 's furious bombardments of West Beirut , the precise nature of a settlement still remained uncertain . But one thing was clear : Israel 's ten-week-old invasion of Lebanon had wrought momentous changes in the complex Middle East equation , and their repercussions would be felt for years to come . Every major actor in the drama has been deeply affected . For the U.S. , the crisis provoked by its headstrong Israeli ally has presented grave risks but also a challenging opportunity to play a key role in forging a comprehensive Middle East peace . <P> To a large degree , the chances for such a peace depend on the future of the P.L.O . The Israeli strategy , as directed by Defense Minister Ariel Sharon , called for crushing all P.L.O . military and political influence . Indeed many Israeli observers were ready last week to declare the P.L.O . dead and buried even before the guerrillas evacuated Beirut . <P> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Issam Sartawi , an adviser to P.L.O . Chief Yasser Arafat , puts it : " We have learned the hard way how to transfer our military battle into a political victory . Regardless of what happens in Beirut , we shall get out of it stronger than we were . " There was doubtless a strong measure of wishful thinking in that assessment , but many observers felt that the P.L.O . might realize political and diplomatic gains that the Israelis had hardly intended to promote when they stormed across the Lebanese border on June 6 . Said Harvard University Professor Stanley Hoffmann : " The P.L.O . is politically better off than ever before . " <P> The outgunned Palestinians could boast that they had made a credible showing by resisting the Israelis inch by inch once the battle took to the streets of Beirut . By contrast , the combined armies of Syria , Jordan and Egypt crumbled before the Israelis after only six days in 1967 . The siege has therefore boosted the popular stock of the P.L.O . in the Arab world . Although most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . cut down to size militarily in the early phases of the invasion , none desired an outright defeat . In the past month , there has been a grudging resurgence of Arab support , if for no other reason than self-interest : the Palestinian issue has long been a litmus test of Arab nationalism , and no regime that wishes to stay in power can afford to ignore it . <P> Some experts on the Middle East see the possibility of serious Palestinian reprisals against the Arab nations for their failure to aid the P.L.O . earlier . Warns the P.L.O . ' s Sartawi : " The Palestinians will not easily forget the extent to which they were deserted on this occasion . " It was partly to assuage such bitterness that the Syrians last week reversed themselves and agreed to accept some of the P.L.O . guerrillas from Lebanon . ( Other countries willing to take in the P.L.O. : Jordan , Iraq , Tunisia , Algeria , North Yemen , South Yemen and the Sudan. )            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
