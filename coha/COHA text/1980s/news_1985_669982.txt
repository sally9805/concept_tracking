The vice president of a major American company fondly recalls the devotion he once brought to his job . " I would have walked on hot coals for this company , " he asserts . As proof , he says he once left a hospital bed to return to work . Today , he calls in sick . " It doesn ' t seem to matter . It ' s almost as though I ' m reporting to a machine , " he says , referring to the company that eight years ago bought the subsidiary for which he works . Nor is his disaffection isolated . Of the roughly 100 people he supervises , the 51-year-old vice president knows of at least eight who are searching for employment elsewhere  --  including himself . " I ' m doing nothing to discourage them , " says the executive , whose annual salary exceeds $70 , 000 . " I can ' t instill in them a false sense of loyalty I myself don ' t have . " Loyalty  --  that intangible yet indispensable asset  --  is waning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficult to measure , but surveys , anecdotal evidence and interviews with executives across the country indicate that many managers and workers who once devoted all their energies to their jobs are now concluding that such devotion was misplaced . Business consultants and psychologists cite several reasons for the change . Younger workers , who are generally better educated , have higher expectations about their jobs and are more likely to feel dissatisfied when their ambitions aren ' t met . Moreover , a wave of mergers and corporate cutbacks , which has resulted in a net reduction of nearly 500 , 000 managerial and professional jobs since 1979 , has convinced many workers that companies won ' t return their loyalty . As a result , many employees ' first loyalties are now to their families and personal lives rather than the company . " The womb-to-tomb concept is dead , " says Harry Levinson , a corporate consultant and industrial psychologist at Harvard University . " People used to be able to count on the organization and its stability . But the myth that institutions will take care of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ implications for employers . It may manifest itself in relatively minor personnel matters , such as an employee ' s refusal to relocate . Or it may result in an employee ' s departure , now estimated to cost a company as much as $65 , 000 in the case of a middle manager . Some industries have widespread , almost epidemic , defection . In California ' s Silicon Valley , employee turnover at 231 electronics companies averaged 27% last year , one survey found , more than five times the departure rate for all U.S. manufacturing . Such defections are spreading to companies that once had ironclad loyalty . Since the breakup of the Bell System , annual turnover at American Telephone &; Telegraph Co. has more than tripled to 13% . When Du Pont Co. offered a generous early-retirement plan to its 113 , 000 domestic employees earlier this year , the chemical giant was overwhelmed : 11 , 200 elected to leave , or about twice as many as the company had expected . Disaffected employees who are unable or unwilling to leave may find other ways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guilty of " lowballing , " the term U.S. Steel Corp . Vice Chairman Thomas C. Graham used to describe the modest management goals he found in 1983 when he took charge of the company ' s then-faltering steel operations . The disaffected manager may submit reports late , raise irrelevant issues at meetings or even withhold important information . Such an employee might also resort to fraud , theft or other dishonest activities . Plitt Theaters Inc. has seen absenteeism among salaried employees rise 30% since the theater chain imposed wage and benefit austerity two years ago , says internal auditor Jack Buscemi . He concedes that the cost of the absenteeism may have offset the savings of the austerity program . " When someone gets embedded in their mind that they are not being treated fairly , then they look for ways to strike back , " says James Walls , a marketing vice president at Stanton Corp. , which administers so-called " honesty " tests for corporate clients . Citing years of test results , he concludes : " There ' s absolutely no doubt that corporate loyalty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " In 1968 , for example , only 1% of employment applicants screened by Stanton said they would search for ways to cheat their employer ; today , 7% would do so . As a result , nearly one-third of all prospective employees that Stanton screens are judged " high-risk , " up from 13% in 1964 . Other studies have found that job satisfaction for all employees , regardless of rank , is lower today than it has ever been . The erosion of worker loyalty reflects broad social trends . Mr. Walls believes that cynicism about the workplace is widespread among younger workers because they were raised in a more permissive society , one where confidence in such basic institutions as marriage and government has deteriorated . In high-technology work in particular , younger employees appear to show greater loyalty to their technology than their employer . And when their work isn ' t a corporate priority , " the employee can easily become disenchanted , " says E. John Keller , a security consultant at Arthur Andersen &; Co. , the accounting firm . Two years ago , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman to upgrade its computer system . She was given a hefty salary , a title and a small staff to supervise . Now , she says of the project , " I don ' t care if it flops . " The 37-year-old executive , who recently quit her job , admits she spent the last few months at work " doing absolutely nothing . " The woman , who asked not to be identified , says she originally thought the firm was interested in her project . " I could have stayed and collected a paycheck , but it was senseless for me to waste my time , " she says . " They gave me no indication that they were committed to my work . " Frustrated workers are also putting their personal lives ahead of their jobs . One sign : Increasing numbers of managers are refusing to relocate . Such executives are giving more consideration to the financial burdens of such a move , a spouse ' s career , or , simply the value of their community . David DeMuch , for example , began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Corp . The 42-year-old father of three chased success hard , moving his family seven times in just eight years . " I had different priorities then , " says Mr. DeMuch , who now runs Harris Corp. ' s Cleveland office , selling electronics equipment . " Harris is a great company , but I have higher loyalties now , " says the Cleveland native , citing his family and their network of friends and social activities . Mr. DeMuch , who makes $83 , 000 a year , has told Harris that he won ' t move again . " If they insist , " he says , " I ' ll resign . " The recessions and corporate upheavals of recent years have probably done more than anything to shatter employee loyalty . In an era of takeovers , mergers and layoffs , thousands of workers have discovered that years of service mean little to a struggling management or a new corporate parent . " Around here , we refer to a guy who brings his lunch on Friday as an optimist , " says a manager at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staff since 1982 , eliminating 16 , 500 jobs . Companies counter that today ' s competitive business environment makes it difficult to protect workers . Indeed , some companies see the overly loyal employee as a detriment : someone who shuns risk , blindly follows corporate policies and refrains from expressing himself . " Companies now are saying to their employees , ' We ' ll take care of you as long as we ' re winning . ' That ' s a tremendous shift from the old paternalistic system , " says Noel Tichy , a consultant and professor at the University of Michigan ' s graduate business school . It also involves considerable risk , he adds . " You ' ve got this paradox of eliminating people and , at the same time , retaining commitment among those who remain . It ' s a tough problem . " Beatrice Cos. , for example , has undergone a major transformation in the past six years under Chairman James L. Dutt , selling scores of businesses , consolidating others and acquiring giant Esmark Inc. last year for $2. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disaffection at Beatrice , a Chicago-based food and consumer-products company . Thirty of Beatrice ' s 38 top operating officials have either been fired or voluntarily departed since Mr. Dutt took over , not including the departure of dozens of senior Esmark employees . " There is such mass disloyalty here it ' s almost scary , " says a high-ranking Beatrice manager , who expects additional management defections . A Beatrice spokesman says there has been some " pain and dislocation " at the company , but denies there is any widespread disaffection . Managing turmoil isn ' t a problem at IBM , which began its " full-employment " practice in the Depression and hasn ' t laid off anyone for economic reasons in more than 50 years . The computer giant is widely regarded to have loyalty so intense that many observers liken it to a religious order or the military . How does IBM engender such loyalty ? " They start the commitment process by carefully screening who they let in the door , " says Richard Pascale , a professor at Stanford University business school . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , will be quizzed extensively about their values  --  and whether they accept the commitments to excellence , quality and the individual that the company has preached since the 1920s . " You have to buy into our beliefs to work here , " says Edward Krieg , director of management development . A company like IBM that has clear values  --  and a workforce that shares those precepts  --  is more likely to have a higher level of commitment , Mr. Pascale believes . " People who work try to rationalize why they do it , " he says . " If a company can tap into your personal values , you ' ll be more willing to give that extra ounce of effort . " The vice president of the major company cited earlier no doubt would agree . He remembers when his employer once had company picnics and Christmas parties . Layoffs didn ' t exist . The owners were on the premises daily . Achievement was recognized and rewarded . Now , eight years after the family sold out to the corporate parent , when a vacancy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Representatives from headquarters seldom visit . When business sours , workers are the first to go . They return the courtesy  --  as many as 30 now call in sick on a Monday , the executive says , compared with maybe two before . The picnics and parties are gone . So , too , is the commitment employees once felt . " There was a time when the workers here felt like family , " the vice president laments . " Now we ' re all just numbers .
