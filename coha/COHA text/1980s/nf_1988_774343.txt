They lift your heels and they say , You got too many onions . ' It 's portion control . " " Is there any freedom anywhere in the process ? " I asked . " Lettuce . They 'll leave you alone as long as it 's neat . " " So lettuce is freedom ; pickles is judgment ? " " Yeah but you do n't have time to play around with your pickles . They 're never gon na say just six pickles except on the disk . Each store has video disks to train the crew for each of about twenty work stations , like fries , register , lobby , quarterpounder grill . What you 'll hear in real life is twelve and six on a turn-lay . ' The first number is your hamburgers , the second is your Big Macs . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you put down the second batch after you turn the first . So you got twenty-four burgers on the grill , in shifts . It 's what they call a production mode . And remember you also got your fillets , your McNuggets .... " " Wait , slow down . " By then I was losing track of the patties on our imaginary grill . " I do n't understand this turn-lay thing . " " Do n't worry , you do n't have to understand . You follow the beepers , you follow the buzzers and you turn your meat as fast as you can . It 's like I told you , to work at McDonald 's you do n't need a face , you do n't need a brain . You need to have two hands and two legs and move ' em as fast as you can . That 's the whole system . I would n't go back there again for anything . " McDonald 's french fries are deservedly the pride of their menu ; uniformly golden brown all across America and in  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standardize the number of fries per serving . The McDonald 's fry scoop , perhaps their greatest technological innovation , helps to control this variable . The unique flat funnel holds the bag open while it aligns a limited number of fries so that they fall into the package with a paradoxically free , overflowing cornucopia look . Despite the scoop , there 's still a spread . The acceptable fry yield is 400 to 420 servings per 100-lb. bag of potatoes . It 's one of the few areas of McDonald 's cookery in which such a range is possible . The fry yield is therefore one important measure of a manager 's efficiency . " Fluffy , not stuffy , " they remind the young workers when the fry yield is running low . No such variation is possible in the browning of the fries . Early in McDonald 's history Louis Martino , the husband of the secretary of McDonald 's founder Ray Kroc , designed a computer to be submerged in the fry vats . In his autobiography , Grinding It Out , Kroc explained the importance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . that called for pulling the potatoes out of the oil when they got a certain color and grease bubbles formed in a certain way . It was amazing that we got them as uniform as we did because each kid working the fry vats would have his own interpretation of the proper color and so forth . The word " kid " was officially replaced by " person " or " crew person " in McDonald 's management vocabulary in 1973 in response to union organizing attempts . Louis 's computer took all the guesswork out of it , modifying the frying to suit the balance of water to solids in a given batch of potatoes . He also engineered the dispenser that allowed us to squirt exactly the right amount of catsup and mustard onto our premeasured hamburger patties .... " The fry vat probe is a complex miniature computer . The fry scoop , on the other hand , is as simple and almost as elegant as the wheel . Both eliminate the need for a human being to make " his own interpretation , " as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ innovations mean that a new worker can be trained in fifteen minutes and reach maximum efficiency in a half hour . This makes it economically feasible to use a kid for one day and replace him with another kid the next day . June Sanders worked at McDonald 's for one day . " I needed money , so I went in and the manager told me my hours would be 4 to 10 r.M . " This was fine with June , a wellorganized black woman in her early twenties who goes to college full time . " But when I came in the next day the manager said I could work till 10 for that one day . But from then on my hours would be 4 P.M. to 1 A.M. And I really would n't get off at 1 because I 'd have to stay to clean up after they closed . . . . Yes it was the same manager , a Mr. O'Neil . " I told him I 'd have to check first with my family if I could come home that late . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out the forms . He would start me out on french fries . " Then he showed me an orientation film on a TV screen all about fries . . . . No , I still had n't punched in . This was all in the basement . Then I went upstairs , and then I punched in and went to work . . . . No , I was not paid for the training downstairs . Yes , I 'm sure . " I asked June if she had had any difficulty with the fries . " No , it was just like the film . You put the french fries in the grease and you push a button which does n't go off till the fries are done . Then you take them out and put them in a bin under a light . Then you scoop them into the bags with this thing , this flat , light metal ? I ca n't really describe it ? scoop thing that sits right in the package and makes the fries fall in place . " " Did they watch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Did you need more instruction ? " " Someone leaned over once and showed me how to make  | sure tile fry scooper was set inside the opening of the bag so the fries would fall in right . " " And then ? " " And then , I stood on my feet from twenty after four till the manager took over my station at 10:35 P.M. " When I left my legs were aching . I knew it was n't a job for me . But I probably would have tried to last it out ? at least more than a day ? if it was n't for the hours . When I got home I talked it over with my mother and my sister and then I phoned and said I could n't work there . They were n't angry . They just said to bring back the uniform . . . . The people were nice , even the managers . It 's just a rushed system . " " June , " I said , " does it make any sense to train you and have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell you the real hours in the first place ? " " They take a chance and see if you 're desperate . I have my family to stay with . That 's why I did n't go back . But if I really needed the money , like if I had a kid and no family , I 'd have to make arrangements to work any hours . " Anyway , they got a full day 's work out of me . " I waited on line at my neighborhood McDonald 's . It was lunch hour and there were four or five customers at each of the five open cash registers . " May I take your order ? " a very thin girl said in a fiat tone to the man at the head of my line . " McNuggets , large fries and a Coke , " said the man . The cashier punched in the order . " That will be ? " . " Big Mac , large fries and a shake , " said the next woman on line . The cashier rang it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coffee , " said the third customer . The cashier rang it up .  | " How much is a large fries ? " asked the woman directly in front of me . The thin cashier twisted her neck around trying to look up at the menu board . " Sorry , " apologized the customer , " I do n't have my glasses . " " Large fries is seventy-nine , " a round-faced cashier with glasses interjected from the next register . " Seventy-nine cents , " the thin cashier repeated . " Well how much is a small fries ? " As they talked I leaned over the next register . " Say , can I interview you ? " I asked the clerk with glasses , whose line was by then empty . " Huh ? " " I 'm writing a story about jobs at fast-food restaurants . " " O.K. I guess so . " " Can I have your phone number ? " " Well ... I 'll meet you when I get off . Should be sometime between 4 and 4:30 . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large fries , " I said . The thin cashier pressed " lge fries . " In place of numbers , the keys on a McDonald 's cash register say " lge fries , " " reg fries , " " med coke , " big mac , " and so on . Some registers have pictures on the key caps . The next time the price of fries goes up ( or down ) the change will be entered in the store 's central computer . But the thin cashier will continue to press the same button . I wondered how long she 'd worked there and how many hundreds of " lge fries " she 'd served without learning the price . Damita , the cashier with the glasses , came up from the crew room ( a room in the basement with lockers , a table and a  | video player for studying the training disks ) at 4:45 . She looked older and more serious without her striped uniform . " Sorry , but they got busy and , you know , here you get off when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first complaint . " You give them your availability when you sign on . Mine I said 9 to 4 . But they scheduled me for 7 o'clock two or three days a week . And I needed the money . So I got to get up 5 in the morning to get here from Queens by 7 . And I do n't get off till whoever 's supposed to get here gets here to take my place . . . . It 's hard to study with all the pressures . " Damita had come to the city from a small town outside of Detroit . She lives with her sister in Queens and takes extension courses in psychology at New York University . Depending on the schedule posted each Friday , her McDonald 's paycheck for a five-day week has varied from $80 to $114 . " How long have you worked at McDonald 's ? " I asked . " Well , see I only know six people in this city , so my manager from Michigan . . . yeah , I worked for McDonald 's in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this guy Brian who 's the second assistant manager here . So I did n't have to fill out an application . Well , I mean the first thing I needed was a job , " she seemed to apologize , " and I knew I could always work at McDonald 's . I always say I 'm gon na look for something else , but I do n't get out till 4 and that could be 5 or whenever . " The flexible scheduling at McDonald 's only seems to work one way . One day Damita had arrived a half hour late because the E train was running on the R track . " The assistant manager told me not to clock in at all , just to go home . So I said O.K. and I left . " " What did you do the rest of the day ? " I asked . " I went home and studied , and I went to sleep . "  | " But how did it make you feel ? " " It 's like a humiliating feeling ' cause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But when I spoke to the Puerto Rican manager he said it was nothing personal against me . Just it was raining that day , and they were really slow and someone who got here on time , it would n't be right to send them home . " " Were n't you annoyed to spend four hours traveling and then lose a day 's pay ? " I suggested . " I was mad at first that they did n't let me explain . But afterwards I understood and I tried to explain to my sister : Time waits for no man . ' " " Since you signed on for 9 to 4 , " I asked Damita , " and you 're going to school , why ca n't you say , Look , I have to study at night , I need regular hours ' ? " " Do n't work that way . They make up your schedule every week and if you ca n't work it , you 're responsible to replace yourself . If you ca n't they can always get someone else . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her low estimate of her own worth , " anyone can see right away that your line moves fast yet you 're helpful to people . I mean , you 're a valuable employee . And this manager seems to like you . " " Valuable ! $3.35 an hour . And I can be replaced by any pointing across the room kid off the street . " I had n't noticed . At a small table under the staircase a manager in a light beige shirt was taking an application from a lanky black teenager . " But you know the register . You know the routine . " " How long you think it takes to learn the six steps ? Step 1 . Greet the customer , Good morning , can I help you ? ' Step 2 . Take his order . Step 3 . Repeat the order . They can have someone off the street working my register in five minutes . " " By the way , " I asked , " on those cash registers without numbers , how do you change something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orders a cheeseburger and then they  | change it to a hamburger , how do you subtract the slice of cheese ? " " I guess that 's why you have step 3 , repeat the order . One cheeseburger , two Cokes , three ... " " Yeah but if you punched a mistake or they do n't want it after you get it together ? " " Like if I have a crazy customer , which I do be gettin ' ' specially in this city , and they order hamburger , fries and shake , and it 's $2.95 and then they just walk away ? " " I once did that here , " I said . " About a week ago when I first started my research . All I ordered was some french fries . And I was so busy watching how the computer works that only after she rang it up I discovered that I 'd walked out of my house without my wallet . I did n't have a penny . I was so embarrassed . " " Are you that one the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she said , Look at that crazy lady going out . She 's lookin ' and lookin ' at everything and then she did n't have no money for a bag of fries . ' I saw you leaving , but I guess I did n't recognize you . I agreed it was probably me . O.K. , so say this crazy lady comes in and orders french fries and leaves . In Michigan I could just zero it out . I 'd wait till I start the next order and press zero and large fries . But here you 're supposed to call out cancel sale ' and the manager comes over and does it with his key . " But I hate to call the manager every time , ' specially if I got a whole line waiting . So I still zero out myself . They can tell I do it by the computer tape , and they tell me not to . Some of them let me , though , because they know I came from another store . But they do n't show the girls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the manager 's key to do it . " " Maybe they let you because they can tell you 're honest , " I said . She smiled , pleased , but let it pass . " That 's what I mean that you 're valuable to them . You know how to use the register . You 're good with customers . "  | " You know there was a man here , " Damita said , a little embarrassed about bragging , " when I was transferred off night he asked my manager , What happened to that girl from Michigan ? ' " " Did your manager tell you that ? " " No , another girl on the night shift told me . The manager said it to her . They do n't tell you nothing nice themselves . " " But , see , you are good with people and he appreciates it . " " In my other McDonald 's ? not the one where they let me zero out but another one I worked in in Michigan ? I was almost fired for my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open the little packets . And another bad attitude of mine is that you 're supposed to suggest to the customer , Would you like a drink with that ? ' or Do you want a pie ? '  --  whatever they 're pushing . I do n't like to do it . And they can look on my tape after my shift and see I did n't push the suggested sell item . " McDonald 's computerized cash registers allow managers to determine immediately not only the dollar volume for the store but the amount of each item that was sold at each register for any given period . Two experienced managers , interviewed separately , both insisted that the new electronic cash registers were in fact slower than the old mechanical registers . Clerks who knew the combinations ? hamburger , fries , Coke : $2.45 ? could ring up the total immediately , take the cash and give change in one operation . On the new registers you have to enter each item and may be slowed down by computer response time . The value of the new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ McDonald 's franchisers can choose from several approved registers ) , is the increasingly sophisticated tracking systems , which monitor all the activity and report with many different statistical breakdowns . " Look , there . " said Damita as the teenage job applicant left and the manager went behind the counter with the application , " If I was to say I ca n't come in at 7 , they 'd cut my hours  | down to one shift a week , and if I never came back they would n't call to find out where I was . " I worked at a hospital once as an X-ray assistant . There if I did n't come in there were things that had to be done that would n't be done . I would call there and say , Remember to run the EKGs . ' Here , if I called and said , I just ca n't come by 7 no more , ' they 'd have one of these high school kids off the street half an hour later . And they 'd do my job just as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then she made a difficult plea . " This might sound stupid , I do n't know , " she said , " but I feel like , I came here to study and advance myself but I 'm not excelling myself in any way . I 'm twenty years old but ? this sounds terrible to say ? I 'm twenty but I 'd rather have a babysitting job . At least I could help a kid and take care . But I only know six people in this city . So I do n't even know how I 'd find a babysitting job . " " I 'll keep my ears open , " I said . " I do n't know where I 'd hear of one but ... " Damita seemed a little relieved . I suppose she realized there was n't much chance of babysitting full-time , but at least she now knew seven people in the city . Jon DeAngelo , twenty-two , has been a McDonald 's manager for three years . He started in the restaurant business at sixteen as a busboy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someday . At nineteen , when he was the night manager of a resort kitchen , he was hired away by McOpCo , the McDonald 's Operating Company . Though McDonald 's is primarily a franchise system , the company also owns and operates about 30 percent of the stores directly . These McOpCo stores , including some of the busiest units , are managed via a chain of command includ- ing regional supervisors , store managers and first and second assistants who can be moved from unit to unit . In addition , there 's a network of inspectors from Hamburger Central who make announced and unannounced checks for QSC ( quality , service , cleanliness ) at both franchise and McOpCo installations . Jon was hired at $14,000 a year . At the time I spoke with him his annual pay was $21,000-a very good salary at McDonald 's . At first he 'd been an assistant manager in one of the highest-volume stores in his region . Then he was deliberately transferred to a store with productivity problems . " I got there and found it was really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they loved to work . I started them having fun by putting the men on the women 's jobs and vice versa . At most McDonald 's the women tend to work on the registers , the men on the grill . But everyone starts at the same pay . Oh , sure , they hated it at first , the guys that is . But they liked learning all the stations . I also ran a lot of register races . " Since the computer tape in each register indicates sales per hour , per half hour or for any interval requested , the manager can revv the crew up for a real " on your mark , get set , go ! " race with a printout ready as they cross the finish line , showing the dollars taken in at each register during the race . The computer will also print out a breakdown of sales for any particular menu item . The central office can check , therefore , how many Egg McMuffins were sold on Friday from 9 to 9:30 two weeks or two years ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ register . This makes it possible to run a register race limited to Cokes for instance , or Big Macs . Cashiers are instructed to try suggestive selling ( " Would you like a drink with that ? " ) at all times . But there are periods when a particular item is being pushed . The manager may then offer a prize for the most danish sold . A typical prize for either type of cash register race might be  | a Snoopy mug ( if that 's the current promotion ) or even a $5 cash bonus . " This crew loved to race as individuals , " says Jon of his troubled store , " but even more as a team . They 'd love to get on a production mode , like a chicken-pull-drop or a burgerturn-lay and kill themselves for a big rush . " One Saturday after a rock concert we did a $1,900 hour with ten people on crew . We killed ourselves but when the rush was over everyone said it was the most fun they ever had in a McDonald 's . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schedule . How would he decide who and how many to assign ? " It comes out of the computer , " Jon explained . " It 's a bar graph with the business you 're going to do that week already printed in . " " The business you'regoing to do , already printed in ? " " It 's based on the last week 's sales , like maybe you did a $300 hour on Thursday at 3 P.M. Then it automatically adds a certain percent , say 15 percent , which is the projected annual increase for your particular store . . . . No , the person scheduling does n't have to do any of this calculation . I just happen to know how it 's arrived at . Really , it 's simple , it 's just a graph with the numbers already in it . $400 hour , $500 hour . According to Hamburger Central you schedule two crew members per $100 hour . So if you 're projected for a $600 hour on Friday between 1 and 2 , you know you need twelve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ space for their names . " " You mean you just fill in the blanks on the chart ? " " It 's pretty automatic except in the case of a special event like the concert . Then you have to guess the dollar volume . Scheduling under could be a problem , but over would be a disaster to your crew labor productivity . " " Crew labor productivity ? " " Everything at McDonald 's is based on the numbers . But  | crew labor productivity is pretty much the number a manager is judged by . " " Crew labor productivity ? You have to be an economist . " " It 's really simple to calculate . You take the total crew labor dollars paid out , divide that into the total food dollars taken in . That gives you your crew labor productivity . The more food you sell and the less people you use to do it , the better your percentage . It 's pretty simple . " Apparently , I still looked confused . " For example , if you take an $800 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very high crew labor percent . " " That 's good ? " " Yes that 's good . Then the manager in the next store hears Jon ran a 12 percent labor this week , I 'll run a 10 percent labor . Of course you burn people out that way . But ... " " But Jon , " I asked , " if the number of crew you need is set in advance and printed by the computer , why do so many managers keep changing hours and putting pressure on kids to work more ? " " They advertise McDonald 's as a flexible work schedule for high school and college kids , " he said , " but the truth is it 's a high-pressure job , and we have so much trouble keeping help , especially in fast stores like my first one ( it grossed $1.8 million last year ) , that 50 percent never make it past two weeks . And a lot walk out within two days . " When I was a first assistant , scheduling and hiring was my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or another . There were so many times I covered the shifts myself . Times I worked 100 hours a week . A manager has to fill the spaces on his chart somehow . So if a crew person is manipulable they manipulate him . " " What do you mean ? " " When you first sign on , you give your availability . Let 's say a person 's schedule is weeknights , 4 to 10 . But after a week the manager schedules him as a closer Friday night .  | He calls in upset , Hey , my availability is n't Friday night . ' The manager says Well the schedule is already done . And you know the rule . If you ca n't work it 's up to you to replace yourself . ' At that point the person might quit , or he might not show up or he might have a fight with the manager . " " So he 's fired ? " " No . You do n't fire . You would only fire for cause like drugs or stealing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a week and suddenly he 's only scheduled for four . So either he starts being more available or he quits . " " Are n't you worried that the most qualified people will quit ? " " The only qualification to be able to do the job is to be able physically to do the job . I believe it says that in almost those words in my regional manual . And being there is the main part of being physically able to do the job . " " But what about your great crew at the second store ? Do n't you want to keep a team together ? " " Let me qualify that qualification . It takes a special kind of person to be able to move before he can think . We find people like that and use them till they quit . " " But as a manager do n't you look bad if too many people are quitting ? " " As a manager I am judged by the statistical reports which come off the computer . Which basically means my crew labor productivity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could have a good fry yield , a low M &R; Maintenance and Repair budget . But these are minor . " As it happens , Jon is distinguished among McDonald 's managers in his area as an expert on the computerized equipment . Other managers call on him for cash register repairs . " They say , Jon , could you look at my register ? I just ca n't afford the M &R; this month . ' So I come and fix it and they 'll buy me a beer . "  | " So keeping M &R; low is a real feather in a manager 's cap , " I deduced . " O.K. , it 's true , you can over spend your M &R; budget ; you can have a low fry yield ; you can run a dirty store ; you can be fired for bothering the high school girls . But basically , every Coke spigot is monitored . At most McDonald 's , Coke does n't flow from taps that turn on and off . Instead the clerk pushes the button " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " which then dispenses the premeasured amount into the appropriate-size cup . This makes the syrup yield fairly consistent . Every ketchup squirt is measured . My costs for every item are set . So my crew labor productivity is my main flexibility . " I was beginning to understand the pressures toward pettiness . I had by then heard many complaints about slight pilferage of time . For instance , as a safety measure no one was allowed to stay in a store alone . There was a common complaint that a closer would be clocked out when he finished cleaning the store for the night , even though he might be required to wait around unpaid till the manager finished his own nightly statistical reports . At other times kids clocked out and then waited hours ( unpaid ) for a crew chief training course ( unpaid ) . Overtime is an absolute taboo at McDonald 's . Managers practice every kind of scheduling gymnastic to see that no one works over forty hours a week . If a crew member approaching forty hours is needed to close the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out for a long lunch . I had heard of a couple of occasions when , in desperation , a manager scheduled someone to stay an hour or two over forty hours . Instead of paying time-and-a-half , he compensated at straight time listing the extra hours as miscellaneous and paying through a fund reserved for things like register race bonuses . All of this of course to make his statistics look good . " There must be some other way to raise your productivity , " I suggested , " besides squeezing it out of the kids . "  | " I try to make it fun , " Jon pleaded earnestly . " I know that people like to work on my shifts . I have the highest crew labor productivity in the area . But I get that from burning people out . Look , you ca n't squeeze a McDonald 's hamburger any flatter . If you want to improve your productivity there is nothing for a manager to squeeze but the crew . " " But if it 's crew dollars paid out divided by food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollars instead of using less crew . " " O.K. , let me tell you about sausage sandwiches . " " Sausage sandwiches ? " ( Sounded awful . ) " My crew was crazy about sausage sandwiches . Crew members are entitled to one meal a day at reduced prices . The meals are deducted from wages through a computerized link to the time clocks . They made it from a buttered English muffin , a slice of sausage and a slice of cheese . I understand this had actually been a menu item in some parts of the country but never here . But the crew would make it for themselves and then all their friends came in and wanted them . " So , I decided to go ahead and sell it . It costs about 9 ? to make and I sold it for $1.40 . It went like hotcakes . My supervisor even liked the idea because it made so much money . You could see the little dollar signs in his eyes when he first came into the store . And he said nothing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Oak Brook and they made us stop it . " Just look how ridiculous that is . A slice of sausage is 60k as a regular menu item , and an English muffin is 45 . So if you come in and ask for a sausage and an English muffin I can still sell them to you today for $1.05 . But there 's no way I can add the slice of cheese and put it in the box and get that $1.40 . " Basically , I ca n't be any more creative than a crew person . I ca n't take any more initiative then the person on the register . " " Speaking of cash registers and initiative , " I said . . . and  | told him about Damita . I explained that she was honest , bright and had learned how to zero out at another store . " Do you let cashiers zero out ? " I asked . " I might let her in this case , " Jon said . " The store she learned it at was probably a franchise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need people like her . Thinking generally slows this operation down . " When I first came to McDonald 's , I said , How mechanical ! These kids do n't even know how to cook . ' But the pace is so fast that if they did n't have all the systems , you could n't handle it . It takes ninety seconds to cook a hamburger . In those seconds you have to toast the buns , dress it , sear it , turn it , take it off the grill and serve it . Meanwhile you 've got maybe twenty-four burgers , plus your chicken , your fish . You have n't got time to pick up a rack of fillet and see if it 's done . You have to press the timer , drop the fish and know , without looking , that when it buzzes it 's done . " It 's the same thing with management . You have to record the money each night before you close and get it to the bank the next day by 11 A.M. So you have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . These computers also calculate the payrolls , because they 're hooked into the time clocks . My payroll is paid out of a bank in Chicago . The computers also tell you how many people you 're going to need each hour . It 's so fast that the manager has n't got time to think about it . He has to follow the procedures like the crew . And if he follows the procedures everything is going to come out more or less as it 's supposed to . So basically the computer manages the store . " Listening to Jon made me remember what Ray Kroc had written about his own job ( head of the corporation ) and com-puters : We have a computer in Oak Brook that is designed to make real estate surveys . But those printouts are of no use to me.  | After we find a promising location , I drive around it in a car , go into the corner saloon and the neighborhood supermarket . I mingle with the people and observe their comings and goings . That tells me what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would do there . " 2 By combining twentieth-century computer technology with ninetenth-century time-and-motion studies , the McDonald 's corporation has broken the jobs of griddleman , waitress , cashier and even manager down into small , simple steps . Historically these have been service jobs involving a lot of flexibility and personal flare . But the corporation has systematically extracted the decision-making elements from filling french fry boxes or scheduling staff . They 've siphoned the know-how from the employees into the programs . They relentlessly weed out all variables that might make it necessary to make a decision at the store level , whether on pickles or on cleaning procedures . It 's interesting and understandable that Ray Kroc refused to work that way . The real estate computer may be as reliable as the fry vat probe . But as head of the company Kroc did n't have to surrender to it . He 'd let the computer juggle all the demographic variables , but in the end Ray Kroc would decide , intuitively , where to put the next store . Jon DeAngelo , would like to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ June and Damita . If they had a chance to use some skill or intuition at their own levels , they 'd not only feel more alive , they 'd also be treated with more consideration . It 's job organization , not malice , that allows ( almost requires ) McDonald 's workers to be handled like paper plates . They feel disposable because they are . I was beginning to wonder why Jon stayed on at McDonald 's . He still yearned to open a restaurant . " The one thing I 'd take from McDonald 's to a French restaurant of my own is the fry vat computer . It really works . " He seemed to  | have both the diligence and the style to run a personalized restaurant . Of course he may not have had the capital . " So basically I would tell that girl bringing me back to Damita to find a different job . She 's thinking too much and it slows things down . The way the system is set up , I do n't need that in a register person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Jon , " I said , trying to be tactful , " I do n't exactly know why you stay at McDonald 's . " " As a matter of fact , I have already turned in my resignation . " " You mean you 're not a McDonald 's manager any more ? " I was dismayed . " I quit once before and they asked me to stay . " " I have had such a hard time getting a full-fledged manager to talk to me and now I do n't know whether you count . " " They have n't actually accepted my resignation yet . You know I heard of this guy in another region who said he was going to leave and they did n't believe him . They just would n't accept his resignation . And you know what he did ? One day , at noon , he just emptied the store , walked out , and locked the door behind him . " For a second Jon seemed to drift away on that beautiful image . It was like the kids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out the back door . " You know what that means to close a McDonald 's at noon , to do a zero hour at lunch ? " " Jon , " I said . " This has been fantastic . You are fantastic . I do n't think anyone could explain the computers to me the way you do . But I want to talk to someone who 's happy and moving up in the McDonald 's system . Do you think you could introduce me to a manager who ... " " You wo n't be able to . " " How come ? " " First of all , there 's the media hotline . If any press comes around or anyone is writing a book I 'm supposed to call the  | regional office immediately and they will provide someone to talk to you . So you ca n't speak to a real corporation person except by arrangement with the corporation . " Second , you ca n't talk to a happy McDonald 's manager because 98 percent are miserable . " Third of all , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The computer manages the store . "  | Neither the managers nor the griddlemen at McDonald 's have to know much about restaurants , bookkeeping or food . The clerks do n't have to know the prices or even how to add . For McDonald 's and other fast-food chains , it 's the perfect way to use their undereducated , undermotivated high-turnover help . Because no one 's going to stay around very long , the company designs a system with little to learn . Since there 's little to learn they invest only a few minutes breaking in new help . So there 's no need to make the job pleasant or pay much above minimum wage . Of course , that leads to even higher turnover , but the employer is prepared for high turnover because the job is designed to use undereducated , undermotivated , high-turnover . . . etc . It 's a vicious circle , eventually producing a labor force fit for McDonald 's . Of course there are still a few people doing extraordinary planning at the center to design a system that requires @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amazing that Mc- Donald 's was able to devise a kitchen that operates almost as automatically as a factory . Traditionally the short-order cook was a skilled , sassy , idiosyncratic character ? almost the exact opposite of the fast-food stereotype . It was difficult to break his job down into precise , repetitious motions , first because there were so many items on the menu , which could be ordered with so many variations . Second , it was hard to make griddle work as routine as assembly line work because food is more idiosyncratic than bolts . The old-fashioned griddlernan had to watch , smell and listen , to know when the burger was sizzling , the steak medium-rare , the hash browns crisp . McDonald 's deliberately set out to eliminate these elements of skill and discretion by making the burger as standard as a bolt . They succeeded . Their uniform patty and pickle chip make it possible to assemble a sandwich in almost the same way you assemble a clock or a toaster . McDonald 's standardized the job by standardizing the raw material . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If a french fry is more complicated than a fender , just think how unpredictable a conversation is compared to a fried egg or even a souffle . Until recently , airline reservation agents have been highpaid , long-term employees . They were valued because they had to learn all the company 's routes , fares and policies . Then they had to apply this knowledge while responding on the telephone to the thousands of turns that even the simplest conversation can take . It seemed that this would always involve a great deal of personal judgment . After all , a two-way conversation is n't made out of interchangeable parts . But in a feat of standardization even more phenomenal than McDonald 's fry vat computer , the airlines have found ways to break down human conversation into predictable modules that can be handled almost as routinely as a bolt or a burger . This has already downgraded reservation work . And as I  | listened to airline reservation agents I slowly realized that something more than their job was being simplified . I met young people like Kenny at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the two-minute reservation conversation was now timed and graded . Kenny , a new and enthusiastic employee , told me that he liked the work , despite its stresses , because he liked being " involved with people . " This modern young man seemed to have no idea that involvement had once meant something far more spontaneous than what he now did . I also met many reservation agents ( most of them older ) who understood how their own responses were being streamlined , and they resisted . They would have followed company instructions for assembling a car , I believe , but assembling a conversation was somehow different . Only a few people fear that they will lose their individuality by wearing mass-produced clothing or eating mass-produced food . ( Big Macs and Levis may be America 's greatest inventions . ) But manufactured words are something else . ( Somehow , it seems that when they standardize my conversation they standardize the real me . ) Yet the automation of conversation is just an extension of factory or fast-food automation : first the bolt , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 'll see far more complex conversations about psychology , finance and welfare similarly reduced to standard interchangeable inputs , with the result that psychologists , financial planners and social workers are reduced from professionals to clerks . I would n't have believed it possible if I had n't seen , in detail , how conversation was automated at the airlines .  | " 6:30 ? , " I said . " Perfect . I 'll meet you in the lobby . I 'm real short ? four-eleven ? and I 'll wear a pink sweater . " It had taken four weeks to find an airline reservation agent who would talk to me . I think the problem was some union organizing in the industry , which was making people cautious . But then a theatre acquaintance gave me Kenny 's number , and he agreed immediately . He even suggested we meet in the company lobby . I should n't have stopped back for my messages before 6:30 . " Sorry , " said Kenny 's voice on the answering machine , " last minute change . Maybe I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hartford . " " So , they 're on to me here already ! " The reservation agents at American Airlines are supposed to check the electronic bulletin board in the computer each day for important messages . " TO ALL PERSONNEL : I imagined it flickering on a graygreen screen ON NO ACCOUNT SPEAK TO A SMALL WOMAN IN A PINK SWEATER . " I wondered if the ban was industrywide . I decided to show up in the lobby at 6:30 anyway . Perhaps when he sees me . . Six-one with curly hair was n't much to go on . If he had really been avoiding me , he could have walked right past , but he stopped . " Oh , you must be ... I left you a message . " His grandmother was sick . That 's why he would n't be able to make it for dinner . But , sure , we could reschedule . Why not ? " Thursday is my day off this week . " He even offered me a lift to make up for the inconvenience . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American for " Let 's see , it 's a year now . I 'm just passing my probation . "  | " I thought the probation period was six months . " " Yes , but I was laid off shortly after I was hired . They had overestimated their manning need . " But Kenny was resilient . " You get used to collecting unemployment when you work in the theater . " And he loved the job . " Reservations is a lot like acting . Eight hours a day you 're on with the public . You have to be lively , you have to try to sell , you have to be turned on all day . That 's what I really love about it . " The only thing I do n't like is the low pay . I make less here than in the theater . " " Less than in the theater ? ! " " It 's pretty low . " " I heard about that offer of a full year 's severance pay , " I said . ( Both United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyone with seniority who would quit . Until recently , long-term , loyal employees had been considered desirable . Some of the senior agents made as much as $15 an hour . ) " I guess they did it to take new people on at much lower salaries , " I sympathized . " Those older people , " Kenny inveighed , " some of them were sitting there just racking up those high hourly salaries , while there 's plenty of us out there who truly want to work for an airline . " " What exactly are you making ? " " $5.77 an hour . It 's just an entry-level position . If I came in now I 'd have to start in telemarketing at $4 an hour . American had begun to do telephone soliciting for other companies . This $4-an-hour phone job was now the apprenticeship into reservations . I do n't intend to stay in reservations my whole life . I 'd like to work at the airport , maybe be a flight attendant . This company has a lot of mobility . I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " And there 's the flight benefits , " I reminded him .  | " Yes . " Kenny concurred . " That 's definitely one of the main attractions . " We agreed to meet for brunch on Thursday . " There 's AHU , that 's After Hang Up time . It 's supposed to be fourteen seconds . It just came down to thirteen . But my average is five seconds AHU , because I do most of the work while the customer 's still on the phone . There 's your talk time , your availability , your occupancy ? that 's the percent of time you 're plugged in , which is supposed to be 98 percent . That 's not the same as your availability . There 's bookings . You 're supposed to book 26 percent of your calls , which is very low . I 've averaged 37 percent in the five months I 've been here . " Kenny was explaining the computer-collected statistics on which his first raise would be based . Raises currently ranged from 2 to 7 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the numerical standards , for AHU , talk time , occupancy and so on , you met or exceeded . " One of the big numbers up to now is conversion rate . " I 'd never heard of a conversion rate . " Every call is either action or potential , " Kenny explained . " If someone calls up and says , Hi , I want to go to L.A. first class , ' that 's action . There 's nothing I have to do but get the information . " But the fare shopping ! He held his hands up in horror . " Where they want to know is it cheaper if I go in the middle of the week or at night or after the holiday . " " You mean like I want to visit my mother in Florida , so I listen to all the rates and then say , Thanks , I 'll call back after I talk to my mother ' ? " " Right . Now if someone were listening in , I would be graded on how I probed for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , becoming the customer . " Thank you . I 'll  | have to call my mother and see what time is most convenient for her . " Kenny played the reservation agent : " And do you think you 'll be flying toward the beginning or the middle of the week ? " " Well , uh , I have to be back by the following weekend so I guess the beginning . " " Tuesday we have a flight leaving at 10 and at 4 . Which would you prefer ? ( See , I 'm trying to get you to make a tentative booking . ) Ten ? " " But I do n't really know yet . I 'll call back after I ... " " So I give you a sales pitch . It costs nothing to save a seat . There 's limited seating at the SuperSaver fare . ' I could give them every sales pitch in the world and they still say now he imitates me , repeating like a parrot , I have to call my mother , I have to call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' " If we 're going round and round and you keep resisting , I move into what we call a close . I still have room on the flight leaving at 10 on Tuesday . Let 's hold the seat for you tentatively . What 's your last name ? ' And if you say , My last name is Garson , ' then I know I 've booked it . I 've converted a poten-tial ! " " Congratulations . " I shook his hand across the table . " But if you still say , ' Dail dah dah dah , ' then I could go back to a sales pitch . We 're coming on the holidays ; summer is a hard time to fly ; it does n't cost you anything to hold the booking . Now of the 10 o'clock and the 4 o'clock , which do you prefer ? ' " " You 're closing again , " I said . " No , " he explained , Which do you prefer ' is called a probe . What 's your last name ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close and they do n't book I could start around again . I could go around and around for two hours . It 's always a pull between keeping your talk time down and getting your conversion rate  | up . There 's no actual rule on it . Generally , I say if you come to close twice and they do n't book , let them go . " I stared at Kenny . " That 's amazing . " I knew , of course , that good salesmen had always analyzed every phase of a contact . But it had never occurred to me that my two-minute reservation conversation could be broken down into opening , sales pitch , probe and close . When Kenny is monitored live , by his supervisor , he 'll also be graded for such subjective qualities as tone of voice and effective use of name , as in , " If you like , Mrs. Garson , I can book you on the ... " " And you never ask a yes or no question , " he cautioned me . " Never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's , Which would you prefer , the 10 o'clock or the 4 o'clock ? ' " " Kenny , I have to apologize . I always thought I was being a good citizen not to hold seats on SuperSavers . But I realize now I was being a resister . I did n't mean to give you so much trouble . I 'll book anything from now on . " " But the system is changing , " Kenny informed me , " starting the first of the year . They found out that American was being too pushy on the phone and that the general flying public did n't like our reservation agents . We were down to number 2 instead of number 1 . So we 're gong to move into a general rating of call effectiveness . When they listen in they 'll grade you on how well you used the sales tools : customer 's name , tone of voice , all that 's the same . But the number that will be important now is the number of passengers boarded under your sign . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like astrology . Kenny explained . " We each have a number ? our sign ? which we use when we make a booking in the computer . Your monthlies monthly computer-generated statistics contain the number of passengers per hour you worked who actually boarded a plane ? that 's boarded under your sign . ' " So now I should n't book unless I mean to fly , is that it ? "  | " They 'll still have the number of bookings on your dailies the individual statistics that Kenny 's supervisor posted near the lockers each day , so you still try to book . But the number boarded under your sign will get the emphasis starting at the beginning of the year . " The new emphasis seemed to suggest a more free-form conversation . But I was mistaken to believe that American Airlines was going to leave things up to the individual agent . Even as I talked with Kenny , supervisors and agents in the four regional offices ( Dallas , Los Angeles , Cincinnati and Hartford ) were getting time off the phones for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said to change in China . One year the Americans were the imperialist hyenas and the Russians the friends of the proletariat . The next year it reversed ; and when it reversed it reversed for 800 million people at once . A study had shown that the emphasis on conversion made American 's agents seem too pushy . Now we would enter together into the era of nonpushing , all in the same way on the same day . " How do you keep yourself tuned in ? " I asked Kenny . " How do you keep yourself performing seven-and-a-half hours a day ? " " They provide me with the scenario , the basic script and the props , and I have to keep that alive . " " Are you ever tempted to put someone on hold just to have a minute or two of breathing time ? " " If you put people on hold you 're running up your talk time , so it 's not a good way to bring your stats up . And at some point you 'll be monitored doing it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the line . That 's where the acting comes in . If you can improvise till you get the answer out of the computer , stay one thought ahead , keep up the patter ... If anyone was monitoring they 'd know I used all the techniques . "  | " How does the monitoring work ? " I asked . " I mean the human monitoring , what does it feel like ? " " We do n't know when we 're being listened to . You know afterwards because normally you get calls one after another without any let up . Suddenly there 's a break , you look around and you see there 's calls coming in to the other agents but you 're not getting any . Then you hear a voice in your ear , Hello . ' It 's the supervisor from a listening post . Mine is usually on another floor . There are listening posts all over the office . " You never know when it will happen . I have n't been monitored yet this month so I figure some time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " What do they say ? " " Let me try to remember how it was last month . She said , Hello , I 've been listening to your calls for an hour and you 've been doing everything fine . Keep it up . " " What would a criticism be like ? " " Usually it 's , You did n't ask for the business . " You should have closed . ' " Sometimes they also listen from the corporate headquarters in Dallas . It 's called trunk monitoring . But they never come in on the line . You never know about Dallas . " I told Kenny a story I 'd heard from a reservation agent in Canada . A woman sat down at the beginning of her shift , plugged in and said to her friend , " The doctor says it 's cancer . " Then she took her first call . Within an hour she was called into the supervisor 's office , who asked sympathetically , " Is there any way we can help about your cancer ? " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " How could you have told them ! ? " The women thought they had to be talking to a customer to be overheard . They did n't know until then that the system picked up their voices as soon as they plugged in . " Well , here we know it picks up everything , " Kenny assured  | me . " If you 're talking to someone in the office , you cover the microphone tube over . " He made a subtle gesture with just one finger , like someone covering the opening of a straw . " But the best thing is to save your sociability for the customers . " " But you really like the job ? " " Except for the pay . " But Kenny fully agreed with the company 's wage policy . " They have to be competitive . They have to be able to operate with minimal costs . $5.77 an hour is n't so bad . I do n't really have to own a car . " I asked Kenny how he managed on his pay . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a nurse . In this day and age you have to live communally . It keeps costs down and makes you able to afford a little more extras . " Before we parted I asked Kenny if he knew of anyone else at the office who might talk to me . " Is there someone on your shift ? " I suggested . " Well , see , you start at 7:00 to 3:30 , 7:30 to 4:00 , 8:00 to 4:30 , depending on the manning need . Then there 's a whole bunch of people called floaters , ' which is what I am . Every week you bid for your schedules . I 'd have to be there five or six years , I think , before I 'd wind up with a Monday to Friday with weekends off . " Then there 's T.L. Time-card Leave . You sign a sheet on the table when you come in if you 're willing to go home early , and they come around and tell you you can leave if the call volume declines . There 's also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people who are n't making a lot of money , like me ? and Christmas is coming ? so I 've been working two or three hours over this week . Which is hard . As much as I like the job it 's hard to sit there ten hours a day tied to this computer that keeps track of your every move . Your phone line is like your umbilical chord into the computer . " They also offer you overage leaves ? which are without  | pay but you keep your seniority and benefits ? which I would like to take sometimes to do something in the theater again . But they ca n't tell you how long a leave it will be till right before , because it depends on the call volume projections . " You can also take T.L. lunches , which is they 'll give you a long lunch if they see a decline in the call volume at your lunch hour . And you can get T.L. before you come in by phoning and then you can start late . " For all these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a crew he worked with . " On this job it 's not very social . You come in and you plug in and you save your sociability for the customers . But really , that 's what I like about it ? dealing with the public . No two phone calls are ever the same . You have to start where the ball drops . I like being involved with people . " Canadian airlines use the same computerized reservation systems as U.S. airlines , and they collect the same statistics on their agents . But they had n't gone as far in standardizing the reservation conversation . Nor had the shifts become as flexible or the agents as plug-in-able as Kenny . To me , the tone and pace at Air Canada in Toronto seemed slow , polite , almost old fashioned . In the Air Canada cafeteria in Toronto , the union delegation overwhelmed me with printouts . " This one 's called PASER ? How do you like that acronym they picked ? ? It gives them your number of calls , your percent of bookings , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " STAR is more intimate , " someone handed me a second sheet of indecipherable figures . " It tallies your number of calls , the average length of calls , the average number of seconds  | between calls , and your percent of time in line . " STAR and PASER correspond roughly to the dailies and monthlies at American Airlines . " Then there 's the QAP Quality Assurance Program . That 's just Bertha in the back taking things down ... " " And your supervisor can tape you from any station ... " " And they can always listen from the manager 's office , and ... " " It 's like being hooked up to a biofeedback machine ! " the union 's stress specialist said . " Only it makes you sick instead of well . " On the way from the cafeteria to the union office , I peeked into the reservation room itself . I was surprised by the carpeted calm . There were a large number of mature men and women , well dressed , I thought , for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " What 's that ? " I pointed to a bottle of pills on the control desk in the center of the room . " What 's EXDOL ? " " Shhh , " said the union chairperson , elbowing me toward the exit as I tried to copy the label on an unfamiliar brand of pain reliever . " Shh , " she said , " I do n't know if you 're allowed in here and I did n't ask . Let 's get back to the union office . " In the Air Canada stairwell we ran into a middle-aged man with curly hair and a square , smiling face . He nodded and tipped his coffee container at us . " She 's doing a story on the electronic monitoring . " Meg , the chairperson , introduced me to Jack Burford . " If you 'd like to interview him ... " " I see the good and bad in it , " said Jack , " so I could n't really give you the union point of view . " " Terrific ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It makes it a more interesting story to have a lot of points of view . " It was 10 A.M. , Jack 's lunch break , and he obligingly volunteered to be interviewed . ( At Air Canada shifts rotated ,  | three days , three nights , three off , but he swapped with other agents whenever he could to get the 6 A.M. shift . " Sixes are peaceful and I 'm up early anyway . " ) " Do n't you want to get something to eat ? " I asked . " Oh that 's all right . I never take anything but coffee , " he answered . And he suggested that he bring his coffee into the union office . Jack Burford was a warm , solid , methodical man who did n't seem particularly rushed . But it made me nervous to know that he had to be plugged back in in exactly twenty-nine minutes . So we got right down to cases while Meg puttered at the file cabinets . " Now my attitude on this electronic monitoring is , first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and then it 's got its good points in the respect that everyone has to pull his weight . " " What do you mean ? " " I started in reservations five years ago and I 'd never typed before so I was obviously very slow . " Jack had requested a transfer from the airport ramp because " I was getting to be of a certain age , and the wife was saying , Now you do n't want to work outside your whole life . ' " " When I came off the training I was put next to a couple of girls who would sit talking together for twenty minutes . We were having a seat sale then ; the phone lines were jammed up . I was busting my ass but I still could n't handle it all , and you 're sitting next to two people just talking ! " Back then , Air Canada had just installed the electronic monitoring , but the supervisors had n't learned what information they could get . They did n't know how to come to you and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Not plugged in . What was the reason ? ' When they did start using it to their advantage , taking people into the office and showing them their statistics , then I found the job easier , because everyone was pulling their weight . " Of course , there 's more pressure too . " Jack shifted to con- sider the other side of the question as if he were literally turning a heavy rock over in his hands . " The original system , you could sit and talk and do anything you wished as long as there was no red light . No call waiting . But under STAR and PASER you are plugged in automatically . Say it 's a Sunday or a long weekend and it 's dead . You ca n't say , Oh well , let 's leave one person and the rest , let 's have a coffee . ' It would show on your STAR that you 're out of line . It monitors you in eight-and-a-half hours less the thirty minute lunch and the two fifteen-minute breaks . And they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Up the equivalent of Kenny 's AHU , After Hang Up . " " Seventeen seconds , is n't it ? " I volunteered . " Or maybe eighteen , " said Jack . " I 'm not sure . " " Sixteen , " Meg piped up . " We lost a second in the last contract . " It was down to thirteen at American . " The point is , " said Jack , " not to let it dictate your way of life . I feel you can live with the machine and do your job if you do n't let it dictate how you do your job . " Like yesterday I had a customer called from Detroit , wanted to know the fares from Frankfurt , Germany , to Windsor for his son ? must have been in the U.S. forces . The fare I quoted the father ? he sounded quite elderly ? was well over $1000 . But I explained that I could halve it by booking from Frankfurt to Toronto and Toronto to Windsor . He was very pleased by that but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could I jot it down and post it to him , and he 'd send it on to his son who 'd make the booking from Frankfurt . " We do n't normally do that ' I said , but O.K. , I 'll do it for you . ' So I had to spend time , maybe fifteen minutes , out of line getting the letter out . But I was working and I do n't feel at all guilty . " " But , Jack , you were not only monitored out of line by STAR but you do n't get any credit for the booking from  | PASER . " I was beginning to distinguish between the two tracking systems . " Air Canada will still get the booking down the line , " he assured me . " And the customer will remember the service he got and call us the next time . " If my supervisor tells me , you did n't achieve 70 percent yesterday , only 68 , ' I still know I was doing my job . " ( The company standard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pointed out that if you deducted the sixteen seconds allowed for Clean Up between calls plus your two fifteen-minute breaks and your half hour lunch , this brought you down to 70 percent of your shift . So to meet the 70 percent , they reasoned , you had to be handling calls 100 percent of your working time . ) " By the way , " I asked , " which figure do they really care about , the seats booked or actually flown ? Which is your true bottom line ? " " That 's an argument I always have with my supervisor , " said Jack . " They want us to start pushing the bookings the way they do in the States . " For instance the last time I was listened in to I was told , There 's where you should have zoomed in on the sale . ' He should have closed , in American Airlines terminology . It was a man who wanted to take the wife and four kids to Calgary in the summer and we did n't have any reduced seats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did n't try to book . But I feel , what 's the point of offering a man like that first class ? I know he wants the cheapest seats . I know he will continue shopping . So what is the purpose of booking it ? " Personally , if someone calls me for a destination in the States and I can do it with three stopovers that will take him eight hours , I say , Call U.S. Air . ' " Meg winced at that name . " How are your statistics , then ? " I asked . I knew that was  | like asking a man 's income . But Jack gave me a straightforward answer . " Since I went on the union became a delegate my STAR is around 68 percent . Before that I averaged 71 . " " Wow . " " It 's not hard to achieve , but it requires 100 percent of your time doing your job . " " Do n't some people get a few free minutes by jamming ? " I suggested . Jamming is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just long enough to finish a conversation or take that last sip of coffee . " I would never do a thing like that , " Jack replied , truly disturbed . " Sometimes you get a dreadfully angry person on the line and if you take the trouble to find out what 's bothering him he may have been left on hold . I apologize in those cases and say , We 've been having a lot of that problem today . ' As if it might be a telephone line problem . It 's a white lie , but I do it . " I would never put anyone on hold except to get information for him . If one adds bad feeling to the world it comes back to one . " " But it is a regular practice , is n't it ? " I pushed . " Such agents are few and far between . " Jack insisted . " Personally , I do n't believe in any of those gimmicks . I just work at my own pace . If I 've got a businessman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meeting to call the airline ? say he had a reservation with a car arranged and a hotel booked , and he just wants to change it all for two days later ? a lot of people will hold that man on the line while they change all those items . The system allows you sixteen seconds Clean Up time . They do the Clean Up while they 're on the phone and they 've earned themselves sixteen seconds . " I personally do n't believe in that . As I talk I 'm jotting the information down on a pad on the side . I 'll let the client get  | back to his meeting . I tell him , I have the information and if I have any problem I 'll call his office . By doing that I 'm lowering my STAR . But the other way is a disservice to the client , and he will remember the service he got . " You could n't call Jack Burford a fanciful man . But he had a way of imagining , or perhaps feeling , the needs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The elderly gentleman with a son in the army and the rushed businessman were both very real and individual to Jack . And he responded to each of them with a subtlety that went far beyond selecting the appropriate pitch , probe or close . Furthermore , Jack had the flexibility to deal with situations that had n't been envisaged when the training manual was written . You would suppose that this subtlety and flexibility is what makes human beings desirable as reservation agents . But apparently not . Both American Airlines and Air Canada had arranged their monitoring and grading systems so that , no matter what your problem , Kenny and Jack got the most credit for asking , " Would you prefer the 10 o'clock or the 4 o'clock ? " Under the pressure of dailies , monthlies , PACERS and STARS , the human agent comes to sound annoyingly like a yes/ no , on/off , 10 o'clock/4 o'clock digital device . Perhaps this is a clue to the future of the job . When you hang up muttering , " I might as well be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be . At the time I interviewed Jack , Air Canada already had a self-booking machine on the drawing board . Like a bank money machine , it would be operated entirely by the customer . The machine would accept reservations and would also issue tickets , boarding passes and luggage tags . In a sense , the computer-aided clerk is merely a transition toward a machine . Jack Burford was n't making that transition gracefully . Though empathetic , Jack was n't a pliant man . The company could n't easily modernize his concepts of courtesy and decency.  | " I feel , " Jack declared , " that Air Canada is paying my wages , so I give them the best I can . But on the other hand , I do n't let them take over my life or my values . " This brought us to exactly 10:28 . Jack got up with a " Good-bye . If I can be of any more help ... " that did n't sound stressed or hurried . Without compromising his calm manner , his deliberate pace , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in time to be monitored in line before the computer 's clock moved from 10:30 to 10:31 . The day I arrived in Toronto , the headline in a major tabloid asked , " Are Canadians Boring ? " Before I left Toronto I ran into Jack Burford again . " Jack , " I said , " I now have a half dozen Canadian reservation agents down in these notebooks saying the same thing you said : I just work at my own pace . ' But how long do you think they can stick to it ? I know Canadians are kind of solid ... no , that 's not the word . . . maybe . . . ah ... " " Boring ? " he suggested . " Let 's say traditional , " I found a neutral word . " But still , wo n't monitoring eventually speed people up and make them handle the customers in a more programmed way ? " " It 's the customers that are getting programmed , " Jack an- swered . " They 're so used to dealing with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day that asked , Are you live ? ' I said , Well I was when I came in this morning . ' ' " And you do n't think the agents will eventually become more mechanical ? " " They 'll never speed us up like the Americans , " Jack assured me . " They will replace us with machines before they can turn us into machines . That 's why our union is trying for job security . We know we 'll be phased out in the next few years . So we want a contract where we can erode ourselves by retiring and quitting .  | " It 's a pity , really , " he mused . " Everything goes full circle , like that Anne Murray song Everything old is new again . ' It 's really a shame because basically people do n't like machines . They find them very impersonal . Then live agents will come back into fashion like something new again . " " But like everything quaint and old fashioned , " I said " they 'll probably be only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ special gold card number where people who paid a fee could speak to less-monitored agents . American Airlines had a similar flagship desk , primarily for travel agents. * " I do not look forward to the time when talking to a live person is a rich person 's privilege , " Jack said . " Yes , the new system is coming to Canada , too , but slower . " On the train ride home from Toronto , I had time to wonder why the new systems were coming to Canada slower . Air Canada used the same technology as American Airlines . Why had n't they scripted and speeded up the reservation conversation as thoroughly ? Was there something about the Canadian personality that resisted ? Possibly . It was hard to imagine Jack Burford learning a new sales pitch as quickly as Kenny . Was it the union ? It was certainly because of their unions that Canadian reservation agents had fixed schedules . So far the Canadian airline unions had also resisted the two-tier wage system that had turned reservations into a $5.77-an-hour job for new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposed individual monitoring . Though they had n't succeeded in keeping it out , they had  | at least taught their members that monitoring programs can be changed . For instance , Air Canada could collect statistics on the group without a breakdown on each agent . Such statistics would be useful for planning but not for discipline . In the blinking maze of a modern office , computers appear to monitor as automatically as clocks tick . But at Air Canada most of the agents understood that computers do n't time you unless they 're asked to . So perhaps it was the union 's in-depth education that softened the system . Or maybe Canadian reservation conversations were a little less rigid simply because Canadian airlines were still regulated . Perhaps they 'd adapt when they faced harsher competition . Was I observing a national character difference or just a fiveyear time lag ? By now I began to understand what reservation efficiency entailed . American Airlines had divided the two-minute reservation conversation into segments ? opening , sales pitch , probe and close ? and provided a set of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could now be put together like a mix-and-match outfit or a Chinese dinner ? one from column A , two from column B. On one level it 's obvious why this is considered efficient . In industry , production is routinely arranged so that the bulk of the work can be done with a minimum of skill . The more an airline can standardize the reservation conversation , the less they need to depend on the agents ' experience and judgment . This should make the agents cheaper and more interchangeable . It 's further argued , at least in manufacturing , that this process produces not only a cheaper worker but , also a more uniform product . At McDonald 's or General Motors , uniformity is considered a positive good . Is a more uniform conversation also a positive good ?  | As a customer I 'd like to reach an agent like Jack Burford who feels free to use his discretion and common sense . But airline systems aim at allowing Jack as little discretion and as little input as possible . Eventually booking machines may replace reservation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paying human salaries ( albeit only $5.77 an hour ) , why not take advantage of the qualities that make human beings better at communicating ? Why spend so much money and effort trying to replicate the perverse inflexibility of a machine ? I went back to Hartford to talk to Kenny 's boss at American Airlines . Everyone smiled when they mentioned Charles Zimmerli , the Division Reservation Manager at American Airlines . " Charlie is a people person , " said a supervisor . " He enjoys people so much . " Regardless of how routine their work might become , Zimmerli seemed able to make 650 reservation agents feel that , to him , they were far from interchangeable . I was glad I 'd have a chance to interview a " people person " about the human effects of reservation efficiency . On my way to Hartford , I stopped on the Lower East Side for hot bagels to bring to our 8 A.M. meeting . But despite fresh bagels and Zimmerli 's genuine warmth , our conversation took an unpeople turn at first . " Good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll nosh over there . " And he guided me to the round table near the window . He was a thin , dark-haired man with a glow of gray and a boyish smile .  | " Manning levels , " he began before I could even ask a question , " are one of our primary concerns . Let me give you some background . We have an Operations Supervisor who predicts the call level each day . And on that basis we offer something called Time-card Leaves ... " " T.L. , " I said . He tipped his head and continued . " One day last week our Operations Supervisor came exactly six calls short of predicting the exact call level . 17,929 calls predicted , 17,935 calls received . Just six calls under . " " Wow , " I said . " But what I really wanted to ask you about ... " " Yes , " he replied with pride . " We mentioned it in today 's newsletter . " He pointed to the bright-colored one-page news sheet lying on his desk . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but 800 ' calls from all over the country will get transferred to us if they 're undermanned somewhere else . We 've established that call length varies from region to region . ( We do our business quicker here in the East . ) Call length varies with the season , too . We 're able to predict for all that . That 's how we determine our own manning levels . " " I 'm interested , " I said , " in the way that the reservation phonecall can be designed to fit into such a . . . ah ... standard pattern . " " There 's what we call an opening to a sales call , " he explained . " I know , and a probe and a sales pitch and a close . " " Exactly . In the training program we have labels for certain types of selling . These become tools that a person is given to use and we expect certain results . We monitor to see that they get certain results from certain tools . You and I can listen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ordinary telephone on his desk . " We can listen and say , You were very supportive when you asked , " Does you 're granddaughter visit you often ? " You did n't make use of the name the way we taught  | you but your tone was good , your use of the probe was good . But , still , the person did n't book . ' " Now we set as a goal that the agent is supposed to convert a certain percent of these calls to bookings . " " What percent , by the way ? " I asked . " It changes , but I would say now about 35 percent . " I wondered if Kenny had been wrong when he told me that the conversion quota was only 26 percent . Had the standard jumped to 35 percent ? " Now , a person may feel depressed , " Mr. Zimmerli explained sympathetically , " when he does n't make his conversion rate . He says , I used all the tools but I did n't get the sale . Why are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That is why we are moving into a new system . " " A new rating system ? " " Yes , a rating system that talks more about their success in using the tools and less about their success in getting the booking . Of course , we 're still concerned about the number of people who board the airplane as a result of their effort . " Board under your sign , " I remembered Kenny 's phrase . We 're concerned about the customers not feeling pressured and the agent not feeling penalized . It 's the bookings that hold that will become the significant number starting with the new year . Just as Kenny had said . " As matter of fact , " Mr. Zimmerli continued , pointing through his open door , " we 're retraining people out there now for the new system . " I looked where he pointed . The Hartford office had once been a K-Mart department store . Now the agents sat at individual cockpitlike workstations dotting the cavernous shell . " Will there be a new rating sheet for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will stay the same , but now they will be rated for their effective use of the conversational techniques , not whether they make the conversion . "  | " Effective use of conversational techniques . " It seemed so subjective , like the wet onion slivers in a McDonald 's kitchen . " But that does n't yield a numerical value , " I said , surprised . " Oh yes it does , " he reassured me . " You used the probe technique or you did n't use the probe technique , you used the name or you did n't use the name . It 's not vague . It can be translated into a numerical determination that everyone can agree on ? the salesperson as well as those who are observing . " I decided to express what was troubling me . I did n't take down my own exact words but what I tried to say was : " Some people like to sell . To them it 's a challenge . Other people like to feel they 're doing a public service . The fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me that it 's not so easy to come up with an exact conversational scenario that fits all calls and feels comfortable to all agents . You are now changing the system because it was n't working for everyone . Why design a new system that again tries to anticipate every aspect of a two-way conversation and tries to prescribe a uniform response ? Why not let each agent handle it his own way ? assuming they all give the same fares and schedules , or course ? " Mr. Zimmerli was very patient . " Let 's go back to the first thing we were discussing ? manning . If we 're going to be able to predict manning I 've got to be able to develop some standards about what 's happening to me . This is a public-contact business . Planes get fogged in , people ask unexpected questions . So I 've got to systematize it somehow . " Now if Barbara is handling it in two minutes and getting good sales , he pointed to me as Barbara , making what I thought was an " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself is taking three minutes and getting good sales , I 'd rather employ Barbara . Those figures say to me , I 've got to talk to Charlie . I want him to get like  | Barbara . Let 's see what she does . ' Now I do n't want you to stop being Charlie . I want you to bring your Charliness with you , but lets see how we can tighten it . Let 's not ask how old is your mother or give them seven possible fares . That 's overservicing . " " But the former standardized phone call scenario " , I persisted , " was not the most effective phone call scenario for everyone . The new one may not be either . You hire human reservation agents because they are the only beings , organic or mechanical , that can respond with sufficient flexibility to an open-ended inquiry . Then you try in every possible way to restrict that flexibility . " " But I have to answer the phone American Airlines Reservations , ' " he said . " I ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's reservation office . ' Any employer-employee relationship requires a modification of my individualism . " Look , " Mr. Zimmerli picked up one of the bagels I 'd brought . " This bagel is created from a recipe in order to guarantee a great uniformity . " He paused to make sure I was following . " We are creating a product in reservations . Now you want a certain predictability in the product , do n't you ? " I remembered how I 'd gone all the way across Manhattan to get fresh bagels . " But I do n't want a frozen , packaged bagel . " " But you do want to know what you 're going to get . We at American aim at a certain level of standardization . " " And you can manufacture a conversation the same way you manufacture a bagel ? " " It 's a matter of degree . " We both agreed to that . But I do n't think we agreed what degree of standardization we should aim at , or why . I thought the reservation conversation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ current prices and correct flight times . As a reservations manager , Mr. Zimmerli needed a level of  | standardization that would allow him to count , time and grade each phone call . It was more im- portant , to have a quantifiable phone call than a flexible agent . Furthermore , Mr. Zimmerli assumed that centrally planned responses would almost always be superior to the decisions agents made on their own . I told Mr. Zimmerli about Jack at Air Canada , how he 'd spent fifteen minutes off the phone writing out rates for an elderly man whose son was going to book from Germany . Yet he did n't even bother to run down all the available rates to the man who wanted to take the wife and kids to Calgary on a summer holiday . " He 's overservicing , " Mr. Zimmerli objected to the first case . " He 's not giving the passenger the full range of services , " was the objection to the second . " Suppose it turns out that in making these two decisions Jack actually maximized Air Canada @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first call yielded a big booking in Germany and a loyal transatlantic customer . On the second call Jack was brief and kind to a man who was n't going to fly Air Canada in the end anyway . Let us just say those were the results . " " But they would n't be , not consistently , " Mr. Zimmerli insisted . " But if they were ? " My guess is that American Airlines would prefer a uniform or bagellike conversation , even if it had to be a little stale , to the effective but varied " product " Jack Burford produced by listening and using his own judgment . Mr. Zimmerli and I kept going around in circles debating whether Jack could possibly be as productive as an American Airlines agent . I 'm not sure we were really talking about the same thing . But we both agreed that Jack was one of a disappearing breed . Before I left , I asked Mr. Zimmerli whether he thought he could do his own job as manager efficiently if he were electronically tracked like the agents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He sometimes walked among the agents on the floor ; other times he met with workers or supervisors in his office . After people left his office he had to decide what to do about their problems . That was his own kind of AHU ( After Hang Up time ) . He wrote reports , he spoke to Dallas on the phone , he attended retirement parties and community functions , he dealt with reporters and he made decisions . " Not as many decisions as I 'd like , " he said . For instance , he would have liked to be able to recarpet the whole office but that had to be decided in Dallas . " Suppose , " I said , " the people in Dallas said to you , We trust you . We know you managers all work long hours . But some of the reservation offices are consistently more efficient than others . Since Charlie took over in Hartford ; the labor force had gone down from 850 to 650 while handling the same number of calls . I do n't know how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to record your time by plugging in at each workstation . That way we can tell you how the most efficient manager breaks down his activities . Then you can all follow that model . ' Would you personally like to work plugged in that way ? " I asked . " You mean if Mr. he named the president of the company could put a speaker in here and listen when we 're talking ? " " Yes . Or something like that . " " That would n't be appropriate , " he said " because my job includes personnel coming in and telling me they have a drug problem and other things that should properly be private . " " Well , O.K. " I conceded , " you could turn the speaker off the way the agents put their finger over the mike . " I unconsciously made the one-finger movement near my mouth . " Say , how many people have you talked to here ? " " About a dozen . " " I 'm just surprised the way you got that little gesture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | " Would you work well , and would you like it , if they tracked your different functions ? " " Yes , " he said without hesitation . " Yes , if it were explained to me that it was part of the efficiency of the entire company . Most definitely . " It 's lucky that Mr. Zimmerli would n't mind an executive tracking system , because that 's the focus of the most advanced efficiency research . Toward the end of our interview Mr. Zimmerli 's secretary came in , exchanged pleasantries and took the extra bagels for the women outside . He had a nice rapport with his secretary . As I left , Mr. Zimmerli again pointed to the newsletter on his desk and reminded me about the Operations Supervisor who had come within six calls of predicting the day 's call volume . As he guided me out , our path across the office was accompanied by a tinkle of " Hi , Charlies , " each synchronized with a smile and the one finger gesture to cover the mike . Near the elevator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ customer 's question . " The special meal on that flight is a stuffed tomato . The tomato is stuffed with shrimp and crab meat . It 's delicious . " " You must have eaten it on a recent flight , " I said . " You even know what it 's stuffed with . " She pointed to the screen , which described the tomato and its stuffing in big print . " It 's all in the computer . " When she finished the call she showed me how it scrolled easily to the vegetarian choices , then flipped back to the booking record . " What beautiful , clear print , " I responded enthusiastically . American Airlines has the most elegantly designed screens in the industry . Finding information is almost as easy as looking it up in a book . This is truly labor-saving design . The basic system for entering a reservation on a computer terminal , the system that makes a booking immediately available all over  | the country , is also labor saving ? and amazing ( despite occasional frustration at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monitoring is n't labor saving . The monitoring system at American Airlines does n't make it any faster or easier to say hello . It makes it easier to grade , time and set quotas . It 's labor controlling , but not labor saving . Now , as I was leaving American Airlines , I wished Mr. Zimmerli and I had spent less time talking about control systems and more about these wonderfully designed screens . " It 's so clear ! I 'd love to sit down and handle some calls right now , " I said . " Only I do n't know all the current information . " " That 's my problem , too , " said Mr. Zimmerli . " I ca n't work the thing like they can . " The agent smiled at this humble admission with its implied compliment . Mr. Zimmerli and I finally made it to the elevators amidst more smiles and waves . I descended to the lobby wondering how they are ever going to standardize what Charlie Zimmerli does to keep the Hartford office humming . As a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own common sense and good will . But airline automaters are willing to sacrifice his Jackness ( his Jackosity ? ) in order to get a more uniform conversation . Charlie Zimmerli also brings a lot of himself to a job that involves resolving problems on a broader scope . It would seem like a great waste of his Charliness to try to anticipate all the problems and provide him with a set of mix-and-match responses . Yet , as we 'll see in later chapters , the methods used to standardize reservation work are also being applied to management jobs . Just as airlines calculate the average AHU , effi- ciency experts now calculate how long it should take to write the average executive memo and even how long it should take to make the average executive decision . As this kind of efficiency moves up the occupational ladder , it yields not only diminished jobs but also diminished people . American Airlines did n't manufacture Kenny , the thirtyyear-old who has no plans for a family , no objection to moving , no one expecting him for dinner and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he serves their purposes awfully well . American has the computer capability to predict staffing needs by thirty-minute intervals . Kenny has the social capability to plug in and plug out as needed . But what use is Jack Burford , with a fixed mortgage , a fixed dinnertime , and a fixed philosophy of life ? What good is the capacity to reestablish staffing needs on a minute-to-minute basis if the workers insist on getting home when they 're expected ? What use is the latest survey on the effectiveness of every possible sales pitch when men like Jack are mired down in concepts of courtesy and honesty that they learned as children ? How can Air Canada compete with American Airlines if Canadians are stuck with old-fashioned employees like Jack ? My guess is that Charlie Zimmerli would probably find Jack a more sympathetic neighbor then Kenny . They 're of the same generation and they have similar feelings about family and loyalty . But I think Mr. Zimmerli will be hiring a lot more Kennys then Jacks . Soon it may be difficult to find many like Jack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meet many undergraduates going into social work . In part this is a matter of fashion . Poor people are out of style . Teaching similarly declines in prestige when children decline in prestige . But by now social work is n't just a less-prestigious or lowerpaid profession ; it 's hardly a profession at all . Of course the poor are still with us . So are the welfare centers . But these centers are no longer staffed by autonomous professionals . They 're staffed by increasingly regimented clerks . These automated welfare workers have no more chance to deal with people than do airline reservation agents . How can the " helping professions " be clericalized ? How can you eliminate the listening , talking , asking and advising from a job intended to help ? It sounds impossible to make social work as physically and mentally constrained as an assembly line job , but that 's exactly what 's being done . Up to now , the automation of human services has been slow and messy . In this chapter we 're going to look at a welfare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Industrial automation generally starts with a time-and-motion study . The purpose of such a study is to learn exactly what the job entails and then to break down all the necessary functions into their component tasks or details . This is called " rationalizing " the work . After a job has been rationalized , the workers will usually be given new tools or machines to speed up their now routine tasks . This second stage is called " mechanizing " the work . Owing to policy changes and budget cuts , the Welfare Department was never able to follow through from rationalization to mechanization . Automation hung suspended in midprocess for many years . I arrived just as the federal government stepped in to fund the mechanization stage . At the individual centers I could still observe the process of studying a job , dividing it into its component parts and re- turning it to the workers as a series of timed tasks . When rationalization is done " properly , " the new jobs should be easy to monitor and require only minor decisions by the workers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be replaced by lower-paid high school graduates . During the transition ? the attrition ? older social workers can see their jobs gradually downgraded . Newer workers may not know what the job used to be . Perceptions of movement , up or down , may be relative . But the overall direction is clear . When the process is complete there will be far fewer professional jobs in social work . It was ten years ago at a party that I met a woman named Catherine , who had quit her job as a social worker in Massachusetts . She 'd walked out on the day she was time-studied by outside consultants . " Your classic Charlie Chaplin efficiency men , " she recalled , " with watches and clipboards : answer phone , ten seconds ; pull case record , thirty seconds ; add a baby , six-and-a-half minutes . Oh , do n't mind us , ' she 'd mimicked the clipboard men , just work at your usual pace . ' " Soon after Catherine quit , a small group of her colleagues were moved out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ special cases like neglected children . They became part of the new Department of Social Services ( DSS ) and retained the title of Social Worker . But the vast majority stayed in the Welfare Department , where their titles were changed from Social Worker to Financial Assistance Worker ( FAW ) . At about the same time in other states Social Workers or Case Workers became Income Maintenance Workers or Eligibility Technicians . In the ten years that followed , welfare departments all over the country began to automate under a federally financed pro- by simplifying the paperwork . Instead , the were being used as the excuse or opportunity to transform professional . social work in to clerical tasks . I wondered what kind of streamlined work routines the early time-and-motion studies had yielded in Massachusetts . Catherine had no idea . No one she knew still worked in welfare . But by asking everyone who knew anyone I came up with a couple of names of people at , what I was assured , was " not the worst " center . With the usual trepidation , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) welfare center in Boston . " What have I got to lose ? " said Eddy Malloy , who had n't the slightest idea what I looked like or what I wanted . " You take the Green Line to , walk up St. past a permanent construction site and the third building is us . You 'll recognize it by the words OVERSEERS OF THE PUBLIC WELFARE ' right over the entrance ? carved in stone . " That 's some joke , " Eddy continued his telephone monologue . " Built as a welfare building , declared a national landmark , ca n't be torn down . Get the significance of that ? Welfare as a way of life , a permanent national system that ca n't be torn down . " Good start , " I wrote in my notebook , " a social worker who opposes welfare . " " Just go into the lobby , take a seat and watch your purse . " And does n't romanticize the clients . " I 'll come downstairs and meet you . " " I 'm short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That 's all right , I 'll call your name . " " You 'll call my name ? " " That 's my job . I 've got four-and-a-half years ' experience calling names of people who want to tell me their troubles . This time I 'll tell you mine . "  | " Erica Williams ! " A middle-aged black social worker looked calmly around the lobby until the skinny teenager sitting next to me rose tentatively from the wooden bench . " Come this way , Erica , " said the welfare worker in a serene contralto . They exited toward the interview room , the teenager carrying a blanket-wrapped package . " ... answer phone , ten seconds ; pull case record , thirty seconds ; add a baby , six-and-a-half minutes . " That 's what must be going on in the interview room , I realized , " add a baby . " But the process did n't appear particularly automated . I noticed a felt-pen sign on the receptionist 's counter . It said , " MONTHLY REPORT FORMS . " In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrows pointing down to a shoe box with a slit cut in the top . As an afterthought , someone had written " Thank you " on the sign in red ink . A shoe box with a slit does n't look like a high-tech operation , I thought . " You must be the writer . " Someone startled me as I was copying the sign . I turned and saw a very young man in rubber-soled shoes and thick-rimmed glasses . Actually Eddy Malloy was twentyseven . But he reminded me of the Mad magazine youths of my high school days . Computer hackers would be the modern equivalent , I suppose . I learned on the way to lunch that Eddy had graduated from college with a teaching degree but could n't get a job in Massachusetts , so he subbed for a while in New Hampshire high schools ? " Pick-up jobs , " he called them scornfully , " professional babysitting . " Finally he took a civil service test and wound up in the Welfare Department ? " It was supposed to be temporary . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On the weekends he  | supplemented his income ( Financial Assistance Workers , " FAWs , " then started at somewhat over $14,000 a year ) running a booth at a flea market . " I am , " Eddy declared , " the failure of the American dream . " " You mean that for every form you fill out , you have to fill out another form saying you filled out a form ? " " You 'll never be able to get this system straight , " Eddy expressed his confidence in me . For the entire lunch hour he 'd been trying to explain the point system that had evolved from the time studies . It went roughly like this : Time standards , in tenths of an hour , had been established for each function that an FAW like Eddy performs . For in-stance : Issue food stamp I.D . card meaning three-tenths of an hour , or 18 minutes Authorize funeral and burial expenses Replace lost or stolen check Complete redetermination The full list contained over sixty functions and was frequently updated . Each function @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actions , " such as going downstairs to see what the client wants , pulling the file , filling out several forms , distributing the forms to supervisors or the Electrical Data Processing center ( EDP ) , returning the case file . The original time studies had identified and assigned time standards for over 1000 actions . But how did they keep track of it all ? When a worker completed a function ? when , for instance , he handed his supervisor the forms necessary to record a change of address or a change of food stamp benefits ? he  | filled out an additional form called a " control slip . " At the end of the month the supervisor used these control slips to count the number of points ( tenths of hours ) each worker had earned . It was remarkably like the piece-work system in a mink factory I had visited . There , as you finished cleaning each pelt you tore off a tag and tossed it into a cigar box for the supervisor to count . Here , as you finished adding a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the welfare center the control slip was sometimes called a " penny slip , " just as it is in a garment shop . ) At the end of the month the supervisor counted the worker 's points , his tenths of hours , and calculated how close he came to using 100 percent of his available time . Each worker received a monthly report card with a percentage grade . So far a worker was n't disciplined unless he fell below 70 percent . That was the system after the time study but before full computerization . " So these control slips mean you fill out a form for every form you fill out ? " I asked incredulously . " You 'll never get it down straight , " Eddy assured me . " They keep changing everything anyway . " I 'm not sure whether I did n't understand it or I just did n't believe it . Perhaps the system would seem less cumbersome in practice . " Hi , Opal . " " Is this letter O.K. ? " A glamorous blonde handed Eddy an envelope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ center returning from lunch . ) " It would be better if they said they terminated you instead of you terminated , " he said scanning the letter . " But I 'll put it through . It 'll qualify your kids . I 'll have to ask about you . " " Thanks . "  | " Will you get credit for that ? " I asked as we watched Opal tip down the street on her stilettos . " If I open her up , I 'll get the credit . " " What ? " " Just talking is n't an action , " Eddy explained . " Opal earned over 150 percent of her budget the week before last as a Kelly Girl , and the downtown computer automatically threw her off . I spent half an hour this morning telling her how to get back on . I wo n't get credit for that . And I wo n't get credit for taking the letter now . But when I make up a T.D . Turnaround Document and an MRW Monthly Report Worksheet and send it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see . " " Opening a case is an action according to the department ; talking to people about their status is not . But they 'll open her up and there 'll be no problem . " The phone rang as we entered Eddy 's office . " Sandra O'Malley ? " he asked the receptionist downstairs . " What time is it ? ... After 2 I do n't cover O ' . " But he went downstairs anyway to help a Hispanic teenager who wanted to register a change of address . She handed Eddy a copy of a rent receipt with her new address . He excused himself to make a photocopy . While I waited with Sandra , I overheard a welfare worker in the next cubicle appealing , " But I hate to use up your Emergency Assistance for $57 . Do n't you have a friend you can borrow from ? " Eddy returned with the rent receipt , warned Sandra that her next week 's food stamps would still come to the old address and wished her good day . " An ex-boyfriend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a heavy , disheveled social worker still pleading , " If you came with a $1000 gas bill I could pay half of it . But this , I can only pay $57 out of the $70 and you use up your emergency  | assistance for the whole year . If God forbid you have a big emergency , I need something to help you with . If I were you ... " " She used to be a welfare mother herself , " Eddy explained . " She came up to me yesterday all flustered because she 's going on Corrective Action for falling below 70 percent . " " Is that because she gets so involved with the clients ? " I asked . " Mostly she 's just a disorganized mess . But I 'll get her off . Eddy handles grievances , though he 's at odds with the union on many questions . I do n't know what she gets so upset about . It 's her third time on Corrective Action . It 's just a game . " Before we left the lobby Eddy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sign something and told a third to come back with a rent receipt . " What we run here is a garage , " he explained as we walked upstairs . " They come in for air , a valve job , oil . It 's a service station , that 's all . Only some people do n't realize that yet . What happened to Debby the former welfare mother/social worker I 'd overheard is she spent a lot of time on the phone dealing with some disaster . In this system you do n't get points for that and if you do n't have the mental capacity to make up the time , you wind up on C.A. Corrective Action . But I 'll get her off . They just want to give her grief . " It took Eddy over five minutes in the file room to find Sandra O'Malley 's old record , bringing him close to the eighteen minutes ( .3 ) allowed for an address change even before he started the paperwork . " Not that you ca n't make it up , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the woman I got this card from ? She picks up her checks at the center because of broken mailboxes . All I have to do is have her sign for the check when I go back down . It 's an easy .3-if you 're into playing games for points . "  | Back in his office , before he could write up the O'Malley address change , Eddy was interrupted by a tired-looking woman . She was the third worker so far to ask him about new procedures . " This , " said Eddy , pointing to a box on a form , " tells you to do nothing . The machine has already sent out a letter terminating her . If you want to change it , you 'll have to send a form to EDP by 3 o'clock . " It was 2:40 . The tired woman sighed . " Velgumbia ? " Eddy said into the phone . He keyed up the name on a terminal that sat on the otherwise empty second desk in his office . ( Though the state had compiled an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the local offices . Eventually the FAWs would enter their paperwork directly onto computers . But for the present it was a one-way terminal , available only for research . Eddy was one of the few workers who used it . ) As the name came up on the screen , Eddy said , " It 's her check day . I can pick it up on the way down and have her sign for it . " " Notice what else I 'm doing , " he said , pointing out his own efficiency . " I 'll need the zip code to complete O'Malley 's address change . I remember there 's another client on the same block so I look her zip code up here he filled in the form as he spoke and I save myself a walk down the hall to the zip code book . " I decided not to accompany Eddy downstairs this time . " It 's getting to be too many inputs for me , " I sighed . Eddy seemed adroit at following the rules , getting his points and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had begun only four-and-a-half years ago , when the workers were already called FAWs . I wondered about the long-term workers who had entered the field when the job was called Social Worker and included home visits . Were they able to juggle all these balls in the air at once ?  | " Are there any long-time workers I could talk to ? " I asked Eddy when he returned . " I 've had thirteen supervisors in two-and-a-half years . It 's a high-turnover job . Anyway , the end of the month is not a *odd time to talk to people , because anybody who takes the point system seriously is out there hustling for points . " " What about you ? How many points have you gotten since I 've been here ? " " Let 's see , since lunch I 've seen six people and I 'll get points for three of them . That 's a 50 percent average . Not too bad . For me it 's a system to be beaten . I 'm dyslexic . I had to beat the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be brilliant . You handle grievances , you answer my questions , you give clients time you do n't get credit for and you 're dyslexic . How do you manage to make your points ? " " Want to look at my report card ? " He handed me his official Worker Summary ( WS-1 ) for the month of March . After deductions for priority assignments , labor relations and a snow day , Eddy had 119.25 " available hours for standard work " ( line 2 ) . In that time his " total earned hours " were 95.3. ( line 3 ) . That gave him a " productivity % " ( line 2 divided by line 3 ) of 80 percent with an accuracy rating of 100 percent . " It was a bad month , " he apologized . " You usually get higher than 80 percent ? " " I aim at 70 percent . I can usually manage to keep it down to 71 or 72 . But sometimes when you get close to the end of the month you lose track @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ points down at the same time as everything else ? " " You want to watch me earn some points since you 're worried ? " Before my eyes Eddy rapidly completed the address change , which consisted of three documents clipped to the photocopied rent receipt . The top form , the control slip , required nothing but his I.D . number , the name of the proce- dure and the date . Yet for Eddy that was somehow the last straw . For the first time he dropped his cool , just-playingtheir-game tone and became angry . " Look at these control slips . Three copies , three colors , 24 t each just for the paper . You know what it costs the taxpayer to have me fill out this form each time I do an action ? It 's asinine ! " Abandoning my interview style I expressed my own guess that the control slip was just a transitional phase ; it could n't possibly be the permanent monitoring system . Of course , it had been the system most of the years Eddy had worked for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would eventually move toward electronic monitoring . Eventually the FAWs would enter their work directly onto the computer , which would tally their points continuously . Eddy doubted that they 'd ever let the FAWs enter information directly onto the master files . He thought it would make it too tempting to create fictional recipients and collect checks . But in any case , he did n't fear computers . After all , the electronic master recipient file was the only development since he 'd been there that actually helped him with his paperwork . " Working directly at a terminal could mean a lot less paperwork , " I said . " But at the same time they could program it so you 'd be completely controlled every minute . You would n't be able to borrow time from checks to talk to Opal . Are n't you worried about a huge speed-up ? " " Speed-up ? " He shrugged . " This place is under court order to hire minorities and women . Which means that the standards are always gon na have to be slow enough for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are smarter than blacks or women ? " " If I were smart I would n't be here , would I ? "  | " I 'm so glad I talked her out of it , " said Debby Kesselman , the heavy-set , disheveled worker I 'd seen previously . " Actually she needed $70 to keep her going and all I could have given her was $57 . I just hated to see her spend her E.A. Emergency Assistance on a $57 light bill . " Debby 's desk and floors were covered with case files ; each one a soap opera of its own . " I had a pregnant girl who was so messed up , I mean physically , that I told my supervisor I 'm taking her to the hospital right now . I did n't ask my supervisor , I told her . She was spewing blood clots from her lungs ? this is while I was interviewing her . " As it turns out , Tammy is twenty years old with the mind and body of a fourteen-year-old . Her baby was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see the new baby , but you have to be a relative to get into intensive care . So we said I was the baby 's grandmother . Tammy was delighted ; I was proud . It was so silly . Especially since the baby was obviously all black . " Although Debby is white , one of her own four children is black . When they were little , Debby told me , her mother regularly sent three Christmas presents , which Debby sent back with the note , " You have four grandchildren . " Perhaps that 's what makes her so sensitive about rejected children . And rejected mothers . " I wish I could have taken her home when she got out of the hospital . Some people have nobody . Just nobody . " " What does your supervisor say when you come back late from the hospital or spend so long downstairs with a client ? " " I have a friend in the unit . We cover for each other 's phones , even run down and take each other 's clients sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on your paperwork , " I said , looking around the room . " These E.A.s are a legal priority . You have seven days to file the work . I 'm twenty to thirty days behind now . " But you see I have my own priorities . Like never hold a baby . You put that form through right away . Because if there 's a medical problem with a newborn I do n't want there to be any question about getting it into a hospital . " " But how do you manage to get your points ? " " This point system turns you into a machine instead of a social worker ! " she declared . " You do n't get any points for keeping a case open by reminding a feeble-minded woman where she 's got to go for her baby 's Social Security number . It 's easier to get your points by letting a case terminate and then reopening it . But who can do that ? " Maybe there are some people who can turn in their points and not care whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , serving the clients is more important than the Points . " The beginning of this month I said , I have a funny feeling I 'm gon na go on C.A. and I do n't give an F.U. ' If you 're out there giving service , " she said with bravado , " you should n't worry whether it 's going to take five minutes or an hour . " " How will you feel when they finally get this job on computers ? " I asked . " Well , " she sighed , scanning the clutter , " if it gets rid of some of this paperwork ... " Kevin Kennedy is a handsome man in his midthirtics . He serves as a kind of senior advisor to the antibureaucratic guerrilla forces still operating at NTW . A young cadre , including Eddy , was planning tactics in his office when I arrived .  | Kevin : Look she was closed off on the twenty-fourth ; they recertified her on the twenty-seventh ; so we can base it on the last thirty days . You follow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know what I can do and I know what they 're gon na say . Kevin : No , no . Here I 've got it . He reached up to the shelf behind him for a huge looseleaf procedure manual . Like all good guerrilla commanders he trained his troops to use the enemies ' weapons . Do you know what a cyclical month is ? Unidentified Female FAW : Whether the case is looked at retrospectively or prospectively they 're gon na put her on MR and she 's gon na be screwed out of her food stamps . Kevin : The food stamps have to be looked at prospectively because you do n't eat retrospectively . Wait , here , I 've got it .... Like Eddy , Kevin takes pride in circumventing the system in order to make it work . But he also enjoys the clients . One of his proudest .3 activities that day was closing the case ? " I knew you 'd be a success ! " ? of a nineteen-year-old mother who 'd gotten her high school degree and found a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one more check , " Kevin suggested . " You 'll have expenses before you get your first paycheck . " But it was getting harder to slip in that last welfare check now that W-2s were on computers . Anyway , the young woman was impatient to get off welfare . In the lobby Kevin was stopped by a teenager who wanted a medical note to excuse her from E.T . " E.T. , like the movie ? " I asked . " Exactly , " said Kevin . " Educational Training to prepare you for Extra Terrestrial jobs . " But the bulk of his time was spent untangling confusing communications between the clients and the Welfare Department . " Did you get a letter from me ? . . . No that 's a redeter- mination appointment , the other letter . . . . O.K. , that 's from the computer . Next MR you get I want you to submit this pay stub with it and we 'll see if it goes through. ? Or the now-familiar Utility Emergency : " You bring in that electric @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .... You bring in the bill this afternoon , as soon as you can .... I 'll be here . " He repeated it all several times to a blue-eyed , pink-cheeked girl , who seemed peculiarly vague and unconcerned for someone who just had her electricity turned off Kevin explained to me that she was border-line retarded , " able to live alone , but with little sense of time or urgency . For instance , her electric has already been off for several weeks . " I learned from Kevin that he could in fact get credit for talking to her . When a client comes in on a Utility Emergency Kevin should , according to department procedures , fill out a Notification Form Letter ( NFL ) . " If I filled out the NFL the client would have four days to appear with the bill and I would have seven days from the initial request to respond . For filling out the NFL , Kevin would earn " But I will not do NFLs ! " he said emphatically . " First of all , I refuse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told someone to bring In one piece of paper . " But mostly I do n't do it because if she does n't get back here in the four days it 's a big hassle to get it open again . What 's the sense of starting a time clock on a person who could n't get it together to pay her electric bill on time in the first place ? What 's the sense of starting procedures that will enmesh a person who is n't good at coping anyway ? " " What 's the sense " is a phrase Kevin feels free to use as he applies and manipulates the department 's regulations . It makes sense to Kevin to squeeze in one more check for a welfare client starting a job . Without something to tide her over she might bounce right back onto welfare for lack of a  | babysitter , appropriate clothing or even the carfare to get to work . And to Kevin it makes sense not to fill out an NFL on the Utility Emergency of a feeble-minded client even though it costs him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harder , even before full computerization , for welfare workers to find these areas of discretion . It was also getting harder for the welfare workers to know enough to give the clients useful off-the-record advice . The rules on food stamp , entitlement are so complicated that it used to take a long calculation , figuring in income , rent , dependents and so on to come up with the allotment for each family . Formerly , the welfare worker made these calculations at his desk and told the client right then what his food stamp grant would be . But now the worker merely takes down the information and sends it upstairs to EDP . There the data processing clerk enters it into the computer , which makes the calculation . The client is informed of his food stamp allotment later . Every worker I talked to was happy to be relieved of the tedious food stamp calculation . But it left them less useful to the client . Newer workers who 'd never done the calculation themselves could n't estimate for a client that cutting her rent from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family poorer . " I happen to have made a food stamp chart to handle that problem , " Kevin told me when I brought up the issue . He pointed proudly to a geometric crayoned design on the wall that I had taken to be a child 's artwork . Kevin 's food stamp chart was an ingenious multicolored graphic that indicated at a glance what various budget changes would mean for different-sized families . Actually , it was n't one chart but a sheaf of papers . " I revise it every time the regulations change . Lots of people Xeroxed this chart , " he told me proudly . " They even use it down in Intake . "  | Despite Kevin 's chart , clients were more and more often hearing , " I ca n't answer that question . The computer will let you know . " I outlined the same scenario to Kevin that I 'd tried on Eddy : an automated system with FAWs at terminals entering the data onto electronic forms ; eligibility determinations made inside the machine ; the computer also programmed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why not have the client enter his data himself ? " Kevin suggested , carrying my fantasy one step further . " He comes in and goes to a screen that says My problem is A , house burned down ; B , new baby ; C , change of address . ' " " Why not ? " I agreed excitedly . " The customer enters his own data on a bank money machine . It 's the obvious next step . But Kevin was only kidding . " There 's too many parts to the job and too many exceptions to ever get it onto a program , " he said confidently . " As a matter of fact , there 's so much to know that there 's only one person in the department who knows it all . That 's me . So I 'm not worried . " Before Welfare had been reorganized , with the Department of Social Services ( DSS ) split off , two black welfare recipients took advantage of a 1960s social program to become welfare employees . They started as clerks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full-fledged social worker . When the split came , one of them , Ellen Jones , was moved up into the DSS to handle foster children . The other , Jo Martin , stayed in welfare where her newly earned title , Social Worker , was changed to FAW . In my quest for a long-term social worker who 'd seen the job change , I phoned Ellen Jones . Ellen felt that her job at  | DSS was still basically social work . If I was interested in the changes , she suggested I look up her friend Jo . " I 'm embarrassed . I have n't called her in so long . But I 'm sure you 'll get honest responses from her . " " That 's her , " said the man , pointing to a desk by the side wall . Josephine Martin did n't look like my imaginary Jane Addams social worker with a grey bun and sturdy walking shoes . She was a tiny woman with flimsy shoes and short , fuzzy hair that you could n't quite call a natural . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She was pulling pieces of paper out of an overstuffed folder , looking them over and tucking them back in , the way a bird would tuck and smooth the raggedy wisps around her nest . Watching Josephine perched on her chair with one leg curled under her , I realized why all the women in my family sit that way . Our legs are also too short to reach the ground . When I introduced myself she stood up for a moment and we both smiled broadly , perhaps from the mutual enjoyment of being small . And when we learned that we each had one child , raised alone ? " Juliet is sixteen . " " Jerome is twenty-six . " ? we understood the pleasure welling in each other 's smiles . " His eight-year-old daughter is living with me now , " Jo said , " so I know how much fun you had raising a little girl . " Something about her invited me to say true things . " People often congratulate me for raising a child alone . But you know , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easier than with two parents . " " I know what you mean , " Jo answered with the same freedom . " If my husband had n't been killed I 'd have had two kids to take care of instead of one . " " Oh , I 'm sorry , " I apologized , " I assumed you were divorced or ... " " Oh , that 's all right , " she comforted me . " I loved my life  | with my son . And if my husband had lived , " she said cheerfully , " I 'd never have been able to go to college or be a social worker . " I made a note to get back to that . " How are you managing with the point system ? " I asked , knowing that Jo was barely making her 70 percent each month . " It 's awful , it 's hideous . If I do this whole redetermination , " she said , lifting the bulging file on her desk , " all I get is 1.8 . But take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the folder , " if I did it alone , it would be .7 just by itself . " " What 's a WTP ? " I asked . " It 's if a client 's kid has turned six and the mother is home , I have to register her for work training . " " I never heard of that one . " " It 's like the old WIN program . " " Oh , yes , I remember the WIN program . It decimated my daughter 's day-care center . " " Then there 's the A and the FS and the EA1 and the . . . " She saw I could n't get it all down and she backtracked . " Before we can do the reedy redetermination , we have to take the case , every case , and go through every pocket , " she illustrated again with the same tattered file , " find out what has to be done , purge the case ? that 's pull out any material two years old or older . All that is no points @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not . " Then we get maybe two , three hours for a case . Some cases are like that . Just a person with one child . But then come the ones with two , three kids and changing schools and changing grants and do everything else . And that 's just forms . That 's not interviewing ; that 's not social work . " Look at this , " she began pulling forms out of her middle drawer . " If the child has turned six you do this one . If the child has not turned six you do that one . " As she named each  | item , she slapped another form down on the desk . " If the child is over sixteen you got to send out an SV1 . If there 's income you fill out an MR . Then you got to get everybody 's Social Security number . Only they have n't got a Social Security number for the baby yet . So you 're angry at them because you got your forms to fill out . Then you 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summary ATP . . . . " She was pulling forms out of the drawer with such accelerating anguish that I felt I had to stop her before she crashed . " How many forms do you think there are all together ? Did you ever count ? " " I do n't know . Whenever you start to count you 'll always find more . Look , here 's one , " she said reaching way back into the drawer . " If they were on Blue Cross/Blue Shield at one time but they 've stopped working ... . " I have to do forty-eight , forty-nine complete reedies a month to make my quota and send out maybe seventy , eighty letters . Josephine 's job at the time was just redeterminations , with no case maintenance . The way it is now you 're not a social worker , you 're an FAW . If you take ten minutes out to help one kid in a family you 're gon na ' fall behind . " " What do you mean ? " " If they say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know where to take him ' I do n't say , What 's the matter ? ' I say , I can recommend you to Project Good Health . ' And I do n't even look . " Now if you is a person with a problem , you do n't want to just tell it to everyone . You want to feel it out first . This worker , does she have some sensitivity to my problem ? Can she hear me ? ' But I ca n't hear her . I ca n't listen to her . I 'm just trying to get my points . The whole system is survival . And she goes away feeling as bad or worse than when she came down here . " See , some people come here , they know the welfare system better than I know it . They just want to get their full grant and leave .  | " But some people come here , they are at the end of their rope . They think , You is a social worker . That 's something . Maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me about a child that is getting out of hand , starting to drink , not coming home . " If she says , Mrs. Martin , he acts up . He really hurtin ' himself . But he is a good boy , ' and I say , I can refer you to the Department of Social Services , ' she 's gon na say , Oh , that 's all right . ' What she 's thinking is , They 're gon na take my child . ' " You got ta understand , " Jo pleaded with me , " these people are up from Alabama with very little education . " " Where are you from , by the way ? " " Alabama . Came up here at sixteen with my husband . " But Jo was still concentrating on the other woman 's story . " See , she 's just afraid they 're gon na take her child away . " " And the one with the worst fear is the one least able to help the kid herself , " I suggested . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stamps for her . But they do n't want food . It 's not that kind of life-and-death . They want to talk to you about a problem . " I do n't like to look off into the distance , cut them off , say , Oh , yes , I understand . ' You do n't understand ! You ca n't understand if you ca n't listen ! " I 'm her worker , I 'm the one she asked , and I look away . If I say DSS she gon na say , Oh , that 's all right , ' and you wo n't hear from her again till the problem gets so bad that the child is in jail . " Jo 's anguish has been building . Now the knot in her throat seemed to subside a bit . " Before , in the old system , she 'd be in here in a week if the child do n't want to go to school or starts drinking . Before , when we used to make house calls here Jo took a little metal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone would tell me her daughter was staying out all  | night I would say , Let me come around after school tomorrow and talk to the child by myself ' " See , I had my box with all my clients arranged in order of the streets . " She opened the box lovingly as she named Boston streets . " I learned what streets were next to what and I 'd organize my box like that . And some of them would give me phone numbers that were n't for the case records . Just for my box . So I could call to make an appointment . I did n't have to send out letters . And they knew I was coming , and they 'd be there , and they 'd have all their documentation in the house . Or they 'd call and say , I ca n't find the stubs or the rent receipt , ' and they 'd make another appointment for a different day . So I did n't have to close the case . " " People must have trusted you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She smiled , " Things went faster when you were doing them over coffee , " and continued her reminiscence . " I could get to five , six people in a day and complete all their cases . I could make time to talk to a child , plan to get there when she came home from school . " Jo 's memories of five successful home visits in one afternoon were as shiny with time as her worn-down file box . There must have been days she traipsed around her district and reached no one at all . And surely there were other days she left the center at 2 o'clock and went straight to the movies with little Jerome . ( Also socially useful work . ) But I was beginning to believe she had a talent for the social work that was no longer a part of her job . " What might you say to that girl who 's started staying out all night ? " I asked . " It 's more a matter of listening than what you would tell them , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the child about sex , ever . But when they find they can talk to you about it they might ask , What he want me to do , Mrs. Martin , is it fair ? ' "  | " My boyfriend wants me to move in with him , Mrs. Martin , " I said . At that time in my life , I needed a social worker too . " To set up a home together , that is . But he has four teenage children of his own . " She was now listening very professionally . Which is to say like a good friend . " Four ? " " Yes , twelve to seventeen . " " And your daughter has had Mommy all to herself till now ? " " Yes , " I nodded . She looked at me and described the scene . " So his children will come over for weekends ... " " It 's not weekends . It 's joint custody . He feels very strongly about that . Though it is n't worked out yet . It keeps changing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while and they see their father living full time with this other child . Meantime , your daughter is invaded by four large teenagers . She 's screamin ' , Ma , get them out of my room ' " " I do n't think she 'd ever actually scream like that . " " So she 's clenching her fists silently and gritting her teeth at you , Why do n't you rescue me ? ' " " I guess I did n't really train her to be too adjustable . " " Now do n't talk adjustable . ' You and she share a wonderful home together . I can tell by the way you smile . You made a home that was right for you two . You do n't want to lose it . And what you and this man have together I 'm omitting some of the little things I 'd already told her about Bill could also be lost in that house . " I nodded . It all sounded true , but .. . " Your daughter 's sixteen , right ? " Once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to think of Juliet , sixteen . " She gon na go to college , maybe ? " " Probably . "  | " Now this man , he wants to live with you and make a home for ever and ever ? " " Right . And I 'm beginning to think it might work . " " Listen , if this is supposed to be forever , then why ca n't he wait two more years ? Would n't that be fair ? " " Why , of course , " I said . " Of course . " I wondered if the fifteen-year-old girl who was starting to stay out all night would feel as relieved after talking to Jo as I did . Two more years while we both work on our own families , then move in together when we can concentrate more on each other . " So what you got ta do in the meantime is ... " She was interrupted by the phone . " It 's the director . She wants to see me right away in her office . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I thought about how quickly she 'd understood my problem . Is that because we 'd led similar lives as single mothers ? But Jo came up North with her husband at sixteen . When she went back to high school for her equivalency diploma she got out of class at seven minutes to 9 . At 9 o'clock she had to be home to put Jerome to bed . And the house had to be spotless , everything cooked and cleaned , or she could n't go to school . After her husband was killed on a construction job , Jo started college . Was her experience really like mine ? When Jo talked about her clients she assumed their accents ? " He hurtin ' himself . But he 's a good boy . " ? and their feelings , too . When she listened to me she was hearing a middleclass , New York writer . But I had no doubt she was truly hearing me . Jo Martin did n't have a bun or wear Red Cross shoes , but she could remember back to the days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had a true vocation . I guess I 'd finally met my old-fashioned social worker who 'd seen her profession scaled down to paperwork.  | Jo was not good at the paperwork . She faced each client 's redetermination the way I face my income tax returns . Forty-nine rederterminations a month is only a little over two a day . Any monthly quota with welfare recipients as the raw data is bound to be frustrating . There are always so many loose ends hanging out of each folder . But it 's not really a high quota . The fact is that Jo Martin is not an efficient FAW . But a human service department that 's organized so it ca n't use her true skill is profoundly inefficient . " The director asked who you were , " Jo said when she returned . " I told her you were doing an interview about my life starting with how I came up from the South . I told her you 'd been at DSS , too . Next time you should go to the administration first , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Maybe I will , next time . " Jo gave me her home phone number and reminded me to give her regards to Ellen . " No , " she answered my final question , " I would n't take this job the way it is now . But I been here so long and I 'm forty-six . " I left , hoping I had n't gotten her into trouble with the director . Several people ' had described Daniel Sheridan as the fairest and most efficient supervisor at NTW . " Straight arrow " was the phrase that kept coming up . Daniel 's shining , boyish face seemed to fit the description . So did his shiny-clean desk . On a table near the door where the five FAWs he supervised were to place their finished work , Daniel had taped four neatly lettered signs : REDTS , CASE MAIN , PRIORITIES , and REDTS WITH CORRECTIONS . The four spaces were all empty . An FAW popped in as we were leaving  | for lunch . " Just a quick question . I got a woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she needs her own food stamps . " Daniel advised him on the quickest procedure . As we walked toward the restaurant I took notes on his personal history : twelve years with the Welfare Department ; three years as a supervisor ; married ; two children ; a former policeman , who transferred to Welfare when he was injured . Glancing over my shoulder , I suppose to check my facts , he asked , " Is that your own shorthand ? " " It 's my actual handwriting . " " Mine is bad too , " he commiserated , " because the nuns made me write with my right hand . They threatened to break my arm if I kept up left-handed . " " Oh dear , " I shuddered . " But still , " he said , " I wish there were more Catholic schools , for the discipline . " Good ! Catholic-school boy , ex-policeman , pro-discipline : Daniel Sheridan should have a proper management mentality . When we were seated and served , I posed my first question as open-endedly as I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standards and the point system ? " " I blame the union for the way it 's operating , " Daniel answered concisely . " You mean because they 're sabotaging it ? " " No , because they 're not sabotaging it . " " What do you mean ? " " If they followed the rules as the department issued them , this system would have collapsed in three months . " " You want it to collapse ? " " If I were a worker and a union activist , " Daniel said , " the first time I did 100 percent in the first three weeks of the month I 'd stop work . And if they tried to make me do anything over 100 percent , I 'd fill out an overtime form . " The problem , " he declared , " is that all the workers have  | developed systems of their own to get the points they need and still deliver a timely service . That 's what keeps this place going . " " But why do you , as a supervisor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " First of all , because keeping track of points makes more work for me . Second because I am a fellow worker and I see where this system is leading . " " By the way , " I asked , " how do you keep track of all those control slips ? It seems like you could spend half your time on that alone . " " You could , " he said , " but I have my own system . What I do is make a file for each worker for each week and arrange their control slips by the number . All the .3s , all the .2s , all the . ls . " The workers all claim to be against the system but they do n't actively pursue it to the point that the system would collapse . " What I see them do is go for their 70 percent or their 100 percent or whatever they want and then bank their penny slips for the next month or trade them around . Or help out someone who ca n't make it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explained to the workers where this system is going . " " What do you mean ? " " I have been told at a training session for supervisors that eventually they wo n't have to put in the penny slips . Every action the worker does will go directly onto the computer and be counted automatically . Instead of tallying their points I could go over to the computer and it would say this is the fifteenth day of the month , number zero zero zero has earned eighty-six hours of credit . " At another of the classes I attended , a woman from Washington suggested that eventually welfare will be run like Social Security . You fill out a form and you get your check .  | " For the worker that means you do n't have to talk to the client . You just take down the information , put it in the computer and the computer makes the decision and gives out the money . " " Or the client can input the information himself , " I suggested . " Like you do at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ philosophy of Monthly Reporting , " Daniel responded . " Even now the worker only checks information to transmit it to the computer . He has no determination as to the budget . If the client does what he 's supposed to , there is no judgment and no intercession by the worker . There is no real welfare worker . " But , " said Daniel , searching for the brighter side , " the machine does n't always work . And when the computer makes a mistake it can be by thousands of dollars . For instance , a woman added a new child to the budget and , because of a glitch in the program , every month for the next few months it kept adding a new dependent . She owed us three or four hundred dollars . Also , " he said hopefully , " there are frauds whereby a client and a worker , or even a worker alone could ... " After a consoling digression on the possibilities of larceny and computer error , Daniel returned to his sober analysis . " Right now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system work . Instead of using their own shortcuts , they should follow all the rules and collect all the points they 're entitled to and let the system collapse . " Daniel Sheridan struck me as a profoundly good , courteous and organized man . His natural inclination was to solve problems and to make things work for people . I wondered if he would have the conviction to carry out the policy he advocates were he an FAW . Was he stubborn enough to say , " If they want me to act like a machine , then I will ? no matter how  | much inconvenience it caused for clients and fellow workers ? It would be a severe test of his inherent decency . From what I 'd observed , Daniel was correct . The welfare center was working now , in its own peculiar way , because each worker balanced the rules of the point system against his own individual rules of public service and common sense . Debby and Jo harked back to an earlier era of social work . Many of the services they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Kevin and Eddy , younger and brasher , were a product of the current era . They applied their legalistic minds to distributing the entitled benefits rapidly and according to the rules . But the small amount of discretion they were allowed was used to tip the see-saw toward the recipient or at least to head off Kafkaesque entanglements . They took it upon themselves to act as ombudsmen . Personally , I favor a welfare system with the least possible worker intervention . I think the most efficient plan would be to send every man and woman in the country a $10,000 check each year . This would eliminate all eligibility decisions except alive or dead . But in the meantime welfare requires each person to tell his story and prove his need . It requires a judgment about each dollar in each case . One goal of welfare automation is to take every aspect of this overly complex judgment away from the welfare worker and have it made inside the machine ? which is to say , at a higher level . The aim is to restrict discretion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local offices . But what would happen in those local offices if workers complied by becoming as mechanical and obedient as machines ? In Britain unions have shut down the post office and other services through a job action called " work to rule . " They merely follow the rules as written , and chaos ensues . While management works ceaselessly to restrict human  | judgment and flexibility , it 's also dependent upon them . If any efficiency expert ever perfected a system that repressed these qualities completely , if workers really did just as they were told using no judgment at all , disaster would be immediate . But so far there is no earthly work environment that achieves this management ideal . Even on the most regimented assembly line there 's room for discretion . And workers generally use that discretion to keep things moving along . It takes enormous discipline for human beings to withdraw their cooperation and common sense . It 's amazing how hard it is to carry out the threat , " If they treat me like a machine then I 'll act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was 3 o'clock on a Friday afternoon . As I crossed the lobby , Eddy walked past . I gave him my good-bye pronouncement . " Eddy , I 'm afraid the next step will be to enter all your work directly onto a computer , which will time everything you do and issue all the grant letters and decisions automatically . And if they could get the client to enter his own data , they 'd eliminate you entirely . That 's the direction in other services . " " If it 's strictly mail and machine , " Eddy replied " there 'll be riots and destruction of property . It 's much cheaper to give them the bodies of social workers to abuse . " And he strode off to face his clients . Maybe Eddy is right . Welfare wo n't be as easy to automate as banking because the data ? welfare clients with their babies and burnouts ? is n't as neat to enter into the computer . Ellen Jones had moved up with Jo Martin from welfare mother to clerk to social worker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Services . I stopped by the DSS to thank her for putting me in contact with Jo . " And how is Jo ? " Ellen asked as she guided me to her own office , which was carpeted and air-conditioned . On the way we passed two women discussing a foster girl and her problems in her new school . " I really should go back and visit the old center . " " This is the way they work now , " I said . And I handed her the three page list of Work Measurement Standards . Food stamp change Address change Issue food stamp I.D . card Authorize funeral and burial expenses Replace lost or stolen check : FCB-1 Issue supplementary over-the-counter ATP Issue replacement over-the-counter ATP " Poor Jo , " Ellen said , as I explained that the numbers meant tenths of an hour . " I can remember when we were first asked to get Social Security numbers on the babies . That was the beginning , I guess . " She shook her head as she scanned the list . " But it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ activist ( Service Employees International Union Local 509 represents both the Welfare Department and the Department of Social Services ) pointed out that the pay slide in the Welfare Department had been gradual too . " They did n't get a cut in pay when they became Financial Assistance Workers but they just did n't go up the ladder . So Social Workers and FAWs kind of . . . , " with her hands she showed one moving up , the other sliding down , " separated . But that was gradual too . " Professional futurists have been saying for twenty-five years that office automation will eliminate the drudge work . The  | Office of the Future , they predict , will offer fewer jobs , perhaps , but more skilled ones . Maybe they mean jobs like Ellen 's . Her office deals with foster children , abused children , drug addicts and other special problems . My visit to the Department of Social Services reminded me of one of the frequent patterns in service automation . When a front-line service job , the rank that first meets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's often necessary to create a smaller second rank of better-treated and better-trained workers . These supervisors , ombudsmen or exception workers must be permitted enough discretion to deal with special problems that the lower-level clerks are no longer allowed to handle . When social workers become FAWs , when telephone operators are monitored , when bank tellers literally become machines , there have to be exception workers to cover cases that were n't coded into the pro ram . ( At airline reservation offices special " Flagship " or " Gold Card " phone lines are manned by exception workers , who deal with frequent fliers or travel agents . They 're freer to deviate from the script . ) The Department of Social Services was established to handle special problems when welfare became restricted to the routine distribution of checks . The DSS workers have a quiet , carpeted office , a secretary , higher pay and significantly more nonmonitored time than the FAWs . But there are fewer of them , and they see only extreme cases . So far , computerized service work has necessitated a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Customers are always demanding to speak to a supervisor . Still , for every Ellen in DSS there are dozens of Kevins and Jos about to become computer-aided clerks . Contrary to expert predictions , the majority of jobsare being downgraded . Fewer service workers are free to use human discretion . By now you have to be a special good customer to-see a  | Ellen handed me back the list of sixty-eight functions . " Nobody knew it would end like this . " " I do n't think this is the end , " I said , folding away the contraband document . " Poor Jo . What a different head . " Two weeks later I arranged a telephone interview with Gene DeLucia . DeLucia was head of the systems unit of the Department of Public Welfare and Special Assistant to the Commissioner for Systems . Many of the members of his systems group were on loan to the Department of Welfare from hightech firms that also consult for the Defense Department , where systems analysis was developed . After automating welfare in other states , they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ project called MPACS ? Massachusetts Public Assistance Control System . Though automation had proceeded piecemeal for ten years , it seemed it would finally go all the way under MPACS . DeLucia was the perfect spokesman , then , for " where it 's at and where it 's going in welfare . " And that 's just what I asked him . " Basically I am trying , or rather the systems group is trying , to transfer as much computer power as we possibly can to the end user . The goal is to get as close as possible to a paperless office . " What I envisage is that the client comes in and the Financial Assistance Worker turns to a terminal . If this is a new  | client the machine will prompt the questions to be asked . The Financial Assistance Worker just fills in the answers as stated by the client . At that point the eligibility for all categories of welfare aid from the state of Massachusetts will be automatically determined . Are they eligible for a grant and in what amount ? Are they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stamps and in what amount ? " There will be no turn-around document , because the material goes right into the computer . At that point we can give the client a statement saying , Here are your benefits and this is the information they 're based upon . ' Which he can check right there . " " Could the clients eventually input the information themselves ? " I asked . " I would like nothing better than to see a bank of terminals in the lobby for the clients to do the preliminary input . But that will not happen within the next three years . Our first goal is to make our own workers computer literate . " " What about measuring workers ' productivity ? " I asked . " Will there be a computerized version of the control slips ? " " What we want to do is put the head office in a position to measure the workers ' productivity directly . We want to know how many redeterminations did they do , how many clients did they interview and with what level of accuracy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individual operator . I was n't surprised to hear that the head office would be able to bypass local directors and supervisors and peer directly into the screen of each welfare worker in the state . But I was surprised to hear Mr. DeLucia already referring to the FAWs as " operators " . With computers we should be able to do this for each operator automatically .. " " What will be the standard of productivity ? " I asked . " What I 'd like to do and what I 'll be able to do are not necessarily the same thing . It will depend on the outcome of other factors including union negotiations . But if it were my  | role to plan the terminals , I would want to be able to access , for each operator , how many clients they saw on a daily or hourly basis and with what level of accuracy . " " Would there still be productivity standards or quotas by the tenth of the hour ? " I asked . " No . With the computerized system the goals can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to measure how people are meeting the standards across the state at any given moment . That way I can tell on an ongoing basis if the standards need to be higher or lower . " ( " Trap all the information ... across the state at any given moment . " I began to understand the allure of omnipotence . ) DeLucia explained the priority that guided the MPACS project and the similar PACS studies in other states . " The federal government has funded these studies to achieve a certain level of consistency . That means that if there are sixty local offices in a state they want to know that there will be consistency in the application of the welfare guidelines . In addition , the government wants more management information available . But consistency is the main thing . " " Does that mean , " I asked , trying not to sound hostile , " that there will be significantly less discretion for the welfare workers ? " I thought I was asking a negative question and feared that it might prompt a defensive answer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the concept of workers ' discretion that he wheeled around to defend the opposite flank . " There will definitely be much less discretion , " he assured me stoutly . " However , " he admitted , " if the worker is so inclined he can still shade the information going into the computer . " This was said as an admission that no system is perfect . Like many consultants who apply the systems method , Gene Delucia has a tendency to speak abstractly . This is natural , since the theory of systems analysis asserts that the method  | is equally applicable to almost any endeavor from moving troops , to match-making , to disposing of garbage . ' Though he seemed remote from the daily workings of a welfare center , DeLucia gave me a well-stated summary of what I know to be state-of-the-art thinking among systems analysts automating public service . From his description , it seems that social workers will wind up half-way between receptionists and airline reservation agents . Welfare was in one way a fortunate service profession to study at this time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ automation dangling for almost ten years . That meant that without any trick photography we were able to watch , in slow motion , a process that normally goes too fast to see . In order to automate any job , white-collar or industrial , all its functions have to be broken out . When Henry Ford designed his automobile assembly line , he had to make sure he included every step from weld motor to attach running board . He could n't afford to say afterwards , " Oh , we forgot the door handles . " Similarly , welfare automaters have to include every operation from add baby to issue funeral allowance . But normally with computer automation , there 'd be no extended period of keeping track of every function on paper . The decade of control slips and constantly amended time standards at the Welfare Department is obviously absurd . Add a baby , .3 ; issue burial expenses , .7 . It looks like a parody of the systems approach to human services . In most cases , from the appearance of the first clipboard men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's little time to do much more than worry about who 'll keep their jobs .  | When a skilled job is routinized , some people move up to become supervisors or exception workers . The rest are usually fired , transferred or disappear through a process of accelerated attrition . It 's hard , then , to show through interviews that a professional job has been downgraded , because the professional is usually gone . There 's " a hole in the floor , " a phrase I first heard at an insurance company where it was used to describe the void created by eliminating a position as opposed to just laying off a person . The person now doing the major part of the job may have started as a clerk . And the new clerical job may be an upgraded position . Even now , while the welfare system is still in transition , FAWs no longer need college degrees and they 're paid less than social workers . Because Welfare has been automating piecemeal and because it 's a civil service job , more employees stay on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some individuals move down steadily , step by step , from autonomous professionals to skilled clerks . I left Boston wondering which of the social workers I met at NTW would still be there when they finally reached the level DeLucia referred to as " operators . " Fourteen months later , most people at NTW had at least heard the acronym MPACS . A gaggle of social workers were gathered in the hallway the day I dropped in again . " That MPACS thing , it 's definitely going through . " " Nah , they called it off again . " " Look , there 's no way they can start it up till ... " " It 's rescheduled for February , " Daniel Sheridan cut through the confusion . " They 're asking for volunteers . " Daniel passed around a letter requesting six supervisors to staff a model MPACS unit . A suburban welfare office had been selected for the test site .  | " So it 's not till February . " " Way out there ? " " Volunteers , huh ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't want a typical unit . They want to pick all antiunion people . " " No , I think it just means ... " No one was sure what it meant except Eddy Malloy , the FAW who loved computers . " Everything we do is gon na be done from our desks now , " Eddy began one of his frenetic monologues . " They give you an I.D . number . When you turn it on in the morning , you 're on . When you turn it off in the evening , you 're gone . It 's a total control system . Look , I 've got ... " The FAWs dispersed , unable to absorb Eddy 's Cassandralike vision . In the months since my last visit , Eddy had changed more than anything else at NTW . He was still a somewhat awkward youth but he 'd grown his hair long , moved into his own apartment and become the union 's official automation expert . " I 've got copies of the proposed screens . " We were in his office now and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Got myself a slot on the committee : I 'm in with this guy who 's writing the GSD General Sytems Design . This company that got the contract to computerize us shoving more papers at me , they 've already done Georgia , they 're in the process of doing New Mexico . Twenty-three states are already ... " " What about the monitoring programs ? " I asked . " That 's what they wo n't tell us . There 's a state Right-toKnow law . I think I could force them to disclose ... " Eddy 's phone rang . " Belmont ? " he hopped over to his old one-way terminal and scanned the screen . " Yes , Lavone Belmont is active in that she has two children , Cherisa and Shawn .... Right . "  | " A hospital , " Eddy explained when he got off the phone , " for the medical billing . Previously I would have had to find the T.D. , then check the master file down the hall , which comes out once a month . With the computer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open . It 's still a terrific tool . " " So why does n't the union say , O.K. , we 'll take the computers but without the monitoring programs ? " I asked . " No Monitoring . Before they get you on line , before you become so tied to the machine that you ca n't even ... As soon as I suggested a confrontation on electronic monitoring Eddy did an understandable about face and began explaining why there was n't any rush . " The better people will train the others at first . While it 's still training there 'll still be some physical freedom . " " O.K. , so you personally will be able to walk around for the first few months , " I conceded . " But you just told me yourself , it 's a total control system . Once they switch you on ... " " It 's not gon na go in for at least a year and a half . They 'd never put it in before an election year . Anyway , a third of these welfare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reassuring himself " They 'll have to Mickey Mouse it around to fit in all their computers . Too many terminals generate too much heat in these tiny old rooms . I got the health and safety regulations here . . . We 're gon na fight them every step on ... " " So you 're gon na fight them on how many terminals they can put in each room ? " I shook my head . " You 're gon na nitpick , slow ' em down . That 's the whole plan ? " " Listen , " Eddy told me conspiratorially . " I can bring down this machine , and every machine in the building due to a hardware flaw . The Welfare Department is so incompetent , they gave the contract to a company that sells a machine that I can crash just by . . . " " By everybody pressing the same button at the same time , " I cut him off .  | " All it takes is two people , " he protested . " Oh , Eddy , do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you love the computer . It 's a wonderful tool . " " Yeah , but once they put in the monitoring we 're done , we 're gone , we 're EDP operators . " We 'd come full circle . I continued educating poor Eddy : " The welfare workers in Sweden said they would n't use computers unless all the time they saved on paperwork was used to do real social work . " Eddy was pacing fast and shaking his head , but I continued . " The Canadian Postal Workers Union got an actual clause in their contract that says no monitoring on groups less than ten . The Blue Cross/Blue Shield workers in California are asking for . . . " There were pitifully few examples I could cite . " We 'd lose the point if we said no individual monitoring , " he insisted . " Call it a matter of health and safety , " I kept at it . " Monitored clerical workers have the highest rate of stress diseases : heart attacks , high blood pressure , muscle strain . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fists against his thighs . " Or call it privacy , " I would n't stop . " Several unions in Europe have been able to ... " Eddy 's despair turned to anger . " The system is called MPACS , " he hissed at me . " Massachusetts Public Assistance Control System . Control ' is the operative adjective . How can I tell them to take out the control ? Control is what the system is about ! " All the way home I felt bad about asking twenty-eight-yearold Eddy Malloy to raise a quixotic banner against the entire second industrial revolution . He was right . Control is what the system is about . He 'd be asking management to give up the most powerful control tool ever invented . The state Welfare Department , supported by federal grants ,  | had brought in a high-powered team of systems analysts . Their techniques had been perfected at Lockheed , the RAND Corporation , Aerojet-General and so on , with limitless Pentagon funds . Who did Eddy have on his side ? Ironically , Eddy was the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look at the proposed screens . How could he convey the numbing detail of the electronic sweatshop to Debby , Kenny , Jo and the others ? For the last ten years , welfare had been evolving from a social work profession to a clerical job . This was policy with or without computers . The bureaucratic blizzard in which every paper generated another piece of paper was distressing to all the welfare workers . But it had led the conscientious workers to believe that they 'd always be able to get around the system ; they 'd always be able to pinch time from the paperwork to do their social work . Even now , as the federal government looms over them with MPACS , the social workers at NTW still ca n't imagine that they will ever sit at a terminal dispensing welfare the way other workers dole out phone reservations or Big Macs .  | By now you have some idea why you ca n't expect flexible conversation from a fast-food counterman or an airline reservation agent . If you want individual attention you 'll have to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human contact is minimized when customer service is automated . But even before automation , these were n't essentially relationship jobs . Conversation was necessary , of course , in order for the waiter or the reservation clerk to find out what you wanted and to transmit your order . But human contact was only a by-product of these services , not the product itself . It 's not as if McDonald 's has automated love , motherhood or psychotherapy . Nor did the Welfare Department truly automate social work . No one in the Massachusetts Welfare Department would claim that today 's welfare clerk provides the same kind of human services as the old-fashioned social worker . She 's not supposed to . When the department changed the title of its  | front-line employee from Social Worker to Financial Assistance Worker , it had decided to get rid of whatever was left of the diagnosing , counseling and comforting functions . In this sense the social work has n't been automated , it 's been eliminated . But outside of welfare , more ambitious planners are determined to automate human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ programs that can " listen " to your problems , " mull over " possibilities and deliver the kind of advice you 'd expect from a personal counselor . These programs are in the category called " expert systems . " They 're the first commercial products of the field of computer science called " artificial intelligence . " Interestingly , the first and still most famous computerized counselor was designed by a man who had no intention of replacing human beings . In his book Computer Power and Human Reason ' this unusual computer scientist pleaded with his colleagues to understand that human intelligence was almost divinely different from anything they could simulate . Yet he inadvertently created the computer therapist that inspired a generation of automaters to believe that they could replace human sympathy with something cheaper . In 1966 Joseph Weizenbaum of MIT demonstrated a language-processing program that could play ( or in Weizenbaum 's word , " parody " ) the role of a Rogerian therapist . " The Rogerian therapist is relatively easy to imitate , " Weizenbaum explained , " because much of his technique @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's statements back to him . " Weizenbaum named the program ELIZA , after Eliza Doo- little , because , in a very limited sense , he would be teaching it to talk . To test the program , he invited students and staff at MIT to type patientlike statements into the computer . ELIZA answered in print . Here 's an example of a conversation generated between a young woman ( roman type ) and ELIZA ( italics ) . Men are all alike . In what way They 're always bugging us about something or other . Can you think of a specific example Well , my boyfriend made me come here . Your boyfriend made you come here He says I 'm depressed much of the time . I am sorry to hear you are depressed It 's true , I am unhappy . Do you think coming here will help you not to be unhappy I need some help . That much seems certain . What would it mean if you could get some help Perhaps I could learn to get along with my mother . Tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . Who else in your family takes care of you My father . Your father You are like my father in some ways . What resemblance do you see You are not very aggressive but I think you do n't want me to notice that . What makes you think I am not very aggressive You do n't argue with me . Why do you think I do n't argue with you You are afraid of me . Does it please you to believe I am afraid of you My father is afraid of everybody .  | What else comes to your mind when you think of your father Bullies . Does that have anything to do with the fact that your boyfriend made you come here ELIZA was the ancestor of today 's expert systems . It supplied its responses by using the vocabulary and syntax rules Weizenbaum provided . But , as Joseph Weizenbaum passionately insisted , ELIZA neither converses , analyzes nor understands human feelings . It merely juggles words . Because he understood these limitations , Weizenbaum was amazed by the way people responded to ELIZA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked him to leave the room so they could carry on their session in private . More disturbing was the response from professionals . Carl Sagan , the astrophysicist , wrote : ... I can imagine the development of a network of computer psychotherapeutic terminals , something like arrays of large telephone booths , in which , for a few dollars a session , we would be able to talk with an attentive , tested , and largely nondirective psychotherapist . In an article in The Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease , 3 ELIZA was hailed by therapists as " a therapeutic tool which can be made widely available to mental hospitals and psychiatric centers . " The same article suggested that " several hundred patients an hour could be handled by a computer system designed for this purpose , " and it explained that a real therapist is n't much more than a sophisticated program any-way : A human therapist can be viewed as an information processor and decision maker . . . . He is guided in these decisions by rough empirical rules telling him what is appropriate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | To Joseph Weizenbaum , ELIZA 's programmer , psychiatry was one human being helping another . " What can the psychiatrist 's image of his patient be , " Weizenbaum asked , " when he sees himself not as an engaged human being acting as a healer , but as an information processor following rules ? " The most disturbing response that Weizenbaum dealt with was among his colleagues . Computer scientists hailed ELIZA as an example of artificial intelligence . To Weizenbaum it was clear that his computer " understood " only in the weakest possible sense . It could follow grammatical rules . But it could n't understand what people felt or meant . It could never understand , for instance , " just what kind of emotional impact touching another person 's hand will have both on the other person and on himself . . . . The knowledge involved is in part kinesthetic , its acquisition involves having a hand , to say the very least . There are , in other words , " wrote Weizenbaum , " somethings humans know by virtue of having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intelligence expanded at MIT and most other universities , Weizenbaum , a seminal computer scientist , became more and more isolated by his insistence that computers could never exhibit human intelligence . In the twenty years since Joseph Weizenbaum first showed his little ELIZA around MIT , research in expert systems has been funded primarily by the military . The military developed . automatic pilots and expert command stems for sea and air battles . ( See Chapter 10 , " Command and Control , " for more on military expert systems . ) Slowly , expert systems began to be used in the civilian world . They appeared first in industrial settings , where they replicated scarce expertise in fields like oil-well drilling and  | telephone-line maintenance . Then they began to be consulted for medical diagnosis . Now they 're creeping up into the less precise areas of social , psychological and financial expertise . Periodically interest was aroused anew in the idea of a computer therapist , but no one followed through with a commercial ELIZA . Maybe there was no market . People who can afford psychiatry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therapy was still too expensive ; costly machines were needed for expert systems . But in the past twenty years computer hardward has steadily improved so that expert systems similar in principle to ELIZA are now much easier to program and can be run on small computers . What 's most distinctive about expert systems is not the computer hardware or even the programming , but the class of workers ? doctors , lawyers and military commanders ? whose decision making these systems are designed to replicate . The intention behind these systems ? to transfer knowledge , skill and decision making from the employee to the employer ? is certainly not a new management goal . In fact , the way expert systems are created sounds exactly like the turn-of-the-century time-and-motion studies conducted by men like Frederick Taylor and Frank Gilbreth . As I listened to the enthusiastic " knowledge engineers " who build expert systems , I could n't help imagining them in derby hats with stop watches in their vest pockets . The much-hated stop-watch men stood right behind the laborer and broke his job down into its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand up . The modern knowledge engineer performs similar detailed studies , only he anatomizes decision making rather than bricklaying . So the time-and-motion study has become a time-and-thought study . The most novel thing about building an expert system is the sciencefiction-sounding vocabulary used to describe the process . To build an expert system , a living expert is debriefed and  | then cloned by a knowledge engineer . That is to say , an expert is interviewed , typically for weeks or months . The knowledge engineer watches the expert work on sample problems and asks exactly what factors the expert considered in making his apparently intuitive decisions . Eventually hundreds or thousands of rules of thumb are fed into the computer . The result is a program that can " make decisions " or " draw conclusions " heuristically instead of merely calculating with equations . Like a real expert , a sophisticated expert system should be able to draw inferences from " iffy " or incomplete data that seems to suggest or tends to rule out . In other words it uses ( or replaces ) judgment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctors , lawyers and military commanders ? Do n't they use intuition as well as rules ? Do n't they have to look at each case ? It 's tempting to say that expert systems just wo n't work . But skilled bakers , tailors and blacksmiths also laughed at the idea of automating jobs that required so much experience and judgment . Perhaps it would be better to ask whether it will work after we 've looked at some expert systems more closely . It 's both tricky and tedious to try to capture all of an expert 's expertise . I got a sense of this neo ? stop-watch procedure when I talked to an estate planning expert who had been cloned into a financial planning expert system . Natalie Choate is the world 's first successfully cloned estate planner . Miss Choate , a Harvard Law School graduate ( 1970 ) , is the partner in charge of pension and estate planning at a prestigious Boston law firm . Over the course of a year , including four months of intensive sessions three or four times a week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to PlanPower , a financial planning expert system  | developed by Applied Expert Systems Inc . ( APEX ) with the backing of The Travelers Insurance Company . Other experts were debriefed in tax planning , investment planning , and related fields . PlanPower was the first white-collar expert system I 'd heard of that was available on the open market ? cost : $70,000 . Until then most office expert systems had been developed by corporations or other institutions for their own internal use . " Did you enjoy being cloned ? " I asked Miss Choate in her office . " It was great fun . . . gave me a chance to think about what I really do in my practice . . . . The most difficult thing to capture was the things that were intuitive for me . The judgments you make when you look at the client and start to talk . " " For instance ? " I asked " For instance , I would say to Bruce , Bruce Henderson , APEX executive and knowledge engineer that I would never recommend a particular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would say , How young is a young couple ? ' I 'd say . Well , in their twenties . ' " In order to convey the difficulty of transforming intuitive judgments into rules , Natalie brought out her notes and recreated some of the debriefing conversations that went on between her and Bruce , for hours , days and months . Bruce : You mean the husband is in his twenties or the wife is in her twenties ? Natalie : I guess the husband is in his twenties . Bruce : So we should make a rule , if the husband is thirty years of age or over we recommend this trust . If the husband is twenty-nine years of age or younger we recommend the other trust .  | " Hearing it that way I 'd say , Well he may be thirty-one and be too young or he may be twenty-nine and old enough . ' " Eventually Bruce 's questions made me realize that my judgment was n't based just on age . Wealth might be a factor . So we 'd pare it down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wealth . But of course the first client who walked into the office might be the exception to that rule . " Or there would be a case where we would say , this estate plan is for someone with assets of $750,000 or more . But again the first person to walk into the office with $749,000 might be a good customer . And a person with $800,000 might be wrong because you think it 's going to shrink , not grow . So you have to account for that intuitive feeling with rules for determining if this is a shrinking or growing situation . We 'd be hours and hours working out all the possibilities till we came up with a rule that was good : a rule that encompassed what I actually did in practice ... . " I remember once , a month later , I looked at a rule we had developed and it did n't make any sense to me . So I said let 's change it . But we checked it out and found that it was surprising but right . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' means it maximized the estate . " I asked Miss Choate if she would use the expert system in her own office . " In my own practice ? No . I might use it as a check for my own consistency . If I came up with something different from the system I 'd check again to make sure I was at my best that day . But in the case of a real difference . . . " Natalie gestured dismissively , confident that she was the real expert . " How do you feel now that the first few PlanPowers are being shipped out ? " I asked . " Right this minute someone in another state may be unpacking or consulting you . " " I love it , it gives me a feeling of . . . You see , as an estate  | lawyer in a private practice , I draw up X dozen wills a year or X number of plans . But with the APEX project I feel I will do millions of estate trusts . It gives me a feeling of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm told , experts , who get upset by the thought that they could be replaced by a system . But the way I feel , if it ever gets to the point where it 's as good as I am ? let it . I 'll go do something else . " Expert systems do n't usually replace the expert who 's been cloned . Like Natalie Choate , he or she was selected because he 's among the leaders in his field . He 'll probably go on to acquire new expertise . The program is created to capture some of his knowledge , experience and judgment so that it can be used by other workers who wo n't ever have to acquire the same level of expertise . In a sense , it 's future experts who are being displaced since fewer Natalie Choates will be needed . As Bruce Henderson , Miss Choate 's personal knowledge engineer , explained : " You and I are not financial planners but with this system we could be . You see , half the job is customer relations ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relationship person salesman , broker or whoever deals with the customer can sit down and do what-ifs ' with a mouse . Talk to it like it 's a financial planning assistant . . . . Another scenario , the relationship person can take down the data and there 's a back office where a low-level staff person can do the work of running the plan . The system saves a great deal of training or retraining and brings some very advanced thinking to everyone . " If the financial planning expert system works according to Bruce Henderson 's second scenario , a salesman/clerk ( " relationship person " ) can take down information from the client . A data-input clerk ( " low-level staff person " ) can run the pro- gram in the back office . The APEX system will automatically print out a sixty- to eighty-page personal financial plan in good English with specific advice like : " The summer home could be remortgaged to finance . . . " or " John 's IRA should be invested in .... " Natalie Choate 's estate planning expertise can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to learn planning themselves . What if I could learn geometry or a foreign language , then take the disk out of my brain and drop it into your brain ? I wonder why humans do n't have slots in their heads for disks . As it stands now , each of us learns everything the slow , painful way : Little children practice hours a day for years before they can speak their native tongue . Why are we such inefficient learning machines ? In order to learn , each human being goes through an active process that makes the material his own . Each person who learns a language changes it . When my daughter was a year and a half old , I would bend over her and say , " Here 's your orange juice . " And she would repeat " Orange juice . " Or I would say , " Here 's you 're apple juice . " And she would say " Appoo juice . " ( I unconsciously mouthed the words with her , " appoo juice , " " orange juice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her soul . ) Then one day I said , " Juliet , here 's your orange juice , " and she said , " No , I want appoo juice ! " Where had that sentence come from ? She 'd never heard anyone say " No , I want apple juice . " It was marvelous . It was frightening . ( It was also the beginning of the terrible twos . ) I had created something that was not my creation . My own daughter would go on to say the most extraordinary things ever uttered in the English language . Long after I die , she 'll be saying things I never could  | dream of . What greater gratification could there be for a par-ent ? But most employers are n't looking for that kind of gratification . They 'd just as soon the salesman go on saying " apple juice " as long as that 's the company 's line and switch to " orange juice " when company policy changes . Active learning leads to constant modification . Everyone who learns how to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many new and unpredictable things . But expert systems , like almost all the other management systems we 've looked at , will discourage change and diversity . Like the programming at McDonald 's or American Airlines , the standard application of expert systems assumes that there is a best way . It also assumes that that best way is best determined by those in charge . An expert system can be updated , of course . With a sophisticated program like PlanPower , it 's easy to add new products , new prices , new tax rules . But the majority of people who use the program will never be qualified to reprogram it . It 's no longer essential that they learn in the normal human sense . When the company changes its line , a new disk can be dropped into their slots . Instead of a continuous and evolutionary process , change becomes periodic abrupt and topdown . If expert systems worked ideally , there would soon be fewer experts left on earth who could actually exercise and modify important skills . Maybe that does n't matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care if there are only six estate planners in the world . I do n't even care if they 're all wrong . ) But it has mattered over the centuries that not hundreds but hundreds of millions of people have contributed to the evolution of our sciences , languages , arts and crafts . Every human being who learned how to speak has contributed to the way our languages are now spoken . Everyone who ever hummed a tune has changed musical history .  | It 's dangerous to confine our species ' expertise to a few . Especially to the few who grab for it . But this is a philosophical issue . Office expert systems do n't work that well yet . PlanPower , as I mentioned , was one of the first white-collar expert systems on the market . Its MIT entrepreneurial promoters were pleased to tell a reporter how it was supposed to work . But there was no way I could see it in operation . So instead I looked at financial planning expert systems developed in-house at Merrill Lynch and Shearson Lehman Brothers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comprehensive expert systems than PlanPower . Which certainly does n't mean that they 're less sophisticated companies . Indeed , there 's no better way to find out how the technology will actually be used in the financial industry than to look at the two innovative giants , Shearson Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch .  | " There was a time , " a retired stockbroker said nostalgically , " when the brokers at your large wire houses were like independent professionals doing business under the Lehman Brothers or Paine Webber umbrella . But by the time I retired , you were more like an employee . The customer belonged to the firm . " Their traditional independence may be declining , but it 's still common for stockbrokers to change firms every few years , taking their big customers with them . Quite naturally , brokerage management does n't like to lose customers , nor does it enjoy bargaining over commissions with employees who can simply walk away with the clients . A major goal of brokerage management is to bind clients to the firm rather than to the individual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to become the client 's trusted personal advisor . It seemed logical that the ongoing battle for client loyalty  | would somehow be epxressed in brokerage computing . Yet I could n't imagine how any technology could daunt the freewheeling Wall Street broker . The financial industry was in a small whirl in 1986 when I happened to look . Perhaps it always is . From a distance there seemed to be only one kind of movement during the long bull market of the 1980s , represented by a solid , black line streaking up . But when I came closer I noticed the small whirls and spirals . The particular whirl of 1986 , accelerated by deregulation and tax-deferred retirement accounts ( IRAs and Keoghs ) , was rapidly transforming banks , insurance companies and brokerage houses into competing financial supermarkets . All three types of financial institutions were now advertising insurance , stocks , bonds , mutual funds , tax shelters , retirement plans and so on . To tie their many products together , Merrill Lynch had invented the CMA ( Cash Management Account ) . Formerly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or commissions on securities transactions . But now , like banks , they make a great deal of money by using or lending clients ' money . But first they had to get hold of it . That 's called " asset gathering . " At seemingly the same moment , many financial institutions realized that one way to attract a customer 's total assets was to offer a total financial plan . To that end the brokers at Merrill Lynch , Shearson Lehman Brothers , Prudential-Bache , and other large houses were to become financial planners . The " personalized " plans they offered would suggest ways in which all the client 's assets could be gathered into the firm 's many new products and accounts . But stockbrokers do n't make commissions on consulting or asset gathering . They 've traditionally made their money buying and selling stocks and bonds . That 's what they 're paid for and that 's what they know how to do .  | To promote the new approach , both Shearson and Merrill Lynch changed the title of their basic broker to Financial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name ? How do you change a broker into a consultant ? How can the old-fashioned broker ( or " stock jockey , " as I heard him derisively described by brokerage executives ) suddenly become an experienced consultant on everything from college planning and estate planning to insurance and real estate ? How can an organization like Merrill Lynch , with over 10,000 brokers , see that their new Financial Consultants practice the art with some uniformity ? ( After all , the firm can be sued if its advisors give wildly unprofessional advice . ) And how can the brokerage bind the new financial planning customers to the firm instead of to the individual consultant ? Expert systems held the promise of a mechanical answer to these questions . Both Shearson and Merrill Lynch had developed computerized Financial Planners . Shearson 's PRO ( Personal Review Outline ) was intended to be given free to every customer . Merrill 's PathFinder was a more elaborate report designed to be sold for $250 . But the first problem was n't selling the public , it was selling the salesmen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ product and his difficulties getting brokers to use it . " Here 's the PRO . " Kevin Bernstein showed me a four page questionnaire that asked about assets , dependents and attitudes toward risk . " Just a few questions , would you like to fill it in ? ' That 's what the broker says . Then we keypunch it ? no one reads it ? and it produces this document . " He showed me a sample plan , a well-written , twelve-page report . Kevin had no doubt that the PRO was a terrific product . His problem was promoting it internally . " We do a roll-out for our sales force , division by division .  | In each area we rent a hotel room , do a road show . We show them how it will help them leverage their time , help increase their commissions , but we ca n't send out orders . " Wait , let me tell you how it starts , let me back up . First a company like Shearson goes out and decides what business they 're in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be in the financial service business . And we want to convey our goods through people we call Financial Consultants . ( I hope you 'll note that Merrill started calling them Financial Consultants after Shearson . ) .. . " Now many of our brokers were always doing some kind of financial consulting . But a lot of them are still back there in the dinosaur age : buy the stock , make the commission , sell the stock , make the commission . Dialing for dollars I call it . They get on the phone , If I could double your money in two years would you invest $10,000 ? ' If he says yes , you say What about $20,000 dollars ? ' " But that way all you get is his play money , the $20,000 he can afford to lose . But what about the $200,000 he 's got in C.D.s and the money market ? As his Financial Consultant , you 'd be playing with a bigger pool so you do n't have to make a commission on every transaction ... . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . " I drew up the questionnaire first , very short , very simple . I threw it on the table and I said , This is your mother . She says " Kevin , I sent you to college , you got an MBA , now tell me what should I do with my money , and do n't use any big words and do n't give me a million options . " ' " That 's the discipline I enforced on my staff : confine yourself to the information you can get off this form , write the letter you 'd write to your own mother . . . . " The important thing about a PRO is that it does n't tell the broker exactly what to sell , but it makes the client familiar with our products . And , maybe more important , it gets some of the newer products out on the table for the broker to look  | at too . So it 's educational for the broker , but it does n't replace him . " This is not a stand alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I rolled it out at these road shows I said to these brokers , If I 'm smart enough to build a piece of software to make you obsolete , I 'm smart enough not to try it . Because there are 5000 of you and you have the customers . ' " So the PRO is not designed to come up with the right answer or to be the salesperson . . . . Shearson ca n't put an ad in The New York Times : Fill out this form ; we 'll mail you a complete financial plan . ' No , we send the plan back to the broker . He 's the first person who reads it . We tell the broker to customize it . Take a red pencil and circle things . Say , In your case there might be a better product than a real estate trust . ' You say to them , This is good general advice but the computer did n't meet you . I did . ' " Remember , " Kevin philosophized , " there 's an old saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they know how much you care . ' And I 'll add to that , You ca n't tell them you care , you 've got to show them . ' So before you send it out mark it up , show you spent time . Say , I thought about you because I know you . ' " This shows the investor that this guy is not just a stock jockey . He gets to see that our brokers are doing business the Shearson way , as Financial Consultants . Also , the PRO gets the right questions on the table ... . " One of the things I do at those roll-outs , I offer a $25 bonus to each broker who sends in ten PROs by the end of the month . It amazes me what a salesman will do for $25 . ( Well , that 's why they 're salesman , I guess . They 're competitive . ) " But I ca n't order them to use the PRO . . . . My problem is not that PRO will be good or bad but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few tools for brokers that sit there on the shelf .  | That 's the worst thing that can happen to a system ; it is n't used . " I did n't meet anyone at Merrill Lynch who expressed Kevin 's doubts about getting the brokers to adopt the new approach . At Merrill Lynch Advanced Office Systems , ML/AOS a senior executive invited a junior systems man to sit in while he explained a range of computerized aids for brokers . " Some of these systems can be categorized as information systems rather than expert systems . . . . For instance , a system that shows me all my clients who make over $50,000 , shows me all my clients who hold IBM , shows me all my clients who have expressed an interest in IBM ? they give you the ability to access and manipulate information ... . " One of the things that we at ML/AOS have to worry about is information overload . The F.C . gets on his desk each morning enough information to paper his room . So we do information retrieval systems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ file things ; what 's your daily routine ? If you look at enough individuals you begin to see patterns . And it 's the patterns we 're automating , not the exceptions . " The junior man , who had n't spoken much , said , " We like to watch what the good brokers do . Oops , I keep saying brokers . ' " " You actually go out and watch the brokers work ? " I asked . " We watch like a bug on the wall . " " Like a time-and-motion study ? " " Well , no , that 's an industrial phrase , " the junior man explained . " Just if a guy 's good , if he 's got a new angle you go see if it 's something unique to him or something you can make a uniform Merrill product . " I asked if some salesmen were n't reluctant to pass along information .  | " What we 're finding , " explained the senior systems man , " is that in order to get a sales individual to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terminal he 's got to see some benefits from it . You have to bring them into the process . The goal is to in-gather information about the client and his assets . Now that brings us to financial planning . " He explained PathFinder and the new expert systems CollegeBuilder and HomeBuilder . All three would enable the broker to provide a uniform style of financial consulting and thereby become more effective at asset gathering . Before I left , I asked the same question I 'd asked Kevin at Shearson , " Are salesmen worried about using new products or sending in too much information because they do n't want their clients to become the company 's clients ? " Kevin had answered , " Sure , but I do n't know if they have a choice . . . . The business is changing . " At Merrill , the senior systems man replied , " Some brokers may be paranoid . Of course , the company does have an interest in holding on to their clients , but a company ca n't be paranoid . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brokers holding back information . " If they do n't want to input their client 's data , then they do n't have to use our cross posting or CollegeBuilder or any of the other systems that save them .... " They reminded me before I left that PathFinder was rated highest among the computerized Financial Planners . They never expressed Kevin 's anxieties about getting the brokers to use it . In fact , though , it was very difficult to find any broker at Shearson or Merrill using either expert system .  | " I have an appointment with Miss Farrell , " I said . Heidi Farrell had left Merrill Lynch and moved on to another large , prestigious brokerage firm . I waited near the receptionist 's desk , expecting to hear the staccato heels of a dressed-for-success woman . Instead , I was greeted by a young girl in a long , dark skirt and high necked , ruffled blouse . Her hair was pinned back like Alice in Wonderland . Heidi was the perfect mix of efficiency and concern as she took my coat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of tea . The Quotron on her desk ? the standard broker 's terminal ? swiveled to serve the young man in the adjoining cubby . " Why did you leave Merrill Lynch ? " I asked " At Merrill it was all rules and forms . Every situation fit into one of their procedures . But to me everything in this business is idiosyncratic . Besides , I felt that many of the forms were to the disadvantage of the clients and the brokers . Here , at her new firm you fill out the name , address , Social Security number . " " But do n't you need a certain amount of personal information to do financial planning for your clients ? " I asked . " As a matter of fact , me and my partner , " she pointed to a young man a few desks away , " are developing our own program to do financial planning . Let 's face it , it takes a long time to do all that math by hand . But our program will have nothing to do with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " At Merrill the point of financial planning was to collect all the client 's information and then sell him Merrill products . You learned how to tie the client into a knot , a knot where the client belonged to the company . "  | " I guess you never used PathFinder then ? " I asked . " Actually , PathFinder was pretty good for the $250 . And you 're not obliged to use Merrill products . But no , I never used it . " " Do you know any broker who did ? " She could n't remember any . " But I did use the CMA Cash Management Account account . It seemed like a useful account the CMA included a credit card and automatically swept interest or any other loose cash into a money market fund until I had to transfer a few of my clients out of CMAs . Then I saw why the older brokers kept everything in stocks and bonds . " The phone rang . " I 'm sorry to hear that , " Heidi said , sounding professional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the movies . O.K. , I 'll be here till 9 . " " My sister , " she explained . " She has no heat . She lives way over in a tenement on West Street . Well , you get what you pay for . " Heidi lives on the East Side , within walking distance of the office . " Was there any pressure on you to open CMA accounts ? " I asked . " Oh yes . In fact there was this big broker at Merrill . He was about sixty , an incredible salesperson . No , it goes beyond that . A great professional . She paused for a moment to honor him . At sales meetings they would discuss the advantages of CMAs . How you can gather all the client 's assets , how eventally you will end up with more commissions . But this big broker never used CMAs . He had everything in cash , everything in ready assets . And they would be on him in meetings . Come on , Joe , make those CMAs ! ' " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't want him to leave and take his clients with him . But I was one of the smaller people . I 'd write up CMAs all the time . And really , " she admitted , " I felt then that they were for my own benefit .  | I respected salesmen like Joe but I also thought ? well , you see , the company put down the older people , somewhat for resisting change ? so I thought , well , CMAs were n't in existence when he started . He does n't want to call up all his clients ? he had thousands of clients ? and tell them all to come on in and sign these papers , fill out all these forms . That may have been one reason . But the other reason was , with straight stocks and bonds he could pick up his book at any time and leave . " CMAs made my paperwork a lot simpler while I was there , but when I moved , to get those goddamn accounts out of there , it was murder . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The only people who came with me , they had to really like me personally . People who came with me had to deal with all that paperwork and back-and-forths . " Poor Sally , " I said . My friend Sally , a novelist , was Heidi 's client . " She did n't feel the worst of it , " Heidi assured me . " They tried the hardest to hold the ones that had real money . Well , that 's the game . Heidi softened toward her former employer . The more liquid assets you control , the better the game player you are . After all , the goal of the money game is money . " " What is your goal ? " I asked . " Would you like to be an independent broker some day ? " " Oh definitely ! In the meantime I 'm building my client base . Most of the people in my book have made money in real estate . Now they 've sold their houses and they 're looking for an investment that 's as safe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trader . The traders live in front of their Quotrons . You burn out . I specialize in real estate . My clients are speculators too , but in the long term . I have a small real estate investment myself so I understand the situations my clients face . " " How old are you ? " I asked . I was beginning to be impressed or perhaps dismayed by this little girl in barrettes who  | invested in real estate , lived on the Upper East Side and planned to build her book of loyal clients and then walk out with them . " Twenty-eight , " she answered . Heidi had graduated from a respectable college . Her older sister , the one without heat , had dropped or drifted out of a more prestigious college . " She 's on the ten-year plan , you might say . My sister is the creative one , " said Heidi . " But what good is creativity if you do n't sit down and actually create something ? " Heidi summarized her philosophy as a broker . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my firm , in that order . If my clients make money , I 'll make money myself in the long run . " She began organizing her lists for the evening 's cold calling . " It does n't bother you to call strangers and ask them to invest ? " " What 's the worst thing that can happen ? " she asked . " If they hang up , are you worse off than you were before you called ? " " I guess that 's true , " I answered . " But I always imagine how busy people are . I was even afraid to call you . " " I 'll try to find you someone who used PathFinder , " she promised and she added a note to her " to do " pile . I phoned Len Deusenberg , a Senior Vice President at a prestigious brokerage house , to ask if it was really so difficult to transfer clients out of Merrill and Shearson brokerage accounts . " Let me tell you about my own personal IRA , " the broker volunteered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " When  | I moved from Shearson , my own IRA dropped from $20,000 down to $13,000 and I could n't get my hands on it , could n't do a transaction . Four months without a trade ! Me ! I 'm an aggressive trader . And I could n't do a thing about it . " Think how upsetting that would be to a client . I 'm supposed to be serving the customer and I ca n't even find out what 's in his account . " In his eight years " on the street " Len had worked at five different brokerage houses . He 's a Senior V.P. at his present firm by virtue of the fact that he brings in over $750,000 a year in commissions . The average broker does about $150,000 a year . " The biggest producers , " Len assured me , " are the brokers who specialize ? stocks , bonds , options . Not the financial planning guy . But the firms may not care about that anymore . They may be happier with a large number of average @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and keep the customers . " Right now , the industry is trying very hard to make the broker less powerful over the customer 's bottom line . As they come to have more control they can give the broker a smaller percent . Typically , the highest you can get at a major house now is 45 percent . They may add a bonus , contests , profit sharing . You might be able to cut a deal for 50 at one of the majors . But 35 is typical . " But the thing I find incredible , " Len slowed down for emphasis , " Merrill has started a system of salaried brokers for small accounts . Noncommissioned brokers ! That 's an affront to people like me . " Dan Donahue , the manager of Merrill Lynch 's Fifth Avenue office , with 250 brokers , confirmed for me that his company now uses noncommissioned brokers for small or inactive accounts . The five salaried brokers in his branch happen to be women . " They 're licensed brokers , yes , but they 're not Financial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Donahue  | assured me . " They do n't want the pressure of Buy 10,000 shares of XYZ . Sell 10,000 of .... ' They 're former secretarial types . What we call account assistants here . . . . Yes , I 'd say there 's going to be a lot more of them . " " Salaried brokers ! " Len was outraged . " That 's the direction management is pushing . Even here , fewer and fewer of the trainees that go through our program are really stockbrokers . They go through a training and it 's like cookbooks : mutual funds , C.D.s . They 're money raisers for the firms . But what do you get on a mutual fund ? A one shot commission and ... " " Say Len , " I interrupted , " can I interview you in person ? " " Why do n't you come in around 4 o'clock when the market closes . " I arrived early so I could watch a big trader at work . Deusenberg had a private office rather than a desk or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little rude for the next fifteen minutes , " he told me turning to his Quotron . Len was a pudgy fellow , in his early thirties with rolled-up sleeves and striped suspenders . He cultivated his old-fashioned trader image , enjoying the work and the effect . " Thought you 'd like to know , " he said into the phone , " Am Tech just reached 13 and it 's been . . . Well , it 's a start , you 're no longer at a loss . Did you take a look at Datanet ? Some of Len 's clients follow the market on their home or office computers . " Are you following Datanet ? " he asked on the next call . " On the charts it looks like rock bottom and there 's another reason . . .  | " This is Charlie Van Weisel , " Len introduced me to the dapper man who had just entered the office , " our top securities analyst . Back into the phone And another reason : Noonan said if it traded in the midteens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always been a man of his word . Away from the phone . She 's writing a book on the industry and computers . " Len completed the introduction and turned back to his phone call . Seeing a reporter , the analyst whipped out a copy of his weekly investment column . " Have n't watched a news program in years , " he began an unprovoked monologue . " Never buy The Wall Street Journal . . . separate the wheat from the chaff ... into the long-term trends . . . . You hear all this talk about oil prices going down . He paused so I could take down his predictions . After six months they 're going to be up . They say interest rates are going to stay down . They 're not . For the last four years I said up : they went up . I avoid the media so I can concentrate on the long-term trends . " " I 'm looking at trends in the relationship between the broker and the firm , " I said . " When I interviewed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of using computers to collect more customer information and to make the broker more dependent on ... " " I been in this business twenty-nine years , " Van Weisel announced . " It 's a trend . " " Wall Street is the last frontier , " Len interjected while waiting for a connection . " The days of the free-wheeling , freeenterprising broker are . . . Hello , yeah , I can hold . . . the firms are trying to intervene between the broker and the client . ... Hi , Barry , you been following Datanet ? " " There 's something to that , " Van Weisel said , " but they also want to know where the client is invested so they can get him out if there 's a problem . " Van Weisel is a partner in Len 's firm . " There 's another side to that , though . " Len continued con- ducting both conversations at once . " They want to get a wedge in between the client and the broker so that the client becomes the firm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to that too , " said the analyst , not really conceding the point . " If that call comes for me , I 'll be down the hall . " He took back his columns and gave me the benefit of a parting piece of advice . " Look ahead : see what the long term trends are . Write what people are going to want to read two years from now . " And he left . " Hey , Barry , congratulations ! " They just made him Chairman of the Board , " Len signed to me . Does that mean you 'll be so busy I 'll have to handle your account on a discretionary basis ? . . . Just kidding . " Len listened to Barry 's stockmarket forays while making pedagogical comments , " Good . . . excellent . . . I 'm proud of you holding onto the Dynamix , but you still have a tendency to pull out too short-term on the options . . . . Look , it 's hard learning , but for six months you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that much passive income ! . . . No , " he chided , " you wo n't buy the Datanet . You 'll wait till it starts rising because you 're so anxious not to buy it till it stops falling . " Charlie Van Weisel returned while Len was still on the phone . He called Len 's attention to an item which would be disseminated over the Quotron system the next morning as part of his daily report to the firm 's brokers . " Hey , Charlie , " Len called to the departing analyst , " Do n't announce it to the troops till I have time to act on it . Then back into the phone . Yeah that was Van Weisel . . . . Yeah , he and I go back a long way . . . . Well , listen , congratulations again .... And you just keep an eye on Datanet . " " You see what I was doing ? " Len asked when he got off the phone . " I was giving him leadership . And he also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( We made a lot of money last year in tobacco shares and platinum with Charlie 's research. ) "  | " Now that client , " Len continued , " happens to be a veteran engineer , just made chairman of the board , thirty-five years old , he 's a genius . And I 'm his broker . Of course he can go to a discount broker ? which I 'm sure he does sometimes . But he relies on me for the leadership . " There 's a big push to make us so general that we become clerks in a financial supermarket . Merrill Lynch , Paine Webber , Bache , Shearson are all selling insurance , real estate , financial planning . But the way I conduct my business is still 90 percent as an old-fashioned trader . " " Is there a lot of pressure on you to do financial planning , " I asked , " or to sell the company 's new products ? " " The pressure is intense . Eventually even the older brokers give in and do the company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ production , but you 'd be surprised how little that means . " " What is the pressure like ? " I asked . " I know it 's subtle but if you could put your finger on ... " " The subtle pressures ? " Len enumerated facilely , " Losing secretarial support , having your phone ripped out , being fired . It graduates . There are carrots and sticks . " One of the sweetest carrots at a brokerage is the kind of immediate access that Len Deusenberg has to analysts like Van Weisel . A common complaint of smaller or out-of-favor brokers is that they ca n't get hold of research reports and ca n't contact the analysts before making an important trade . " You see , they have a lot of information on you . Everything that 's in here tapping the computer they know . Generally there 's been a high regard in this industry for the specialists and aggressive traders . They 're the big producers . But now the companies have a grid of information to analyze exactly where each commission dollar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his weekly commission statement . According to the printout , he 'd brought in tens of thousands of dollars in commissions in several categories . But there were  | double zeros in the month-to-date column next to mutual funds and the company 's cash management fund . " They can do all kinds of breakdowns , what I did last month , last year , last week . How I did it , with what products . Just this morning I got a printout with my top twenty for the quarter . " " Top twenty what ? " I asked . " That 's , let 's see , he examined the printout he 'd tossed aside earlier in the day seems to be the top 20 percent , which individual clients generated the most commissions . I also get statements of which clients do n't have his firm 's version of the cash management account . Now some of this information is useful . But it 's all to sell stuff . " With computers the company can calculate not only how much business you 're doing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piece of business , By now a firm like Merrill may be making more from interest than commissions . So now the pressure on the broker is not only to do more business but to do it exactly our ' way . " But what happens when things change ? " Len asked rhetorically . " Stocks can go bad , bonds can go bad , commodities can go bad , financial planning can fizzle . " " The healthy way is to encourage a diversity of brokers so the house can survive in changing climates . But they 've got their grid telling them the one right way . Frankly , I 'm not sure they even know the most profitable way . Sometimes it seems we 're under pressure just to do volume . " " But you do n't do it their way ? " I asked . " You still do n't do financial planning ? " " My niche is bringing stock ideas to the attention of people willing to incur a businessman 's risk . The customer who 'll call me back and say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I like it . Buy me 1000 . ' " My clients want me to bring them ideas that they 're not going to hear advertised or read about in the paper . They can  | read a book on financial planning . Oh , I 'll do some of that for anyone who needs help . But most of the people in my book have taken care of that sort of thing a long time ago . Now they 're looking for the opportunity to make money and they understand the skill required . Of course anybody can look smart in a bull market , but my clients know the difference . They enjoy being partners with me in an activity that involves skill and risk . The moment I become less than a trusted advisor to the client , the easier it is to replace me . " As I was leaving Len asked if I knew anyone who could help him design a customized computer program . He was n't sure that the firm would let him run his own program on the company 's computers . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something speedier . " With their system I can only find out what 's in the client 's account as of the time the market closed yesterday . I want something that will update their accounts , real time , as I trade . " " You really love this business , " I remarked . " The money , the speed , the trading real time . " " You know how I got into it ? This is funny . I was in college and I saw an advertisement for a summer job : Sales Assistant , Lehman Brothers . ' I thought it was a clothing store . I thought I was going to be getting shoe boxes out of the back room . But I took to it immediately . " That 's still the great thing about this business . Just about anyone can give it a try , from all socioeconomic backgrounds . Wall Street is still the Wild West . Even with all the regulation it 's one of the last areas of entrepreneurialism . " " So personally you 're not that worried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never going to become a bank clerk or a salaried broker ? " " The salaried broker is the next step . You can see it coming . But I 'll stay ahead of it because I have clients who know the difference . "  | I asked Len about his long-range plans . Did he hope to go independent with his largest clients ? " You can never build your book to that point . People die , people go elsewhere . You 're always looking for new clients . " My ulterior motive is to get so good at trading with other people 's money that I can do it with my own money and then retire . " Len Deusenberg used the phrase " grid of information " to convey something that he felt closing in around the professional broker . Many data clerks , telephone operators , fastfood managers and airline reservation agents grope for that same concept as they find themselves hemmed in by multiple numerical ratings . Till now , most workers could only be measured by a couple of numbers at once : usually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ error rate . But computers can monitor more than just quantity and quality . They can measure performance on many scales at once . For the airline clerk , the hamburger flipper , the McDonald 's manager ? and now the stockbroker ? there are vertical factors ( How many reservations , How many burgers , Dollar volume per hour ) ; there are horizontal factors ( After Hang Up time , Fry yield , Crew labor productivity ) . In most cases , there are also what I call " diagonal factors , " subjective factors like tone of voice or McDonald 's QSC ( Quality , Service , Cleanliness ) . Even a factor like friendliness is reducible to a number . Dozens of vectors cutting vertically , horizontally and diagonally across a small work area result in a grid bisected so many ways that each person has only the tiniest space within which he can maneuver . As the number of numbers increases , the grid closes in around you . Eventually each square becomes so small that there 's only one possible way to move your arm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job .  | For managers and salesmen the grid of information has n't yet created the kind of physical constraint that it has produced for data entry clerks . A broker can still stand up , sit down or make a phone call . The computer is n't timing his bathroom or coffee breaks . But as Len Deusenberg pointed out , " With computers the company can calculate not only how much business you 're doing , but exactly how much money they 'll make on each piece of business . . . . So now the pressure on the broker is not only to do more business but to do it exactly our ' way . " The grid is tightening . But Deusenberg feels confident that he can keep ahead of it . So did the other well-established brokers I interviewed . As long as they had a book full of clients who trusted them , most brokers felt that they could ignore the pressures or pep talks urging them to do business the new financial planning way . There 's a wide range of " risk tolerance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roughly share his investment aesthetic . As it happens , most of the brokers I interviewed were conservatives . Or at least they considered themselves the opposite of an aggressive trader like Len Deusenberg . Yet to a man and woman , they echoed Len 's conclusion : " The moment I become less than a trusted advisor to the client , the easier it is to replace me . " Many of these successful brokers had always provided some form of financial consulting . They did n't object to the financial planning approach as long as they remained the trusted source of advice , rather than the firm or the firm 's computer program . For that reason it was difficult to find an established broker at Merrill Lynch or Shearson who used PathFinder , PRO or CollegeBuilder . I had to look among newer , less-confident  | employees until I happened on a broker using one of the computerized financial planning tools . " Row six , turn right , the desks are numbered . " The receptionist directed me to a statistically typical broker . He 'd been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My aunt had never met him . She 'd been told on the phone that he was replacing her former Financial Consultant , whom she 'd never met either . Still , she volunteered to call " her broker " for me and reported back that he sounded like an amiable man . " I try to do whatever the customer wants , " Michael said . Which may explain why he agreed to an interview . " My book runs from hundred dollar accounts to a million dollar account . I try to do what each customer wants . " " Do you act as their Financial Consultant , " I asked , " now that you 're officially an F.C. ? " " Well , in terms of evaluating their priorities he thought it over , yeah . But in terms of taking over the person 's total picture and trying to map it out , no . Most people tend to know what they want ? or have an idea . " " Have you ever used PathFinder ? " " It 's not the sort of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not from the company , are you ? " I explained again about the book I was writing and reassured him that all the brokers I interviewed would be anonymous . " So you 've never had any experience with Path-Finder ? " " Actually a doctor called and asked about PathFinder , so I sent him the form and I understand he 's returned it .... Yes ,  | completed . I guess they 'll send his report to me and then .. . I 'm not sure of the procedure . " I asked about CollegeBuilder , a newer Merrill Lynch expert system . " No , I never . . . wait . He skimmed through the papers on his desk . I think I just got one of those back . It went out to all my clients as a statement stuffer . " One way to reach over the broker 's head and go directly to the client is through the advertisements enclosed in their monthly statements . That month Merrill had inserted an application for the CollegeBuilder program . Michael searched his desk . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how to work it . Jeff , " he addressed a bulky young man sitting at the desk next to him , " do you know if that CollegeBuilder thing is up and running ? " " You have to be here before 8 in the morning or after 6 to run it , " Jeff explained . " I 'll do it for you tomorrow morning , " he reached good-naturedly for the form . Michael pulled back just perceptibly . " Funny , " said Michael , " the newer you are the more knowledgeable you are about the computer systems . " Jeff , the new broker , was as large , floppy and eager as Michael was slim and contained . " See how it works , " he leaned across Michael 's desk to show me the CollegeBuilder form . " They fill in name , address , phone number and then the names of their kids , grade in school and where they 're gon na go , like MIT , Yale or they can just fill in Public , Private , Ivy . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , asked his age , current federal tax bracket and demanded : Your Estimate of the Annual Inflation Rate of College Costs : ( circle one )  | " You use their estimate of inflation ? " I was surprised . " If they do n't fill it in we use 7 percent . And if they do n't fill in a tax bracket we say 25 percent . " Jeff showed me a CollegeBuilder plan . This particular printout , many times longer than the original questionnaire , anticipated costs of over $300,000 to send three specific children to three specific universities in the years from 1998 to 2009 .. CollegeBuilder calculated the annual savings necessary to pay the projected college bills if the parents began investing right now in TIGRS ( pronounced " tigers , " the acronym for Treasury Investment Growth Receipts ) to be held in tax-saving custodial accounts for each child . The numbers were specific and staggering . For Andrew , $5,760 a year ; $3,475 a year for Stephen ; and $3,862 for little Patrick , born just that year . " You use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bracket ? " GIGO , " I wrote in my notebook . That 's the professionals ' acronym for " Garbage In/Garbage Out . " And this really works ? " " It 's like offering cocaine to an addict , " Jeff answered enthusiastically . " There 's two things that make up the American dream . One is to put your kids through college , the other is to own your home . But putting the kids through college is the more difficult . If you buy a $150,000 house you have thirty years to pay it off . But the college , you have four years to do it . " A good point , I thought . Later I read the same thing in the CollegeBuilder brochure , but there it was a $90,000 house . So Jeff had " customized " the example for our part of the country . " Now , supposing the kid 's good enough for grad school , that 's three more years , or you think he 's going to be a doctor .  | Let 's say you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year 2004 , that 's $188,000 . . . . And the other MIT or Notre Dame , and Jeff rolled on unstoppable with horrifying numbers : $70,560 , $94,600 , $42,720 a year . And the check is due September 1 of the year 2000 . " " Have you actually gotten any new clients this way ? " I asked . " Have you sold any TIGRS through CollegeBuilder ? " " I called a lady today and she said to call her back . " " Do you make a commission on TIGRS ? " I asked Michael . " You make $3.80 to $5 on a TIGR-meaning on each $1000 in TIGRS . " " Each thousand at maturity , " Jeff interjected . " Is that good ? " " No , " Michael answered . " Besides , if you sell stocks and bonds you can expect to resell them in six months . Whereas TIGRS tend to be held for ten to eighteen years . So it 's only a one-time ... " " If you have your own client you do what you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're a newcomer you sell whatever you can . ... See , I could buy her Telephone , which I think will triple in ten years . But will it definitely ? With CollegeBuilder ... " Frankly , Jeff did n't seem to me like the kind of person who 'd make it as a broker ( though , remember , I 'd known him only a few minutes ) . His big puppylike enthusiasm and his very acceptance of all the new Merrill Lynch systems suggested that he was n't sharp or cool enough for Merrill Lynch . But maybe Merrill does n't need such sharp brokers anymore . Like the medieval church that discovered it could distribute holy sacraments through corrupt vessels , perhaps Merrill Lynch can now distribute shrewd advice through Jeff . After all , if their expert systems actually work , then a Merrill broker does n't have to know much more about investments than a McDonald 's cook has to know about food . The company still needs to hire some top-notch financial brains to formulate basic investment plans , but the bulk of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these plans . There 's no reason to pay enormous fees like 45 percent of total commissions to an ordinary salesman or " relationship man . " I left Jeff customizing a CollegeBuilder for the lady who 'd asked him to call back . " What 's the hardest part of being a broker ? " I asked Michael , expecting to hear about cold calling or paperwork . " Telling people about losses , " he answered simply . " Fortunately , I have n't had many losses of consequence , but there 's one client , an account I opened my first month in business . We 'd done a covered call with options . It was going to be a quick transaction ? in and out . But it got into trouble right away and it has never recovered . " " Was it the client 's idea ? " I suggested . " No . " There was a long pause and no excuses . " It was my recommendation . It was also a first-time investor . I lost a lot of sleep over that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you keep them informed . But now I have to call her and finally take the loss . " I had completely forgotten about losses . Every broker I 'd interviewed had such a convincing system , such solid information that even conflicting strategies all seemed sound to me , at least while I sat in their offices . Expert systems , even the less sophisticated ones , can protect against losses caused by inexperience . With an expert system , no one has to take advice from the firm 's new brokers . The advice comes instead from the firm 's homogenized " expert . " It 's as if every client sat down with the same planner on the same day . Of course , many investors have lost money following the firm 's daily recommendations . The blue plate special may not be any fresher than the waiter 's personal choice . An expert system does n't guarantee good advice or even cautious advice . But it guarantees standard advice . The system passes along whatever strategy the company adopts at the moment .  | But so far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to giving out only the " expert 's " advice . An established broker might use the system to do some quick calculations or to try some what-ifs . Or he might ignore it . He does n't automatically become a salaried broker doling out machinemade advice just because there 's a new program in his computer . Brokerage houses will have to do a lot more reorganization and a lot more education ( or de-education ) before they reduce the majority of brokers to the salaried status that Deusenberg forsees . The process is under way , but the resistance is strong . I was told repeatedly and semitautologically that brokers resist computers because they 're " resistant to change . " But very few professionals resist systems that bring them timely information . In fact , several of the brokers I met were buying or designing additional programs to keep ahead of other brokers . What they resist are computer programs that take information or autonomy away from em . The problem for the systems designers is n't how to get brokers to use computers but how to embed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brokers want . I was amazed how selectively established brokers " resisted " ( or ignored ) programs and products that tied the client closer to the firm . They were remarkably clear about their own interests . Stockbrokers may be the most class conscious of all American workers . Perhaps this is because they are n't really workers . They 're owners . But the thing they own is intangible . It 's the thing Willy Loman tried to describe to his brother , Ben ' : It 's contacts , Ben , contacts ! ... when he walks into a business office his name will sound out like a bell and all the doors will open to him ! I 've seen it , Ben , I 've seen it a thousand times ! You ca n't feel it with your hand like timber , but it 's there !  | Willy Loman 's intangible is the asset that brokers own ; it 's the property they take with them from firm to firm ; it 's the basis of their independence . If the broker did n't partially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to cajole or bribe him to use their new financial planning approaches and their new computer aids . They could simply order him , the way they would order any other employee . The tug-of-war over the customer has been going on long before computers entered the scene . Computers are only tools with many uses . But the battle for control turns tools into weapons  | As I write , brokers are just beginning to sense the career slide that 's been going on for two decades in social work . If I waited just a year or two longer , I could have set my brokerage story in a branch bank or the actuarial department of an insurance company . Knowledge engineers are busy cloning bank loan officers and actuaries now . Of course , this white-collar slide was n't caused by the computer or by the expert system . The same downward shift is being implemented in many different offices using many different tools . The discretion of Federal probation officers and Workers ' Compensation judges is being limited without the use of expert systems . New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Compensation minimize decision making by these professionals . But grids and schedules are n't " systems , " they 're merely pieces of paper . The important element is n't the computer program but the  | management determination to centralize decision making . However it 's implemented , the result is more clerks , whatever their titles , and fewer full-fledged professionals . Does this mean that expert systems work , that clerk-plusELIZA equals doctor , that clerk-plus-PathFinder equals bro-ker ? Consumer Union rated PRO , PathFinder and similar planners as being more like sales gimmicks than professional consultants . I 'd be surprised if any of the specific expert systems we looked at are still in operation by the time this book is published . And , so far , the original ELIZA is still a parody rather than a functioning therapist . I have , however , seen an ELIZAIike program in operation . Frankly , this one seems more like a farce than a parody . But I 'm going to describe it because so many similar systems are now being tried , and I 'm certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ methadone maintenance clinics are required to have a psychological and social history ( a " psychesocial " ) in each patient 's file . Since the understaffed clinics have no time for personal interviews , a company called Auto Assess , Inc. , provides a battery of fill-in-the-blank " PSYCH SCANS , " " carefully prepared , " says the company 's brochure , " to accommodate the limited attention span of clients and patients under stress . " So the addict , seated or nodding out in the waiting room , self-administers his Auto Assess PSYCH SCAN . His responses are keyed into computers by data clerks at The Creative Socio-Medics Corp . ( I did n't make up any of these names . ) Like PathFinder , PlanPower , or PRO , the computer program generates a narrative report . The report arrives back in the center within a week , clean , typed and ready to be filed  | away , without anyone 's having interviewed the patient or even having read his responses . In most cases this service is paid for by Medicaid . Many of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the computerized reports . " Very interesting , I see you had three to seven siblings . " They were not exaggerating . A sample in the Auto Assess training manual reads , " Since the age of 18 the client has been arrested four or more times . " Needless to say , this is rather impersonal compared to the few handmade psyche-socials I found in centers that still hired psychologists to conduct interviews . But even if the machinemade and the handmade reports were equally valid ( or equally useless ) , a self-administered questionnaire means less human contact for someone who may desperately need it . Imagine being handed a multiple-choice questionnaire on the day you finally decide to break the drug habit and get back into society . The Auto Assess questionnaire is another example of the Help Yourself approach to automating services . Just as bank customers enter their own data at money machines and airline passengers will soon enter the data to book and ticket themselves , psychological subjects can be asked to administer their own tests . It may seem ridiculous to serve addicts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't paying , they 're in no position to demand a custommade product . Right now , computerized human services are primarily distributed to the poor . When mass-produced clothing first appeared , it was also meant for the poor . Wealthy people saw it as a parody of tailormade clothing . Sleeves and collars fit the individual about as well as a PSYCH SCAN fits the individual . But even disdainful aristocrats had to admit that it did cover the body , and cheaply . ( And even I have to admit that a PSYCH SCAN does cover the facts , and cheaply . ) In time ( in fact , quickly ) , mass-produced clothing got better and even cheaper . Eventually some manufacturers began to offer more expensive " custommade " lines .  | If a PSYCH SCAN sounds like a joke , remember that we 're at the beginning of the automation of human services . Standing at this point in history , it seems obvious to me that a human doctor or a human financial counselor who talks to you personally will always be able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an expert system . But 150 years ago it must have seemed equally obvious , even to a clothing manufacturer , that a real tailor who measured the individual body could make better-fitting garments than any mass production system . This is still true . Yet today it 's hard to find that good tailor . And it costs a great deal to buy his services . But it 's easy to find good , or good enough , mass-produced clothing . Over the years mass production was developed and improved while skilled craftsmen grew scarce . I 'm certain that mass production of human services will also be improved . That 's not because manufacturing advice is a good or an obvious idea . We 've seen how hard it is to make an expert system with anything like human sophistication , even in a relatively cut-and-dried , dollars-and-cents area like estate planning . But this has n't deterred the creation of expert systems on bargaining strategy for corporate negotiators , on dinner-party seating for hostesses , on style and vocabulary for writers and even on employee and child discipline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rigid way , it may be basically wrong-headed to eliminate so much personal contact in the advice business . Perhaps human service should n't be so efficient . But the idea will surely be developed , not because it promises a superior product , but because it promises an inferior worker . After all , Merrill Lynch does n't want to hire 10,000 investment experts , each of whom does business his own way and has his own loyal clients . Most employers would prefer to distribute their products through cheap , easily trainable and easily replaceable employees . Perhaps even more important ,  | I just read about a new computer program called Productivity Map that will , according to Info World magazine , " help track the performance of managers the way other programs track inventory and sales . " Apparently , Productivity Map juggles numerical ratings for productivity factors in difficult-to-measure departments like Finance , Research , Personnel and Engineering and comes up with a single number that says how the department is doing at any moment .  | It sounds not only dreadful but also silly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ superiors can look at the computer at any moment and say , " All last week you were running at a 12 , but you fell to 9.5 after lunch today " ? Productivity Map 's development was funded by a consortium that included 3M , Westinghouse , GTE , Northern Telecom , Nabisco Brands and the U.S. General Accounting Office . I could n't see the program in operation because it was still in its test phase . To get a better idea of how it worked , I phoned Allison Kleebatt , an executive in Organization and Manpower Planning for GTE 's Human Resources staff . " Can it really come up with a single number a How 'm I doin ' ? ' for managers ? " I asked . " You got the medium and the message mixed up there , " Ms. Kleebatt informed me . She explained that the measuring system , called OM ( Objective Matrix ) has been around for a long time . Productivity Map was just a way of running it on a small computer . " Now OM is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measure productivity for any kind of white-collar worker . " " Even creative workers like programmers ? " I asked . " Programmers ? Hah ! There 's a mystique they try to keep up , but programming is production work . Her tone said mere production work . ' That 's been known for a long time . " " Even Human Resources , " Kleebatt democratically attacked her own department , " filling open positions , processing paper ; it 's already known to be production work . And the things people like to think of as being more creative ' like designing salary plans , designing promotion plans ; it 's production work . That 's already known . " " So you feel that OM could apply to departments like Engineering ? " I asked . " Oh engineers ! They 're the worst . They do n't want to think  | they can be measured . But if there 's an output it can be measured ; if there is n't an output , then what do they hold the job for ? " Many planners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creative to monitor , no output too intangible to count . But it 's unusual to hear anyone express such glee ? at least over the telephone to a stranger ? about finally measuring those creatives who think they 're too special to be reduced to nu tubers . Monitoring , measuring and routinizing are usually justified as means of reducing labor costs . The fact that they reduce people is supposedly incidental . When I started this research I myself believed that efficiency ? often miscalculated ? was the motive behind the degradation I was seeing . This corresponded with what I knew , or thought I knew , about the first industrial revolution . At the turn of the century Frederick Taylor , the original time study man in the steel industry , summarized the basic precepts of industrial automation in his influential books Shop Management ( 1904 ) and The Principles of Scientific Management ( 1911 ) . The managers assume ... the burden of gathering together all of the traditional knowledge which in the past has been possessed by the workman and then of classifying , tabulating and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All possible brain work should be removed from the shop and concentrated in the planning or laying out department .... The full possibilities of this system will not have been realized until almost all of the machines in the shop are run by men who are of smaller caliber and attainments and who are therefore cheaper than those required under the old system .  | The same principles were pithily restated for the computer age by a systems analyst at AT &T,; Paul Smythe , in 1977 . The work must be carefully organized in the programming department so that the great bulk of it can be done by $3.00 an hour clerks with virtually no training . So the first industrial revolution aimed at turning manual workers into " men who are of smaller caliber and attainments . " The second industrial revolution aims to turn the rest of us into " $3.00 an hour clerks . " This certainly sounds like the processes I had seen at McDonald 's and American Airlines , where " all possible brain work " was removed from the shop and concentrated in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sounds like the principle underlying expert systems . There , too , the brain work , the decision making , is centralized . For the majority of us , the nonplanners , the Taylor system limits decision making , restricts autonomy and reduces skills . As Taylor himself foresaw , it turns us into interchangeable hourly workers . These are not nice ideas . They mean that office , service and professional work are deliberately being arranged like factory work in order to make people cheap and disposable . When we 're reduced to a dime a dozen , we feel like a dime a dozen . To me that 's the worst part of this production system ; it makes people feel bad . Nineteenth-century Taylorism was n't practiced for the purpose of making people feel bad . It was all done in the name of efficiency . The theory is that you get a better , more consistent product by standardizing production ; you get a cheaper product by cutting labor costs . So you make a cheaper , higherquality product by using a cheaper , lower-quality worker . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into today 's most automated offices and try to buy a better ,  | cheaper service . In some cases you may be able to . But I do n't see any indication that most office automation is being planned for the sake of efficiency , in the old-fashioned " build a better mousetrap " sense . Instead of calculating how to make a cheaper product , offices seem to be automating automatically . The new equipment is then used as much for its labor-controlling abilities like monitoring and measuring , as for its labor-saving abilities like computing and typing All the traditional Taylorist costcutting procedures are applied with very little attempt to find out if they actually cut costs . For instance , despite all the monitoring , measuring and keystroke counting in modern offices , I ca n't find any study indicating that word processing has ever cut the cost of getting out a letter . Even less is known about electronic mail or electronic calendaring . Of course , executive offices are different from factories . Even if we did have some cost-benefit studies on word processing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Measuring memos and counting keystrokes ca n't tell you anything unless you know what all that communication is about . What does the office do ? Does it do it better with more memos and letters or with fewer memos and letters ? I should think that office efficiency depends , at least a little , on what all those drafts and final copies say . A hand scrawled " yes " on the bottom of a one-page proposal can be efficient if it hastens the production of some useful item . But what does a favor-currying memo contribute to productivity ? What do reams of legal-sized documents about a takeover contribute to a company 's profit ( or the world 's well being ) ? It may be efficient to put blinders on a horse , tighten the reins and lash him every so-many feet . But not if the carriage is racing in the wrong direction . So in the large sense , office automation has nothing to do with efficiency . Certainly , the billions invested in artificial intelligence ca n't       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
