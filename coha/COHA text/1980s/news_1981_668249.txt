It was my journalistic good fortune in the late summer of 1961 ( my first week in Washington ) to be ushered into the Oval Office to take part in a colleague ' s interview of President Kennedy . In addition to my paralyzing fright , I remember best his interrupting the proceedings briefly to take a call and then sharing with us the news that the Russians were summarily breaking the US-Soviet moratorium on nuclear-weapons tests . The call had been confirmation of reports he had earlier received . Kennedy then spoke of the response he would probably have to order - a resumption of American tests - which he subsequently did . All this came wafting back to intrude on my nostalgia as I was thinking about my two decades in Washington the other day . Since that August afternoon we have seen twenty frenzied years of international effort to 1 ) test , develop and deploy ever more sophisticated nuclear weapons and 2 ) negotiate agreements limiting their numbers and more menacing characteristics and the likelihood of their being used . How are we doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the second . For twenty years and many arms-control agreements later , the United States and the Soviet Union have put in place thousands of new nuclear explosives that can reach each other ' s heartland ; additional nations have acquired nuclear weapons , and the world is sitting around debating whether Iraq was three months away from a weapon , or five years , when Israel destroyed part of its " peaceful " nuclear installation . To many people the obvious conclusion is that the treaty-seeking part of the process has not been pursued with equal vigor . That may be true , but I think the relationship between our bomb-producing and bomb-controlling impulses is more complicated than that . Everyone recognizes the difficulty of adjusting the pace of political and diplomatic activity to that of technological change , and this is part of the problem . When the Russians , for example , moved on Prague in 1968 it became politically and diplomatically impossible for Lyndon Johnson to go forward with scheduled arms talks , and also impossible for him to hold back progress on the so-called MIRV @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plane . By the time it seemed feasible to the Nixon Administration to engage in arms talks , the Mirv- limiting opportunity was pretty much gone . There is another dilemma : although formal legalized commitments to forswear certain weapons and certain conduct may be required to achieve arms control , the accords themselves and the process whereby they are reached have , in some cases , the effect of increasing levels of armament , not decreasing them . The thought may strike you as radical and heretical . It is not put forward by way of concluding that all arms control ( for example , the ABM treaty ) has the perverse effect of building bombs or that treaty making should be abandoned . My idea is merely that at a moment when there is much agitation about re-entering arms negotiations with the Russians and in Europe and about the efficacy of the nuclear nonproliferation treaty , we could do worse than to reflect on the relationship , with a view to entering the next few rounds with a keener understanding of the risks . These are not , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the friends and enemies of arms control . In the friendly estimate it is the " process " of working out agreements ( the " SALT process " has almost been canonized ) that brings great benefit . Yet I think it is demonstrable that the " SALT process " has contributed to an increase in some of the most destabilizing and even slightly nutty weapons systems and proposals . You begin ( SALT 1 ) with a reasonable effort to limit those things that can be limited , which is to say seen and counted - i.e. , launchers . You then have a race to see how much ( before the next accord ) you can pile onto each launcher in the way of multiple warheads , etc . You end up with weapons so loaded for bear that you need to protect them at all costs from attack - ergo , MX , the monster , movable ( fugitive ? ) missile that no one wants hidden in his basement . This impetus that the arms talks may give to arms development is what is often wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those critics who believe that it is the likelihood of the other fellow ' s cheating that constitutes the danger of arms accords and arrangements to reach them . Yes , there is cheating . But I believe it is far easier to argue that the Russians , for instance , merely lived up to the maximum reading of the accords we have reached with them than that they went off and systematically and grossly violated them . Not always , but often , so-called " ceilings " in these accords become " floors . " Politically , at home , it may be necessary to go for everything allowed , whether you need it or not , under the treaty ' s terms ( in SALT 2 , it was even lamented that we were prohibited from acquiring certain types of missiles we didn ' t want ) . Sometimes it is the simple binge-before-the-diet instinct that comes into play , causing each side to stock up in a big way in the year or two that remain before a scheduled limitation goes into effect . You don ' t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ armed preparedness on our part to observe that this is a hell of a way to run a railroad - to make our weapons choices . And internationally the same is true:continuance of the already flourishing , dangerous trade in allegedly harmless nuclear technology and materiel between nuclear haves and have-nots was a condition of getting the nonproliferation treaty accepted in the Third World . That misguided traffic should have been much more severely limited and regulated years ago . Maybe Colonel Kaddafi will make the point - with a bang - one of these days . People will say we would have been much worse off without these agreements . I say we aren ' t so well off with them , and that in some measure , anyway , they have rationalized and incited increased arms production . Mytentatively offered point is that we need to look at the agreements we have made and are going to embark on in a much more intelligent , critical and unsentimental way .
