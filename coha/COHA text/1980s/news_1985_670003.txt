WASHINGTON  --  The House , signaling strong discontent with the Reagan administration ' s trade policies , approved by a large margin a bill that would cut back textile and apparel imports from many Asian countries . But opponents of the textile legislation were cheered by the 262-159 vote because it indicated that the measure doesn ' t have the support of two-thirds of the 435 House members . A two-thirds vote would be necessary to override a presidential veto , which has been threatened . " There ' re just not enough votes for this bill to become law , " crowed Rep. Sam Gibbons ( D. , Fla. ) , a leading opponent of the measure , after the vote . " Drinks are on me . " The vote was a significant test of the recent surge of protectionist sentiment in the House . Proponents said they wished to " send a message " to the White House and the rest of the world about their growing concern over the widening U.S. trade deficit . " We are saying to President Reagan that we insist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the component of fair trade , " said Rep. Bill Alexander ( D. , Ark . ) . Some supporters of the bill conceded they didn ' t really want the measure to become law . " Many who vote for this bill aren ' t voting for its provisions , " said Rep. Don Pease ( D. , Ohio ) during the floor debate . " They are voting to send a signal to the President that Congress is fed up . " The textile bill moved quickly through the House and at one time had almost 300 co-sponsors . Yesterday ' s vote suggests the measure lost support as it came closer to passage . " Today ' s House vote shows that congressional enthusiasm for self-destructive protectionism is waning , " said Clayton Yeutter , the U.S. trade representative . " If the House bill were actually adopted into law , it would cost American consumers $28 billion and would expose billions of dollars worth of U.S. exports to foreign retaliation . The growing recognition that these costs are simply too high led to the defection of many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and textile and apparel companies lobbied heavily for the bill . But a coalition led by major retail companies waged a vigorous campaign against it . A somewhat similar bill may reach the Senate floor in the next few weeks . The House bill wouldn ' t affect textile imports from Canada and Europe , but would sharply restrict shipments from 12 major Asian textile-producing nations . Those imports would be cut approximately 35% to 40% , according to preliminary estimates by the Ways and Means Committee . Those imports would then be allowed to grow 1% a year . Imports from " smaller textile-exporting countries , " defined as countries that account for less than 1. 25% of annual U.S. textile and apparel imports , would be subject to less stringent curbs . Such imports would be restricted to 15% growth in 1985 and 6% growth a year thereafter . Shipments of " import sensitive " products , such as wool goods and other items that account for 40% or more of the U.S. market , would be limited to 1% annual growth . The bill would allow Mexico and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imports , to follow the more generous restrictions allowed smaller exporters .
