Just a few years ago , the nation 's long-haul truck drivers were celebrated as the last cowboys . Sitting high and lonesome in 18-wheelers , they put the pedal to the metal , trying to outrun " Smokey " and middle-of-the-road conformity . The flip side of the image : stressful schedules and strained marriages . But now split-level suburbia is the new deal on wheels . An up-and-coming crowd of diesel outriders are bringing their homes and their wives along in fully outfitted , self-contained living quarters set behind the driver 's cab . If they need a handle , call this new breed truppies , upscale truckers who like to have a place to call home wherever they are . <P> Demand for the stretched-out sleepers began to heat up after a 1982 congressional decision allowing longer cab lengths without a corresponding cut in precious cargo space . A majority of the 15,000 tractors produced by California 's Peterbilt truck company now have some type of sleeper accoutrement . Double Eagle Industries of Shipshewana , Ind. , which expects to produce 250 of the longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Made of aluminum to save weight , the mobile home-like sleepers range in length from 28 in. to 120 in. front to back and cost from $2,400 for a basic single-bed model to $40,000 for a compartment more elaborate and feature filled than many recreational motor homes . <P> When Dan Campbell , 35 , who operates out of Cypress , Calif. , and Wife Robin , 30 , haul high-technology gear across the country for Bekins Van Lines , they haul a little high-tech luxury for themselves in their $35,000 , 120-in. - long cabin . While on the road , Robin prepares broiled chicken and fresh steamed vegetables in the kitchenette complete with a microwave oven . The thick pile carpet and acoustically padded walls are easily cleaned with the central vacuum- cleaning system . After dinner she may watch a prerecorded episode of Dallas on their VCR and remotecontrolled color TV . When 6-ft. 4-in . Dan stretches out on the double bed for a night 's sleep , Robin , who quit her job in a tax collection office to become one of the nation 's 48,600 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stereotype ? " We do n't associate with that , " says Robin . Indeed , they do not even communicate much with other drivers over the ubiquitous CB radio . They prefer to schedule upcoming jobs on a mobile cellular telephone . <P> Sleepers have solid business advantages , starting with time saving . Says Double Eagle President Ray Miller : " If a load of West Coast produce has to be East in three days , not three weeks , a husband and wife team with a sleeper can do the job . " Lone drivers must either bunk up at cracker-box motels or slump over the wheel after the maximum ten-hour stretch allowed by federal regulation . Spelled by co-drivers , truckers sometimes sleep in their living quarters or just stand , walk around and ease white-line tension . " The better the equipment , the safer the ride , " says Tom Phillips , 24 , who just purchased a $75,000 International Harvester cab with a 42-in. sleeper compartment . " A tired driver is a bad driver . "        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
