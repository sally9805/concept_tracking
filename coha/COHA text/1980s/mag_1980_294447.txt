FLO <P> March 24 , CBS , 9:30p.m . E.S.T. <P> <P> The TV schedule often reads like the Book of Genesis-or the Daily Racing Form . Happy Days begat Laverne &; Shirley ; Dallas begat Knot 's Landing ; Soap begat Benson . Now Alice has begat Flo . Polly Holliday has left Mel 's Diner in Phoenix to open up her own bar , Flo 's Yellow Rose , in her old home town , Cowtown , Texas . <P> As Holliday plays her , Flo is television 's Mae West : sex is the one thing she has on her mind , but , as she talks about it , in her barbecued accent , it is funny as well as fun . Rarely have a wiggle and a leer seemed so innocent . In this , her opening show , she returns to what must be the pokiest spot in the prairies , where the chief attraction is an indoor mall with an outdoor escalator . The local bar , where she spent the happiest days of her merrily misguided youth , is on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on her way to Houston , is persuaded to buy it . Her tight-lipped mamma ( Sudie Bond ) and Flo 's girlhood friend ( Joyce Bulifant ) pitch in to help make the place presentable , and we are introduced to what gives some promise of being an amusing cast of characters . <P> Coming just after M*A*S*H , which was No. 2 in the ratings last week , Flo has everything going for it but a knock down script . The best line is a leftover from Alice , " Kiss mah grits ! " The writ ing is not bad , by sitcom standards , but it is not nearly as good as Polly Holliday deserves . She is one of TV 's truly funny women , and she needs a script as frothy as the stuff coming out of the cooler at the Yellow Rose . <P> - Gerard Clarke
