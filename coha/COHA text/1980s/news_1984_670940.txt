Doris Turner , president of the striking union , District 1199 , Retail , Wholesale and Department Store Workers Union , A.F.L.-C . I.O. , told the wildly cheering crowd that she was " proud of this contract , " and she urged her membership to vote for it. // Union members danced in the aisles and swayed in their chairs in celebration . The tentative accord provides a 5 percent wage increase for each year of a two-year contract and guarantees union members every other weekend off. // // // Would Return This Week // If the agreement is approved , the workers would go back to work as early as tomorrow , and the hospitals would be required to accept all of them by Thursday . The strike has affected 18 , 000 patients and 52 , 000 workers. at 30 hospitals and 15 nursing homes in the city. // Officials of the union said that they would count the votes through the night and early this morning and that the results would be announced later today. // A voice vote was originally planned on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and largest health-care strike in the city ' s history . However , the union said Federal labor negotiation rules required a secret ballot. // Before the voting began , Mrs. Turner told the workers : " This fight was not just about a wage increase or benefits for the next two years . It was about our union building for the next 200 years and making sure our members can provide for themselves , their families and children yet to come. " // " We ' ve always had to fight , " she said , " and this is one thing the bosses will never understand : To protect ourselves and our families , we will put our bodies and our guts on the line. " // Mrs. Turner said the proposed settlement would give the members a wage increase of almost twice what workers were receiving in other recent labor contracts without yielding any of their " hard fought " benefits. // Repeatedly interupted by chants of " Doris , Doris , " Mrs. Turner said the hospitals , " motivated by greed and arrogance , " tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think we taught the hospital bosses a lesson , " she said , touching off an even louder response. // Just hours before the vote began at the Garden , the same tentative accord that was reached with the hospitals on Saturday was also agreed to by both sides in the nursing home strike. // Before the vote , the hospitals had threatened to begin hiring permanent replacements for the striking workers if there were no settlement. // <> <> Telegram From Cuomo // Governor Cuomo , in a telegram last night to Mrs. Turner , said the settlement was in the " best interests of the public ' s health-care needs " and of " union members and their families who suffered through the ordeal of a prolonged strike. " // Mr. Cuomo said earlier yesterday that the settlement was " reasonable . " It came , he said , " just in the nick of time , " given his warning that every day the strike continued posed increasing dangers to the lives of patients. // He also praised Archbishop John J. O ' Connor for " playing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Catholic hospitals in the New York Archdiocese about hiring permament replacements for the strikers. // However , Mr. Cuomo said he thought the workers should not ratify the settlement if they thought the state would provide new funds to help pay for it. // Because private nonprofit hospitals in New York are primarily supported by public funds , the state regulates how much income they receive and how much they can spend from revenue from such insurers as Blue Cross and Medicaid . Mr. Cuomo has pledged to continue the state ' s reputation as having one of the most stringent health cost containment programs in the country. // At a news conference after a speech to the state convention of the A.F.L.- C.I.O. at Kiamesha Lake in Sullivan County , Mr. Cuomo said he had " made it clear " to both sides in the strike that there would no " extra state money " to help pay for the settlement. // Mr. Cuomo said the only assurances state health officials had given hospitals was that if the state was wrong in projecting economic trend factors used in setting reimbursement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <> Doing ' The Right Thing ' // // The Governor has said previously that if adjustments were required in the future , he would do " the right thing . " State health officials said this had never been clearly defined. // " But if the negotiators for the hospitals or the union thought there was any suggestion that what we have told them is , ' Don ' t worry about it , we ' ll say we ' re not going to give you any more money , but then we ' ll come up with the money later , ' get it out of your minds right away , " Mr. Cuomo said yesterday. // However , Robert Carroll , a spokesman for the union , said : " That is not what the union thinks . Our contract does not depend on any deal with the state. " // James S. Vlasto , a spokesman for the League of Voluntary Hospitals and Homes , the bargaining group for the struck hospitals , said the league would have no comment. // However , league officials said a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sides in the presence of state officials , read as follows : " The settlement is conditioned on receipt of assurances from the state consistent with Governor Cuomo ' s statement on the trend factor. " // League officials said they understood that to mean that if the state ' s economic projections are wrong , then the state , at some time in the future , would provide additional funds to help pay for the settlement ' s higher labor costs. // If the state did not , William Abelow , the league ' s president , said on Sunday , either side could void the contract. // Mr. Abelow said last night that the league had made the condition part of the contract because " we wanted to put the Governor ' s assurance to do ' the right thing ' in a more definite form. " // According to both sides , the settlement includes major concessions from both union and management to insure a wage increase of at least 5 percent. // //               @ @ @ @ @ @
