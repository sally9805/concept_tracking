Opening in Dallas to bad reviews is hardly what most theatrical producers would consider an auspicious beginning . But it turned out to be just that in the case of Legends , starring Mary Martin and Carol Channing as a pair of feuding veteran stage actresses . Without benefit of critical acclaim or a stint on the Great White Way , the comedy by Playwright James Kirkwood ( A Chorus Line ) has grossed nearly $10 million since starting its 23-city run last January . This January the stars will end their touring in Palm Beach . " I was 73 the other day , " says Martin . " My body does n't have the resilience . People think it does because that 's all they see . But the next day . . . " Channing , 63 , who first met Martin when both were working on Broadway in the ' 40s , will also bow out . " I would n't consider doing it without Mary . The whole idea was doing it together . " The legends may be leaving , but Legends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spring . Alexis Smith is among those being considered for the task of following one of the ultimate hard acts to follow .
