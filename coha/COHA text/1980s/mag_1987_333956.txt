TIME 's beat is the entire world , and it naturally follows that our correspondents are among the airlines ' steadiest customers . In view of this week 's cover story on air safety , it is noteworthy that few of these reporters , many of whom log tens of thousands of miles each year , express fears for their own safety while aboard an aircraft . <P> Chicago Correspondent Lee Griggs , whose reporting figures heavily in this week 's cover , calculates that he has flown at least a million miles for TIME during the past 30 years . He has had more than his share of near misses : two flights from which he had deplaned , one in Hong Kong and another on Cape Cod , crashed at the next stop , with fatal results . On a third occasion he was the sixth standby for a flight from Tampa to Atlanta , but only four people ahead of him were taken . Shortly after , the plane crashed at Jacksonville , killing all aboard . Says Griggs : " I missed getting to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell about it . " <P> Miami Bureau Chief Marcia Gauger , formerly based in South Asia , recalls that she found it unsettling to fly on Pakistan International Airlines because as a flight approached its destination , a stewardess would customarily announce , " In ten minutes , inshallah ( ( God willing ) ) , we will be landing . " Says Gauger gratefully : " Allah never failed us . " <P> Several members of our staff have devised criteria for judging how nervous they ought to be . Among them are Washington Correspondent Patricia Delaney and Jerry Hannifin , who both contributed to the cover . " My first rule for comfort and safety is to fly when the smallest number of people do , " says Delaney . " I 'd rather get up at 5 a.m. on a weekend , when the capital is most romantic in the dawn blush along the Potomac , than face the mobbed 8 a.m. weekday flights . " Hannifin , a longtime pilot who has covered the aviation industry for TIME for more than three decades , maintains he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He nonetheless recommends sitting on the aisle in the plane 's midsection . Why ? " You have a choice of over-wing emergency exits . " New York Correspondent Joseph Boyce , only half facetiously , checks out the pilot . " It 's always good if he 's graying , " says Boyce . " That means he is ' experienced . ' But if he is completely gray and , heaven forbid , wears glasses , I begin to get uneasy . " Clearly , for TIME 's frequent flyers , humor helps keep worries about air safety in proper perspective .
