The mullahs impose their will with a vengeance <P> O Islam , what crimes they commit in your name ! - Abolhassan Banisadr <P> Their crime was that they had demonstrated against the dismissal of Banisadr from his post as President of the nation . The Islamic judge who sentenced them-Ayatullah Mohammadi Gilani-did not even know who they were . The twelve girls , the oldest 18 , the others under 16 , refused to identify themselves in court . When Gilani asked their names , each in turn replied , " Mujahed " ( Crusader ) . To the question " Child of ? " each replied , " The people of Iran . " Gilani solved the problem of identifying the girls by having them photographed . Then he consigned them to the firing squad . <P> Islamic guards led the dozen girls to the courtyard of Evin Prison in Tehran . The oldest was clad in a flowing black chador , the traditional Muslim veil . The others wore dark head scarves . As the guards began to blindfold them , the girls started chanting , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> In answer , the guards and prison attendants watching the spectacle began their own chant of " Allahu Akbar ! " ( God is great ) . Then the rifles roared . <P> Three days later , the clergy-controlled newspaper Ettela'at printed the girls ' pictures with a terse message asking the parents to call for the bodies . <P> The parents should bring , the paper said , " birth certificates bearing their the girls ' pictures . " At a press conference Gilani defended the trials and executions of the girls . " By the Islamic canon , " he said , " a nine-year-old girl is mature . So there is no difference for us between a nine-year-old girl and a 40-year-old man . " <P> Nor was there any difference between wanton brutality and justice in the Islamic Republic of Iran last week as security forces stepped up their search for former President Banisadr and his supporters . In the wake of nationwide riots between pro-and anti-Banisadr crowds , squads of Islamic Revolutionary Guards searched the homes of Iranians suspected of harboring the leader of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the past 17 months . Banisadr vanished after Ayatullah Ruhollah Khomeini dismissed him as chief of the armed forces three weeks ago . Since then , the government has charged Banisadr with unspecified " antirevolutionary and anti-Islamic acts , " thus clearing the way for a presidential election next month . <P> Meanwhile , a mass drive against dissidents was in progress , designed to quell all opposition to the final imposition of a theocratic Muslim state . So sweeping was the roundup that the jails could scarcely contain the torrent of new prisoners . The revolutionary firing squads were working round the clock . In the week following the pro-and anti-Banisadr riots , more than 50 men , women and children were executed . Some of the victims , like the writer and publisher Ali Asghar Amirani , were accused of " strengthening the Shah 's regime . " Others were members of the Bah ' faith , whose Iranian adherents , numbering between 300,000 and 500,000 , are regarded as heretics by Muslims .               @ @ @ @ @ @
