THE NATURAL Directed by Barry Levinson Screenplay by Roger Towne and Phil Dusenberry <P> In myth , baseball is a circle of light in a world increasingly darkened by corruption . It is a clean , green place that absorbs , preserves and reflects back upon us , through the heroically magnified deeds of its adepts , the purity with which , as children open to and eager for enchantment , we first encountered it . This game is a mind game , an ideal , and one that seems an almost lost legend for which people nowadays mourn , as they do for many things that graced a more leisurely and miraculous time . But baseball is also a reality , a game played by ungrammatical men who , like most people , have grown up without necessarily growing wise . They chew tobacco , indulge in alcoholic beverages and do not always fend off the groupies with the fervor expected of moral exemplars . <P> In all the literature that the sport has inspired , it is Bernard Malamud who best combined the mythic and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , published in 1952 , reads as if Ring Lardner and Sir Thomas Malory had simultaneously invaded Malamud 's sensibility , joining their gifts to produce an almost flawless first novel . <P> His tale was of Roy Hobbs , a ballplayer possessed of a talent and an innocence that could only have their sources in the supernatural . In Malamud 's baseball world , like Malory 's Arthurian one , men are ever the victims ; it is women who have the power to make them betray their best selves as well as the ability to inspire them to redemptive glory . In Roy 's case , all unknowing on the eve of his big league tryout , he answers a mysterious woman 's summons to her hotel room where she shoots him ( with a silver bullet , no less ) . <P> Still unaware of the forces playing about him , he achieves the illusion of redemption through 15 years of backroads wanderings , false heroic regeneration by using his magic bat as a kind of Excalibur , leading the aptly named New York Knights on a charge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he becomes a true hero to modernist eyes only when , ambiguously but courageously ( and with a good woman 's help ) , he achieves awareness of what his life and adventures mean . In literary circles this is known as coming to consciousness ; in the on-deck circle it is known as growing up . <P> It is easy to see why the notion of adapting this story has tempted moviemakers for three decades . Hollywood 's self-referential myths , far more than baseball 's , revolve around the seduction and betrayal of the innocent . But now that the deed is done , it is equally easy to see how this material can lead even the most conscientious and respectful writers and directors astray . The problem is that the true life of this novel , for all the bustling melodrama of its surface , is inward ; its highest pleasures are to be found in the silence it maintains about its deepest thoughts . It tips these only in a descriptive fragment here , a line of laconic , often funny dialogue there .
