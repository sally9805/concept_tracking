" We believe in rolling the dice , " said Cardinal General Manager Joe McDonald after trading the National League 's best all-around first baseman , Keith Hernandez , 29 , to the Mets for two strong-armed but suspect pitchers , Neil Allen and Rick Ownbey , both 25 . Allen , who was treated for emotional problems earlier this year , at the time of the swap was 2-7 with a 4.50 ERA and had allowed 57 hits and 36 walks in 54 innings . In 34 ? innings , Ownbey had given up 31 hits and 21 walks , was 1-3 and had a 4.67 ERA . St. Louis sent Ownbey to the minors but put Allen , once an outstanding reliever , in its starting rotation . // " If either one comes through , we 'll be all right , " McDonald said . " We have a surplus of outfielders , and we need pitching . Now we can move George Hendrick from right to first and give some playing time to three young outfielders  --  David Green , Dane Iorg and Andy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Louisville when he was brought up last Wednesday . // There were other considerations . One might be that the Cardinals agree with those hitters who are saying St. Louis Reliever Bruce Sutter 's split-fingered fastball has gone awry . Thus , Allen may eventually pay off as bullpen insurance . Also , Hernandez was expected to seek a whopping raise when his contract expires at the end of 1984 . " I ca n't say his contract did n't enter into it , " McDonald admitted . Furthermore , Hernandez ' batting has fallen steadily over the last four seasons , from .344 in 1979 to .293 as of the end of last week . // But Hernandez should help stabilize the young Met team , which became even more youthful last week when General Manager Frank Cashen made three other moves : Catcher Junior Ortiz , 23 , was obtained from Pittsburgh ; First Baseman Mike Jorgensen , 34 , was sent to Atlanta ; and pitchers Walt Terrell and Tom Gorman , both 25 , were brought up from the International League , where they were a combined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oquendo , 19 , and Darryl Strawberry , 21 , now starting , New York has made a 50% turnover from its Opening Day lineup . Obviously , the Mets also believe in rolling the dice . // " The only reason we did it was the speed , " said White Sox Manager Tony LaRussa about the trade of second basemen that sent Tony Bernazard to the Mariners for Julio Cruz . Through last Sunday Cruz was leading the majors in stolen bases with 33 . Another possible reason was Bernazard 's unhappiness with management , partly because he lost an off-season salary arbitration case . " Apparently , his heart was n't in it , " LaRussa said of Bernazard 's play this year . On the other hand , the Mariners knew that Cruz planned to become a free agent after this season . // With his speed , the switch-hitting Cruz would be ideal in the leadoff spot , which is where LaRussa wants him , at least against lefthanded pitchers . Cruz , however , prefers batting ninth . When he has led off , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's become ill . " I 'd put too much pressure on myself , " Cruz says . " I 'd feel if I did n't get a hit or get on my first time up and then score , that we 'd lose . " // Detroit 's Kirk Gibson became the first player since Jason Thompson in 1977 , and the 10th overall , to hit a fair ball out of Tiger Stadium since it was triple-decked in 1938 . Gibson 's blast to right , which landed on the roof of a lumber company , was officially measured at 523 feet .... Remember Terry Felton , whose 0-13 mark with the Twins in ' 82 made him a record-breaking 0-16 for the start of his big league career ? Well , Felton , who lost his first four decisions this season at Toledo , won his first game at any level since August 1981  --  and broke an overall 17-game losing string  --  by beating Pawtucket 5-2 .... In his first 76 games as a rookie last year , Texas ' Dave Hostetler hit 22 homers and batted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 82 and his first 41 this year he has hit only two homers and batted .180. // " It looks like a fastball , but it 's slow and it sinks . Even the ones they hit , they do n't hit very well . " That 's Baltimore Pitcher Mike Boddicker 's description of the oddball pitch that 's helped him build a 4-2 record and 3.02 ERA since coming up last month to replace ailing Jim Palmer . Boddicker , a righthander , began using his novel pitch when he was trying to learn how to throw a forkball at the University of Iowa . While vainly attempting to develop a proper forkball grip , Boddicker came up with a delivery that slips out of his hand , rotates slightly and breaks like a screwball . He has dubbed the pitch the " forkscrew . " Baltimore Pitching Coach Ray Miller , who feels the pitch is a combination of a forkball and a dead fish , has labeled it a " foshball. " // " I hate day games , " says California 's Rod Carew , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like to contend with shadows late in day games . " You 're always blinking , fighting off all kinds of glare . You see the ball better at night . There 's less tension in your eyes at night . " Maybe so , but through last Sunday Carew was batting .463 in day games and .382 at night for his overall .409. // With his 12th homer and league-leading 46th RBI , Minnesota 's Gary Ward defeated Texas 4-3 . Astonishingly , that blow also gave Ward only his first game-winning RBI . Tom Brunansky is hitting .194 but leads the Twins with nine game-winning ribbies , second in the league .... With Lenny Faedo hurt and with Ron Washington at his father 's funeral , the Twins brought up Houston Jimenez from the minors to play shortstop . The 5 ' 7 " , 142-pound Jimenez was only 2 for 21 at the plate , but his glovely work in the field helped Minnesota win four games in a row . " He made some plays that were sensational , " said owner Calvin Griffith , who wants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . // In his first start in 18 days , Alejandro Pena of the Dodgers gave up seven singles in 8 ? innings and beat the Braves 6-1 . Except for one relief appearance , Pena had been out of action while under-going extensive medical tests , which determined that he has chronic migraines . By winning , Pe ? a improved his record to 6-1 and pared his ERA to 1.93 . " He does n't throw quite as hard as Nolan Ryan , but his fastball has the same sinking and inside movement , " said Atlanta 's Dale Murphy , who took an 0-for-4 collar , striking out three times . // " My players ' biggest problem was that they did n't know they 're as good as they are , " says Detroit Manager Sparky Anderson of the Tigers ' turnaround since a May 13 meeting in which he told them they were n't making use of their talents . " Right now , they 're finding out because they 're playing hard every game . After the meeting , a few players said to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // Apparently they did . At the time of the meeting , the Tigers were 12-15 and last in the American League East . Since then , they 've been the hottest team in the league , going 23-14 through Sunday and climbing to third . // Giant Pitching Coach Herm Starrette used one of his pet ploys to try to help struggling Reliever Greg Minton . " I asked Greg to take a little infield practice , " says Starrette , " and he fielded the balls and threw easily to home or first . Then I asked , ' How are you throwing so nice and loose ? ' Greg realized what I was doing . He had been tight and was aiming his pitches . " // " It sure felt different , " said Minton after taking his looser delivery to the mound . " Suddenly , I was feeling the old motion , and instead of wondering if I could throw a strike , I 'd throw and know it was a strike without even trying . " // In his six complete games , five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an average of 16.3 ground ball outs .... Shortstop Rick Burleson is at the Angel farm team in Edmonton continuing his comeback from a rotator cuff tear . Through Sunday , he was 8 for 31 with two throwing errors .
