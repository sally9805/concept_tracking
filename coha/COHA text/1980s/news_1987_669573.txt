Only Warhol remained true to Pop Art ' s contention that the banal , if treated in a banal fashion , could become art , and that the artifacts and personalities of pop culture , rather than debasing or trivializing true art , actually energized and legitimized it. // // Even a short list of some of his favorite subjects - Campbell soup cans , Brillo boxes , Coca-Cola bottles , Mickey Mouse , Dick Tracy , and Superman - indicates the extent of his commitment to pop culture . But that wasn ' t all . More than any other artist since the 18th century , Warhol was fascinated by fame and fashion and went out of his way to cultivate and mythicize them . His first attempts were relatively straightforward : mechanically reproduced multiple images of such contemporary folk heroes as Elvis Presley and Marilyn Monroe . But these soon gave way to more blatantly coloristic , photographically derived depictions of art , society , show business , and fashion celebrities , ranging all the way from Martha Graham to Yves St. Laurent and including almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be described as fashionable or famous. // Celebrity and fashion , in fact , were the twin realities upon which his entire career was predicated . A passion for both permeated everything he did , whether as commercial artist , painter , photographer , filmmaker , social gadfly , art-world seer , or magazine publisher . And as though that weren ' t enough , his extraordinary talent ( some would say his genius ) for self-promotion made it inevitable that his celebrity status would equal , if not surpass , that of those whose success he held in such high esteem. // His beginnings for all that , however , were humble - although the circumstances surrounding them remain a bit vague . We are certain only that he was born , probably in 1928 , to Czech immigrant parents somewhere in Pennsylvania , that he attended the Carnegie Institute of Technology for four years , and that , shortly after moving to New York in 1949 , he embarked on a successful career as illustrator and commercial artist. // His ambition lay elsewhere , however , and in 1960 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gallery and museum world . His first canvases consisted of large , rather loosely executed brush drawings of Superman and Dick Tracy to which he added a few touches of color for effect . Although they attracted some attention , they did not immediately overwhelm the art world . Undeterred , Warhol painted the first of his Campbell soup can pictures and exhibited them in 1962 in both Los Angeles and New York . Success of the most sensational kind followed . Galleries and museums around the world vied for the opportunity to show his work . And when , in 1963 , he also began to produce underground films of considerable notoriety , it quickly became obvious that a new star of the first magnitude had appeared in American art. // By 1965 , Warhol was on top of the world . He was acclaimed internationally as the most original and significant artist to appear since Jackson Pollock exploded on the New York art scene in the late 1940s . Even those who didn ' t like what he did admitted he had turned art upside down and that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His champions , of course , went even further . They declared that his decision to totally eliminate the artist ' s personal touch through the use of mechanically reproduced photographic images serially laid out on large canvases was an act of genius unequaled since the days of Cubism . And that his pragmatic approach to art , his wholehearted acceptance of the most banal aspects of pop culture , and his spectacularly swift rise to fame and fortune were not only typically American , but worthy of emulation by all art students as well. // His example had an immediate and far-reaching effect . Almost overnight , Mickey Mouse , banality , and the mechanics of mass production threatened to replace the values and ideals of both traditional and modernist art . The belief that an artist should dynamically engage the issues of his or her culture , for instance , and strive to enhance and energize mankind ' s perceptions and understanding of the world was ridiculed as hopelessly old-fashioned . The artist , we were told , should remain passive and uncritical , should not engage in matters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best , remain a detached and ' ' innocent ' ' observer. // Fortunately , it took only a few years for all but a few diehards to conclude that the idea that art should be static , de-energized , culturally and morally indifferent , and lacking in any evidence of human sensibility led nowhere . And that to follow Warhol ' s example was to attempt to create art in a vacuum. // Even though , for all practical purposes , Warhol passed into art history around 1968 , the momentum of his fame and the totality of his followers ' commitment was such that three or four more years had to pass before the art world realized his era had ended . Not surprisingly , however , the myth of his greatness , fed as it was by his brilliant self-promotion and his well-publicized attendance upon the fashionable and famous of the world , continued on as before . Nothing deterred him . When new art-world celebrities emerged , he was certain to be seen in their company or to be reported as collaborating with them. // Throughout , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but always a bit more garishly than before and always with less and less impact on the gallery world . And yet , his myth lived on - and indeed seemed to shine ever brighter as Andy Warhol the celebrity increasingly eclipsed the Andy Warhol who had once aspired to create art. // //
