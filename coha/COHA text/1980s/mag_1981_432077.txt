 | For 13 months , George Allen seemed to be a meticulous , capable chief of medical services for Tennessee 's prison system . Then , acting on an anonymous tip , authorities discovered that Allen , a former operator of a tavern and flying service , held no medical degree . To land the job , he had assumed the identity of a retired Navy surgeon . Allen still works in a prison ? but this time , on the other side of the bars . Like state officials in Tennessee , many other employers are finding people on their payrolls who are n't what they , say they are . Authorities say that impostors too easily and too often slip through the cracks to land jobs for which , in many cases , they are not qualified . Sometimes the consequences are disastrous . Some recent instances The reputation of the Washington Post was besmirched by a young reporter , Janet Cooke , who was hired in large part because of the impressive academic credentials she claimed , but which the newspaper never verified . Only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Cooke 's story about a child heroin addict did it discover that both the story itself and her claims of college degrees were fabricated . An ex-Army medic and high-school dropout , using credentials " borrowed " from his cousin , successfully masqueraded as a doctor and treated newborn infants for three years at the University of California Medical Center in San Francisco . His ruse was discovered when he applied for a full-time faculty position . A woman described as " bright , articulate " and having " all the answers " was hired as deputy budget director for the city of Aspen , Colo . A personnel shortage deterred city officials from checking her references . After a month on the job , the woman diverted $2,900 to her personal account . She later confessed and now is in jail . A background check would have revealed that she was previously convicted of check fraud and forgery in New Mexico . An Ohio man was hired earlier this year as a vault custodian for Purolator Armored , Inc. , in Denver , after passing a polygraph exam and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ driller . Working alone on June 1 , he absconded with 1 million dollars in cash from the vault . The FBI later discovered the man had assumed the identity of a childhood friend , complete with a phony birth certificate . His current whereabouts are unknown . While not all incidents are as dramatic as these , experts have found many thousands of instances each year of persons using phony credentials in order to get jobs . Falsifications range from exaggerations of college grades or previous job duties to outright lies about past jobs held , schools attended or degrees earned . The most common ruse , say employers , involves exaggeration of college background . " The pressure for higher education has pushed some people over the line , " says Richard Bond , director of placement at the Adolph Coors Company of Golden , Colo . " It 's very easy to get a college degree without ever going to college . " Some of the fraud is uncovered by employers during routine background checks . Much of it is not . " The practice of falsification is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Verification Service , a 2-year-old business in Minneapolis that checks degrees for employers . Many are " gun-shy . " Privacy laws and fear of lawsuits prevent many employers from delving more deeply into the backgrounds of job applicants . " Beyond the simple statements of having been employed , reason for leaving and whether or not the employer would rehire , you do n't get much information and you do n't give much , " says Richard Hallstein , vice president at Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh . Adds an official at New York Hospital : " Most of us in personnel are gun-shy . " But as concern mounts over the veracity of employes , one employer after another is taking added precautions to ferret out impostors . As a result , business is brisk for executive-search firms and investigative companies such as Fidelifacts , a New York-based company that checks employe backgrounds . It now conducts 20,000 checks a year , compared with 7,000 six years ago . Says Thomas W. Norton , the firm 's president : " We 've been in operation 25 years now , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everyone were honest . " Investigations range from a cursory check of references listed on a job application to a full-scale probe of an applicant 's personal and financial history . Banks and investment companies often go to great lengths to check out would-be employes . Many require applicants to submit to polygraph tests and fingerprint checks . Stanley Slowik , director of the Denver office of John E. Reid &; Associates , which conducts  | polygraph tests , says that about 60 percent of its exams are for private employers . " The trend toward cautious pre-employment processing is definitely out there , " he says . The New York brokerage firm of Bache , Halsey , Stuart , Shields &; Company gives lie-detector tests to applicants who will be handling negotiable securities and uses security personnel ? usually former policemen trained to sniff out inconsistencies ? to screen all prospective employes . But financial institutions and investment firms are not the only ones that go to great lengths to check prospective employes . Coors Industries requires pre-employment polygraph tests . Thomas Industries of Louisville , Ky. , a tool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all background material , including personal financial data . Sizable investment . For jobs paying more than $20,000 a year , Thomas sends investigators into an applicant 's neighborhood to ask about personal habits and finances . For $25,000-a-year jobs , applicants must submit to psychological tests . " It 's a sizable investment that the company makes in hiring an executive , " says Gilbert Grady , head of the firm 's employe relations . " You just ca n't afford many mistakes . " New York Hospital also requires fingerprint exams of its new employes . But Henry Bertram , associate director of human resources , notes that mere mention of the check usually is enough to scare off undesirable people . The fingerprints , he says , " are rarely screened because it takes too long for law-enforcement agencies to process them . And most agencies just do n't have the time . " How frequently do these efforts turn up impostors ? Fidelifacts reports that it finds " something an employer should know about an applicant " in 30 percent of its cases . Says Fidelifacts ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , outright lying or facts indicating the applicant is unqualified for the position . " Maloney of the National Credential Verification Service reports similar results . In a two-month period , her firm found that 7 out of every 20 sets of credentials examined were falsified . Employers who do their own checking generally find fewer discrepancies . Foremost-McKesson , a San Francisco drug manufacturer , reports that about one quarter of its job applicants who undergo polygraph tests are screened out . The Bank of America says it finds only about 1.5 percent of its applicants misrepresent themselves in some way . Not all firms are concerned about the problem . " We subscribe to the theory that most people are honest , " says Charles Slack , personnel director at Goodyear Tire &; Rubber in Akron . Goodyear verifies academic credentials of persons hired directly from college and checks the employment history of others . But it does not verify educational background if a person has been in the job market for three or four years . Slack says Goodyear used to do so , but found few instances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he says . Larry Hastie , a vice president of Bendix Corporation , says that background checks have not been very cost effective . " We have not found , in our history , that people falsify a lot of their experience , " he adds . To some employers , how a person performs in a job and fits into the organization is more important than having correct credentials . At Bank of America , for example , if falsification is discovered after a person is hired , the employe is confronted and asked for an explanation . But if work has been satisfactory , the employe usually keeps the job and personnel records are corrected . " Performance is what counts in our industry , " adds the personnel director of a large California electronics company . " If we 're getting that , we can be very forgiving about a false or inflated degree . " Still , the hazards of hiring impostors persist ? especially when sensitive jobs are involved . Consequently , experts urge employers to take greater pains in checking the background of job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that employers be especially wary When the job involves fiduciary responsibilities ? such as purchasing or accounting ? health care , handling of children or money . When annual salary for the position exceeds $15,000 . When job qualifications include a master 's or doctoral degree . When , once hired , a new employe does not perform at a level commensurate with reported experience and background . Says Paul Barada , head of Barada &; Associates , a reference-checking firm in Rushville , Ind. : " You can avoid making some extremely expensive hiring mistakes simply by being a little more thorough in trying to find the best person you can .
