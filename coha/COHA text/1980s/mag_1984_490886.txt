THE TALK , OF THE TOWN Notes and Commem WE have been hounded in our mind by a phrase ; we have applied strong chemicals to efface it , to no effect . It is " besotted with her lure . " We repeat : " besotted with her lure . " It has a place , and characters , attached to it ; that is part of the problem . The place is a recent issue of Town &; Country now unavailable at newsstands ( but fresh in our mind ) , and the characters are Vicomtesse Jacqueline de Ribes and Yves Saint Laurent . The Vicomtesse , who is well known as a person to whom clothes have been kind , has now agreed to share her clothes with others ( in the sense of designing some and selling them ) , but the photographs of her that appear in Town &; Country ( against the background of her house in Paris ) are not entirely generous in spirit . You may have the clothes , but they were never really the point . The real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pictures seem to convey . " Friendship " is surely a treasure beyond price , in the eyes of the Vicomtesse , and , like the " tablescape " on pages 212-213 ( " laid .. . but twice before , for a president and a princess " ) , the friendships of the Vicomtesse are only half shared with the readers of Town &; Country . We are sure she would insist that we leave the room before an actual friend came in to exhibit his friendship . These things are private . Absolutely , they are . Let 's go back to the " tablescape " ( " laid . . . but twice before , for a president and a princess " ) . It is true that we are shown the " tablescape " ( " The boxwood arranged leaf by leaf , the napery in sharp folds  --  the table is as much a triumph of form as formality , and reveals the care she takes in an enterprise as small as a dinner , as grand as the films and ballets she 's produced " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and there is no vulgar set of instructions about how to reproduce the " tablescape ; " in fact , we imagine that the Vicomtesse almost forbids its reproduction . No , this is wrong ; what we think is that she is through with this " tablescape , " and no one will ever see it again . Friendship , of course , does not grow stale . We would be wrong to compare friendship with a " tablescape . " Friendship of a certain sort gives to a person a distinction not to be had merely by dressing well or by owning a chain of hotels . Zuleika Dobson , for whom the Oxford boat crews committed suicide , is without doubt the most elegant woman ever conceived . But English . What Town &; Country might be saying about Yves Saint Laurent 's emotional state when he writes about the Vicomtesse de Ribes will have to represent what the French are capable of at the moment . " ' She radiates the brilliance of a thousand lights , ' he 's written , besotted with her lure . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dressing well cheapened , will women seek  --  or insist upon  --  this sort of reaction from male friends as proof of distinction ? This is the thought that disturbs us : that they will . We see a nightmare world in which there are public-relations battles over intoxicating friendships . In our darkest moments , we see Donald Trump besotted with the lure of Leona Helmsley , Jeane Kirkpatrick bewitching Caspar ( Cap ) Weinberger . It was better when it was just clothes . Three Classes BABEL : NOW we report a curious , word-crossed moment we experienced in the talkative city of Washington , D.C. , on a gleaming ( lay that made the capital look even more immaculate than its pictures  --  a day beyond language , worthy of flags . We had been invited by Dr. Margareta Bowen , the director of the Division of Interpretation and Translation at Georgetown University , to visit a class there , and we took a morning walk to the university 's new Intercultural Center , a warm , inviting building of brick and glass , which let a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt , on a day like that . Dr. Bowen was waiting for us , a quiet woman with keen , amused eyes . We followed her down a corridor to a long , high room that had four glass-fronted booths for interpreters along one wall and , along the other walls , a clock and a map of Europe , and two whiteboards with red words written on them . ' Fen students , most of them young women , were sprawled about a long central table , which was well furnished with listening posts and a movable microphone . They were talking with a strong-faced , whimsical man with a resonant voice . We were introduced to the students , whose names evoked worlds very distant from Washington , and to the man  --  Mr. David Bowen , Dr. Bowen 's husband . He told us that the session was designed to give the students practice in both simultaneous and consecutive interpreting , and explained that most interpreting before the Nuremberg trials , in 1945 and 1946 , which brought simultaneous interpreting to the fore , had been consecutive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it was given and then delivering the translated gist . Dr. Bowen orchestrated the session . Miss Savine Schreiber , a student from Switzerland , had been reading over the weekend a book called " Der Koenig , ErzAlung , " by Gerhart Ellert , about Jerusalem in the twelfth century , and would deliver a short commentary on it in German , she announced in English that to us recalled Vienna . Dr. Bowen assigned four other students to the glass booths . Miss Janine Hamann-Orci , a girl of German nationality who had lived in Belgium , would translate Miss Schreiber 's commentary simultaneously into English . In the next booth , Miss Luisa Duarte-Silva , a slim , dark girl from a Portuguese family living in Spain , would translate simultaneously into Spanish  --  not from the German , which was not one of her languages , but from Miss Hamann-Orci 's English version . In the third booth , Miss Isabelle Polneau , from the Ivory Coast , was to translate simultaneously into French , also from Miss HamannOrci 's English . And Miss Margaret Zandrowicz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had grown up in France , was to provide an alternative French version . We fixed our earphones in place , and Miss Schreiber began . Her sentences were barely over in German before they started up in their English , Spanish , and French forms . Dr. Bowen and her husband were switching from channel to channel and making notes on pads of computer paper in front of them . Miss Schreiber was giving an account of Guy de Lusignan , king of Jerusalem when that city fell to Saladin in 1187 . The book 's personages took on different labels in the earphones : we caught Miss Duarte-Silva making Richard the Lion-Hearted into Ricardo CorazOn de Leon . We managed to follow the German word ruchlos as it became sans merci to Miss Zandrowicz and ruthless to Miss Hamann-Orci , while Miss Duarte-Silva , finding no one-word equivalent in Spanish , offered both duro and brutal . When Miss Schreiber had finished , Dr. Bowen picked out one of the students at the table , a tall girl from Wisconsin named Kathleen Zwicker , to begin , in English @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the notes she had taken , and through these she picked her way . Sister Mary William Lapointe , a nun from Massachusetts , completed the pr  --  cis in French , and Dr. Bowen asked questions in various languages about Miss Schreiber 's commentary . In response to a signal from Dr. Bowen , Miss Schreiber replaced Miss Polneau in the booth , like a player being sent into a game , and proceeded to translate the discussion simultaneously into German . As we asked Mr. Bowen a few questions , tongues in the four booths wagged away in our wake . We heard a question we asked come back to us through our earphones in Spanish in Miss Duarte-Silva 's voice , dragging a little at first and then breaking into a rush of words to catch up . What we had said was also plodding along after us in French and German , the languages coming through the earphones like divergent echoes . ? THE NEW YORICER Switching language channels , we found that as the words multiplied in our ears words and sense seemed to divide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threads at once . Our attention seemed like a clogged switchboard , and we had to remind ourself that the experience we were undergoing was hardly an ordinary one , except possibly to the deranged . The discussion had turned to the subject of assassins , with Mr. Bowen now asking questions in Spanish , and Miss Duarte-Silva therefore remaining silent in her booth . ( " Students love to be in the booths , " Dr. Bowen had told us . " They can imagine themselves into importance  --  they 're on their own , less like students , really interpreting . " ) Miss Zandrowicz was waving eagerly from her booth , and was released , to be replaced by Mr. Antoine Napel , from Senegal . She then spoke , in breathless French , about the connection between assassins and hashish  --  remarks that her fellow-students were meant to be digesting fully while they translated them , either simultaneously or consecutively . For our part , we found that the listening and the understanding often veered apart , and we had to strain to hang on to each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interpreter we watched work once at a meeting in Geneva . He was translating a speech , in Russian , simultaneously into Spanish , and he was reading , simultaneously , the sports pages of the Journal de Geneve , in French , turning the pages attentively while his lips moved in Spanish and he listened in Russian . When Mr. Bowen called for a break , our relief was that of a galley slave told he could stop rowing . We went upstairs to a relatively voiceless coffee lounge and talked with Dr. Bowen . " You will have noticed that we keep the formality of Mr. ' and ' Miss ' in class , " she said . " Our sessions are rather intense , and the formality is necessary . Our profession , besides , is a formal one , with a precise etiquette of its own . " We asked Dr. Bowen how she came to the profession . " I was in Vienna after the war , and was adept at languages but did n't want to be a language teacher , " she told us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then . I came to this school in 1955 , gained some experience as an interpreter , and returned here to teach in 1972 . My husband and I both work as interpreters in summer , out of Vienna . He was taught French , with an Irish accent , by his father , and then , as a G.1. , saw the war-crimes tribunal in Japan , and decided to be an interpreter , studying afterward in Paris and Madrid . We are probably unusual in having chosen the profession , for a lot of interpreters are chosen by it : people who have several languages by accident rather than intention  --  through migration , through exile , through having parents of different linguistic nationality . " We asked her about the students . " We have a fairly stringent entrance exam , " she said , " and we require proficiency in three languages  --  one the A language , the mother language , into which students translate , and two B languages , out of which they work . But we make exceptions  --  Sister Mary William , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between English and French only , since that is all that her order requires . We admit a class of between ten and twenty , and if the students complete two semesters of course work they receive a Certificate of Proficiency as a Conference Interpreter , and then they enter the swim . The African students all go back home , for there is plenty of work for them . The Latin Americans used to , but now they stay , or move to Europe , where there is much more work for varying language combinations . Being in Washington , we are able to bring in working interpreters from the international organizations to help the students . There is a certain superstition that interpreters are born , not made , so when our students begin to notice how much better they get with practice they work very hard indeed  --  they almost live here . " On our way out , we looked in again on the class . Mr. Napel , in the role of the President of Senegal , was making a mock speech of welcome in French @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course of it . " It 's a curious profession , ours , " Dr. Bowen said as she led us back to the day . " Only when interpreters make errors , or are otherwise inept , are they noticed . If they are very good in their profession , they achieve an absolute anonymity , they do not exist . It 's not everybody who is attracted by that . But some people are . " ? WILD ONES : Sometimes we wor- ry that we 're growing sedate . Why , we think , are n't we nightly engrossed in joyous bacchanals ? Why do we seem to get in so few fistfights ? Why , when we get to the sad nub of it , are n't we more like Mr. T ? Such fears drove us recently to another class , this one a New School seminar called " The Wild Man and the Wild Woman . " A two-day extravaganza devoted more or less to the Wild Man as a medieval literary figure , it began with a Friday-evening performance . When we arrived , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Robert Bly , who was to lead the seminar with Gioia Timpanelli , was outside the small auditorium tuning his bouzouki . A bouzouki is a stringed instrument from a foreign land which he sometimes plucks while reading his poems . When the bouzouki sounded right , Mr. Bly joined Ms. Timpanelli onstage , and they took turns performing . She told stories , including one , from the Arthur cycle " Yvain , " about a creature who was seventeen feet high and tusk-equipped and who bade a knight throw some water on a certain stone  --  a gesture that produced inclement weather and irked another knight , who showed up carrying a big lance . Mr. Bly read his poems , our favorite of which included the lines : If the fragments of the unconscious could grow big as the beams in hunting lodges , Then the tiny black eggs the salmon lays in the luminous ears of nuns would be visible . He also talked a little about the idea of the Wild Man . " According to the Grimm Brothers ' story ' Iron Hans , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bucketed out , what is found at the bottom is not a worm or an accountant but a Wild Man , covered with hair from head to toe . " That image was enough to draw us back for the second day of the seminar , a seven-hour workshop attended by forty people who had paid seventy-five dollars apiece . We arrived late , in the middle of a lively discussion of the Goose Girl story . " I really feel it 's not a true Wild Man story . It does n't take place in the woods , " one man complained . " Now , Mr. Academic , I would n't press that too far , " said Mr. Bly , who seemed a bit hot . " We 're not in a romantic situation now where we can he entirely animal and entirely in the woods . " That sort of technical talk continued for a while , and we felt slightly bewildered . During a break , Ms. Timpanelli  --  she has one of those lovely , expressive voices perfect for telling stories about ugly creatures  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Man mostly as a literary and iconographic figure , the central actor in a genre dating from the Middle Ages . " There are hairy creatures after that period , but it 's basically medieval , " she said . She showed us a book that was extremely specific . Though the Wild Man always wore his hair long , the book said , " elbows and knees were often exposed , as though hair could not grow on those areas of flex and wear . " Ms. Timpanelli and Mr. Bly  --  who spend much of the year travelling , separately or together , the folktale-and-poetry circuit , and were , in fact , hound for Grand Rapids that very night  --  told a number of stories as the day wore on , including a short and moving one , originally reported by Laurens van der Post , about a hag who lived beneath an African river . They also showed slides of fierce woodcuts and sculptures of Wild Men , exposed elbows and all . Though the Wild Man is an old idea  --  one that Mr. Bly says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said he thought that it might have applications for those of us around today . " There is a deep misunderstanding that rock stars are Wild Men , " he told us . " If they respected the Wild Man energies , they would not be breaking five-hundred11111,11kRt qwq dollar guitars onstage . A well-made guitar is full of wildness , but they do n't respect that . " We should think of the Wild Man as " an energy in every man , " he told us . " It 's inaccessible , usually , but when , by the use of mythology or poetry , or whatever , we can make it appear , it helps rescue spontaneity lost early in our lives . We need the Wild Man and the Wild Woman not to dominate our civilized side but to moisten it . " And with that in mind we wandered out onto Twelfth Street , where , down at the corner of Sixth , we could see two men engaged in a brawl . ? VOGAEROBICS : Mark Becker , when first we met him , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was about to begin a demonstration session of his new , trademarked exercise system , Yogaerobics , to which we had been invited . This inversion discussion was simply small talk ; still , to illustrate his points , Mr. Becker ( back when he was . rni.p/y a yoga master , he went by the name Dharmamark ) stood on his head . " What can be wrong with a headstand is that there 's a lot of pressure on the head , " he said . " Some swamis say you can do a headstand for half an hour every day and not need to do any other exercises . But I have not found that to be true  --  and at one point I was doing a headstand for forty-five minutes every morning . Those gravity boots are a really good alternative  --  the boots with the hooks on them so you can hang upside down . When they first came out , you could n't get the bars to hang from , so my friends and I would go down to the basketball courts on Columbus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fellow who was losing his hair , so he shaved it all off , thinking that would make it grow in thicker , and now he 's doing a lot of headstands to increase the circulation in his scalp . It seems to be working . Most people who do yoga for a long time get a little scar on the seventh cervical from the shoulderstands  --  you can recognize people like that on the beach . Do n't get me wrong . The idea of putting pressure on the thyroid so that it secretes is great , but shoulderstands are not the only way . One other possibility is wrapping your hands behind the neck and bending your head forward , toward the chest . " When Mr. Becker ( whose dark mane of hair is witness to " Gentlemen , being a superpower is no longer enough . We must become a super-duper power . " ? ? his excellent scalp circulation ) righted himself , we shook his hand . We asked Mr. Becker to explain how he  --  who has instructed Erica Jong and Carol Lynley , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and has recorded a disc ( " Basic Yoga and You " ) that Mademoiselle honored as one of the ten great exercise records of all time  --  came to invent Yogaerobics , which he is introducing this winter in Manhattan . " Well , " he told us as we sat at his feet , legs folded , " one day I went running on the beach with some friends . I 'd been doing two hours of deep breathing , but still that running made my lungs burn and left me tired . And then it hit me ! Yes , yoga is five thousand years old , but it lacks cardiovascular activity . Yoga was developed by guys sitting on tops of mountains . A grape here , a raisin there , and they felt fine . They did n't need much cardiovascular activity . " Yogaerobics , as its name hints , combines yoga with aerobics , that popular form of disco calisthenics which accounts for an ever greater proportion of the sweat exuded by those who seek after fitness . " The yoga stretches you out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contract , and the yoga stretches you again at the end , " Mr. Becker explained . Although Mr. Becker is as flexible of mind as he is of waist , some members of the yoga fraternity have risen from the lotus position to complain about his innovation . ( People booed when Bob Dylan plugged in his guitar , too . ) " I 've just come back from a meditation camp in the Bahamas where I teach every year , " Mr. Becker said . " The main swamis were n't so sure about Yogaerobics  --  the music is a little loud , among other things . But one day they were n't around , and I got to teach this new stuff , and the guests loved it . And the young swami at the camp  --  he understands that Michael Jackson is one of the highest beings on the planet . " With a deep sense of foreboding ( aroused when we noticed that our classmates For the demonstration were mostly lithe young women in body stockings ) , we stripped down to a pair of gym @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very easy : Mr. Becker told us all to lie on our backs , breathe deeply , and listen to the gentle , meditative music . For the next hour and twenty minutes , the music got steadily faster and the exercise progressively more painful : there was the toe-touching , and then the sunrise salutation , and then the flashdancing , and then the neck isolations , and then the cobra posture , and a lot else , too . That our classmates exhibited the bodily malleability of drunken Gumbys made matters no easier . Nor did Mr. Becker when , trying to he helpful , he offered remarks like " When something really burns , be glad ! " or " The hotter it is , the better it is " or " O.K. ? relax with your knees to your chest . " We relax a lot of ways , but that is not one . When it was over , we got to chant " Om " for a while and then lie down again and talk with two of the young women , both of whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
