The case is an appeal by the state on behalf of the Grand Rapids school district . The district ' s program , under which public school teachers teach remedial and enrichment courses on a regular basis in the parochial schools , " shared time , " was declared unconstitutional by two lower Federal courts. // Under the program , the district leases classrooms in some 40 parochial schools . Religious articles are removed from the classrooms while the " public school " classes are in progress . The 11 , 000 students who attend the classes are designated " part- time public school students , " and they count as part of the public school district ' s enrollment for purposes of state financial aid. // // // Challenge by Taxpayers ' Group // The program was challenged by a group of Grand Rapids taxpayers . The Federal District Court in Michigan ruled that the program was a direct benefit to religious education that violated the Constitution ' s prohibition against the establishment of religion . Upholding the district court , the United States Court of Appeals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ church and state would be effectively ended in the field of public education " if such an arrangement were regarded as constitutional. // In its Supreme Court appeal , Michigan argued that the program met the district ' s obligation to " reach out to all students in the community. " // The case , Grand Rapids v. Ball ( No. 83-990 ) , will be closely watched for signs of shifts in the Supreme Court ' s thinking on the parochial aid issue . Votes in similar cases in the last few years have been close . Last year , the Court upheld , by a vote of 5 to 4 , a Minnesota program of state tax deductions for school expenses that benefitted parochial school parents almost exclusively . In the Grand Rapids case , the court of appeals acknowledged that ruling but distinguished it on the ground that while the Minnesota benefit was at least theoretically available to all parents , the Grand Rapids program was entirely for the benefit of the religious schools. // The Court also dealt with these matters : // Agent Orange // The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defoliant known as Agent Orange to block a trial scheduled to begin May 7 in Federal District Court in Brooklyn. // The five manufacturers are defendants in a large-scale lawsuit brought by Vietnam veterans who charge that their exposure to the chemical during the war caused a variety of physical ailments in themselves and their offspring. // The manufacturers were appealing Judge Jack B. Weinstein ' s definition of the plaintiff class , which could eventually number well over 1 million . Judge Weinstein ruled in December that anyone who served in Vietnam from 1961 through 1972 in the armed forces of the United States , Australia or New Zealand and who was injured by exposure to Agent Orange or other herbicides was eligible to join the lawsuit . He also extended eligibility to spouses , parents and children who were " derivatively " injured. // The five defendants are the Diamond Shamrock Chemicals Company , the Dow Chemical Company , Hercules Inc. , the Monsanto Company , and the T. H. Agriculture and Nutrition Company . In Diamond Shamrock v. Ryan ( No. 83-1174 ) , they argued that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different states and countries and did not have " common claims . " They also argued that Judge Weinstein erred in not requiring the plaintiffs to do everything possible to notify individually all the veterans who might be eligible . The judge permitted notice through public service announcements , governors ' offices , and other relatively inexpensive techniques. // Aging Pilots // The Court agreed to decide whether Trans World Airlines violated the Age Discrimination in Employment Act by refusing to permit 60-year-old pilots to transfer to a different job. // Under Federal Aviation Administration rules , commercial pilots must stop flying at age 60 . Flight engineers , who occupy the third seat in the cockpit , do not come under that rule . T.W.A. permits pilots to transfer to the flight engineer ' s job if they do so before age 60 , but requires 60-year-old pilots to retire if they have not made the switch. // A group of pilots , supported by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission , sued both the airline and their union , the Air Line Pilots Association , on the ground that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age 70 . They won in the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit , which ordered the airline to pay double back wages on the basis of its " willful " violation of the pilots ' rights. // The airline ' s appeal , T.W.A. v. Thurston ( No. 83-997 ) , challenges both the finding of the violation and the court ' s refusal to assess the union for back pay. // Ukrainian Boy // The Court refused to step into the long-running case of Walter Polovchak , the Ukrainian boy who ran away from home rather than go back to the Soviet Union with his parents . The parents had immigrated to Chicago but decided , when Walter was 12 years old , to return to the Ukraine. // The Illinois juvenile court system assumed control over Walter as a " minor in need of supervision , " an action that was found by the state ' s appellate courts to have been improper . Last May , the Illinois Supreme Court ruled that Walter , now 16 years old , was to be returned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // Both the state and the boy , through his lawyers , filed Supreme Court appeals from that ruling ( In re Polovchak , No. 83-845 ) . Both argued that Walter ' s constitutional right to due process was violated by the court ' s continuing supervision of him . It would be a " permanent blot on the record of this country ' s judicial system , " the state ' s appeal said , if the boy were returned to the Soviet Union against his will. // Because it is unlikely that the parents will return to the United States before Walter turns 18 , the age of majority in Illinois , the latest legal developments may have little practical effect . The Carter Administration granted the boy political asylum , and the Reagan Administration gave him permanent resident status. // Welfare Payments // The Court agreed to hear an appeal by the Federal Government from a decision of the Federal appeals court in California on the calculation of benefits under the Aid to Families with Dependent Children program. // Under Federal law , the amount of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ income with a " standard of need " as set by each state . The question in Heckler v. Turner ( No. 83-1097 ) is whether money withheld for taxes is to be considered part of the family ' s income in calculating the welfare grant. // The court of appeals ruled that the withheld money should not be counted because it is not available to the family and because counting it as income would discourage people on welfare from seeking work. // In its appeal , the Government told the Supreme Court that despite the apparent effect of counting withholding as income that was the intent of Congress when it tightened welfare eligibility in the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981 . Congress was aware , the Government said , that the new law would permit a welfare family to retain only about 20 percent of its earned income , compared to the previous 50 percent , but chose nonetheless to enact the new standard. // //
