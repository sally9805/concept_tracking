Not for nothing did Ted Turner earn the nickname Captain Courageous in his sailing days . As skipper of the yacht Courageous , which won the 1977 America 's Cup , he had a knack for snatching victory from sure defeat . In the equally competitive and treacherous world of business , the cable-TV king showed his spunk and resilience once again last week . Just as Turner admitted that his quixotic attempt to take over CBS had capsized , he announced two bold new ventures for the burgeoning Turner Broadcasting System ( TBS ) . The Atlanta-based company ( 1984 revenues : $282 million ) will buy the venerable MGM/UA company for $1.5 billion and become a partner with the Soviet Union in staging and televising an international sports extravaganza called the Goodwill Games . <P> Unlike CBS , which fought off Turner , financially strapped MGM/UA welcomed his offer , which amounted to $29 a share for the diversified entertainment firm . As a condition of the sale , TBS will immediately recoup about a third of the purchase price by spinning off United Artists for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Financier Kirk Kerkorian , who owns 50.1% of MGM/UA 's stock . The slimmed-down United Artists will have few assets other than its film library . In contrast , MGM will retain its extensive film and TV production and distribution operations , including the 24 sound stages on its 44-acre Culver City lot and an impressive library of 2,200 films ( including Gone With the Wind , The Wizard of Oz , Singin ' in the Rain and 2001 : A Space Odyssey ) . <P> Soon after the MGM news broke , Turner arranged simultaneous press conferences in New York City , Moscow , London and Phoenix , which were broadcast live on his SuperStation WTBS , to announce a groundbreaking agreement with the Soviet Union . As Turner grinned at reporters at New York 's Waldorf-Astoria Hotel , TBS Executive Vice President Robert Wussler clasped hands with Soviet sports officials in Moscow . Turner said that TBS and the Soviets would co-produce and broadcast the Goodwill Games from Moscow next July . The games are expected to draw top athletes from around the world for 160 events , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if they are successful . In 1990 they would be in the U.S. TBS will provide equipment and transportation to Moscow for the American athletes , while the U.S.S.R. will pick up expenses for most of the other athletes . TBS and the Soviets will split the profits .
