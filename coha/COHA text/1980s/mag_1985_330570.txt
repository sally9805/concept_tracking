Consider the cast of characters : 1 ) a trusted secretary seduced 17 years ago by an East German agent whom she has served faithfully ever since as a spy in the West German President 's office , 2 ) a senior counterespionage official who thwarts a kidnaping attempt in Austria by a friend he met in a Cologne sauna , 3 ) a mysterious woman who places an obituary notice in the London Times for three people who never existed . <P> That tangled web of espionage might have made for amusing reading had it emerged from the pages of a spy novel . Instead it leaped from the headlines of West German newspapers last week , as the country 's most serious spy scandal in more than a decade grew even wider . Chancellor Helmut Kohl found the revelations anything but amusing . In an effort to limit the damage , Kohl last week dismissed Heribert Hellenbroich , 48 , chief of the Federal Intelligence Service . <P> Until he took over the service last month , Hellenbroich had been in charge of the Office for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's counterespionage agency . As such , he was the boss of Hans Joachim Tiedge , 48 , head of the agency 's East Germany section , who defected to that country two weeks ago . Despite complaints from co-workers that Tiedge was a security risk because of his heavy drinking and mounting debts , Hellenbroich had refused to move or suspend him , an action that Kohl called " totally incomprehensible . " Even so , Hellenbroich insisted that he had not made a mistake . " I 'd do it again , " he said after his dismissal . <P> Hellenbroich was replaced by Hans-Georg Wieck , 57 , an experienced diplomat who has served since 1980 as West German ambassador to NATO . Wieck is highly respected in Western capitals , and his appointment was seen as an attempt by the Kohl government to regain the confidence of its Atlantic allies . Investigators have not yet determined whether Tiedge , who joined the OPC in 1966 , had been working for the East Germans all along or had gone over to the other side only recently . Whatever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a position to know the identities of East Germans and possibly others in the East bloc working for West Germany . Indeed , the repercussions were already being felt . Apparently fearing exposure by Tiedge , an East German diplomat , Martin Winkler , 44 , who had been posted in Buenos Aires and was probably working as a double agent , defected to West Germany last week . <P> The day after Tiedge turned up in East Germany , West German authorities arrested Margarete Hoke , 50 , a secretary for the past 21 years in the office of the Federal President , on suspicion of spying for East Germany . Officials said that Hoke had first met an East German agent named Franz Becker in 1968 and had recently been spotted making contact with him in Copenhagen . A few days after Hoke was picked up , Swiss authorities in Lucerne arrested an East German couple , Johann and Ingeborg Hubner , who were believed to be linked to Hoke.                   @ @
