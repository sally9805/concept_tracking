The Flying Vazquezes achieve an astounding four flip-flops <P> Even when their outstretched hands connected , Miguel and Juan Vazquez were not quite sure they had done it . " I did n't believe it , " says Juan . " And I asked myself , ' Did I catch him ? ' " Miguel , his younger brother , was also uncertain . Says he : " It all happened so fast that only when I looked down and saw the floor did I know that we had done the trick . " Actually , what the Flying Vazquezes accomplished together on July 10 in Tucson was much more than a trick . It was an athletic feat equivalent to the breaking of the 4-min. mile : the first quadruple somersault performed before a regular circus audience . <P> The brothers had managed the nearly impossible stunt ten times in practice sessions over the past year , and they had tried doing it at every performance since Dec. 29 , when the Ringling Bros , and Barnum &; Bailey Circus opened its 112th season . Charley Baumann @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fail so many times that he too was stunned when they finally succeeded . He ran to the phone and called the show 's producers , Irvin and Kenneth Feld , in Washington . " They asked me why the hell I was calling after midnight , " he told TIME 's Paul Krueger . " And all I could say was , ' They caught the quad ! They caught the quad ! ' " <P> Acrobats have been trying to catch the quad since 1897 , when , according to many accounts , European Aerialist Lena Jordan first did the triple somersault . The triple is now performed regularly , but it is still an accomplishment reserved for the very best aerialists . Yet Miguel , 17 , who represents the fifth generation of a family of Mexican circus performers , was able to do the triple when he was 13 . He spun so fast and flew so high that he was urged to go for four . <P> But there is more to a quad than another flipflop . When a flyer is traveling through the air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seconds . " If it 's a triple somersault , Mi guel can feel if he 's going too fast , " explains Juan , 32 . " He can relax and slow down . If he 's going too slowly , he can tuck up tighter and complete the third somer sault faster . " The quadruple , by contrast , allows no such mid-course adjustment ; once the flyer has released the bar and tucked himself up for the first of four turns , he is spinning too fast to correct himself . The burden of timing rests with the catcher . If any changes are to be made , he must make them , matching his swing to the human projectile hurtling toward him .
