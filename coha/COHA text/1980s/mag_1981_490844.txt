THE TALK OF THE TOWN Notes and Comment HEN the American hostages W were released from Iran , the headlines sang out " FREE-DOM . " In the days that followed , the full meaning of that word , so often used and misused in the political oratory of our country , was given life in hours of television news coverage . Over the months , we had all seen the strange , stilted , stiff , wary figures of the hos-tages in Iranian film clips released for propaganda purposes . Now we saw fifty-two lively , cheerful , uncon-strained  --  free  --  men and women ( with the men wearing long hair and beards , it looked as though a small crowd of hippies had been sprung on the world ) streaming across the run-way in Algeria . And in the tearful , joyful faces of the families and friends in the United States , too , we could read the meaning of freedom . Then , as the country learned of the isolation cells , the beatings , and the mock executions , still another dimension @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forty-four days , the hos-tages had joined the world 's huge population of political prisoners . We had often read in the newspapers about whole countries  --  Czechoslovakia , Chile , the Philippines , Cambodia ? losing their freedom , but those events had often seemed remote and dim , and American reaction had been lethargic . The reaction was much sharper when the faces behind the bars of a foreign prison were American . Freedom by another name is human rights , and it was one of the accomplishments of the Carter Administration to shine the spotlight of world attention  --  however fitfully and inconsistently  --  into the gloom of sonic of the world 's most barbarous political prisons . Recently , there have been suggestions that the new Administration might weaken , or even abandon , the policy introduced by President Carter . The hostage crisis will have served at least one good purpose if it strengthens the country 's and the new Administration 's conviction  --  a natural one for a free people  --  that arbitrary confinement , torture , and execution ( mock or real ) are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world . THE day before the hostages were released and Ronald Reagan was sworn into office , Iran 's Executive Affairs Minister , Behzad Nabavi , proclaimed , in the sort of wildly abusive language we have come to expect from Iranian officials , that Iran had " managed to rub in the dirt the nose of the world 's biggest oppressor and superpower " ? namely , the United States . It is important for the future that Americans understand that no such thing has happened . The only noses that have been lowered into any dirt  --  the dirt of pointless cruelty and criminality  --  are those of the officials of the Iranian government , and their noses were lowered there by the officials themselves . To be sure , in human terms the imprisonment of the hostages was a small offense compared to the repression  --  including the many executions without trials  --  that the Iranian government visited on its own people ; but internationally the cost of the hostage crisis to Iran was disproportionately high . The Iranians wanted the world to know how brutal the Americanbacked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unquestionably had been brutal  --  but now , thanks in large part to the hostage issue , the world has also had its attention drawn to the brutality of the Khomeini regime . The Iranians tried to publicize brutality with a brutal expedient , and ended up being viewed  --  correctly  --  as brutal themselves . But when Mr. Nabavi spoke of rubbing our nose in the dirt he was referring not to the humiliation of being seen by the world to have participated in crimes but to another , cruder sort of humiliation : that of suffering an outrage without finding an effective way of striking back . This is a sort of humiliation  --  if humiliation is what it is  --  that many people in the United States have indeed felt in connection with the hostage crisis . By a historical coincidence , the Iranian government 's desire arising from violent revolutionary fervor , burning nationalism , and religious extremism , all fused into an incandescent fanaticism  --  to at least appear in the eyes of their own people to be humiliating the United States corresponded with a moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the extent of its influence in world affairs . The United States may or may not be losing strength in the world , but , in supposing that the fact that American hostages could be taken proved that America was weak , Iranians and Americans , for their different reasons , shared in a fateful mistake . The error seems to have stemmed from a misunderstanding , on both sides , of the nature of kidnapping . The power to kidnap is not a measure of strength , nor is vulnerability to kidnapping a measure of weakness . Any nation  --  or , if it comes to that , any terrorist group , or even any individual  --  has the power to kidnap defenseless citizens of another country , no matter how mighty . ( And diplomats , no matter what efforts might be made to protect them , will always be essentially defenseless when they are on foreign soil . ) If a strong nation is defeated on the field of battle by a weak nation , then it has perhaps been humiliated , in the sense that its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if diplomats are seized there is no reflection on strength , because no test of strength has occurred . Has anyone ever supposed  --  before , during , or since the hostage crisis  --  that in a military contest between the United States and Iran the United States would lose ? The difference between a kidnapping and a test of strength is important to keep in mind , because if the United States confuses the two , and defines the kidnapping of our citizens as a sign of weakness on our part , then whenever any such kidnapping occurs the United States will , by its own yardstick , appear weak . Furthermore , a policy that overestimates the strategic meaning of kidnapping may invite the very thing it seeks to deter . Very often , governments or terrorist organizations that are themselves too weak to get what they want through either persuasion or force will try to get it through publicity instead . American overreaction to a kidnapping could give them just the kind of publicity they seek . And , finally , if it is proved once again that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except at the risk of their lives , then the appearance of weakness will grow , as it did during the Iranian affair . Far better , it seems , would be for us to publicly acknowledge the danger of being kidnapped for what it really is  --  an irremediable vulnerability of all unprotected human beings  --  and to look for our national strength where it can actually be found : in our abundant military , economic , and spiritual resources . ? ? The Christian T radition JAROSLAV PELIKAN has the features of a steel mill 's shop steward  --  thick , blunt fingers ; square , furrowed face ; white hair with an irrepressible tuft  --  which he is not . In tweeds , vest , and after-ski boots , he dresses another part  --  one he has performed with zest since he heeded the call of his Czechoslovakian Lutheran heritage and committed himself to scholarship and teaching . Now Sterling Professor of History at Yale , Pelikan teaches both basic and esoteric courses related to his life 's preoccupation , which is also the subject of his five-volume @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A History of the Development of Doctrine , " and consisting of three volumes to date , the opus has already been saluted as " a masterpiece of exposiFEBIA.UARY 2,1981 tion " ( New York Review of Books ) , " monumental in its comprehensiveness , meticulous in its judicious scholarship " ( Library Journal ) , and " an indispensable resource not only for the history of doctrine but also for its reformulation today " ( Christian Century ) . Recently , we stopped in at Pelikan 's university office in New Haven to talk with him about his ongoing project . He greeted us briskly , settled down in a rocking chair , and , in a robust voice that rolled with assurance , told us , " Robert Hutchins used to say that scholars are like a work crew that comes to State and Madison in Chicago at four o'clock in the afternoon with pneumatic drills and jackhammers . The workers are tearing up the pavement , and passersby ask , ' Why the hell are you digging here ? ' They answer , ' Because nobody 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one can try to take on an entire period , with the smell of the streets and the taste of the food , the art and the women , and the whole bit , or one can concentrate on a particular theme and carry it over a number of periods  --  dig at State and Madison , so to speak . The latter way  --  showing how the major teachings of Christianity have evolved , for example  --  is a discipline that began at the end of the eighteenth century , as much historical study did . But the last comprehensive effort to do what I 'm doing was carried out by the generation that died around 1930 . The next generation would have done it again but did n't , because of the Hitler time and the war . " It 's difficult for Americans to do what I do , partly because they do n't have the kind of intense , early humanistic education that is required . You have to have languages under your belt very early , so you do n't spend the creative part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in effect , a German Gymnasium in Indiana , where we started Latin and German and Greek in our high-school years and started Hebrew in our first college year . I learned Syriac as a consequence of learning Hebrew , and by the time I was eighteen I had these languages and , thanks to the advantage of coming from a Slavic home , had the Slavic languages as well . I always knew I was going to be a scholar , and I early began to wonder if I had the obligation and the opportunity to do this task  --  comprehensive church history  --  again . " Even in my student days , I began THE NEW YORKER to play with the idea from the perspective of a different time  --  under the influence of various intellectual and ecclesiastical trends like the ecumenical movement , which brought about an unprecedented degree of sympathetic understanding among different churches . I drew up an outline of this work in 1945 , when I was a graduate student , and I wrote a hundred-page precis in 1950 , when I finished my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Louis . For thirty years , I have had this thing in my mind , and a kind of built-in filing system for it . When I 've given lectures , or done research for papers , books , or lectures , or directed dissertations  --  done any of the things a scholar does  --  I 've always had metaphorical boxes to put information in . I 've written entire books on subjects that the hig work covers in less than a paragraph . I wish I could pause longer over some issues . On the other hand , since the matter of continuity and how tradition is handled is a decisive element in historical evolution , relating one aspect of a period to the same aspect of another period is , to me , extremely important . " Pelikan shifted in his rocking chair , waved a pen , and continued , " My interest , because it extends across periods and across a variety of themes , is in how the tradition received is reinterpreted and applied . It is really the relationship between continuity and change . Here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Supreme Court , like the church , is committed to an ancient written authority , which it proceeds to interpret . Thus it is a source of enormous continuity  --  the Justices talk about Justice Marshall as if he were in the next room  --  but is also a source of social change and innovation . I 'm interested in charting a similar tension in the Christian tradition , as it has been carried out over a span of almost two thousand years . There is really no institution in Western culture besides the church where we have this kind of laboratory , on this scale , for the study of change and continuity . If I have a motto or slogan , it comes from Goethe 's ' Faust ' : ' What you have received as an inheritance from your fathers , you must possess again in order to make it your own . ' I 'm interested in how that has been done in the Christian tradition . " " The Growth of Medieval Theology , " the third volume of Pelikan 's work , begins with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " On the Breaking of the Lord 's Body " ( " De Fractione Corporis Domini " ) , to Zeno of Verona , " Tractate " ? revealing the author 's depth and breadth of research . Pelikan has written fifteen other books ( " Fools for Christ , " " The Riddle of Roman Catholicism , " and " Obedient Rebels " among them ) , and they show another side of him  --  clever , good-humored , and popularly pitched . He prizes the few graduate students who are able to follow in his footsteps . ( " We work to clone ourselves , " he says . " That 's what professors do . ' Let us make students after our own image , ' it says somewhere in. the Bible ; that 's a textual variant , not in the best manuscripts . " ) Yet he also relishes teaching freshmen and sophomores in Yale 's introductory course in Western Civilization , known on campus as " Plato to NATO , " and praises their best papers as " wise and knowing , with the right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 's happiest working at his own swift pace in a library , he lectures about twelve times a year , at seminaries , institutes , and universities around the world , and he keeps a finger in many intellectual pies by sitting on academic , editorial , and library boards . We asked him why he takes time from scholarship to ride circuit and popularize history . " Unless the task is occasionally undertaken by those of us who are primarily full-time scholars , it will be undertaken by those who are not , " he answered . " We have no right to complain if the middle rank of writings on these topics proceeds uninformed by scholarly judgments . I early recognized in myself not only scholarly gifts but a kind of articulateness . A teacher of mine said I could be wrong in more languages than anyone else he knew . I 've always had great admiration for the mother tongue  --  though it 's not really my mother tongue  --  and have tried to be responsible and clear in it . Unless scholars like me help students @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hack somewhere will do so on the basis of what a mere six or seven scholars have done . I think it 's important that students and others be taken gently by the hand , or not so gently , and led through history by scholars who live there . " Pelikan 's paternal grandfather was Bishop of the Slovak Lutheran Church in this country ; his father was a Lutheran minister . Yale 's Pelikan chose the academy as his setting because he thought the church a difficult place to retain " one 's scholarly integrity " and because he wanted to work where the history he studied for its own sake would be valued on those terms . To Pelikan , the church seems to suffer from amnesia and myopia ; to the church , much of what he studies seems , he says , " between ho and hum . " In Pelikan 's mind , the academy is the one place where the calling is " to know . " Since he makes no secret of his skepticism about the church , we said we wondered how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pause for assessment , he replied , " After all , the university is not exactly the Kingdom of God , either . One has to live with the ambiguities of any institution , accept them , change them , but not become so preoccupied with them that one ca n't get on with the business at hand . I have a great many friends who are active in various churches , and to them I represent  --  because 1 do have my own commitments , and have no compunctions about disclosing them  --  proof that you can believe what the church believes and keep your intellectual integrity . If you want to get personal about it , one of my problems in the contemporary situation is that I 've never had any serious doubts about the basic rightness of the Christian faith . " Twenty years ago , Pelikan wrote that Christianity is as incapable of logical definition " as the taste of cheddar cheese or the music in the closing scene of Don Giovanni . " We asked how he would describe it , if not define it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like lapidary formulas , but I 've read too much Chesterton , and therefore I keep coming up with them . How would I de scribe Christianity today ? That the particular in the person of Jesus Christ is the universal  --  that what stands at the center of his message is at the center of the universe . The only way to the universal is through the particular , and you ca n't stop at the particular , because you know it to be the way of access to the universal . I love my wife for what she is , but the love by which I love her and by which she loves me is the love that , Dante says at the end of the ' Comedy , ' moves the sun and all the other stars and is the heart of God . You ca n't have just a general kind of love that refuses to get itself dirty with individuals . There 's got to be a particularity . I think that for a Christian that particularity is the life , death , and resurrection of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a window , and you look through it , not at it . That 's why it 's clear glass , not stained glass . " Since the Polish situation provides another kind of particular for contemporary Christians , with the Pope guiding the workers in one way or another , we asked Pelikan if he would comment on that situation . Pelikan laughed . " To have the visible head of Western Christendom a Slav  --  wow ! " he said . " As an East European , as a man who has a deep affinity with his culture , this is a man who pays attention to the political situation . Remember Stalin asking how many battalions the Pope had ? Now the Russians know . What would Kosygin  --  may he rest in peace  --  or Brezhnev or any of those guys give to go into an East European country and have a million people spontaneously turn out to cheer ? It must blow their minds . About the Polish situation , I have no inside dope . I keep a shortwave radio next to my bed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week and to Radio Moscow almost every night  --  partly to hear the languages . I know that the real question is how far to push the resistance . I know that there are people who think that Russian occupation would be better than a pretense of a Polish government . I know that the Pope wants FEDRUARY 2,1981 moderation . And I know something else : whatever the Russians do will be wrong . If they go in , it will be wrong . If they do n't , it will be wrong . Whatever they do , they 're going to lose , and I must say that the fact does not fill me with sorrow .

Idea THE other day , Robert Sparks gave a demonstration of an invention he has recently patented  --  the portable upright-sleeping device . This took place in his apartment , on East Fourteenth Street , near Union Square , where Mr. Sparks has no trouble making himself comfortable . He sat in a straight-backed chair with the prototype of the upright-sleeping device in his lap . The prototype was a Styrofoam box with a contoured base that fitted over his thighs . The top of the box almost reached Mr. Sparks ' chin . He leaned on the top of the box , making a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pillow . He closed his eyes and became very still , and created the impression that he was napping . The upright-sleeping device appeared to work fine . After about a minute , Mr. Sparks stretched his arms and yawned . " If you were on a long bus ride  --  I 've taken some long bus rides  --  you THE NEW YORKER might want to store your valuables or some fresh food inside while you slept , " said Mr. Sparks , removing the top of the box and revealing that it was hollow . lie replaced the lid . " If you fell asleep in the waiting room of a hospital and you had this , your head would n't be rolling all over the place . This will make people more sociable . You can invite a friend over to spend the night even if you do n't have an extra bed . Your friend can stay in your bed and you can sleep in a chair with one of these . " Mr. Sparks stood up and brushed away some Styrofoam crumbs that clung to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yellow dots . Underneath , he wore a blue plaid flannel shirt and a blue necktie with white dots . Mr. Sparks is a man in his early fifties who is modest by nature , except when he talks at length about the potential of the upright-sleeping device . In moments of high enthusiasm , he compares the upright-sleeping device to the wheel and the incandescent light bulb . When his attitude becomes more sober , he points out , accurately , that the upright-sleeping device shows greater promise than the self-wringing mop he thought up in 1948 , in Chicago . The problem with the self-wringing mop , Mr. Sparks now believes , was that not everyone needed a mop , and most people who did already had one . Some of Mr. Sparks ' other creations are the **25;6395;TOOLONG drawing board ; a contemporary chessboard with built-in ashtrays and coasters ( more a design achievement than an actual invention ) ; and a perpetual calendar based upon the Book of Revelation . A couple of years ago , Mr. Sparks left his job as a statistical typist , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Although he agrees that inventing is hard work , he believes that success depends a great deal upon inspiration . Music inspires him . A grand piano stands in one room of the apartment , near a bright-colored oil portrait of a clown . Much of Mr. Sparks ' time has been devoted to generating an atmosphere in his apartment which might be conducive to inventing He owns a pool table , some cafe booths and tables , curtains of hanging glass beads , a bust of George Washington , and dozens of artificial plants . Mr. Sparks mentioned that he prefers artificial plants to real ones , " because I 'm sort of a plant murderer . " A potted tree that died some time ago stands near the front door . The leaves that have not fallen off have been spray painted a bright green . They match a small grove of artificial Christmas trees which stands in one corner , near the contemporary-chessboard prototype . " Those Christmas trees are like a broken clock , " said Mr. Sparks . " Once a year , they 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cord happens to be mounted not far from the Christmas trees . The clock , which is accurate whenever the time is five minutes past eleven , hangs on the outside of a wall surrounding Mr. Sparks ' swimming pool . The pool is circular , about term feet in diameter , lined with plastic , and bordered by siding material that makes it remarkably inconspicuous . It is deep enough to hold four feet of water , but Mr. Sparks said that when he uses it he puts in much less . " I get by with eighteen inches , " he said . " Eighteen inches lets you float around and still have a nice time . " Mr. Sparks called the swimming pool his " think tank , " but that is not really where he does his inventing . Most of his invention ideas come to him while he is asleep . He was sleeping in a bed but envisioning an uncomfortable bus ride when the details of the portable upright-sleeping device manifested themselves to him . The engineering drawings that accompany Mr. Sparks ' patent for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ model , for which no prototype exists , would include a chin rest and pouches that the hands could fit inside , as in a fur muff . Mr. Sparks said that he looks forward to test-sleeping this . The final design will depend upon some marketing considerations that he has not yet worked out . " I 'll get to them soon , " he said . " Or else they 'll come to me . In a dream , I imagine . "
