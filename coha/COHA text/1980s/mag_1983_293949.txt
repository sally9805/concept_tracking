In a week of rosy economic news , Feldstein ' s warnings rouse ire <P> For the nation , the economic news last week was all good . Unemployment was down sharply in November , to 8.4% ; the Dow Jones industrial average hit an alltime high . Around the country , retailers reported booming Christmas sales , and the leading economic indicators were up for the 14th consecutive month , the longest sustained recovery since 1975-76 ( see ECONOMY &; BUSINESS ) . <P> But at the White House , the upbeat mood was marred by some nagging warnings from an in-house Cassandra . For weeks , Martin Feldstein , chairman of the President 's Council of Economic Advisers , has been cautioning that unless taxes are raised to cut the nearly $200 billion deficit projected for fiscal year 1984 , the good economic news will turn sour . Moreover , Feldstein has been sounding off in public . Irked , the President 's senior advisers tried to muzzle him last week with a public reprimand , which then degenerated into gratuitous ridicule . Their heavyhandedness succeeded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The White House , once worried that the recovery would run out of steam by mid-1984 , is now confident that it will last at least long enough to get Ronald Reagan reelected . " The economy is coming up roses right now , " chortled a Reagan aide . " Eighty-four is safe , and most think that ' 85 will be safe . As the good times move forward , there is less and less fear of the bubble breaking , at least before November . " In fact , the President 's political strategists are eager to make an issue of the economy . <P> The good news strengthens the hand of Feldstein 's chief rival for the President 's ear on economic matters , Treasury Secretary Donald Regan . " The President thinks Don Regan 's advice is better . Don not only tells the President what he likes to hear , but it turns out he was right , " says an aide . What Regan tells Reagan is that the President can cut taxes , increase military spending and still have a sustained economic recovery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drastically underestimated the strength of the recovery , earning himself the nickname " Dr. Gloom . " More recently Regan has been battling with Feldstein over the deficit . The CEA chairman argues that excessive deficits will drive interest rates high enough to choke off the boom . Regan insists that there is no hard proof of this . Even if the deficit persists , he argues , the White House can afford to wait until 1985 to reduce it . <P> As Feldstein sees it , the White House must act quickly-in the 1985 budget that it will present in January-to reassure the financial markets . Already the markets are betting that high interest rates will soon push inflation , now running at less than 5% , toward double digits . For the short term , however , most Wall Street analysts are more bullish than Feldstein . If anything , consumers are more confident . Retail sales are running 20% over last year at some stores . Says Richard Thomas , president of First Chicago Corp. : " When people are not worried about losing their jobs , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
