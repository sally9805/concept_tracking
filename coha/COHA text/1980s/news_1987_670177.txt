And the Lord said unto Moses , Go on before the people , and take with thee of the elders of Israel ; and thy rod , wherewith thou smotest the river , take in thine hand , and go.  --  Exodus 17 : 5 And the Lord spake unto Moses , saying , Take the rod , and gather thou the assembly together , thou , and Aaron thy brother , and speak ye unto the rock before their eyes ; and it shall give forth his water , and thou shalt bring forth to them water out of the rock : so thou shalt give the congregation and their beasts drink.  --  Numbers 20 : 7-8 The first five books of the Bible  --  the Pentateuch , or Torah  --  have a puzzling tendency to tell the same story twice , but never in quite the same way . These twice-told tales have long provided the main impetus for a controversial theory about the authorship of the Bible . Now , a 41-year-old linguist and biblical scholar at the University of California at San Diego , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Prof. Friedman has written a book called " Who Wrote the Bible ? " It hasn ' t been challenging " Spycatcher " on the nonfiction best-seller lists , but it hasn ' t been doing badly and it promises to stir up even more of a fuss . The book explores the origins of such stories as that of Moses striking the rock to bring forth water for the desert-wandering Israelites . In Exodus , Moses simply strikes the rock " in the sight of the elders of Israel , " and not much more is made of the miracle . The same story is told again in Numbers , but in this case it is clear that Aaron is an active participant . Moreover , in the Numbers version the miracle provides a setting for an angry God to tell Moses he won ' t live to lead the Israelites into the Promised Land , an incident not mentioned in Exodus . Such twice-told stories in the first five books of the Bible  --  known as the Books of Moses : Genesis , Exodus , Leviticus , Numbers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ documentary hypothesis " of the Bible . This theory states that contrary to the traditional belief still held by Orthodox Jews and Protestant fundamentalists , the Books of Moses weren ' t written by Moses . Instead , the theory goes , they consist of several ancient texts , or documents , written , edited and rewritten at different times by various individuals with assorted motives . Scholars of the documentary school hold , for example , that the Numbers version of the water-from-the-rock miracle is a rewrite of the Exodus story by ancient priests who claimed descent from Aaron and wanted to elevate his status and downgrade that of Moses . Controversy has surrounded the documentary theory ever since it was formalized more than 150 years ago . But until a few months ago , the debate had been confined largely to journals of biblical scholarship , seminary lectures and divinity-school classrooms . Now the theory  --  like creation-vs. - evolution and the fight over " secular humanism "  --  is entering the public arena . That ' s because of Mr. Friedman ' s book , which has gone into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprising even its publisher , Summit Books of New York . Mr. Friedman , writing in a detective-story style , tracks his efforts and those of other scholars to determine the authors of the Books of Moses . He goes so far as to name two of the authors , evoking criticism even from some of his academic peers who agree that Moses didn ' t write the books but doubt that any individual author or authors can be pinpointed . But the most fervent criticism of Mr. Friedman ' s book will doubtless come from those who believe that Moses wrote the Pentateuch . " I think it ' s quite likely the book will bring a new attack from both Orthodox Jews and the new Protestant fundamentalists , " says Frank Moore Cross , professor of Hebrew and Oriental languages at Harvard University and Mr. Friedman ' s former mentor . Already Mr. Friedman ' s work has been attacked by Carl S.H. Henry , an evangelical theologian who calls it " all highly speculative . " Despite decades of study , he says , no one has found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scroll , for example , or inscription  --  that supports the documentary theory . Adds Jon D. Levenson , associate professor of the divinity school at the University of Chicago : " People like Jerry Falwell and those to the right of him are going to find the book offensive . " A Falwell aide replies , " I don ' t know if Dr. Falwell has seen the book yet , but I do know this : There ' s been nothing presented to us that would make us think that the Books of Moses were written by anyone but Moses . " The aide , Don Norman , associate pastor of Mr. Falwell ' s evangelical television program , the " Old Time Gospel Hour " in Lynchburg , Va. , declares , " If this is another example of secular humanism , we ' ll fight it because we ' re totally against secular humanism . " Mr. Friedman was content to publish his research in the scholarly press until about six years ago . Then he found that " people at dinners and cocktail parties seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me that they didn ' t know anything about this field of research . " Encouraged by two friends who wrote popularized versions of scientific theories , Mr. Friedman decided to popularize the documentary theory . Questions about the authorship of the Books of Moses have long stirred dispute . An 11th-century Jewish physician in Spain , Issac ibn Yashush , has gone down in history as " Issac the Blunderer " because no one would accept his seemingly sensible observation that Moses couldn ' t possibly have written down the names of 36 Edomite kings who reigned after his death . As late as the 17th century , philosophers like Spinoza who questioned Moses ' authorship found their writings on the subject banned . In the mid-1800s , Lutheran theologians in Germany decided to explore the question scientifically in an effort to sort out the human and divine contributions . A major discovery of theirs hinged on the twice-told tales , or doublets . They found that these stories could be separated into two versions by the way God is addressed . In one version , known as the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the other , the " E " version of the same stories , God is referred to as Elohim , which means Lord . Mr. Friedman and other scholars believe that the explanation lies in the fact that after the death of Solomon , the Israelite empire split into two competing kingdoms , Israel in the north and Judah in the south . Each , these scholars say , evolved its own priesthood and its own version of the ancient stories , the E version in the northern kingdom  --  where uttering God ' s name was considered sacrilege  --  and the J version in the south . When the Assyrians destroyed Israel in 722 B.C. , refugees who flocked southward into Judah carried the E version with them , the theory goes on , and to avoid a dangerous religious conflict some unknown editor or group of editors threaded the J and E versions together so adroitly that their handiwork went undetected for more than 2 , 500 years . Scholars since have culled at least two other ancient texts from the Books of Moses . One deals largely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called the Priestly , or " P , " text . It consists of Leviticus plus parts of Genesis , Exodus and Numbers . The other text has as its core Deuteronomy and is called the " Dtr. " text . Lastly , there is evidence of the work of a redactor , or editor , a person or persons who , at some point , took various ancient texts and wove them together into the Books of Moses as they exist today . Complicating the scholars ' job is evidence that the authors involved in compiling a text also altered older texts , inserting a verse or sentence here and there . For example , the P text is thought by Mr. Friedman and others to be the work of priests who believed that Aaron was the first high priest and , as such , was the first empowered to make sacrifices . This meant that Noah , who lived long before Aaron , couldn ' t have made sacrifices and had no need for " clean , " or sacrificial , animals . So the Aaronid priests , Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ older J version , eliminating references to " clean " and " unclean " animals , and later someone wove the two versions together . That would explain why the animals brought aboard the ark are described twice ; it wouldn ' t do to simply eliminate one description or the other because both were so familiar to so many people . ( The Aaronid priests also rewrote the water-from-the-rock miracle to give more prominence to Aaron , Mr. Friedman says . ) Mr. Friedman parts with previous scholars on the dating of the P text , and his argument is gaining the respect , if not the agreement , of his academic peers . The key , he says , lies in the nature of the tabernacle , the " tent of the meeting , " which housed the ark containing the laws given Moses . " There are over 500 references to the tabernacle in the P text , " he says . At issue is whether the tabernacle actually existed . The 19th-century German scholars argued that the P text was written by priests sometime after the Second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ German scholars , these priests , writing the stories of the wandering Israelites who couldn ' t have had a permanent temple , more or less invented the tabernacle as a symbol of the temple . Although the P text doesn ' t describe the architecture of the tabernacle , it does give such details as its 48 wooden panels , each 1 1/2 cubits wide . ( A cubit is about 18 to 22 inches . ) Using these data , Mr. Friedman a few years ago worked out a possible architecture for the tabernacle . The trouble was that its dimensions  --  20 cubits long , 8 wide and 10 high  --  weren ' t proportional to either the First Temple ( Solomon ' s Temple , destroyed by the Babylonians ) or the Second Temple  --  and thus seemed to lack any of the expected religious significance . " I puzzled over this for a long time , and then one night when I had trouble sleeping the answer struck me , " he recalls . The dimensions of Solomon ' s Temple are detailed , including the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that guarded the ark in the temple ' s innermost room . His postulated tabernacle , he realized , would fit exactly underneath the outstretched wings of the cherubs . This convinces Mr. Friedman that the tabernacle was a real structure and that it had been placed in Solomon ' s Temple . In that case , he argues , the P text must have been written before the Babylonians destroyed the temple in 587 B.C. , possibly a century before the destruction and as much as 200 years earlier than claimed by the German scholars . This would place the P text in a time when the Aaronid priests were in power . " It ' s a thoroughly defendable position even though I don ' t agree with it , " says Harvard ' s Prof. Cross . Prof. Friedman elicits sharper reactions when he names his candidate for the author of the Deuteronomistic text . The Dtr. text was built around a code of laws discovered in the First Temple one day while Josiah was king , a few years before the Babylonian destruction . Most of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jewish kingdom , but suddenly it takes on tones of despair and uncertainty . The prevailing view is that the Dtr. text was compiled by a " school " of priests . According to this view , the bulk of the text was compiled in the halcyon days of King Josiah but , after the Babylonian destruction , the authors had to make revisions reflecting the disaster and bleak future . But Mr. Friedman argues that Dtr. is the work of a single individual . There is one known biblical writer who lived through both Josiah ' s reign and the Babylonian disaster , he says : Jeremiah , along with his scribe , Baruch son of Neriyah . The Dtr. text in the Books of Moses is written in the same style as the book of Jeremiah , Mr. Friedman says , and the book of Jeremiah is filled with references to the Dtr. text . The other author Mr. Friedman names is Ezra , the Aaronid priest and scribe who returned to Judah from the Babylonian exile carrying a complete copy of the Torah . Reviving another theory proposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ redactor who combined all the ancient texts into the Books of Moses as they are known today . " Ezra , " says Mr. Friedman " was in the right priestly family , in the right profession , in the right place , in the right time , with the authority and the first known copy of the book in his hand . " But this notion of Mr. Friedman ' s also isn ' t widely seconded . The University of Chicago ' s Prof. Levenson is among those who are skeptical about any attempt to name specific authors of the Bible . In his view it is the product of many hands over many years  --  " essentially the work of a committee . " Credit : Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal
