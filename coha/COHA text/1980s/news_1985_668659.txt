" When Southerners tell a story orally , " said T.R. Pearson , " they invariably start in the middle thinking that they ' re starting at the beginning . " Then as soon as they start talking , " he said , " they realize they have left out something , so they have to go way back before they can tell you about now . This means the story has its own impetus , and so it goes forward and it goes backwards , too , and you have a story that goes in two directions at once . " T.R. Pearson , 29 , a Winston-Salem , N.C. , native and the author of " A Short History of a Small Place , " said at his home in Fuquay-Varina , N.C. , that because of his own backwards-and-forwards Southern manuscript he had a hard time with Yankee editors . " They didn ' t understand me , and I didn ' t understand them . They wrote me these puzzling letters , and they ' d talk to me like I was a child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . " Pearson believes Southerners are different from Northerners because Southerners lost the war . " We ' ve fallen , and we know it , " he said . " We ' ve been through so much and lost so much , and everything gets funny after a while and nothing is all that crucial . " Maybe that ' s why he didn ' t see it as crucial when editors kept turning down his manuscript of " A Short History of a Small Place . " Pearson said he ' d been writing short stories since he was 18 and had pretty much given up on publishing anything when he started on that book . He ' d gotten his bachelor ' s of arts and master ' s of arts degrees from North Carolina State University , and in the fall of 1981 , he went to Penn State in State College , Pa. , to get his doctorate and teach . But Pearson was lonely and time hung heavy . He decided to quit trying to please editors and write something that would entertain himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really that ' s what I ' d been needing to do all along  --  just entertain myself . " Pearson found himself so satisfied and so entertained ( " I ' d write something funny , and I ' d just howl " ) that after a month or two he dropped out of school and came back to North Carolina to write . To support himself , he took a job in Fuquay-Varina doing painting and carpentry for a friend . Pearson finished " A Short History " in December , 1982 , and it was another year before Linden Press bought it . ( The same week , he had an offer from Little , Brown , where he had submitted the manuscript on his own . ) In the meantime , he wrote another novel , which Linden Press bought , and he also has completed and sold a third novel . Now he ' s working on a fourth  --  each one set in North Carolina . Pearson believes he came by his storytelling instinct from his two Reidsville grandfathers , one of whom wrote essays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " a very peculiar and quiet man , " was his father ' s father , Rufus Bracken Pearson , a schoolteacher and a Baptist preacher , who also sold shrubbery and the Greensboro Daily News . The oral storyteller was his mother ' s father , John Elsworth Burton , a Reidsville barber . " He ran away from home when he was 15 and went to Atlanta , " said Pearson . " He was wildly entertaining . I remember some of his stories about being in Atlanta . There was one he told about having a choice whether to invest in a new soft drink called Coca-Cola or whether to invest in glass caskets . Of course my grandfather invested in the glass caskets . " Pearson lives on about 50 acres in a 60-year-old farmhouse he rents and has completely renovated . When he sold his second novel , he gave up the painting and carpentry and now spends his mornings writing and afternoons taking care of his house and farm and riding his bicycle . " I don ' t see a lot of people , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really have an inclination to hang around with people who write books . " I know how I am , " he said , " and I wouldn ' t want to hang around with me. "
