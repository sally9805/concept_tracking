It doesn ' t get any worse than this . The Bulls have hit rock bottom . This is a team in dire straits . The Bulls passively submitted to the Indiana Pacers 104-88 Friday night in the Stadium in front of 10 , 346 disgruntled fans who enjoyed the postgame Spinners concert far more than the act that preceded it . The Bulls have lost five straight , eight of their last nine and 13 of their last 15 . Their 17-36 record is the worst in the National Basketball Association ' s Eastern Conference , and the 88 points was their lowest regular- season output in two years . Bulls ' owner Jerry Reinsdorf sat with a disgusted look on his face all evening before finally leaving with a minute to go . Vice president of operations Jerry Krause stayed to the bitter end and then met with the coaching staff for 50 minutes . " The meeting was about what we can do to change the team around , " coach Stan Albeck said . " Jerry will be on the phone investigating the possibility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The NBA ' s trading deadline is midnight Saturday . After that , the Bulls are stuck with what they ' ve got . And that doesn ' t appear to be too much . Assistant coach Mike Thibault tried a little gimmick before Friday ' s game to put some spark in this lifeless bunch . He put together a video of some of the Bulls ' more exciting moments this season , complete with inspirational , rabble-rousing music . " There was no response , " Kyle Macy said . " The guys just sat there . " And they didn ' t do much more moving about on the court . The Bulls went through enough motions to stay close to the Pacers until the third quarter , when Indiana outscored the Bulls 27-10 during one stretch . Indiana led 82-69 after three quarters , and the Bulls never came closer than nine after that . Herb Williams led the Pacers with 39 points , his career high in the NBA . Rookie Charles Oakley , the Bulls ' only consistent player of late , turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 13 rebounds . Oakley made his first NBA start , but not at his normal power forward spot . He filled in at center for Jawann Oldham , who broke his jaw Wednesday against Philadelphia . He also will miss Sunday ' s game against Dallas . " Nobody said anything to me , but I was on the Red team ( starters ) in shootaround practice , so I knew , " Oakley said , trying to conceal a smile . " It felt good . " Oakley did his part , but foul trouble limited him to 13 minutes of playing time in the second half , and he eventually fouled out with 3 minutes 26 seconds left . With Oakley doing more sitting than boarding , the Bulls were outrebounded 26-10 in the second half . When asked what was wrong , Oakley just scratched his head and said : " I ' m just a new addition to this team . I can ' t see real , real deep into the mood of this team .

" If you go into a game thinking you ' re going to lose , you might as well not even take the floor , " he said . " If I was paying for a ticket , I wouldn ' t mind watching a losing team as long as they were busting their rears and giving an honest effort instead of not trying . " You would think that with the fans against us , the media writing bad stories about us , that it would bring the team together . There are only us 12 guys left .
