Some significant steps are taken to save the whales <P> To environmentalists , Interior Secretary James Watt sometimes seems to be an avenging Ahab , citing the Bible and warring against nature . But that image may be unfair . Last week , with the Secretary 's blessing , the U.S. came to the help of Watt 's surprising friends , the whales . <P> The occasion was the annual meeting of the International Whaling Commission ( IWC ) in the English seaside resort of Brighton . On the street , save-the-whales demonstrators waved placards , chanted slogans and even floated a 110-ft. inflatable whale named Big Flo . Inside the Victorian-style Brighton Metropole Hotel , the delegates from 31 member nations pondered the fate of the leviathans . The commission , formed after World War II to regulate whaling , has been setting annual quotas ever since . For this season the permissible commercial take had dwindled to 13,851 whales , 80% of them small minkes . That was less than a third of the total eight years ago . Hunting of such endangered species as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ altogether , except by or on behalf of Eskimos and other native peoples , while sperms may be taken only by coastal-based ships . <P> Still , marine biologists worry about the whale 's future . Chief U.S. Delegate Tom Garrett , a childhood friend of Watt 's and longtime defender of the whales , who was appointed at his urging , said that far too little is known about the populations of various species or their reproductive habits to permit the slaughter to go on , even at reduced levels . He backed a British proposal for a moratorium on all commercial whaling . <P> The Japanese , who along with the Soviets operate the only large ocean going whaling fleets , insisted that enough is known to set safe limits that will ensure the animals ' survival . Whaling , they added , was important to their economy and food supply ; they felt no legal or moral obligation to accept a ban . <P> Conservationist groups replied that the Japanese estimates were grossly overstated . But on the issue of the moratorium , their words , including President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " were to no avail . It failed to get a required three-fourths majority . So did another proposal to stop all whaling in the North Atlantic . <P> But at week 's end the antiwhaling forces won two significant victories . Over Japan 's objections , the conference set a " zero quota " on all sperm whaling in the Southern Hemisphere and the North Atlantic . As a gesture to the Japanese , a decision on the North Pacific was deferred until the spring . Said Garrett : " This might be the final curtain for sperm whaling . " <P> The delegates also agreed to outlaw " cold " ( or nonexplosive ) harpoons on minke whales , starting with the 1982-83 season . Conservationists claim these weapons prolong the animal 's final agony , but the Japanese insist that faster-killing grenade-tipped harpoons damage too much of the flesh and are dangerous to the hunters . The decision gives them time to develop a less damaging , safer explosive harpoon.                   @ @
