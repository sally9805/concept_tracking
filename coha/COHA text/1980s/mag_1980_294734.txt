Profane Celts cause scandal on the Thames <P> Thievery ! Strange rites of initiation ! Beatings ! Class warfare ! <P> <P> This is not a coming attraction for a documentary account of a week in a British public school . It is , rather , a rough synopsis of a lively and incautious new play , The Romans in Britain , whose combination of ancient history , contemporary politics and ageless human indulgence has created Britain 's biggest theatrical controversy in a decade . Howard Brenton 's below-the-belt pageant , written with profane wit and political passion , is presented under the high-flown auspices of the National Theater , which has been threatened in the ensuing dustup with various reprisals , including the withdrawal of government endowment that totals over $1.5 million . <P> The Romans is overwhehningly-perhaps recklessly-ambitious , an attempt to correlate the twilight of early British history with some of the nation 's bedrock myths and most urgent contemporary problems . Celtic lore and Roman might thus flow through the first stirrings of Arthurian legend and course straight into the Irish issue . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a British spy waits in a field to eliminate a high-ranking member of the I.R.A . " It 's Celts we 're fighting in Ireland , " he ruminates . " We wo n't get anywhere till we know what that means . " <P> Brenton 's game attempts to show just what that does mean have been scorned for political superficiality and shortsightedness . But Brenton 's presentation is not meant to hold up in Parliament ; it is a metaphorical point whose truth is poetic . The ruckus has little to do with such niceties of debate , however . It centers on the generous amounts of sex and violence with which The Romans was staged . Bad enough , for fainthearts in the audience , that the first act contains a lynching , a throat cutting and assorted acts of bloody roughhouse . It also features three Celts bounding around the vast stage of the Olivier Theater in nothing but their birthday suits and some anachronistic Rod Stewart haircuts . Frontal nudity in the National Theater is like a flasher in a cathedral . Worse follows : the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roman invaders and the sodomizing of a third . This sight encouraged the leader of the Greater London Council , Sir Horace Cutler , to send down telegraphic thunderbolts about the renewal of the National 's subsidy . Censor-without-Portfolio Mary Whitehouse read about-but did not see-The Romans , and immediately swore out a complaint . Scotland Yard 's Obscene Publications Squad was sent to investigate . The battle was joined . <P> James Fenton , drama critic of the Sunday Times , called the play " a nauseating load of rubbish , " and yearned for the resignation of National Theater Director Peter Hall , who steadfastly stood by Brenton and the production . Playwright Edward Bond weighed in with a defense so oblique that he never mentioned the play by name . He did , however , call for the resignation of Fenton , while John Osborne , who has had his own wrangles with the censor , addressed a sally to the Guardian : " Sir-I do n't go to the theater to see a lot of buggery . We get quite enough of that at home . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
