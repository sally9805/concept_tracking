The tabloids gave Andy Warhol a Viking funeral last week , as well they might . At 58 he suffered cardiac arrest following gall-bladder surgery . To the end , he remained surrounded by an aura of popular fame such as no other American artist had ever known in his or her lifetime  --  a flash-card recognizability that almost rivaled Picasso 's . Millions of Americans who could not have picked Jasper Johns or Henri Matisse from a police lineup could identify that pale , squarish , loose-lipped face with its acne , blinking gaze and silvery wig . <P> He was , after all , that weird guy who did those soup cans a quarter of a century ( was it really that long ? ) ago . The working-class hero , son of an immigrant Czech coal miner named Warhola in Pittsburgh , who for a time acquired a court that seemed almost Habsburgian in scope if not in distinction : the Velazquez dwarfs of the Factory . The guy in the photo with Madonna , Liza , Jackie O. The aesthete who said money was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future everyone would be famous for 15 minutes , thus offering a tacky sort of transcendence to every hair stylist , fledgling actor and art student in America . The ageless child of media fame who made scores of underground films in which often nothing happened ( Empire offered eight hours of staring at the Empire State Building ) and who published his own magazine , Interview . Andy , the living transparency , with his face pressed to the shop window of the American dream and his head full of schemes to titillate an aging , youth-obsessed American culture . <P> Warhol 's early works were the ones that mattered . He began as a commercial artist , became for a time ( between about 1962 and 1968 ) a fine artist with something akin to genius and then lapsed back into a barely disguised form of commercial art . His sense of timing , his grip on how to give an image graphic clout , and his fixation on style as an end in itself all came out of his years of advertising and display work during the ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Vogue . By the end of this period he was rich , professionally famous and yearning for recognition as a serious artist . <P> The opportunity came with the Pop movement in the early ' 60s . His contribution was the image taken from advertising or tabloid journalism : grainy , immediate , a slice of unexplained life half-registered over and over , full of slippages and visual stutters . Marilyn Monroe repeated 50 times , 200 Campbell 's soup cans , a canvas filled edge to edge with effigies of Liz , Jackie , dollar bills or Elvis . Absurd though these pictures looked at first , Warhol 's fixation on repetition and glut emerged as the most powerful statement ever made by an American artist on the subject of a consumer economy . The cranking out of designed objects of desire was so faithfully mirrored in Warhol 's images and so approvingly mimicked in his sense of culture that no one , in fact , could be sure what he thought . <P> He was also , from the outset , much possessed by death . Warhol 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ news photos of fatal car wrecks are suffused with dread and compassion beneath their icily casual surface . Such works looked amazingly raw , frank and direct when they were made . More than 20 years later , they still do .
