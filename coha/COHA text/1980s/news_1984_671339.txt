The number of infants involved is not great compared with many other afflictions , but the tragedy is real and growing. // From relatively few cases a decade ago , the estimated number of infants legally blinded by the disorder , called RLF , for retrolental fibroplasia , has risen to more than 500 a year in this country. // An additional 1 , 500 children each year lose part of their eyesight to RLF . And the numbers may be higher , because doctors are not required to report the disorder to any data- gathering body. // RLF , in what has turned out to be the second outbreak of its kind , appears to have surpassed all other causes of blindness in newborns combined . The first outbreak began about 1943 , continued until 1955 and finally abated. // The new surge , in addition to the tragedy it brings to children and their parents , now poses one of the most perplexing problems pediatricians have faced in years , according to interviews and a review of the medical literature. // Until recently , doctors were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believed that the administration of high concentrations of oxygen for prolonged periods soon after birth damaged the eyes of infants born prematurely , ultimately detaching the retina. // Accordingly , the use of oxygen in nurseries was strictly curtailed , and this led to a marked reduction in the number of cases . Indeed , the link between oxygen and RLF became so solid that most physicians regarded oxygen as the sole cause . They also considered RLF an iatrogenic problem ; that is , one caused solely by medical treatment. // As Sir Stewart Duke-Elder , an ophthalmologist who edited the most comprehensive textbook of eye diseases , said in a description of RLF : " Never in the history of ophthalmology has a blinding condition become so quickly widespread and equally rapidly abolished. " // Few dispute that oxygen was the major culprit in the first epidemic . But there is now a deepening mystery about the second epidemic. // Although excess oxygen clearly can still be blamed for some current RLF blindness , it is equally clear that at least 163 cases developed among infants who had breathed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , RLF has occurred in stillborn infants and in infants who were blue from lack of oxygen as a result of birth defects affecting the heart. // Thus , other factors must be involved as well , and the nation ' s pediatricians are at a loss to specify just what they may be or how to halt the new epidemic. // Pediatric leaders now say the overemphasis of the role of oxygen in the past has created a false impression that all RLF is preventable . Many cases may not be avoidable at all . However , some studies have hinted that vitamin E may reduce the severity . An increasing number of pediatricians are prescribing vitamin E for premature infants , not in the belief that its value is proved , but more in the hope that it is the something that will work , at least in some cases. // Still , even when vitamin E is given as a preventive , RLF cases occur , and there is no effective treatment for RLF once it develops. // Because RLF is limited almost exclusively to premature babies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the sickest and most immature infants are at greatest risk . But even then doctors can not predict which infants will develop blindness. // // Dr. Jerold F. Lucey , a pediatrician at the University of Vermont College of Medicine in Burlington , said that RLF " is one of the most devastating things to have happen to you because you work for weeks to keep a baby alive and then suddenly find out he is blind . You think you have caused the blindness , and you can imagine the crushing effect of that. " // Dr. Lucey is also editor of Pediatrics , a medical journal published by the American Academy of Pediatrics in Evanston , Ill. , and co-author with Dr. Barbara Dangman of an article in its January issue reviewing " the second epidemic of RLF " and challenging the dogma that oxygen is its major cause. // That article and others link the new epidemic of RLF with the more recent medical and technological advances that have enabled about half the infants weighing less than 2. 2 pounds to survive . In a sense , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because only about 8 percent of premature babies weighing less than 2. 2 pounds survived at the time of the first epidemic. // Much of this higher survival rate is attributed to new medical capabilities that help premature infants overcome potentially fatal breathing difficulties in the first few weeks of life . But many pediatricians , in trying to balance the potential benefits against the risks of such therapy , feel they are living a nightmare. // // Although doctors try to maintain objectivity in treating patients , emotional factors sometimes affect their decision-making . Several pediatricians interviewed said that when they treat newborns with oxygen , their deep concern is that if the infant develops loss of vision , a lawsuit could be brought at any time over the next 20 years , as has happened. // The problem can be illustrated by these alternatives : // If physicians prescribe oxygen only in the smallest amounts , the baby risks brain damage but the doctors may have a safer malpractice defense. // If pediatricians prescribe larger amounts of oxygen to keep the babies alive as well as to prevent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the doctors perceive themselves as vulnerable to lawsuits. // " That is why pediatricians are a little paranoid about RLF , " Dr. Lucey said. // About 20 , 000 infants are born in this country each year who weigh less than 3. 3 pounds . Of these , about 2 , 000 become partly blind from RLF and more than 500 become legally blind. // Among the many unanswered questions about RLF is why so many infants develop the earliest stages of the condition but then escape any visual loss at all . The condition progresses to blindness in only a small minority of them , and no one knows why some are more susceptible than others . The damage is a result of the death of cells in the retina in the back of the eye , and occurs gradually until scarring leads to detachment of the retina. // In the first epidemic of RLF , an estimated 700 RLF blindness cases occurred each year in the United States and 300 elsewhere . Although precise data concerning the incidence are lacking , there is little doubt that the incidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ completely vanished. // The new epidemic appears to have begun in the late 1970 ' s . In the absence of a national reporting system , the rise can be seen from data reported by individual hospitals . At Children ' s Hospital in Columbus , Ohio , a dramatic rise in the number of RLF cases has occurred since 1977 , according to Dr. Frederick A. Davidorf , a Columbus physician . At least 88 cases were diagnosed from 1977 through 1980 , compared with the 24 cases reported from 1970 through 1976. // Nationally , 546 infants were blinded by RLF in 1979 , the latest year for which figures are available , according to calculations made by Dr. Dale L. Phelps of the University of California at Los Angeles. // // RLF was recognized as a new disorder in 1942 , and it took more than a decade for researchers to link it to oxygen . In fact , the initial suggestion of a causative relationship between oxygen and RLF was greeted with skepticism by much of the medical community in the early 1950 ' s. // But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to account for the dangers of oxygen and stern warnings were written in textbooks . The thinking became so rigid that every case of RLF was taken as proof of improper use of supplemental oxygen , according to Dr. William A. Silverman ' s account in his book titled " Retrolental Fibroplasia : A Modern Parable , " which Grune and Stratton published in 1980. // Yet there was evidence to the contrary . Some RLF cases were reported in which blindness was worse in one eye , a finding inconsistent with a toxin such as oxygen , which affects the entire system. // Even when doctors specifically reported in medical journals that infants had received no extra oxygen , such reports were generally treated with skepticism . Doctors even questioned the accuracy of such diagnoses . Now they do not. // To reassess the problem , Dr. Lucey recently analyzed some data reported from four studies during the first epidemic . He found that among 137 infants who received large doses of oxygen , 51 , or 37 percent , did not develop RLF . Of the 407 infants who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 89 , or 22 percent , developed RLF. // Additional evidence that factors other than oxygen are the major cause comes from experience in using techniques to continuously monitor the amounts of oxygen . Also , the persistence of RLF , despite widespread use of these techniques , has made pediatricians realize that precise recommendations can not be made as to what doses of oxygen therapy are safe and for how long. // // Scientists have offered a wide variety of possible causes of RLF . One theoretical possibility is blood transfusions . In some studies , they were the only factor that could be correlated with RLF . The theoretical explanation was that the adult red blood cells that were transfused to the infants delivered oxygen more efficiently and thus sent a damaging supply of oxygen to the retina . Doctors are discussing plans for a clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a surgical technique to freeze part of the eye to stop the progression of the disorder . The aim is to destroy affected portions of the retina , on the theory that the dying cells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and scar tissue . Because no one knows what the long-term effects might be on the eye of a infant born prematurely , the technique would be used on only one eye of each child involved in the study , according to Dr. Phelps , the U.C.L.A. pediatrician. // Meanwhile , some pediatricians have expressed concern that a high price has been paid for curtailing the use of oxygen among premature infants . The widely accepted dogma that oxygen caused all RLF appears to have inhibited much badly needed research. // Further , in 1973 , Dr. K. W. Cross of London raised some provocative questions about how many premature infants might have died from the curtailed use of oxygen . According to Dr. Cross ' s calculations , for each case of blindness prevented , about 16 infants died as a result of inadequate oxygenation . Those calculations have been challenged . Nevertheless , the unanswered questions make all the more important the need to develop a better national reporting system for conditions like RLF so that fewer babies will be blinded. //        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
