With her large , dark eyes and thick , waist-length hair , the 18-year-old was a favorite among the truck drivers who called at the squalid brothel on Highway 45 in Ulundurpet , a small town in southern India . When she was placed in a ) reformatory for convicted prostitutes in June , five men offered to bail her out . Today she is emaciated , weighing only 62 lbs. , her hair is falling out , and she is showing unmistakable signs of mental derangement . The source of the woman 's suffering : the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome , or AIDS , virus . Doctors at the home want to delay her release , fearing that if she returns to prostitution , she will transmit the AIDS virus to her clients . <P> Despite the rapid spread of AIDS throughout the developing world , its appearance in India came as a shock to the country . The case of the young woman , as well as those of 18 other Indians known to have been infected with the virus ( two of whom have died ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a burgeoning population of more than 750 million make it difficult for Indian doctors to cope with even familiar diseases , such as tuberculosis , malaria and cholera . Now that the first AIDS cases have been detected , says Dr. V. Ramalingaswami , former director general of the Indian Council of Medical Research , " we in India have been shaken and face a moment of truth . " <P> Indian researchers have long been afraid that AIDS , which destroys the body 's natural defenses against disease , would spread rapidly once it reached the subcontinent . Known as HIV , or human immunodeficiency virus , the AIDS microbe is transmitted by sexual intercourse , blood transfusions and contaminated needles , though not , say researchers , by casual contact with infected persons . During pregnancy , infected women can pass the virus on to their unborn children . <P> The first AIDS cases were identified five years ago in the U.S. , leading many officials in developing countries to assume that it was solely a Western disease . Today the U.S. accounts for 80% of the 28,976 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But it increasingly appears that the number of reported AIDS cases is far smaller than the true incidence of the disease . Halfdan Mahler , director general of WHO , estimates that there may be as many as 100,000 cases globally , plus up to 10 million carriers of the virus . <P> The disease is spreading fast in Africa , where it was first detected in 1982 , but is believed by some medical researchers to have appeared decades earlier . In Kigali , the capital of Rwanda , one test discovered AIDS exposure in 18% of the city 's inhabitants . In Uganda , a study of more than 1,000 pregnant women in the capital city of Kampala showed that 13.6% carried the virus . While male victims outnumber female victims by 13 to 1 in the U.S. , in Africa the disease appears to strike women and men in roughly equal numbers . The same holds true in Haiti .
