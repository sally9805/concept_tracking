Catholics and Episcopalians worship together in a unique church <P> The priest at the altar lifts a loaf of pita bread and recites the familiar words of consecration : " Take this , all of you , and eat it : this is my body which will be given up for you ... do this in memory of me . " Meanwhile , at the opposite end of the sanctuary , a second priest lifts an identical loaf and intones : " Take , eat : This is my Body , which is given for you . Do this for the remembrance of me ... " <P> The overlapping words convey an impression of unity and division . They were spoken last Sunday , during the 74th annual Week of Prayer for Christian Unity , as they are almost every week , at the Church of the Holy Apostles in Norfolk , Va . It is the only U.S. congregation officially listed as both a Roman Catholic and Episcopal church . Anglicanism kept a Catholic style of worship when it broke with Rome in the 16th century . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , parishioners recite the same liturgies , Catholic one week , Episcopal the next . From classes in religious education to church socials , Holy Apostles runs almost all activities together . <P> Though the Anglican-Roman Catholic International Commission laid down a doctrinal basis for joint Communion in 1971 , the Church of Rome does not permit the practice . While negotiations on such matters proceeded on the world level , the Catholic and Episcopal dioceses covering Norfolk decided to try something specific on their own . Five years ago , a committee began thrashing out the details of how a joint congregation could work . By November 1977 , a chapel had been rented and two priests had been recruited : Catholic Raymond A. Barton , now 40 , and Episcopalian Donald W. Gross , 44 . <P> To govern Holy Apostles and handle disputes , the planners set up a joint council . Music proved troublesome , so the church alternates Catholic chants and contemporary music with the Episcopal hymnal . Barton and Gross take turns preaching and presiding at services and assist each other during baptisms and confirmations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 300 members , two-thirds of them Catholic . One reason it has not grown faster is that it expects worshipers to do pastoral work ; most are active visiting hospitals and prisons and in other part-time ministries . Says Episcopalian Carolyn Pollie , a mother of four and a founding member : " We do n't expect people to go to church ; we expect them to be the church . " <P> The goal of the group , says Pollie , is to " heal some of the obvious injury of separation . " John McManus , a Catholic newspaper reporter who was once thrown out of school as a boy for beating up Protestants , is now shedding " we-they " attitudes and giving money to Episcopal missionaries . Among the most obvious beneficiaries are people in mixed marriages . Episcopalian Jean Koch used to attend Mass with her Catholic husband and daughter but secretly " felt deprived . " <P> Now the family worships together happily .
