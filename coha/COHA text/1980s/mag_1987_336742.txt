Daniel Ortega Saavedra had one of the busiest weeks of his life last week . He spent the first few days in Moscow , attending the celebration of the 70th anniversary of the Bolshevik Revolution and meeting with Soviet Leader Mikhail Gorbachev . Then , as Ortega was flying home , his wife Rosario Murillo gave birth to the couple 's seventh child and first daughter . On Thursday night Ortega delivered what he described as the most difficult speech of his career , a 50-minute oration in which he offered to negotiate a cease-fire with the contras . The next day Ortega met in his Managua office with TIME Correspondent John Moody . Excerpts : <P> On his speech . I think that the people who came were expecting something different . Perhaps they expected us to take a totally closed position . The cease-fire negotiations were the most difficult part , because it was necessary to make very clear to the people that what 's not involved is a political dialogue . We are against a political dialogue . That is an unchanging position . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beyond these , we would be going too far , affecting the credibility of the government with the Nicaraguan people . <P> On the peace process . You get the impression that only Nicaragua is obligated to comply , and only it is being publicly singled out , and not Honduras , where there are contra bases , or Costa Rica , where contra leaders live and where armed groups are launching attacks against Nicaragua . This is prohibited by the accord . <P> On the U.S. The first message is the massive number ( ( an estimated 50,000 ) ) of people who came to hear my speech . President Reagan should take this into account . Any military option would be met with the armed resistance of the entire people . The other message is that Nicaragua is willing to live up to the peace accord . <P> On whether Nicaragua is playing for time . That idea is unfounded . Look at the facts . The measures we announced yesterday are proof . The amnesty and the lifting of the state of emergency will not be determined by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been set up by the Arias accord . <P> On possible amnesty for former national guardsmen . We have stuck firmly to the position that the amnesty does not cover Somoza 's guardsmen . They are not covered because they committed notorious crimes . <P> On future progress . So far , there has been an overall advance . The Central American governments still have disagreements , and sometimes we make statements that make it sound as if the whole agreement is going down the drain . But the desire for peace once again wins out .
