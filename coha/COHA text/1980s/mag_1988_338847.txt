The verdict confirmed the worst suspicions of many of the 200 blacks who live in the East Texas town of Hemphill . Last month a jury in that tiny village ( pop . 1,350 ) found three white police officers not guilty of violating the civil rights of Loyal Garner , a black truck driver who had been arrested for drunken driving and died after an alleged jailhouse beating . Lamented Will Smith , a local black minister : " It seems as if there 's justice for whites only in this society . " <P> From the beginning , many townspeople doubted that the Garner family could get a fair hearing in Hemphill . Their concern was validated when Dorie Lee Hudson Handy , a 45-year-old cleaning woman and the lone black on the jury , confessed to the Fort Worth Star-Telegram that she believed the lawmen were guilty but voted for their acquittal because " I was just one black against all those ( ( white ) ) people . " <P> Cries of whites-only justice echo as well in New York City . " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sharpton at innumerable demonstrations on behalf of Tawana Brawley , the black teenager from Wappingers Falls , N.Y. , who says she was abducted and raped by six white men . For more than eight months , Sharpton and Activist Attorneys C. Vernon Mason and Alton Maddox Jr . have waged guerrilla warfare against the state officials looking into the case and effectively prevented any significant investigation of the charges . The trio 's wild claims and controversial tactics have alienated many blacks as well as whites , but their allegation that the girl was treated unfairly  --  and verdicts like the one in Hemphill  --  have stirred up new concern about an old question : Is the criminal-justice system biased against blacks ? <P> Many blacks are apparently convinced that it is . When the New York Times and WCBS-TV News conducted a poll on attitudes toward the justice system last January , only 28% of the blacks questioned felt that the courts are evenhanded toward white and black defendants . Such sentiments may reflect , in part , black discontent with the handling of several recent racially charged events @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bernhard Goetz cases . These impressions also point to a deep-rooted distrust of the system , engendered by years of legally sanctioned injustice against blacks and other minorities . <P> Significant gains have been made since the days when blacks in the South were allowed to sit on only one side of the courtroom . In 1986 , for example , the Supreme Court made it more difficult for prosecutors to use peremptory challenges to keep blacks off juries . A few months later , an all-white jury in Alabama awarded $7 million to a black mother who sued the United Klans of America over the lynching death of her son , a far cry from the days when an all-white Mississippi panel freed two white men in the infamous 1955 murder of 14-year-old Emmett Till . <P> Nevertheless , the perception lingers that justice remains far from color- blind . " There is a view in this country that if you 're poor and black or Hispanic or Native American , you wo n't get a fair deal , " says James B. Eaglin , chairman of the National Association @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contentions that there are biases at every level of the system are well founded . "
