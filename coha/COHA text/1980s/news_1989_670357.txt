Currency warrants , little-known securities that trade for only a few dollars each , have recently been a hot way for get-rich-quick investors to bet on the dollar . But they ' re also a good way to get poor quick . The securities were introduced in the U.S. two years ago by a handful of companies , including Xerox Corp . , American Telephone &; Telegraph Co. and General Electric Co. ' s credit unit . They give investors the right to swap West German marks or Japanese yen for dollars at a specified exchange rate . As a result , the value of currency warrants rises and falls with the dollar ' s strength in the foreign exchange markets . In some cases , investors have made profits of 30% on them in a matter of months . The catch is that investors aren ' t just betting on a rise in the dollar , they ' re betting on a huge rise . And some currency experts say , right now , that may be a sucker ' s bet . Warrants may be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " but profiting from them " is a matter of timing , " says Beverly Hills , Calif. , broker Paul B. Berman , who trades warrants in $10 , 000 lots on behalf of individual investors . He warns that warrants are suitable " only for sophisticated speculators . " A prospectus for one currency-warrant offering is even more grim : " Investors should be prepared to sustain a total loss . " Sixteen currency warrants , with a total market value of about $1 billion , are listed on the American Stock Exchange , where they are currently selling for about $1 to $8 each . Demand for the securities soared as the dollar rose against the mark and the yen last month . Although demand has eased since the dollar peaked at nearly 2. 05 marks and 151. 85 yen on June 15 , Amex officials say daily trading volume is running at about 95 , 000 warrants  --  more than double normal levels . The attraction of currency warrants is that they offer a convenient way to speculate on the dollar without committing a lot of capital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sold back to the issuing companies once they hit " strike " prices preset by a formula . Commissions are similar to those on stocks , usually 1% to 2% both buying and selling . There is no minimum purchase required to trade warrants on the Amex , although anything less than 100 warrants is considered an odd lot . Companies , on the other hand , will redeem warrants only in 2 , 000-warrant lots . For small investors , currency warrants are " the only way to play the long-term currency markets , " says Suresh Krishnan , a vice president for international fixed-income research with Merrill Lynch Capital Markets Inc . The risks , however , are substantial . Liquidity is one problem . " What happens if the dollar stays low and people lose interest ? " Mr. Krishnan says . Some days , there has been no trading whatsoever in some warrants . An even bigger worry is the odds against making money . With some currency warrants , the dollar has to appreciate 15% or more before investors can redeem the securities at a profit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unheard of . When they occur , the value of the warrant increases substantially . Investors can bypass the issuing company and sell currency warrants on the Amex , where swings in their price are based more on investor sentiment about the dollar than on the company ' s formula for repayment . But investors may not be able to sell their currency warrants at a profit even if the dollar rises . Consider General Electric Credit Corp. ' s West German mark currency warrants , issued in June of last year when the dollar was buying 1. 82 marks . Since then , the dollar has appreciated 2% . But the price of the currency warrants on the Amex has fallen sharply , to $2. 44 from an original offering price of $4. 75 . That ' s because , under the terms of the offering , investors won ' t even earn the original purchase price back from the company until the dollar rises above 2. 1 marks . Yesterday , the dollar was trading at a bit more than 1. 86 marks . If the dollar really takes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than triples in value . It quadruples at 3. 1 marks . But the U.S currency hasn ' t gotten anywhere near that level since mid-1985 . Of the 16 currency warrant issues outstanding , only two are currently at prices above their original offering prices . And , by their nature , currency warrants often decline in value the older they get , even if the dollar rises , because the new buyer doesn ' t get the benefit of the full three- or five-year term . Moreover , further sharp gains in the dollar " aren ' t promising now , " contends Charles Lieberman , managing director of financial markets research for Manufacturers Hanover Securities Corp . He and other analysts expect a continuing weakening of the dollar.  --  - Table Roller-Coaster Riding the Dollar Prices of the five most actively traded currency warrant issues in July ( all yen issues ) on the Amex : PRICE PCT .
