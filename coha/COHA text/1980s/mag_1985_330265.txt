Phyllis McGrady certainly does not act bellicose . As executive producer of ABC 's Good Morning America , she seems relaxed , soft-spoken , charming . But there she is , sitting in her Manhattan office , comparing the race among the three network morning shows to a pitched battle worthy of the Iliad . " The competition is ferocious , " McGrady says . " It 's war games , the combat zone . " Several blocks away , Steve Friedman , executive producer of NBC 's Today show , seems like ideal fishing-trip company : funny , good-hearted , gregarious . But turn to the subject of Good Morning America and Friedman climbs the ramparts . " They want us to die , " he says , voice rising . " I 'm telling you , it 's war , and we 're out there to kill them . " <P> Welcome to the bullet-scarred land of morning television , the breakfast firing range where the three networks snap , crackle and pop for rating points . The fray has always been fierce , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever . After gradually closing in on Good Morning America for more than a year , the Today show has beaten or tied its ABC competitor five weeks in the past three months , thus breaking GMA 's 163-week hold on first place . Though Today still spends most of its time as a close second , * the taste of victory brings fresh confidence to the NBC corridors . " We think we will be No. 1 , " says Today Co-Host Jane Pauley . " We 've got the momentum . " <P> Over at CBS , however , no one is dancing in the hallways . The CBS Morning <P> News , the perennial also-ran , is glued in third place despite the addition of Phyllis George as co-anchor . The show has been hobbled by the poor chemistry between Bill Kurtis , a seasoned television reporter from Chicago who joined the show in 1982 , and George , a former Miss America with no newsgathering experience . Try as he might to banter with George , Kurtis still acted a bit like a college senior who is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is flustered by her answers . After weeks of rumors , Kurtis left the show last week ; though a contract has not been signed yet , he likely will return to CBS-owned WBBM-TV in Chicago . Veteran CBS Reporter Bob Schieffer will join George until a new co-host is named , probably in the early fall . <P> Though George seems more comfortable on the air than when she began in January ( she no longer flubs lines with abandon , like referring to Andrew Lloyd Webber as the composer of Jesus Christ Superstore ) , she is still capable of the silly gaffe . CBS executives stand strongly by her , even after her infamous invitation to Gary Dotson and Cathleen Crowell Webb , the main characters in the recent Chicago rape-testimony recantation , to hug on the air . " We needed a high-powered , experienced TV personality to draw people away from two established , successful competitors , " says Executive Producer Jon Katz . " Phyllis George will bring a lot of people into our tent . All she needs is time . " <P> George @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , including a new set complete with couch , brassy theme music and twisting , gridlike graphics . Estimated price tag : $2 million . Despite the show 's dismal ratings , Katz remains confident . He points out that the program expanded to two hours only three years ago ; before that , it split its time slot with Captain Kangaroo . " Morning News suffers , more than anything else , from not being on the air long enough , " says Katz.
