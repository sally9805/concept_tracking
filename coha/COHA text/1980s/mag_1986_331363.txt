Many political observers feel that New York Democratic Governor Mario Cuomo 's 68.4% approval rating , national stature and $8 million campaign chest make him all but invincible as he prepares to run for re-election this year . State Republicans , fearing that Cuomo may also be a strong presidential candidate in 1988 , have been courting an unlikely contender who they think could at least bloody , if not beat , the Governor . Last week Henry Kissinger , former Secretary of State in the Nixon and Ford Administrations , allowed that Republican leaders had urged him to run , and that he was actually engaged in a " consideration of their views . " <P> The G.O.P. touted Kissinger , 62 , as a formidable candidate , boasting instant name recognition and great potential fund-raising ability . But skeptics , mainly Democrats , doubted that the diplomat turned high-priced consultant is cut out for local politics or the rigors of the campaign trail . As Cuomo told the New York Times : " I know more about Buffalo than Beirut . Dr. Kissinger would be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beat the great global strategist ? Yes , said the Governor , by " at least one vote . "
