They were flying tee shots 40 yards past him , hitting short irons into the greens at Salem CC after he had struck a fairway wood and trailed along in silence . " It ' s just a matter of using different clubs , " said remarkable Jack McNiff at the end of another day . " If you have to hit longer irons and woods more than anybody else , " hewent on , " it makes you better when you have to use them . If you ' re only hitting short irons all the time , you have a weakness . I should go out and practice , but discretion persuades me to rest . " So the ageless odyssey of Jack McNiff went on yesterday in the 72d State Amateur , providing a nostalgic backdrop to a tournament he first played in 46 years ago at Brae Burn and has livened up this year on the course where he grew up as a caddie . At 62 , McNiff strode briskly into the quarterfinals , the oldest qualifying medalist in history on Wednesday , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to win it ? Well , there are three matches and any number of holes of golf to go . On this bright and breezy day , McNiff beat 1979 finalist Joe Henley , 23 , 2 and 1 in the morning round . In the afternoon , he won , 1 up , over Bill Martin , 20 , whose father ( a spectator yesterday ) won the tournament in 1948 and 1951 and was a contemporary of McNiff ' s as a junior before World War II . " When he ( Bill ) walked , " said McNiff , " he reminded me of the way Eddie and his twin Leo ( the 1941 state Amateur champion who was killed in the war ) walked . They were the reigning junior players . We met a lot . I went to Peabody High . They went to Watertown . We beat them for the state championship . " McNiff , a Peabody attorney who overcame major surgery four years ago and has since settled nicely into senior golf , came back from two-down after six holes against Martin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Martin three-putted the 12th and 13th . " That , " Martin lamented , " was about it . " But Martin won the 15th with a par 5 and seemed about to level the match on the 16th , before McNiff rolled in a 15-foot putt for a halve . After McNiff missed a chance to win it on the 17th when a six- foot putt stayed wide , Martin pushed his tee shot to the right and eventually conceded the final putt . McNiff will be joined in the quarterfinals this morning by his next opponent , Ray Richard , 30 , of Thorny Lea ; Ponkapoag ' s peripatetic Bob DePopolo ; Jim McDermott of Fall River ; co-medalist Paul Cortese , 30 , of Haverhill ; Temple junior Kevin Klier , 20 ; Furman sophomore Steve Minelli , 19 ; and 1978 semifinalist Mike Prendergast of Wollaston . Of the eight , only DePopolo and Prendergast have been in the quarterfinals before . DePopolo , whose predilection for " the fun and excitement " of match play golf is sometimes in the minority , was in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Minelli , the 1978 State Junior champion from Plymouth , was four down to Walter Sharis at the turn in his second-round match . " I was ready to quit after a half shank on 9 , " he said . Instead , he shot an incoming two-under 34 when he made three 25-foot putts . " I just wanted to make it respectable , " said Minelli , " but when I won 10 and 12 , I said , Let ' s go . ' " Cortese , weakened by a recurring bout with herpes on Wednesday , slept for 12 hours that night , opened up his Methuen variety store at 5:30 yesterday morning and said , " I felt good . If I had to lose , I had no excuse . " So he had four birdies in a 1-up morning win over Fred Bitters of Greenfield and stormed back from three down after seven holes in the afternoon to beat defending champion Ed Polchlopek of Hampden on the 18th green , 1 up . Richard executed " one of those shots you dream about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Charles River to stay alive , then won it on the 19th with a birdie . From a downhill , sidehill lie behind a tree on the 18th , Richard faded a four wood around the tree to within 15 feet from the pin and , two putts later , to the 19th tee and a chance to meet Mr. McNiff . " I ' ve never played anybody that old , " said Richard . Welcome to the club . Neither has anybody else in the State Amateur quarterfinals . Before this morning at 8.
