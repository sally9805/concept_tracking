Mikhail Gorbachev , supersalesman , was at it again , making a disarmingly simple offer that seemed hard to refuse . If the U.S. would follow the U.S.S.R. in halting all nuclear testing , said the Soviet leader , the agreement would be " some kind of prologue " to eliminating nuclear weapons . In a televised speech , Gorbachev announced that his moratorium on underground testing , which began in August 1985 , would be extended for a fourth time , to Jan. 1 , 1987 . He even suggested that a comprehensive test-ban treaty might be signed at a summit meeting with President Reagan this year . <P> Seeing nothing new , the Reagan Administration 's response was swift and negative . " A nuclear testing moratorium , " said White House Spokesman Larry Speakes , " is not in the security interests of the United States , our friends or our allies . " The Administration reiterated its objections : the U.S. must continue testing to check the reliability of its stockpiles , a ban could not be properly verified , further testing is needed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The President 's aides do not like to mention that a ban would also slow development of the Strategic Defense Initiative . <P> Many officials were quick to criticize Gorbachev 's overtures as transparent public relations stunts . " It 's one more chance for Gorbachev to try to make the Soviet Union look like it 's pursuing peace , " said a Western diplomat , " while the White House goes on endangering the world . " But the Soviets ' campaign has been effective , particularly in Western Europe ( with the notable exception of France ) , and some analysts think the U.S. should be more flexible . Former Defense Secretary James Schlesinger faults the Administration for " losing the initiative " in the arms-control game . He suggests that the U.S. resist a complete moratorium but negotiate either an agreement for a lower test- blast ceiling ( up to 15 kilotons ) or a quota system limiting the number of detonations . <P> But such concessions are unlikely . Even as Gorbachev was renewing his test- ban offer , the Pentagon continued plans to equip B-52 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the unratified SALT II treaty limits by mid-November . The defense budget passed by the House of Representatives , however , would cut off money for any weapons that would cause the U.S. to exceed SALT II weapons levels . The House also demanded a halt to any nuclear testing above the level of a single kiloton.
