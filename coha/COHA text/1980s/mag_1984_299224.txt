Do orphaned embryos have legal rights ? <P> Sitting in a stainless-steel vat of liquid nitrogen at Queen Victoria Medical Center in Melbourne , chilled to a crisp-320 F , are 200 glass tubes , each holding a microscopic embryo . Just two to eight cells in size , they are babies in waiting , life on ice , kept for possible use by participants in the hospital 's in-vitro fertilization ( IVF ) program . Last week hospital officials were stunned to learn that two of their charges could be heirs to a million-dollar fortune . The news set armchair ethicists around the world abuzz and forced Australian policymakers to ponder an area of the law that is indeed embryonic . <P> The unsettled estate-and the frozen assets-was that of Mario and Elsa Rios , a Los Angeles couple who made a fortune in real estate . In 1978 , after Elsa 's ten-year-old daughter by a previous marriage accidentally shot herself , the disconsolate couple sought to have another child . Unable to conceive by natural means , they turned , in 1981 , to Melbourne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was infertile , doctors used sperm from an anonymous donor to fertilize a number of eggs taken from his 37-year-old wife . Several were implanted , and two spares were frozen for use in case the pregnancy failed . As it happened , Elsa Rios miscarried , but she decided to postpone any further attempts until she felt " emotionally ready . " <P> In April 1983 , the couple died in a plane crash in Chile , leaving no wills . Under California law , Michael Rios , Mario 's son by an earlier marriage , is entitled to his father 's share of the estate . Elsa 's share goes to her 65-year-old mother . The discovery of the embryos has , however , raised a number of questions . Do they , for example , have any rights of inheritance ? To whom do they belong , and who has jurisdiction over their fate ? Most basic of all , do they have a right to life ? <P> This last question in particular has created a furor . Protestant churches have argued that the eggs should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ die naturally . Australian right-to-life groups , the Roman Catholic Church and some Orthodox Jewish leaders have protested that this would violate the sanctity of life . Instead , they believe the cells should be implanted in volunteer surrogate mothers . <P> That idea is fraught with problems , not the least of which are medical . According to Dr. Carl Wood , head of Queen Victoria 's IVF unit , freezing techniques used in 1981 were rudimentary , and the Rios embryos are probably no longer viable . Moreover , many legal experts say that once the embryos are implanted , they lose any semblance of a claim to the Rios estate . Says Victoria Law Institute Spokesman Chris Wray : " A donor embryo does not belong to the donors of the genetic material but to the parents to whom the child is ultimately born .
