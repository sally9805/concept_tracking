The time was 1:10 p.m . Class was supposed to have ended . But the 35 juniors at the Jerusalem high school in Israel kept firing questions at two Arab guests , Walid Mula and Amal Rabi , both of them Israelis . " I do n't see how you can understand the Palestine Liberation Organization 's use of terror , " said one youngster . Replied Rabi : " I believe that the P.L.O . is the representative of the Palestinian people . O.K. , I am part of the Palestinian people . . . ( but ) I see myself as a citizen of Israel entitled to equal rights . " <P> " Why , " asked another student , " should I accept someone like you , who gives legitimacy to . . . the P.L.O . that wants to kill me ? " Remarkably , the debate contained no animus . When class ended , the students agreed that they had learned things they did not know before and that the session had helped Arab and Jew to know each other better . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new course in coexistence called " The Arab Citizens of Israel . " The study program is designed to help defuse the hatred between the nation 's 3.5 million Jews and 700,000 Arab citizens . When the course , built upon a text written by Alouph Hareven of the Van Leer Jerusalem Foundation , and two others , was initially tested on about 1,000 Jewish high schoolers in 1983-84 , hostility could hardly have been more intense . Six wars in 37 years have generated over 37,000 Israeli casualties and many more among Arabs . No Arab citizen has ever been a member of the Cabinet . Jews and Arabs , for the most part , have maintained separate housing , separate towns and separate schools . In this atmosphere , Jews perceive Arabs as unreliable , dirty and murderous . The Arab bigot 's image of Jews paints them as arrogant , moneygrubbing . Not surprisingly , the coexistence course was not immediately popular . One early session was interrupted with a pupil 's shout of " Take the Arabs out and kill them ! " <P> Gradually , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around first , moved by written accounts of personal hardship experienced by Israeli Arabs . " Some girls . . . related they had actually been unable to sleep after reading the text , " reported the teacher . Ultimately , both boys and girls conceded that the problem of Arab vs . Jew in Israel could no longer be ignored . <P> Of course , even the program 's supporters did not expect that Arab-Jewish hatred could be easily remedied . A poll of students last fall revealed that 60% of Jewish youngsters believed Arab citizens did not deserve full civil rights . Many Arab Israelis brush off the course as tokenism . " How can you teach coexistence . . . in the midst of conflict ? " asks one . <P> Nevertheless , the course has gained momentum : about 250 to 300 classrooms this past spring were alive with discussion among some 5,000 pupils . About 1,000 teachers and 700 student teachers have been trained in handling the course , with another 2,300 scheduled for training in the coming year . Additional materials are now in preparation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Jewish program has been prepared for introduction later this year . In October an Arab-Jewish television series modeled on a long-popular U.S. situation comedy , All in the Family , is tentatively scheduled to come out over the Israel Broadcasting Authority , using ethnic differences as material for humor .
