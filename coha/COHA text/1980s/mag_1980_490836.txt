A REPORTER AT LARGE SHORTLY before noon on Friday , February 29th , Ronald . Reagan and his wife , Nancy , arrive at the airport just outside Sarasota , Flori  --  da . It is suddenly dawning on a lot of people , in the wake of his unexpected  --  ly thorough defeat of George Bush in New Hampshire earlier this week , that Reagan might in fact he the Republi  --  can Party 's nominee . Assumptions about what will happen in politics bloom and fade rapidly . And memories are short . For some time , it had been assumed that Reagan might well be the nomi  --  nee , because no one could figure out which candidate could stop him . Then it was assumed that he was too old , too blunder-prone , simply too improbable . Reagan could still make a big mistake and some candidacy could pull itself together to stop him , but as of this moment , as he arrives here in Flor  --  ida , neither has happened . Another as  --  sumption has been that if Reagan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain . That 's exactly what people thought when Reagan first ran for governor of California , in 1966. lie won by al  --  most a million votes , in a state that was heavily Democratic and whose Republican tradition was liberal to moderate , and he was reelected four years later by a half-mil  --  lion votes . He had a strong instinct for what would at  --  tract traditionally Demo  --  cratic blue-collar votes . Moreover , the great waves of national discontent have been moving in Reagan 's direction : discontent with inflation and with " big gov  --  ernment , " with our power  --  lessness in certain interna  --  tional situations , and with our lack of military supe  --  riority over the Soviet Un  --  ion . Reagan is at once a very familiar figure and a remote one , accessible and at the same time inacces  --  sible . And his campaign has been going through tur  --  moil : on the day of his New Hampshire triumph , he fired John Sears , his cam  --  paign manager , and two of Sears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spent two-thirds of the money allowed under the federal spending laws . Reagan has 1980 : KEAGAN been the object of a tactical and ideo  --  logical struggle among the people who would make him President . The ques  --  tion is where  --  or even who  --  he is in all this . Reagan has , of course , been the con  --  servatives ' beau ideal for years now ; he has a gift for speaking to what is both  --  ering them . He is the titular leader of that wing of the Republican Party which took over in 1964 and changed the Party 's politics and its culture : the East yielded power to the West ; large Eastern financial interests to small busi  --  nesses and shopkeepers in the South and Southwest ; Wasps to blue-collar workers and Catholics . The Reagan wing can also draw on young voters of the sort who once supported George Wallace . ( In 1968 , Wallace received twice as much support as Eugene Mc  --  Carthy among young voters . ) That wing of the Party forms Reagan 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with such a com  --  mitted following . In New Hampshire , the Reagan campaign took advantage of the fact that Bush 's image , if not his politics , made him appear to represent the old Eastern elite , and left in ruins Bush 's strategy of trying to bridge the great divide in the Party . Gerald Car  --  men , Reagan 's New Hampshire campaign manager , ran what approached a class war there . He told the Boston Globe , " There are more of us than there are of them . " One of Sears ' stratagems had been to try to soften the edges on Reagan 's conservative picture , on the theory that this would make Reagan more electable . That was the idea behind Reagan 's choos  --  ing Richard Schweiker as his running mate in 1976 and behind some of the early strategies for 1980 . The strug  --  gle over Sears ' role had gone on for some time , and Sears lost out for a number of reasons , only one of them ideological . Sears had insisted on too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Reagan camp , including some who had been closest to Reagan for many years . And , finally , Nancy Reagan turned on him . Sears was one of the few people able to tell Reagan that he should n't say certain things . Reagan 's natural inclination when he campaigns is to do what he is most comfortable with : say things that fire up his natural following . The prob  --  lem is that when he follows his inclina  --  tion to take the red-flag issues to the conservatives , the moderates see red flags . Sears was trying to prevent some of this ( One of the victors in the pow  --  er struggle told me that the strategy of keeping Reagan under wraps in Iowa , which has been attributed to Sears , was generally agreed on in the Reagan camp . ) But Reagan was not comfort  --  able in his cotton batting , and many of the faith  --  ful were feeling let down and were complaining to the Reagan camp . These people were useful allies to the Old Guard in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own in  --  stincts in the final days be  --  fore the New Hampshire primary . Afterward , he and those who supported such an approach felt vindi  --  cated . On the way from the Sarasota airport to his first stop , I have an interview with Reagan  --  the first of two today . I ask him if the description of him as perhaps the most conserva  --  tive major figure in this campaign is an accurate one . Talking to Reagan can be some  --  thing like grappling with a wet cake of soap . He is pleasant enough , and responsive , even garrulous , but he of  --  ten follows much the same script that he does onstage , and many of his an  --  swers slide away . Now he responds , " I have always deplored labels , because I do n't think they are fairly descriptive . Everybody has his own definition when they hear the word as to what they think that word means . I would just prefer to go on the specific issues and on the record of what I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ultraconservative that when I began , the state income tax in California began with the first two thousand dollars of a family 's earn  --  ings , and when I Ieft , it began with the first eight thousand dollars ? Or that almost instantly when I took office I called in the prison director and we introduced in California the conjugal visit ? " Reagan was , in fact , a more moder  --  ate governor of California than his campaign rhetoric would suggest . This is attributed at least in part to strong countervailing forces  --  the Democratic legislature , the state 's liberal traditions , and the strong professional state gov  --  ernment . One of his former opponents says , " He fought with the symbolic liberal institutions  --  the state-universi  --  ty system , welfare groups , Cesar Cha  --  vez  --  and on the rest he struck a bar  --  gain . " It has also been said that he was not a very energetic governor , particu  --  larly in his second term  --  that , he seemed bored Reagan is often de @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coping with the push and pull of politics . I ask Reagan where he thinks the idea that he is so conservative comes from , then , and wheth ? , er he would prefer that that were not the im  --  pression people had . " No , " he replies . " I suppose it 's conserva  --  tive to the extent that I do n't believe in big , centralized federal government . I believe that the federal gov  --  ernment has attempted to do far too many things  --  that there are federal programs that should be returned to the states , along with the tax resources to pay for them . I believe that the federal government is too interventionist . I believe in the free mar  --  ketplace . " In his 1976 campaign , Reagan got into some difficulty by proposing that the federal government return ninety billion dollars ' worth of pro  --  grams to the states , to be continued there or not , and only lat er amended that to say that the taxes to pay for the programs would also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what , other than a saving in over  --  head , his transfer of programs to the states would accomplish , he talks about the diversity of the nation and sug  --  gests that mayors should have more discretion in the use of federal funds . When I ask him if he thinks there should be federal standards to require certain equities on the part of the state and local governments , Reagan replies , " There are areas that properly belong to the federal government . For exam  --  ple , I have no quarrel with there being a federal Food and Drug Administra  --  tion . It began around the turn of the century , when we lost a great many people  --  as a matter of fact , soldiers in the Spanish-American War through poisoned canned meat . That 's fine . Government exists to protect us from each other . But as the years have gone on and the bureaucracy grows , as bu  --  reaucracies do , we find that they have gone far beyond protecting us from poisonous or harmful substances , and they have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they will tell us what medicines are effective . " And then he gives what he obviously feels to he an absurd example . This is a standard Reagan technique  --  the ridic  --  ulous example , sometimes of dubious origin or accuracy . We begin to talk about Reagan 's anti-inflation program but , having arrived at the first stop , agree to resume later , IN Sarasota , Reagan is holding a " press availability " beside Sarasota Bay , just outside the hall where there will be a rally later . The sky is clear , and the scene is a lovely one and will look good on television . A large num  --  ber of Republicans -- the highest con  --  centration in the state  --  are clustered in the Gulf Coast area of Florida that Reagan will cover today . The only problem with this setting is that occa  --  sionally Reagan 's answers to questions are drowned out by a powerboat or an airplane . Nancy Reagan stands be  --  side him , looking , as she always does , perfect  --  relentlessly neat and com  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of fixed adoration . She is wear  --  ing a bright-pink Adolfo knit suit , a fuchsia blouse , and pumps that blend with the blouse . Mrs. Reagan 's fixed stare can give the impression that that is all there is to her , but this is definite  --  ly not the case ; she is a true conserva  --  tive believer , an influence on her hus  --  band , and a power in the campaign . The Reagans are obviously very close , and are frequently seen holding hands . Reagan is wearing a Hut-gray tweed suit , just short of flashy , with double vents ; is white handkerchief is folded in his breast pocket . Just as George Bush looks Eastern and John Connally looks Texan , Ronald Rea  --  gan looks Western . Reagan is asked his reac  --  tion to the recently renewed rumors that Gerald Ford might enter the race . " Well , what can I say " he replies . " The race is open to anyone who wants to enter . " He is asked whether he thinks that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Reagan smiles , and replies , " It was the last time . " ( Still , Ford was the in  --  cumbent , and had used the incum  --  bency , and Reagan went into the Re  --  publican Convention with just eighty fewer delegates than were committed to Ford . ) He says that Ford had told him that he would not enter the pri  --  maries but that if the Convention was deadlocked he would answer a draft . Reagan continues , " That 's the only word I 've had , and that was directly from him . " He is asked about a statement he made in the course of a debate with Republican opponents in South Carolina last night to the effect that marijuana is the most dangerous drug in America . He says that what he said was that a great many scientific people have come to the conclusion that it is one of the most dangerous drugs , and that one of the latest findings is that " a mari  --  juana cigarette probably is several times the cancer hazard for lung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A reporter remarks that a person does n't have to smoke as many mari  --  juana cigarettes to get the desired ef  --  fect . Nancy Reagan pokes her husband and whispers , " You would n't know . " Ronald Reagan says , " I would n't know . " A reporter points out that this is the hundred-and-eighteenth day that the hostages have been held in Iran , and asks Reagan whether he would have handled the matter differently . Reagan says that the Administration apparently believed that when the United Nations commission to investi  --  gate Iranian grievances was established the hostages would be released , and that then more concessions were de  --  manded . He says , " And each time our government has taken up the nego  --  tiating of those additional salami slices . And I believe once you think you have made a deal you have to say to the captors , ' This is all you get . There are no further concessions to be made . ' If you do n't do that , as long as they have the hos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're grovelling on the ground . " He is asked if Iran could n't then just say that they would keep the hostages indefinitely , and he replies , " Well , there comes the time when a government has got to be willing to set a date for their release and let them know privately what the option will be if they are not released as of that date . " He is asked if our government could do that now . He says , " I think we should have done it back about the end of the first or second week that they were held . " After this press conference , the Rea  --  gans will attend a fund-raising brunch , and Reagan will give an interview to a local radio station , which has carried his syndicated three-minute weekday to as a " dialogue . " The brevity of the remarks relieves him of the burden of developing a thought at any length , and the question-and-answer session enables him at once to seem accessible to " the people " and to turn the situa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ index cards , sometimes not . He has his lines down well by now . Today , he begins with a couple of audience-warming jokes and then says that Carter took what he himself had described as " minor crises " when he took office  --  inflation and energy  --  and turned them into " major disasters . " Reagan 's solution for inflation is bal  --  ancing the budget and cutting taxes by a third over three years ( this is a version of the Kemp-Roth proposals that have been floating around in Con  --  congress ) and reducing regulation of busi  --  ness . He says , " General Motors has to employ twenty-three thousand three hundred full-time employees just to fill out government paperwork and com  --  ply with government regulations . " The audience gasps . ( Like several Reagan examples , this one is technically accurate but gives a misleading im  --  pression . Actually , according to Gen  --  eral Motors , about twenty-four thou  --  sand eight hundred of its employees work full time at complying with fed  --  eral , state , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ workers involved in engineering work on pollu  --  tion-control , fuel-economy , and safety standards and on regulation of plant facilities  --  air- and water-pollution standards and safety standards . Even according to the company , about five thousand  --  out of more than five hun  --  dred thousand  --  General Motors em  --  ployees are involved in government " paperwork , " which includes such sub  --  jects as taxes . ) Reagan says , " Balanc  --  ing the budget is like protecting your virtue : all you have to do is learn to say no . " In propounding his ma cuts , he employs a curious mixture of liberal Democratic and conservative Republi  --  can thought . He points out  --  as Demo  --  crats did against Gerald Ford  --  that each percentage-point increase in un  --  employment costs twenty billion dol  --  lars , mainly in unemployment compen  --  sation and lost tax revenues . Harking back to the sort of Keynesian eco  --  nomics that most Republicans deplore , he points out that a tax cut proposed by John Kennedy and enacted in 1964 stimulated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was employed to stimu  --  late a sluggish economy , whereas re  --  cently the problem has been that the economy is overheated . Therefore , un  --  less Reagan is contemplating making cuts in government spending in com  --  bination with his tax cuts ( as the latest version of Kemp-Roth proposes ) ? and he does not mention this  --  what he suggests is , by most reckonings , infla  --  tionary . He says that the President says , " The good days in America are Over . " Waving toward the high-school hand behind him , Reagan says , " I want to believe that someday these young people back here can know the same freedom that we knew in this country when we were their age . " The audience applauds and cheers . As for energy , he says , " They say , Turn down the thermostat , drive less , or do n't drive at all . ' " He says that there was no energy problem " from the days of the horseless carnage until 1971 , " and that " from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  ty and skyrocketing prices . " And lie says , " Well , the simple difference is in 1971 the government injected itself into the energy industry . " He asks , " Is it too difficult to suggest that we go hack to what we were doing for sev  --  enty-one years and set the oil industry loose ? " ( The Nixon Administration imposed price controls on oil in 1971 , as part of its total wage-price freeze , and kept them on oil when the other controls were removed ; it imposed controls on allocations of oil in 1973 , during the Arab embargo . Reagan is correct in saying that the system by which the government allocates refin  --  ery products , which is scheduled to expire in 1981 , has led to distortions in distribution ; the Carter Administration is phasing out controls on the price of oil . ) Reagan suggests that there really is no energy problem . " Two-thirds of the oil is still down there ... but goy-eminent wo n't let them charge the price . " It is true that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one-third of the oil in the ground ; the rest has been considered too expensive to recover . No one knows how much will be recovered once price controls are removed . Reagan says , as he often does in his appearances , that " the oil geologists in this country , the leading men , have told me that there is more oil yet to be found than we have taken out of the ground . " He says , " The U.S. Geological Survey says that the potential for Alaska alone is greater than the proven reserves of Saudi Arabia . And yet our government has taken two hundred and fifty thousand square miles of Alaska and has said , That 's a preserve , you can not even look at that to find out if there 's oil underneath that ground . ' " ( The United States Geological Survey esti mates that Alaska has proven reserves of slightly over nine billion barrels of oil and potential reserves of between twelve and forty-nine billion addition  --  al barrels , while Saudi Arabia has prov  --  en reserves of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  leum Institute estimates that if all the potential oil in the United States  --  on  --  shore , offshore , in Alaska  --  were re  --  covered , production would increase by four million barrels a day ; currently , the United States imports eight mil  --  lion barrels a day . ) Reagan criticizes the Carter Admin  --  istration for having held up the devel  --  opment or deployment of various weapons , and says , " Today , we are not equal to the Soviet Union , and that is why they were able to cross into Af  --  ghanistan . " ( The United States had vast strategic superiority over the Soviet Union when Soviet troops went into Hungary , not long after the Eisenhow  --  er Administration had enunciated a policy of " massive retaliation , " and the United States still held a clear lead when the Soviets invaded Czechoslo  --  vakia twelve years later . ) " We have be  --  trayed our friends and appeased our ene  --  mies , " he says . Then he says , " There will he no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheers . When Reagan says that he will take questions , he says that he will take them mainly from people close to the stage  --  there are several indications that he is hard of hearing . In answers to questions , he says that he is against a peacetime draft , for equal rights but against the Equal Rights Amendment . lie says that the E.R.A. would put the issue in the courts " that have given us forced bus  --  ing and some of the other decisions with regard to crime that we have . " A woman asks how and when we will stop helping the Soviet Union  --  Reagan has said we 're still providing the Russians with technology that can he used for military purposes  --  and he replies , " When we get some people in the State Department who recognize that the Soviet Union is embarked on a goal that they have never retreated from , and that is to communize the en  --  tire world , and maybe then we 'll stop helping them destroy us . " He is asked about his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States , Canada , and Mex  --  ico , and he gives a vague answer . This idea was offered at the beginning of his campaign , but he could n't explain it very well and then it largely disap  --  peared . He closes by saying that as governor George Wallace or Spiro Agnew did . Of course , some of the social issues they played upon have died away . Still , in his way , Reagan does strike several of the same chords . When he does , it does not come across as mean , because Reagan does not come across as a mean man . With him , it comes across smoothly . As he was in 1976 , he is the candidate of indignation . And now he has added the politics of nostalgia . With him , he is saying , we can go hack to the days when things were simpler . He offers simple answers . Reagan has a certain plausibility when he does this , because he is himself a figure of nostal  --  gia . Reagan can talk all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but he evokes , deliberately , it seems , the Hollywood myth : of John Wayne or Jimmy Stewart  --  or Ron  --  ald Reagan  --  riding into town and set  --  ting things right . MID-AFTERNOON . Reagan addresses a large crowd in an indoor shopping mall . Red-white-and-blue bunting adorns the platform , and little Cub Scouts holding little American flags stand in front of it . He says , " There are many of us in this crowd who can remember not too many years ago when no country on earth would have even dared take fifty Americans hostage and hold them for a hundred and eighteen days , " and he receives big cheers . He says , " ' We have a group of elitists in Washington who have no more faith and trust in the American people , and they think they must con  --  trol our destiny , make all the rules , tell us how to run our lives and our businesses . And it is time to have a President who will take the govern  --  ment off the people 's backs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ple loose once again . " He gets Pakistan and Afghanistan mixed up , and admits to the crowd that he does that some  --  times . He says that if we just let the oil companies drill away , " we 'll be back where we were and happy again . " If Reagan is right about the energy prob  --  lem , an awful lot of people are terribly wrong . This time , he ends by waving his arm toward the Cuh Scouts  --  young people are among his props  --  and saying that we want the kind of country in which " these young people will know the freedom that we knew when we were their age . " TN an interview with Reagan on the way to the next stop , I begin by asking him about his anti-inflation pro  --  gram . ( Reagan assiduously waves to everyone along his route . I hesitated to begin the interviewing until we had pulled away from the shopping mall and his waving had subsided , but Rea  --  gan urged me to proceed . " Go ahead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same time . " ) When I asked him in our ear  --  lier conversation how he knew that his proposed tax cut would not increase the deficit , he cited the example of the Kennedy tax cut , drawing on material used by Congressman Jack Kemp , Re  --  publican of New York , and Senator William Roth , Republican of Dela  --  ware , to make their point . Some econo  --  mists argue that , aside from the fact that the Kennedy tax cut was aimed at a slow economy , the cut was only one factor that led to increased revenue ; another was that our participation in Vietnam was beginning to build . Rea  --  gan also said to me then that the result of the recent cut in taxes on capital gains is that " in the very first year the govern  --  ment ended up getting more revenue at the lower rate than they did at the higher . " However , the cut was enact  --  ed in 1978 , and since the tax returns for 1979 are not yet in , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ original version , the Kemp-Roth plan was simply to cut personal-income-tax rates by approxi  --  mately one-third ; the theory was that it would not increase the deficit , be  --  cause it would stimulate the economy enough to pay for itself , and that it would not be inflationary , because by encouraging people to work and invest more it would increase supply enough to satisfy the increased demand ( the " Laffer curve " ) . Few economists agreed ; and when Republicans went about the country during the 1978 con  --  gressional campaign promoting the idea , the public did n't buy it . The Re  --  publicans then regrouped , and rede ? signed the concept so that it combined the tax cuts with cuts in government spending , and a second Kemp-Roth proposal was introduced in January , 1979 . But when I now ask Reagan if , when he talks about cutting taxes by one-third over three years , he is also talking about making equivalent cuts in government spending , he says that he is not , and he goes on to use ex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the original Kemp-Roth proposal . These days , Re  --  publicans in Congress , including Roth , are not talking much about even the revised proposal ; their emphasis is on budget cuts , not tax cuts . Kemp says that he and Reagan , whom he has been advising , put a higher priority on cutting taxes and that this is what separates Reagan from what Kemp terms the " Eisenhower-Nixon  --  Ford-Bush " Republican economic or  --  thodoxy . I refer to Reagan 's comments about Iran this morning and ask him what kind of " option " he thinks might be effective . He replies , " Well , this is the thing that all of us on our side have refused to speculate on , for two reasons . That , you see , should be done in private . You do n't want to suggest something that might be in the planning and you louse it up , or you do n't want to be in the position of telling in advance what you 're going to do . But you also do n't want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I would have to be in the position to sit there with the National Security Council or with the Joint Chiefs of Staff and say , ' All right , now , what are all the things that are possible ? ' " He says he understands that the sort of raid the Israelis staged at Entebbe would not he possible . " But what we 're talking about is what if there were some pressure points that Iran ca n't stand ? A blockade of their ports , or a mining of their ports ? whatever . I 'm only saying these are Examples of all the types of things you would explore . I think for a long time we 've made the mistake of telling ene mies and potential enemies what we wo n't do . If you remember , Lyndon Johnson was frequently asked , ' Would we use nuclear weapons in the Viet nam War ? ' And no one wants to use nuclear weapons . But Lyndon John son would say , No , under no circum stances would we ever use nuclear weapons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go to bed every night wondering whether you will . You only have to go hack to the Korean War , when Eisenhower was elected Presi  --  dent . There were many appeals for armistice talks , and Ike , as a new Pres  --  ident , said , ' I 'm going to review our potential with regard to the use of weapons , ' and made it very plain what he was talking about . And almost in  --  stantly the North Vietnamese agreed to the Panmunjom talks . " " You mean the North Koreans ? " " The North Koreans . " I ask Reagan what he meant when he said at an earlier rally that there should be " no more Vietnams . " " What I meant by that was never again must this country ever ask young men to tight and die in a war we 're afraid to let them win . " He tells me a story he says a Vietnam veteran told him the other day about being fired at by people dressed as Buddhist monks and having to get permission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you would n't have gone in or that we should have gone in and fought it in a way to win ? " " I was one who never believed we should have gone in , " he says . " I 've always believed in the MacArthur dic  --  tum that you do n't get involved in a land war in Asia . But the troops were sent in ; once we sent them in , then you have made a commitment to the men you 're asking to fight that you are go  --  ing to give them every resource to win this thing and get them home as soon as possi  --  ble . And that 's where the difference lay ! ' I ask Reagan if he thinks we can regain military superiority over the Soviet Union . " Yes , " Reagan re  --  plies . " I think the Soviet Union is probably at the very limit of its military output . ft has already had to keep its people from having so many consumer goods . Instead , they 're devoting it all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great  --  est military buildup the world has ever seen . I think it tops what Hitler did . And therefore , when people talk about an arms race , this does n't mean that the Soviet Union escalate to twice what they 're doing now . We 're the ones who have actually played along with the treaties and , if anything , actually reduced our weapons . " He continues , " Now , what I think the Russians would fear more than anything else is a United States that all of a sudden would hitch up our belt and say , ' O.K. , Buster , we 've tried this other way . We are now going to build what is neces  --  sary to surpass you . ' And this is the last thing they want from us , an arms race , because they are already running as fast as they can and we have n't started running . " " Where are you going to get the money to pay for this military buildn up. ; " Out of the economy . " When Reagan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the fact that a high percentage of So  --  viet bombers could get through to the United States  --  that sound alarming but are beside the point . Defense plan  --  ners , starting with the Nixon period , decided that the real issue was missiles , not bombers . When I ask him how he would work with the interest groups and institutions in Washington , Reagan says , " I know how hard it 's going to he , because , again , I had a Democratic legislature . But I also found that in many instances in the major things do n't do this with the little things  --  you work with them , you try to work with them , you com  --  promise , you get as much as you can get . In other words , I 'll settle for half a loaf and try for the second half la  --  ter . But On the major things I took the case to the people , and sometimes it is neces  --  sary to make the leg  --  islature see the light , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got our welfare re form . They held out for months  --  in fact , they refused to allow me to present the wel  --  fare reform to a joint session of the legisla  --  ture . That was like banning a book in Bos  --  ton  --  that made me a best-seller . Everybody wanted to hear the speech they would n't listen to . One day , the leader of the opposition came into my office with his hands above his head , smiling , and he said , ' Stop those cards and letters ! He sat down , and we negotiated out the welfare reform . " Going back to where I began with him , I ask him how , since he is seen as a conservative , he would broaden his base so as to be able to govern Again , he refers to California , point MARCH 24,1980 ing out that he won by a million votes in a state that was heavily Democratic . He continues , " And I think the same thing is evident here . In New Hamp  --  shire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ polling place to ask them who they vote for . Well , the oth  --  er night I was watching that , and I saw that , contrary to the usual Republican country-club , big-business image . they were finding that the more affluent had voted for Bush , and I had the working people . And I think this has always been true . That 's what I had in California . " " And this could happen nation  --  ally ? " " I think so , because I think there are millions of Democrats who may not call themselves conservatives , but they 've come to realize the federal government 's big social solutions just do n't work . " We arrive at Sun City Center , a re  --  tirement community , almost forty-five minutes late ; another large crowd has gathered to await him . Reagan is elated . " Oh , boy , they 're here , are n't they ? " he says as he starts waving . EAGAN , once more surrounded by red , white , and blue , tells the Sun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caused by government , and gov  --  ernment can make it go away . It 's as simple as that . " He talks of the hos  --  tages held in Iran and of the American Ambassador being held hostage in Co  --  lombia , and says , " Since 1968 , there have been sixty-three assassinations of American diplomatic personnel or non-diplomatic but Americans internation  --  ally by terrorist groups . " He talks of ninety-some kidnappings , six hundred and some bombings . He says , " All of these things have happened to a United States that most of you can remember , as I do remember , a United States that even where an American was on busi  --  ness , or on vacation , or wherever , and got caught in some little country that Was having a revolution , or got caught in a war , all that the American had to do was pin to his lapel a little Ameri  --  can flag and he could walk right through that war and nobody would lay a finger on him . Well , I want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He is cheered . Asked about whether the Shah should have been allowed into this country , he says , " I do n't think there would have been a necessity to admit him into this country . Had the right Administration been there or done what was right , the United States would not have pulled the rug out from a thirty-seven-year ally . " About the allegations of torture during the Shah 's regime , Reagan says , " Is it any different than what Algeria is doing ? Is it any different than what Iraq is doing ? There arc different parts of the world with different customs than ours . " He says that he and Nancy had lunch with the Shah in Teheran , and explains that the Shah 's major problem was that he was trying to modernize Iran and he divided up the land ; he says that the Shah gave away his own land , and that " the mullahs were the other big landowners  --  maybe that 's one of the reasons why they 're mad at him . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he closes with : " I would like nothing better than to be the leader of this country , a leader whose idea was to remove the shackles and the roadblocks that hold down this great people by government and turn the genius of America once again to he the great country that we were . " TAMPA . Reagan has attended a fund-raiser and given a television interview , and is now speaking at his last rally of the day , at the Holiday Inn . More red , white , and hlue . An  --  other band . Before Reagan arrived , a master of ceremonies explained to the audience that since " this is a media event , " the people with Reagan posters should be down front , in sight of the cameras . At these events , the posters face the cameras , not Reagan . The day has been a long one , Leaving the im  --  pression that no one is to question the man 's stamina . Stamina aside , there is , for all the nice-guy , easy demeanor , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he can be a very determined man should have been overcome four years ago . And his recent victory and the adulation of the crowds have helped propel him along . Reagan does not disappoint his audi  --  ences , nor they him . As the day has gone on , he has said many of the same things , but he also seems to have drawn closer and closer to his old self . Tonight , he suggests that " we re-implement the Tenth Article of the Bill of Rights -- that part of the Con  --  stitution that says the federal govern  --  ment shall do only those things specif  --  ically called for in the Constitution , " and he receives huge applause . He asks , " Is n't it time now that we deliver a message to the world that this great in  --  dustrial giant here is going to rebuild its military forces to the point that there will he no country on earth ... " and his conclusion is drowned Out as the audience stands and cheers . It stands and cheers again when , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his most effective ones in 1976 , he says , " Yes , if we can get the federal government out of the classroom , maybe we can get God back in . " He says that he wants to be President not so that he can hear " Hail to the Chief " and not for the perquisites . But , he says , " I do hunger for that job , because I believe that with the experience I 've had I could turn once again to the people of this coun  --  try and help remove the shackles and the roadblocks that government has put on the people of this country and once again unleash the great power of the American people to go forward . .. " and once more his words are drowned in cheers . ? ELIZABETH DREW
