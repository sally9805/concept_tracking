Ronald Reagan , self-proclaimed enemy of Washington 's bloated bureaucracy , came into office eight years ago vowing to dismantle Jimmy Carter 's two additions to the Cabinet , the departments of Education and Energy . He has not only failed to scale back the Cabinet , but is also on the verge of expanding it . This week the President is expected to sign legislation elevating the Veterans Administration to a Cabinet-level department . That will bring the number of Cabinet departments to 14 . <P> There was an election year timeliness to Reagan 's turnaround and Congress 's overwhelming support for the new Cabinet post . In their frenzy to appeal to 27.5 million U.S. veterans , the politicians seem unconcerned that the cost of transforming the V.A . into a Cabinet department will be $9.9 million . The biggest chunk of that cost will go to changing signs on the 532 V.A . buildings .
