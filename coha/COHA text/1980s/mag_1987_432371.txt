 | For two years , the nation has been rocked by one major spy scandal after another : The Walker family plunders secrets under the Navy 's nose , the Pollards snoop on America for Israel , a hard-drinking CIA rogue officer outwits his would-be FBI captors . Now , an equally grave Moscow embarrassment is raising the specter of a worldwide U.S. embassysecurity crisis . With cases rapidly piling up ? and these are only a sampler ? Washington has come face to face with the painful reality of chaos in its counterintelligence apparatus . Complacency factor Until now , the guardians of America 's secrets have mostly insisted that if the problem were serious , no spies would ever have been nabbed . But , in fact , cash-and-carry espionage by the likes of the Walkers and the others went unnoticed for years before lucky breaks finally triggered arrests . With the Moscow sex-for-secrets scandal expanding , the official attitude is far less sanguine . No one can plausibly deny any longer that the U.S. 's own complacency has left it highly vulnerable to prying enemy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a long time , " says Stansfield Turner , the former CIA director . " We 've had a distressing casualness toward the whole business of keeping an eye on suspicious Americans , and now we 're seeing the results . " Nothing underscores this laxness so much as the still unfolding embassy case . Two Marines who served as U.S. Embassy guards in Moscow stand accused of permitting Soviet KGB agents into top-secret areas after they were sexually entrapped by Russian women . A third Marine has been accused of improper fraternization with Russian women , and a fourth ? a former Leningrad sentry ? is being held for questioning . Last week , the Pentagon recalled The Marine spy scandal is just the latest U.S. intelligence fiasco , indicating deep-seated problems with no easy remedies four Marine guards from Vienna for possible Moscow-style violations . The U.S. has replaced all 28 guards in Moscow and is doing the same in Leningrad . Meantime , as pretrial proceedings resumed for Sgt. Clayton Lonetree , the first arrested , Naval Investigative Service gumshoes are busy quizzing 50 Marines in 20 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the embassy spying in Moscow could occur for so long without arousing suspicion . Why , for instance , did no one think it odd that two young Marines ? Lonetree and Cpl . Arnold Bracy ? would volunteer for dead-of-night shifts ? Why post them at their own request to the most secret areas ? Why permit them to remain when they made no attempt to disguise illicit friendships with Soviet women ? Just as important , why would fellow guards , despite ample reason to inform , stay mute ? The answer to the last question strikes at the very heart of the problem ? a refusal to accept , even in the face of mounting evidence , that Americans themselves pose one of the biggest spy threats . " We probably counted too heavily on the dynamic of a high-morale group reporting on each other , " admits Arthur Hartman , ambassador during Lonetree 's tour . " We thought if someone was going astray , other members would tell us . " Yet , incredibly , during more than 250 hours of guard school , Marines got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moral obligations in critically important overseas posts . Such official myopia is distressingly apparent in many of the cases . Among them : The 18 years of messages handed to Moscow by the Walker family spy ring , the thousand or more documents sold the Israelis by Jonathan Jay Pollard , the multibillion-dollar electronic-eavesdropping program compromised by Ronald Pelton , the description of CIA Moscow operations given the KGB by former officer Edward Lee Howard . Although differing in some respects , these cases have common threads ? specifically , the ease with which these turncoats almost cavalierly perused America 's top secrets , and the fact that their bizarre behavior signaled no red flags to U.S. counterspies . Pollard worked under an honor sys- temin which he was expected voluntarily to limit his top-secret access to data on possible Caribbean terrorism , yet he brazenly obtained baskets of sensitive Mideast information . While he repeatedly bragged to friends that he was an Israeli agent , security checks failed to spot him as a risk . John Walker 's preenlistment history of burglaries hardly seemed the sort of background that would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vessel . And no one questioned how Walker could pay for a sailboat and flying lessons . Only his estranged wife 's tip belatedly brought him to the attention of investigators . Pelton had severe money troubles and filed for bankruptcy while at the supersecret National Security Agency , later becoming a drug abuser after resigning . His January , 1980 , call to the Soviet Embassy was detected through a lawful wiretap , but he was n't caught until his KGB contact , Vitaly Yurchenko , defected five years later . Howard , too , had severe drinking and drug-abuse problems , and failed a polygraph test before being fired by the CIA in June , 1983 . Yet it appears that the CIA was unaware of his merchandising of secrets until Yurchenko tattled . Howard then slipped an FBI tail in September , 1985 , later turning up on Moscow television . Root causes The spying seems to have flourished because of two things ? a deeply ingrained attitude that Americans ought not spy on fellow citizens and a crippling lack of coordination among agencies sharing the counterespionage pie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most resistant to change . Senator Malcolm Wallop ( R-Wyo. ) , a member of the Select Committee on Intelligence , believes the paranoid Watergate-era spying created such fear of intrusion that many officials today shut Senator Wallop . He says problem is mainly one of attitude their eyes to the possibility of traitors in their midst . " You can not imagine a more benign environment for moles than that in which they ca n't be believed to exist , " he says . " What makes us think we have developed such a corner on morality that our people are not turnable ? " Others feel Secretary of State George Shultz compounded the problem by refusing to submit to a polygraph test required of all those cleared to see top-secret information . The feeling perceived by Wallop and given dramatic expression by Shultz has led virtually all federal agencies charged with responsibility for counterintelligence to treat it less than seriously . The FBI , the lead agency for domestic counterspying , is reported to have spent far less than Congress provided . One practical result is a shortage of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sources tell of a Sovietbloc spy who succeeded in fleeing the U.S. when incriminating statements could not be translated in time . Other branches have problems as well . At the National Security Agency , no one bears sole responsibility for counterespionage , and many operatives are guided by outdated theories . " They need to adjust . . . in the face of U.S. weaknesses that have become apparent in the 1980s , " says one longtime observer of the NSA . At the CIA , counterintelligence is still not a separate career track , which means agents do not always get the chance to develop expertise . At the State Department , the ticket to the top is diplomacy , not security . " One of their problems , " says a former CIA official , " is that a whiz kid has no interest in making embassies secure . He wants to wear striped pants . " Within the FBI , counterintelligence people are scornfully called " rusty guns . " Even with the long series of embarrassments , there is still virtually no coordination among agencies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several branches ? chiefly the CIA , FBI , Defense Intelligence Agency and the NSA ? is rare for a Western power . For good reason , almost all of America 's allies have single agencies doing counterspy work , such as Britain 's legendary MI-5 , France 's DST and Canada 's respected Intelligence and Security Service . " What we have is every agency carving out its own little area and no one bringing it together , " says a former CIA spook . " We 're trying to find out if the Kremlin can break message traffic , the NSA tries to decode traffic , the Pentagon to screen employes , the State Department to find bugs . No one pulls it together , and things fall through the cracks . " The pitfalls became obvious with Howard 's defection . When he left the CIA and moved to New Mexico , his old employer did n't inform FBI agents . By the time the FBI was ready to pounce , Howard had plotted an escape . Yet despite all the foul-ups , few experts recommend a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would take years to create and in the meantime might tempt those now handling the task to become less vigilant . Instead , a consensus favors a smaller bureau to coordinate available  | espionage data and make rules for both counterintelligence and security . Meanwhile , several preventive measures ? such as increased use of the polygraph ? seem possible . The Pentagon reported last week that it has begun weighing use of random tests on embassy guards as part of a general security shake-up . But the testing , already required of CIA employes , could be applied on a much broader scale . " It has proven one of the most effective deterrents and investigative tools , " said Kenneth Bass , a former Justice Department intelligence expert . " I would n't send people to jail on the basis of a polygraph , but I would remove them from sensitive security positions . " Years without checkups More frequent scrutiny of those with top-secret clearances also would cut exposure . With manpower in short supply , many workers go years without undergoing checks aimed at turning up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to personal weaknesses . " Most people are n't problems when cleared for the most sensitive secrets , and when he walks out the door , he 's the man who never was . Our greatest vulnerability is from people who have left . " A prime example : Walker , whose freespending ways and peripatetic travel might well have rung alarms had the Navy kept an eye on former top-secret workers . Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger said last week that the ring enabled Moscow to decipher more than a million secret messages ? " devastating , " he said , " in event of war . " But whatever measures are taken , experts agree that they must be applied without exception . Says Bass , the fora mer Justice Department lawyer : " NothY ing is more counterproductive than e , turning the screws on the career people and letting top policy people play by different rules . Of all the people who do n't believe in security , the people at the top are the worst . "           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
