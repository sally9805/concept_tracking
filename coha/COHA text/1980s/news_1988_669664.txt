Government foreign aid is growing at a healthy clip , more than $10 billion in this fiscal year ' s budget . And the Cabinet Tuesday decided to raise the aid target even higher , pledging to give more than $50 billion between now and 1992. // // Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita will take the new aid policy to the summit of Western leaders in Toronto later this week . Japan , he will likely say , is fulfilling its international responsibilities by becoming the world ' s leading aid donor. // But the focus on official development assistance tends to obscure the reality of how Japan ' s surplus is being recycled . Most of the surplus is in private hands . The vast majority of that money is flowing to the United States , Europe , and other industrial nations. // Loans to the third world from Japanese banks , whose total assets are the largest in the world , are actually shrinking . Japanese corporations are building factories in Indiana , not Peru : 83 percent of direct investment currently goes to advanced countries. // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ create a climate which will attract such investment . Even the Japanese bank that has lent the most to developing countries , the Bank of Tokyo , feels that way . ' ' Is it right to lend money to . . . overliving people ? ' ' asked Bank of Tokyo senior advisor Teruhiko Mano , speaking metaphorically . ' ' ( Developing countries ) have to restructure their economy. ' ' // The Japanese government has made some attempts to encourage a flow of private funds , mostly through loans to institutions like the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) . Its highly touted $30 billion recycling plan , announced in 1987 , is one such attempt . Still , in 1986 , Japan sent $131. 5 billion overseas but only $16. 2 billion went into developing countries . Later figures are not available , but a Ministry of Finance official says the pattern has continued. // So far , the Japanese are living up to their reputation as conservative and highly cautious investors . They are jokingly referred to by some as ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Japanese government and business officials say this is simply a matter of the free market at work . ' ' When we let the market forces play their full role , ' ' the Ministry of Finance official said blandly , ' ' the majority of funds will flow to the US and industrial countries where they offer more attractive returns. ' ' // Japanese financiers also indirectly blame the US for running a budget deficit , which is being financed in large part by Japanese purchases of US treasury bonds . The US is now the world ' s biggest debtor . ' ' If we concentrate on recycling to developing countries , you ' ll have to find other sources of money , ' ' Mr. Mano says. // The one exception to this pattern has been the rapid growth , a doubling last year , of direct investment in newly industrializing Asian countries . Manufacturers moving production offshore to avoid the impact of the high yen account for most of this increase . But that too is relatively ' ' safe ' ' investment. // In the 1970s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recycled to the developing sector as loans from large commercial banks in New York and elsewhere where the money was deposited . That huge debt - now some $1. 3 trillion - hangs over the world economy , threatening to upset the financial system , and strangling growth in indebted nations. // Japanese bankers say that experience has made them even more cautious about lending money to heavily indebted countries such as Mexico . But some Japanese economists argue that is very shortsighted policy . By providing a new infusion of capital , they say , banks and corporations can activate demand in developing countries , creating new markets for products from industrialized nations. // The dependence of Japan and newly industrialized countries such as Korea and Taiwan on the US market could then be reduced. // ' ' The Japanese ( trade ) surplus ( with the US ) is caused by the debt problem , ' ' argues Toshihisa Nagasaka , an official of the Japan External Trade Organization . ' ' We failed to develop markets in Latin America , the Middle East , and Africa. ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ major creditor banks ( including the Bank of Tokyo ) for emphasizing the sanctity of debt payments over the development needs of recipient countries . The debtor countries ' ' can not grow ' ' as long as they are ' ' under the severe control of the IMF and the bank advisory committee , ' ' says Yoh Kurosawa , Deputy President of the Industrial Bank of Japan. // ' ' Most of those countries have surplus in their trade balance , ' ' Mr. Kurosawa points out . ' ' We ( banks ) got all of their surplus to cover interest payments . Even that was not enough . We lent new money to cover the interest payments . That was wrong . Let them use their surplus to make their economies grow . . . Instead of doing that we have squeezed those countries. ' ' // There is some degree of self-interest in this stance . The Industrial Bank and other large Japanese banks have lent far less than have the large New York banks ( and the Bank of Tokyo ) . A plan presented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plans promoted by the US and the IMF call for large banks to contribute more lending to countries like Brazil and Mexico. // But Kurosawa says ' ' if we contribute to lending to those countries , it means we help New York money-center banks . . . which haven ' t done anything in the last six years ( to solve the problem ) . ' ' // Kurosawa favors a long-term delay in interest payments by indebted countries , for 20-30 years , until their economies are strong enough to repay the debt. // Japanese development experts also see the policies of the notably conservative Ministry of Finance as an obstacle . The ministry severely limits the amount that banks may place in tax-exempt loan-loss reserves , thereby restricting their ability to effectively write-off their bad loans . Compared to European banks which have written off up to 70 percent of those loans , Japanese banks are allowed to place only the equivalent of 10 percent of the loan value into such reserves. // Critics call on the government to reduce the risk of lending and investment by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overseas investment and trade , including not denying insurance eligibility to countries simply because they had their debts rescheduled . They also favor more government guarantees on lending , far more extensive than presently are carried out by the Export-Import Bank of Japan. // The Finance Ministry opposes using public funds to help the banks . The banks ' loans were ' ' made by their own decision , by their initiative , on their own responsibility , ' ' says the Finance Ministry official . ' ' How can you justify this to the taxpayer ? ' ' // The ministry also defends its emphasis on recycling funds through the IMF and similar institutions because they can ' ' exert some kind of pressure ' ' on developing countries to tighten their belts . Money is not the bottleneck for development , the official says . Developing countries ' ' have to sacrifice their standard of living today , ' ' he says . ' ' That is the key to development . We all went through the same process. ' ' // //       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
