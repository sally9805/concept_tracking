The Reagan Administration , already discomforted by New Zealand 's ban on visits by nuclear-armed vessels , has now bombed out with other allies . William Arkin , a nuclear-policy researcher at the Washington-based Institute for Policy Studies , leaked a Defense Department contingency plan to station nuclear weapons in seven foreign countries and Puerto Rico if a war seemed imminent . The proposed deployment caused a stir in Canada , Iceland and Bermuda , and would violate a U.S. guarantee not to send nuclear weapons to Puerto Rico . It was not clear if the U.S. had notified any of the countries involved . <P> The leaked document says that nuclear weapons would also be shipped to Spain , the Philippines , Portugal 's Azores and the British island of Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean . According to Arkin , the weapons are ten-kiloton nuclear depth charges that would be dropped from P-3C Orion planes . The State Department last week asked its embassies to emphasize that no nuclear weapons would be shipped to any country without its permission .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
