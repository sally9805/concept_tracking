" This country has a ship it can be real proud of , " says Mr. Adkinson , who is 44 years old and has spent the last several months helping refit the World War II battleship for sea duty . " Working on her was like working with American history. " // On Saturday , Vice President Bush is to preside at a Navy ceremony here to formally recommission the Iowa , which is to leave on Monday. // Many of those who will attend the ceremony at the Ingalls shipyard will be residents of Pascagoula , one of several communities along the Mississippi Gulf Coast that are currently benefiting from a surge in military spending . Economic fortunes in the region historically reflect arms outlays. // With the Reagan Administration committed to a $1 , 500 billion military buildup , times are looking better in Pascagoula than they have in years . Largely because of the work on the Iowa , employment at Ingalls , the biggest private employer in the state , reached 10 , 500 earlier this year. // It is expected to climb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a direct result of efforts to expand the American fleet to 600 ships . In addition to refitting the Iowa , the company has contracts to deliver 11 guided-missile cruisers to the Navy . This summer workers here will also begin to cut steel on the first of a new generation of 40 , 000-ton amphibious assault ships. // " Things are just looking brighter and brighter , " said Roy O ' Bryant , Mayor of this city of 29 , 000 people . " After all , Ingalls accounts for more than 30 percent of our entire local economy. " // A recent survey by the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that workers in Pascagoula made an average of $18 , 400 a year , the highest average in the Southeast. // Military spending is important not only in Pascagoula but also all along the Mississippi Gulf Coast , where long stretches of tourist motels and garish souvenir shops crowd against a narrow ribbon of beach that local boosters like to refer to " America ' s Riviera . " <> <> Bases Along the Gulf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the Navy Construction Battalion at Gulfport , home to 3 , 900 sailors as well as the largest Seabee base in the country . Farther to the west , on Bay St. Louis , the Army has recently completed a $500 million munitions center to produce antitank artillery shells. // The plant is part of 200-square-mile former missile test site that also includes two Navy oceangraphic research facilities. // But the largest single facility is Keesler Air Force Base in Biloxi , which is the Air Force ' s training center for computers and electronics . At any one time , there are more than 13 , 000 military personnel assigned to the base , making it the second largest installation of its kind in the service. // Along with nearly 4 , 000 civilian employees , the base has a weekly payroll of more than $5 million and , by Air Force estimates , pumps about $429 million a year into the Gulf Coast economy . That includes spending from some 4 , 000 retired Air Force personnel who live near the base. // " Without Keesler , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recession , " said J. Michael Chance , executive vice president of the Biloxi Chamber of Commerce , who describes military spending and tourism as the pillars of the local economy . <> <> Role of Stennis Credited // // Like others here , Mr. Chance gives most of the credit for the Gulf Coast ' s good fortune to John C. Stennis , the 83- year-old senior Senator from Mississippi whose used his longtime role on Senate Armed Services Committee to insure that his state always got its share of the military dollar. // But these days , people are not forgetting President Reagan either . " He ' s pretty popular around here all right , " said Ed L. Lowe , a trade union leader who was elected last month as a Democratic national convention delegate on behalf of Walter F. Mondale. // The Gulf Coast of Mississippi has long been a Republican stronghold in what is otherwise a very Democratic state . The district ' s Congressman , Trent Lott , is a Republican who has won election easily every two years since first gaining the seat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spending here , the Gulf Coast economy is still unpredictable . Unemployment in Jackson County , which includes Pascagoula , still hovers around 15 percent , although that is down from nearly 24 percent a year ago. // In part , that is because the local economy has never quite recovered from the major cutbacks at the Ingalls yard in the late 1970 ' s , when more than 25 , 000 workers were employed . <> <> Most Prolific Naval Contractor // // Leonard Erb , who is the president of Ingalls , a division of Litton Industries , says employment will never reach those levels again , although it could get as high as 16 , 000 if the company is successful in bidding for work on a new generation of destroyers the Navy wants to build. // Ingalls , one of four major shipbuilders for the Navy , has been the most prolific naval contractor over the last decade , turning out 42 new ships. // That does not include the work on the Iowa , which involved reconditioning and refitting the battleship so it can lead a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It had spent nearly 25 years in moth balls at a Philadelphia shipyard. // The work on the sleek , 887-foot-long battleship , which was built in the Brooklyn Navy Yard , is described as a labor of love among many of the workers . " It ' s been a privilege and an honor to work on this ship , " said Larry Crisco , a 46-year-old metal worker. // Indeed , Mr. Crisco was so moved by the ship that he wrote a poem that reads , in part : **28;1046; For we have given her new life From the grave yard , where she did <> // lay With hard work from so many And long hours every day. //
