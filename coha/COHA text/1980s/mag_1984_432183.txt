It has long been a paradox of pregnancy : just as they 're approaching motherhood , grown women tend to dress like little girls . For years they had no choice , since stores offered only puffed sleeves , Peter Pan collars and Bo Peep pastels that were better suited to a layette than an adult wardrobe . But with a baby boomlet under way and nearly half of all expectant mothers holding down jobs , designers are delivering sophisticated maternity styles at last . Natural fibers no longer seem as rare as quintuplets , and working mothers-to-be can finally fit into the business world even when they do n't fit into their regular clothes . Maternity chic was born of necessity . " Years ago the average pregnant woman was younger and stayed at home , " says Harold Starkman , the president of Stern Made , a veteran manufacturer of maternity wear that now holds the licenses for two of today 's most elegant lines , Regina Kravitz and Belle France . " She wanted something cute to wear while she was waiting ; now she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affluent firsttime mothers have turned around the maternity market with their demand for good-looking , good-quality clothes . Many professionals want maternity versions of the man-tailored ensembles that they believe best suit them for success ? to the profit of companies like Mothers Work , a national chain that makes and sells its own clothes . " If a pregnant woman dresses in ruffles , she loses ground , " says Linda Davis , founder of Dress for Success , a Detroit-based catalog firm . " You have to show that it 's business as usual . " For pregnant women who find dressing like a man little better than dressing like an infant , designers have produced another revolutionary idea : outfits that are dignified but not masculine , feminine but not frilly . Clothes , in short , that except for extra fullness could be worn by any stylish adult ? like those of Diana , Princess of Wales , who seems to be as influential in pregnancy as she was in her wedding gown . " There is no reason to compromise fashion just because you 're having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an early purveyor of updated maternity looks . Flaunt It ' : These days the expectant woman can find something stylish for the office , the gym or an evening out . There are pure-wool cuffed pants , low-slung cottonjersey dresses , sexy gowns and even jogging suits ? simply writ large . Still , there are alterations . Designer Suzanne Eliastam , of Toujours Belle , who has outfitted such royal ladies-in-waiting as Diana and Princess Caroline of Monaco , has cut her regular line of affordable , extraordinarily pretty clothes to allow for size adjustment during pregnancy and discreet nursing afterward . Many future moms are even wearing " bubble " dresses that are banded underneath to accentuate the stomach . " Detail used to be placed around the neck to draw the eye to the face , " says Melinda Griffin , coowner of Kangaroo Pouch in Atlanta . " But now it 's If you 've got it flaunt it ' .

Odds are slim , however , that even the most accommodating of regular clothes will provide full-term coverage . " After about the fifth month , they start to look silly , " says leading maternity designer Judy Loeb of Sweet Mama . And why should anyone do that , now that maternity clothes are finally fulfilling great expectations ? @#
