Winter Olympics <P> To the Editors : <P> It does not matter whether the U.S. shines in the Winter Olympics at Sarajevo Jan. 30 . Even if we fail to win a gold medal , which is highly unlikely , I am proud of our athletes . <P> Kevin J. Harris <P> Clarence , N. Y. <P> Your portrayal of America 's Olympic athletes is as inspiring as the Games themselves . The lives and abilities of these talented people should make us proud that they are representing the U.S. <P> Nina Chien <P> New York City <P> As the parent of young speed skaters , I was angered by your comment that speed skating is an obscure sport and " Heiden , the greatest speed skater in history-and an American-has flashed through without leaving a trace . " Eric Heiden chose to excel in a sport that demands grace and strength , instead of one like hockey , which can be brutal and violent . I am proud that my children chose to emulate him . <P> Judy Feldman <P> Glenview , Ill . <P> Four years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ press continues to snipe at us . In your report on the Sarajevo Games , almost every adjective or phrase you use in referring to Lake Placid has a negative or derogatory connotation . We may have done some things imperfectly that winter , but we did a lot that was right . <P> Ruth P. Hart <P> Lake Placid , N. Y. <P> In your historical review of Sarajevo , you say that Bosnia and Herzegovina were annexed by the Hapsburg Austro-Hungarian empire in 1878 . At the Congress of Berlin in that year , Bosnia-Herzegovina was placed under Austro-Hungarian authority by the European powers but technically remained Turkish until the region was annexed outright by the Hapsburgs in 1908 . <P> Edward F. von Briesen <P> Oyster Bay Cove , N. Y. <P> Argentina 's " Dirty War " <P> Your articles on the arrest of Argentina 's former military leaders Jan. 23 are not evenhanded . The left-wing terrorists , not the generals , started the dirty war . As a cousin of mine who is among the disappeared ones told me the last time we met , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a more just one . " His politics led to acts as despicable as those used by the military . Because the generals won that war , we have democracy today in Argentina . <P> Ezequiel Fernandez <P> Buenos Aires <P> Now that Argentina has leaders who want to govern in their citizens ' interest , I see hope for that country . Maybe the junta 's disastrous invasion of the Falkland Islands was a blessing in disguise . <P> Douglas A. Johnson <P> Georgetown , Mass . <P> Argentina would not be electing its leaders today had the leftist guerrillas defeated the " barbarous " and " repressive " military regime in the dirty war . <P> John Stuewer <P> Madison , Wis . <P> Justice , Chinese Style <P> The Chinese crackdown on criminals Jan. 30 seems uncivilized to Westerners . Yet we have labored for two centuries to perfect a fair judicial system , only to find ourselves bound in a cumbersome process that often prevents justice from prevailing . We should learn from the Chinese . <P> Sharon Bergren <P> Portland , Ore . <P> So criminal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 5,000 executions . I thought capital punishment had no deterrent value . <P> Simon Raskin <P> New York City <P> Study and Play
