" This , " said a Knick official , who had asked that his name not be used , " is the pits . " The ghosts of the exciting Knick teams seemed to flutter around the championship flags of 1970 and 1973 that hung from the rafters . One might have imagined a wind whistling through the empty seats and upper reaches of the vast arena. // Crowds of 4 , 000 and 5 , 000 were showing up where once capacity crowds of nearly 20 , 000 emoted with such intensity that , as Frazier once said when coming back to the bench after a terrific Knick spurt , " you listen to that standing ovation and it just makes you jingle inside. " // The Knicks now seemed not only lifeless , but hopeless. // Suddenly , they began to win . On Saturday night they returned to the Garden from a road trip and beat Chicago , 94-79 . It was the Knicks ' 14th victory in 17 games. // The Knicks pushed their record to 28 victories , 29 losses , and if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of March , they ' d be the fifth of six teams in the Eastern Conference to qualify. // The joint wasn ' t necessarily jumping on Saturday night , but it certainly was stirring . The crowd of 9 , 076 was definitely pregnant with possibility. // The Garden cognoscenti - and there are many in the throng - can spot a good pick as quickly as they can a good pickpocket . What they saw on Saturday night were more hands and arms than had been visible on the court in some time . " If you ' re not going to keep your hands up on defense , " said Hubie Brown , the Knick coach , chastising his pigeon-toed veteran guard , Paul Westphal , " then there ' s no reason for you to be out there. " // And the coach , who prepares for games with the detail of a paleontologist , scouts the rivals carefully and knows their plays , diligently explains it all to his players - and expects them to see the plays unravelling as he does. // " C @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ players on the court near him , " you knew your guy was going baseline - that ' s like our No. 5 play ! " // On offense , the Knicks are nor longer shooting the first chance they get their hands on the ball . But they ' re still less than perfect. // " You don ' t have to take a shot like that facing the basket , " shouts Brown at Bill Cartwright , the 7-foot-1-inch center with a mustache and goatee in the shape of a long O. // But later , there comes a play that pleases Brown , and he claps . Cartwright gets the ball in the pivot , passes out to Westphal in the corner at the baseline . Westphal looks , then passes back to Cartwright . Cartwright passes back to Westphal . Westphal returns the ball . Almost like the old game of keep the hat away . But Cartwright bangs toward the basket and hits a short hook. // " That ' s patience , " Brown would say after the game . " Earlier in the season @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and been tied up . Or Westphal would have shot because he would have been so surprised to get a pass he figured he ' d better make the most of it. " // It is obvious that the team is becoming more comfortable with itself . Only two of the 11 players Saturday night were with the Knicks for all of last season - Cartwright and Marvin Webster . Sly Williams was out for some of the year with a variety of problems and Westphal joined them for only the last 18 games. // The coach is also in his first year . " I didn ' t inherit a team , " he said , " I inherited a group of people meeting for the first time . " At first many bridled at the acidic language Brown uses . " But after awhile , " said Westphal , " you realize that that ' s him and you don ' t take it personally . " Brown maintains a tighter control of his team than most coaches . He calls most of the plays on offense . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be no mixup on the calls . But for all his planning , for all his firmness , it took an accident - perhaps two - to get the Knicks going . In mid-January , both Bernard King , the high-scoring forward , and Ed Sherod , the rookie point guard , were injured . This opened up the chance for Cartwright and Truck Robinson , the forward , to become more than just spectators on offense . Each responded with a series of 20-point games , and Cartwright has averaged 19. 6 points in the last 17 games. // And Westphal , a 10-year league veteran , became the point guard , or floor leader . He was not as tight as Sherod , a rookie who seemed hesitant to make a risky pass into the pivot for fear of Hubie ' s net plucking him off the court. // The Knicks launched the winning streak . When King and Sherod returned , the team continued to win . King , always a team player , has fit snugly back in. // Dave DeBusschere , a forward on the Knick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basketball operations , stands in a runway on floor level , white-haired at age 42 , in tan corduroy jacket and canvas shoes , arms crossed . " They ' re quicker and they ' re more confident , " he observed after the game . He mentioned the recent acquisition of Rory Sparrow , a swift guard , as being a big help . " There ' s no substitute for quickness. " // He added , " They ' re learning how to win , and no longer just trying to hang on . But , hey , we ' ve still got a long way to go . " Hubie Brown was equally sanguine . When it was mentioned that only one of the 14 teams the Knicks beat in their streak had better than a . 500 record , he said without hesitation , " You ' re on the right track. " // The next two games the Knicks play are against Philadelphia and Boston at home , tomorrow and Saturday . Is that a test ? " We ' re coming together , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miracle in one year . The 76ers and the Celtics are tremendously talented and have playoff experience . Hey , the Lakers are 0 and 4 against those two teams. " // " Reality , " said Brown , " is reality. " //
