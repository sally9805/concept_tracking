It was an art concerned primarily with the extraordinary rise of mass culture in a postwar America characterized by the atom bomb , consumerism , mass media and marketing , pre-packaged suburban utopias , and soon , in the heat of the Vietnam war - questions about the future of American democracy and culture. // It was the art of Warhol , Robert Rauschenberg , Jasper Johns , Claes Oldenburg , and others . These new postwar artists not only broke free from the Abstract Expressionists , such as Jackson Pollock , who after many years of struggle were gaining respectability . They also broke with the accepted 20th-century artistic modes molded in Europe and legitimized in New York with the help of powerful art critics such as Clement Greenberg. // // They were , in fact , the first artists to make the ' ' middlebrow ' ' culture of an industrial , middle-class America the main subject of their work. // If art must connect with the concrete experience of modern life , as the postwar artists felt , it must include the symbols , icons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peculiarly American , and that were shared by a growing number of Americans : Coca-Cola , tract houses , barbecue pits , the Ford ' ' T-bird , ' ' the American eagle , Marilyn Monroe , Betty Crocker ' s chocolate cake , George Washington , TV , civil rights. // ' ' Made in U.S.A. , ' ' an exhibition currently showing at the University Art Museum in Berkeley , Calif. , and scheduled to tour two other cities , is the first major retrospective of American art of the ' 50s and ' 60s , works that have become high-priced and far flung. // Sidra Stich , curator of the University Art Museum , spent three years raising money for this exhibit and collecting the work of the some 90 artists included . She has also produced an impressive 275-page interpretive catalog of the show , which includes her own extensive text and three essays by others. // What was America in the mid-20th century ? This was the question the artists of the time chose to deal with . Was it identical rows of gray high-rise apartments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kennedy ? Disneyland ? Bob Hope ? Serial killers ? Was it the ' ' lonely crowd ' ' - or the ' ' organization man ' ' ? Selma , Ala. - or Tranquillity Base ? Paradise Found - or ' ' Apocalypse Now ' ' ? Robert Rauschenberg ' s imagistic collages suggest it was all these things - happening at the same time. // But even if America had become ' ' thoroughly modern , ' ' a powerful homey streak persisted . As artist Allan D ' Arcangelo recently said of Warhol ' s famous Campbell ' s soup can : ' ' Warhol was telling America , ' This is you . The soup can is what you really understand at a deep gut-level . You are not all the other cultural trappings and affectations . This is what you really know. ' ' ' // The artists - who just as often exhibited in small galleries in Boston or San Francisco as in New York - didn ' t aspire to be ' ' fine artists . ' ' Some mocked the idea . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the art of ' ' direct experience . ' ' Of the now. // One result is the playfulness of the art on view here . Wayne Thiebaud painted rows of hot dogs . Claes Oldenburg made a pile of five-foot vinyl french fries with vinyl ketchup , and wrote , ' ' I ' m for an art that grows up not knowing it is art at all , an art given the chance of starting at zero . . . that embroils itself with the everyday crap and still comes out on top. ' ' // But unlike such commercial ' ' Pop ' ' artists as Peter Max , the postwar group was not merely out on a lark celebrating yellow submarines and clouds . ' ' Made in U.S.A. ' ' establishes that there was a serious and penetrating social insight among many of these artists . Vija Celmens ' s ' ' Freeway ' ' ( 1966 ) , for example , takes up themes that would become rallying cries in the ' 70s - the dissociation of man from the natural environment , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' s revered patriarchs also comes into question in these works : In one of his works , Rauschenberg places the visage of Lincoln in a collage with a tin-stamped serial number , a symbol of regimentation and of the new ' ' throw-away ' ' culture . Tom Wesselman sets the austere image of Washington alongside a live television screen - juxtaposing the ' ' sacred ' ' and profane. // If the ' 50s and ' 60s marked a fundamental shift in the American consciousness , one of the main causes was the bomb . ' ' The power to destroy the world had an incalculable effect , ' ' curator Stich said in an interview . ' ' Here , for the first time , was finality within the consciousness of mankind. ' ' // The postwar artists did not take up the bomb in a literal way . But the possibility of mass destruction , and the tensions of the cold war , certainly affected their work . Living on the edge , they found that many of the small wonders of American life ( TV dinners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ' headlines in tabloid newspapers actually seemed mundane . In their work , these can even take on a strange or unreal quality : The box of new , improved Brillo pads , reproduced by Warhol , for example , can seem bizarre . In a world capable of exploding , here were Americans going bananas over the scrubbing power of a steel wool soap pad. // This ' ' strangeness ' ' is explored in a lighter vein through the various takeoffs on comic strips , which had become phenomenally popular in the ' 50s and ' 60s . Roy Lichtenstein , for example , poked fun at the false melodrama and often stilted dialogue found in the comics. // Throughout ' ' Made in U.S.A. , ' ' one is struck by the incredible diversity of the postwar group : Wayne Thiebaud ' s thick , gooey , ' ' eatable ' ' paints ; Edward Kienholz ' s milk-can and bicycle-seat sculpture ; Ray Johnson ' s retouched images of Elvis Presley . The artists took in a double portion of the spirit of their times - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dylan song title framed it , ' ' Love Minus Zero : No Limit. ' ' // In short , the exhibit is an excellent capsule of a seminal cultural period ( as are films like ' ' Platoon ' ' and the Beatles ' recently rereleased ' ' Sgt. Pepper ' ' ) . The art will be valuable in illustrating future histories of that era. // The ' ' Made in U.S.A. ' ' exhibit will be on view in Kansas City ( July 25-Sept. 6 ) , at the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art , and in Richmond , Va . ( Oct. 7- Dec. 7 ) at the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts. // The catalog , ' ' Made in U.S.A. : An Americanization in Modern Art , the ' 50s &; ' 60s ' ' ( $24. 95 soft cover ; $60 cloth ) , is available from the University of California Press , Berkeley , Calif. // //
