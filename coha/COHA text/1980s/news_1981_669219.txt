With that clarion call , Tim Page  --  music critic and classical disc jockey  --  is bringing radio into the ' 80s. // Host of an afternoon show on WNYC , New York ' s public FM station , he has launched a fresh kind of programming designed to make " new music " a daily item in his listeners ' diet. // I ' s a risky venture . On the first day , last February , Page featured a " minimal " piece by Steve Reich called " Six Pianos "  --  and received more than 30 calls from listeners convinced the record was stuck . But the experiment has caught on , with mail running almost unanimously in favor of Page ' s bold approach. // And soon , audiences across the United States may be able to tune in . Beginning the first week in October , WNYC plans to offer a weekly new-music show for national syndication , presenting contemporary compositions and performers on a steady basis . This reflects not only the growing interest in recent music , but the coming-of-age of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and disseminate its own brand of entertainment. // I visited WNYC , which has the largest FM listenership in the US , to discuss its new programs and plans . In Page ' s view , " New music is about to go the way of new art  --  the massive Picasso exhibition , the sold-out galleries in SoHo  --  and new film , which everyone lines up to see . You can come to new music from many different directions , which is very exciting . For the first time in years , the cutting edge of classical music is developing into a truly **28;8190; popular <> music. " // Yet except for some college outlets , most FM stations are locked into traditional programming , with occasional nods to such decades-old radicals as Schonberg and Varese . Why hasn ' t new music caught on before now ? // " It ' s partly the fault of the composers , " Page says . " There ' s been a lot of mumbo jumbo that you need to have a PhD and deeply analyze the score to enjoy it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What matters is the visceral appeal. " // This fits right in with Page ' s programming practices . How does he decide what to include on his show ? " I don ' t mean to sound primitive , " he says , " but the most important prerequisite is  --  how it sounds ! If I like it , if I think it ' s good music , I ' ll play it. " // So the variety is wide . " I ' ll go back to Palestrina , " he says . " This isn ' t exactly a new-music show . It ' s a **28;8220; quality <> music show , but I like to stretch the listener ' s ears . I ' ll play old Caruso recordings if I find them exciting  --  even an occasional warhorse , if it fits philosophically with what I ' m doing . I try to think of continuity , of one piece leading into another. " // Behind the Page philosophy is the idea that " new music comes out of so many paths . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Steve Reich fanatic " who calls Reich " a tone-track into the future . " ( If there ' s any doubt of their kinship , listen to the Reichian sounds on Side 2 of Bowie ' s album " Low , " with Brian Eno . ) Yet classical critic Andrew Porter " will write a long column analyzing Reich in great musical detail . " In sum , says Page , new music can be enjoyed from many perspectives . " After all , it ' s just a step beyond old music. " // Page gets prompt agreement from John H. Beck , director of the New York Communications Service  --  the city agency of which WNCY is a part . " There are people who feel that if they like rock , they can ' t like classical , " he says . " One of our barrier : If it stayed as rigid as it was a few years ago , you ' d have no more classical listeners by around the turn of the next century ! But rock has evolved , and created @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what most rock performers can give them . They aren ' t going to turn to Beethoven . They might go to new music , though . It has things in common with rock , and it ' s not part of an establishment. " // So new music could be the spirit of radio ' s future , for rockers as well as classical fans . In the meantime , Beck is thoroughly enjoying the experiment and taking in stride the controversies over pieces programmed by Page . " Here at the station , " Beck says , " people were concerned about the new programming . But I ' m used to listener complaints . If three months go by without some big ones , I ' m not sure we ' re alive ! " // Since new music is indeed new , the first question of many potential listeners is , what does it sound like . The answer is : almost anything . As if to prove that point , Page recently produced a concert at Carnegie Hall called " New Music from New York . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for WNYC-FM , it gave a heady overview of new-music activity in all its shapes and guises. // After a brief reading by poet John Ashbury , the program openes with the 1980 organ solo " Fourth Series , Part 1 , " by Philip Glass , a gentle piece combining repetitive rhythms with faint echoes of " Over the Rainbow . " Exploratory , yes , but still played on Carnegie Hall ' s grand old organ. // For real radicals , the next performer was Kirk Nurock with his Natural Sound group , who launched into a cheerful piece based largely on barking and howling  --  joined by three real dogs , who promptly upstaged every human in sight. // The evening became no more predictable as it proceeded . Ad Hoc Rock played delicately pulsing sounds that hovered between pop , electronic music , and the planet Ork . Jonathan Haas and Thomas Hamilton played a duet for tympani and technology , with variably pitched kettle drums counterpointing a tableful of tapes and synthesizer hardware. // Stefani Starlin played a bitter- sweet flute solo called " Post Rigabop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trio " Tablet , " which passes through folk song to something more like birdsong . The Harmonic Choir , led by David Dykes , performed a piece based on simple chords and over- tones  --  the Living Theater used to do something a little like this called a " communal chord "  --  which filled the hall with a sense of peace . Paul Jacobs played sprightly Virgil Thomson portraits , making that venerable contemporary seem like the patriarch of the concert. // There were disappointments , as when jazzman Sun Ra  --  who has been a star longer than many of these musicians have been alive  --  didn ' t have enough time to develop his splendidly anarchic act . But there were favorites , too , such as organist Paul Alexander playing a sonata with both fists combing the keyboard in long sonic sweeps. // The whole shebang ended with the Lar/Dance troupe , directed by Lar Lubovitch , premiering an ecstatic dance accompaniment to Steve Reich ' s sprightly " Octet. " // It was as various and as invigorating as an evening can get , clearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adventurous musicians. // Often their work is equally effective as music and as theater  --  when a straight performance simply looks interesting , as in Reich ' s " Drumming , " or when a work is composed with dramatic applications in mind , as in Glass ' s " chamber opera , " which can be set to any appropriate scenario ( including the strange and stately " Panther " now onstage in New York  --  see the arts-entertainment pages of Thursday , May 28 , for full review ) . // Naturally , this theatrical quality will be missing from recordings and broadcasts . Yet the new openness toward new music on the airwaves is an important step in developing a stronger American foothold for contemporary art . It currently flourishes more healthily in Europe , where it receives vigorous public and private support . But recent music is on the upswing in the United States , and with increased exposure and growing popularity , the best seems yet to come. // //                 @ @ @ @
