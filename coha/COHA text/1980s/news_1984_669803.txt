FRAZZLED FRINGE : Confused employers seek guidance on tuition benefits . Most employers subsidize optional education for employees , but tax exemption for this fringe benefit expired Dec. 31 without Congress ' s acting to extend it . Renewal chances are good ; but meanwhile , employers don ' t know whether to continue aid or , if they do , whether to withhold tax on it from pay . Job-skill-related and employer-required courses remain exempt , but the IRS offers little guidance on what to do about optional self-improvement studies . Most employees aren ' t aware of the problem yet . Most companies in a spot check are continuing aid and betting on renewed exemption . Tenneco , Advanced Micro Devices and McKesson don ' t plan to begin withholding ; but General Electric , which paid $6 million to 14 , 000 studious employees in 1982 , says it will withhold . Del Still , Advanced Micro Devices training chief , is concerned that workers will be discouraged from going to school if exemption isn ' t reenacted .

The IRS takes taxpayer aid on the road . In last year ' s filing season , the IRS began sending staffers to company cafeterias , community centers and other locations to conduct seminars and group self-help sessions for doing returns . The aid ' s the same as you ' d get at an IRS office , but is scheduled in advance at more convenient sites . The IRS calls the program Outreach . Last year , it had 2 , 300 sessions at 2 , 000 sites , but reached only 39 , 500 taxpayers . This year , it wants to expand . The sessions are designed for low- and middle-income persons filing 1040EZ , 1040A , and simple 1040 returns ; such items as the elderly and child-care credits and the working-couple deduction are covered . Employers and organizations can call local IRS Outreach or taxpayer-education coordinators to arrange for sessions .

Du Pont IV has to step down at the end of 1984 , but he is thought to have national ambitions  --  running for president in 1988 , say . Now , he proposes a political coup  --  the second personal-tax cut of his tenure . Reductions would average nearly 8% , but range up to 26% for the top bracket of taxable income above $50 , 000 . The relief is needed " to attract decision-makers " and related jobs to the small state , the governor says . The tax rate for that top bracket was trimmed to 13. 5% from 17. 8% in 1979 ; Du Pont would drop it under 10% . In one low bracket , the rate would fall to 6% from 6. 3% . Estimated revenue losses of $30 million would be eased by a 15% rise in corporate franchise taxes , which range from $20 to $110 , 000 ; that would recoup $12 million .

The IRS seeks to reverse a **28;118;TOOLONG ruling denying it access to " tax-accrual workpapers "  --  containing analyses of tax issues  --  prepared by Arthur Young &; Co. in auditing Amerada Hess ; that court said the papers must be confidential to protect the audit process . The IRS argues that there ' s no countant-client privilege " like the one that shelters lawyers ' dealings with clients . Young defends limited protection for such papers , which it says involve expected tax liabilities , not actual returns . It ' s backed by briefs from other CPA firms ; the Tax Executives Institute , a professional group ; El Paso Co. , which was ordered by a different appeals court to disclose such papers to the IRS , and others .
