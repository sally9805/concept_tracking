They came back with some of the stunning photographs in this week 's report on " The Wedding of the Century . " Julian Calder shot the wedding ceremony from the 100-ft. - high whispering gallery inside St. Paul 's Cathedral . Across the plaza Terry Spencer crouched in a fourth-floor window and photographed the royal procession . Nearby , Dirck Halstead snapped the passing parade , then joined other photographers in a champagne toast for the bride and bridegroom . After taking pictures of the fireworks display in Hyde Park on the eve of the wedding , Neil Leifer grabbed three hours of sleep before moving into place outside Buckingham Palace at 5:30 a.m .
