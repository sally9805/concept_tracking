SUNDAY IN THE PARK WITH GEORGE Music and Lyrics by Stephen Sondheim ; Book by James Lapine <P> A century ago , when he began painting A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte , Georges Seurat froze a score of weekend strollers into pointillist immortality . Now they are posed on a Broadway stage , thawing into something like life . The matron on the right , with the bustle and the chained monkey ? She is the artist 's mistress , Dot ( Bernadette Peters ) , pretty as a picture but not quite so still ; she would rather be at the Follies . See the white bundle a man at the rear is holding ? That is the infant daughter of Dot and the artist ; she will grow up in America , and in Act II her grandson George , a sculptor , will take a journey of self-discovery back to his roots on this island in the Seine : <P> And where is Seurat ( Mandy Patinkin ) ? Everywhere . Finishing a hat , making trees and boats appear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their child to remain faithful to the only dots that matter : those in his painting . " I am not hiding behind my canvas , " he declares . " I am living in it . " Only he could live there , where the emotional chaos of life can be made as ordered and harmonious as a green thought in a green shade . <P> Seurat was the wayward child of impressionism . Renoir and Sisley might seek to catch life on the fly ; he would aspire to stasis . Their voluptuous brushstrokes were too imprecise , too sensational for this artist-scientist . Seurat worked dot by meticulous dot , woodpeckering the canvas with pricks of color that would fuse into meaning in the spectator 's eye . So it is with the sculptor in Act II of Sunday in the Park with George . This George composes bit by bit , or byte by byte . He has created a computerized sculpture , Chromolume #7 ( chromo-luminarism is an other critical term for Seurat 's technique ) , that puts on a sound-and-light show at the flick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visionary 's looking glass into the past , to find art merging with dreams on an ordinary Sunday on La Grande Jatte . <P> Broadway audiences may have more trouble than George stepping into this austere , demanding concept . No high-kicking razzmatazz here ; in fact , no choreography . No heart-pummeling sentiment ; in fact , virtually no characters , as Author-Director James Lapine follows Seurat 's lead and dehydrates his actors into cardboard stereotypes . Nor is there a surfeit of " **25;7347;TOOLONG melodies , " Stephen Sondheim 's derisively witty phrase from his last show , Merrily We Roll Along . Sondheim long ago renounced such simple show-biz pleasures ; neither Dot nor the audience gets to go to the Follies . This score is often doggedly mimetic , achieving its pointillist effects note by Johnny-one-note . Nearly every number begins with a staccato verse and chorus ; it soars toward traditional musical passion only at midpoint , then withdraws into tart anticlimax . It takes a second or third hearing for ballads like Finishing the Hat , Beautiful and Sunday to betray subterranean seisms of feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart beats under that starched shirt .
