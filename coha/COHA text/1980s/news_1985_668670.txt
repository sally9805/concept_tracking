It is midafternoon on Monday , and the glitter list in Tom Lasorda ' s office includes only a character actor and an NBA coach . The beautiful people have not yet descended upon Dodger Stadium . Lasorda , in fact , is in the midst of something that would bore Don , Frank and Sammy ; he is doing something that most people believe he only pantomimes . He is teaching . He is in the batting cage with Mariano Duncan , his 22-year-old shortstop from the Dominican Republic . Lasorda earnestly lectures Duncan in Spanish . The only English words are " Ty Cobb " and " Maury Wills . " It becomes clear , after a while , that this is a bunting lesson , especially when Lasorda places a box on its side near the third-base line . He points at the box . " Aqui , " he says . " Uno peso . " Duncan bunts all around the box , knocks balls down the line . " Suave , " Lasorda says , meaning soft . Just then , Duncan deposits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lasorda proclaims . " Dos pesos . " Now Lasorda grabs the bat himself , to show Duncan how many hits abound for him on the left side of the infield . Coach Joe Ferguson fires Lasorda three pitches . Lasorda swings and misses at one , pops the other two against the side of the cage  --  it ' s been a long time . " What are you doing to the ball ? " Lasorda screams . Duncan begins laughing . " Anyway , " Lasorda says , " you know what I mean . You got ta practice this stuff , you know . " The manager walks behind the cage , getting himself steeled for the ticket requests and the hugs and the kisses that will dominate his pregame hours . But with the sun still high , you can almost believe in these quiet , offstage moments that Lasorda ' s function here is the management of a baseball club . " It took a long time for us to get going , " he says softly . " I tell you what , it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ catch the ball , and people were laughing at us . But the manager ' s job is to keep their confidence up during times like that . They never complained , they never blamed each other , they never blamed the organization . I ' m proud of this ballclub . " Dodger Blue , tinted with defeat and injury during the 83 losses of 1984 , is a flying color once more . The same team that trudged to a 27-27 mark during the first third of the season romped to a 37-17 record in the second third . In the process , the Dodgers laid a seven-game hammerlock on the rest of the NL West . Their obvious strengths have held up  --  the league ' s most accomplished pitching staff , plus an MVP-caliber season from Pedro Guerrero  --  but it was supposed to take more than that . " Nobody before the season picked us in the first division , " catcher Mike Scioscia says . " And when you look at us man-to-man , you got ta like half the clubs in this league better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way Los Angeles has hit . 306 with men in scoring position since June 1 , and the way new third baseman Enos Cabell has juiced up the batting order , and the way Duncan has dived into the Dodgers ' hole at shortstop , and the way their deluge of hit-and-runs , squeezes and steals has made runs rise up out of nothing . You got ta love the way Guerrero , despite his 28 homers , 68 RBI and . 331 average , cheerfully goes the other way to move runners along , and the way Scioscia has returned from rotator cuff surgery to hit a useful . 275 . He says , " We were busting our butts even when we were losing . We were diving all over the place for balls , even when we didn ' t get them . We were getting dirty . So then it just followed that we started playing well . There ' s one thing to remember about this club : It ' s not accustomed to losing . " Much of the Dodger revival stems from the arrogance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depart for more lucrative territory , the hopes have rested with Guerrero , first baseman Greg Brock , second baseman Steve Sax and right-fielder Mike Marshall . It was assumed they would play with the spontaneous excellence that distinguished their predecessors . After all , Marshall had driven in 137 runs at Albuquerque one year , and Brock 138 the next . But somehow the future four never did it together . Sax had those gruesome throwing spasms . Marshall was always hurt , and Brock , dwindling in Garvey ' s shadow , was demoted to Albuquerque for 24 games last year . " He could have hit 70 homers and nobody would have been satisfied , " Scioscia says . And when Guerrero , squeamish at third base and haunted by a big contract , slumped to 72 RBIs last year , the Dodgers followed him down to fourth place . All the kids were mentioned in the marketplace over the winter . Sid Bream , not Brock , was the opening day first baseman . Yet Lasorda and general manager Al Campanis stood stubbornly in the firm soil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been taught to win and , by God , they would . Now they have . Sax makes the plays and steals bases . Marshall , coming off an appendectomy , is hitting . 280 . Brock has jerked 16 homers . " He ' s a situation hitter now , " Lasorda says . " We convinced him he doesn ' t have to hit homers with a guy on third and less than two out . He goes up the middle and he goes the other way . He ' s eliminated the holes in his swing . " The Albuquerque kids , now ranging from 25 ( Marshall and Sax ) to 29 ( Guerrero ) , have made the varsity . The Dodgers also have 36 pinch-hits and a 22-14 record in one-run games . But their time-honored one-two punch  --  pitching and Guerrero  --  still carries them . Orel Hershiser , Fernando Valenzuela , Jerry Reuss and Bob Welch have a combined record of 43-19 with a 2. 39 earned run average . Guerrero , of course , tied the major league record for home runs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swallowed hard and moved him to the outfield . " All he did was go in the record books with George Herman Ruth , " Lasorda says .
