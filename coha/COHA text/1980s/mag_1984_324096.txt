Walter Mondale came to Dallas for that most prosaic of political events , a campaign fund-raising dinner , and he had intended to talk about a drab , unemotional subject-the problems facing small businesses . But he tossed away his prepared speech . As he rambled on last Monday night , he found himself turning his campaign talk into a rather passionate tutorial on religion and liberty . " The founding fathers spelled it out in great detail , " he said , when it came to writing the First Amendment . " What they spelled out is the separation of church and state . " Suddenly the 800 well-to-do Texans erupted with applause , then , still clapping , stood up . The candidate knew he had struck a resounding chord . <P> " Now why did the framers do that ? " continued Mondale . " Because they saw in Europe that every time you let the politicians interfere with religious faith , it was poison and it destroyed its integrity and independence , and that politicians were always posturing and interfering . . . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religion would be here and was between ourselves and our God , and the politicians would be over there-and we 'd never get the two mixed up . . . In America , faith is personal and honest and uncorrupted by political interference . " As the crowd leaped up to applaud once again , Mondale added a kind of secular amen : " May it always be that way . " <P> The Democrat 's extemporaneous exegesis was unusual , but it did not come out of the blue . Just four days earlier in Dallas at a prayer breakfast , President Reagan had declared that politics and religion were inseparable . He charged that opponents of organized prayer in public schools " are intolerant of religion , " that " morality 's foundation is religion " and that " without God , democracy will not and can not long endure . " The President got a response at least as enthusiastic as Mondale 's . The emotion on both sides reveals a fundamental disagreement in U.S. society over the role that religious beliefs should play in public life . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ campaign . Indeed , the prominence and the complexity of religious issues may now be greater than in any previous election . At stake on one level are a set of tough , specific public policy matters with a clear religious dimension : abortion , public school prayer , tax credits for parents of private school students . The debate has also raised more abstract questions : Just how should faith inform public policymaking ? Should clergy involve themselves and their congregations directly in politics ? To what extent should religious beliefs be thrust into the campaign ?
