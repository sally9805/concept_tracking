Recent leaks to the press make clear for the first time that both sides are working to eliminate all tariffs on two-way trade within 10 to 12 years . No exceptions would be made to protect weak industries or the massive automobile trade. // // At the same time , there are reports that the Reagan administration has chosen free trade with Canada and arms control as the top-priority items for the remainder of its term . At the first meeting of the Cabinet attended by Howard Baker , the White House ' s new chief of staff , free trade was seen as one of a handful of major foreign policy achievements President Reagan ' ' can realistically aim for as he attempts to reestablish momentum , overcome his Iran troubles , and secure his place in history , ' ' according to a report in the Financial Post of Toronto. // Ironically , the higher emphasis in the US comes at a time when the Canadian government - which has been vigorously trying to get Washington to focus more on the talks - may be running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a ' ' freer trade area ' ' when Prime Minister Brian Mulroney first proposed it in 1985 . However , it was expected that some sectors , such as automobiles and cultural institutions , would be exempt. // Opposition seems to be growing . Canadian nationalists fear a totally free trade area could weaken Canada ' s cultural independence . Several politicians , particularly in Ontario , are sounding alarmed about potential business losses in such areas as automobile trade. // Other Canadians feel that the country has not fared well in recent individual trade disputes with the US and are not sure their government is taking a tough enough stance in representing Canadian interests . The issue has hurt Mr. Mulroney politically. // Last week , Canada ' s provincial premiers were briefed on the negotiations . Parliament debates the free trade issue today for the first time in some 18 months , with Mulroney leading off the discussion . The negotiators also meet today in Ottawa for another bargaining session. // The US and Canada already conduct the largest volume of trade between any two nations in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Canadian statistics . ( Trade between the US and Japan amounted to $112 billion in 1986 . ) A free-trade agreement is expected to boost that volume and benefit business in both nations . If the negotiators achieve their aim and Congress and Parliament approve , the 2 , 500-mile border will be virtually eliminated in ' ' an economic sense , ' ' as US Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter has said. // A deal must be reached by early fall , or it is not likely to be reached at all . The US Congress has agreed to consider an agreement on a ' ' fast track ' ' basis - a yes-or-no vote within 60 congressional working days . But that ' ' fast track ' ' legislation expires Jan. 3 , 1988 , and Congress must be notified of the deal 90 days in advance of that date . Observers figure it would be politically impossible for the Mulroney government to revive the talks if they were not concluded on the fast-track basis. // On April 5 and 6 , the negotiators will give President Reagan and Prime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' annual get-together , being held this year in Ottawa . No major decisions on free trade are expected at the summit , one negotiator says. // According to a senior Canadian source , Canada ' s chief negotiator , Simon Reisman , and his US counterpart , Peter Murphy , have aimed at eliminating all tariff and most non-tariff barriers to avoid getting bogged down in haggling over exemptions in the short time available. // A senior US source cautions : ' ' It is too early to make a guess on whether we will have to scale back our ambitious agenda . . . We won ' t know until summer . ' ' By then , it should be clear which issues , if any , may be intractable. // Earlier this year , the US International Trade Commission gave the Office of the US Trade Representative a lengthy , nonpublic study of the impact of free trade on American business . The trade office is reviewing the study in detail . Because of the size of the American economy - 10 times larger than that of Canada @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though still highly significant. // The trade deal is very important politically to the Mulroney administration , which sees free trade as a necessity if Canada is to keep up economically . Weakened badly by various scandals and other issues , the government would welcome a major success before it calls an election sometime in the next two years. // Failure to conclude a good deal on free trade could rouse anti-Americanism in Canada if the Mulroney government blamed the US for the breakdown. // The Atlantic Council of the US , a nongovernmental , educational organization , says the results of the talks will have ' ' much to do with Canada ' s future posture - whether it remains outward-looking and an active partner in a cooperative political world and an expanding international economy , or whether , if rebuffed , it withdraws into a protectionist and nationalist shell , thus crippling its potential .

If a free-trade agreement eliminates all tariffs , the Canadian content requirement will have no teeth . In recent years , Canada has benefited the most from the deal . The US would like to even that score somewhat . Ontario , where most Canadian auto plants are located , resists any change. // *Cultural industries . Seeing its cultural identity as threatened by the giant next door , the Canadian government heavily supports the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation and protects in various ways private TV and radio , films , print media and book publishing from foreign competition , especially American . The US would like some of those protectionist devices reduced and , according to one report , Canadian negotiators will at least talk about it. // *A new mechanism for remedying trade disputes . Canada suggests ' ' binding ' ' bilateral arbitration to deal with disputes over subsidies , dumping , and other trade-related activities . The US Congress , though , may not favor an exception to established procedures . One alternative is a bilateral panel that would make nonbinding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ US wants Canada to reduce or eliminate some of the subsidies it provides industry. // *Easing investment controls .
