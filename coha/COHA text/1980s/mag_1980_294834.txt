AMADEUS by Peter Shaffer <P> The death of God , the need for God , the rage against God if he does exist have obsessed Britain 's Peter Shaffer for more than a decade . He has written three psychodramas that are , in a way that no author of an adulterous farce could imagine , plays about the eternal triangle . Two men are pitted against each other under the baleful or indifferent eye of a God who is present but never made manifest . <P> This phase of Shaffer 's career began with The Royal Hunt of the Sun ( 1964 ) . In that play , Atahuallpa , who is both emperor and god of the Incas , is executed by the order of Pizarro , the Spanish conquistador . The most desolating moment of the play comes when Pizarro , who has lost faith in the Christian God , hopes against hope that Atahuallpa will be resurrected before his eyes . He is not . In Equus ( 1973 ) , a boy blinds horses because he believes them to be gods who have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Decrying his own dried-up rationality , the analyst envies the boy his pagan faith and passion . Sharing D.H . Lawrence 's ideality of the " blood consciousness , " Shaffer seems to agree with Freud that man 's discontents are the high price of civilization . <P> In Amadeus , Shaffer reworks these themes in a drama that is less dramatically arresting or emotionally compelling than the previous two plays . In a threadbare season , it nonetheless sheds the glow of Joseph 's coat of many colors . This time Shaffer focuses on two contenders on the treacherous fields of artistic fame and glory . Both are composers . One is Antonio Salieri ( Ian McKellen ) , a man who achieved phenomenal musical renown at the royal court of Vienna in the late 18th and early 19th centuries . <P> The other is Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart ( Tim Curry ) , who may be called a man or an immortal . We first meet Salieri on the day of his attempted suicide , when , with a twisted senile smirk , he begs the audience for absolution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years before . Beethoven reported this unsubstantiated charge in an entry of his conversation book of 1824 . More pertinently , Salieri confesses to the envy that breeds malice when a mediocre talent meets a transcendent genius . In editing and reshaping his own text for Broadway , Shaffer makes jealousy a key factor in Salieri 's persistent savaging of the hard-pressed Mozart in his attempts to secure court posts and paying pupils . <P> At this and other points - including a new scene concerning the premiere of The Magic Flute , which Salieri tried to thwart - the New York production is at variance , not always wisely , with the original production at London 's National Theater . <P> The story proceeds in flashback us ing Salieri as narrator . The device impedes the dynamics of the play and some times makes the Viennese court seem like a cynically corrupted version of Grover 's Corners . Early on , when Salieri is 16 , he kneels in prayer and makes a Faustian compact with God .
