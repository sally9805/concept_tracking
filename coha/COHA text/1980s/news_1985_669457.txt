' ' The phone call , ' ' quips lyricist Sammy Cahn , with an impish smile that makes him look like a well-tailored leprechaun in a natty blue blazer and light-brown trousers. // ' ' The phone rings , and maybe Frank Sinatra will say , ' I ' m doing a film called ' ' The Tender Trap , ' ' and we need a title song . ' I ' m not walking around thinking of songs about ' The Tender Trap . ' What am I going to do with a song called ' The Tender Trap ' unless someone asks for it ? ' ' // // That crucial phone call has come many times to this legendary wordsmith , whose verses ring down the decades of America ' s popular culture in songs like ' ' High Hopes , ' ' ' ' All the Way , ' ' ' ' My Kind of Town , ' ' and ' ' Teach Me Tonight ' ' - to pick a random few from a staggering list that includes those two anthems to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ll Walk Alone ' ' and ' ' It ' s Been a Long , Long Time . ' ' When Sammy ' s autobiographical show , ' ' Words and Music ' ' - which had been a hit on Broadway - opened in London in the ' 70s , one British writer found himself coming to ' ' the astonishing realization that I had more of the words of Sammy Cahn in my head than of Shakespeare ' s. ' ' // Along the way , Sammy has picked up four ( not a misprint ) Oscars and is the only person ever awarded an Emmy for a song ( ' ' Love and Marriage ' ' ) . As recently as this month , the Tony Awards on TV featured songs from the 1947 Broadway show ' ' High Button Shoes , ' ' with lyrics by Cahn and music by Jule Styne. // Although Sammy may wait for phone calls , his motives are not purely commercial . ' ' I write for the sheer joy of writing , ' ' he explains , as we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boston to receive an award from the Anti-Defamation League ' s New England region. // ' ' Music speaks to me . I don ' t write a song as much as the song writes me . I can play you a melody , and you can think of a thousand - not a thousand , a million - word combinations to that string of notes . It ' s limitless. ' ' // But his gift - one of many that lie with unnoticed grace behind the deceptively plain idiom of his lyrics - is finding words that combine so naturally with the tune that you can ' t think of one without the other. // ' ' It has to sing , ' ' Sammy stresses about lyrics . ' ' How does it sing out of the mouth ? A poem reads ; a lyric sings . And it doesn ' t matter how intelligent it is , how grammatical it is. ' ' // Cahn almost always goes over to the composer ' s place and works on a typewriter made for him by IBM with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // ' ' First of all , I have to listen , ' ' Sammy says . ' ' I never fight a lyric . If it doesn ' t come with ease , I don ' t write it . ' ' The whole process usually takes about three hours . Sammy scorns the idea of poetic inspiration , or of verses coming to him in the middle of the night . ' ' The fellow who pays me doesn ' t have to be inspired to pay me , ' ' he points out , ' ' so I don ' t have to be inspired to write. ' ' // Nowadays Sammy applies his creative techniques to what he calls ' ' special lyrics for special occasions , ' ' which means he ' ll adapt one of his classics - if the money ' s right - for a client . For top AT &; T executives at an important company function , for instance , Sammy had the audacity to turn his familiar ' ' Time After Time ' ' lyrics into ' ' Time after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make a normal call. / I hear the coin drop , the tone begin and stop. / Then a lonely silence and that ' s all . ' ' The corporate brass loved it. // Such reworked verses pop up during the many special appearances he makes these days , in which audiences experience the shock of delighted recognition as he sings song after song from his list of ' ' credentials , ' ' as he calls them in his act. // The penchant for reworking lyrics began a long time ago for Sammy . When he was a 14-year-old , he used to amuse himself by parodying popular songs of the day while working in a meatpacking plant . His parents had immigrated to New York ' s Lower East Side from Poland , but he entertains no romantic notions about what motivates the residents of that impoverished cradle of creative talent : ' ' I think it ' s the need to get out of there. ' ' // For some 15 years he played violin in a small touring orchestra , and , as he arrived one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sign reading ' ' Restricted clientele . ' ' ' ' What ' s that mean ? ' ' he asked his fellow musicians . ' ' That means , ' ' they said , ' ' that we ' re going to paint a mustache on you , and for tonight your name is Clementi. ' ' // The fact he had to pretend he was Italian - that merely having a Jewish name would have barred him from the job - has stuck with Sammy all his life and accounts for his willingness to aid causes like the Anti-Defamation League . ' ' Even today , ' ' he says of those attitudes , ' ' it isn ' t fun . So I ' ve always been ready whenever the chance comes to stand up and be counted. ' ' // He ' s equally outspoken about today ' s pop-music scene , in which he sees great creative advances and also some unpleasant - even dangerous - signs . ' ' The word imagery is very , very exciting compared to what it used to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feels . ' ' Take the Lionel Richie or Stevie Wonder songs . If you listen hard , there ' s music and meaning . I call them ' M &; Ms. ' Wherever there ' s both music and meaning , you listen. ' ' // But some of today ' s harder rock - which he calls ' ' the noise ' ' - is emphatically not in that category , in Sammy ' s opinion . There ' s no reason , he says , a point can not be expressed with delicacy instead of the heavy-handedness of some current lyrics. // ' ' I remember when I was a very , very young man we had what they called the ' novelty songs ' - but there was always the ballad . And even in these times there is the ballad . Nothing replaces words and music . Noise subsides , music lingers. ' ' // The same inescapable principle applies to the theater , Sammy feels . ' ' On Broadway the big hit has been ' The King and I , ' by Rodgers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' by the Gershwins . ' ' This indicates that when you come to a theater , you come to hear the sounds of the theater . The sounds of the theater are very special . The great waltz song , for instance , or the great polka sound. // ' ' People go to the theater to hear that sound , and if you don ' t give it to them they feel they ' ve been cheated . If they want to hear any other sound they can go to discos , ballrooms , or wherever . But when they go to the theater and you ask them to pay upwards of $90 for a pair of tickets , you ' d better give them what they ' ve come for. ' ' // As so often in the past , Sammy Cahn is ready to prove his words - he ' s in the middle of writing the lyrics for a prospective Broadway show with composer Charles Strauss , who also did ' ' Annie . ' ' It ' s about the life of the great black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sammy , ' ' As I keep saying to Strauss , who ' s my junior - I don ' t know who isn ' t actually my junior - let ' s write theater songs. ' ' // He has also recently turned his hand to TV commercials , and he plays a tape for me of some skillfully contrived lyrics he ' s hoping American Airlines will buy for a new campaign. // And lots of his already familiar lines can be heard on the tube plugging other products to which he ' s sold the rights to certain songs . Meanwhile , Sammy is the current president of the Song Writers Hall of Fame and serves on the board of ASCAP ( American Society of Composers , Authors , and Publishers ) . // With all this - not to mention his role as father and grandfather - he finds little time for leisure . ' ' I ' ve got the greatest hobby in the world , ' ' he asserts . ' ' I write songs . One critic said of me , ' It ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likes to do so much and making a living at it.
