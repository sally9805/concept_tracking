The royal quartet , fresh from an outing in Scotland , grappled with a variety of hassles : driving wind , snowy tarmac , bulky luggage . And lots of dogs . There was Prince Charles ' retriever Harvey , who could n't wait to get off the plane . He bounded down the gangway , dragging Charles behind like a tin can . Then there was Anne 's retriever . He took one look at the steep gangway and cowered in the plane 's doorway . While a shirt-sleeved steward grabbed the dog , Princess Anne , with a stiff upper lip and fairly rigid upper arm , pulled on the dog 's lead . The retriever lost . And Diana ?

Valenzuela , suited up in a black tuxedo , and Linda , dressed in a $3,000 gown , took their vows in the bride 's home town . Valenzuela sneaked into the church by a back entrance to avoid a mob of well-wishers . Outside , many would-be guests were barred from the church by dozens of plainclothes policemen fearful that the crowd would charge the doors . The nuptials , presided over by two bishops and an archbishop , were broadcast nationally . Valenzuela , a cool customer on the mound , sweated the ceremony .
