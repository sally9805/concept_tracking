When the music changed , all Moscow knew that what it feared had happened <P> The day dawned gray and ordinary . As Muscovites looked outside at streets dusted with fresh snow , they could at least take comfort from the fact that it was Friday . Many turned on their radios , expecting the usual mix of news , pop music and light entertainment . What they heard instead were the melancholy strains of Chopin , Rachmaninoff and Tchaikovsky . Only 15 months before , such symphonic tributes had signaled the death of Leonid Brezhnev . Now the music was playing again . A Soviet office worker said it all : " Someone has died up there . " <P> Foremost in everyone 's mind was the distressing knowledge that Soviet Leader Yuri Andropov had not been seen in public since Aug. 18 , however often his name had been evoked in print and over the air waves . But in a nation where political successions have brought both terror and hope , the idea that another change in command was under way after little more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Andropov was ill , but many , uneasy with the prospect of a new transition , believed reports that he was convalescing . So a guessing game began . Some Soviets thought that Vasili Kuznetsov , the oldest member of the ruling elite , might have died on the eve of his 83rd birthday . Others figured it was Defense Minister Dmitri Ustinov , 75 , who had canceled an official visit to India a week earlier . But a worried Moscow housewife gave voice to the fear she shared with many of her compatriots : " It would be terrible if Andropov has died . We do n't need another change . " <P> The announcement finally came at 2:30 p.m. on Friday . Seated in an unadorned studio , Newscaster Igor Kirilov solemnly began to read the official text : " The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union , the Chairman of the Supreme Soviet of the U.S.S.R. , and the Council of Ministers . . . " At that point the screen went blank for a moment , and then the outlines of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intone offscreen : " . . . with deep sorrow inform the party and the entire Soviet people that Yuri Vladimirovich Andropov , General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party , chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet , died after a long illness at 16:50 on Feb. 9,1984 . " The face on the screen was Andropov 's . <P> As accustomed as the world may have grown to the idea of Andropov 's illness , the news of his death hit with exceptional force . It is always , of course , a dramatic event when one of the world 's two superpowers loses a leader . But when that country is a totalitarian state , the event evokes a special combination of hope and fear , not only within its own borders but around the world . Awakened at his Santa Barbara , Calif. , ranch with the news at 3:20 a.m. , President Reagan dispatched a message of condolence that expressed his wish for " genuine cooperation with the Soviet Union to make the world better . " Said former Secretary of State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is always a political turning point , and our policies and actions toward them can affect the direction in which the Soviets move .
