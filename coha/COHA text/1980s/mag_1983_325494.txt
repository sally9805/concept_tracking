Congress and the President push and pull over Central America <P> " We are better off than we were when we started , " said State Department Official William Schneider . " We are crawling back to where we want to be . " Sorting through the ambiguities created by a week 's worth of arm wrestling with Congress over control of Central American policy , the Administration was able to claim a marginal victory . Lobbyists from the State Department nudged key House and Senate panels toward giving more money and support to El Salvador than many critics had wanted . <P> Although the House tied the aid up in a cat's-cradle of conditions , the Administration kept open its options on the future of covert operations in Nicaragua and impressed on Congress a fresh spirit of bipartisanship . " There is a new willingness to look at the problem together , " said one State Department official . That may be because both sides face political peril . Republicans run the risk of being blamed for increased U.S. involvement in the murky politics of Central America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they block aid to the Salvadoran government . <P> On Tuesday , the Senate Foreign Relations Committee unanimously approved a compromise giving the Administration $76.3 million in military aid for El Salvador for fiscal 1983 , which ends Sept. 30 . The Administration had requested $136.3 million , and the committee had threatened to allot only $50 million . The Senate panel also approved a military package of $76.3 million for fiscal 1984 , only $10 million less than the Administration requested , and agreed to its full economic aid program : $140 million this year and $120 million in 1984 . <P> On Wednesday , however , the House Foreign Affairs Committee opted for a less generous compromise . It endorsed a plan worked out by Democrat Dante Fascell to give Reagan only $65 million in military aid for each of the next three fiscal years . It also attached eleven pages of conditions designed to curb human rights abuses by the Salvadoran government and to bring about " a dialogue , in good faith and without preconditions , " between the government and the guerrillas . The aim is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " If the government refuses to participate , U.S. aid would be cut off within 90 days ; if the guerrillas balk , the aid would continue . <P> Schneider said the Administration could live with the conditions . He contended that the Salvadoran government could engage in talks but still fend off the guerrillas ' previously stated demands to reorganize the government to include them , in effect canceling the results of last year 's elections , in which they had refused to participate . The Administration has backed the government of Alvaro Alfredo Magafta Borja in its resistance to such " power sharing , " and has suggested limiting any dialogue to a discussion of the ground rules under which both sides could participate in elections .
