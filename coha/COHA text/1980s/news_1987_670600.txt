The recent Palestinian demonstrations against Israel , which left at least 21 Palestinian youths dead , may one day be remembered as the changing of the guard among the Palestinians. // The Palestinian fathers grew up in the West Bank under Jordanian rule , or in Gaza under Egyptian rule . After Israel captured those territories in 1967 , they more or less came to terms with the situation , got to know a few Jews , worked in their factories , even learned some Hebrew and were , at least until last month , ready for a peaceful settlement with a Jewish state provided a Palestinian state was created alongside it . <> <> Few Have a Jewish Friend // But the sons , the stone-throwers , those who were ready to bare their chests at Israeli soldiers , had their temperaments forged in a different furnace . They have known only a dead-end life under the Israeli occupation . Few have ever had a Jewish friend . Few have not been interrogated by Israeli security men. // The Israeli soldiers their fathers feared and their grandfathers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wear their arrests , their prison records and their wounds with the same bravado that American teen-agers wear their high school letter jackets. // Where their fathers were ready to soften their political edges , maybe even make compromises with the Israelis , the sons only seem to know the dialogue of the stone and the politics of rage . Where their fathers were a moderating influence on the Palestine Liberation Organization , their sons are not afraid to mock the P.L.O. as a " Cadillac revolution " gone fat . <> <> An Exchange of Hatred // In the Balata refugee camp outside Nablus , in the Israeli occupied West Bank , a knot of 15- and 16-year-old boys , black-checked Arab headdresses wrapped around their necks , were gathered today outside a butcher shop . Many of them had friends or brothers taken away in the security roundups . All of them took part in the recent disturbances . Rawhi , 15 , flashed a bruise above his eye to prove it. // As they gossiped , an eight-man Israeli Army patrol walked by , its soldiers darting their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Palestinian youths for a moment . It was hard to tell who was more frightened , but the hatred they exchanged was electric. // " While the soldiers are inside the camp , we won ' t rise up , " one of the youths said quietly . " But as soon as they leave , we will rise again. " // " Yesterday was bad , " said another . " Today was very very bad , and tomorrow will be very , very , very bad. " // Talking with Palestinians in recent days , it has become clear that the riots have changed something : The fathers , who once had a common language with the Israelis , however limited , seem to have yielded the field to their sons , who know only the stone against the bullet. // Ilan Kfir , a reporter for the Israeli newspaper Hadashot , caught the mood when he wrote that after the riots in the West Bank and Gaza " it is doubtful whether any of the notables in the territories described as moderate and candidates for a Jordanian-Palestinian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rahme , not Hanna Siniora and certainly not veterans such as Elias Friej and Rashad as-Shawwa. // " If the political process is ever renewed , the rules of the game will be different , " he added . " The P.L.O. and leaders of the uprising in the territories - new names on the political map - will determine who will be the representatives to negotiations . It is doubtful whether a political consensus will be created in Israel in favor of negotiating with them . " <> <> Studying in Amman // Ibrahim Karaeen , a Palestinian journalist and nationalist in East Jerusalem , knows about the eclipse of the fathers . He has boys 7 and 5 years old and a girl of 3. // Mr. Karaeen was 19 when the June 1967 war broke out and was studying English at the University of Amman in Jordan . Israel sealed the border after the war , so he returned illegally with some friends by fording the Jordan River . On the other side , a patrol of soldiers arrested him. // " I had never met a Jew growing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea how they even looked . We were brought up to believe that they were all monsters . When the Israeli soldiers arrested me , I saw the monster for the first time and I was sure the monster would kill me . <> <> Some Good , Some Bad // " But then they took us to Nablus jail , and there I saw that there were some Israelis who would shout and curse at us all the time and others who would treat us decently , " he said . " I paid a fine , and they let me go to my home in Jerusalem. " // In 1972 he became one of the first Palestinians from the occupied territories to enroll at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem , from which he graduated in 1975 with a degree in English literature . Along the way he formed many friendships with Israelis. // " At the time , most of us never thought the occupation would continue for 20 years , so we thought we should use the opportunity to get to know each other , " he mused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I would invite them to my home. " // A staunch advocate of a Palestinian state , alongside a Jewish state , Mr. Karaeen feels certain most of his generation shares his views. // " I learned through my experiences to look at human beings as human beings and to treat them accordingly , " he said . " But the opportunity for interaction that was given to me will probably not be given to my children. " // Why ? As the occupation stretched into 20 years , Mr. Karaeen found his dialogue with Israelis dwindling away . Palestinians were either dealt with as quislings who cooperated with the occupation or they were banished to the margins , he said . Israel ' s category of Israeli " enemies " came to include even the moderate Palestinian nationalists ready to settle for a Palestinian state in the West Bank , Gaza and Jerusalem . <> <> Israelis Miss a Chance // Jamil Hammad , a 47-year-old Palestinian writer from Bethlehem , is the father of three sons between the ages of 20 and 24 . His middle son received @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tear-gas cannister at him at close range during a demonstration. // The elder Mr. Hammad has no doubts that in the fading of his generation of Palestinian nationalists the Israelis have missed their best chance for a peaceful settlement with the Palestinians. // " My sons are very different from my generation , " he said . " They did not witness the Arab defeat of 1967 , so they don ' t have any inferiority complexes . But most important , my sons believe that they can , by their actions , change the world . They are full of confidence . They are not smashed and frustrated like my generation. " // " When you talk about frustration in the West Bank , " Mr. Hamad said , " don ' t include the young people . It is we , the over-40 crowd , who are the frustrated ones . But I tell you , if the Israelis are going to negotiate , they should do it with the Jamil Hammads . Otherwise they will have their hands full with my boys Haitham , Suhail and Sadir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concessions . " <> <> Fathers Are ' Radicalized ' // But while the young generation has indeed taken to the streets in a way many of their fathers never did , one should not think that their fathers are not rooting them on , said Sari Nusseibeh , a philosopher in Bir Zeit University on the West Bank and the father of two boys , 11 and 8. // " What you have today , " Mr. Nusseibeh said , " is fathers being radicalized by their sons . I could not help but watch the scenes by our house of young boys burning tires in the road without thinking of a Phoenix rising from the ashes. " // " As soon as the clashes began around our house , my sons ran up to the roof with binoculars and reported on the ' battle , " he added . " Every time the Israelis pulled back , they shouted ' The Palestinians are winning , the Palestinians are winning . ' Suddenly I saw them both with one foot out the door . Once they get out there , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are entering a whole new countryside . This is only the beginning . " Indeed , Mr. Karaeen said , fewer Israelis come by the house these days . His children have no friends on the other side . <> <> A Contaminated Atmosphere // " With all of this uprising going on , it is hard to tell a 7-year-old the whole story - that there are good and there are bad and that we have some Jewish friends , " Mr. Karaeen said . " Even if I did , he hears other things at school now . He will never have the same experience as me . The atmosphere now is so contaminated . But to know a different reality and not be able to impart it to your own son , that is very painful. // " If this continues , in a few years there will be no dialogue at all , " he predicted . " We , the fathers , are all asking ourselves , ' How will our children judge us - as cowards , as nationalists , as realists ? ' // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then I am afraid they will judge me negatively . Did my way of life bring anything positive for them ? The answer will be no , and they will judge me as having been mistaken . Nothing could be more embarrassing for a father. " // When the moderate nationalists of his generation were still ruling the West Bank as mayors or in other leadership positions , Mr. Karaeen said , they were a buffer between Israel and the more extremist and religious fundamentalists among the Palestinians . When a disturbance happened , they would mediate between the Israeli authorities and the youths to calm things down. // But now this buffer group has been expelled or dismissed . In the last two weeks when the Israeli Army called in the Palestinian leaders they appointed in place of the moderate nationalists in the West Bank and told them to cool things down , these " leaders " were not able to exert any influence . <> <> No Peace in Own Homes // " Now all the Israelis have to talk to are people who can not even bring peace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " They talk with fathers who have no connections with their sons. " // " To talk politics , you need politicians , but they have not left any , " he said . " When they arrested all these people last week , they said they were just arresting the ' organizers . ' One thousand organizers ? In 10 years they will just have to put a wall up around the whole West Bank and Gaza Strip to arrest all of the organizers. " // So what is left ? For his generation , too old to fight and too wise not to appreciate the shades of gray , only cynicism is left , Mr. Karaeen said. // " The process my generation went through has left us cynics , " he said . " The process our sons are going through has left them as radicals . The end result in both cases is dangerous. " // " My way of life at least had a ray of hope in it - a hope that was aborted , " he added . " Our sons ' way of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
