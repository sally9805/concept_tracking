THE TALK , OF THE TOWN Notes and Comment IN future generations  --  if any  --  some historian of our period may find it worthy of a footnote that during the weekend preceding the President 's State of the Union Message viewers of television had the experience of being told by at least five normally sensible and reliable political commentators dint under certain far from inconceivable circumstances the United States might shortly open nuclear hostildes with the Soviet Union . The five commentators  --  Jack Nelson , of the Los Angeles Times , who appeared on " Washington Week in Review ; " and Hugh Sidey , of Time , and the syndicated columnists George Will , Carl Rowan , and fames Kilpatrick , who all appeared on " Agronsky and Company " ? were persuaded that if the Soviet Union should proceed from its invasion of Afghanistan to intervention in Iran , the United States , faced with a Soviet takeover of the Middle East 's oil fields but lacking the conventional military means to do anything about it , might resort to the threat or the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these warnings of war , an article in Sunday 's Washington Post , by Richard Whalen , announced that " World War III " had already begun . Ail that was left was for the United States to acknowledge it . Since future generations  --  assuming their existence , for the moment  --  will probably take a lively interest in how we , as gatekeepers of the human future , handled our nuclear responsibilities , it might be helpful for a member of this generation to set down a few observations on what it was like sitting around over the weekend thinking about the proverbially unthinkable " World War III . " The phrase is in quotes here because in the circumstances each element of it sounded wrong , for one reason or another . " World " was misleading , because by implication it left the impres-sion that after World War HI there would necessarily still he a world . " War " was inappropriate , because historically wars have been fought for war " aims , " but all imaginable war " aims " would be nullified in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it was suggested , might wage war to obtain supplies of oil , but of what use would the oil he without a nation to consume it ? The numeral " III " was misleading , because it falsely suggested some similarity between nuclear " war " ? a convulsion of meaningless destruction that would lie over in half an hour and World War I and World War H , which were actual wars , involving military campaigns and the like , and lasting several years each . The numeral " III " also carried the same unfounded implication as the word " world , " for it suggested a continuing numerical series , with a possible IV and V to follow , whereas in actuality the series , together with the world itself , might end at III . It is this likelihood , weighing unceasingly on the minds of all responsible statesmen , that makes the nuclear age so different from any other . The phrase " go to war " was also used on television and in the press that weekend , and it , too , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would go to war ; war would come to us , in a twinkling , finding us at our breakfast tables , or in the bath , or on our way to work . Although the peril was in one sense remote  --  as far away as Afghanistan  --  it was also all around us and in us , among the coffee cups and in the silences of our conversations . Among other things that we Americans felt was a dim and helpless anger that somehow we and our families and Friends and everyone and everything we saw about us had been judged expendable by someone , somewhere . What was particularly strange was that while it seemed impossible that anyone could ever decide that the world was expendable ( expendable for what ? ) , just this eventuality was now being discussed , without any signs of astonishment or dread , by the television commentators , who , having talked over a few strategic points , passed on smoothly to other subjects . At times during the weekend , some of us found that we were afraid , but ultimately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the occasion . The incommensurability between the weakness of our faculties and the boundlessness of what they were being asked to apprehend simply could not be bridged . Instead of fear , or any other feeling suitable to great danger , we experienced , in the end , a feeling of mental and emotional defeat in the face of something that was perhaps unthinkable but was not , it seemed , un-doable . The Forest of Arden SOMEBODY should notify Community Board No. 3 about the sudden arrival of the Forest of Arden , complete with pebble-filled pool , rustic footbridge , and real trees , on East Fourth Street between Second Avenue and the Bowery -- an event that has greatly improved the block without rezoning and has had a positive environmental impact on the neighborhood . The Forest , which is inhabited by a rather odd group of people -- -shepherds , shepherdesses , a young woman who pretends to be a man , a young man who hangs verses on trees , an old duke , a wise fool , and a melancholy philosopher  --  is , of course , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and its appearance in such an unlikely spot is the work of Andrei Serban , the young Rumanian director , who has just produced the play for the La Mama Experimental Theatre Club . Since Mr. Serban 's concept involved pulling his audience physically into the heart of this enchanting Elizabethan comedy , the enormous , high-ceilinged playing space of the La Mama Annex has been converted into an ingenious double set . We attended a preview , and , after climbing a flight of back stairs , took a seat somewhat precariously at the top of a steep bank of wooden bleachers that had been constructed at one end of the hall . Below us stood a canvas set painted with the square pink towers and pninted Venetian windows of a mythical Renaissance city , and here , a few minutes later , Orlando and Charles wrestled and Rosalind and Celia hatched their plans to run away from the ducal court . When the action moved to the Forest of Arden , the city was folded up to reveal a vast sunken playing space backed by a shimmering silver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and lots of large green trees in movable pots . ( If a tree interfered with the audience sight lines , one of the actors simply wheeled it to another spot . ) About two-thirds of the way through the play ( after the Phebe-Silvius dalliance that ends Act III ) , the actors invited the audience to walk through the Forest and finish the evening seated on benches and cushions around the edge . Having taken the walk , to the accompaniment of vaguely medieval music played on a guitar , a cello , a flute , and assorted percussion instruments , and seated ourself on a square red pad near the pool , we found that the sudden intimate contact with the actors  --  they were rarely more than six or seven feet away  --  gave us the odd feeling that we had moved inside the Elizabethan world and were looking back at a receding twentieth-century landscape . The " As You Like It " characters , who were dressed in a splendid assortment of thrift-shop bits and pieces ( Serban had adopted the scholarly thesis that the duke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , became acquaintances . The elaborate Shakespearean language began to sound more and more like natural speech . The next day , we returned to the . theatre to ask Mr. Serban  --  a tall , thin blond man in his early thirties  --  how he had achieved this particular theatrical effect . He told us that he had chosen " As You Like It " for the experiment because it was a work of great inner harmony . " It celebrates love and generosity in man , and it 's very important that we remember and cherish these ancient values , " he said softly , in accented English . " They have been in us all the time , but we seldom have the chance to experience them suddenly and directly . The act of theatre is an act of creation that should take place between the actors and the audience , and the moment that this happens is in the performance itself . And so the actors must transmit some kind of very direct experience to the audience . In this play , I think , the message @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within us to live our lives more completely than we do . I 'm not communicating that idea directly . It 's just that at the end we try to send an energy , a vibration of intensified life , out to everybody in the room . This kind of shared experience is something that we are all thirsty for and , too often , are missing . " Serban continued , " Usually , when I go to the theatre , either I receive a play in the head  --  I get the ideas , I understand the message  --  or I 'm moved , so that I receive it in my heart , my feelings , my senses . But it 's rare to receive a theatrical event in the mind and in the emotions and the senses at the same time . Therefore , I 've staged As You Like It ' to try to take an audience from all sides . If we 're successful , your mind works , your heart works , your senses work . And you feel alive . Technically , the problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find a pace for the play , and also a free form that gives the actors a chance to discover something in their lines that is alive and different with each performance . As you could observe last night , it often seemed almost as if they were making it up as they went along . The problem is how to preserve this quality . " We asked Mr. Serban if it had taken a long time to develop that approach to Shakespeare , and he explained that although he had mounted this production in three weeks , the basic ideas had been worked out in two previous productions of " As You Like It . " " The first one was done three years ago in La Rochelle , France , as a project sponsored by the French government , " he said . " We presented the play in English , using American actors , to a largely French-speaking audience , and we used a completely natural setting . We started in a village just outside La Rochelle , playing the first acts in a square in front of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the musicians and the audience  --  walked a mile in a kind of medieval procession to an actual forest , where we played the scenes with the runaways in a setting of real trees , real grass , and real sky . The second production , which was done last spring in the beautiful Greek theatre at Taormina , was a little more circumscribed by geography . I could n't march the audience very far in any direction or I 'd have sent them over the edge of a rather steep cliff . " Compliance THE new , portable indoor running track at Madison Square Garden has a plywood surface and a plywood infield , and the whole thing has been painted in shades of orange , blue , red , and yellow to match the colors of the seats in the arena . It was set up the other day for its debut , at the Vitalis/ U.S. Olympic Invitational track-and-field meet , and it looked great . About twenty carpenters and laborers began working on a Friday night , right after the Knicks lost their sixth of seven in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ court and carted it away , and then they brought in the track , which comes in two hundred and twenty-seven pieces . Ten hours later , they were finished . Ten hours after that , a runner named Fred Sowerby , competing in a five-hundred-metre race , set an American indoor record . The turns of the track arc banked in such a way that the angle of the first , or inside , lane is steeper than that of the fourth , or outermost , lane . Usually , anyone who tries to walk around the inside curve falls off , but a runner can avoid this embarrassment . Anyone who can move fast enough to stay on for eleven laps will have travelled sixteen hundred metres  --  a shade less than a mile . It 's conceivable that eventually the new track at the Garden will become known as the fastest indoor track in the world . Thomas A. McMahon , a professor of biomechanical engineering at Harvard , who helped design the track  --  and who in the course of his research has been known to put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Go , puppy ! Yeah , go , go ! , " and film the procedure  --  wo n't say exactly what it is about the new track that makes it so special . He does , however , drop cryptic hints . Recently , we read an article by McMahon and an associate  --  Peter R. Greene , a postdoctoral fellow at Harvard  --  that was published in Scientific American and was titled " Fast Running Tracks . " The authors included some photographs and diagrams with captions like " At mid-stance , when the body has traveled a distance of half a step length , the contact leg is flexed , that is , shortened by a distance of 8o , which is taken to he independent of the track compliance . Hence on a hard surface , which has step length Lu , the distance from the hip to the track surface is /-So . On a compliant surface , however ... " And so forth . In other words , in the interests of science Greene and McMahon do n't mind a little obfuscation . Basically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out how to design running tracks so that superior athletes running on them will go as fast as possible . Floyd Highfill has been trying to figure out the same thing . Mr. Highfill is a chemist with the New Mexico Department of Agriculture , in Las Cruces . When he is n't occupied with New Mexico agriculture , he builds running tracks . His designs emphasize getting a runner from the straightaway into a turn and back to the straightaway with maximum efficiency . He built his first track in 1964 , in Albuquerque , and has worked on fifteen others since . When Peter Greene and Thomas McMahon planned their first track  --  an indoor track that opened at Harvard in 1977 ? they tried to design something with optimum compliance . A surface with optimum compliance is flexible in a way that gives a runner the ideal amount of spring with each step he takes . Poured concrete is not compliant enough ; pillows are too compliant . Some people at Madison Square Garden who had heard both of High-fill and of Greene and McMahon decided to wed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other day that the optimally compliant new track at the Garden contains " fibre glass and other exotic materials " in its support structure . When we asked him to tell us more about the exotic materials , he said , " Sorry , I ca n't . Patents pending . " When we asked Highfill how he thought the collaboration had worked out , he said , " My first thought was that I 've never especially liked Easterners and I 've been in this business for a long time and here are two guys from Harvard trying to horn in . " But he smiled in a way that indicated that , upon reflection , he had n't had to suffer too much . Then he excused himself to go hack to work . By eight o'clock on Saturday morning , the infield was still unfinished , but only one curve of the track , a section about twenty-five yards long , remained to he erected . Peter Greene , who was on hand more to observe than to advise ( McMahon had n't been able to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " The exciting part is about to happen . Floyd 's warehouse in Las Cruces is n't big enough for him to put the whole thing together . So now we 'll see whether it lines up right . " Highfill and Malcolm Shaw , a shop steward who was one of a crew of carpenters , supervised the operation , and in time the very last section , an eight-foot arc , was lifted with grappling hooks and set down in the very last gap . Four inches of it overlapped an adjacent section . " We 're gon na try to move this back , " Shaw announced . " We need the heavy hitters here , " said Ted Bieniewicz , a red-haired carpenter , who looked like a heavy hitter himself . The crew spread out along the inside of the curve , gripping about twenty feet of track . " O , K. Ready . HIT ! " said Shaw . The carpenters gave a mighty push , and the entire curve budged about an inch . He took a deep breath . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fell into place , where it could he bolted and secured . " Ai n't nature wonderful ? " said Bieniewicz . There was still a couple of hours ' worth of levelling to do  --  lining up the seams , and slipping shims beneath the two-by-four wedges that held up the banked turns  --  hut Highfill and Greene seemed relieved . We wandered around the infield with Highfill and watched as a couple of heavy hitters , swinging rubber sledgehammers , banged the plywood in various spots to get the entire apparatus aligned properly . We asked , " Does n't it bother you to see these guys hitting your track with sledgehammers ? " " It 's not my track anymore , " High-fill said , " It 's Madison Square Garden 's . " ? UCH is this country 's current pre ' , " occupation with sports that within hours of our visit to Madison Square Garden we received the following message from a woman we know : I was roped into watching the Super Bowl XIV game last Sunday , because I accepted in good faith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to arrive and find the chairs , the bar , the eats , and the other guests lined up in front of the television set . Well . What I know about football is whatever I picked up in school and college when I went to football games because of the boys rather than because of any passion for the game . I understand the point of the exercise , and I have a rudimentary grasp of downs . Here 's what else I knew at the start of Super Bowl XIV : the Rams were the underdogs , and are owned by Mrs. Rosenbloom , who was a showgirl , and who fired her stepson , Steve , after Mr , Rosenbloom 's death ; a Rams player named Wendell Tyler is inclined to fumble the ball ; one of the Rains players writes poetry ; a pre-med student named Ferragamo plays quarterback for the Rams , and was considered a weak link in the team , because of his inexperience ; he also gets nervous playing in front of his parents ; the Steelers are owned by Art Rooney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a very fine quarterback named Terry Bradshaw . The players ' names alone are enough to win you over to the game  --  the variety that makes one proud of this country . Stall-worth , jodat , Bnidzinski , Waddy , Saul , O'Steen , a pair of YoungbloodsNabokov could n't have drawn up a more authentic roster . ( I particularly liked the name Frank O'Harris , but eventually discovered my mistake . ) And the Rams ' coach is no slouch , either , when it comes to names : Ray mond() Guiseppi Giovanni Baptiste Malavasi ( Ray to his friends ) . Things got off to a good start with Art Rooney being driven onto the field in a magnificent blue touring car , a 1933 Duesenberg in perfect condition . No sign of Mrs. Rosenbloom . Then a young woman with the voice of a nineteen-forties chanteuse in some night spot out in the boonies sang " The Star-Spangled Banner . " This was a surprise . I had always thought that at these events the national anthem would be sting by a very square tenor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No electric organ , either . When the players finally ran out on the field , I was reminded not of gladiators but of Brobdingnagians , with a touch of " Star Wars " added . Their size , weight , protective gear , and helmets , the black smudges under the eyes , and the Steelers ' black jerseys made it all quite unreal until one of the players got hurt and threw up . When the camera 's eye looked down on the Rose Bowl , it might as well have been one of those electric football games that children play . The Rams did so well in the first half that some of my co-guests began making intricate and mysterious bets based on points . It is relevant that the Rams were " eleven-point underdogs . " I was impressed to discover that those who really know about football are able to carry on a conversation about caucuses or Italian wine and miss nothing on the screen . Even though I concentrated on the game , if my eyes were on the tight man at the right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have played big-time football in his youth , and was a wellspring of information . Real grass is more slippery than artificial turf , but artificial turf is a hazard because the players catch their cleats in it . The cameras do n't pan to the cheerleaders waving those pompons unless the game is boring . The medical bulletins on the injured are low-key because sometimes one of the injured shows up again , all taped and with the injury shot full of something , so he can carry on -- which he wants to do . All major-league football players hurt everywhere all the time . After they retire , they hurt all the time only where there is a serious old injury . When a player is tackled , it is a good thing if he can manage to curl into a ball , because the convexity of the hack acts as a shield , like a tortoise 's shell particularly when there are nine people on top of one . There was a heated discussion both in the Bowl and in the room over an official 's call in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of you have done this ? You go to wash your hands and there 's this piece of spinach stuck in the soap . Right ? Right ? And how about this ? You fall out of bed in the middle of the night and when you wake up you ca n't figure out why the ceiling is so far away and the only logical explanation is that you 've suddenly become the incredible shrinking man . Right ? Recognize that one ? Huh ? Am I hitting home ? Huh ? Huh ? " ? fourth quarter . Then out came the Terrible Towels , beloved by Steelers fans for reasons that were never explained , and the game was over . It was noted that Terry Bradshaw was voted Most Valuable Player , that Wendell Tyler may have been half killed but did not fumble the ball , and that Ferragamo did not blow it even though his parents were at the game . All present agreed that the pre-med student does not look like a Greek god but , instead , looks like an Italian god out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watch Super Bowl XV .
