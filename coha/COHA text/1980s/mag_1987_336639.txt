At exactly 2:40 a.m. last Tuesday , under the orange glow of a crescent moon , a small group of scientists gathered expectantly at an archaeological site south of the Great Pyramid of Cheops at Giza , just outside Cairo . They did not carry hand picks or shovels . Instead , they watched a TV monitor as a miniature camera was lowered into a narrow hole in the ground . When the video image flickered to life , the group gasped . There before them , inside a chamber that had been sealed 4,600 years ago , lay the dismantled timbers of a wooden ship . The archaeologists immediately recognized it as the long-sought companion to the famous royal ship of Cheops that now resides in a Giza museum . <P> The dramatic find was a triumph of space-age technology and archaeological investigation . The existence of the sister ship had been suspected since 1954 , when the first vessel was discovered near the tomb of the Fourth Dynasty Pharaoh Cheops , or Khufu . Work at the new site began two weeks ago . The trick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including the 4,600-year-old air that might reveal secrets of the ancient atmosphere . <P> Bob Moores , a Black &; Decker engineer who helped design a lunar-surface drill for the Apollo program , mated one of his company 's drills with an ingenious air-lock seal . An industrial vacuum cleaner at the site sucked the dust from around the hole once the drilling got under way . To see inside the vault , technicians modified a miniature remote-controlled video camera so it could be inserted into the 3 1/2-in. - wide entrance hole . The camera , originally designed to probe the interior of nuclear reactors , provided fiber- optic light without introducing any heat into the chamber . Over the site was a makeshift scaffold and the flags of Egypt and the National Geographic Society , the principal sponsor of the $250,000 project . <P> For three days the scientists drilled , an inch at a time . Last Monday morning , 62 in. into the porous limestone , the carbide-tipped drill broke through . Pieter Tans , a research scientist from the University of Colorado in Boulder , filled six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He also took a sniff . Said Tans : " I did not smell history . I did n't smell anything , except maybe staleness . " <P> The inside of the chamber remained a mystery until early the next morning , when the video camera was finally lowered into place . What the scientists saw &; on the monitor looked like a pile of lumber under reed matting . Even so , recalled Tans , " as soon as we saw it , we knew it was a boat . " Tohamy Mahmoud Ali , an Egyptian worker who had helped excavate the first vessel , broke into excited Arabic as he recognized the disassembled ship lying in its narrow pit . At one end were several upright pieces , perhaps parts of the prow .
