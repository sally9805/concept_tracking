After the Boston fire department rejected them because of poor exam scores in 1975 , identical twins Philip and Paul Malone did not think of giving up . Back they went in 1977 with new applications and a new strategy : they declared that they were black . As such , the Malones were hired by the department , which was under pressure to take on more minority firemen . Under a court-ordered affirmative action plan , it no longer mattered that the brothers , with exam scores of 57% and 69% , fell far short of the passing grade of 82% required for whites . <P> For ten years no one officially questioned the Malones ' self-proclaimed blackness . Then in February the twins were put on a list of blacks among firemen proposed for promotion to lieutenant . The list went to fire commissioner Leo Stapleton . He knew the Malones were the department 's only identical twins , and if they were n't white , it was news to him . Stapleton asked the state 's department of personnel administration to check out the twins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black city councilman Bruce Bolling : " How could twins with Irish names , Caucasian features and no black identification from any perspective get onto the force and stay on without collusion ? " <P> Good question , especially since the fair-haired , fair-skinned Malones had identified themselves as white on their first applications . Eventually the twins , now 33 , claimed that they did not learn they were black until 1976 , when , they say , their mother discovered a sepia photograph of a pale-looking woman she said was their black great-grandmother . Last month , after an investigation of their claim , they were fired . <P> The dismissal , which the Malones have appealed to the State Supreme Judicial Court , has Boston churning . Amid rumors that there have been other phony claims of minority status , mayor Ray Flynn ordered a review of the hiring practices in the fire and school departments . Two weeks ago , Flynn disclosed that at least five other fire fighters will be asked to prove they are not white .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
