Man of the Year <P> To the Editors : Deng Xiaoping as Man of the Year is your best choice ever MAN OF THE YEAR , Jan. 6 . Deng is proving again , as the U.S. did many years ago , that the most powerful and beneficial force in the world is individual freedom and enterprise . James Sumner Sedona , Ariz . <P> Yours is the finest report on events in China since Marco Polo 's . Jn Gadzo Chisholm , Minn . <P> TIME 's choice is ludicrous . It would be much more appropriate to have on your cover the silhouette of a lone terrorist , symbolizing the murder and carnage that occurred in 1985 . Dale K. Weighill Farmington , Mich . <P> Congratulations on your selection of Deng Xiaoping as Man of the Year . While the choice of Mikhail Gorbachev would have had obvious merit , your arguments for deciding to pick Deng were too persuasive to ignore . Timothy A. VanDerbosch Garrett , Ind . <P> You say that if " Deng 's bold experiments " succeed , " Communists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an alternative to the failures of Soviet Marxism . " Yet you say that " Deng 's goal is to lift per capita income to $800 by the year 2000 . " This is less than 20% of per capita income in the U.S.S.R. today and less than 10% of that in some East European countries . Soviet-style Marxism is a failure only by Western standards . Compared with the mess that China is in after 35 years under Deng and his associates , the Soviet Union is Nirvana . Thomas A. Metzger Professor of Chinese History University of California , San Diego La Jolla , Calif . <P> As a Taiwanese , I am both shocked and disappointed at this year 's selection for Man of the Year . Choosing Deng Xiaoping primarily because of his " sweeping economic reforms " focuses only on the brighter side of China . By honoring Deng , you praise a leader who has tried to isolate Taiwan , an emerging democracy ; has sheltered Pol Pot , a genocidal maniac ; has continued to deny basic human rights to Tibetans ; and has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on democracy for Hong Kong . When admiring the sleek , beautiful head of the mighty Chinese dragon emerging from the depths of the Pacific , keep a sharp eye for the shadowy tail that is sure to follow . Dave Lin Marlboro , N.J. <P> Your choice of Deng Xiaoping is a just one . Deng has transformed China from a restless Communist giant to a peaceful nation committed to stability and cooperation . Mao 's two upheavals , the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution , caused millions of Chinese misery and death ; Deng 's changes have brought joy and happiness . Now China , the erstwhile protagonist of socialist revolution , and the U.S. , the greatest capitalist country , have become friends . For that , Deng deserves a Nobel Peace Prize . Mahmood Elahi Washington <P> Last September the Chinese government celebrated the 20th anniversary of the carving up of Tibet . To observe the occasion , a delegation of Chinese officials flew from Peking to Lhasa armed with gifts of silk , desk clocks and tea . Tibetans do not need desk clocks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their rights , their cultural identity and their national leaders . As the eldest brother of His Holiness the Dalai Lama , I can tell you that Tibetans are waiting for these reforms before they will nominate Deng Xiaoping Man of the Year .
