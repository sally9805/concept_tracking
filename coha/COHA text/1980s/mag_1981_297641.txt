In Lynn , Mass. , buildings and dreams go up in smoke <P> Brian Magrane , 38 , chairman of the Economic Development Industrial Corporation in Lynn , Mass. ( pop . 78,741 ) , was feeling proud and elated as he drove home in the wee hours . His high school class reunion earlier that night had been a rousing success , and in three days a contract was to be signed for the final phase of his proudest achievement : a fiveyear , $194 million renewal of Lynn 's downtown . Vast , empty Victorian brick factories , relics of the Lynn 's long reign as " Shoe Capital " of the nation , were being recycled to serve a reawakening city as offices , stores , apartments and classrooms . But as he drove along Boston Street , Magrane was seized with panic . " I saw flames and said , ' Oh , my God , what 's that ? ' " <P> What Magrane saw was the core of the urban renewal area engulfed by fire . The blaze skipped from building to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fighters converged from 91 communities in Massachusetts and nearby New Hampshire to battle the fire and to evacuate 750 residents . By the time Fire Chief Joseph Scanlon declared the conflagration under control at 4:55 p.m. , four city blocks-about 6 acres-had been devastated . The losses : 17 buildings leveled , nine more badly damaged ; 37 businesses providing 1,500 jobs burned out ; $50 million in real estate ruined , plus $20 million or more in business and personal property ; 400 people left homeless . No one was killed or even seriously injured . But the psychological blow was heavy . Lynn had lost jobs in industries ranging from shoemaking to jet-engine manufacture , and more than 20% of its population , since World War II . The renewal plan had offered the first plausible hope of reversing that all-too-common decline . Said Lynn Mayor Antonio Marino : " It was like watching my heart being cut out . We lost the momentum of the complete revitalization of the city . " <P> The blackened wrecks of buildings , eerily smoldering in spots for days afterward , reminded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Said Scanlon : " It looks like Berlin in 1945 . " Others thought of the awesome spectacles of nature . Lamented U.S. Senator Paul Tsongas after a somber tour : " This is a miniature Mount St. Helens . " <P> Equally sobering was the assessment of city and state inspectors that the fire was probably caused by arson . The circumstantial evidence was persuasive . There had been three previous fires of suspicious origin within two weeks , all of them next door to the building where officials believe the blaze began . But baffled investigators could find no rational motive : the building belonged to a state-chartered development agency , and was minimally insured . Dejected Lynn leaders can take heart from the example of Chelsea , Mass. ( pop . 25,431 ) , just five miles southwest . In October 1973 a fire there destroyed 360 buildings over 18 city blocks . Now 65% of the fire site has been rebuilt , and the rest is scheduled for new development .                 @ @ @ @
