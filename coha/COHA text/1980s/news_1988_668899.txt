Had there been lights in Wrigley Field last June 13 , a retired couple might not now be in Cook County Jail , charged with being members of a Miami- to-Chicago cocaine smuggling operation uncovered , in part , by a Tennessee state trooper who is an avid Cubs fan . The couple , George Sloss , 58 , and his wife , Goldie , 53 , of Tavernier , Fla. , are being held on bonds of $3 million each . They face a court hearing March 1 on charges of drug trafficking and calculated criminal drug conspiracy . Officials of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration say they were part of a ring that funneled huge quantities of cocaine to Chicago from Miami monthly . Illinois State Police investigators arrested the Slosses at a Rosemont motel Feb. 6 , allegedly as the couple sold 10 kilograms of cocaine to an undercover agent posing as a drug dealer . Unlikely drug suspects , the Slosses have no known arrest record . Indeed , police said everything about them suggested a life of quiet middle-class retirement . George , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a supervisor at a Pittsburgh steel business . Goldie , a cancer patient , dotes on the couple ' s two grandchildren , friends said . Their arrests were the result of an investigation that was aided when Tennessee State Trooper Terry Thomas intercepted a load of cocaine valued at $2. 4 million in Chattanooga , Tenn. - and that occurred because Thomas knew that the Cubs don ' t play baseball at night in Chicago , authorities said . The trooper had stopped a car for speeding on Int . Hwy. 24 near Chattanooga in a rainstorm last June 12 and found 26 pounds of cocaine hidden in pillows in the car . He arrested the occupants , Ramon Pino and Silvero Llero , both of Miami , who are now serving prison terms . Thomas said he might not have searched the car were it not for Pino ' s answer to a routine question of where he and Llero were going in such a hurry in a rainstorm . " Pino told me he and his friend were ' real big baseball fans ' and had to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watch the Cubs play in Wrigley Field , " Thomas said . " When I heard that I thought maybe I ' d missed something in the sports pages ; that the Cubs had put in lights for night games . But then I remembered the Cubs weren ' t even in Chicago that weekend . They were on the road against the ( St. Louis ) Cardinals . " After the cocaine was seized in June , narcotics smugglers shifted tactics to safeguard future shipments , federal drug officials say . The " mules " or cocaine couriers , until then usually male Hispanics , were replaced , as were the rented cars they usually drove , in the smugglers ' attempt to avoid detection by a group of police and federal agents who had banded together in an investigation called Operation Pipeline . The investigation was aimed at interstate drug operations . " Enter the Slosses , driving their own pickup truck with a Florida sheriff ' s-supporter sticker on the bumper , " said Lt. David Hamm of the Illinois State Police , whose Division of Criminal Investigation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couple and confiscate the cocaine , valued at $3 million . Authorities said the investigation is continuing in Florida . Authorities said Pino ' s wife , Isis Alvarez-Pino , of Miami , and the Slosses became acquainted after the Slosses moved to Florida . George Sloss was a neighborhood handyman who repaired bicycles and lawnmowers and did odd jobs for Mrs. Pino ' s friends . In the process , he met Mrs. Pino . After Ramon Pino was arrested and sentenced to 10 years in prison , Mrs. Pino recruited the Slosses as cocaine couriers , authorities said . Mrs. Pino was arrested in Florida on the same day as the Slosses on charges that she arranged for the sale of the cocaine , which investigators said the Slosses delivered at her instruction to someone who turned out to be an undercover agent in Illinois . Investigators said the Slosses are suspected of hauling illegal drugs as far west as California in their now-confiscated 1988 Toyota pickup with a coach camper , and possibly in other vehicles.             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
