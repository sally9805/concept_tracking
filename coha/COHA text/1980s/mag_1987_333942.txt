18 Woman of the Year : President Corazon Aquino <P> The new Philippine leader came to power on a wing and a prayer , toppling one of the world 's most durable dictators as well as a whole volume of political assumptions . Her platform in a snap election was little more than faith , hope and charity . But after widespread voting fraud , the army revolted , and the masses went into the streets to back her in a demonstration of People Power . Once she was in office , the neophyte yet again confounded expectations with unanticipated toughness and political skill . In the process of both the revolution and her first year in office , she has restored the pride of her people and has become a hero for women around the world . Nonetheless , in ruling her troubled country , she still faces a myriad of problems , including a weak economy , restless armed forces and a Communist insurgency . <P> 26 <P> Decision to Challenge Marcos <P> As the reluctant candidate went through a crash course on campaign issues with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up her mind whether to run . <P> 32 <P> A Christmas Conversation <P> After ten months in office , Aquino reflects on life in power and also the people and events that most influenced her as she made her way to Malacanang Palace . <P> 35 <P> Others Who Stood in History 's Spotlight <P> White House Adviser Oliver North , Soviet Leader Mikhail Gorbachev and South Africa 's Nelson and Winnie Mandela left their stamp on the year just past . <P> 38 <P> Nation <P> The Administration debates a plan to help Americans deal with catastrophic illness .  --  Furor over a racist attack in Queens . <P> 50 <P> World <P> !
