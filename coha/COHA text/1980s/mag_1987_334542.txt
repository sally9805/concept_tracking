It is a cold , gray day in Philadelphia , and the furnace in the drafty old Commodore Barry Club can push the temperature only to about 50 degrees F , but the musicians just button their overcoats tighter , blow on their hands and take out their instruments . After all , it is n't every day that so many of their kind  --  20 , at least  --  gather in one place . In a musical subculture so arcane that few even know it exists , this counts as a world-class event : the first East Coast Convention of Cumann na bPiobairi , the national Irish Pipers ' Club  --  and what is a little discomfort ? The novices are eager to hobnob with such superstars as Al Purcell , from Detroit ; Bill Ochs , Jerry O'Sullivan and Matt Connolly , out of New York ; and Denis Brooks , all the way from Seattle . For the pros , it is a chance to trade techniques , tunes and gossip saved since they last met . <P> The word bagpipes conjures up an image @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mark . Unlike their strident , better known and more ancient Scottish cousins , the Irish ( or Uilleann ) bagpipes are soft and melodic ; their construction is different , and no one wears an ethnic costume for performances . Not that the Irish scorn the Highland pipes ; they play them too , on occasions like St. Patrick 's Day parades , but that is in part because the Irish pipes can not be played standing up . Besides , they are not very loud . The Scottish variety is challenging enough , but Uilleann pipes are in a class by themselves . They are difficult to obtain , harder to maintain and nearly impossible to play . <P> Indeed , Uilleann piping is so intimately linked with frustration and suffering that players consider themselves initiates in what approaches a religion . According to tradition , it takes " seven years ' listening , seven years ' practicing and seven years ' playing to make a piper , " but the reward is mastery of a difficult physical skill , plus the experience of creating one 's own musical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something like a bassoon , and , when all the various parts are used , like several of each playing at once . <P> Even after 21 years , though , the suffering is not over . Uilleann pipes are fiendishly temperamental ; they can break down in dozens of ways without warning , and the prudent performer is always ready for a crisis . " Can anybody help me with this reed ? " calls out Sandy Jordan , a Virginia-accented neophyte and the only woman in a room filled with bearded young men . Timothy Britton , a piper , pipemaker and transcendental meditator , comes over to have a look . " The reed 's cracked , " he says after a quick inspection . " Here , try some Krazy Glue . " More trouble from across the room : a cigar-chewing piper , improbably named Roy Rogers Jr. , has a mysterious air leak . " Blow some smoke into the bag and see where it comes out , " advises Britton .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
