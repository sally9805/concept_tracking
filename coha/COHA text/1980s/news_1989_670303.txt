NEW YORK  --  Interest rates on bank certificates of deposit continued to climb last week but the yields still lagged behind those on Treasury bills . Banxquote Money Markets , a New York-based information service , said the average yield on three-month consumer CDs rose three hundredths of a percentage point in the latest week to 7. 54% . Consumer or savings CDs generally are certificates in denominations of less than $50 , 000 . Larger instruments are known as jumbo CDs and typically pay higher rates . At Tuesday ' s auction the annualized yield on three-month Treasury bills rose to 8. 36% from 8. 24% . " Banks eventually will catch up and offer rates that are at least equivalent " because of competition from Treasury bills and from CDs sold by brokers , said Norberto Mehl , publisher of Banxquote . Tuesday ' s Treasury bill auction saw a surge of interest from individual investors . Mr. Mehl noted that New York banks already are becoming aggressive with CD rates . Citicorp ' s Citibank , for example , increased the yield on three-month CDs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 8. 06% from 7. 79% . Meanwhile , rates are unusually low in California , where the average yield on a three-month CD was just 6. 53% . Rates on bank certificates of deposit have been rising consistently since last summer and they rose across the board last week . The average yield on six-month certificates rose to 8. 08% from 8. 04% and on one-year maturities the average yield rose to 8. 40% from 8. 37% . ( The yield on six-month Treasury bills auctioned Tuesday rose to 8. 98% from 8. 86% last week . ) The increase in short-term CD rates indicates that banks will raise their prime lending rates soon , said Robert Heady , publisher of Bank Rate Monitor , a North Palm Beach , Fla. - based newsletter . Typically , banks raise this key lending rate by half a percentage point when short-term CD rates have risen a quarter of a percentage point , he said , to cover their increased cost of funds . According to Bank Rate Monitor ' s calculations , short-term CD rates are up about a fifth of a percentage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are rising two to three hundredths of a percentage point a week . Currently , the prime rate is 10. 5% . Long-term rates also rose . According to Banxquote , the average two-year CD was yielding 8. 49% , an increase from 8. 46% , and five-year certificates were up to an average 8. 75% from 8. 73% . The yields on short-term CDs offered by leading broker-dealers rose at a faster rate than those of banks . The average yield on one-year certificates edged higher than the comparable yield on Treasury bills , which already was true for three and six-month CDs sold by broker-dealers . Long-term yields declined slightly . Banxquote ' s Mr. Mehl said some broker-dealers didn ' t offer long-term certificates , bringing down the average . Three-month issues offered by broker-dealers yielded an average 8. 90% , up 13 hundredths of a percentage point , and the average yield on six-month instruments was 9. 12% , up from 8. 98% . One-year CDs offered by broker-dealers rose to 9. 30% from 9. 18% . Average yields on two-year and five-year certificates fell one hundredth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 28% , respectively .
