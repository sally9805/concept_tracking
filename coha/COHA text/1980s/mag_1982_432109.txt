 | As the Reagan administration gives state and local officials more sway over federal spending , investigators are bracing for a possible rise in corruption in the nation 's statehouses , city halls and county courthouses . The fear : With fewer controls on the money doled out by Washington , it may well be easier for officeholders to misuse funds ? and get away with it . Already , record numbers of crooked politicians and bureaucrats are being caught from coast to coast . In federal courts , 3.19 state and local officials were indicted and 219 convicted in 1980 ? almost 10 times as many as in 1970 . The 1981 total is expected to run even higher , in part because more than 100 current and former county officials have been convicted or have pleaded guilty in Oklahoma alone . The massive pattern of kickbacks uncovered there is described on page 44 . All told , nearly 1,400 persons on state and local payrolls have been found guilty of corruption in the last 11 years , almost twice as many as the ' number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and simple , " says Larry Burris of the Mississippi Ethics Commission . " So many officials are put in a position to be tempted . One time , it 's $10 ; the next , $10,000 . A man 's mind gets clouded when money is thrust in front of him . " Assorted temptations . Some of the corruption cases involve accusations of outright theft of government money s New Mexico authorities are preparing charges that officeholders embezzled up to 1 million dollars in state fuel aid intended for low-income persons . The first to be formally accused is a Santa Fe official charged with pocketing $30,000 earmarked for firewood . Robert Parker , a top fiscal officer of the University of Illinois , faces charges of stealing $608,000 from the state-run school . Investigators claim that much of the money ? paid out as " monthly consultant fees , " according to university records ? was actually used to hire prostitutes . Howard Davey , a 30-year civil serJ.S.NEWS &; WORLD REPORT , Jan. 11 , 1982 vant who supervised collection of Denver 's sales tax , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bogus construction firms and taking the money himself . William Cabin , chief of staff to Lt. Gov . Mario Cuomo of New York , admitted that he had placed five fictitious names on his payroll and cashed the paychecks himself . The actions netted him about $175,000 that he said he needed to close a realestate deal in Albany . Two Benton Harbor , Mich. , officials were indicted on charges of embezzling federal funds . Mayor Joel Patterson was accused of taking $2,000 in federal housing funds ; City Attorney Kenneth Gavin of stealing $17,000 in U.S. small-business aid . The most common form of public corruption , however , is not stealing but taking bribes . Mississippi 's bank comptroller , James H. Means , was convicted of taking kickbacks in return for bank charters . Delaware State Senator William Murphy was found guilty of accepting $5,000 from a mobile-home dealer who needed ? and received ? the legislator 's support for legislation . In Cook County , Ill. , five officials who handled tax assessments were convicted in a plot to take bribes for making 80 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Pending in Michigan are charges  | that State Representative Casmer Ogonowski received $2,000 from a businessman in return for trying to help him acquire a state liquor license and a lottery-ticket machine . Not all bribery cases involve the purchase of favored treatment . Perhaps just as often , officials are accused of agreeing to wink at violations of the law when the price is right . Police Chief Chester Potter of Kearny , N.J. , and two officers were convicted of accepting $1,300 to protect a numbers operation . Sheriff James W. Rogers of Berkeley County , S.C. , the state 's former " Sheriff of the Year , " faces trial for allegedly collecting bribes from gamblers . Tax offenses by public officials are growing increasingly common . Illinois Atty . Gen. William Scott was forced to resign and was sentenced to 12 months in prison for understating his taxable income by $22,153 . Evidence was uncovered that Scott paid for foreign trips with campaign contributions not reported to federal tax authorities . Others run afoul of the law in their efforts to obtain public office . John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ohio , is serving a year in prison for failing to report more than $20,000 in campaign contributions from a firm to which he awarded more than 2 million dollars ' worth of work once he was in office . Campaign outlays are often hefty even in relatively minor races . Says Gerald McDowell , chief of the Justice Department 's public-integrity section : " People pay as much as $20 a vote for some of these obscure jobs so they will be in a position to administer ? and steal ? federal funds . They have to get elected first . " Experts cite several reasons for the  | flurry of corruption cases , ranging from the low salaries paid many public officials to the current poor economic conditions . " Inflationary pressure causes people to use public money for private purposes , " says Thomas Duffy , Jr. , a deputy attorney general of New York . " Everybody is facing inflation . People succumb . " Says federal prosecutor Mike Ruark of Seattle : " State legislators often receive a minimal salary in return for a tremendous workload @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the increase in prosecutions simply to more zeal by investigators . " I do n't think there 's more graft or corruption than before , " declares Wayne Calabrese , a Summit County , Ohio , prosecutor . " These illegal practices have been fairly well known and ignored for many years at all levels of government . What 's different now is that people are finally saying they 're fed up with it and want it to stop . " " Katie , bar the door . " The Reagan administration has won congressional approval to transfer about 6 billion dollars in federal funds to " block grants , " giving states and cities more power to decide how money is spent . The White House plans to seek a similar conversion of other programs involving billions of dollars more . Some analysts predict that with these changes will come more lawbreaking . Warns J. Terrence Bruner of Chicago 's Better Government Association . " It 's Katie , bar the door . ' If you 're going to give states more money with no strings , the corruption problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tend to have fewer resources to guard against fraud than does the federal government . " Even the best watchdog ideas are stymied by budget restraints , " says Rand Hendrickson , chief investigator for Denver 's district attorney . Reagan aides minimize the problem . They argue that states and cities simply will take over many federal auditing tasks . " State and local officials will have to answer at the ballot box if programs are not run well , " says Robin Raborn of the U.S. Office of Management and Budget . " In the past , they could blame Washington . " Even if wrongdoing by state and local officials gets no worse , it shows no sign of letting up any time soon . Says the Justice Department 's McDowell : " It 's depressing to see how pervasive corruption is . I think we have just scratched the surface . "  | Discovery of what may be the most sweeping statewide corruption scandal in U.S. history stemmed from a visit two years ago by federal tax agents to Dorothy Griffin 's barn in southeastern Oklahoma . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the years with many of the state 's 231 county commissioners , who make up a basic unit of local government . One of hundreds of officials and vendors under scrutiny in a kickback probe , Griffin led investigators to a gunnysack filled with more than 1 million dollars in fictitious invoices . She turned state 's evidence and identified others who had concocted similar schemes . Eventually , officeholders in most of the state 's 77 counties were implicated . The result so far : 150 persons have been convicted or have pleaded guilty , including 105 commissioners or former commissioners . " It has really been disillusioning , " says David Russell , chief federal prosecutor in Oklahoma . " You see the broad sweep of people involved , and you ask yourself whether the system is bad or whether humans are just corrupt . " Investigators say the commissioners who were charged practiced two kinds of fraud : Pocketing county funds for nonexistent transactions , and taking kickbacks of 10 percent or more on county purchases ? often paying inflated prices or buying unnecessary goods in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Damron and Jack Davis , submitted fake invoices for " purchases " of more than $200,000 in lumber ? enough to rebuild all the county 's bridges several times . The officials divided the take with lumber dealers . Another central Oklahoma commissioner , Albert A. Alberts , regularly took 10 percent kickbacks on supply purchases . He recently returned $27,000 to the county in an effort to persuade a judge to give him a light sentence . Oklahoma State Auditor Tom Daxon estimates that " tens of millions a year " have been squandered through fraudulent purchasing . He believes that because the tax money is collected by the state , commissioners came to believe that they " were not stealing from friends and neighbors but from a faceless bureaucracy at the state capital . " Oklahoma has recorded the largest number of convictions , but investigators are finding similar ripoffs in other states , including Arkansas , Mississippi , Tennessee and Texas . Lum Cumbest , a supervisor of Jackson County , Miss. , and a county-road foreman recently were found guilty of defrauding the county of $50,000 by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into reports of similar crimes . How can such fraud become so extensive ? Says District Attorney Michael Moore of Pascagoula , Miss. : " These supervisor-andcommission systems have the most powerful political organizations in the state behind them , and the laws governing them are too lax . " Reports Assistant U.S. Attorney Bill Price of Oklahoma City : " The commissioners were czars in charge of their own districts . There were no checks and balances . " Governor George Nigh has asked the Oklahoma Legislature to overhaul state purchasing laws . In the meantime , the replacement of dozens of convicted county commissioners already is getting results . Says State Auditor Daxon : " County bills have gone down , but it 's nothing like the cutthroat competition we 'll be seeing when this mess is cleared up . "
