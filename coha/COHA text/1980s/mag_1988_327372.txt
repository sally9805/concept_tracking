Pointing out that an affiliate of the Royal Dutch/Shell Group supplies fuel to South Africa 's army and police , the deejay has persuaded more than 1,000 listeners to cut up their Shell credit cards . <P> Laquidara won his biggest convert last week when Mayor Ray Flynn signed an order making Boston the first U.S. city to ban municipal purchases of Shell products . The move is largely symbolic : the city has done only $2,500 in business with Shell in two years .
