The two-alarm fire broke out in the second-floor office of a Washington public relations firm , spreading upward through the five-story building and causing $500,000 worth of damage . Arab Americans quickly pointed to a disturbing coincidence : two floors above , the offices of the American-Arab AntiDiscrimination Committee were also badly damaged , the latest in a series of violent actions affecting the organization . The Treasury Department 's Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco and Firearms is investigating the blaze . Commented one bureau spokesman : " Given the other attacks against the ADC and related Arab Americans , we are very concerned that it might have been directed against them . " <P> Former South Dakota Senator James Abourezk , founder and head of the ADC , agrees . The fire , he said last week , " must surely be linked " to two recent bombings aimed at his group . In August two Boston police officers were badly injured while trying to defuse a bomb found outside the ADC 's office . After the Achille Lauro hijacking in October , the ADC 's West @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after he appeared on Cable News Network saying it was time for Americans to " understand the Palestinian side of the story . " When he opened the door to the organization 's office in Santa Ana , Calif. , the following morning , he triggered an explosion that killed him . <P> Even before Abourezk registered his complaint , the FBI had begun to look for a wider connection . Characterizing the attack that killed Odeh as " terrorist , " an FBI spokesman said that the Jewish Defense League , a militant pro-Israel organization , is " the possible responsible group " for Odeh 's assassination as well as two separate bombings of suspected Nazis last summer . One of those blasts proved fatal : in Paterson , N.J. , Tscherin Soobzokov , 61 , a veteran of the Nazi Waffen SS , was injured by a bomb that detonated when he opened his front door . He died a month later . The Los Angeles Times has reported that the bombs used in all three cases were of similar design . The JDL has denied involvement in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late last week and turned over information pointing to suspects other than the JDL , although the former Senator says he has no firm idea who is behind the attacks . At the same time , his complaints about federal indifference have stirred further action : the Justice Department 's civil rights division announced last week it would investigate the attacks on the American-Arab group . Abourezk is now satisfied that the Government has committed adequate resources to the probe . Said he : " We were feeling goddamned alone out here . "
