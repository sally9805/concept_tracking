The rock-climbing class at Strathcona Park Lodge - a wilderness resort in the center of Vancouver Island - doesn ' t start out by having much to do with rocks . In the beginning you find yourself wobbling stoutheartedly across swaying logs , the cable just mentioned , and an assortment of rope ladders and logs that are mercifully stationary but placed at a daunting height from the ground. // Fortunately , stout hearts are what we have here . I have joined up with a visiting group of hikers from the Appalachian Mountain Club , middle-aged and older but as spunky as they come . They ' ve taken up rock climbing for the first time in their lives. // // One by one , with expressions of great determination under their protective hard hats , they assault the cable , with only a rope attached to a distant tree for balance. // The most common way of falling off is by abruptly pitching over backward . But really , pitching over backward is not that bad when a comrade throws his or her arms firmly about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it a very respectable halfway across. // Next the group takes on what could be described as the ' ' Army boot camp ' ' part of the course . ' ' It ' s all just a matter of clipping and unclipping , ' ' says our instructor , Paul , with a grin , as he attaches his safety harness to an overhead cable . He steps casually about , 12 feet above the forest floor : up a tree , along a log , along two parallel logs , a downward log . Then he takes a fairly long jump , negotiates a rope bridge , and finally climbs something called a spider ' s web - a ' ' ladder ' ' of swaying ropes. // Once again , our group follows and comes out victorious . And as each person disengages himself from the spider ' s web , those watching on the ground applaud . When we break up for lunch , we all feel elated. // ' ' There ' s a lot of fear on the part of people that they can ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' s owner , Jim Boulding . But fear , and particularly embarrassment , shouldn ' t hold people back , he says . ' ' Everybody ' s on a different level . We ' ve been able to understand that everybody ' s always on a different level. ' ' // Mr. Boulding and his wife , Myrna , have owned Strathcona Park Lodge , in Strathcona Provincial Park in the center of Vancouver Island , for 27 years . Mrs. Boulding ' s father once owned the land now covered by Strathcona ' s man-made lake , and the government gave him the lakefront property in trade. // The Bouldings , both former teachers , describe their resort as an ' ' outdoor wilderness education center . ' ' It combines facilities for tourists , a school for training teen-agers in outdoor skills , and a summer camp for younger kids. // All these facilities interact . Once the teen-agers pass the Wilderness Leadership course , they ' re ready to teach the kids and the tourists a wide variety of sports. // What makes the variety possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We are extremely lucky that we have the physiography of the mountains , lakes , rivers , and ocean right close together , ' ' says Mr. Boulding . In winter ' ' we have enough snowfall that we can be skiing the same day we are kayaking , canoeing , and fishing . One day you can be in a deep river canyon in a forest and the next day in the alpine tundra. ' ' // Jim Boulding , a big man who is never without his signature floppy leather hat , is someone Hemingway would have admired : an athlete and woodsman whose specialty is outdoor survival skills . This became an interest when ' ' we realized that we were living in this vast country without being sensitive to it , ' ' he says. // Strathcona offers a course in wilderness survival as well as sailing , hiking , and mountaineering . Occasionally subjects like potterymaking , quilting , fly fishing , log cabin construction , and identification of native plants are also covered. // The west coast of Vancouver Island is almost unpopulated , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' ' It ' s open ocean , and you have to know what you ' re doing , ' ' Mr. Boulding says . An understanding of the history of the area is also required of Strathcona ' s guides . ' ' It ' s just stupid to paddle along the coast and not understand the Indian culture , ' ' he says. // Because of the various aspects to Strathcona , ' ' we can take different members of the family in different directions , Myrna Boulding points out . ' ' We have a lot of single parents - divorced fathers with their kids , women who can ' t take the kids camping on their own . ' ' She adds , ' ' Most resorts don ' t want families ; we welcome families. ' ' // During my stay , I have even met a very feminine grandmother who brought her grandchildren to Strathcona . They have joined the campers for the week , while she spends most of her time out on a balcony reading and gazing out on the wild Strathcona @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to put visiting children with the campers ) , but in summer we can . If nothing else , I send them off with the baby sitter I have for my own kids . My kids do things all day long , ' ' Mrs. Boulding says. // ' ' We tend to get more women than men ; men tend to think they ' re already experts and don ' t need lessons - though that ' s changing , ' ' she says with a smile . ' ' A father will take a canoeing lesson just to make sure that his // strokes are right . Five years ago that wouldn ' t have happened. ' ' // An Outward Bound mentality does not prevail at Strathcona . For instance , the rock-climbing course provides an opportunity to do rather intimidating things and be quite protected at the same time. // ' ' We ' re pretty safety-conscious here , ' ' Mrs. Boulding says . ' ' We don ' t pit people against the environment . Some programs take people out into white water before they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ re more gradual than that . . . . At the same time we believe that kids can do a lot more than people think they can . We put them through rigorous programs . ' ' That goes for the adults , too. // The nice thing about Strathcona is that it combines the active outdoor life with plenty of indoor comfort . The wooden cabins scattered along the lake have big windows , and the view is handsome ; a cleft in the mountains beyond the lake reveals another , fainter cleft , and several others beyond that . During my stay , a cool mist partly obscured the spiky outlines of the pine trees. // Comfortable beds and good food - whole-grain muffins for breakfast , salmon for dinner - are particularly welcome when you ' re so active. // Flexibility is the key to Strathcona . The Appalachian Mountain Club group found the hiking here too difficult and unrewarding , so the rock-climbing class was arranged for it . Special classes can be arranged for small groups of 4 to 6. // You can do a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the afternoon , the rock-climbing class is introduced to ' ' belaying ' ' - climbing with the help of a safety harness and a rope secured to the top of the cliff . In the evening I had my first kayaking lesson in the enclosed bay convenient to the boathouse and the sauna. // // Practical information // // * You can just rent a room at Strathcona ( $34-42 for a double with lake view , deck , and private bath ) , or camp out ( $8. 75 a day , including bathhouse and sauna privileges ) , or take meals only ( $16 a day ) .
