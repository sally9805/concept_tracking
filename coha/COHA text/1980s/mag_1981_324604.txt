A new report on high schools rubs some educators the wrong way <P> " Scientists will argue for years about this report . " So said Sociologist Robert Grain last week at a Washington meeting of 400 educators and lobbyists , called by the National Center for Education Statistics ( NCES ) to scrutinize " Public and Private Schools , " the latest report issued by University of Chicago Sociologist James S. Coleman . Also under review : " Minority Students in Catholic Secondary Schools , " a study by Coleman 's colleague , Sociologist Andrew Greeley . <P> Coleman has been issuing hotly debated reports since 1966 , when he concluded , after doing a nationwide survey , that black pupils learn better when they go to school with whites , a finding that aided integration . Now he has completed the first part of a federally funded study of U.S. high schools . His conclusion : even after allowing for differences in family background , private schools do a better job than public schools-largely because they maintain better discipline and provide more challenging academic demands . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school educators , who are already concerned about President Reagan 's endorsement of tax credits for private school tuition payments . They listened warily to the conclusions Coleman drew from a survey of 58,728 sophomores and seniors in 1,016 high schools . Public school sophomores appear twice as likely to disobey , fight or commit acts of vandalism in schools . Only a quarter of the public school sophomores said they spent more than five hours a week on homework , in contrast with nearly half in Catholic and other private schools . <P> The finding that hit hardest , though , was Coleman 's comparison of educational achievement , based on test scores . He found that in reading , vocabulary , mathematics , science , civics and writing , the nation 's 1.4 million private pupils notably outperform the 13.5 million public schoolers . Greeley 's study made a similar point : students from minority low-income families do much better academically in Catholic schools than in public schools . <P> Many of the assembled experts challenged the findings , declaring that Coleman had overstated his conclusions . Among the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that sponsored the study . Their main point : some of his performance comparisons are invalid because 70% of private school students are college bound and pursue academic programs , compared with about a third of public school pupils ( the rest are in vocational and commercial courses ) . <P> In response to NCES criticism , Coleman re-analyzed his data and agreed that pre-collegiate public school seniors , for example , do at least as well on tests as Catholic school seniors . While public and private college-bound programs may yield comparable results , Coleman insists that the school systems on the whole are not equal , if only because public schools channel so many students into nonacademic programs . In that practice and others , public schools can profit by private school experience . Said Columbia University Education Professor Diane Ravitch : " Coleman suggests a model in which the climate of learning is conditioned by good behavior and effective discipline . There are powerful lessons to be learned by public educators from these papers . "             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
