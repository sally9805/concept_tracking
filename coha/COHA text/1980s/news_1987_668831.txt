Former Chicago Police Supt. Richard Brzeczek was acquitted of theft charges Thursday and immediately launched into a tirade over what he called " a conspiracy to come after me " by his onetime political opponent , Cook County State ' s Atty . Richard M. Daley . Brzeczek said that the charges should never have been brought against him and that Daley was a " fraud " who " set out to destroy me politically , personally and professionally . " Brzeczek ' s comments came moments after Cook County Criminal Court Judge Robert Boharic acquitted him of 24 counts of theft and official misconduct . The judge found that police department records were kept by " bureaucratic forgers " and were not accurate enough to prove prosecution charges that Brzeczek stole $1 , 231 to take trips with his former girlfriend . Brzeczek hugged and kissed his wife , Elizabeth , then went downstairs to face reporters and began a 15-minute speech against Daley , some of his former police colleagues and the ex-girlfriend . " Richard Daley will some day have to face a judge , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ don ' t know , if it ' s going to be on this planet or sometime in the after-life . Richard Daley has to spend the rest of his life looking in the mirror when he shaves in the morning to determine what he did . " Richard Daley is a fraud . He ' s trying to take advantage of a dead man ' s name , a man who ' s been dead almost 11 years , and Daley can not stand on his own two feet . " Michael Angarola , Daley ' s first assistant , went to Daley ' s defense , telling reporters that he , not Daley , made the decision to press the charges against Brzeczek , who ran unsuccessfully for state ' s attorney against Daley in 1984 . " Nobody was out to get him , " Angarola said . He said that his office has charged police officers with taking $10 or $20 bribes and that he approved the charges against Brzeczek because he didn ' t want a " double standard " to exist in his office . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said . " I can understand how he would lash out in a tirade . I don ' t think there ' s any need for any member of this office to respond to that kind of tirade . " Prosecutors charged that Brzeczek , 44 , stole police department money to take a trip to San Diego and two trips to Minneapolis during 1982 to meet flight attendant Sonja Butterfield , 47 . Financial vouchers indicated that the superintendent was attending business meetings in those cities , according to the prosecutors . But those meetings never took place , witnesses said , and Butterfield testified that Brzeczek rarely left her side during the trips . Judge Boharic , however , said Brzeczek may have falsely filled out the vouchers and later paid the city back  --  so that his wife wouldn ' t know the true nature of his trips . " They proved he was cheating on his wife , " the judge said . " They absolutely proved that . " But he said that Brzeczek was a " dedicated " superintendent and that some testimony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and unreliable . One clerk admitted that she altered records to make the books balance . In closing arguments Wednesday , Assistant State ' s Atty . Jack Quirk said that the vouchers " tell a very interesting story " and prove that Brzeczek stole city money . " I think you ' ll find , as we say in the profession , here the documents speak for themselves , " he said . But defense lawyer George Murtaugh Jr. told the judge that the state ' s case involved only " innuendo , speculation , surmise and conjecture . . . the tools of the economist , the weatherman and those columns that address themselves to gossip . " " Innuendo ? " responded co-prosecutor Randy Johnston . " The state doesn ' t deal in innuendo . . . . We deal in facts . " The evidence is abundantly clear that the defendant , in order that he could carry on his personal assignations , lied to the police department about why travel checks should be issued.
