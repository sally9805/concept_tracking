txt  | about one hour and 35 minutes to get his packages lined up so he can coordinate his route plan . Another courier yells at Beckman : " Hey , Phil . . . with that visitor with you this morning , are you going for Vic Babel 's record today ? That 'll really impress the professor from Memphis . He 'll tell Fred Smith about you . " Phil nods calmly and says : " We 'll see . " Vic Babel 's name is on the wall , indicating he holds the station record to date for the most stops and on-time deliveries . Petro , a thick shouldered courier cuts in : " Babel was lucky . All the stops were close and there was n't much traffic . " " Babel won it fair and square . You guys are all goof-offs , " the other replied . On the same wall is the vehicle accident record to remind the couriers to be careful . " If you have an accident and it 's your fault , a report goes into your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us make around $30,000 a year with overtime , and you sure do n't want to be sacked because of careless accidents . " Promptly at 8:20 a.m . Beckman and I pull out of the garage to start his deliveries . The first stop is under the elevated transit structure on Wabash . Phil pulls out a package , locks the van , and runs into a street level office . He makes a few more stops as he works his way toward the Palmer House Hotel . After a stop near the hotel , he drives to 231 South LaSalle Street to get his van as close as possible to the Continental Illinois Bank because he has a big load of Courier Pak envelopes and Overnight Letters for the bank . The Courier Paks are 12 inch by 151 inch envelopes with an enclosed maximum permissible weight of up to 2 pounds per item . The Overnight Letter product is a 63/8 inch by 11 inch envelope with a maximum permissible weight of 2 ounces . As we hurry , Phil talks , " The Continental Illinois Bank is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I sure try to take very good care of them . Here I got ta use the freight elevator down that alley over there . If I had only a few packages , I could go through the lobby but with this hand cart there 's no way they 're going to let us go on the passenger elevator . " This time it is a challenge for us to get into the building . We reach Continental 's freight elevator by first descending a crude sidewalk-tobasement lift , obviously a relic of an earlier building , then negotiate several turns in a cavernous and dirty basement filled with trash cans and scattered debris , to reach one of the internal freight elevators . It takes nearly ten minutes to reach the bank 's upper floor mail room . While we 're waiting for the elevator , Phil does some paperwork . Once we reach our destination several security guards say hello . Phil is a regular here each business day , and he has good rapport with the bank personnel . The bank stop consumes about 30 minutes . Phil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of the  | Courier Paks and Overnight Letters he has brought into the building . Once out of the bank , Phil does not have to move his truck to make the next several deliveries . He is fortunate today to have found a good parking spot along the curb . " This does n't happen too often , " he observes . " It must be my lucky day . " Phil explains , " Downtown Chicago is a vertical market . The bulk of my deliveries are in high-rise office buildings or in factory lofts where movement is up and down by elevators . Those guys out in the suburbs operate in a horizontal market . Their deliveries and pickups are usually in single-story office buildings or office-warehouses stretched out for miles . Geez , those guys drive a lot of miles covering their routes . " Obviously impressed with Federal 's planning , Phil continues his lecture : " The company has really worked on the problem of increasing the efficiency of our pickup and delivery system . As business has grown , our stops are closer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 're not like United Parcel Service . Those guys are tightly engineered in the way they handle their pickups and deliveries . Each of their stops is timed . Per package handled , UPS is really cost-conscious . Federal Express , on the other hand , is not nearly so tightly engineered . That 's because we 're more price/value-oriented . " I was struck by his comparisons , so I ventured to ask if there were other differences . Phil says , " Sure there are . Both UPS and the U. S. Postal Service guys do n't give the customer as much attention as we do . Federal Express customers expect more because they feel they are paying for this service . We 're the only outfit that traces a package every inch of the way from the time it is picked up until it is delivered . That 's just one example . " His comrades in the garage were right : Phil was a real competitor . So I asked him if he thought he were brain-washed by Federal 's hype . " No , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We have been an innovator in improving service levels in the small package express business . Most of our competitors , like Emery , Airborne , and the others , try to copy everything we do . All of the people at the station think they are working for the best company . They 'll tell you that . " Phil continues his deliveries in and around the Financial District . At 10:10 a.m. he is down to his last few packages . " I 'll make it by 10:30 a.m. easily , " he remarks . " That new 10:30 a.m. delivery cutoff point is sacred with us . That 's what we promise the customer . That 's why we get the business and can charge more . " By 10:45 a.m . Phil Beckman is back at the station , as are most of the morning couriers . All of them are working on their paperwork , and getting ready to go out on the streets again to deliver the packages sent by the shippers using Federal Express ' Standard Air Service . This is a service for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Priority 1 , Courier-Pak , and Overnight Letter services , because it commits to a two-day service , and not the " next morning by  | 10:30 a.m. " service for the three higher-priced products . The couriers are also assigned to deliver what the company calls " starter kits " to new customers so they can begin using Federal Express ' services . Once these particular deliveries are completed , and Phil and the other couriers are back at the station finishing their paperwork , the Federal Express Package Cycle is almost complete . They will clean out their delivery vans , then go into the small lounge for a cup of coffee or a candy bar from vending machines before checking out to go home . Soon the afternoon crew will report in , and the cycle begins all over again . It had been a tiring 24 hours as I had pursued this particular 24-hour cycle beginning and ending at the station in downtown Chicago . I was impressed by the technical performance Federal 's fleet of trucks and planes exhibited but , more to the point , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It would have given Fred Smith absolute confidence that his admonition to " treat each package as if it were the last package Federal Express will ever handle " was being respected by his employees . " We do pretty good , " says supervisor Carol Jeselski . " Except when we have a winter snowstorm in Chicago , we meet our service commitments to customers about 99 percent of the time . That 's a far cry from the Post Office and the other package outfits . " There is , however , more to this Venture Capital story than technology and employees .  | " If Fred Smith lined up all 13,000 Federal Express employees on the Hernando de Soto Bridge in Memphis and said , Jump ! ' 99.9 percent of them would leap into the swift Mississippi River below . That 's how much faith they 've got in this guy , " says Heinz Adam who is in charge of Customer Service . " You 've seen that poster , The Marines are looking for a few good men , ' where the troops are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " says Art Bass , who served as Federal 's president from 1975 to 1980 . Bass goes on to add , " This company should have died five or six times in its first three or four years , but Fred refused to give up . Boy , was he tenacious . With sheer bull and courage he pulled off a miracle . That 's the only way to express what he did . " This same opinion , although phrased in somewhat different words , was expressed by dozens of Smith 's employees , from senior officers down through the ranks of the veteran couriers . Fred Smith had suddenly emerged as one of the new glamour symbols of the entrepreneurial business world . What he had accomplished was considered brash , daring , and highly creative . Barron 's , Business Week , Dun 's , Esquire , Financial World , Forbes , Fortune , and Nation 's Business all featured articles on Fred Smith and Federal Express . Smith was watched closely by the authoritative publication , Aviation Week and Space Technology , and most of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newsworthy . The Washing- ton Post and several other major metropolitan newspapers ran featured stories on Smith in their Sunday supplement sections . Television could not overlook Smith either . Segments on " Fred Smith and his Federal Express " appeared on NBC 's " Prime Time Saturday , " and on Bill Moyers ' " Creativity " series developed for public television . Smith became the centerpoint of the public 's attention to this flashy company for which its dramatic color scheme of purple , orange and white planes and trucks serve as a moving billboard . Moreover , its sometimes provocative and always entertaining television commercials all helped create an enormous corporate identity practically overnight . He still receives the credit for the company 's success despite the huge contributions of a loyal and talented group of senior officers and managers , as well as the dedicated rank-andfile employees . And , to be fair , he admits that . His people stood in admiration of him . They willingly accepted a secondary role when the publicity started flooding the media about Fred Smith and his Federal Express . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself to gain more visibility for his key associates . " Art Bass and Roger Frock , two guys who were with Fred from the start , really never got the credit they deserved from the various media and the financial community for what they did to build this company , " says Charles Lea who was heavily involved in the company 's startup . " Some of these guys around Smith also had strong personalities and egos like Fred 's , but they seemed willing to play subordinate roles and stay out of the limelight . I guess they rationalized it away . After all , he made several of them millionaires . " The emergence of Fred Smith , of his company , of the corporate culture which Smith has created should suggest a series of questions which need answers . Who is Fred Smith ? What kind of background created his drive ? Is this successful Southerner a one-of-a-kind entrepreneur who has emerged from a region of the country not generally known as a spawning ground for founders of large nationwide corporations ? Or is he simply a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really the forerunner of a new generation of company ? Or is it the same old " Dark Satanic Mill " William Blake identified at the beginning of the Industrial Revolution , albeit now dressed in high-tech finery ? Who is this dynamic young business leader who conceptualizes his company as an heir to military strategist Von Clauswitz and the Marine Corps ? Is he the prototype for a new generation of American business man ? Or is he the rich kid , born to the purple , as the saying goes , managing an electronic plantation where cotton ? now transformed into Courier-Paks , Priority 1 packages , and Overnight Letters ? is still king ? On August 11th , during the summer , 1944 , Frederick Smith , then  | 49 , and his 23-year-old fourth wife , Sally Wallace Smith , were visiting one of their Northern Mississippi farms when their son , Frederick Wallace Smith , was born in nearby Marks , Mississippi . The elder Smith had achieved considerable success as a businessman . He was founder and chairman of Dixie Greyhound Bus Lines , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The bus company Fred 's father had built from pluck and determination was one of the largest bus lines in the South until it was purchased by Greyhound Bus Lines . Not only had he personally built his first bus by using the body of a truck , but he was also its first driver until he started adding new routes . As his father had been a steamboat captain plying the Mississippi and Ohio rivers , the elder Smith was the second generation in the transportation business . Little did he know that his new born son would extend this transportation dynasty into a third generation . The elder Smith had an uncanny ability to recognize a business opportunity . In 1934 , at the depth of the Depression , he put venture capital into a small , struggling quick-service restaurant chain specializing in hamburgers , chili and pies . Called the Toddle House ? because the pre-assembled buildings tended to toddle somewhat as they were hauled to the site ? Smith quickly built a national chain of these units . When the Toddle House company was sold in 1961 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ received stock reported to be worth $22 million . Once he had achieved success in the Depression-wracked 1930s , Smith became an active sportsman , buying surplus U. S. naval vessels and renovating them into pleasure boats . He was an outgoing , flamboyant individual ; he was a southern son of Horatio Alger . Failure in life was impossible for him ; it simply was not one of the options he allowed himself . During the Great Depression he said , " Many a man is struggling along on a small salary a week because he does n't realize he can earn ten times as much . " At that time a Memphis newspaper editorialized in admiration of the elder Smith , " The reputation of this man is that of a hard hitting , determined executive , who knows what he wants and is willing to pay the price ? no matter how big . " Despite his gregarious nature , the elder Smith was somewhat of a loner . After his financial success he never found his way into the closely knit , xenophobic Memphis social structure . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mid-nineteenth century did not accept him , and he did not seem to care ? at least externally . His reaction to these backward looking , wealthy and socially established families was clear ; he despised them . Smith despised anyone with money who would not put it to work , and who would not sustain charitable and cultural causes . Just prior to his death in 1948 , at the age of 53 , the elder Smith wrote a letter to his young son to be opened on his twenty-first birthday . The long letter  | concluded with a request that young Fred put his inheritance to work and use the funds held in trust as a foundation for greater wealth . " My father did n't want me to be a fop , " explained the younger Smith years later when he was being questioned at a Chancery Court hearing in Memphis by an attorney representing the financial interests of his half-sisters , Fredette and Laura . After his father 's early death , young Fred was raised by his mother in Memphis . Although he was born @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called Calve-Perthes disease ? she encouraged him to enter into all sorts of physical activities . Throughout grammar school he wore braces and used crutches , but nothing really slowed him down . According to his mother he was an extraordinarily active child . Perhaps the first index of his future prowess as a leader came when his teachers recognized his organizational skills . When they wanted something done right , Fred got the assignment . Fred was a friendly youngster and an excellent student . Like many small boys in the South , Fred became very interested in military history , especially in the history of the Civil War . As a small boy toting crutches under his arms , a holstered gun on his hip , he went to a National Guard summer camp . But for a small boy surrounded by that " damned yankee " attitude so thick in Memphis during the last days of Boss Crump and in the flurry of desegregation orders , there was only one real war , the Civil War . He and his mother often visited the Shiloh battlefield on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toy soldiers with which he exercised his ripening imagination by re-enacting the pitched battles he had read about . His mother encouraged his interest in the military because of the strong military tradition in the family . Following grammar school , young Fred enrolled in Memphis University School , a fine privately financed preparatory school with a good reputation for offering its students a solid academic training . As he matured his Calve-Perthes disease was cured , so that he was able to distinguish himself not only in academic work , and as a student leader , but also as an athlete . Where before he had lumbered around on crutches , at prep school he played both basketball and football . In his senior year , Fred was voted " Best All-Around Student . " During this period two watershed things happened : at the age of 15 Smith learned to fly and that same year he and two of his tenthgrade classmates organized a business , the Ardent Record Company ? a company still flourishing in Memphis today . They set up a fully equipped studio in a garage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talent from Memphis and the surrounding region . Their first release on the Ardent label , " Rock-House " and on the flip side , " Big Satin Mama , " broke even . Young Smith withdrew from his first entrepreneurial venture when he entered Yale in the fall , 1962 , but he carried with him the lessons learned there and , of course , continued his enthusiasm for flying .  | His first two years at Yale were a sobering educational experience for Smith . At prep school he had been a high-ranking student academically and a class leader . But at Yale he found the competition much more difficult . He held only a B minus average during these years while majoring in economics and political science . Smith was later to confess , " I was a crummy student . " The Yale student body was captivated at that time by President Kennedy 's " New Frontier " program . It was a heady time to be a college student . Kennedy and his advisors had articulated a set of challenges for the 1960s which boldly focused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face the challenging times and revolutionary technologies coming . It was a period replete with a new breed of heroes , too , as astronauts , Alan Shepard and John Glenn seemed to provide new role models for Kennedy 's call to a new frontier . But Fred Smith was not caught up in any momentous cause of the day . He studied economics with a top rate faculty who had survived a devastating case made against them by William F. Buckley ten years earlier in his book , God and Man at Yale . Buckley had accused Yale of harboring a faculty " agnostic as to religion , Keynesian as to economics , and collectivist as applied to the relation of the individual to society and government . " Although he lived in a heady atmosphere , Smith seemed unaffected . He was a fraternity man , a campus disk jockey , and with the help of two professors , organized the Yale Flying Club . In so doing they revitalized this long defunct club which had been originally organized after World War I by no less than Juan Trippe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Airways . All of this campus activity got Smith elected into Skull and Bones , the prestigious senior secret honorary society organized at Yale in 1832 . He may not have been a card carrying New Frontiersman ; he was not equipped with all the fashionable theories and postures ; but he was in another way following pioneers like Trippe . And he was a certified " Big Man On Campus . " Student radicalism started slowly at Yale , beginning mildly in 1964 , and reaching the proverbial " fever pitch " in 1969 and 1970 . Consequently , Fred Smith had graduated in May , 1966 , and was in Vietnam when the student activist movement picked up velocity on the Yale campus . Seemingly , he was carrying no deep convictions about any domestic social causes . He was not angry about anything . He had enrolled in the U. S. Marine Corps platoon leaders program while still an undergraduate , so he knew military service was awaiting his graduation from Yale . As a result , at graduation , he was commissioned a second lieutenant , Marine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 21 , Smith was now ready to experience the reality of war . He was going to have the opportunity to know it from an angle different than that found in books , different even from that to be found in dioramas of lead soldiers , and so utterly different than those shards  | of war left in museums , or those monuments standing alone in fields where the battle had once been . At 21 he was assigned to the First Marine Division , Fleet Marine Force in South Vietnam , after finishing a program at the Defense Language Institute , Monterey , California . At 21 , the man left behind the boy . When asked later why he had joined the Marines , Smith replied : " I had a typical Southerner 's viewpoint of the military . I knew I had to go . " Smith recalled his military experience during his first of two tours of duty in Vietnam observing : " I joined the First Marine Division and went to the Third Battalion , Fifth Regiment , where I was assigned as a platoon leader @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a platoon leader for approximately six months and after a brief three-week stint on the battalion staff , I was assigned as a company commander and put in command of K Company , Third Battalion , Fifth Regiment . The previous commander of K company was killed in action shortly before I took over . I participated in 27 named operations , either amphibious or ground launch . " His first tour of duty in Vietnam lasted seven months . He returned to Memphis on leave before beginning a second tour . In October , 1968 , when asked by a reporter for the Memphis Commercial Appeal why he was going back for a second time , Smith told him , " It 's not that I 'm more patriotic than anyone else , but there are 500,000 Americans over there now and there is a job I 've been asked to do . I 'm not being conceited , but I have had a year 's experience and I know I can do it better than any new officer they might send in to replace me . " Smith won @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assigned to fly A4D Skyhawks and OV-10 Broncos as a forward air controller and spotter . He flew reconnaissance missions in the I Corps area just south of the DMZ in Quang Tri Province , scene of some of the heaviest and most costly fighting of the war . He could not have found more action anywhere else in Vietnam . When he was discharged on July 21 , 1969 , he had attained the rank of Captain and been awarded the Silver Star , Bronze Star , two Purple Hearts , the Navy Commendation Medal , and the Vietnamese Cross of Gallantry . Vietnam had been an awakening for Fred Smith . If in Memphis and New Haven he had associated with the youth of privilege and wealth , in Vietnam he led less privileged men , watched their courage , shared their agony . He credits a black platoon sargeant ? a veteran of 14 years in the Marines ? for helping him to understand what enlisted men think and want . Reminiscing about Vietnam , he credits the lessons he learned from this sargeant with enabling him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He developed compassion for the Vietnamese peasants ; he admired the determination of Ho Chi Minh . He learned to honor the ancient landscape and its cradled culture which were being savaged and brutalized by military confrontation . Trying to describe that  | bizarre quality of Vietnam and demonstrating his flair for phrase making he recalled of the war that there " the real was the unreal .. . the unreal was the real . There was an incomprehensible aspect to it all , like a bad but fascinating dream . " At Yale he had not known what he would do after the Marine Corps ; he had even considered attending law school or graduate school . Byron Hogue , Smith 's personal aide at Federal Express , knew him in Vietnam . Hogue maintains that the legacy Vietnam gave Smith was an essential toughness which sustained him and the company throughout the serial crises Smith confronted from 1973 through 1977 . Fred Smith once expressed something of that legacy when he observed after suffering a major setback while trying to arrange financing for Federal Express , " It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like getting killed or maimed in Vietnam . " It 's a kind of perspective that can not be gained from a Business School MBA ! But perspective was not the only legacy of the Vietnam War . In Hawaii , on his way home , Smith married his high school sweetheart . A month later at 25 , in August , 1969 , he began to put his inheritance to work , by purchasing controlling interest in a Little Rock company called Arkansas Aviation Sales . His stepfather , a retired Air Force General , had taken over the company , a fixed base operator which provided maintenance services for turbo-prop and corporate jet aircraft , in 1967 . Fred Smith had kept posted on the operations of the company while in Vietnam , so he knew the company was losing money . Once back in Little Rock , Smith took control and changed it into an aggressive business buying and selling used corporate jets . Smith was an unusual figure in this very competitive business . Whereas the typical airplane broker was usually thin on cash and had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own money to buy many of the planes . Financial success was quick to his new Arkansas Aviation Sales . And Smith himself made a lot of money dealing in corporate jets . But he observed : " I really did n't like this business . It was full of shady characters . I just did n't feel comfortable dealing with a lot of these people . " Little Rock is a small , quiet and conservative city in central Arkansas . It is a community where religion is big business , where it is as common for prominent businessmen to quote the Bible in their dealings as often as they quote the stock market . He had established a good credit relationship with the local banks while he was building up profits at Arkansas Aviation Sales and his real estate portfolio . They knew Smith was independently wealthy and that he had inherited a sizeable fortune from his father . Some wanted him as a board member of their institutions . In him they saw a financial golden boy , bright , handsome , wealthy , self-confident , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that record was less than 36 months old . The Little Rockers smelled money ; he was someone they felt they , could make money with as  | Fred Smith was piecing together the structure which would become Federal Express . The maturity , the financial backing , the corporation . The missing element still unexamined is the financial legacy . The inheritance , except for the funds he acquired at age 21 , was held in a family trust called Frederick Smith Enterprise Company , Inc. , for which the National Bank of Commerce in Memphis acted as trustee . His late father had formed this vehicle in the early 1940 's to hold certain properties , which under the elder Smith 's will , would pass into certain trusts for the benefit of his three children , Fred , Fredette and Laura . The Enterprise Company was merely a corporation which owned securities of other corporations , and certain real estate located in Memphis . Its principal assets were 164,800 shares of Squibb-Beechnut preferred convertible stock , stock whose value was estimated to be $13.3 million in 1971 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Both Fredette and Laura had slightly smaller shares . In 1965 , when Smith was 21 , he had gone on the board of directors of Enterprise . Enterprise was then , as it had been since the elder Smith 's death in 1948 , a passive trust . The bank trustees neither bought nor sold any of the trust 's assets . Fortunately , the SquibbBeechnut stock ? the primary asset ? proved to be a good investment . When Fred Smith returned from Vietnam , he began offering new ideas to the board members , urging them to take a more active stance in its investment policies . Initially , his efforts did little to deploy Enterprise 's assets more imaginatively and aggressively . Fredette and Laura did not like the bank 's long time trust officer because they felt he had been too protective of the assets . They wanted to realize more income from the annual distribution of dividends . In 1971 , the Enterprise Company 's investment strategy changed ; Fred Smith became board president . He believed he had the support of Fredette and Laura @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aggressive operating company . And he had very good reason to feel he was undertaking to follow his father 's wishes as well . Consequently , when Fred and his business advisors came to Enterprise board meetings quite excited about an idea to start a special type of air cargo airline , Fredette and Laura willingly gave their assent to explore this venture by authorizing a modest sum of Enterprise 's funds to be used as seed capital . The fact that Fred Smith was willing to match the Enterprise investment with his own personal funds was as well-received then as it would be later . The financial base seemed within reach and Smith was ready to move .  | " I just knew it was correct , but there were only a few believers at first , " reflects Fred Smith . " The overwhelming body of opinion said it would n't work , or that we could n't raise the money . " The idea for Federal Express did not emerge fully battle clad from the head of Plutus ? the blind Greek god of wealth ? though it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yale undergraduate in 1965 , he wrote one of those student exercises in futility and haste , an artificial crisis theoretically designed to induce thought , a term-paper . In it he shaped crudely an idea from which the purple , orange and white elegance we know as Federal Express emerged . Looking back on it from the surety of success , he confessed : " It was just a term paper . You know how it is in your undergraduate days . You leave everything to the last minute . That 's the way this paper was written . But I sure had the right idea in pointing out that the air freight industry 's future was by no means assured . The passenger route systems used by most air freight shippers were totally wrong for freight distribution . The costs would not come down with volume . It was a technical , an economic impossibility . Air freight would only work in a system designed specifically for it , not as a simple addon to passenger service . " His Yale professor was not impressed . A gilt-edged concept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ C " for his inspiration . His professor 's main criticism of Smith 's idea was that it did not have a chance because of the  | heavy regulation of air transportation by the Civil Aeronautics Board and intense competition . He was right about the heavy regulation . Federal Express ' package volume growth was almost capped in 1975 and 1976 when the Civil Aeronautics Board refused to allow the company to fly larger and more efficient aircraft . The regulatory laws , backed up by a hostile commercial airline industry , were there to block Smith 's " irrefutable logic " from being proven outright . And to be fair to this Yale red-pen-wielder , Smith 's late-nightwonder did not spell out any details of a grand design for a specific type of airline network with technical and administrative support systems . The general theme of the paper was that there was a huge market out there in the economy for an efficient service for moving high priority , time-sensitive small shipments like medicines , computer parts , and electronics . The American public was not being well served @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ packages were " hippety-hopping around the country from city to city and from airline to airline before reaching their destination . " And he observed that there was no control over the packages by the originating air carrier if the packages had to be carried by additional airlines before reaching their ultimate destination . That Smith 's concept found voice so early , survived initial humiliation , and persisted through two tours of duty in Vietnam is frankly amazing . It would be impossible to write the history of the early days of the air freight business because no one really knows when the first box or package was transported by an airplane for delivery to what the business designates as a " consignee . " The Post Office began regular mail service between New York and Washington in 1918 , but it did not handle larger parcels . Juan Trippe , founder of Pan American , had mail contracts in the early 1920s along the East Coast . As early as 1925 Ford Motor Company was flying freight between its plants and , for a time , Ford had seriously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that same time , the Railway Express Agency started an air express service . By 1925 at least four firms were operating air package services . The air freight industry was a dull and unpromising business until the 1960s when commercial airlines jumped into the competition in an all-out effort to attract business from the nation 's industrial firms . During that period in the late 1960s when Smith was in Vietnam , the air cargo picture began to worsen for the commercial airlines . They struggled to make a profit . The huge jet aircraft brought on-line to compete for both passenger and cargo business simultaneously looked like the perfect answer to their problems . They were convinced that putting cargo in the extensive belly space below the passenger deck could be a lucrative profit center . Delta , Eastern , United , and others continued their all-cargo service during the remainder of that decade despite questions about the profitability of such service . The  | commercial airlines had $400 million invested in their all-cargo services , and in addition they had huge capacities in their fuselages for freight . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million in its air cargo business in 1970 . Eastern and American were also losing heavily . Most of the carriers lost money continuously from 1961 through 1973 and largely abandoned their all-cargo carriers . The large jumbo jets purchased to compete in the passenger market did not contribute much revenue from hauling freight in their underbellies . The cubic capacity in the bellies of the 747s , the L-1011s , and the DC-10s was so adequate that management of these airlines felt this was an efficient replacement for the space foregone by the abandonment of the all-cargo planes . Deep down , management was discounting freight and treating it as a by-product or appendage . These wide-bodied jets were designed first and foremost to serve passengers . Ironically , the enormous increase in size the jumbos represented had exactly the opposite effect management sought . They made freight handling more difficult , not less . Most airlines finally discouraged the small package business in the early 1970s . They were not equipped to handle small packages . In fact , small packages were a headache ; they were an unprofitable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What the airlines thought they wanted was freight weighing over 100 pounds , so they left the responsibility for handling small items to Emery and all of the other freight forwarders . " Let them worry about that part of the market , " concluded the airlines ' management . " Besides , " they rationalized , " the forwarders are our largest customers , contributing 40 cents out of every dollar of our freight revenue . " The airlines had their troubles in the early 1970s , and the small package problem was not a particularly urgent one with most of them . Hundreds of flights were canceled . Service as it had been known in the 1960s had changed for a number of compelling reasons . First , the huge wide-bodied jets increased seating capacities so that flights were consolidated to increase economic efficiency . And additionally , many night flights , or off-peak-hour flights , were cut back to save money . Then the Arab oil embargo , and rising fuel costs , put a real scare in airlines insofar as their expense structures were concerned . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began allocating fuel to airlines in order to protect domestic supplies . This decline of off-peak-hour service hit the air freight forwarders hard . Old veterans in that industry were fond of saying , " Air freight is basically a night animal ; passengers are day animals . " Most air freight items were picked up from shippers in the late afternoon or early evening and taken to the airport for flights leaving after 10:00 p.m. for overnight delivery to the consignee . Freight forwarders could not use much of the belly space in 747s or DC-10s leaving  | O'Hare Airport in Chicago at 5:00 p.m. , or Los Angeles International Airport at 6:15 p.m . In the early 1970 's , service was also cut to many of the smaller regional cities , like Chattanooga and Reno . Some small cities lost half or more of their scheduled flights as airlines made decisions to concentrate their attention on the major metropolitan air transportation hubs . This was the state of the freight forwarding industry when Fred Smith took over Arkansas Aviation Sales . With the elimination of passenger service by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and other air freight delivered within a day or two after being picked up was escalated . Smith 's Arkansas Aviation Sales was one of the victims of this deteriorating air service . It was causing him problems in operating his firm ; so he decided to become an activist to do something about this inefficient distribution system . Smith reflects , " I became infuriated that I could not receive on any timely and reliable basis air freight shipments from places around the United States . Sometimes it might be two days , and sometimes , five days , before you could get a part delivered in Little Rock . It was unpredictable . " From that point on he stepped up his research to find a way to close what he called the most classical gap in the transportation system . He considered what he was experiencing as a perfect example of the American high-tech industrial base not being able to find solutions to the most obvious economic problems . This is certainly one of the reasons Federal Express ' cargo sales force received such a good response from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fast , reliable air freight system to replace the erratic ones they were used to since the late 1960s . The small package express market had been growing rapidly measured on an annual percentage basis . Still , in 1970 not many had really given much thought to the market potential for items that could be classified as high value , time-sensitive packages or documents requiring priority service . The growth of this segment was hidden deep in the national freight volume figures representing small shipments moving between the various cities in the United States . Conceptually , Smith had identified an opportunity . The great unknown to him was how he would work out the mechanics of implementing his idea . Since he was both optimistic and naive , there was no chance that he was going to worry himself to death over a lot of details . Over all , he thought of himself as an idea man , not a detail man . He seemed to believe things would work out .  | Federal Express faced a big challenge at the start . How was it going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was also what the initial venture capitalists and the lenders wondered . Once the reliability of the service could be established with customers , Smith and his close associates felt the package volume would skyrocket and the profits would flow in rapidly . But little did they realize it was not going to be an easy task . The company had to impress enough prestigious companies at first in order to get the endorsements or referrals needed to add additional customers . It had to convince the 3M company in St. Paul , Minnesota , for example , that a courier could pick up 35 packages and documents at corporate headquarters at 7:00 p.m. , and then have them transported to 35 customers of 3M located in 35 different cities by 6:30 or 7:30 a.m. the next day , and then these same packages delivered by other Federal Express ground couriers to the designated consignees that morning . To make this point in dozens of formal and informal presentations in New York , Chicago , Baltimore , St. Louis , Little Rock , and Memphis before prospective investors and lenders , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air freight industry . He characterized the management of the airlines and the air freight forwarders as slow-witted and unimaginative . " They have been notoriously bad planners , " Smith emphasized to his audiences . " The public 's image of the industry is often one of  | a ragged band of firms wrestling with sacks of potatoes and groceries . They do n't see these outfits as transporters of medicines , vital computer parts , architectural drawings , legal documents and other high value , time-sensitive items , " added Smith . " The public is n't too impressed when they have to deal with an overweight , gruff , shabbily dressed character chomping on a stale cigar in some seedy shed near an airport or on the back of some loading dock . If the opportunities were going to be fully exploited , " continued Smith , " the public 's image had to be changed . " Smith then would broadly outline his plan to turn this image around and to capitalize on what he felt was a huge untapped market in the American business community for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more technical presentations as to the details of the Federal Express operating plan . " He was more articulate in explaining the details of the Federal Express concept , " says Charles L. Lea , Jr. , then executive vice president of New Court Securities . " There were always some detail-oriented bank or investment house technicians in the audiences who had to be satisfied the logistical system proposed by Smith to move the packages would work . " To succeed with the investors , the superconfident Smith had to convince enough of them to back their belief in his plan with funding . They had to be convinced that Smith had indeed found a hole in the market , and that such a company specializing in transporting time-sensitive , critical packages and documents could capture the higher-income-yielding segment of the air express market and make a profit . What Smith had done was , on one hand , to recognize that high-technology processes often need critical parts and supplies on a " must-have " time-sensitive basis , and on the other hand to recognize that for all the electronic information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we were still not ready to dispense with paper . As long as American businessmen wanted to create a time sensitive " paper trail " recording transactions and instructions , there would be a place for a special service such as Federal Express had to offer . Fred Smith defined a time-sensitive item as " one for which the consequences of failure to deliver within a specified period of time would far outweigh any consideration of reasonable rate comparability . If you offer two services and one of them is 15 , 20 , 30 , 40 percent higher on one hand and it gets the documents or items there on time , and a cheaper service whose reliability is not nearly so great , the shipper will always take , if it is time-sensitive , the more reliable method , rather than the cheaper method . This is the essence of the definition of time-sensitive . " The period from 1969 through 1972 was spent in market research . Fred Smith and Joe Golden , one of his Arkansas Aviation Sales employees , investigated the needs of the U. S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Washington researching this  | possible opportunity . Later , in 1972 , as an interim service to generate cash flow for Federal Express , Smith signed contracts with the Postal Service for carrying mail overnight on several routes . The initial idea that excited Smith was the possibility of contracting with the Federal Reserve System and its member district banks to move cash letters within the system on an overnight basis . The logistics of the check clearing process in effect in the early 1970s was cumbersome and inefficient . It often took two or more days to get checks sorted and distributed back through the system to the correct Fed district . This time lapse between , the receipt of checks and the crediting of accounts , Smith calculated , caused a float problem of about $3 million a day . At that time Federal Reserve banks were handling annually almost eight billion checks and non-cash items . Smith tried to sell them on his idea for an efficient overnight check clearing service within the Federal Reserve System . His planes could pick up the cash letters each night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then fly them to a central sorting hub . Then , on an overnight basis , the sorted items would be flown back to the appropriate drop-off point . Smith seemed to think his contacts with Federal Reserve officials had created serious interest in his proposal . He was optimistic about the chances of it being accepted . He did not have the fleet of aircraft at the time , but he believed that equipment could be leased or purchased on short notice if he were awarded a contract . Smith assembled the Enterprise board members on May 28 , 1971 , for the purpose of discussing the status of his contacts with the Federal Reserve . Irby V. Tedder , a retired Air Force colonel and Smith 's vice president and controller of Arkansas Aviation Sales , joined in with the board members to discuss some of the details of the proposed distribution network . The real purpose of that meeting , which Smith presided over as board president , was to request the board members ' endorsement of the Federal Reserve plan and to ask them to agree to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ match this sum with his personal funds . It was a 50-50 arrangement that the board willingly agreed to accept . With this approval , Smith incorporated on June 18 , 1971 , in Delaware , a company he named Federal Express Corporation . The word , " Federal , " was the direct result of Smith 's expectation that he would soon be under contract with the Federal Reserve System hauling cash letters between the various district banks . Later , after the rejection of Smith 's proposal , he felt that the name Federal Express was a particularly good one for creating public attention . There was a patriotic meaning associated with the word , " Federal , " and it also suggested an interest in economic activity nationwide . On June 28 , 1971 , Smith wrote a letter to the other Enterprise  | board members , giving them a detailed explanation of the status of his discussions with the Federal Reserve officials . He concluded , " I feel that our chances of getting this contract are extremely high at this point . I had a conversation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and they are most anxious to receive our proposal . " This letter was written the day before another board meeting of Enterprise to prepare them for his additional request that the members approve a guarantee of a $3.6 million loan from the National Bank of Commerce of Memphis , the same bank serving as trustee . " This loan , " Smith told Enterprise , " was needed to purchase two Dassault Falcon 20 Fan Jets from Pan American World Airways . Pan Am was hesitant to enter into a sales contract without any capitalization or commitment on our part . " Smith persuaded the other board members that negotiations had reached a critical stage with both the Federal Reserve and Pan American . Pan American had agreed to give Smith an exclusive right to other Falcon aircraft at a fixed price Smith considered very attractive . He wanted these planes because they fit into his plan for the nationwide small package airline he intended to launch at a later date . This was his great opportunity , Smith felt , to pull everything together . He sensed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And then , if he could get a five-year contract , that would permit him to acquire the additional Falcons . " This was the scheme , " he explained , " to get the Federal Reserve to provide the credit . " Backing up his arguments further , Smith reassured the Enterprise board that they were taking no risk . He told them that even if the Federal Reserve deal collapsed , he could sell these Falcon jets on the open market for a profit . And this profit would be over-and-above the sum of their investment , the interest on the loan , and the costs of modifying the planes so they could haul cargo . Smith 's half-sisters and the other Enterprise board members gave him their blessing to the loan by resolution . Two weeks later the National Bank of Commerce loan was secured with collateral of 50,000 shares of Squibb-Beechnut stock worth $4 million . The euphoria of midsummer , 1971 , when Fred Smith appeared to be on the verge of launching his airline , collapsed weeks later . The Federal Reserve told Smith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ banks in the Fed system was highly competitive with the others . They could not reach a consensus on Smith 's proposal . Each wanted to arrange for its own transportation network . Federal Express was hardly birthed before it had received its first setback . Reflecting on these events years later , Smith explained to me , " If the Federal Reserve contract had materialized , Federal Express probably would not have become what it is today . But that 's a  | So in the summer , 1971 , Federal Express was still a shell organization which owned two Falcon jets . Smith and Irby Tedder were the whole staff with an occasional assist from Joe Golden . Cash was not yet a problem . Arkansas Aviation Sales , Smith 's principal business endeavor , was doing well financially . Smith refused to abandon his idea , and he did not sell the Dassault Falcons . The French planes were built to carry passengers , so during the fall , 1971 , Smith concerned himself with plans to modify them into cargo planes . More importantly , he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Federal Reserve System . He understood more clearly the concept of the hub-and-spokes system for distributing the future nightly haul of packages and documents . Everything could be picked up from customers in big and small communities alike , flown to a central point , sorted as to flight route and destination city , reloaded on the planes , and then flown in reverse . But he continued refining his plans and contacting an assortment of people on whom to try out his ideas . Some six years had passed since the Yale term paper for which he had been awarded the humiliating " C " grade .  | " What business are we in ? What business should we be in ? " These are questions some corporate executives never answer . They either do not understand the significance of answering these questions , or they do not allow themselves the time to do it . They may assert selfrighteously : " We know what business we are in . That 's what we do ! " Or they may bristle : " What the hell , that 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems to us that is one of those who am I ' riddles so popular with intellectuals . " Fred Smith , assisted by key aides , in the 1972-73 period had pretty well defined the business they wanted to be in and had developed the mechanics needed to operate it . After the rejection of his original air express proposal by the Federal Reserve System in mid-1971 , Smith struggled for several months trying to find his exact niche in the air cargo field . During this period he called on numerous air transportation people to discuss his ideas . A friend in Little Rock introduced Smith to New York investment banker Harmon L. " Buck " Remmell of White , Weld &; Company . Buck Remmell , after listening to Smith discuss his concept , advised , " Do your homework on the front end . Have some independent research done . Try to verify what you think the status of the domestic air freight industry is like . " In December of that year Smith selected the firm of A. T. Kearney , Inc. , a national consulting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ J. Frock , a 10-year  | consulting veteran at A. T. Kearney in New York , was project director of the $75,000 market study which Smith subsequently commissioned . " We began as quickly as Fred wanted us to do , " Frock later remembers , " but not before we had a chance to check with Dun &; Bradstreet about Smith . It was not everyday we signed a large contract with an unknown . Most of our work was with established corporations or the government . We wanted to know Smith 's financial status before we did any work . " And in December , 1971 , Fred Smith also called on At Bass in New York as he had promised he would when they had spoken in Little Rock . " I was really surprised when Fred walked into my office , " explains Bass . " I was now a full-fledged consultant , and no longer selling corporate airplanes . " Art Bass , J. Vincent Fagan and S. Tucker Taylor , all former Pan American Business Jets salesmen , had joined forces to form a small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aerospace Advance Planning Group ? a firm which referred to itself as " AAPG . " AAPG did a variety of things , including marketing research assignments for aircraft firms , publishing aviation directories , and acting as advertising consultants . It was a maverick group composed of highly individualistic , nonconformist partners . Smith felt a special rapport with Bass , Fagan and Taylor , and hired them to duplicate the market study A. T. Kearney had just been hired to do . And it was the same fee , $75,000 . Neither of these consulting groups knew the other was at work on the same assignment . Asked if Fred Smith tried to influence him to come up with a favorable conclusion , Roger Frock told me , " No , he really wanted to know if his concept was practical . " Smith had put up $150,000 to buy this information , although anyone else in Fred Smith 's position might have felt a single study was sufficient . My suspicions are , though I have been unable to prove them , that his financial advisors knew it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both firms began their feasibility studies in late December , 1971 , their assignments were to contact shippers , banks , and brokerage houses , department stores , oil and petrochemical companies and a cross-section of other businesses shipping priority items . They were to explore with the companies their interests in new types of air service and their complaints about existing services . Smith wanted statistical data on the market for priority air freight to take to the Civil Aeronautics Board when he tried to get their authorization to use the Dassault Falcon 20 to haul air freight . AAPG project team headed by Art Bass undertook a huge mail survey of shippers to develop these data . Smith prodded Roger Frock and Art Bass to get their studies done quickly . Additionally he needed preliminary reports from them to take to investment bankers he was contacting . Investment bankers were not going to  | waste their time with Smith unless he could document his case . During early 1972 , Smith commuted frequently between Little Rock and New York , and he often brought along his close aide , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jr . and William N. Carter of Little Rock ; as well as Robert L. Cox , his personal attorney who was also the secretary of Enterprise Company . Together , they would make the rounds visiting White , Weld &; Company , A. T. Kearney and AAPG , Art Bass ' team , for discussions or update reports . Frock , shaking his head in amusement , remembers , " These fellows would come up from Little Rock . Fred often did n't bother to introduce them to me by name , so I did n't know who they were . There was a mystery to it all . And there was this urgency to it all . " The AAPG preliminary report was completed in early March , 1972 , while the A. T. Kearney report was largely completed in May , 1972 , and the final written report was submitted to Smith in early June . Both studies confirmed Smith 's belief that specialized services were desired by shippers of priority air cargo . Both consultants concluded independently that there was a large untapped air freight market in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ billion annual business . Overnight delivery service between airports was not being provided within a network of at least 100 major cities , the consultants told Smith . And , they also told him the demand for this service appeared genuine . Their findings also pointed out that many shippers wanted this type of priority air service to be integrated with the ground or highway legs of the transportation journey between shipper and consignee . Federal Express can compete effectively in the under 50-pound market , Smith was told . He could expect initial capital start-up costs to range from $6.5 million to $15.9 million , and could expect to be generating earnings within six to twelve months after inaugurating the package service . The breakeven point was estimated to be 1.6 million packages and 10,000 tons of charter freight cargo annually . To achieve this breakeven level , Federal Express would only have to tap less than one percent of the total domestic air freight market . In early , 1972 , Smith was planning two profit centers for Federal Express . There would be a scheduled air cargo service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ central hub , then flown to the destination city for delivery to the consignee . " We will provide overnight delivery service , " Smith explained . " We will have 23 planes in service with three backup planes . The first planes will arrive at the central hub at 11:30 p.m. , and the last planes would depart by 3:00 a.m . " Initially , Smith planned to build his central sorting hub at Little Rock 's Adams Field . But Smith also wanted to be in the charter business . During the daylight hours Federal Express would offer an expedited charter service to industries seeking fast same day service between two  | points . Operating these two systems would permit maximum use of the Falcon aircraft fleet Smith was assembling . By late spring , 1972 , Smith , armed with his two feasibility reports , felt he had the concept fairly-well refined . He was ready to try to raise the funds to launch his innovative airline-truck express venture . He was positive he knew what segment of the transportation business he was going into , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that time . Additionally , he concluded he would have to differentiate this service he was proposing from the general hauling of air freight , if he were to attract any interest from investors and customers . One of Fred Smith 's catchy definitions of his business which he used to attract attention was : " We 're a freight service with 550-mile per hour delivery trucks . " Another definition was : " We 're an intermodal transportation system using jet cargo planes . " And later , after the company was established , Smith told the business world that Federal Express was in the " transportation , communication and logistics business . " In defining what he thinks is Federal 's unique role in the daily business economy , Smith has offered this rather visionary observation : " This company is nothing short of being the logistics arm of a whole new society that is building up in our economy ? a society that is n't built around automobile and steel production , but that is built up instead around service industries and high-technology endeavors in electronics and optics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support items that Federal Express is all about . " The general public has continued to think of Federal Express as a very aggressive cargo airline . Early television advertising featured the colorful purple , orange and white Falcon aircraft awaiting the arrival of the company 's trucks and vans with that day 's collection of packages and documents . At first attention was focused primarily on the fleet of airplanes . One early print media ad covered two pages . One page carried , in large bold letters the following statement : " When the airlines are in trouble , we 're bound to be affected . " ? President of Emery Air Freight . Then on the opposite page there was the equally bold print : " That 's exactly why we bought our own planes . " ? President of Federal Express Corporation . Federal 's plan to build this priority small package firm around planes and trucks was greeted skeptically at first . Some of its competitors did not believe one could combine successfully an airline with a trucking company . They claimed they were completely different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Look , " he argued , " a plane and a truck are both vehicles . One has a pilot , and one has a driver . What 's the difference ? " " Why just small packages ? " Federal Express was asked by financial analysts and others . " It 's a matter of economics first , " replied  | Smith , " and equally important , it presents a clear , unambiguous image to the public . We found our niche in the market . We 're not carrying mice and elephants on the same plane like a lot of cargo outfits such as Airborne Freight , Emery Air Freight and Flying Tigers . We carry what a person can lift . " The Federal Express approach to presenting potential customers with a more efficient , quicker and often cheaper small package service was to adopt a systems approach to a systems problem . When he was asked , as he often was , by skeptics why he felt his fledgling Federal Express could do better than the great airlines in handling small packages , Smith would reply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't affected by the tunnel vision of most airline managements . Let me give you an example . The airlines ' solution to the nagging baggage handling problem is to let the passengers carry their own bags on board . " Since Smith had no intention of entering the passenger business at that time , Federal Express did not have the problems of dealing with people and handling their baggage . " People can squawk , while packages ca n't , " explained Federal 's planners . These particular differences made it possible for the company to implement a logistical system designed to serve shippers of packages , not passengers . Federal Express , if it could solve the logistical problems blocking the way of providing efficient overnight nationwide service , at least had an opportunity of becoming a successful transportation entity . The challenge to Federal was developing a system which could provide next day service at a reasonable price . A good portion of the nation had not previously been well-served . Could this idea of Smith 's work ? Could he really provide air shippers and consignees overnight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ major metropolitan markets ? And could it be profitable ? Since World War II , industry and people had been dispersing away from the older industrial centers of the East and Midwest . Many regional cities and towns in the South , Southwest , the Pacific Coast states , and in the Rocky Mountain area had been attracting industry since the 1950s and 1960s , or giving birth to their own home grown firms . Quick , efficient transportation was an important ingredient to successful economic development in these new , emerging regions . If a firm were located in New York , Chicago or Los Angeles it had good air freight service . But if it were located in Albuquerque , Reno , San Antonio or Wichita and dozens of other regional cities , then delivery dates were not on next-day basis . Two and three day delivery dates were common for priority air cargo . And service ? Service was totally unreliable . These changes gave Federal Express its chance to fill a void . No one wanted to wait very long for anything if it meant loss of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could find ways to reduce the time gaps between requests  | and delivery of parts , computer tapes , blueprints , contracts , radioactive isotopes and other high priority , time-sensitive items , they would find eager customers . Federal 's supreme logistical challenge was to find a way to serve these widely-dispersed regional , outlying cities and towns while also competing for business against the commercial airlines and the freight forwarders such as Emery . If Federal could provide overnight service to regional cities like Albuquerque , Charlotte , Jacksonville , . Portland ? whether in Maine or in Oregon ? and to smaller cities like Fort Smith , Macon and Williamsport , then tie them all together with the big metropolitan cities in a nationwide network , the company had the ideal support system for America 's emerging high technology and service industry economy . Smith , Frock , Bass and the others knew from their market research that throughout the United States each day there was a quantifiable demand for so many computer parts , for so many pieces of diagnostic medical equipment , and for so many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? that is the source of the demand ? was the unknown . The demand was quantifiable , but the distribution random . It was not possible on a daily basis to know precisely how many units of a radioactive substance or blood serum might be shipped from a pharmaceutical firm on Route 128 in suburban Boston to Rochester , Minnesota for Mayo Clinic use ; or how many Courier-Pak tube containers with engineering blueprints might be moving between Morrison-Knudsen 's world headquarters in Boise , Idaho , and a construction project site in Baytown , Texas . In solving this distribution problem , Federal Express planners borrowed ideas from package distribution systems used by the United Parcel Service ? better known as UPS ? and some of the interstate trucking companies . They also borrowed from the telephone company 's switching system to come up with its " hub-andspokes " concept . All packages and documents would be flown nightly , Monday through Friday , to a central sorting hub before being transshipped to their ultimate destination . As far as the customer was concerned , it really made no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fashion , or directly , from City A to City B. Since the package was an inanimate object which could not complain during its journey between pickup and delivery , the only concern originated with the customer who wanted Federal Express to deliver it to the consignee the next day on time . The non-linear system permitted service to a far greater number of points with fewer aircraft . And in addition , the central hub system helped reduce mishandling and delay in transit , because Federal Express kept total control over the packages from the pickup point through delivery . The system also permitted Federal Express the opportunity each night to match aircraft flights with  | package loads and re-route flights when the load volume required it . This flexibility permitted considerable savings in operating costs . Late in 1972 , Smith made the decision to locate the sorting hub ? the center of Federal 's radial distribution system ? at the Memphis International Airport . Smith 's decision to relocate to Memphis , his home town , was made for several reasons . Little Rock could not justify a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at that time in late 1972 , had not inaugurated its priority package airline operation . Smith knew the key people heading the Memphis and Shelby County Airport Authority . Surplus hangar space was available , and the Authority agreed to issue bonds to provide the improvements Smith needed to start operations . Fortunately for Fred Smith , he came to them at exactly the right time . The favorable lease terms provided by the Airport Authority to an unproven company with very limited capital was a stroke of good fortune for Smith and his associates . It is doubtful that any other major metropolitan airport would have made such a similar generous deal to an unproven company run by a 28-year-old with limited business experience . Memphis as a geographic location for Smith 's " huh-and-spokes " system , was considerably east of the geographic center point of the country . But in 1973 , at the time of the company 's formal beginning of the small package service , Memphis was close to the center of gravity of the initial target market cities for small packages . Moreover , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ viewpoint of uninterrupted service . Rarely had the airport been shut down because of fog , ice or snow . Cities further north and east of Memphis had considerably greater problems in the winter months keeping their airports operational . Federal 's Falcon jets flying east to Memphis from the western states would have a westerly tailwind and fewer stops offsetting the two hour time zone disadvantage from the Pacific coast , and one hour from the Mountain states . The Falcons returning west then would have a one to two hour time advantage to offset any unfavorable wind conditions . Smith 's refinement of his concept had picked up momentum . Armed with his consultants ' reports , and some new friends in Roger Frock , Art Bass , Mike Basch , Mike Fitzgerald and the White , Weld investment bankers , Smith prepared to implement his Federal Express which he described as " a special expedited service where the packages never stop moving with the primary conveyer being the airplane. "  | In late 1971 , Fred Smith was 27 years old and he was less than two and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Yale . A brief stint selling corporate jet aircraft was the sum of his business experience . But he had an idea for a small package airline , an idea which he felt had great promise if only he could obtain financial backing . In those days he was always trying out his ideas on anyone who might be interested . Pan American Business Jets , the business aircraft sales subsidiary of Pan American World Airways , offered Smith a friendly ear ? although it was not a selfless friendship . Pan Am held the exclusive U. S. distributorship rights for the Dassault Falcon 20 twin executive jet , a plane Smith thought to use for his Federal Express fleet . Since 1965 Pan Am had been marketing the French-built plane , with only mixed success , a success particularly jeopardized by the recession of 1969 and 1970 , which flooded the American market with corporate jet aircraft . Consequently , in 1971 , when Fred Smith seriously began to consider using the Falcon 20 as the foundation of his proposed fleet , Pan Am 's Business Jet Division was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pan Am had considered organizing its own air taxi fleet using the Falcon 20s . At that time , it also had tried to sell the idea to Executive Jet Aviation , a subsidiary of Penn Central . By the time Fred Smith visited Pan Am , they had had considerable time to think about the commercial uses of the Falcon .  | So when they sat down to talk , Fred Smith and Pan Am had a strong mutual interest . Federal Express became a prime customer prospect for Pan Am ; Pan Am became a major ally in the creation of Federal Express . Smith had been looking at the potentials of different aircraft since 1969 . He had taken serious looks at the Gulfstream G-1s as well as the Falcon 20s , but he had zeroed in on the Falcon 20s in 1971 because they had a bigger cubic capacity in the fuselage and the greater flight range . The Falcon had an overall length of approximately 56 feet and a wing span of 50 feet which allowed it to carry either ten passengers or three tons of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ airframe and undercarriage of the Falcon since it suggested the plane would be a good fleet workhorse . The Falcon 20 was the plane Smith wanted , if it could be modified from its physical configuration as a 12-seat corporate passenger jet to a cargo plane capable of hauling at least a three-ton payload . Smith thought he needed an aircraft with a payload at least that large if he were to enter the corporate freight market . If this modification could be made , then he would have a small , fast all-weather jet with the proper width and height for freight . The only other plane around in 1971 which could carry a similar payload was the slow , short-range 35-year-old DC-3 . The Falcon , when modified would have a speed of 540 mph and a range of 1,400 to 2,000 miles . In August , 1971 , Smith and Pan Am agreed to put a Falcon 20 into modification to serve as a prototype for his proposed minifreighter fleet . The board of the Smith family-controlled Enterprise Company agreed to guarantee a loan for $3.6 million to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choice of the Falcon 20 , however . The gross weight of the Falcon exceeded the limit permitted by the Civil Aeronautics Board for air taxis . Pan Am made suggestions for lightening the plane , but even with these changes , the plane 's weight exceeded the Part 298 limit for air taxis . In order for Smith 's plan to work , it would be necessary to get the CAB to change its regulations to permit a larger payload . Because Fred Smith was reasonably confident the CAB would make the change sometime in early 1972 , in early December , 1971 , his plan called for a fleet of 26 Falcons . He already owned two ; he would lease the other 24 . Of this proposed fleet , 23 would be in service with three in backup or in maintenance . The leased aircraft would cost about $6.6 million a year . " If we could fill the airplane each night , we could produce $66.8 million , providing before tax profits of $42.4 million , " Smith concluded in his financial plan prepared in late 1971 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from charter flights carrying cargo . " Between November 9 , 1971 , when his tentative operating plan  | called for the lease of 24 Falcons , and December 16 , 1971 , when he signed the contract with Pan Am to buy 23 Falcons , Smith changed his aircraft acquisition plan . What caused Smith to change his plans ? It was Pan Am 's decision to sell the planes it had been reluctantly storing out in the desert near Roswell , New Mexico , while waiting for the market to improve , a decision created by Pan Am 's desperate need for cash to save its Business Jets Division from bankruptcy . On December 17 , 1971 ? the day after Smith signed an option to purchase 23 Falcons from Pan Am for a purchase price of $29.1 million ? he got the Enterprise board to guarantee a $1,150,000 loan needed to secure this option . As the CAB 's Part 298 economic regulations stood in late 1971 , the Falcon 20 would not be feasible for Federal Express to use in its proposed small package business . Consequently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the CAB refused to relax its cargo payload restrictions . Early , 1972 , Smith went out on the open market and bought eight used Falcons . With the two initial Falcons he had purchased outright in 1971 , the 23 he had under option with Pan Am , and the eight used planes , Smith had a fleet of 33 aircraft . But since the final planes did not join the fleet until 1974 , it took some 30 months to assemble it . Including costs of modification , plus interest charges , the total cost was $56.1 million . Smith was elated . He felt he had cornered the market for Falcons , and had purchased the planes at bargain rates . If his plans for his air freight operation collapsed , they could be sold at a profit . Selling corporate jets was a business Fred Smith knew well ; he had his emergency exit covered . Pan Am , which had been so anxious to sell Fred Smith its surplus inventory of new Falcons in late 1971 , exerted tremendous pressure on Federal Express in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take delivery of the planes and to pay up . Originally , Smith had agreed that Federal Express would accept delivery of one Falcon per week beginning September 28 , 1972 . Federal Express requested a delay on this original commitment and agreed to pay Pan Am an increase in price as a penalty . On November 1 , 1972 , a second delay was negotiated , again with financial penalties . And then , because of its further deepening financial crisis , Federal Express had to request a further delay on January 31 , 1973 . Negotiations between Pan Am and Federal Express on this issue were at times bitter because Pan Am desperately needed the cash . Its Business Jets Division was bankrupt at that point , and it was in no mood for further compromise . " One of those senior vice presidents at Pan Am was a real S.O.B . " remembers Frank Watson , counsel at that time for Federal Express . " I spent 23 days in New York trying to work out a deal to keep Pan Am from selling the Falcons out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We had to play real hardball to keep the agreement alive . At times  | it was all but dead . Federal Express almost died at these bitter meetings . " The final head-to-head negotiations with Pan Am resulted in Federal Express agreeing to issue Pan Am warrants to purchase common stock . Federal Express under this new agreement in January , 1973 , was permitted to take all of the planes on or before May 15 , 1973 , subject to a price increase on each aircraft of $1,500 for each day delivery was delayed beyond March 31 , 1973 . May 15th became the most critical date in Federal 's history up to that point . It was a " do-or-die " target date . Banks in Little Rock and Memphis helped Federal Express finance the purchase of the used Falcons purchased on the open market with short term , demand notes . Worthen Bank in Little Rock financed six planes in early 1972 , and was so proud of its association with Federal Express that its television commercials showed Federal Express Falcons blasting off into the sunset @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " A year later , in the summer and fall , 1973 , Worthen Bank wondered whether it was a good idea after all . By that time Worthen and some small town Arkansas banks that held participations in the $8 million indebtedness were gravely concerned . Said one close Federal Express observer : " Those little banks over in East Jesus , Arkansas , were really sweating those loans . They were more than happy to lend Fred Smith the money back in 1972 . Here was young , successful Fred Smith with a fat family inheritance to backup his ventures . They did n't think they had a thing to worry about . It never dawned on them that Fred might have trouble getting his permanent financing to help pay off the short term loans on the two original Falcons he bought from Pan Am , and the eight used Falcons he had purchased on the open market . " During this period Smith called on Commercial Credit Equipment Corporation ? known as CCEC ? a subsidiary of Control Data Corporation headquartered in Baltimore . CCEC had known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At that time , Smith had used some of his funds from his inheritance to help his stepfather purchase controlling interest in Arkansas Aviation in Little Rock . Afterwards , when Arkansas Aviation got heavily into debt , Smith ? still in Vietnam ? arranged to make good on a deficiency of $100,000 . As a result CCEC , one of the creditors , was particularly impressed with him . In May , 1972 , Smith outlined his ideas for his priority small package airline with the CCEC staff . He gave them copies of the A. T. Kearney and the Aerospace Advance Planning Group consuli , ants ' reports in which both firms concluded there was a huge , unserved market for priority air cargo . Meanwhile , the board of the Enterprise Company resolved to purchase $2 million of Federal Express common stock , and to  | guarantee $2 million of a proposed $13.8 million loan from CCEC . The assets of Enterprise were to back up this $2 million loan guarantee . On July 8 , 1972 , CCEC signed the agreement lending Smith and his Federal Express @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was secured by a first mortgage , a $2 million pledge of collateral by Enterprise , as well as by the personal guarantee of Fred Smith . The Part 298 matter still had to be resolved if Federal Express were to fly the Falcons as cargo freighters . The CAB strictly forbade any air taxi operator to put a plane in the air that had a maximum takeoff weight exceeding 12,500 pounds . Since the Falcons far exceeded this weight limitation , Federal needed relief from the CAB if Smith 's plan was to proceed . Federal 's plan required it to be classified as an air taxi operator under Part 298 regulations . Air taxi operators , under the law , could fly when and where they liked throughout the United States . They were a special class of carriers existing outside the basic certificated structure that had been in place since the Civil Aeronautics Act of 1938 . This freedom to fly where and when it wanted was essential to Smith 's operating plan . Oral hearings on the subject of revising Part 298 began at the CAB in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ final decision before fall , 1972 . Fred Smith nonetheless proceeded with confidence that the issue would be resolved in his favor so he could use the Falcons . The proposed change for air taxi operators was to eliminate the 12,500 pound takeoff weight limitation and replace it with new regulations permitting air taxis to fly aircraft with a 30 passenger seat limitation and a payload capacity up to 7,500 pounds . There was considerable opposition within the certificated carrier group to the proposed change . They felt that any significant expansion of Part 298 authority would be a threat to them . Perhaps , they were right , since they were tightly restricted as to routes and to tariffs . The opposition was particularly strong from several certificated local service airlines who claimed any change would create unfair competition for them from air taxis operating legally outside the certificated structure . Fred Smith was advised to seek experienced Washington counsel on the Part 298 matter , because , he was told , the CAB rules were complicated and it was important to get direction from someone who knew the ropes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a respected Washington attorney , and his firm . After examining the status of the Part 298 regulation , the firm advised Smith any change in Part 298 would probably be challenged in the courts . It also foresaw problems for Federal Express further into the future , even if Part 298 were changed to permit a maximum 7,500 pound payload . Counsel felt if Smith carried through in his plan for a large-scale air operation , Federal Express would be forced  | to seek CAB certification status later on . On July 18 , 1972 , Part 298 was amended by the CAB which permitted the 30-passenger seat , or the maximum 7,500 pound payload ? effective September 17 , 1972 ? the Falcon 20 was now qualified and Federal Express was on safe ground . In late 1972 , petitions for review of the CAB 's order were filed in the U. S. Court of Appeals , District of Columbia Circuit by Hughes Air Corporation , North Central Airlines , and the Air Line Pilots Association . With the Court 's announcement on December 5 , 1973 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a dark cloud which had hung over the first eight months of the small package business was dispersed . The decision not only meant Federal could proceed safely but also the company could purchase the remaining Falcons to complete its fleet . " If the court had ruled in favor of Hughes and the others , there would n't have been a Federal Express , " concludes Nathaniel P. Breed , Jr. , the company 's Washington-based legal counsel . " The certification process would have had a crushing effect on the company 's ability to obtain the financing which it desperately needed to survive and put its system in place . " Early in May , 1972 , Smith announced that Federal Express had its operating plan and personnel in place , and was going to hire new employees . Heretofore , his staff had been Irby Tedder , his right hand man at Arkansas Aviation Sales , and several of his corporate jet salesmen . The first people he hired were mostly people he knew , or friends and relatives of people Smith and Tedder knew . Smith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had an approximate idea of the type of people who were needed and he set out to find them . Tucker Morse , for example , only recently relocated to Little Rock and only recently out of law school , was hired more or less over the backyard fence . He was visiting his parents who lived next door to Smith . When Smith suggested to Morse that he needed an attorney , Morse jumped at the chance . At the time the 27-year-old Morse was clerking for a law firm at a non-existent salary in order to gain experience . Word got around Little Rock and Memphis that Smith was hiring for Federal Express . One applicant is now his senior vice president for operations planning , Ted Weise . Weise had once worked for General Dynamics as a flight test engineer on the F-111 attack bomber program and had been out-of-work for a year before he went to see Smith in Little Rock about a job . Weise remembers the initial meeting as follows : Smith : " Why do you want to work for me ? " Weise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hell , do n't you want to make some money ? I like airplanes too , but I 'd like to make some money , too . " The money Smith was referring to was obviously not the initial  | salary of $700.00 per month he offered Weise . Weise was happy with the job , and the $700.00 was a welcome sight . Smith appealed to the entrepreneurial spirit of most of those he hired . He particularly wanted his key management positions filled with what he called " entrepreneurial-types . " He was looking for the same " right stuff " competitive qualities and toughness that , according to author Tom Wolfe , NASA officials sought when they screened the ranks of the jock fighter pilots and test pilots to come up with John Glenn , Alan Shepard , Wally Schirra and the other members of the original astronaut team . " He was very persuasive , " recalls Roger Frock ( B.S. , Engineering ; MBA , Michigan ) , who quit A. T. Kearney in May , 1972 , to join Smith in Little Rock after completing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oral commitment . He said if Federal Express succeeded , I would get stock . There was nothing written and I did n't expect anything written . I took a big pay cut going down to Little Rock from New York . But I was 35 , and I wanted to take the plunge in a risk venture . " Frock was appointed general manager at a salary of $36,000 , a figure $1,000 more than Smith himself made . The 10 years of experience Frock had at A. T. Kearney conducting distribution logistics and cargo handling studies for transportation clients made him a key employee . He was well-organized , a good technical planner , and he could prepare the type of in-depth reports Smith needed for presentations to potential investors and banks . Smith used executive " headhunters " to find many key technical personnel . " If anyone he wanted showed a reluctance to accept his offer , he 'd really go to work on them , " says Art Bass . " Fred 's face would light , and he 'd paint this glowing portrait of how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that they ought to be part of this adventure . Of course , Little Rock was the end of the Earth to some of these fellows and their families , but Fred Smith successfully overcame most of their concerns . " A wife of a prospect from Connecticut was reported to have told her husband : " Why I would n't be caught dead in Little Rock . " Arthur C. Bass ( B.S. , Middlebury ) , then 40 , joined Smith in the Fall , 1972 . About Art Bass it may be said that not only did he have the reputation as a resourceful conceptual planner with special talents in marketing , but also he had the good looks of the pilot adventurer to project the image Smith sought in those days ? tall , handsome , lanky build with a broad boyish smile . In short , " the right stuff . " His early assignments at Federal Express were in developing the marketing plan and handling industrial relations . Three years later , in 1975 , he would be elevated to the presidency during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ performance . One insider says admiringly of Bass , " He 's one of the few top guys Fred hired who did not have a big ego problem . Many of those  | other guys at times were insufferable . Art is n't a numbers guy , or an MBA-type running around with fixed solutions to every problem . He can grasp and handle a broad range of ideas and sort them out . He was the most popular fellow in the company . " Michael D. Basch ( B. A. , Clarkson Tech ) another key aide hired by Smith , had extensive experience at UPS in sales , planning and industrial engineering . Basch , like Art Bass , was equally handsome , personable , easy-going and related well with the staff Smith was assembling . At first he was assigned to sales and customer service ; then later put in charge of planning the central hub in Memphis where all of the packages collected throughout the system would be sorted each night . Basch convinced a friend from his UPS days , Mike Fitzgerald ( B.A. , Northeastern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these handsome store-window barn-stormers , knew the small package distribution system well from his experience at UPS . He was 36 when he came to Little Rock to take over as head of sales and customer service . S. Tucker Taylor ( B.A. , Yale ) and Vince Fagan ( B.A. , Hofstra ; M.S. , New York University ) closed their consulting firm , AAPG , and also an advertising agency they were running in New York in 1974 to come to Memphis to complete Smith 's initial management team . Taylor and Art Bass had done much of the primary research work of the AAPG study Smith had commissioned in late 1971 . And both Taylor and Fagan had done some advertising and promotion assignments for Smith in 1972 and 1973 . They had intimate knowledge of what Smith hoped to accomplish in this package airline . " Come to Federal Express and I 'll pay you a salary , " Smith told them . Chuckles Taylor , " We came down to Memphis in 1974 because Smith owed us so much money . That was the only way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of macho there and that appealed to Vince and me . We had jock mentalities and we thought we 'd be happier there than working for some conservative corporation . We did n't know what convertible bonds were in those days and we wore cheap suits . " Taylor , then 34 , was known as a free spirit . He admitted he knew very little about running a business . Smith viewed him as having a creative mind and assigned him to tough , demanding special corporate projects . Vince Fagan admitted he surprised himself by joining Federal Express as senior vice president for marketing , a company which was by then headquartered in Memphis . Fagan was a native New Yorker who felt uncomfortable living anywhere else , and Memphis was not his idea of a cosmopolitan city . Fagan , then 38 when he joined the team , brought to Federal Express many years of experience in the advertising industry as well as significant contacts since a number of his clients had been aviation firms .  | Smith needed good people willing to take risks like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were the individuals who stepped forward . None had any extensive corporate managerial experience to contribute . They were mostly individuals with a strong entrepreneurial interest which Fred Smith was able to cultivate . Several thought the experience would be fun working in what Smith told them would be an atmosphere where they could be iconoclastic about existing traditions in the air freight industry . What Smith had done with some skill was to bring together in one group air transportation talent and mix them with experienced , rough-and-ready ground trucking people . Of these early years of the company Art Bass remembers : " I am not sure of the ingredients that made a good cake , but the one that fell off the shelf was a good one . This assemblage of creative talent at the outset is what distinguished Federal Express from many contemporary companies . " Smith hired many people with extensive technical experience with airlines or with aircraft maintenance firms . The first pilots hired were often former military fliers , or corporate jet pilots who knew the operational qualities of the Falcons . There were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ positions in the 1972 and 1973 period . Fred Smith consciously made an effort not to hire commercial airline pilots , because he said adamantly , " I do n't want steely , blue-eyed executives with pilots ' caps . " He also knew he could n't pay them going airline salaries . Federal 's Veterans Administration-approved Flight Training School started at Little Rock in October , 1972 , to train pilots for the Falcons . The federal government paid most of the $8,800 tuition for the intensive two-week course , producing an excellent double benefit for Federal Express ; on the one hand , Federal received a pool of pilots trained to fly the Falcons , and on the other hand , the company received a source of revenue badly needed in late 1972 and 1973 . Over one year 's time some 273 pilots were trained there . Federal gave up the program after a little over a year when it could no longer offer jobs to those graduating . Managing the company efficiently proved to be difficult that first year , 1972 . " Smith and his key @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says Irby Tedder smiling wanly , the company 's original financial officer . " They all came in with a lot of wild ideas of how to put Federal Express together , and only a few of them made any sense . They were an impetuous bunch . " Early internal policy and administrative decisions were often hammered out in " knock down-drag out " meetings extending late into the night . Sixteen hour days were common . Bitter disputes would sometimes occur , and Smith would lose his temper . As Tedder remembers , " Fred would get real tense . Once in a while he 'd throw something against the wall . So we would try to get him drunk at some bar , hoping it would relax him , and perhaps keep him away  | from the office the next day . But he 'd come bouncing back early the next morning ready to take on the world again , and get back in the thick of everything going on . " Norman Timper , who had retired from United Airlines and who was used to the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upset with Smith and his key aides because he felt they were devoting too much time to studies about how they could improve the cockpit instrument equipment in the Falcons . " Top management is too hard pressed to devote time to these evaluations , " Timper pleaded with them . " These decisions should be handled by the Engineering Department . " The Accounting Department was a disaster area . There were no formalized , internal controls . Haphazard records caused reports to be late . Cash flow was hurt by the lag in billings . " Instead of concern about this serious problem , Fred would often worry about some minor office problem , " reports one of the early accountants . " He was a real nitpicker in those days . He had his hand on everything . " Winning major contracts became the company 's mission in the early part of 1972 . Smith did not necessarily want to fly mail for the U. S. Postal Service , but he realized Federal Express needed to develop credibility if it were to sell the priority small package airline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interim , buildup period . Federal Express was low bidder on six mail routes . Smith shaved the bids as low as he could to win these contracts . " We low-balled them in order to win these routes , " Watson confessed . " Fred cut the bids under what his close associates recommended . He really wanted these contracts . " Mail service to routes , primarily in the Midwest , started on July 10 , 1972 , under three-year contracts providing for service five nights a week . The charter air cargo service for industrial clients began unofficially on June 30 , 1972 . The CAB had not yet ruled on the petition to change Part 298 to permit up to a 7,500 pound payload for air taxi operators , so Federal Express could not legally charge for any freight service . As a result of the company 's selling efforts in Ypsilanti , Michigan , Ford Motor Company agreed to try Federal Express by asking it to fly a shipment of auto parts from Ypsilanti to Kansas City . Legally , Federal Express could not accept this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather than lose Ford as a prospective customer , Fred Smith personally picked up the load and flew it free . Ford wanted Federal Express to bill it , but Smith refused to do so . As much as he may have wanted to , he could not legally bill them . The charter sales approach was to tell prospects Federal Express , rather than offering the customer set schedules and routes , could offer them a service custom tailored to their needs . During the 1972  | charter cargo period , however , Federal Express offered no ground delivery service of its own . Instead , it contracted with local drayage firms to perform this task . The mission of the sales force in 1972 was to sell Federal 's service to large industrial shippers . Smith decided to convert his Arkansas Aviation Sales corporate jet salesmen into freight salesmen . This proved to be a mistake . " They were a flamboyant , unruly group who found it difficult to identify with the problem of selling charter freight services , " recalls Bill Arthur , a former marketing director @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and living it up on big expense accounts . They were out of their element . " Even so , Smith had anticipated initial losses in 1972 . The profit picture finally looked like this : the three original profit centers ? air mail , charter cargo and pilot training ? yielded $2.8 million in 1972 . Just over half came from the Postal Service contracts . Total expenses for that year were just over $3.7 million in 1972 , so that the actual operating loss was $927,845 . The total debt , on the other hand , at the end of 1972 , was $21.7 million . But Smith and his staff felt 1973 would yield far better results . At the beginning of 1973 , Smith bought Little Rock Airmotive , Inc. ? a firm often referred to as " LRA " . LRA had been Federal 's prime contractor for performing modification work on the Falcons which included installation of the cargo doors , revamping the cargo interior , installing the avionics , and painting the exterior the distinctive eye-catching purple , orange and white with " FEDERAL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planes . When Smith 's first Falcons arrived in Little Rock in 1971 , this firm was given the tough job of finding ways to reduce the bulk weight of the Falcon 20 while leaving the plane 's operational efficiency intact . As passenger aircraft , the Falcon 's door was only 59 inches wide and 311/2 inches high . In order to be able to ship bulky items like mainframe computers and palletized loads , which helped speed the turnaround time to load and unload the Falcons , a much larger door measuring 60 inches wide and 74 inches high was installed by LRA . LRA clearly had a major modification project in hand . Smith paid $2.5 million for LRA , even though at the time of the sale to Federal Express it had a net worth of only $1.2 million . Why was it , then , that Smith agreed to pay substantially more for this firm ? Nearly $1.3 million more ? The reason was that LRA was going bankrupt , because its major customer , Federal Express , had not paid for the extensive modification work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfect adjunct to Federal 's business . Now it could perform all its own modification work on the remaining Falcons to be delivered , plus undertake general corporate aircraft customizing for clients beyond the company as an additional source of income . Smith borrowed the money for the acquisition from the same Worthen Bank in Little Rock which had lent him the money  | to purchase some of the Falcons . Stephens , Inc. , a diversified and powerful Arkansas-based investment banking firm and the parent organization of LRA , was very concerned about the huge debt Federal Express had run up . " We had Jack Stephens over a barrel , " muses Frank Watson . " He had to sell LRA to us or see it go bankrupt . In effect , with the Worthen Bank loan , we wiped out our obligation , and eliminated the possibility of a severe drain on our cash flow . We played a lot of hardball with the people to whom we owed money in those days to stay alive . " Equally important , this acquisition gave Federal complete control over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the company with a modern fully-equipped hanger at Adams Field in Little Rock for its own maintenance center , its flight school and office space . Early in 1973 , Federal Express shifted its base of flight operations from Little Rock to Memphis . The city of Little Rock had been asked to construct various physical improvements at Adams Field to accommodate the company . At the same time , the Memphis and Shelby County Airport Authority had agreed to lease Federal Express hangar facilities and to provide bond funds for renovating hangars , building an administrative building and a cargo sort building . Memphis had a large modern airport with an aggressive management interested in promoting additional revenue generating activities . Smith gave Little Rock the opportunity to match this attractive offer from Memphis . This was a sensitive matter . Congressman Wilbur Mills who had helped Smith was unhappy about Federal 's plan to leave Little Rock because the company was providing badly needed jobs . Mills tried to persuade Little Rock public agencies to spend the funds to improve Adams Field , but they showed no interest . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realized why Federal chose Memphis and held no animosity toward it . Work started in January , 1973 , and by early March a system capable of handling 10,000 packages per hour was completed . This early hub was a primitive structure by later standards , but at least it was capable of helping Federal Express get started in its small package service . March 12 , 1973 , was selected as the inaugural night of service . The operational test took place in an 11-city network extending from Dallas on the west to Jacksonville and Atlanta on the east . Kansas City , St. Louis and Cincinnati were the northernmost cities in this initial system . Reports from the salesmen in the field the afternoon of March 12 were very optimistic . That night Federal Express employees and their families gathered near the sorting facilities looking up into the midnight sky waiting for the Falcons to come in . Henry W. " Brick " Meers , representing  | White , Weld &; Company ? the investment banking firm ? was there to observe the results of the first night of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they waited , " reminisces Meers . " Most were very worried about their future . It was a critical moment for all of them as they finally crowded around the Falcons and the cargo doors opened . But as they gazed inside , there was bitter disappointment . There were only six packages and one of them was a birthday present Fred Smith sent to his close aide , Irby Tedder . " In looking back on that disappointing night , Mike Fitzgerald who was in charge of the field sales force lamented , " We realized then that we did n't have enough cities and people had n't heard of us . This introduction was a bust . " The March 12th disappointment forced the company to go back and re-structure its network . Art Bass and Bill Arthur of the market planning group , and Charles Brandon , who had just recently joined Federal Express to head the operations research program , locked themselves in a room at the Union Bank in Little Rock where Smith still had his office . Here without benefit of computer assistance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assistance ? they rebuilt the distribution network . On the second try , the night of April 17th , the network had been expanded to a 25-city system and the plan was to add four additional cities every two weeks for the next several months . The northernmost point in the April , 1973 , network was Rochester , New York ; and the southernmost point , Miami . Dallas and Kansas City were geographic limits of service to the west of Memphis . During the late afternoon of April 17th , the projected package count called in to Mike Fitzgerald from the field stations was 163 . Actually , when the cargo doors opened there were 186 packages . There was an air of optimism that night . An internal memorandum circulated to employees the next day announcing proudly , " We are launched ! " The horrible memory of the night of March 12th had been erased . Not only does Federal Express never mention publicly this fatal night but also the public relations staff has always claimed April 17 , 1973 , as the night Federal Express started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Express had ever known such an initial failure . To do so might make Federal Express seem a less heroic venture than it was , might make it seem a more human one . The May , 1973 , nightly package count averaged 473 , but in the later part of July the nightly count moved over the 1,000 mark . And by October , 1973 , the month just prior to the $52 million credit agreement , the nightly average was 2,517 . The program of matching Falcon flight schedules with loads kept planners busy each night revising route patterns . The market research staff tested package counts for the various cities with the data produced by their package forecasting models to check their accuracy .  | The period May to October , 1973 , was one of trial and error as workable systems for handling packages , for billing and for attracting business were developed . Federal 's operation seemed to be consciously patterned after that of the United Parcel Service . The price schedules , the report forms and even the selling techniques were the same initially . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policy of UPS for sales people and executives were implemented by the company . Federal had hired many UPS people in the beginning , and they brought the UPS system with them . Reflecting on these days some Federal Express veterans have admitted they placed too much reliance on the UPS techniques . " We did n't have much time to experiment on our own , " says one veteran . " We were trying to survive the best we could . And UPS was the best at handling small packages on the ground . " Getting Federal Express known to the business public , and converting prospects into sales , was a hard struggle during the summer and early fall , 1973 . On August 1 , 1973 ? after almost three and one-half months of operations ? the daily package count was only 112 for New York , 91 for Chicago , 52 for Philadelphia , 19 for St. Louis , 13 for Detroit , and 9 for Denver . The company was still unknown . In September , 1973 , Ted Sartoian , a former UPS salesman , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bill Lackey whose experience had been as a corporate jet salesman . Almost immediately Sartoian introduced the approach used by UPS successfully , team selling . He led sales teams of eight persons into different cities to contact in a one or two week period all the big shippers in those cities . It was a quick-hitting , saturation campaign designed to get immediate results . Sartoian , a colorful and enthusiastic , energetic motivator , fired up his salesmen with such statements : " The name of the game is packages , boxes and bundles and service , " or " Get the Elephants , the rabbits will come automatically . " Of course , the slogans were trite , but they were standard motivational fare for those doing direct selling . In late 1973 , Federal Express , after much experimentation with its sales promotion program , concluded that its backbone accounts should be those industrial customers who could not afford to duplicate inventories in warehouses located all over the country . Company planners realized perhaps they should have been trying to attract the same type of customers as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had traditionally done a heavy volume of business with industrial customers . UPS served a much different clientele and carried primarily consumer-oriented , non-priority-type parcels . Federal Express identified its target market as some 37,000 businesses and industries located in the 100 leading U. S. metropolitan markets , markets which were then accounting for 84 percent of all domestic air shipments .  | Financing Federal Express did not seem to be an insurmountable hurdle to Fred Smith when he started acquiring Falcon 20 fan jets from Pan American . Local banks readily provided him with interim financing in the Spring , 1972 , and CCEC , the Baltimore-based finance company , had made a 10-year loan on his initial fleet of ten Falcons . But to succeed in assembling the entire Falcon fleet of 33 planes and ground support equipment and operating funds , Smith needed equity capital . Enterprise Company , the family 's private trust , had the resources to invest heavily in Federal Express , but not nearly to the extent of the total equity required by the venture . Smith needed to raise considerable equity funds and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 7 , 1972 , until November 13 , 1973 , when the $52 million financing package was signed , Fred Smith 's enormous energy was almost totally consumed trying to get commitments from groups of venture capitalists and lenders . At the same time , Smith held at bay a legion of creditors demanding payment and threatening foreclosure , or its equivalent ? confiscating the Falcons . When asked to describe this period by attorneys representing his two half-sisters , Fredette and Laura , in a 1976 deposition hearing in Memphis , Fred Smith fired back : " No man on this Earth will ever know what I went through during that year , and I am lucky I remember my name much less the details that you are trying to ask me . With the trauma that year , the pressure  | was so great on me , and there were so many events that went on , and so much travel and so many meetings with investment bankers , General Dynamics , and a hundred different people who came down to Memphis , I just do n't recall specifics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ addition to trying to run a company at the same time . " Fred Smith had made some preliminary contacts in November , 1971 , with White , Weld &; Company , the old and established investment banking firm based in New York and Chicago . He was introduced to several partners by Buck Remmell ? the officer in White , Weld who had been introduced to Smith by a mutual friend in Little Rock . White , Weld , part of the establishment in investment banking , was a leader in managing corporate underwritings and in securing private placements for companies seeking capital . White , Weld was the firm , for example , which had arranged a number of private placements for Jim Ling in the late-1950s when this well-known Texas industrial entrepreneur was putting together Ling Electronics . Smith kept in close touch with White , Weld during the spring , 1972 . Progress reports were sent to them by Smith 's research consultants , A. T. Kearney and AAPG . " Third party opinions greatly soothed the trepidations of venture capitalists , " Smith had been told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ White , Weld senior officers were extremely enthusiastic about this proposed small package airline and expressed an interest in helping to raise sufficient capital to start the company . In September , 1972 , White , Weld wrote Fred Smith outlining the steps necessary for them to secure the financing . The plan called for Smith , or the family 's Enterprise Company , to invest $3,250,000 of their own funds . White , Weld had become very serious about Federal Express in late 1972 . It sent Homer Rees , one of its key people , to Little Rock for an extended period so he could assemble the operational and financial details of the company , and examine Federal 's corporate plan . This information was needed to include in an offering brochure to be circulated among a group of potential investors White , Weld felt might be interested in Federal Express . This was to be a private placement which meant White , Weld did not have to register the securities with the Securities and Exchange Commission . The resultant offering brochure contained this encouraging statement : " Starting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surpluses . " But at the end of January , 1973 , Federal Express was absolutely broke . Smith later admitted all it would have taken then was " just a little push , " and the company would have collapsed . White , Weld contacted Smith on February 2 , 1973 , to request that he put another $1.5 million equity into Federal Express . This amount ? White , Weld told Smith ? was needed to trigger the deal . Up to that point , Federal Express had a paid-in capital of $3,250,000 . With this  | additional equity , the figure then would be $4,750,000 . The company desperately needed another cash injection , and Smith knew if he did not come forward with more money then Federal Express was out of business . On February 5 , 1973 ? three days prior to Smith 's signing the agreement with White , Weld ? Smith borrowed $2 million from Union Bank in Little Rock . To authorize the loan , he gave the bank a copy of a resolution of the Enterprise Company board signed by Memphis attorney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the debt would be secured by an assignment of a stock repurchase agreement between Fred Smith and the Frederick Smith Enterprise Company . It also certified that Fred Smith 's financial statement reflected a net worth of $7.2 million . On February 8 , 1973 , White , Weld and Smith signed an agreement . White , Weld agreed to try to place $16 million in equity securities and $4 million of 81/2 percent second mortgage notes due in 1980 , with warrants attached . The funds were to be used to support the permanent , long-term-debt financing necessary to acquire the Falcons plus provide the company with working capital . White , Weld agreed to use its " best efforts " to secure this private placement and they had optimistically expected to raise this $20 million by March or April , 1973 . Smith and his staff were now confident Federal Express would get the financial foundation they needed . Significantly , the White , Weld agreement to undertake the raising of $20 million also helped reassure several Little Rock and Memphis banks holding short term loans , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was discovered that not only was the resolution Smith had presented to the Union Bank on February 5 , 1973 , fictitious , but also that just an hour or so before he sat down with Union Bank officers to sign the loan papers , Smith had the document typed and then took it to his office upstairs at the Union Bank where he forged the signature of attorney Robert L. Cox . The details leading up to the loan came out in the federal trial in December , 1975 , in Little Rock before the U. S. District Court for Eastern Arkansas . Smith was on trial there for violating Section 1014 of Title 18 of the United States Code for defrauding a bank by using false documents . Prosecutor : " Were you pressured enough that you would do anything to get some money ? " Smith : " I would n't kill someone , no , sir . " Prosecutor : " . . . but you would submit a false and fictitious statement on a document to a bank to get it , would n't you ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . and that is correct , sir . " Smith was acquitted . His defense was that he had acted on behalf of Enterprise Company on previous occasions with the apparent approval of his sisters and other board members . He had a 38.5 percent beneficial interest in Enterprise , and at the time of the Union Bank  | loan he was president of the Enterprise board . Smith maintained he and Enterprise were virtually one and the same . And Smith insisted at his trial that the banker handling the loan knew he had signed Robert Cox 's name to the Enterprise Company resolution . With the $2 million loan Smith immediately bought $1.5 million in Federal Express stock as requested by White , Weld and used the balance to pay off some bank loans in Memphis and to cover several overdrafts . There can be no doubt that without the Union Bank loan Federal Express would have collapsed in early February , 1973 . Financial crises came with increasing speed , each hard on the heels of the next . By January , 1973 , the agreement with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Federal Express had negotiated a third delay on January 31 , 1973 , and had agreed to a penalty schedule to take effect in 60 days if it could not accept delivery of the Falcons on schedule . Until this revised agreement was struck , Smith feared Pan Am might sell the Falcons out from under Federal Express . This also would have sealed the company 's doom . Replacement Falcons could neither have been found quickly , nor on such favorable terms as had been granted by Pan Am . Smith continued his pursuit of short term loans in the first part of 1973 to meet the payroll and to keep Federal Express solvent . And once again , in the case of a $1 million short term loan from the First National Bank of Memphis , he had provided bank loan officers with a fictitious Enterprise board resolution as evidence of an Enterprise Company loan guarantee . Fred Smith might have remembered the cartoon in his 1962 Memphis University School Yearbook which showed him stranded on a tropical island with a smashed propeller in his hands ; nearby a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 11 years later , he was truly on that cartoonist 's island awaiting his fate . White , Weld had arranged for Fred Smith to make numerous presentations before venture capital groups all over the country . In March , 1973 , Smith made at least a dozen presentations to solicit interest . Most listened attentively , then wrote Smith politely : " We pass ' at this time . " Prudential Insurance Company informed Smith : " When Federal Express reaches the point of seeking more traditional financing , do keep Prudential in mind . " And Prudential ultimately became a major part of the Federal Express venture capital consortium . Discouragement set in by April , 1973 , when White , Weld was unable to attract enough interest among venture capital groups . The Dow-Jones Industrial Average had slid from near the 1,000 mark in January , 1973 , to the lower 900 range in April . Venture capitalists as a group had been gun shy about new venture start-ups since the late 1960s . Smith and his Memphis advisors were critical of White , Weld 's efforts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deliver  | without any difficulty . Charles Lea of New Court Securities faulted Smith for not understanding the difference in the financial meaning of the word " undertaking " and the word " commitment " as used by White , Weld . " They did n't guarantee to deliver $20 million as Smith believed , " Lea said . " Fred should have known that a private placement is an agency transaction . White , Weld agreed to undertake a search for this capital . They could n't commit to it . " Smith was greatly distressed because White , Weld and others like Prudential had been so euphoric . Explained the disgusted Smith : " Everybody was saying this is the most classical gap in the market . This is the next Xerox . I do n't think we thought it was speculative at all . We naively thought this was a sure thing . " At the end of April , 1973 , Federal Express had a deficit of over $4.4 million . Total stockholders ' equity had sunk to only $289,000 . Most of what Fred Smith had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invested , was gone . Once again , the end appeared imminent . It was during this dark period that Fred Smith received a telephone call from Henry W. " Brick " Meers , who was White , Weld 's resident partner in Chicago as well as vice chairman , asking him to come to Chicago . Meers , then 65 , was not only a leading investment banker , but also active throughout Chicago in many industrial and civic organizations ; he was also a trustee of the University of Chicago . So when he told Smith he had arranged an appointment on Friday , May 4th , for the two of them to see the legendary industrialist and financier , Colonel Henry Crown , Smith realized this might be the last hope to keep Federal Express alive . Henry Crown was then 77 years old , but still very active managing his enormous holdings of industrial and financial enterprises as well as his real estate interests , which included large investment positions in General Dynamics and in Hilton Hotels Corporation . Crown had been known for half a century @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his start in the rough and tumble sand and gravel business in Chicago , then moved on in later years to a variety of profitable investments . One of his biggest coups was buying a controlling interest in the Empire State Building in 1952 for $3 million , and then selling the building in 1961 for $65 million , free and clear of mortgages . At the time of Smith 's meeting with Colonel Crown , Crown was the controlling stockholder of General Dynamics , a major industrial conglomerate with one major component being in the aerospace industry , and which in 1973 had sales over $1.6 billion . Crown has been described as an " urbane , articulate , well-dressed and remarkably well-preserved " gentleman whose wealth was estimated to be well beyond the one billion dollar mark . This is the man who was once heard to remark , " Owing money has never concerned me , so long as I know where it could be repaid from . "  | When 28-year old Fred Smith and Brick Meers sat down with him , Crown listened to Smith 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a problem , however . Crown said his financial man was in the hospital recovering from a hernia operation , so he could not do anything until his aide reported back to work in a week or so . This was Crown 's style . He had never been known for making quick deals . " Fast deals are for suckers , " Crown once commented . One observer of the legendary Crown claimed , " When the Colonel gets into your deal , he knows the size of your underwear . " Time was of the essence to Smith . On May 15 , 1973 ? just 11 days hence ? the option to purchase 18 Falcons plus 36 jet engines from Pan Am was to expire . Brick Meers called the hospital and asked the bedridden aide if it would be all right for Fred Smith and him to visit his hospital room that afternoon . So while the patient was flat on his back , Smith and Meers spent that afternoon and evening filling Crown 's financial aide in on the details of the Federal Express proposal . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the next day in his office . He asked General Dynamics ' executive vice president for finance , Gorden E. MacDonald , and the corporation 's general counsel to meet with Fred Smith and Brick Meers to work out the arrangements . This was the first of several meetings that week in Crown 's office . Conference calls were arranged so that General Dynamics ' chairman , David S. Lewis , could give his approval to the arrangements . During the discussions it was pointed out that the Section 408 provision of the CAB regulations might prevent General Dynamics from taking control of an air carrier . Colonel Crown responded , according to Smith , that he could accomplish anything he damn well pleased in Washington and that Section 408 was the least of his concerns . And in addition , Crown felt Fred Smith was too young and inexperienced to be heading Federal Express and he told Brick Meers in Smith 's presence someone more experienced should be brought in . But Crown did not insist Smith step aside . On May 12 , 1973 , General Dynamics and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ General Dynamics agreed to guarantee loans to Federal Express totaling $23.7 million . For this accommodation , General Dynamics was granted an option to acquire 80.1 percent of Federal Express stock for a price of $16 million . The agreement also provided that Federal Express was to repay the working capital loan and was to secure alternative financing for its aircraft to release General Dynamics as guarantor if the 80.1 percent option was not exercised . And in the event it did not exercise its option , six percent of Federal 's stock would revert to General Dynamics as consideration for the loan guarantee . In an awesome display of power , Henry Crown , in Smith 's and Meer 's presence , called a top official at the First National Bank of Chicago , and asked him to make the $23.7 million loan to Federal  | Express . The bank officer agreed over the phone to do it . Crown had been a major customer of the bank since the 1920s and any request he made carried a lot of weight . But David Lewis said he preferred the loan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chase Manhattan . The short term loan came from the Chase ; its due date was September 17 , 1973 ? a scant four months away . According to the agreement with General Dynamics , Federal Express was prohibited from converting 14 of the 18 Falcons covered by loan guarantee , pending final completion of Federal 's financing program . Four of the Falcons had already been delivered to Little Rock Airmotive and were undergoing modification . Chase Manhattan assigned one of its younger loan officers to check periodically to see that Federal Express would not attempt to convert the 14 Falcons in violation of the loan agreement . But " as soon as these planes were delivered green ' ? that is unmodified to serve as a cargo freighter ? to Little Rock , Dick Yarmowich , one of Federal 's key aircraft technicians , would go right down the line cutting holes in the fuselages to start the cargo door modification work , " chuckles a veteran officer . " Dick was a real wild man with that torch . We needed these planes in the air soon . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was concerned , the loan from Chase Manhattan was authorization to proceed rapidly with its total development program . As Fred Smith remembers the restrictive terms of the agreement with General Dynamics achieved through Henry Crown 's intervention : " There was nothing else I could do but to agree to give General Dynamics controlling interest . We were in the soup . I really did n't think it would exercise the option because of the CAB 's regulations against air framers controlling airlines . " General Dynamics sent a 15-man technical team to Memphis on May 21 , 1973 ; and for the next month these technicians put in some 3,056 man-hours examining every aspect of Federal Express . The team interviewed all of Smith 's key people , examined the company 's plans , and prepared " best case , " " middle road , " and " worst case " forecasts for their superiors at corporate headquarters in St. Louis . General Dynamics ' engineers spent hundreds of manhours testing the landing gear and the cargo handling capabilities and dozens of other physical and operational characteristics of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ success in raising venture capital , because investors insisted on having this technical detail before committing themselves one way or the other . On July 12 , 1973 , the report was completed and copies sent to General Dynamics ' chairman , David Lewis , and to Gorden MacDonald . The conclusions were generally favorable . The General Dynamics project team reported that Federal Express had achieved some excellent results for such a new company . It was impressed with  | Federal 's ability to respond quickly to problems and to react to opportunities . And financially , the team expected Federal Express to be a profitable operation in fiscal year 1974 . Even though the General Dynamics option to acquire Federal Express had technically expired on July 16 , 1973 , three days later , on July 19th , the General Dynamics board of directors ? largely through the influence of its outside directors ? turned down for the second time the opportunity to purchase Federal Express . This was a setback for both David Lewis as well as Fred Smith . Lewis had recommended to his board favorable action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to be part of General Dynamics . He had several sons Smith 's age and discovered they had a lot in common . They were both Episcopalians , Democrats , and Southerners , though Lewis was a native of South Carolina . He genuinely like Fred . General Dynamics gave several reasons for the board 's negative decision . First , it was worried about Section 408 which required any person or organization with a controlling interest in an air carrier be subject to CAB approval . Secondly , General Dynamics had just reopened its Quincy Shipyard in Massachusetts , and had imposed financial restraints on itself due to previous losses with that operation . Brick Meers observed , " General Dynamics ' plate was full . They had too many other worries on their minds . And several of David Lewis ' key people wanted to get rid of that tar baby ' called Federal Express . " But General Dynamics did not totally abandon Federal Express . It agreed to continue as guarantor on the Chase loan . And later , in order to mollify Worthen Bank , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purchase one Falcon for $1,550,000 and then lease it back to Federal Express . As a result , the Worthen Bank in Little Rock temporarily cancelled its threat to call its loan on Federal Express , an action which probably would have caused a shutdown of operations . When Fred Smith left the final General Dynamics board meeting on July 19 , he was very discouraged . He told Jessica Savitch of NBC News in an interview : " I was in Chicago when I was turned down for the umpteenth time from a source I was sure would come through . I went to the airport to go back to Memphis , and saw on the TWA schedule a flight to Las Vegas . I won $27,000 starting with just a couple of hundred and sent it back to Memphis . The $27,000 was n't decisive , but it was an omen that things would get better . " In those days , even Fred Smith the former financial golden boy , needed an omen in the face of what must have seemed to him to be an irrational universe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made to find a source of capital . Brick Meers and Gorden MacDonald contacted New Court Securities Corporation , a New York-based investment banking and  | venture capital firm organized in 1967 by the European-based Rothschild international banking dynasty . This was the second time in 1973 New Court Securities became part of the drama . In March , 1973 , New Court had received a copy of the White , Weld private placement offering . Charles Lea , then executive vice president of New Court , and his colleague Richard H. Stowe , went to Memphis to see the Federal Express operation first hand . Lea was again in Memphis on the night of April 17 , 1973 , and was a witness at the sorting hub when the Federal Express planes brought in a combined yield of only 183 packages . This meager yield was a sobering sight for Lea . " We did n't think Federal Express was living up to its plan , and we lost interest , " Lea explained when he told Brick Meers and the other White , Weld people New Court was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Court changed its mind in July and agreed to co-manage the search for capital with White , Weld . By that time both New Court and White , Weld felt Federal Express was coming closer to its volume forecasts and its prospects were more promising . There was also an indication Prudential would invest $5 million and that General Dynamics would also put up $5 million . If these two sources came through , then the goal at that time was to raise another $10 million . Prudential 's interest was a surprise on two points . First , it was rare for Prudential to put an amount as large as $5 million into a venture capital deal . And secondly , just a few months earlier it had written Fred Smith that it was not interested in being a participant . But here was another instance where Wilbur Mills had come to Fred Smith 's rescue . Mills , when I asked him about his role , replied : " Sure , I knew the people at Prudential , and I called them on Fred 's behalf . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to put in a good word for Smith . General Dynamics still wanted to help Smith , and the $5 million commitment did not put it in conflict with Section 408 . As long as it had no controlling interest in Federal Express , it did not need CAB approval . " After Brick Meers and Gorden MacDonald called New Court in July , we jumped on the assignment immediately , " recalls Lea . " Rick Stowe along with Brick Meers of White , Weld called everybody they knew . They had calls out to the venture capital groups at Citicorp , Bank of America , First National Bank of Chicago , Prudential and a whole bunch of venture capital fellows like Allstate 's Dave Seidman , Ned Heizer in Chicago , Phil Greer in San Francisco and a whole lot more . " Those showing an interest were invited to come to Memphis one week later for a formal presentation by Federal Express , and by the General Dynamics project staff who had just recently completed the full scale feasibility study of Federal Express . This meeting was  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dynamics . While these presentations were impressive to the potential investors in attendance , several were very concerned Federal Express might not survive until the financial package could be put together by White , Weld and New Court . Heavy losses continued through the summer months and the early fall : Fred Smith and the family-owned Enterprise company had seen their investments vanish . By September 30 , 1973 , the deficit had reached $7.8 million . By that date liabilities exceeded $46.7 million . Federal Express was just barely alive , and living from day-to-day . Lenders grew very nervous . Chase Manhattan Bank wanted to get out of its loan even before the due date . By September 14 , 1973 , the $23.7 million Chase loan was in default , and by that point several major loans from Memphis and Little Rock banks were also in default . Moreover , Federal 's working capital loan from General Dynamics was past due . To say that things looked very bleak for Federal Express in September would be classic understatement . Lenders had good reason to be seriously concerned about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Worthen Bank in Little Rock , It had loaned Federal Express nearly $8.7 million , and the loans were all due on October 31 , 1973 . The Bank 's loan limit was $2.5 million so it had syndicated out parts of its loans to several small town Arkansas banks . Almost weekly Worthen Bank would send Pete Marls , a young loan officer , to Memphis to talk with Fred Smith and try to encourage him to reduce the outstanding balance . " He did n't pay any attention to us , " recalls Maxis . " There really was n't anything he could do until the company got its permanent financing and the equity funds New Court and White , Weld were trying to raise . " Smith was able to convince Worthen that if it foreclosed , it faced several years of litigation , plus its action would cause the total collapse of Federal Express . " It was a close call , " Federal 's Irby Tedder told me . " Every time Worthen 's people came around , word was passed to keep the Falcons from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been the end of Federal Express . " Delays in the arrangement of the financing package were causing turmoil . There were mounting vendor suits against the company . Accounts receivable from suppliers exceeded $3.6 million at the end of September and , to make matters worse , the State of Arkansas was pressuring the company for sales and use taxes it claimed were owed it . Creditors were literally everywhere . The company was having trouble meeting its payroll . In a memorandum dated September 14 , 1973 , from Fred Smith and Roger Frock to Federal 's employees , was the following request : " With the most profound regret , we would like to request from each of you that you do not cash or deposit your payroll check until next  | Monday , September 17 , at the very earliest . " Federal Express was not only in danger of losing its planes but , if payroll funds were not forthcoming , possibly its employees as well . One memorandum , dated August 20 , 1973 , had been sent to employees telling them permanent financing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Another memorandum , dated September 24 , 1973 , told them the closing was scheduled for no later than October 15 . If the company were to go bankrupt , Fred Smith and the Enterprise Company stood to lose $7.9 million . Fred Smith had invested $2.5 million and the Enterprise company $2,250,000 . In addition , Enterprise company had guaranteed $3,150,000 of Federal Express indebtedness . Federal Express hung by one of those proverbial threads as Brick Meers , Charley Lea and Rick Stowe tried to hold together the venture capital group they had assembled , and to solve major concerns of the lender group . There were 23 venture partners lined up in October , 1973 , pledging a total of $23 million . New Court Securities and the investments groups it represented were committed to just under $3.3 million . There were two groups pledging $2 million each ? the venture capital arm of Allstate Insurance and the Heizer Corporation . The rest of the equity participants , including two bank SBIC venture capital groups , pledged smaller amounts . E. F. " Ned " Heizer , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in October . " First Ned was in ; then he was out ; then he was back in again , " said Rick Stowe . The Arab oil crisis made Heizer nervous , as it did several others of those whom New Court had lined up . The Arab nations told the world on October 19 , 1973 , they were going to cut off oil exports to force a change in the Middle East policy of the United States . They were upset about the pro-Israeli policy of the United States and about our sale of arms to Israel . Heizer 's commitment of $2 million was a particularly large one for a non-institutional venture capital group in 1973 . The plunging stock market and the debacle among ill-conceived high technology and service ventures in the period after 1969 , had scared off most venture capitalists . Heizer 's concern was probably justified . One of the venture capitalists said of Heizer , " Ned is a stubborn German . It 's difficult to get him to change his mind . He 's tough , and at times , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the telephone continually in New York , or in Chicago , or in Memphis trying to keep the venture capital group together and to hold on to the $23 million it had pledged . A venture capital unit of a small Chicago insurance company backed out , but despite all of the concerns brought forth by the various equity participants , this was the only group to withdraw .  | In late October , 1973 , Chase Manhattan disrupted the credit financing plan . It did not want to make the loan to Federal Express unless General Dynamics agreed to maintain the $23.7 million loan guarantee it had made with the Chase on the 18 Falcons . General Dynamics , however , was hesitant . General Dynamics ; White , Weld ; and New Court tried to persuade the Chase , the First National Bank of Chicago and the other banks in the lender group to make the loan to Federal Express without the General Dynamics guarantee , but with no success . Without the General Dynamics guarantee the credit rating on the loan went from a prime status to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loan among entirely different lending groups , and agreed to only a $4 million share . Meers and Lea considered this switch in direction by the Chase to be very unsatisfactory and to jeopardize the whole credit plan . Consequently , in the first week in October , 1973 , the credit agreement had stalled . On Friday , October 26th , Fred Smith made a final appeal to David Lewis of General Dynamics to break this impasse . In an impassioned , apparently handwritten letter , Smith told him that Lewis had in his hands the decision which would determine once and for all whether Federal Express would continue to exist or whether next Monday morning would bring " a catastrophic failure . " Smith mentioned that many people were responsible for the position Federal Express was in , and that General Dynamics shared in that responsibility . The distraught Smith told Lewis he could be reached by phone Saturday morning at the Union Planters Bank in Memphis and , if necessary , could be in St. Louis on two hours notice . Meanwhile in Chicago , Brick Meers called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ National Bank of Chicago , to tell him about the dilemma with the Chase and that the whole deal to finance Federal Express was about to collapse . Abboud asked Meers if he could call him back because he wanted to talk to his loan officers . Meers replied to Abboud : " You 'll get the whole horrible story from them , not only the fact that the General Dynamics loan guarantee was being eliminated , but also the facts on the performance of Federal Express . " When Abboud called Brick Meers back , Abboud groaned : " The story on Federal Express was much worse than you described it . . . . How much money do you want ? " Meers told him : " We need $10 million which we 'll use to try to get the Chase to match your $10 million , giving us a total of $20 million . " Abboud asked Meers if he would stay on top of the situation , and Meers promised he would . Abboud finally announced : " O.K. you 've got it . " Meers was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moments in this long and debilitating process . Yet Abboud 's help did not finally resolve the impasse . The Chase insisted that Smith or the Enterprise Company come up with an additional $4 million investment to make the deal go . Smith called a meeting of the Enterprise board in Memphis on November 6th and  | got it to approve an equity contribution of $1.5 million and a loan of $2.5 million secured by a second mortgage of the Falcons and other company assets . William L. Richmond , board member of Enterprise representing the National Bank of Commerce in Memphis , commented : " Enterprise stood to lose $5.4 million if Federal Express closed its doors . We had a tiger by the tail and we could not let it go at this point . " To resolve this conflict with the major banks , CCEC agreed to give up its $2 million collateralization request of the Enterprise Company on its loan on the 10 Falcons . And it was also agreed that two Memphis bank loans could be paid off with the proceeds of the permanent financing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's commitment to Federal Express was now up to $6,250,000 . Including Fred Smith 's own personal investment of $2.5 million , the total family involvement was thus , $8,750,000 . The $1.5 million equity contribution from Enterprise brought the venture capitalists ' share to $24.5 million . One half of each of the venture partners , investment was represented by shares of convertible preferred stock ; and the other half by subordinated promissory notes due October 1 , 1981 . The long term loan funds were primarily from the Chase Manhattan Bank , the First National Bank of Chicago and a group of regional banks . Out of this pool of $27.5 million , Federal Express was given a primary revolving credit sum of $20 million to use . A major portion of the loan was secured by a chattel mortgage on 23 Falcons . The credit agreement excepted the other 10 Falcons in the company 's fleet , which were security for Federal 's indebtedness to CCEC . The agreement also excepted the stock of Little Rock Airmotive which was security for the indebtedness owed to Worthen Bank . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subject to the prior interest of the bank lenders , the group which had first claim to the 23 Falcons in case of loan default . According to the credit agreement , the secondary revolving credit sum of $5 million could not be taken by the company until the first $22.5 million of the $27.5 million loan was fully utilized . The credit agreement stipulated that the $5 million loan could be triggered only if Federal Express were in compliance with the financial covenants contained in the credit agreement . This meant Federal Express would not obtain all of the $27.5 million at once . It had to comply with the strict terms of the credit agreement to get the total $27.5 million loan proceeds . To make this possible Federal had to become profitable ahead of the original company timetable . This stipulation may have been designed to motivate the company , but as things turned out it was not only unrealistic but also it was oppressive . The final signing ceremony for the credit agreement took place on Tuesday , November 13 , 1973 , in the offices of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Swaine and Moore at One Chase Manhattan Plaza in New York . The dominant headline in the New York Times Business/Economic Section that morning was : " Gasoline Rationing Hinted for January 1 . " The previous day the Dow-Jones Industrial Average was off 10.76 points , and closed at 897.65 in response to the widening energy crisis . The meeting began at 10:00 a.m. and lasted 5 hours and 55 minutes during which time at least 75 persons moved in and out of the room . " Nothing eventful happened , " remembers Brick Meers . " There were lawyers running around the room trying to clean up all of the defaults and get everybody paid off . It was really anticlimactic to what had been going on since early February . " One of the bank representatives , however , had a negative reaction to the whole affair . He said ruefully : " It was disgusting . Most of those financial people in that room did n't give a damn about Federal Express . They wanted their money ; or they wanted to position themselves to suck some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Finally at 3:55 p.m. it was over . He had persevered . Federal Express would survive . Frederick Wallace Smith would be known as a captain of industry , a model of success , a hero . But it had been close . A day or two later Fred Smith received a letter from New Court Securities with this compliment : " We believe if you are as successful in developing Federal Express as you were in convincing half the venture capitalists in America , we will all get very rich . " In December , 1973 , Federal Express issued bonus checks to all employees ranging from $15 to $100 . Fred Smith attached a note which said memorably : " Rome was n't built in a day . Possibly it could have been if Federal Express employees were in charge . " The company announced a wage increase effective January 1 , 1974 , and it promised there would be no layoffs . The early 1970s were not an optimistic period for venture capital undertakings . Investors with funds ordinarily were not interested in taking the plunge into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were selling at price-earnings ratios of four , or five , or six . How then did Federal Express defy the odds and succeed in attracting interest from a broad spectrum of investors and lenders ? Those involved in putting the Federal Express financing together felt Federal Express ' concept was exciting to equity investors . Simply put investors liked what they saw , and they were often spellbound with Fred Smith 's dramatization of what could lie ahead for Federal Express . He convinced them that a large , previously untapped market lay out there waiting for his Federal Express to mine it . In agreeing to finance Federal Express , the venture capitalises involved bypassed several of the principal requirements it is ordinarily said should be satisfied before funds are invested . One was that the potential must exist for an unusually large payoff within a couple of years at most . Two others were that there be quality management ,  | and that the entrepreneurial team assembled be proven winners . Paradoxically , at the time of the decision none of these conditions existed . " Maybe these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last gasp in 1973 before everything went down the drain in the American economy , " chuckled Art Bass when asked why . He adds , " It was the Snoopy and the Red Baron mentality of the lenders . They felt they were doing a very heroic thing in financing Federal Express . "  | The credit agreement signed on November 13 , 1973 , provided $52 million , but after all the previous creditors were paid off that day , Federal Express was practically out of operating funds . Survival depended on quickly gaining a strong foothold in the market . As a result emphasis had to be placed on marketing and sales to get the package volume and to get the cash flow to cover mounting expenses . Monthly revenues were falling far short of what had been projected in the company 's business plan for fiscal year 1974 , beginning on June 1 , 1973 , and ending May 31 , 1974 . Barring a miracle it seemed certain there would be a huge loss this first half of the operating year ending November 30 , 1973 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only problem . A new threat to Federal Express came in the form of an announcement from the federal government that effective November 1 , 1973 , airlines were to receive a fuel allotment on the basis of their 1972 consumption levels . Since Federal Express did not start operating on a daily basis until April 17 , 1973 , there would be no benchmark available to determine what volume the company should be given . With a characteristic blitzkreig , Pred Smith and his assistants swarmed on the newlycreated Energy Policy Office of the Department of the Interior in Washington to plead for special consideration .  | Smith 's luck held again . Using his characteristic dogged determination , he and his associates literally camped in the Energy Policy Office 's headquarters in Washington until they agreed to grant Federal Express relief . The outcome of this petitioning was that Federal Express was granted a fuel allotment of 40.9 million gallons , an amount which turned out to be far in excess of its actual need . Once more Federal Express had badly miscalculated , and the FEA 's generous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Here , they said , was a company getting special consideration which after eight months of operation had taken in only $2.4 million in revenues . It was not until the late 1970s , after Federal Express had assembled its initial fleet of Boeing 727s , that it would consume this quantity of fuel annually . While Federal was fighting for survival , it was being subjected to what it considered harassment by Executive Jet Aviation ( EJA ) , an Ohio-based air taxi operator . Through its chief executive officer , Washington attorney Bruce G. Sundlun , EJA complained to the Civil Aeronautics Board that General Dynamics had unlawfully gained control of Federal Express without the CAB 's approval . The charge was that General Dynamics ' guarantee of the $23.7 million loan by Chase Manhattan Bank on the 18 Falcons was a violation of Section 408 of the CAB 's economic regulations . EJA feared that Federal Express ? through its connection with General Dynamics ? had as its real purpose to get into the executive jet business , not the express mail package business as Federal claimed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ informed the CAB that it had kept the agency informed of the list of investors , and that it had complied with all of the CAB 's regulations . It emphasized the EJA 's demand for the divestiture of General Dynamics ' interest in Federal was a brazen attempt by one air taxi operator , EJA , to eliminate a potential competitor , Federal Express . General Dynamics in March , 1974 , held only 8.8 percent of the voting shares in Federal , while in September , 1974 , its total shares represented only a 4.9 percent interest in the venture . Petitions by Executive Jet Aviation and responses by Federal Express flew back and forth ; and , when CAB Docket No. 25953 was closed in March , 1979 , there had been 34 documents submitted to the CAB by the two parties . EJA 's action was considered pure harassment by Federal Express , but , in fact , it had not been harmed by EJA in any way . Cash flow continued to be the most serious problem in early 1974 . Accounts receivable were increasing inordinately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " that is to say the time lapse between the service rendered to the customer and the date payment was received , was 54 days ? an extraordinarily long time for a company desperately needing funds . Smith explained : " All the packages in the world are n't going to do us any good if we do n't get paid . Like most  | companies , we just wanted to get sales . We were n't spending much time tracking accounts . We did n't know exactly what was owed us . " Federal Express had solved the complex transportation logistics problems in moving a package overnight between Point A and Point B via Memphis , but it could not solve its paperwork problems . Some competitors seized the opportunity to discredit Federal Express by sending to air express shippers copies of uncomplimentary reports , or articles , which reported on Federal 's losses . Robert G. Brazier , president of Airborne Freight , circulated a memorandum which scornfully said : " Mr. Smith has an expensive toy in Federal Express . Let 's concentrate on Emery . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John Emery himself was generally complimentary . He said that , considering the declining service of the scheduled commercial airlines , Federal 's market timing was good . He could afford to be generous in 1974 since Emery Air Freight was the giant of the industry and therefore it did not worry too much about the small , infant company in Memphis . The January , 1974 , loss was some $12,000 more than the revenue taken in . The financial situation was not much different in February . Federal Express was practically out of money . It needed additional capital quickly . Package volume was growing , but not fast enough to provide any positive cash flow . Ultimately , the company would have to wait 17 more months before monthly revenues exceeded monthly expenses . Cash for payrolls was short , and some employees complained about the delays in receiving their payroll checks . A disgruntled courier in Kansas City to whom the company owed $300 held his station manager hostage one afternoon . The courier telephoned Memphis to talk with Mike Fitzgerald , head of field operations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blow his head off and shit in the hole , if you do n't pay me what you owe me . " After several hours of scrambling around trying to find someone in Memphis to find the funds , the money was dispatched to Kansas City to pay the courier . The company had one of its employees act as an ombudsman and his assignment was to stall off creditors , or dole out partial payments . " Checks were bouncing all over the country , " chuckled Fitzgerald . On February 12 , 1974 , there was a meeting of the venture capital group and lenders in Memphis to discuss the company 's critical need for more funds . Under the terms of the original November 13 , 1973 , credit agreement , the lenders held back funds desperately needed by Federal Express to operate . The company had fallen short of its committed objectives , package volume was less than projected , and expenses far outdistanced revenues . The participants agreed that a financial collapse could be avoided only if $6.4 million additional equity and an additional loan of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company .  | General Dynamics and two very minor initial venture capital participants refused to invest in the second round . " The failure of General Dynamics to come forth was caused by a little bit of several things , " says Charles Lea . " It had its own financial problems and it could n't see putting any more money into Federal Express . Also , there was the problem with Gorden MacDonald , General Dynamics ' finance guy and Fred Smith . Fred did n't know much about corporate finance , and he just did n't get on a common wave length with MacDonald . Fred was only 29 years old and did n't always get the best advice . Some of his ideas were off-the-wall and disconcerting to MacDonald . " A surprise event occurred on March 6th , just 13 days before the scheduled completion of the second round of financing . On that day in Memphis the Enterprise board was informed of the nature of Fred Smith 's $2 million loan in February , 1973 , from Union Bank in Little Rock . The one-year loan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ board citing the terms of the redemption agreement . That was the first time Enterprise had knowledge of Fred Smith 's loan . On March 11th at a meeting of the Enterprise board , Fred Smith admitted he had forged the documents . The Enterprise board not only agreed to expose Fred Smith 's falsification of the document ; but it also decided immediately to inform Union Bank of what had happened , as well as to tell the bank 's officers there was no redemption agreement . In the aftermath of this revelation , Fred Smith agreed to inform all of the participants scheduled to take part in the second round of financing about the misrepresentation . In his own defense , Smith wrote to Rick Stowe of New Court Securities the following day telling Stowe he expected to meet his financial obligations as they matured without impairing his ability to run Federal Express . Smith explained that he had been having a running battle with the Enterprise Company board on the matter of its further participation in , and support of , the Federal Express venture . The second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was vital to the company 's future . Federal Express had experienced in its brief life an operating loss of $5.5 million on revenues of $10.2 million . There was a real danger of imminent suspension of operations without these second round funds . Nightly package volume was increasing , but not fast enough . William J. Hewitt , then a partner with Cravath , Swaine and Moore , the Wall Street law firm representing the investors , summoned Fred Smith to New York . Hewitt was reported to be very upset at Smith about the Union Bank loan and because of the bitter complaints of Fredette and Laura about what Fred had done . The sisters had hired a Washington attorney , Robert Molloy , and according to Smith , he was threatening to throw a monkey wrench into the forthcoming second round of financing . Hewitt had a Dutch-uncle talk with Smith  | about the seriousness of the matter of the forged documents . Clearly , and with good reason , the lenders and the equity investors were very worried about what this might do to the future of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were on the line among those professionals who represented the participating financial groups . Their superiors could probably accuse them of ineptness for failure to do their homework handling the Federal Express matter . Financial institutions often deal very harshly with those they think have been negligent . If such men do not get fired , they are at least relegated to positions away from lending or investing money . On March 12th the investor and lender groups met in Chicago to discuss with an executive search firm a plan for hiring a new chief executive officer to run Federal Express . " Ironically , we met in the Icarus Room of the O'Hare Hilton , " an amused Rick Stowe told me . There is a sign outside the door of this meeting room which describes in summary form the fate of this character in Greek mythology , a character not unlike the threatened fate of Fred Smith : " By disobeying his father 's orders , Icarus flew too near the sun , with the result that the fastenings of his wings were melted , and he plunged to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pilot casualty . " The group debated whether Fred Smith should stay or whether he should be fired . They were extremely concerned that Smith 's financial problems might preoccupy him and conceivably make him unavailable to run the company . But most agreed the company was not endangered by his staying . After lengthy discussions , the majority in the room supported Smith 's continuance because they realized he had a real power base . That is to say they realized that to outsiders Smith was Federal Express . Equally important , he had the loyalty and dedication of his employees . Nonetheless , they were still concerned about the company because most of Smith 's key people were marketing specialists and because nobody there in Memphis knew how to run an airline . The general criteria for the search were established at that meeting . The banks were requesting a person be hired with broad general management experience , preferably with a background in airlines , trucking , hotel , or other service business . They wanted someone older than Fred Smith , who was then only 29 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been offered the job as chief financial officer . He accepted at the April , 1974 , board of directors meeting and agreed to report to Memphis on May 6th . The screening committee for finding a new chief executive officer was Brick Meers of White , Weld and Charley Lea of New Court . They agreed to interview candidates found by the search firm . They later found several prospects , including 59-year-old General Howell M. Estes , Jr . Estes had retired from the Air Force in 1969 after a distinguished career , and had taken the job as president of World Airways , a military and commercial charter airline based in Oakland ,  | California . " Estes was checked out very quickly by people at the Bank of America , and largely on the basis of this check we hired him , " Brick Meers answered when asked how the screening committee made its recommendation . The new equity of $6.4 million was represented by 64,000 shares of senior convertible preferred stock , with a conversion price of $29.34 per share . The agreement to grant $5.1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to issue the lenders warrants to purchase 236,190 shares of stock at a future date at a specified price , called the exercise price . As of March 19 , 1974 , the holder of the greatest number of voting shares was New Court Securities and its special accounts with almost 21 percent . Fred Smith had a 9.80 voting interest ; and the family Enterprise Company , 9.25 percent . The bank warrant holders had 9.26 percent ; and Citicorp 's venture capital subsidiary , the FNCB Capital Corporation , 9.24 percent . Smith and his family prior to November , 1973 , had outright control . On March 19 , 1974 , they held only a 19.05 percent voting share position . They had to give up a major portion of their ownership or risk losing everything . The strength of the various ownership interests may have looked academic to outsiders when informed of the loss of about $13.7 million for the fiscal year ending May 31 , 1974 . Business Week carried an uncomplimentary article in its June 15th issue titled : " Federal Express Takes A Nosedive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myriad of mistakes he felt the company had made , including its overly-optimistic volume projections and its inability to control costs . It was a stinging article with strong negative overtones insofar as its effects on the company 's marketing efforts in attracting new customers and retaining existing ones . Federal Express protested loudly that the influential Business Week had painted an inaccurate picture of conditions . The company agreed with some of the points but they objected to the " nosedive " conclusion . The company was developing national visibility . The question was : Would it survive the summer of 1974 ? Even though industrial shippers were highly complimentary of the service Federal was providing and the rates charged , it did not seem to be enough . On May 31 , 1974 , the company was in default on interest due on some $2.5 million in bank debt . The investors held an emergency meeting in Chicago on June 18 , 1974 , with General Estes to discuss the serious financial condition . Earnings were nonexistent , and there was no cash flow to pay off bank debt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raise funds to support the company 's 1975 Business Plan , but they also agreed an attempt should be made to secure more equity by July . Numerous potential venture capital groups were approached by Charley Lea and Rick Stowe of New  | Court , but the response was almost always the same . They either said they were not interested in new deals , or that the Federal Express venture had been very spotty up to this point and much too risky . Some questioned the ability of Federal 's new management to perform . It was September , 1974 , before the third round of financing could be completed . Investors put up another $3,876,000 represented by 1,550,400 shares of convertible subordinated notes . In mid-July , 1974 , General Estes and Peter Willmott met with Henry Crown in Chicago to ask his help , but Crown demurred . He told them that General Dynamics had urgent cash needs for its own projects . Be that as it may , General Dynamics did agree to put in a modest investment of $300,000 . The recalcitrant Ned Heizer refused to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lea and Fred Smith were not able to convince Heizer to stay in . In fact , during heated conversations Heizer is reported to have threatened to sue over the dilution factor . The heaviest investors in round three stood to gain substantial ownership of the company at the expense of the smaller , original investors . Heizer was under some strain from the burden on his private venture firm of its previous investments in Federal Express and its $9.2 million equity investment in Amdahl . Inside Federal Express and among some of the other investors there was a feeling that Heizer had stayed out of the third round in order to improve his equity position by later approaching Chase Manhattan Bank to try to purchase the Federal Express warrants held by the Chase . In the third round , 17 of the original 24 investors put up additional cash . No new investors were attracted , despite the hard canvassing which had been done among a good part of America 's venture capitalists . The conversion price on the 1,550,400 shares issued was $2.50 . It was very painful for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . New Court Securities , which had invested just $973,000 in this round , received 369,200 shares . New Court and the accounts it represented now owned 16 percent of Federal Express ; Prudential owned 10.7 percent ; Fred Smith , just 8.5 percent ; and the family trust , the Enterprise Company , a meager 0.4 percent . New Court had put up 13.8 percent of the total equity . But Enterprise now had only a 0.4 percent interest despite contributing 11 percent of the total equity capital . Heizer also saw his position diluted . His group had put up 5 percent of the equity , and after round three his interest was down to 0.5 percent . The lenders held a 24.8 percent interest . The warrants that had been issued to them represented rights to 669,666 shares of the total of 1,704,562 shares issued or issuable through September , 1974 . Chase Manhattan , the First National Bank of Chicago , and the other participating banks in the Credit Agreement agreed to waive  | interest on their loans in September , but stipulated that Federal Express must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 , 1975 . Temporarily , Federal was off the hook with the banks , but later in 1976 and 1977 enormous pressure was placed by the banks ' lending officers to collect what was owed them . By that time the banks had lost patience with Fred Smith and his company . There were many bitter moments as the banks applied pressure on the company . It was in 1974 and 1975 that Chase Manhattan , the First National Bank of Chicago , and numerous other banking giants were faced with wholesale numbers of defaults on loans to real estate ventures , fast food franchises , and conglomerates made in the late 1960s and the early 1970s . Major banks were accused by analysts of making a lot of stupid loans during that period . Federal Express , throughout 1974 , and well into 1975 , was competitively vulnerable . Smith knew if Emery or Airborne were to have gone into aggressive direct competition with Federal for the priority small package market , the company would not have survived . Says Smith : " At that stage we could have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to react to Federal Express ' presence . Emery had done well historically in the business of handling general air cargo . It was the established air freight leader and highly regarded by Wall Street analysts . Its price/earnings ratio in the spring of 1974 was 26 to 1 . Federal raised its rates several times in 1974 to try to balance revenues with expenses . Still , it was far below the breakeven point through 1974 and into 1975 . The additional investment dollars were drained away quickly , and negative cash flows kept Federal on the endangered species list . The company was facing pressure from every direction . On a daily basis the company faced a multitude of creditors ranging from the City of Detroit to their own employees . Airport officials in Detroit parked a fire truck in front of a Falcon one day because Federal had not paid the landing fee . Couriers often used their credit cards to buy gasoline for their delivery vans and sought reimbursement from the company later . It took a lot of loyalty to be a courier in those days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Peter S. Willmott ( B.A. , Williams ; MBA , Harvard ) came to Federal Express in May from a position as treasurer of the Continental Baking Company . He had at one time been a management consultant with Booz , Allen &; Hamilton and an analyst for American Airlines . The tall , serious-looking Willmott wanted an entrepreneurial opportunity , and at 37 he felt Federal Express was his chance . What Willmott found in Memphis was a chaotic financial administrative mess . " Pete saw a bunch of guys running around seemingly not knowing what to do , " says Lea . " He did n't come down hard on anybody because he understood the situation . His job was to straighten out the numbers so we could find out where we stood  | financially . " Brick Meers had been trying for months prior to Willmott 's arrival to get a clean audit prepared to present to the lenders . As chairman of Federal 's Audit Committee he also wanted to get the company straightened out before an audit by one of the " Big Eight " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not appear in such a professional audit . It took Willmott about three months to get the financial numbers the investors could believe in . Contrary to the thinking of Smith and his senior staff , Willmott strongly recommended raising prices . He reasoned that if the company offered a quality service , customers would pay for it . He wanted to get revenues up quickly to close the gap on expenses . Willmott was a no-nonsense , conservative financial manager given a difficult assignment . Charley Lea told Federal 's investor group , " Peter Willmott , who comes from Glens Falls , New York , was n't always understood by people who came from Arkansas . Financial management is a long way from bean counting . " Lea 's flippant remark , alluding to the tradition where , in the saloons of the old West , beans were used as poker chips , was meant to draw a distinction between the reckless gamblers of Federal Express and the conservative money managers of the eastern-financial establishment . General Estes arrived in Memphis on June 1 , 1974 , to assume @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staff issued the statement that Fred Smith could not handle the task of raising investment funds and running the airline simultaneously , and that Smith had suggested Estes for the chief executive officer 's job . This was not the case . Since the March 12 meeting at the Icarus Room in Chicago 's O'Hare Hilton , the investors firmly indicated that they were looking for an older , operations-oriented executive with managerial experience either in airlines or a related type service industry . Smith was to remain , but only as Federal 's president . Later , when Lea was asked why Estes was picked , he explains , " We needed to give credibility to Federal Express and to give comfort to the lenders and investors . As it worked out , Estes detached himself from worrying about the deeper operational problems we were facing , and he was of limited help in the crucial financial planning side of the business . " General Estes was paid $75,000 as chief executive officer ; Smith , as president received $40,000 . " Throughout Estes ' nine-month stay at Federal Express @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " remembers Bill Arthur , one of Smith 's aides at the time . " Fred operated as if the General was n't there . Estes seemed to be so caught up in obtaining the perks of his position as chief executive officer , like insisting on a reserved parking spot for his fancy European model of a Mercedes or ordering a special brand of cigars , he did n't realize Fred was n't carrying out his suggestions . They never had any open disagreements . "  | Smith later characterized his relationship with General Estes as " Ho Chi Minh versus Bismarck . " Interestingly enough , in the course of this research , I found it nearly impossible to discover either photographic or biographical materials concerning Estes . Apparently , Estes has become a non-person as far as Federal Express is concerned . A crisis arose on January 21 , 1975 , and the arms-length relationship between the two ended . Fred Smith informed the board of directors of a federal grand jury investigation in Little Rock concerning the circumstances of his $2 million loan from Union Bank in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had contracted Federal authorities through their attorneys on the matter of his submitting forged documents pledging the credit of the familyowned Enterprise Company in which they held a major ownership position . Fred Smith told the board : " It is my opinion that the actions of my sisters were designed to discredit both myself and Federal Express in the hopes of influencing the civil action . " On Friday , January 31 , 1975 , Smith was formally indicted for obtaining funds from the Union Bank by use of false documents . And on Monday , February 3rd , a warrant was issued for his arrest . But this was only part of his trouble : late that same night he had been indicted , he hit and killed a pedestrian who was jaywalking . When apprehended , he claimed he did not realize he had hit anybody , and this was the reason he failed to stop . Smith was charged with leaving the scene of the accident as well as driving with an expired license . Fred Smith was in serious trouble . Worried that competitors would use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employees : " I do not want to burden you with my personal problems and want to stress this matter of the indictment has absolutely no bearing on Federal Express ' operations , but I ask your continuing support in confronting the publicity that may result from this action . An indictment is certainly no proof of guilt or innocence . " The next meeting of Federal 's board of directors was scheduled for Thursday , February 27 , 1975 . Tension had been building concerning Fred Smith 's future at Federal Express . The evening before the meeting , Charley Lea , who had arrived in Memphis from New York early , had a long discussion with Smith about Smith 's status with the company . Roger Frock and Mike Fitzgerald , two of Smith 's key senior officers , saw Smith later that evening in his office before going home . They remember that Smith did not mention anything to them about resigning . But Fitzgerald recalls that as he was getting ready to go to bed he got a call from Roger Frock to tell him Smith had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at 10:00 a.m. when Federal 's board convened . They both knew Smith was still at the office , so they decided to go back to the office to try to talk him out of it . According to Fitzgerald they " talked for hours . " Early the next morning Fitzgerald went to the Memphis Hilton to  | talk with Charley Lea . In a heated discussion Fitzgerald announced that if Fred Smith were to be fired , he , Roger Frock , and Art Bass would resign , and in all likelihood Federal Express would cease operations the following Monday morning because of a mass walkout . Lea remembers : " This was real soap opera stuff . The board had a potential mutiny on its hands , and it was totally unexpected . " The board convened just after 10:00 a.m . General Estes , like several others , tried to convince the rest of the board Smith should go . Then , Art Bass asked if he could address the board . In an impassioned plea Bass said : " Fred Smith is our spiritual leader , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . He has given Federal Express total dedication . He has put everything on the line . " And he told the board to expect the resignation of Smith 's key officers if Smith were fired . This threat of a mass resignation of the principal company officers threw the board in turmoil . They knew they were facing a palace revolt so the meeting was adjourned until 4:00 p.m. to give the board leadership time to plan a strategy . The possibility of these resignations was sobering to Meers and Lea and the other board members representing the principal investors . If the company ceased operations , all the time and money they had put into Federal Express would be lost . A lot of professional careers of these board members were at stake ; heads would roll if they were the cause of the company 's failure . As a result of this crisis , the board immediately designated a special Ad Hoc Committee on Management and Organization to be made up of board members ? Philip Greer , Larry Lawrence , Charley Lea , Gorden MacDonald , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Ad Hoc Committee to meet . Brick Meers , Charley Lea and Fred Smith adjourned to a side room for a long " give-and-take " discussion . " We talked straight with Fred about the situation , and he told us what was on his mind , " said Brick Meers . Afterwards Smith left to talk with his senior officers who had been meeting on their own in another room , while Meers and Lea met privately with General Estes for the same type of " give-and-take " discussion they had had with Fred Smith . It was a rough day for Meers and Lea trying to sort out the conflict . At 4:00 p.m. when the full board reconvened there was a surprise announcement . The board accepted with regret the resignation of General Estes , offering him an option to buy 242,249 shares of Class A common stock at an exercise price of $1 million . The option was in effect between August 1 , 1976 , and July 31 , 1977 , but as it turned out Estes did n't exercise it . With the departure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as president and acting chief operating officer , and Fred Smith was appointed to replace Estes as chairman of the board . At the same time the executive committee of the board , with Charley Lea as the chairman , was selected  | to oversee all major policy decisions while it undertook a search for a new CEO . Smith was requested to work very closely with the executive committee in future policy matters . No public announcement was made by the company that some power had been taken away from Smith . As far as the public and the rank-and-file of Federal 's employees knew Fred Smith was the new chairman of the board . It was supposed to seem as though this was an obvious enhancement of Smith 's stature as founder and " guiding light " of Federal Express . General Estes cleaned out his desk the next morning , and quietly left exactly nine months after his arrival in Memphis . Charley Lea , in summarizing the bizarre turn of events , told the lenders a year later : " We did a strange thing . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the founder to the title of chairman ; appointed a relatively untried executive to the post of president and chief operating officer ; and retained for itself a small committee with no special credentials to function as the executive . The beauty of these profound changes was that the situation permitted no alternative choices at the time . The efficacy of these changes was apparent to no one . " This strange episode is reminiscent of the sign on the old western saloon door : " Please do n't shoot the piano player , he 's the only one we 've got . " Fred Smith 's charmed life had allowed him to escape once again , or at least for a while . The company was still in deep financial trouble in spring , 1975 . For the fiscal year ending May 31 , 1975 , the loss was $11.5 million . This made the cumulative loss for the first 26 months of operation over $29.3 million , and in addition , it owed its lenders over $49 million . One wonders how many other companies in this predicament would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modification subsidiary , was liquidated in 1975 after three years of continuous operating losses totaling about $1 million . It was not exactly a rosy picture Federal Express was giving the investment world , or its concerned creditors . Understandably , two articles in the influential business weekly Barron 's in mid-1975 questioned whether Federal Express had the ability to survive . The respected Alan Abelson referred to it as " a spunky company , " but he expressed reservations about its chances of success . A serious problem arose in late May , 1975 , when CCEC , the lender on ten of the Falcons in Federal 's fleet , was showing reluctance to waive the loan default due to occur on May 31 , 1975 . Federal 's management was summoned to CCEC 's headquarters in Baltimore for a meeting on May 28th to discuss the problem . John Sheehan , president and CEO , strode into the meeting room to meet with Art Bass , Peter Willmott , and Charley Lea . He asked Art Bass what he did at Federal Express , and Bass told him he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sheehan asked him  | what he did . Willmott replied he was senior vice president of finance and administration . But before he could get to Lea , one of his aides interrupted him . Later Lea recalled : " Look , if Sheehan had asked me what I did , it probably would have been all over for Federal Express . You see , I was a member of the Executive Committee of the board of directors , and we had stripped Fred Smith of policy control in the aftermath of the federal indictment earlier that year and the reorganization that pushed Howell Estes out . We were running the company . " Sheehan expressed amazement at how old the Falcons were which CCEC had been financing . Bass told Sheehan that if CCEC were to repossess these aircraft , it would cost a great deal of money to reconvert the Falcons from cargo aircraft back to their original passenger configurations . But more to the point , it was explained to Sheehan that at that time there was practically no market for Falcons . Then , Sheehan turned his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fiscal 1976 Business Plan . He responded with disbelief : " You are still telling us the same optimistic story about Federal 's achieving its corporate business plan you told us in 1974 . " Later , after further discussion , Sheehan told Bass , Willmott , and Lea : " In the light of Federal 's new management we will give the company a couple of months . " Once more Federal Express got yet another reprieve . If CCEC had seized the ten Falcons , in all likelihood the company would have ceased operations soon thereafter . A key issue within the company at that time was recapitalization . How and when should Federal Express restructure itself to lift the onerous debt burden off its back ? All agreed the company 's present capitalization was extremely unwieldy owing to the hodge-podge of different types of securities , and it was imperative steps be taken to make Federal Express more attractive to potential equity investors . The initial target date for holding a public offering was before the end of 1975 . There were problems , however . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gain the cooperation of the bank lenders who held 628,244 of the total of 669,666 warrants outstanding . Both Federal 's board and management felt it was critical that no third party like Ned Heizer or someone else be permitted to gain control of any of these bank warrants by going directly to the banks with an offer to purchase . If recapitalization were to be successful , Federal Express would have to gain control of the majority of them . In June , 1975 , the board agreed to proceed with preliminary steps toward a public equity financing . Members of the board told the company 's staff that the necessary condition for a successful recapitalization would be three or four months of profitable operations . Up to that point the company had failed to break even for any prior monthly period . The first profitable month finally came in July , 1975 , when the company netted $55,000 . This was the start of what turned out to be the first profitable fiscal year and , when it  | ended on May 31 , 1976 , the net income @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , was restructuring the debt to lighten the burden on the company while it tried to build its cash flow . Federal requested $5 million in principal deferrals in its 1976 Business Plan so it could expand on its quest for profits . If the banks were unwilling to reshape the loan repayment schedule , then the company might fail before the end of that year . Fred Smith 's future role at Federal Express was also an issue with both the lender and investor groups . Federal 's board in fall , 1975 , undertook a search for a new CEO . On December 4 , 1975 , less than a week before Fred Smith went on trial in federal court on the forgery charge , an offer was made to G. Michael Hostage , then a vice president of the Marriott Corporation . Inexplicably Hostage turned them down despite a lucrative offer . Perhaps the waters seemed too rough at Federal Express for a new CEO . At the trial held in Little Rock , Smith 's defense was based on the theme , " I am Frederick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Burch , Jr. , a highly experienced Memphis-based trial lawyer with a long record of major victories in tough courtroom battles . Burch had Smith elaborate extensively on his Marine Corps combat experience in Vietnam and on his development of the concept which led ultimately to the formation of Federal Express . In justifying his actions in regard to the Union Bank loan , Smith testified : " Almost 50 percent of the Enterprise Company is Fred Smith , either personally or in trust for me . And I felt at the time that I was the Enterprise Company . It 's as simple as that . And I felt that both of the sisters felt the same way . Both of them had written letters to the bankers that sat on the board saying , We support Fred Smith in whatever he wants to do . ' Smith told the court that , at the time of the Union Bank loan in February , 1973 , he felt Enterprise Company would ratify the resolution he had prepared if called upon to do so . After all , he was president @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had the authority to commit the board . On December 11 , 1975 , after ten hours of deliberation , the federal jury acquitted him . The heavy strain on Smith personally and the cloud the forgery charge had placed over the company were removed . If he had been convicted he could have faced up to a five year prison term . Federal Express employees had remained loyal throughout . They thought all along it was a trumped-up charge . Characterizing the mood of those times one aide close to Fred Smith remembered , " We all felt those greedy Little Rock banks knew perfectly well what was happening when Smith borrowed the money . They pushed loans on him ; then because of pressure from Robert Molloy , the aggressive lawyer hired by Fred 's sisters , they got loosey-goosey. "  | Earlier Fredette and Laura , Fred 's sisters , had brought action in the Chancery Court of Shelby County , Tennessee , against their brother , the National Bank of Commerce of Memphis , certain of the banks ' officers , and the Enterprise Company . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $6,250,000 in Federal Express , alleging violations of the " prudent man " rule and other fiduciary principles . They sought to restore assets of Enterprise Company to the $17 million level which was the worth of its assets prior to the investments in Federal Express . It was their estimate that the Enterprise Company was now worth only $2.5 million . Finally , four years after the original filing , an out-of-court settlement was reached in December , 1978 . Fred Smith agreed to buy out his sisters ' stock in Enterprise and guaranteed to make complete restitution for any loss in value to this trust . With the Federal trial behind him , Smith in early 1976 turned his attention to pushing the lenders to reshape the loan payment schedule and to try to recapture the warrants held by the lenders in order to reduce this overhang on the company . Each warrant gave the holder the right to purchase one share of Class A common stock . Considerable effort was made by Federal 's management in the spring of 1976 to get the bank lenders to consent to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1973 , and amended in March , 1974 . The company requested that the banks agree to a debt amortization schedule some $5.5 million less than the $9.5 million called for in fiscal 1977 by the terms of the credit agreement . Brick Meers , who was observing all of this conflict , remembers : " There was bad blood all around on this issue . A loan officer of the First National Bank of Chicago had brought up the fact that Federal 's March , 1976 , figures were much worse for the company than expected and that margins were down . The loan officer was quite concerned about Federal 's future . " His unyielding attitude angered Smith and he said he would never again do business with the First National Bank of Chicago . Later , however , Smith and the bank forgot their differences at the time of the 1978 recapitalization when Federal Express went public and its financial future brightened . At the height of Smith 's bitter fight with the bank lenders in early 1976 , Federal 's management and board of directors held exploratory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it might want to take over despite Federal 's serious financial problems . Later , after considerable research , Purolator concluded the acquisition was not a good corporate fit and dropped further discussions . The issue of the bank warrants , and how Federal Express could get the warrants back from the lenders , occupied Federal 's management and board throughout much of 1976 . Chase Manhattan declined the company 's request to surrender its warrants which would  | have allowed Federal Express to proceed with plans for a recapitalization and a public offering . Smith questioned the legitimacy of the bank holding the warrants in the first place . He believed that the banks had obligated themselves to return the warrants on a reasonable basis . " Greed seemed to get the better of them when they decided to renege on this deal , " grumbled Smith . " If pressed , this issue could be litigated and be won . They took the warrants to allow a fourth financing had it been necessary ? not as an equity kicker ' and there were too many participants to ultimately deny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were to exercise their warrants , they would be in violation of the Glass-Steagall Act , the law governing national banks . Counsel for the First National Bank of Chicago later did indeed advise his bank that the Act would prohibit it from exercising the warrants . In June , 1976 , Smith called on his friend David S. Lewis , chairman of General Dynamics , asking for help in purchasing and exercising these warrants . He requested that General Dynamics agree to be guarantor on a $3 million , two-year loan . Smith said he needed $700,000 to purchase the warrants , another $1.7 million to exercise the warrants , and another $600,000 to pay off the loans he had personally guaranteed for the company . If he could get these warrants and exercise them , this would give him at least a 25 percent ownership position . He maintained he had the right of first refusal on these warrants if the banks attempted to sell them , and that it was urgent he be able to purchase them . He maintained he had been granted this right to regain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a concession granted him as a result of what the three rounds of financing in 1973 and 1974 had done to his ownership position . His interest had declined to a meager 8.5 percent as a result of being forced to make concessions to attract desperately needed additional capital to survive in those years . The squabbling among the lenders and the venture capital group over the issue of the warrants had been upsetting to Smith . In frustration he charged : " There are too many fingers in the pie , and too many misunderstandings . Neither group is focusing on the only real issue ? the future of the company . This is absolutely tragic . " In anticipation that he might be unable to purchase the warrants , Smith , in a surprise move in early June , 1976 , asked Henry Crown and David Lewis to consider him for a management position with either General Dynamics or Trans World Airways . This was a real turn of events because Fred , Fredette , and Laura still had a substantial sum of money tied up in Federal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had been flying back and forth from Memphis to Washington trying frantically to get relief from the Civil Aeronautics Board regulations so Federal could fly on its major routes aircraft with payloads substantially larger than the Falcons .  | In 1976 , Fred Smith was on good terms with neither the lenders nor the venture capitalist group . The contemptuous expression company senior officers used to describe them during this period was " the Jackals of Wall Street " because jackals hunt in packs at night feeding on smaller prey . Says Lea , " It was an us ' versus them ' mentality . " Smith and his inner circle of advisors did not always agree with what was happening in the apportionment of ownership shares in the second and third rounds of financing in 1974 . They felt the venture capital groups overreached themselves in gaining greater control of the company , particularly in the third round . And they resented the lenders ' position . They felt the " jackals " were still at work on behalf of their own selfish interests . At a meeting of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1976 , Brick Meers and Charley Lea discussed the open confrontation which had occurred between Smith and the banks and expressed regret that this conflict had occurred at a time when the future of Federal Express looked bright . They told the group that , unfortunately , the bank 's plan calling for a 70 percent warrant recapture from the banks ? a substantial equity " give-up " on the part of the present equity holders in favor of their acceptance of subordinated notes and becoming preferred stockholders to permit a possible $12 to $15 million public offering of common stock ? had been cast aside by the banks as a frivolous gesture . The banks did not feel the proposal dealt properly with their interests . Meers and Lea pleaded for goodwill . " Huge sums had been invested , " Lea continued , " and many of the investors had seen their equity wiped out . " Lea cautioned the banks that if they accelerated their loans , Federal Express would be forced to take the issue to the courts and the company would probably win . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' consideration , Lea said , " If Federal Express goes under , whatever accolades you may win within your institution will soon be lost in public opprobrium , for you must be aware such events become front page news in the financial press and the fable of David and Goliath seems to have been plagiarized by every reporter writing today . " Negotiations continued through 1976 with Smith and his management standing firm in their resolve to acquire the warrants held by the lenders . Smith was unable to get a loan from General Dynamics , and he continued seeking a co-maker on a $3 million loan a Memphis bank had committed to make so he could attempt to purchase the warrants . He had no luck at all that year . But he continued to speak out loudly of his right of first refusal on the warrants , and declined to compromise his position . He reminded the lenders that the Smith family had put over $8 million into Federal Express , and as of 1976 he held only an 8.5 percent interest , and the familyowned Enterprise Company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through 1976 and 1977.  | Fred Smith suggested at one point , when he was thinking of quitting , that the company create an ESOP ? an Employees Stock Ownership Plan ? as a means of raising additional capital , while at the same time keeping the company privately-owned . Such a financing vehicle would give Smith 's loyal employees " a piece-of-the-action " in Federal Express . Brick Meers felt Smith was getting poor advice , and strongly urged that the only way to make Smith " whole " was through a public offering of stock . This , Meers advised Smith , would enable Smith to bail himself out by giving him collateral , and Federal Express public value and borrowing value . No action resolving the complex financing issues was made until after the action by Congress in November , 1977 , when it passed the Air Cargo Deregulation Act , permitting Federal Express and other similar air taxi operators to fly larger aircraft . Deregulation brought the banks around . These banks viewed Federal Express differently for the first time since they had made the original loans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attitude of all of the parties . White , Weld and New Court Securities were authorized to undertake a public offering . The recapitalization , after three long years in the discussion stage , took place on April 12 , 1978 . Federal Express sold 783,000 shares at $24 per share , and raised $17,539,200 in new equity . Selling stockholders sold 292,000 shares for $6,540,800 . To activate the recapitalization , the warrant holders agreed to sell for $5.25 per underlying share a total of 444,641 shares having an exercise price of $2.50 per share . For a payment made to Smith by Federal Express of $200,000 , he waived his right of first refusal to purchase warrants for 200,000 shares . These warrants were purchased by the company for $5.25 per share . Smith bought the remaining 244,641 shares , also for $5.25 per share . The warrant holders also accounted for 183,603 of the 292,000 shares sold at the public offering by the selling stockholder group . Federal Express guaranteed a loan of $4.7 million made by the First National Bank of Chicago to Fred Smith . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first year 's interest on this loan ; and $2,934,000 to pay off his outstanding bank loans and his other creditors . The April , 1978 , sale of common stock reduced the oppressive debt burden and increased the company 's net worth . The balance sheet had never looked better , and those loyal Federal Express employees who had stuck with Smith throughout his countless close calls with disaster were given the opportunity to purchase 220,000 shares at a slightly discounted price . They leaped at the opportunity : 56 percent of Federal 's employees placed orders for 635,000 shares . Because of this oversubscription , individual orders had to be reduced to fit within the 220,000 share allocation for  | employees . After the recapitalization the ownership structure was : company officers and directors , 19 percent ; the initial venture capital investors , 49 percent ; and the general public , including Federal Express employees , 32 percent . Fred Smith , age 33 , had been through crisis after crisis since June , 1971 , when he incorporated Federal Express . The " Arkansas bean counters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by some Wall Street wags , had defied the dire predictions on the company 's lifespan and outwitted a lot of hard bitten , so-called " old pros " in the financial community . Some had attempted to take advantage of Fred Smith , but he had turned the tables on them . And , after-the-fact , they admired him for it . He had played rougher and shown more determination than they had . His unorthodox tactics may have been learned in part from Ho Chi Minh , the fearless old Vietnamese leader whom Smith admired , and in part from the " kill-or-be-killed " lessons learned during his Marine Corps career in the battle zones of Vietnam . He had walked continually on the edge of disaster and survived .  | By mid-1975 two or more flights per night were required to serve Boston , New York , Newark , Philadelphia , Chicago , Los Angeles and San Francisco . " Falcons are flying wingtip-to wingtip over the same lanes at approximately the same hours at night , " worried Art Bass , " and this is holding back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our largest markets . " Costs of operating the Falcon fleet were increasing month-by-month . Fuel costs represented 15 percent of the company 's total variable costs and were expected to escalate rapidly . An individual Falcon used 366 gallons of fuel per hour at a burning cost of $140.09 per hour in 1975 . The company estimated the burn cost for 1976 would be $156.51 per hour . This was another compelling reason for Federal Express to gain approval from the Civil Aeronautics Board to fly larger , more fuel efficient , aircraft to complement the Falcon fleet . Fred Smith went before the Federal Express board of directors in June , 1975 , and presented a plan to lease five Douglas DC-9s . His message was hopeful and optimistic as always . As a result of a changing attitude among many legislators toward regulation and even within President Ford 's Administration , he felt the CAB might approve the company 's request to fly the larger DC-9s on certain major routes to alleviate the nightly lift problems . Smith expected favorable consideration by the CAB if the company applied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 26 , 1975 , Federal Express  | filed an application with the CAB seeking relief from what Federal Express termed its " critical lift capacity problems . " The company requested this relief be granted by exemption from the 7,500 pound limit of Part 298 , rather than through issuance of a " Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity . " This process would ordinarily require a very long and drawn out administrative hearing procedure before the CAB could render a decision . The heart of Federal 's petition was a request for quick relief from the " critical lift " problem by being permitted to fly five DC-9-15 cargo planes , each with a payload of between 14,000 and 20,000 pounds , on five routes . Federal Express requested an answer by December 1 , 1975 . Federal Express argued that its market penetration was so slight and its service so specialized that such an exemption would not seriously affect any of the certificated carriers . Federal 's opponents instantly jumped on this application when filed , arguing that not only had Federal Express grown because it had been exploiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CAB 's control on the matter of flight routes and rates charged , but also that Federal Express could not have reached its present level of growth without this loophole . The worst indictment was that Federal Express was a cutthroat competitor engaged in predatory , below-cost pricing of its services . When challenged by his critics about the aggressive tactics used by Federal Express to build volume , Smith 's rebuttal insisted that the company 's business was expanding because it was penetrating a vast market which had not previously shipped by air . " Sure , " retorted the self-confident Smith , " we took some customers away from Emery , Airborne , and the scheduled carriers like American , Delta , and Eastern . We were offering a better service . " Countering the objections of the Air Freight Forwarders Association , Smith observed that Federal Express was providing reliable overnight express service in many off-line markets not easily reached by air freight forwarders because of their heavy reliance on scheduled airlines for nightly lift . It was no coincidence , then , that every scheduled airline objected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United Airlines . United was not much concerned about Federal Express because United was in favor of general airline deregulation as it anticipated greater competition would be the result . United saw deregulation as an opportunity for it to out-compete the scheduled airline industry and to earn a better return on its investment . The influential Air Transport Association ( also known as the ATA ) , a Washingtonbased lobbying group for the scheduled airlines , spearheaded the opposition , an opposition in which Delta and American Airlines were among the most vocal . On December 8 , 1975 , the company was dealt a severe blow when the order came down from the CAB denying the Federal  | Express request for relief . In denying the request to fly larger aircraft , the Board asserted that the exemption authority in section 416(b) of the Federal Aviation Act was not broad enough to permit it to consider the question of the use of larger aircraft . As a consequence , the CAB 's exemption powers were limited to inconsequential air transportation matters . The CAB had been blocked by an outdated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a limitation which prevented Federal 's relief , a limitation only legislative action could reverse . The CAB told Federal Express the authority it requested was more appropriately a matter for examination under the normal certification procedures of section 401 of the Act . It concluded that Federal 's past growth record and its projected growth were proper justification for it to go through the normal certification process . It would be happy to receive a request for certification , the Board said . Federal Express was clearly in a predicament , and it petitioned the CAB for reconsideration . Strains on company operations from surges in nightly package volume were already apparent even at the end of 1975 . REA Express , one of its competitors , after struggling for several years , collapsed in November , and in December the United Airlines strike pushed Federal Express to the limits in handling new business generated from shippers unable to use United . By 1976 , it had gained the dominant position in the small shipment air express market . In total priority air shipments under 100 pounds , Federal Express @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Airborne , 5 percent . In Federal 's fiscal 1976 Business Plan , its planners wrote that their goal was " to achieve a leadership role in the air freight industry . " In terms of the growing nightly package volume , this goal already appeared to be a reality : yet financially , Federal Express was still struggling to survive . These same planners calculated that the projected package volume would probably exceed the system 's capacity in the spring , 1978 . And by the time of the CAB rejection this capacity limit was just over two years away . It seemed clear that without larger jet aircraft the company 's future growth would be limited . It was a problem which would restrict the number of new markets opened . The task of analyzing the capacity needs , and matching anticipated demand with the space availability on the Falcons , consumed an inordinate amount of time of the company 's technical planning staff . Federal 's West Coast service was one of the most pressing of these logistical problems . In order to get the packages to Memphis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commitments , Falcons had to take off just an hour or so after the close of the business day in Los Angeles , San Francisco , Oakland , Portland , and Seattle . The resulting earlier customer pickup , and the consequent loss of potential business in the time period from 5:00 or 5:30 p.m.  | and 8:00 p.m. would be considerable . The limited lift of the Falcons precluded the carrying of heavier , consolidated shipments and of offering customers special pricing for bulk shipments . If the company had larger aircraft , these additional services could create another opportunity for a strong profit center . Until a permanent solution could be found in 1976 and 1977 , the corporate planners turned their attention to improving the nightly match-ups of the 32 Falcons and the often unreliable smaller supplemental fleet of " wet-leased " DC-3s , Lear Jets , and Twin Beeches to the disparate geographic markets in the Federal Express system . In addition to these difficulties , one Falcon had been wrecked in a crash on the ground in Rhode Island , so there were fewer aircraft to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with non-Federal Express crews and maintenance and were , as a consequence , a ragtag assortment of equipment . Competition in the air express business in 1976 was preventing desperately needed price increases and this lid on rates was pressuring the company 's profitability . Enhancing productivity became an absolute necessity to keep operating margins growing . As part of the effort to increase efficiency Smith considered the costs and benefits of moving the sorting hub out of Memphis to a site a few hundred miles northeast in order to help save fuel and to permit greater utilization of the planes . " We want to get closer to the market , " Smith concluded . " It 's a matter of economics . " Several logistical solutions were studied . Pittsburgh served temporarily as a mini-hub to " bleed off " some of the East Coast intra-regional shipments during this emergency period . " We did some excellent planning during the crisis years , " says the then head of special projects , Ted Weise . " We considered the best case ' and the worst case ' environment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if regulatory relief was granted or in case it was not . It was a series of what if ' exercises using computer simulation models . And we worried a lot , too . " While these studies were underway , Fred Smith began the campaign to obtain regulatory relief . From the spring , 1976 , until the fall , 1977 , he spent considerable time in Washington briefing himself on the laws governing commercial aviation , working closely with Washington-based regulatory counsel , Nathaniel P. Breed , Jr. , lobbying government officials and legislators , and testifying on seven different occasions before Congressional committees examining the issue of regulatory reform of aviation . Because he was considered by the business media as bright , articulate , and very quotable , Smith was asked to give many interviews during this period . He told one reporter : " If ever there was a case where the government is cheating somebody ? not by commission but by omission ? this is it . " To another he lectured : " The government does n't have to give us a thing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our way . " His preparation on the background of the CAB and the history of the Civil Aeronautics Act of 1938 , impressed several of the Congressmen who listened to his testimony at many hearings during his 18-month Washington ordeal . He believed that passenger travel had always been the primary focus of CAB regulations and that air cargo transportation needs had been sadly neglected . " When the original Act was passed , " Smith conjectured , " there was no economic incentive to carry property by air . Radioactive isotopes were unheard of . But society and industry have changed . The values of items shipped today are far different than they were 40 years ago . What we have is an anachronistic regulatory framework . " Smith attacked the scheduled airlines for not fully exploiting what he called " the quantum leaps in technology . " One failure was their inability to utilize the full potential of the widebodied jet , while another was their failure to accommodate competition . At a symposium concerning the status of the transportation industry he told his audience : " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreign power , but from the captains of industry whose competitive spirit does not extend to prospective competitors . " He took a similar message all over the United States at speaking engagements his public relations advisors had lined up for him . He repeated the message that the scheduled airlines " came off as whining fat cats interested only in preserving the status quo with the appearance of a public be damned ' attitude . " Delta Airlines was one of the major thorns in Federal 's side . Delta 's position throughout the period of Federal 's fight for regulatory relief was that there was nothing the matter with the present law and it did not need to be changed . American and Eastern also vigorously opposed any change in the traditional system of regulation , charging that those who questioned the regulatory structure were well-meaning but unknowledgeable critics . Smith blamed the CAB 's denial of the company 's application to fly the five DC-9s directly on the airlines . Smith charged : " When we applied to the CAB for an exemption , lo and behold , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Attila the Hun coming to the frontier , if you grant this exemption to Federal Express . It would be the end of air transportation as we know it . They really wanted to scuttle us . " Smith maintained the CAB had consistently denied exemption requests when the certificated carriers opposed them . The CAB was accused by Federal Express of neglecting the air cargo industry and its problems , and devoting most of its time to the air passenger business . In its report to the CAB , Federal wrote : " With this scenario , Federal Express is almost an unwelcome , or , at the very least , an unfamiliar intruder . " Federal Express ' entry on the Washington scene was excellent as far as timing was concerned . The issue of deregulation was finally  | peaking after nearly two decades of general discussion by at least three presidential administrations , several CAB board chairman , and many prominent academicians who had examined the government regulatory structure , In addition , there was mounting concern by critics of the Federal Aviation Act that it was stifling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hiding the entrenched commercial airlines industry . The consensus was that the regulatory system w - as obsolete and that it was protecting the inefficient carriers . Be " that as it may , the emphasis of these attacks was always on reform o% the passenger side of the air transportation industry . Air cargo was seldom mentioned . The DG ? ' cember , 1975 , CAB rejection of Federal 's request for exemption to fly larger aircraft caused some turmoil in the early months Of 1976 , among Federal 's management and its board of directors . Not only was there the threat of reaching the physical limits of growth sometime within the next two years , but also there was the elimination of any possibility for a recapitalization for the company . Federal Express desperately needed this recapitalization to improve its balance sheet , but it could not realistically take place so long a , s the Falcons , or any other small jet aircraft meeting the payload r equirements of Part 298 of the CAB 's regulations , remained the prima - 'Y operating equipment . In the months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dejection as Smith and the board of directors attempted to figure out a strategy . Those familiar with the operations of the Washington political scene advised Federal Express , " Go to Capitol Hill and get your Tennessee Congressional delegation working for you . Stay away from the CAB . The Board 's business is to say No . ' " Calling on its Tennessee senatorial delegation proved to be good advice . Howard Baker was Senate Minority Leader in 1976 , and Senator William Brock was a respected legislator . Federal Express was also advised to retain experienced Washington legislative counsel and Congressional lobbyists to help sell its case . Gary Burhop , who at the time was Senator 8rock 's chief administrative aide , was later to remember : " The Federal Express people showed their inexperience in maneuvering in Washington in early 1976 . If they had n't been advised otherwise , I really think they would have picked their Washington consultants frontal the Yellow Pages . " The quandry facing Federal Express was whether it should play the " establishment game " and seek CAB certification knowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it should seek immediate legislative relief . To represent the company in the Washington regulatory arenas , Smith retained as special aviation counsel , Nat Breed . Breed had been a former CAB attorney and later an attorney with a Washington law firm which represented Delta Airlines . At the same time , the Federal Express investor group retained another Washington attorney ? who also represented the legislative  | interests of General Dynamics in Washington ? Lee Hydeman , as special counsel to them . At the board of directors meeting at Federal Express on January 13 , 1976 , the various options available to the company were reviewed and confusion seemed omnipresent . Primarily , the discussion was directed to the question of the pitfalls of the certification process . Hydeman , described as a hardnosed , outspoken individual , believed this process could take a minimum of two years and possibly as long as six years . He also thought the hearing and decision process might be dragged out even longer if there were competing applications filed , such as one from Flying Tigers . Also the group discussed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CAB , might restrict Federal 's market freedom to select its nightly route patterns and the prices it could charge for its different services . There was also the concern that during the course of the CAB certification process Federal 's growth might be seriously restrained if it were denied the opportunity to fly the larger Douglas DC-9s or Boeing 727s during that time period . The issue dragged on throughout most of 1976 , although it was not debated in detail again until after October 2 , 1976 , when the bill which would have granted Federal Express relief died in a House committee . Fred Smith made his first appearance before a Congressional committee in April , 1976 , to testify before the Senate 's Subcommittee on Aviation of the Committee on Commerce which was looking into the question of regulatory reform in air transportation . This was Smith 's first encounter with Senator Howard Cannon of Nevada , the subcommittee 's chairman . His state did not have particularly good air cargo service , and Federal Express was able to make a strong case with shippers in Nevada @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such service were available . Smith told Cannon 's Subcommittee why the airlines collectively opposed Federal 's CAB request to fly the DC-9s : " They think they are entitled to the traffic regardless of whether they provide as good a service or as cheap a rate ; and second , that they were there first with the mostest and consequently it is their business , and I think that is a very unhealthy attitude . " It must have seemed odd to see the then 31-year-old Fred Smith , attacking not only the established scheduled airlines but also the CAB with a skillfully prepared presentation . It was almost as if he had been involved with the commercial aviation industry a quarter of a century rather than only three years . Smith 's good humored but brash articulation of his case brought much needed attention to this aggressive , small package airline . Smith 's second Congressional appearance came several weeks later when he appeared before the House Subcommitee on Aviation chaired by Glenn Anderson of California . At this hearing Smith made clear the inherent differences between people and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not recognize air cargo for what it is . His nemesis , the scheduled airlines , again came under Smith 's attack . When asked why Federal Express did not use the bellies of the airlines to handle packages , Smith identified two reasons : first , the lack of carrier service at night ; and secondly , the lack of ability to solve the problem of transporting restricted emergency items . To illustrate his point , Smith shared his recent conversation with the president of New England Nuclear Corporation , a supplier of nuclear generators used in hospitals to save lives : President , New England Nuclear : " I will go down and testify before the CAB that we have two choices . We can either use Federal Express to ship these nuclear medicines out , or they can bring the patient to us , you know , in a wheelchair . " Smith : " No , we should not do that , because American Airlines would call that a diversion . We could not bring the patient in on that sort of thing . " Again , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eloquent college professor explaining to his class ? the Subcommittee in this case ? the serious omissions of the Civil Aeronautics Act of 1938 , and the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 , as amended , insofar as the air cargo industry was concerned . He demonstrated that the law was heavily oriented toward passenger regulation dating from the 1938 legislation . And , as he had done at all of his seven Congressional appearances , he hammered away at the theme that passenger and cargo services were vastly different businesses with different characteristics . Air cargo , Smith argued , was an industry stifled by economic regulation . Federal Express was seeking legislative relief from the rigid limitations of section 416(b) as a remedy to its problem of not being able to fly larger aircraft . Chairman Anderson questioned Smith about this strategy : Mr. Anderson : " You testify that you fear that a CAB case would take 2 to 10 years to complete . Would you please explain why the time factor led you to a decision not to seek certification ? To put it another way , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a certificate ? " Mr. Smith : " Well , we felt we had a number of things to lose by asking for a certificate . We could easily expend half a million or a million dollars ? and we are not a rich company . And then only to find out that the Congress had taken some of these reform measures ? and we think you are going to take some of them , certainly as it applies to air cargo . The second thing , Mr. Chairman , is that it has just been put to us very directly that you get your neck into that certification noose , and we are going to chop you up . And what I am talking about are the opposition counsel for some of the bigger carriers . And they will use the certification process as a weapon of and by itself to delay us from the needed solutions . "  | Smith and his counsel , Nat Breed , explained that Federal Express was not merely seeking special privilege for itself in seeking modification of the Board 's 416(b) power . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them that 416(b) was an outdated limitation on the Board 's discretion . And furthermore , they assured the committee they did not mind submitting to the certification process , provided Federal Express was given the breathing room an exemption from 416(b) would provide . On June 30 , 1976 , H.R.14623 , titled To Broaden the Power of the Civil Aeronautics Board to Grant Relief by Exemption in Certain Cases , was introduced in the House of Representatives by a group of 12 members . Three weeks later Senators Howard Baker and William Brock introduced in the Senate S.3684 , a similar bill which would grant Federal Express immediate relief pending certification by the CAB . Federal Express would be permitted to operate larger aircraft while it went through the typically complicated and lengthy certification process . Both bills were labeled by opponents , " the Federal Express Relief Bills . " Hearings began in August , 1976 , and a long list of witnesses was asked to appear before Congressman Anderson 's House Subcommittee on Aviation . The Air Transport Association 's Leo Seybold summed up the airlines ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of waves . The airlines strongly oppose H.R.14623 . It was introduced as special interest legislation because of the denial by the Civil Aeronautics Board . It is back door deregulation . " The opposition brought out a variety of arguments why Federal Express should be denied relief , including the one about the hub-andspokes distribution system which required all packages be flown first to Memphis for sorting , wasting enormous amounts of fuel . The company had heard this same argument from its industry opponents since the fall , 1973 . Shortly before his death , Robert Prescott , founder and chairman of Flying Tigers , came to Washington in August , 1976 , to attack the S.3684 bill . Although opposition came from the American Truckers Association and the Teamsters , they did not testify on this bill . It was the executives of Flying Tigers who were most vitriolic in their attacks on Federal Express . Prescott , who was very ill and spoke in a whisper , brought up the issue of foreign ownership of Federal Express , and he claimed it had " money galore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to the European-based Rothschild family 's financial interest in New Court Securities , the venture capital group which had assembled the Federal Express investor group along with White , Weld , and had taken a leadership role in guiding the company through its infancy . Prescott 's hostility was based on the fact that his Flying Tigers cargo line was regulated by the CAB , and that if S.3684 were approved , Federal Express would be unfairly free of regulation .  | Prescott further testified that Federal Express was not doing anything particularly unique , and granting relief " means getting into our cabbage patch that we have pioneered . " He continued with great hostility : " They are a specialty carrier . They are serving off-line points , off-line as far as we are concerned , because they are small lines . They are doing it at a very high price , and they now want to trade their motorcycle in for a Mack truck and get into the airfreight business that we are in . " The attacks and counterattacks were bitter . In order to counter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fred Smith testified before Glenn Anderson 's House Subcommittee in late August , 1976 , he requested he be put under oath . During the hearings in 1976 , Federal Express was advised by some of its friends to get better known on Capitol Hill , and also to initiate a grassroots campaign across the country to make legislators more aware of the company . So in June , 1976 , Washington attorney John Zorack was hired to serve as a lobbyist for the company . He remembered , " Nobody knew anything about Federal Express when H.R. 14623 and S.3684 were being considered . We were small time and insignificant to the power groups in Congress . It was tough getting any real sympathy when we were unknown . " Zorack continued , " We lobbied Senator Cannon real hard and worked with the staff people of several senators and congressmen . The Tennessee Congressional delegation was very helpful in our cause . " In addition to Zorack , Charles Schneider , who had been a staff writer for the well-known trade publication Aviation Week , was hired to undertake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mounted was based on a theme reminiscent of General Patton 's remarks against the Russians : " Let 's go in and fight the SOB 's now because we will have to sooner or later . " Some 43,000 Federal Express customers were sent copies of a brochure titled : " Sometimes Free Enterprise Needs A Little Help , " designed to help to gain legislative support for the two bills before Congress . As part of the same campaign , 535 members of Congress were targeted with promotion packets so they would be aware of what their constituents were requesting . Furthermore all company employees were mobilized for an organized letter campaign . Some were even encouraged to phone their legislators . Traditionally , this type of pressure campaign has been considered the least effective way of communicating with Congressmen and Senators , but in this case the company 's consultants felt it would be otherwise , and believed constituent mail would make a difference . Fred Smith , Art Bass , and several other company officers traveled to all parts of the nation soliciting help . They spoke at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of transportation professionals . Says Byron Hogue , Fred Smith 's versatile special assistant : " We traveled to the home turf of congressmen who held positions on  | committees important to deregulation . We would go to fund-raising dinners in Montana and barbecues in Texas . We would talk to these people in straight , face-to-face lobbying . " Federal Express undertook a strong direct sales campaign to Louisiana , Texas , Nevada , and several other states where many local chambers of commerce were most anxious to have overnight air express service . Its public relations staff arranged for numerous press conferences in these communities , and prepared follow-up articles telling the Federal Express story which were often published without change by local newspapers . The climax of this intensive grassroots campaign came just before October 1 , 1976 . In late September , H.R.15026 ? a bill which provided for reduced air fares for the elderly and handicapped ? was sent to the Senate for concurrence . H.R.15026 had been co-sponsored in the House by Congressman Glenn Anderson . Just prior to the vote on this bill on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Subcommittee on Aviation , was asked to tack S.3684 ? the so-called " Federal Express Bill " ? on to H.R.15026 as an amendment . Congressman Anderson warned Senator Cannon that if he did this , he would let H.R.15026 die in committee when the bill was returned to the House for final approval . Senator Cannon brought the amended bill before the full Senate , where it was approved , 73 to O. Congressman Anderson was upset at what happened to his bill . He called the amended bill , " blatant special interest legislation . " Consequently , he decided not to bring the amended bill before the House for final action , thus killing it . Friday , October 1st , was the eleventh hour for Federal Express , and it made one last attempt to get the bill out of Congressman Anderson 's Subcommittee before Congress adjourned the next day . Frank Maguire , then just a management consultant hired by Art Bass , had a friend who knew an aide to House Speaker Carl Albert . Maguire asked his help in trying to pressure Anderson to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that day Maguire received this answer from his friend : " Albert does n't want to do it . He is stepping down as Speaker of the House , and apparently has lost all interest in the Congress . He is sick and he is tired , and he just does n't give a damn . " The " Federal Express Bill " was dead . The months of lobbying work had proven fruitless . Smith and his Federal Express had received a major defeat . Why did Anderson refuse ? Flying Tigers had opposed Federal Express , and so had the Teamsters , and so had the powerful Air Transport Association . Many Flying Tigers employees lived in Anderson 's district , which was located just south of the Los Angeles International Airport . Moreover , his district was made up of several large blue collar suburbs and his constituents were strongly pro labor . And Anderson was probably sincere in his belief that Federal Express  | was asking for special treatment in the highly competitive and regulated air transportation industry . Later , when the shock of this defeat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a blessing in disguise , because the bill dealt only with the company 's present situation . We can now try for a broader bill which will change the whole law as it applies to the all-cargo operation . " The Federal Express board of directors convened in Memphis in mid-October , 1976 , to discuss the next strategy . The question arose again about filing for CAB certification . Brick Meers felt the company was not strong enough to weather the uncertainties of regulation . " Regulation is a negative , " he warned . And fellow board member Charley Lea warned about the " unknown excess costs associated with regulation . The regulators are not interested in profits ? they only act as policemen . " Not withstanding these complaints Smith wanted to file immediately . He argued , " The company will have regulatory freedom during the pendency of the certificate application . We also have the possibility of seeking an interim exemption utilizing non-controversial aircraft . " After extensive discussion , the decision to file was left pending . In point of act , Federal Express did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the airline industry appeared better than they ever had been before , but action on any proposed bills to bring this about would have to await the next session of Congress and to await the Carter Administration 's attitude toward the airline industry which would not be known until it assumed office in January of 1977 . Federal Express did not have to wait long . In February , 1977 , two bills were introduced : Senators Cannon and Kennedy introduced S.689 , a bill entitled , " Regulatory Reform in Air Transportation , " while Senators Pearson and Baker introduced reform bill , S.292 . Both bills were directed toward promoting competition and efficiency in the airline industry . In March , 1977 , President Carter asked Congress to support deregulation legislation . Consumer groups and activist academic economists , familiar with the status of commercial aviation , generally supported a major overhaul . But most of the scheduled carriers and labor representatives , as they had done in the past , opposed regulatory reform legislation . At the Senate hearings beginning in March , 1977 , the airline giants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not unexpectedly , strongly opposed any change . Again United was the lone exception : it continued to support deregulation . When Smith testified on S.292 and S.689 on March 24 , 1977 , he continued his attack on the airlines and what he called " bureaucratic red tape . " It was difficult , he said ? forgetting his own influence peddling of recent months ? for an entrepreneur who offers  | a better mousetrap to overcome influence peddlars and legions of bureaucrats . The great concern of Federal Express in the spring , 1977 , was what would happen if the Cannon-Kennedy and the Pearson-Baker bills were to run aground . Could the air cargo provisions be broken out and put into a separate bill ? The company still feared that , if it were to pursue the certification route with the CAB , it would be a two-to-six-year wait at best . Smith , reacting to the possibility of failure of these two Senate bills , started to stress an old theme in his speeches and interviews ? the difference between air cargo and passenger service . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " You can not lump them together in one regulatory scheme without doing violence to both . " He realized air cargo was not of major concern to Congress and that he would have to convince Congress the air cargo industry needed special attention . The almost always quotable Fred Smith optimistically described his uphill fight by remarking : " If you keep working at it , in the last analysis , you win . We 're like the old Ho Chi Minh . They 've got to kill us 100 times . All we have to do is kill them once . " Then , on August 13 , 1977 , Congressman Glenn Anderson introduced his regulatory reform proposal in H.R.8813 . His objective was to see not only greater freedom of entry and greater pricing flexibility , but also that airlines be given greater power to operate without government control . Although it may not have seemed like it , Anderson was for change . His refusal to cooperate with Federal Express in September , 1976 , was not because he favored the continuance of tight CAB regulation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for preferential treatment . Cornell professor Alfred E. Kahn , who had by this time been appointed by President Carter as chairman of the CAB , appeared before Anderson 's committee in October , 1977 , to plead for open entry . In his view open entry would not have an adverse effect on airlines offering combined passenger and cargo services , or on allcargo carriers like Flying Tigers . But Kahn thought some schedule carriers might have trouble adapting to deregulation because for the previous 39 years they had been protected by law from potential competitors . Congressman Anderson 's bill would have made it relatively easy for Federal Express , or for that matter other all-cargo airlines , to be certificated . Any carrier operating 12 continuous months prior to the date of the enactment of the new law , and carrying at least " 20 million interstate freight revenue ton-miles " during the same period , could apply for a license from the CAB to provide all-cargo air service . H.R.8813 proposed the payload weight ceiling on air taxi operators be raised from 7,500 pounds to 18,000 pounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other carriers who called themselves " The Air Carrier Committee for Regulatory  | Reform " published an eight-page tabloid-style newspaper called The Airline Free Press . The paper attempted to explain the benefits of regulatory reform . Federal Express ordered 100,000 copies to be distributed to its customers and consignees throughout the nation . A postcard was attached for the signatures of all of those persons or companies who supported the objectives outlined by Federal Express and the other firms distributing The Airline Free Press . These results were to be used to generate support for the deregulation bills currently before both the House and Senate . In the latter part of October there was concern at Federal Express that Congress would not pass any airline deregulation bill in 1977 . Senator Cannon , who remained a steadfast supporter of Federal Express , saw this danger too . On October 20th he arranged to have the air cargo deregulation provisions tacked on as an amendment to H.R.6010 . This House bill , which had been sent to the Senate for approval , provided for expanding the type of risks the Secretary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Senate conferees met on the bill October 26th . On October 28th the Senate approved by voice vote . Five days later the House approved it in similar fashion . There was no opposition . By this action , Congress had changed Section 17(a) , Title IV of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 by adding at the end a new section titled " Certificate for All-Cargo Air Service . " The bill became law on November 9 , 1977 , when it was signed by President Carter as PL 95-163 , the domestic all-cargo deregulation statute . Thus , the air cargo industry had the distinction of being the first industry to be decontrolled by Congress . Competition was opened up by eliminating the CAB 's control over market entry and pricing . Carriers were now permitted to use aircraft of any size . Fred Smith had had a strong hand in bringing about this change . Once more his persistence had paid off . Many of those who observed Smith during the Congressional ordeal believe this victory to be his greatest single achievement in building Federal Express . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ routes , free to set rates so long as they were not predatory , and free to choose its own equipment . Although new firms had to wait one year to apply for a certificate , Federal Express and over 50 other airlines were grandfathered in under the new law because they met the requirement of providing all-cargo service the previous year . Fortunately for Federal Express , while it battled its way through Congress in 1976 and 1977 to obtain relief , its planning group had been refining its development blueprint on the assumption the company would be authorized at some point to fly larger aircraft . Consequently , in December , 1977 , Federal made its first purchase of Boeing 727-100s . Each of these planes had an effective payload capacity of 42,000 pounds . Soon after this purchase , the acquisition  | of nine additional 727s brought into reality the tentative decision made earlier to have the 727-100s as the new backbone of the Federal Express fleet . The sturdy old Falcons , which had brought Smith and Federal Express a remarkably long way since the first one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secondary role to await eventual retirement from the fleet . A crisis filled era was ending at Federal Express . The board of directors showed its appreciation of Fred Smith 's work in securing favorable Congressional action by awarding him a $100,000 bonus . The investors and the bank lenders were obviously pleased the regulatory restraints had been taken off and the company was free to grow . Recapitalization , which had been discussed and fought over since 1975 , by Smith , the investors , and the banks now became a realistic objective to pursue . It appeared that , if Federal Express could get the deadweight of debt lifted , it could realize those profits Smith had dreamed about back during 1972 and 1973 in his early plans . Meaningful profits were just starting to surface . For the six months ending November 30 , 1977 , the company realized almost $8 million profit . At the end of that fiscal year in May , 1978 , the profit was $19.5 million . Without the freedom provided by air cargo deregulation , Federal Express would have faced a flattening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it probably would have remained a small , moderately profitable air transportation company . But the growth limitations imposed by continued reliance on the Falcon fleet would have negated continued interest by the investors and the lenders . Talented staff and technical people would have abandoned the company in droves . But with deregulation , Smith and his bright , entrepreneurallyoriented colleagues were given new motivation to try to take Federal Express to unprecedented heights in the air cargo industry .  | " When we started out , Emery could have kicked the crap out of us , but it did n't , " Art Bass declared in 1981 . " Now it 'll have to come into the swamp to fight us ? and it 's not going to be any contest . " Like so many of Art Bass ' or Fred Smith 's references to warfare to illustrate some competition situation , Bass ' reference to the bear and alligator allegory was repeated by other senior officers and lesser-ranked employees as I interviewed them . Bass expanded this allegory when he said : " If there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alligator . . . the outcome is going to be determined more by the terrain than by the individual skill of the combatants . Much of the competition has jumped into the water with us alligators and they are totally reacting to what we are doing . And in marketing , there is nothing I would rather see than a predictable competitor . You can make him do things you would n't do yourself . " This allegory is now an important part of the company culture . During my research for this book , as I moved through the network of Federal 's offices and city stations , I heard references to this allegory at least a dozen times . I even heard it from a CTV driver at midnight standing in the pouring rain at Newark Airport while I observed the loading of a 727 aircraft . It was just another example of how the company culture has been inculcated within Federal 's rank-and-file . This bear and alligator allegory is characteristic of the company 's iconoclastic and militant personality . Being attacked was never consider- ed anything more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the enemy . Its pugnacious spirit permeates most strategic marketing decisions . Its military metaphors and its Darwinian economic philosophy of " kill-or-be-killed " and " survival of the fittest " are deeply ingrained into both the overt and subconscious actions in daily corporate life . Retaliation is instinctive . Fighting is an heroic exercise helping to keep the competitive spirit nourished . After Federal 's first year , it gained momentum by taking business away in terms of both Emery and REA . It was almost too good to be true . " They were asleep , " claims Smith . " They were vulnerable . They did n't realize how much market there was for small packages . They had n't identified the market at all . " John Emery , Jr. , admitted Federal Express had taken business away from his company in the 1974 and 1975 period but , at the time , he was not very worried . He did not regard Federal Express as a long term threat . . . yet . Emery , like so many others involved directly or indirectly in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and incapable of survival . Few along Wall Street expected Federal to survive more than a few months . And perhaps deep down in their hearts Fred Smith , Roger Frock , Art Bass , and the other key Federal people did not expect the company to survive either . No one expected Federal 's gun to be loaded with real bullets ; it would prove to be a classic and costly mistake for the competition . Federal 's package volume grew very slowly in 1973 , but in 1974 it grew in daily volume , although the yield was well-behind its plan . By 1975 , it gained a 10 percent market share and yet it continued to struggle . Each year volume grew . In 1976 the company finally showed a profit . And three years later it not only handled one-third of all of the priority small packages but also it had reached a dominant position in the market from both volume and profit . From that point the always confident Fred Smith began telling financial analysts and the national business press , " We are much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behemoth to muscle its way into our business . " In effect , he was warning competitors and would-be competitors to beware because Federal Express was not going to permit anyone to gain an advantage on them . His company had taken the corporate equivalent of Hill 117 in Vietnam and he was not about to surrender it . Smith 's strategy continued to be to put greater distance between Federal and its competitors regardless of what Emery and the others were doing to penetrate the small package market . Like the effective Marine officer he once was , Smith is an advocate of combat readiness . Competitive challenges excite him and bring his leadership skills to peak energy . When Emery decided to challenge Federal with a full scale attack in 1979 and 1980 , Smith had the company ready . And when United Parcel Service announced in 1982 ,  | it was going to inaugurate overnight air service later that year with a large fleet of 727-100s , Smith reacted with a vengeance . No Marine outfit could possibly survive without field intelligence , and similarly Federal Express has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is mapped out like a military G-2 intelligence operation to assess the implications . It carefully monitors competitors ' financial and operating statistics . Its marketing staff conducts customer awareness studies of all of the competitors . Since its earliest days its surveillance has also included physical observance of competitors ' field movements . For example , in 1979 , when Emery set up a central sorting facility for its priority overnight package service at an airport near Smyrna , Tennessee , Federal had people positioned outside of the airfield to observe the nightly movements of aircraft and ground vehicles to get some indication of how well Emery was doing . In addition , Federal 's staff observed the actions of UPS carefully during the spring and summer , 1982 . As a result , management knew almost instantly that not only was UPS assembling its fleet of 727-100s in North Carolina , but also what color scheme and logo UPS had selected for its aircraft . Federal has consistently used information of this sort to develop a marketing strategy to combat competitive threats . Smith 's Marine Corps experience has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he were fighting in a military campaign . Competitors who do not understand his psychological makeup will be handicapped in preparing for Smith 's certain counterattack . He will storm back . Whether they have realized it or not , Emery , UPS , the Postal Service , Airborne , and the others in Smith 's mind are the industrial equivalent of the Vietcong , lurking out there in the field trying to better their positions at Federal 's expense . Until UPS entered the overnight market in September , 1982 , Federal 's principal competitor was Emery . After REA Air Express ' collapse in 1975 , Airborne moved into second position . Emery had always been aware of Federal 's presence in the market , but it was not until 1977 , that it began to take Federal very seriously . Emery finally recognized , primarily as a result of Federal 's success in building its market share , that the small package segment of the air freight market was the place to be . After nearly five years of napping , in 1978 , with a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small package and document business as a separate company profit center to compete head-on with Federal Express . It offered shippers " one-half price " coupons in an effort to build volume quickly . This tactic brought an immediate reaction from Federal Express . " Price cutting does n't help when you ca n't deliver the product , " Smith observed . " Emery 's helter-skelter , often contradictory strategies to try to build its small package volume border on the schizophrenic . " He felt Emery had received poor marketing advice . " Emery is making a mistake expanding beyond  | its traditional air freight business , " continued Smith . " They are opting out of their life 's work of 32 years . " Smith 's alligator was luring the bears into the swamp of a capital intensive operation and debt burden . Smith had created a new industry standard and if the competition were to survive it had to come off the hill into the Federal Express swamp . Federal Express viewed the price cutting as an all-out assault on it by Emery . The threat of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted desperately to protect and enhance its operating margins and above all it had to keep the margins attractive to investors . It knew that everybody gets hurt in a rate war . When Emery promoted its new service aggressively for about one year , then backed off , Federal was relieved . It had not been intimidated by Emery 's price cutting . As a matter-of-fact , Federal 's business expanded during Emery 's attack . Emery was struggling to find a marketing direction . The company apparently did not know the answer to the question , " What business are we in ? " In 1980 , it retained McKinsey &; Company , an international consulting firm , to help it define its place in the air freight market and to draw up an effective organization plan . From 1946 until 1981 , Emery had been a highly profitable , low-overhead air freight forwarder . Profits were made by working on a narrow spread between the rates charged by the scheduled airlines to accept shipments tendered by Emery , and the rates Emery charged its customers . Until 1975 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the airlines . But that year , it was forced to charter more and more aircraft in order to meet its overnight customer service commitments . And then in 1981 , the company made the most critical decision in its 35-year history when it decided to purchase its own fleet of jet aircraft . Although John Emery had earlier scoffed at Federal 's fleet calling it " Smith 's expensive toy " he finally recognized that , in order for Emery to survive , a similar fleet had to become a crucial element of his company 's future . Its days as merely a freight forwarder were over . And its debt-free days were also over as it was forced to become a far more capital intensive operation if it were to continue to compete in the overnight market . John Emery informed his company 's shareholders that in the short run the company would no longer be able to pay out , as it once did , a very high percentage of its annual earnings as dividends . Long term debt jumped overnight from zero in 1980 to $70 million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from just over $6 million to more than $60 million . Airborne Freight , in order to stay competitive , also made the same decision as Emery and at about the same time . And in the same way , it suddenly went from being a very profitable , low overhead firm with limited capitalization to one with a large debt structure required to acquire its new aircraft fleet and its central package  | sorting hub facilities in New Wilmington , Ohio . It spent $70 million on new equipment and facilities over an 18-month period to expand its express business . Airborne 's decision to fly its own planes did not create much of a ripple at Federal Express , but the decision of UPS to do the same thing caused a great deal of excitement . Federal Express experienced some anxious moments in 1982 , as it waited for UPS to make its move . The UPS threat gave Smith once more a dramatic cause to assert his leadership among Federal 's senior officers and the rankand-file . As part of the company 's culture since the beginning , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been the dominant firm in the surface parcel business . This employee-owned company ? one of the five largest privately-owned companies in America ? handled over 6 million packages daily . A small portion of these packages were shipped by air in a two-day service called Blue Label . The bulk of its packages moved by truck . Thus , the UPS decision to operate an overnight air service was considered the greatest challenge Federal Express had ever received . UPS is a very wealthy company . Its annual revenues approached $5 billion and at the start of 1982 , it had available $650 million in cash and short term investments . Because , UPS was almost debt free ? unlike Emery , Airborne and Federal Express ? the financing of its fleet of aircraft would present no burden . Smith had always admired UPS because of financial success and its efficient management . During Federal 's start-up in 1973 , it relied heavily on the technical help of ex-UPS employees . It adopted many of UPS 's administrative procedures and selling techniques until Federal had devised its own . Privately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head-to-head competition from UPS . But the formal announcement from UPS was in some ways useful to Smith because once again it gave him another cause to rally his company against . In the summer , 1982 , the tension at Federal Express mounted . In early August Fred Smith flew to Europe on a business trip and suddenly disappeared for several days . It turned out that he had gone to the Middle East and had turned up in Beirut during the height of the Israeli and PLO fighting in the heart of that war torn city . He had hitched a ride from Israel with an Israeli army officer to observe firsthand what was going on . His close advisors at Federal Express were convinced Smith went there to get the smell of battle so he could inspire his staff for the upcoming air battle with UPS . At the Summer , 1982 , Family Briefing for employees , perennial master-of-ceremonies Frank Maguire , in the ebullient manner of midmorning television game show hosts , set the competitive theme for the major speeches to follow by Federal 's president @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remarks buoyantly : " The competition is out there , and they are going to try to eat our lunch . The competition is tough , and the outcome is not yet decided .  | It 's a year of challenge ? a year of risk . We face the most challenging and competitive year in the history of this marvelous company . I say bring ' em on . Let 's hit ' em between the running lights . " Then Willmott , the company president , followed Maguire on stage with a long and rambling explanation of the need for employees to become more efficient and to concentrate on lowering the company 's cost structure . " If you are in that position , then you can keep your prices low , and keep your prices below the prices the competition charges for a similar product , " Willmott concluded . Maguire , issued his standard enthusiastic introduction of Smith who , then , in a 37-minute lecture , told the audience Federal Express was at the competitive frontier serving the new technological revolution in America , and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in front . He reiterated in a far less frenetic way what Maguire had told the employees about the competitive battle ahead . UPS began its new service in September , 1982 . Its delivery commitment was by 3:00 p.m. the next day in its initial 24-city market network . It offered no " on-call " pickup service and no tracing service on packages from the point of pickup to delivery . A customer 's packages had to be ready to go at the time UPS drivers made their scheduled daily calls to the vicinity of the customer 's office , plant , or warehouse . When Fred Smith heard of this he announced publicly , " If you 're using UPS and you miss the afternoon pickup , it 's too bad . The last stage has left Dodge . There 's the Get Mad Factor ' for UPS to worry about if the shipper has no alternative left to him . " At a meeting of Chicago security analysts held in the Palmer House during October , 1982 , Smith was quizzed hard about the competitive threat of UPS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Club in New York and McDonald 's are in the same business , but there is a great deal of difference . " Federal 's counterattack was based on differentiating the quality of service . His public relations staff sent out this message : " UPS is the best in the business at what they do ? moving low priority , consumer-oriented parcels where emergency is not a factor . But Federal , in turn , is best at what it does ? movement of the most vital and time-sensitive parcels and documents . " Federal 's marketing goal for 1983 was to establish clearly in the minds of customers that it offered a superior service . Explained Tom Oliver , head of marketing , " We want to dispel in the minds of the customers the idea that competitors are the equal to us when in fact they are not . We are not going to let competitors equal Federal Express . We will offer 10:30 a.m. delivery , more service options , Saturday pickups , package tracing , and call-backs to shippers informing them that the packages have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ package market started to get quite crowded . New firms entered and several existing firms like Emery , Airborne , Purolator Courier , and the leading commercial airlines stepped  | up their marketing efforts . Federal Express had defined the market and established its beachheads and gained control of strategic market areas in the preceding years , and consequently these other firms wanted a part of the action . The competition woke up to the fact that there was a huge market out there for small packages and documents needing some form of priority service . An all-out media battle commenced among the principal competitors to convince the customer that each company could provide a faster , more reliable service . Federal 's original priority commitment had been to deliver before 12:00 noon the next business day . Then , disregarding the enormous initial additional costs of the decision in October , 1982 , in response to mounting competition ? particularly from UPS ? Federal advanced its overnight service commitment to 10:30 a.m . At that time Emery and Airborne offered a " by 12:00 noon at the latest " service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service at a substantially lower price for those customers not caring whether their packages came in the morning or the afternoon . And most companies , including Federal , offered a secondday service at even lower prices . When the company acquired its fleet of 727s and DC-10s , built its Super Hub in Memphis , installed its state-of-the-arts electronic communication system , and added other support facilities Willmott proudly announced , " We 've got the best service ; we 've got the capacity ; we 've got the talent ; we 've got the best team ; we 're ready and open for business . " What Smith and Willmott were telling their competitors in so many words was , " If anyone tries to get Federal Express , we 'll get them first . " Clearly , the alligators at Federal Express had lured the Emery and UPS bears into the capital intensive , high-tech swamp and would try to keep them from the high ground .  | In 1973 the company had to tell the world quickly why its service was important . It had to explain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had put in place provided fast , reliable , overnight , air express service . Not only were time and funds unavailable to develop a comprehensive marketing and sales plan , but also the staff was overwhelmed putting out the " small fires " while launching daily service . Art Bass , Mike Fitzgerald and several others assigned to sales and customer service were simply spread too thin . In these early days of trying to reach the market , stopgap measures were a necessity . Because of the influence of several former United Parcel Service employees , including Mike Fitzgerald , Mike Basch and Ted Sartoian , heavy emphasis was placed on the direct selling techniques used successfully by UPS . But results from these direct calls on potential customers were too slow in coming . The technique of " one-on-one " personal selling was not getting the package count built up or the revenues rising fast enough to meet the targets of the company 's business plan . From 1973 , through mid-1975 , the actual daily package count figures fell far behind the projected daily volumes the marketing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months of 1974 , and the early months of 1975 , management shifted the marketing and sales approach . To survive , the company needed volume . Federal Express decided to take a radically different sales approach to marketing its services from the tradi- tional direct mail or " cold call " marketing techniques of UPS . Time was running out . After more than 18 months Federal Express was still struggling to gain public recognition . To make the American business public aware of its services , Federal decided to use a media approach using the theme , " Give us a try . " Television was first choice , but management also realized the importance of advertising in metropolitan dailies , business periodicals such as the Wall Street Journal and trade publications such as Air Cargo Magazine and Industry Week in the effort to get quick exposure . Federal 's critics did n't question the use of print media , but in reacting to the unexpected use of television they said in amazement , " Television advertising for a freight company ? Why , that 's unheard of . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the special province of newly appointed senior vice president , J. Vincent Fagan . Fred Smith gave Fagan the assignment of developing the corporate marketing plan and supervising the extensive research needed to identify more clearly the characteristics of the market for small packages . The late Vince Fagan became a crusader in fighting for the dollar and the personnel resources to launch his programs . Company funds were scarce because the monthly deficits were horrendous . Every dollar was needed to keep the company operational . Critics within the company 's management staff and several cautious board members often became nervous when Fagan presented bold , untried television ad campaigns which had budgets for far more dollars then they were willing to commit . Art Bass , when he assumed the presidency in February , 1975 , fought for Fagan 's bold plans and took the brunt of the criticism from the board members when they were skeptical about the potential effectiveness of the television ads . Bass continued to be one of Fagan 's chief supporters during Fagan 's seven-year association with Federal Express . Fagan was 39 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to leave New York to join Federal Express in Memphis . He came reluctantly , but he liked the idea of joining his long-time friend and former partner , Art Bass . Like Smith , Bass , and the other original senior officers , Fagan was blessed with a strong entrepreneurial spirit . His close associates described Fagan as being a very bright , articulate , and opinionated individual with an enormous ego . They described him as " not just tough , he was tough-tough . ' " He was always his own man and seldom yielded any ground once he had formulated his marketing plans . " Vince Fagan and Tucker Morse , the company 's attorney , were among the few who were not yes men ' on the staff , " said Mike Fitzgerald admiringly . " They were n't afraid at critical times to tell either Fred Smith or the board of directors they were wrong . " One of Fagan 's associates remembers one such confrontation between Smith and Fagan . " Take for example the day Vince Fagan ,  | our head marketing and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marketing suggestions . Fagan kept pointing out the flaws in Smith 's idea , but Fred kept coming back as if he had n't heard Vince 's points . What Vince did n't realize was that Fred was using his well-honed wear-em-down-technique ' on him . Not only was Vince as stubborn as Smith , but also Vince was one of just two or three guys in the company who could get away with telling Fred some of his ideas were dumb . Neither yielded an inch as the argument dragged on . Finally , in desperation , Mike Fitzgerald slipped Fagan a note which read : Vince , if Fred orders a chicken to pull a freight train , you go out and hook him up . ' Vince was a real prima donna . He would really carry on sometimes when he was n't getting his way , and he was very rough on some of his subordinates . " The two times I interviewed Vince Fagan I was impressed by this seemingly self confident former advertising executive who inhabited an office , blue with cigarette smoke , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imposing figure as he leaned forward with his arms on the desk . He had a shock of silver , curly hair which made him look like an impresario , and as we spoke he looked at me as if he were x-raying me . I was never sure who was interviewing whom . He was the most combative yet cooperative member of this executive team I interviewed , but to be fair , this combativeness , as I learned later , may have been due to his awareness that he was gravely ill with cancer . Fagan is credited with building the marketing plan which helped the company enjoy increasing consumer success after the struggling and disappointing start-up years of 1973 and 1974 . Those who knew him described him as an adept marketer , but often irrascible and sometimes difficult to work with . This , however , did not lessen his colleagues ' admiration of him . Reflecting on those difficult years , Bass says of Fagan : " Vince kept his eye on the ball . He was researchoriented and used this tool to back up his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Fagan was also an effective salesman for his program . At times Fagan would tell management , " There is an enormous , untapped market in the United States just waiting for a service like that offered by Federal Express . The company should n't be timid in going after it . " He stressed that the company 's marketing needed to address the question of a twotiered market . One market was the traditional distribution sector . These were the shipping departments and the mail rooms and loading docks of business and industry ? what the company called the " back door market . " The other market was called the " front door market , " since it consisted of executive offices or what are sometimes called the " papermills of America . " In this front door market were the ad agencies , architectural firms , banks , consultants , law firms , and similar business and financial services . In the first tier market , or back door business , Federal Express  | had to compete head-to-head with Emery , Airborne , United Parcel Service , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ airlines . The other tier was a nontraditional market , and a market that few people had precisely identified or understood very well . Within this first tier of potential customers were those in the business and professional service industries . At best , those in the second tier may have shipped by air on rare occasions . But Vince Fagan felt these front office groups might constitute a strong customer base if given a sufficient reason to use air express overnight service . His strategy was to get the attention of the people in the mailroom or the shipping departments as well as the secretaries who daily make decisions about what mode of transportation will be used to ship packages and documents as well as which air express company will be called . Fagan recognized soon after his arrival in Memphis that the company needed to identify precisely what marketing approach should be taken to build volume quickly . His choice was to use advertising to reach a mass market versus the traditional direct " cold call " approach to reach individual accounts . In May , 1978 , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Marketing Department . Management decided it needed to gain more control over direct sales so it could respond to the inquiries of the less frequent shippers who were beginning to call Federal as a result of the company 's broad-based advertising . The process of converting potential customers to sales needed improvement . The sales force had been dispersed under the direction of the four divisional general managers while customer service had been handled by the local city stations . As a result , there had been no centralized customer service system . And , in some of the regional areas , it was clear that administrative chaos prevailed . Fagan had been the company 's biggest critic when it came to evaluating the contribution of the sales force . His recommendation had long been , " Let 's spend another $1 million on advertising and do away with the salesmen . " Consequently , he downplayed the direct " cold call " sales approach in which salesmen call on prospects in person , and one at a time . He considered this costly and nonproductive . This method of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1972 , when the company was selling exclusively its charter express cargo service . Fagan was negative toward the company 's field sales force , since he did not believe it was capable of contributing much business volume . He saw the urgency to build volume . He had long felt that advertising was the way to stimulate quick growth in package volume . In the years of greatest adversity , 1974 to 1977 , Fagan was absolutely right . In 1978 , with deregulation safely behind it , Federal Express would be more secure , and it would also have more funds to commit to both advertising and direct sales .  | Despite the change , the sales organization continued to be a neglected child . Fagan continued to give it no place of prominence in his annual marketing plans . Not until 1980 , when Smith made the decision to transfer the sales function to the Ground Operations Department , did the sales group start receiving serious attention from management . In Federal 's start-up years this sales organization was administered from Memphis . But from 1975 to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Following the 1978 reorganization , control reverted back to Memphis . The flip-flopping continued in 1980 , when control once again went back to the field . Prior to 1981 , the company 's direct sales strategy had been so chaotic that it had been impossible to build an effective sales organization . Craig Bell , the veteran head of sales , explained that " key company sales executives were frustrated . Their morale was low . " He and his colleagues wanted to set the record straight and prove that the sales organization was contributing far more to the company than it was costing as Fagan believed . With Fagan gone in 1980 , they felt they could get top management 's " ear . " After seven years , Smith finally gave them the resources to emerge from their secondary role following the 1980 companywide reorganization . The salesgroup was challenged to upgrade its personnel and to prove its effectiveness in attacking the market . One change made was the decision to be more selective in direct sales calls . With each sales call estimated to cost an average @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sales efforts , and concentrate on accounts shipping at least three packages per day . Previous approaches were often of the " shotgun " variety where salesmen were told to go out and make 20 or 25 calls per day on anybody who would listen to their sales presentations . Sales training was also strengthened as part of the upgrading after the 1980 reorganization . When the business historian examines Federal Express , the long term contribution of Vince Fagan not only to the company but also to the air freight industry as well will be seen to be substantial . Fagan is responsible for bringing to the industry state-of-the art advertising and marketing concepts . These contributions are basically four in number . He introduced the " Air Express Buying Power Index " which accurately identified the market potential . His market research group contributed mightily to the construction of a rational pricing policy . Fagan seems to have been the first to apply behavioral analysis using " focus group techniques " to the air express customer . But most important were his pioneering efforts in the use of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where before it had never been tried . Among the first tasks Fagan 's group undertook was organizing an industry monitoring program so the competition and industry trends could be tracked . He felt this would assist in setting prices , uncovering  | new service opportunities , and measuring Federal 's performance or penetration within the major air freight markets . Fagan placed heavy emphasis on developing better package volume prediction models . His " Air Express Buying Power Index " was developed by examining the correlation between certain Standard Industrial Classification ( SIC ) codes and the actual use of air freight by companies in those industries . His staff measured specific economic characteristics in all cities , including such things as the makeup of the industrial bases , the number of hospital beds , and the specific companies in those cities which might be major prospects for shipping timesensitive , high priority packages by air express . Customers were classified by SIC categories and ratios were developed for the number of packages expected to be shipped per employee in each category . This list was then matched against SIC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it is known in the industry marketing parlance , BPI ) for each metropolitan area . Fagan utilized these figures to identify the top urban markets for potential business . In his first marketing plan in 1975 , he selected 23 target markets which , according to his statistical model , had 60 percent of the total air package buying power in the nation . This was the basis for Fagan 's initial efforts to allocate on a rational basis , sales and promotion dollars for television and print media advertising , and direct sales calls and special promotions . In later plans package prediction models were refined . Company researchers examined the evolving characteristics of the expanding Federal Express customer base and noted any features which would appear to call for further adjustments of the model . Thus , if package counts fell below the projected share for a particular city , Fagan 's staff would try to find the reasons for the lag . Some of these reasons they found in their investigations were poor station management , local strikes , unemployment , or increasing competition in given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basis for the aircraft lift model to determine nightly the type and the number of aircraft to use for the various cities receiving service . Suggestions on pricing policies and on new types of services were also part of the responsibilities of Fagan 's market research group . Competitor 's rate structures were carefully watched and questions of price elasticity were considered . The company wanted to know if there was customer resistance to any increases in rates . How high could it raise rates on the Priority 1 or the Courier-Pak products before customers resisted and looked for alternative ways to ship their items ? Federal Express had always believed it could prove to customers that it was rendering a valuable service in dealing with time-sensitive shipments , and that customers are willing to pay for the service so long as they felt the value they received from the service exceeds its cost . Yet Federal Express , in preparing its pricing recommendations , had recognized that its rates could not be set  | too far above any competitor offering comparable types of service . In the early years , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scaring away customers . In order to build market share , the strategy was to opt on the lower side . Fagan , however , argued that prices should be raised . He pointed out that the company 's outstanding service was being recognized by customers and that they would pay a higher price for the better product . The pricing decisions have been worked out jointly between the marketing staff and the corporate financial staff . The trick has been to set prices at a high enough level to protect company profit margins while at the same time making absolutely certain that the company was not pricing itself out of the market . The task in marketing strategy has been to convince customers that Federal Express charges the prices it does because it is rendering a superior type of service . " We 're good , that 's why ! " Federal has consistently bragged to the business press . " We deliver on time all of the time , and we are attentive to the customer 's needs . " Behavioral analysis to test consumer reaction to new products @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freight industry by Fagan . He installed the " focus group technique " that has been used so effectively by Procter &; Gamble and many other major consumer products companies to elicit consumer reactions to new or existing products as a part of developing marketing plans . In selected test cities a half-dozen or so individuals not employed by Federal Express would be invited to take part in an open , free flowing discussion led by a professional moderator . After a suitable warm-up period in which the discussion leader got the group conversing , the groups are then asked to discuss their opinions or attitudes toward a specific product or a service that Federal Express was considering for introduction . This type of semi-structured market research is designed to identify problems and also to produce new ideas . The responses from such an exercise are ordinarily not quantifiable . " We strategize ' from what we hear the focus groups talking about , " says Alyce Craddock . What she meant by this was that the information is helpful in planning a marketing approach . An enormous amount of marketing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company . Given the limited funds for marketing in 1974 and 1975 , Fagan felt that extensive information was needed to develop the company 's marketing plan . When the initial market planning was completed , Fagan strongly recommended that heavy emphasis be given to television advertising with secondary support from print media advertising . Fagan moved quickly in late 1974 to launch the company 's first major advertising campaign . The strategy was to use an advertising technique called " top-of-the-mind awareness . " Federal Express needed desperately to make the public aware of its existence , and then convert a large number of people to users of its services .  | Advertising budgets given to Vince Fagan to work with in the early years were meager by later standards . This early stringency forced Federal Express to find ways to obtain the highest market penetration within the constraints of thin budgets . The board of directors had to be convinced that the advertising budgets Fagan was promoting would get results . At the June , 1975 , board meeting , company president Art Bass was able to tell the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 27 percent in New York and Los Angeles where Federal had targeted its first television campaign , " America , You 've Got A New Airline . " Bass was convinced there was a causal link between advertising and sales . " These results , " he asserted , " showed that to be true . " Still , some board members could not help but recall nineteenth-century merchandiser John Wanamaker 's statement , " I know half my advertising dollars are wasted , but I do n't know which half . " The company was operating on very thin budgets in 1975 , and Federal 's board , which consisted largely of representatives of the venture capital group , was very nervous about spending funds on anything other than operations . The choice of New York and Los Angeles for the local spot television campaign in the summer , 1975 , was based on Fagan 's estimate that these two market areas had some 38 percent of the air freight potential . This was the most market coverage the company could get for its paltry $190,000 advertising campaign . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Emery , plus numerous other freight forwarders , the major all cargo airlines , and the combination passenger-cargo airlines made these two cities , plus Chicago , the most competitive air freight markets in America . The fact that Federal 's package volume increased 27 percent after the campaign was a very good omen for the company . In his marketing plan , Fagan decried the fact that Federal 's lack of network advertising hindered the development of business across the country . The plan for 1976 , recommended that the sales force concentrate on the top 1,000 shippers in their personal calls , and that a mail campaign be directed to the nation 's top 10,000 largest shippers . Heretofore Federal Express had not advertised in the Yellow Pages , and it had no " 800 " number listing in the telephone directories . These shortcomings were singled out for immediate correction . The overall strategy was aimed at the task of building awareness , particularly in the top ten markets : New York , Los Angeles , Chicago , San Francisco , Philadelphia , Boston , Detroit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was believed to be a combination of television advertising , newspapers , and popular business magazines , plus direct mail and direct solicitation . Yet once more budget stringencies required hard choices of how to allocate scarce dollars . For media advertising in fiscal 1976 , Federal budgeted only $1.2 million .  | Emery outspent Federal Express in 1976 in marketing effort and it had twice the number of salesmen in the field making direct calls on customers and prospects . Federal 's management girded for what it felt would be a strong marketing counterattack by Emery and Airborne as these major competitors began to recognize the size and character of the market for small packages . Emery started a television advertising campaign , but Airborne continued to sell exclusively by direct customer calls and canvassing by mail . Airborne believed these were the most effective means of landing the accounts of big shippers . And at that time they were correct . Federal 's advertising budget in fiscal 1977 was $2.5 million . The decision was made to use local spot television advertising in the top 17 markets east of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1958 , which would have permitted Federal to use larger aircraft , was still an issue before Congress in late 1976 and early 1977 . This was the reason management had to downplay the West Coast metropolitan areas in its television advertising campaign . As long as it was limited to flying the company 's small Falcons , it was not optimistic about its changes of improving its service to the West Coast . The new advertising emphasis was placed on building an awareness of Federal Express in " the executive suites " of America . The large metropolitan dailies , plus popular business and weekly news periodicals such as Business Week and U. S. News and World Report , were used to attract business in smaller regional markets not covered by the spot television campaign . Fagan was anxious to promote greater sales of the Courier-Pak product , and felt that its primary market was in the front offices of business firms , not back in the shipping departments of these same companies . When air cargo deregulation cleared Congress favorably in late 1977 , Federal 's growth expectations accelerated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Express could go after every time-sensitive package in America and possibly in a good portion of urbanized Canada . Reflecting this high optimism , advertising expenditures were increased to nearly $7.8 million in fiscal 1979 ; $10.6 million in 1980 ; then to over $25 million in both fiscal 1982 and 1983 . The bulk of the 1982 budget was spent on network and spot television advertising . Prime time network programming absorbed the heaviest expenditures . Nightly network news and major weekend sports attractions were popular outlets . Several million potential decision makers who send packages or documents air express were sitting in front of the television sets for these programs . The target audience was both adult male and female . The campaign to introduce the Overnight Letter was budgeted at some $6 million of the $25 million in 1982 . About $1 million was allocated for direct mailings , and another $1 million went for listings in the Yellow Pages . In seven years the advertising budget had increased by 25 times .  | By any historical standards the recent budgets are exorbitant for an air freight company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very modest outlay when compared , for example , with consumer products companies . Procter &; Gamble spends almost 21 times as much . McDonald 's spends five times as much . Beginning in the 1980s air express advertising in general has escalated . Most of Federal 's major competitors have been forced to spend heavily to try to improve their market shares . They have recognized that Federal Express ' aggressiveness in media advertising had helped it maintain its wide competitive lead . Emery came forward first , then it was followed by Purolator Courier , Burlington Northern , Flying Tigers , U. S. Postal Service , and finally , Airborne . All recognized how much success Federal Express had had with Fagan 's advertising approach in building awareness and gaining new customers . Market awareness ? the critical focus of Federal 's marketing plans in 1974 and 1975 ? ceased to be a concern after several years of effective media advertising . Company-sponsored surveys showed a high market awareness . Studies showed that more people were aware of Federal Express than Emery . The statistical difference in Federal 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Federal had climbed from obscurity in 1973 , to a status of high name recognition in just a very few years . Federal 's marketing strategy , influenced by Fagan 's innovations and his persistent defense of these innovations , had carried the company a very long way . Federal found how to use effectively the various media to build volume and customers . It found a vast , untapped market and exploited it while its competitors largely opted to follow along with a " me-too " approach . The use of advertising accelerated from the time Federal entered into the successful marriage with Ally &; Gargano , Inc. , its innovative advertising agency . Most of Ally &; Gargano 's campaigns brought results . And the financial outlays to stage them were not particularly burdensome on Federal 's annual budgets except in those early crisis years , 1973 through 1975.  | Late to Bed , Early to Rise Advertise , Advertise , Advertise When John Moschitta , the slip-tongued executive on Federal 's award winning commercial , " Fast Paced World " ends with his " **34;1840;TOOLONG .

" the voice-over announcer intones the now famous household phrase , " Federal Express . When It Absolutely , Positively Has To Be There Overnight . " Few of us outside the air express industry recognize the revolutionary implications of this kind of ad campaign . The quite simple truth seems to be that Federal Express very largely owes its huge marketing success to the radical implementation of this kind of television advertisement . Over the years 1974-1983 , there have been five basic campaigns devised by Federal 's Marketing Department in collaboration with the New York advertising agency of Ally &; Gargano . The first of these campaigns began in 1975 , and was known around the company as " the establishment stage " since its chief aim was to build a broad public awareness of Federal 's existence . This " America You Have A New Airline " campaign was quickly followed by a second stage which focused on competition with Emery . Federal confessed that these memorable " Twice As Good As The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make a name  | for itself at Emery 's expense . The third stage in 1976 , stressed Federal 's efficiency and effectiveness on the theme " Take Away Our Planes And We 'd Be Just Like Everybody Else . " But it was the fourth campaign in 1977 which really caught the public 's purse strings in 1977 with the innovative use of exaggerated humor which attempted to build an empathetic bridge to the customer by focusing on the everyday human foibles of the workaday world . So successful was this introduction of humor that all subsequent advertising campaigns seemed to be blends of earlier themes and this new comic technique . When Federal put its advertising account up for competitive bidding in 1974 , to its great good fortune it selected Ally &; Gargano , Inc. , a medium-sized New York agency . Management felt that hiring this firm ? known best in the industry at the time for its creativity ? would insure that the Federal Express account would be taken seriously and that it would get the best efforts of the agency despite the very modest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partner , Amil Gargano , were veterans in the profession . They had reputations of being less conformist than most of the wellknown Madison Avenue agencies . Fagan , when asked why he recommended them answered : " They were bomb throwers , ' and they could give us the dramatic advertising we needed . " Carl Ally was described by author Robert Glatzer as " an articulate , combative man who talks and acts like a cross between a college English teacher ( which he was ) and a pool hustler . " Prior to his work on the Federal Express account his best advertising campaigns were noted for their pungency . He had earned a considerable reputation within the advertising industry for his work in the 1960s on the Volvo and the Hertz campaigns . Hertz had been under attack for several years by Avis ' skillful advertising , and it had lost market share in the rent-a-car industry . The Avis advertising campaign had the well-known theme , " When You 're Only No. 2 , You Try Harder . Or Else . " Hertz had been put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then Avis chairman Robert Townsend , author of the caustic , irreverent book attacking corporate management , Up the Organization . Ally was hired by Hertz late in this protracted media war and instructed to help the badly wounded Hertz fight back and regain public confidence . The Ally-directed campaign lasted one year and it contributed to the reversal of Hertz 's precipitous slide in rent-a-car market shares . In order to obtain the largest possible viewing audience in several selected metropolitan markets for the company 's advertisements , television was the principal outlet selected for the Federal Express account . Print media was only employed to play a role in those cases where the company wanted to attract the attention of decision makers in special audiences for which these trade and business  | publications were especially tailored . The first campaign , the so called " establishment stage , " had the paltry budget of $800,000 . The first television ad which was aired in only a few major cities had this attention-grabbing message : " America , You 've Got A New Airline . But Do n't Get Excited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No Meals , No Movies , In Fact , No Passengers . Just Packages . " In the New York market , this 30-second ad was changed to say , " New York , You 've Got A New Airline . . . " and in Los Angeles , it was , " Los Angeles , You 've Got A New Airline . . . " The June , 1975 , campaign lasted four weeks . Local television 30-second spot announcements were used . Full-page print ads were also run simultaneously in the Los Angeles Times , the New York Times , the Wall Street Journal , and the other leading dailies in the target cities . This ad theme had simplicity . The intention was to build strong recall into the message . Federal hoped that the public 's curiosity would be aroused by the tantalizing announcement that this company called Federal Express was operating an airline in which packages would be treated like passengers . A technique called " comparative advertising " was the foundation of Federal 's second campaign . In these ads Federal 's aim was to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those of its competitors by proving their service had a qualitative advantage . Traditionally in the advertising world , it was considered unprofessional or even unethical to publicly insult your competitor in advertising . But that particular ethical standard had been under attack since the 1960s . By the 1970s this tradition had been scuttled and it was fair game to belittle your competitor . Emery , perhaps the only company with national visibility in the air freight industry at the time , was selected as Federal 's prime target . " Let 's take on the leader , " the Federal Express planning staff wrote in its marketing plan . " If you are No. 1 , you do n't attack your competitor . But if you are n't No. 1 , you attack the leader . " It was a technique taken from the handbook of traditional U. S. Naval tactics ? " Pick out the biggest one and fire . " When John Emery described his company in those days he would say through his public relations staff , " We are the Tiffany , the Rolls-Royce of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in air freight . " The Emery-Federal Express match-up was staged to be similar to the Hertz-Avis confrontation of the mid-1960s . Its objective was to draw attention to Federal 's higher quality of service . Carl Ally , the experienced strategist who led the campaigns of the Hertz-Avis advertising war , knew how to stage a direct attack . Ally had stenciled Emery 's name on an arsenal of media bombs and Fred Smith was ready to authorize his media guerrillas to move on Emery . Federal 's second campaign was launched in mid-1975 using the basic theme , " Who 's Cheaper ? Who 's More Reliable ? " Vince Fagan  | explained , " We feel we can take advantage of the Emery image by creating our own image as an aggressive underdog offering a more superior service than the undisputed leader . " The decision was really based on management 's conclusion , " What do we have to lose by a direct assault on Emery ? " Fred Smith , a student of military history , obviously knew that frontal attacks seldom bring a clear cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found in his studies that the attacker must have a 3-to-1 advantage in firepower to defeat a well-entrenched enemy . In the staged Federal Express-Emery battle , Emery took some direct hits but refused to retaliate . It grumbled about Federal 's research methodology employed to create the data used in the campaign . Emery also was taken back by the brazenness of the comparative advertising campaign , but it did not launch a major counterattack on this brash young upstart company from Memphis . Federal Express , despite being much smaller and less well-known , did have some special advantages over Emery . First , Federal specialized in small packages and documents rather than in across-theboard , general air freight shipments . And second , it had its own fleet of planes . It could exercise total control over the nightly movement of its packages and documents . Emery had not segmented its market . It was handling all sizes of air cargo . In 1975 , Emery was still an air freight forwarder operation utilizing the air lift provided by scheduled passenger carriers to get its shipments to consignees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Opinion Research Corporation ( ORC ) , a national market research firm located in Princeton , New Jersey , to evaluate the relative performance of five air freight services between 24 city pairs such as Milwaukee to El Paso , Phoenix to Washington , D. C. , or Dallas to Kansas City during a two-week period in April , 1975 . The services compared were Emery 's , Airborne 's , REA Air Express ' , and Federal Express ' Priority 1 ( overnight service ) and Standard Air Service ( two-day service ) . Identical nine-pound packages were shipped to and from a selection of cities ? large and small . Logs were kept by both shippers and consignees who were market research correspondents for ORC . The ORC study found that Federal 's Priority 1 service was twice as fast as that of REA Air Express , Airborne , and Emery . It found that Federal 's Priority 1 service was cheaper than Federal 's competitors . And it found Federal 's Standard Air Service to be faster and nearly 40 percent cheaper than any competitors ' services . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while far from ideal in April , 1975 , was the best among the competitors . Using these results Federal prepared an advertising campaign showing graphically two piles of packages ? Federal 's and Emery's.  | Federal 's pile was twice as high . Federal used this dramatic display to illustrate its statement that it was twice as good as Emery who was supposed to be the best in the business in getting packages delivered by noon the following day . John Emery , Jr. , yelled , " Foul ! " He complained the results were artificial and contrived . " The problem is you can prove anything you want to with such a study , " groused Emery . Along with John Emery , the other competitors pointed out that the ORC survey was weighted in favor of off-line areas , that is , those cities and towns not wellserved by the scheduled airlines . They claimed that 60 percent of air freight moves exclusively between the top 50 metropolitan cities where commercial airline service was then concentrated . Federal Express conceded that the ORC study might have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this did not dissuade it from capitalizing on this comparison in its advertising copy . It had several thousand brochures prepared to mail to potential customers showing the results of this service comparison . Federal ran ads captioned , " If You 're Using Emery , Do n't Let Your Boss See These ' Figures , " then it inserted the results of the test study . The advertising theme was " competitive domination " with emphasis on statements like , " Twice As Good As The Best In The Business . " Emery 's advertising at that same time stressed that it was a dollar less and an hour faster than its competitors . Federal 's ad blitz with the ORC results was designed to dispel these Emery claims . But in 1976 , Fagan 's arguments about the inefficiency of direct selling had been accepted and because of continued tight budgets , Federal 's marketing strategy had to be to spend as efficiently as possible . Instead of sending its sales force out to call on anyone who might conceivably ship a package , Federal decided to concentrate on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consequence , the strategy of the third campaign was to use television , magazine , and newspaper advertising to capture the attention of these many thousands of occasional shippers who made up the remaining part of the market . The key advertising message of this new campaign launched in 1976 , stressed the company 's service efficiency because ? unlike Emery , Airborne , Purolator Courier , and the others ? Federal operated its own planes . The ad caption taunted " Take Away Our Planes and We 'd Be Just Like Everybody Else . " Fagan explained the strategy : " We told everybody why we were better than Emery and the rest of them . We demonstrated that the closed loop system ? where Federal Express , through the use of its own planes and trucks , maintained control over the package from pickup to delivery ? was superior . " Federal 's " taking off the gloves " approach to advertising began to pay dividends . In the period from 1975 to 1977 , the average daily package count rose from an average of 11,000 to 22,000 per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Federal Express ? When It Absolutely , Positively Has To Be There Overnight " was the theme introduced during the next evolutionary stage of the advertising strategy . This was considered the most forceful and memorable advertising statement to date made by the company . Today it remains the permanent corporate advertising statement , and it is affixed to most advertising copy . " Absolutely , Positively Overnight " identifies Federal Express to the public in much the same manner as " We Try Harder " identifies Avis and as " Breakfast of Champions " has historically identified Wheaties . Dependability of service is what the company most wanted to emphasize in this marketing statement . " We wanted to take the worry out of the mind of the senders of packages , " Fagan said at the time . " Despite the results we were getting from all of these commercials , " Fagan felt there was a weakness . " Viewers could n't remember them . The commercials meant nothing to them . What we finally figured out was that the way to get around this problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could see themselves and all of the forces aligned against them . We made the decision to introduce comic absurdity into most of our commercials . " Zany humor in commercials was introduced in the early 1960s by **37;1903;TOOLONG Stan Freberg . " Commercial airlines would n't dare use humor , " Fagan told me . " They 're too conservative . We felt humor helps our advertising break through TV 's noise level . Many advertising agencies were afraid of it and felt too much humor might backfire on the advertiser . It could break the so-called boredom barrier ' and assist Federal Express in gaining rapport with potential customers . " The strategy has worked well for the company . Humor , based on empathy , scored the biggest successes for the company . Ally &; Gargano were surprised at the effectiveness of such a contrived effort to achieve empathy . Fagan once remarked about these ads , " People viewing the commercials loved them . They saw themselves . Why , even at Federal Express , we saw ourselves in these predicaments . " For example , many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the junior executive whose job was on the line if the important package he was responsible for shipping to Birmingham or Peoria did not get there on time . Viewers could relate to the great feeling of relief for these office workers when the package got in the hands of Federal Express . Most of us out there in the audience had somewhat the same crisis at one time or another , and could grasp the great sense of relief when everything finally worked out all right . The public began to expect most of Federal 's commercials to be humorous and regardless of how many times they viewed a particular commercial they still laughed . A typical scene depicts a harried owner of an electric light bulb store phoning Dingbat Air Freight  | and saying , " If those bulbs are n't here tomorrow morning , I 'm out of business ; do you hear that ? " The fade out on this 30-second commercial shows Dingbat Air Freight 's truck pulling up in front of the store which by then had a sign in the window , " Out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't use Federal Express , the nightmare will come true ? and you 've gone bankrupt ! Among the most successful television ads have been those using actor John Moschitta playing the role of a fast-talking , decisive chief executive making decisions and barking out orders at a frenetic pace . In a typical ad , this small balding man with unusually deep , penetrating eyes is on the telephone talking at lightning speed with a business contact . Behind him is his harried assistant operating maniacally a duplicating machine at a furious pace . In the space of 30 seconds , Moschitta covers a 182 word script . The generally successful humor component of Federal 's advertising strategy has been retained on a permanent basis . But in a few instances the intended humor backfired . Not everyone thought Federal 's commercials were amusing . The television ad titled " Easy To Use , " showing the octogenarian chairman of the board trying to call Federal Express , was criticized by the Grey Panthers for poking fun at elderly people . The ad depicted the elderly and presumably senile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Hell00000 . . . Federal . " But after saying , " Hell00000 , " in desperation , snapping his fingers , he can not remember whom he has dialed . The deep , authoritative voice-over announcer concludes this episode stating : " All you have to do is pick up the phone , and we 'll pick up the package . Even the chairman of the board can do that . " The greatest flap , however , came in mid-1982 when the American Postal Workers Union bitterly protested what it considered to be a highly offensive slur upon postal workers . The television sketch showed two postal workers behind the Post Office 's Express Mail window either ignoring or being rude to patrons because they were more interested in discussing among themselves the subject of retirement and how many more years they had to work . The Union and the Postmaster General both felt that characterization of postal workers as being lazy , rude , and capable of rendering only poor service was a gross insult . They requested Federal Express and the television networks take the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particularly since an opinion poll by the independent Roper organization , commissioned by the Postal Service in August , 1981 , found that 85 percent of those persons interviewed were satisfied with their mail service . And in another poll conducted by the Postal Service 's own staff , postal workers were rated by the public " above average " in employee courtesy and in efficiency of service . Federal Express , which had attacked the Postal Service previously in their television and print advertising , delayed the  | cancellation for two or three weeks , thus capturing a great deal more public attention and free publicity . The national news networks all covered the story on their prime time nightly news segments . A CBS-television affiliate in Los Angeles even went to the effort of testing the services of both the Postal Service and Federal Express by sending packages through both systems to see what would happen . The test results showed that Federal 's service had lived up to the company 's advertised commitment of delivery ontime , while the Postal Service 's performance languished far behind its service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then the company spokesman , fired back , " This is a very competitive business we 're in . The Post Office . . . chose to enter this competitive market with their overnight business . We play hard ball out there in this competitive market . " Federal 's attack on the Postal Service had been in planning a year or so before the flap . It was planned in conjunction with the launching of Federal 's Overnight Letter product , a private letter service designed to compete head-on with the Postal Service 's widely-promoted Express Mail Service . Examples of the stinging captions prepared for print media ads were , " Maybe , Perhaps The Day After Tomorrow Or The Next Day , " and the equally abrasive , " Absolutely , Positively Untouched By Civil Servants . " Federal Express definitely wanted combat with the Postal Service . Some individuals within Federal Express cautioned against this onslaught , but the marketing people viewed it as an opportunity to get the public 's attention . Top management decided that the Postal Service was fair game and the American public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much was at stake with Federal 's Overnight Letter product , and a number of management careers were on the line . Fred Smith gave this program his blessing and , at the time of the decision to get competitive with the Post Office , said aggressively of the Overnight Letter , " It has the potential to destroy our competitors . " Another pitch used to sell their air express service asserted that Federal Express could eliminate the worry a person might have if he sends a letter through the Post Office . One memorable advertisement , called " Shakes , " which won an award from the prestigious Advertising Age , shows a man holding a letter shaking violently as he thinks about the consequences of sending a letter through the Post Office . The announcer then says incredulously , " You 've got a lot riding on this letter , and you 're going to turn it over to the Post Office ? Federal Express has an alternative . " Federal 's president Peter Willmott summed up the company 's marketing strategy with classic understatement : " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 're in the market . " As a counterweight to this comparative attack , at about the same time Federal Express ran an ad playing on the old science  | fiction horror film , " The Blob . " In a commercial directed to the so called " papermills of America " titled " the Paper Blob " the announcer says : " It 's coming , it 's taking over in offices coast-tocoast . It 's the paper blob . " Then there is a dramatic scene of a tidal wave of paper coming down a hallway . The announcer continues : " It 's packed with important papers that should move out of your office fast but ca n't get loose . This is a job for the Federal Express Overnight Letter . " The episode closes with papers flying off an executive 's desk on their way to Federal Express , and the announcer concludes : " You 'll never have to worry about the Paper Blob again . " It was a comic relief to the company 's guerrilla media attack on Federal 's competitors , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When the Overnight Letter program began in June , 1981 , hopes ran high throughout the company that this new product was the profit center Federal needed to propel annual revenues toward the $1 billion sales mark . But the first year 's sales of the Overnight Letter fell considerably below target . Internally , the pressure was on the Marketing Department since so much of the company 's anticipated future growth hinged on the success of the Overnight Letter . That department 's self-assessment of the situation was that the advertising had not been particularly effective , and it had not gotten the job done . Corrective measures were underway . In 1982 , Federal 's marketing executives had some serious discussions with Ally &; Gargano to get better results in 1983 . Some wanted to change agencies , but Fred Smith would n't hear of it . Since Ally &; Gargano had contributed mightily to the success of Federal Express , Smith saw no reason to pin the blame on them . The advertising campaign objective for 1983 to promote the Overnight Letter was to convince the business public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letter . Emphasis in Federal 's media offerings was on instilling in the minds of customers doubts about the quality of service of its competitors . In the 1983 business plan Federal 's marketing strategists wrote that the campaign " should demonstrate what goes wrong when someone makes a decision to use an alternative service to save money . We are defining value ' as the differential between price of the service and end results . " Federal Express is sensitive to the high-price image it has in the marketplace . Every Federal Express customer survey confirms this opinion . The company has attempted to counteract this image by convincing the public that it is offering a substantially higher value in its service and that for such service it is well worth it . Tom Oliver , Fagan 's replacement ? now senior vice president for marketing ? was asked " How effective has Federal 's media campaign been in building volume ? " Oliver responded : " We have been enormously successful but I guess you could probably over do it , if you relied solely on this strategy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motivator , Frank Maguire , was the warm-up speaker for Fred Smith at the 1981 First National Sales Meeting held for all of the company 's nationwide sales force . Maguire shouted the salutation : " Welcome fellow brothers and sisters from across the country . " Then with all the fervor of a crusading evangelist he gave them some of that old time Federal Express religion , and this group of young men and women were spellbound . Backed up by a theatrical set worthy of a Wink Martindale TIC-TACDOUGH special , and equipped with a lapel microphone , Maguire paced up and down the aisles stopping now here , now there to single out one wide-eyed salesman after another , saying ? as if to that one only : " You have the best job in the world ! Nothing we do is trivial ! Everything we do has to do with life and death ! We have the ability to be open with each other ! Openness . . . that 's what we have . We tell it like it is ! You are n't ordinary people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for you ! Not only are you the best , but you carry with you credibility and openness ! The first foundation stone you must deal with is credibility . Do n't promise the customer more than you can deliver . . . ! " Although this motivation performance lasted 15 minutes , the youthful sales representatives gave Maguire a standing ovation . A veteran officer standing along side of me said cynically in a side remark : " You do n't believe that bull shit and I do n't , but these young people believe it because they want to believe it . "  | Be that as it may , these 150 salespeople were obviously proud to be part of Federal Express . Since none of them were around in 1972 or 1973 when the company started operations , they did not have the camaraderie which those early Federal employees developed through several years of facing adversity and occasionally what seemed to be imminent disaster . Yet , as if by contagion , this apple bright sales force ? which in their All-American good looks could just have easily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had acquired the same spirit which the company pioneers carried with them . This company spirit and loyalty is certainly not an exclusive phenomenon with Federal Express . Maguire 's audience could just have easily have been employees and managers of IBM , Delta Airlines , Xerox , 3M , Marriott Corporation , Eastman Kodak , Procter &; Gamble , Mary Kay Cosmetics , or any one of a dozen other consumer products or service companies . What Federal had done was to copy what it considered to be successful motivational techniques and slogans used by other aggressive companies . But to this Fred Smith has also added his motivational experience as a Marine Corps officer , almost as if he were trying to make them all into first class " Leathernecks . " It was obvious the company was communicating its broad corporate philosophy and goals to a pliant and receptive audience . Federal 's communications with its employees all relay much the same message . The company spends considerable staff time and funds to convince them that they are part of a dynamic corporation which cares about each one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " used by James A. Perkins ? personnel head and the company 's highest ranked black employee ? was taken from a song by soul singer Sister Sledge which was widely publicized when Willie Stargell of the Pittsburgh Pirates used it to describe the team 's unity in its 1979 pennant drive . The Federal Express employees are told continually that their personal welfare and the company 's are inextricably the same . Keeping morale high on a continual basis is a difficult challenge for any organization . Federal Express , which has now advanced considerably beyond its startup phase of development , has been concerned that employee motivation and morale could slip quickly unless vigilance is maintained at all levels . The " no layoff policy " is one of the decisions Smith made to convince employees that the company will take care of them unless a major financial catastrophe occurs . This is one of several major company commitments Smith has made to keep employees productive and morale high . Productivity enhancement has become a major priority item . Better training and supervision have been stressed . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employee training . Management is convinced that if the company is to maintain its competitive lead and keep its profit margins high , it must demand  | greater employee efficiency and must derive better utilization from its aircraft fleet and its ground support facilities . Employee relations is an extremely sensitive subject . The overworked company slogan , " Work Smarter , Not Harder , " is brief and believable ; and it probably describes best management 's employee philosophy . To remain the industry leader , the company has to find ways to enhance employee productivity without creating the type of pressure to perform which might create arbitrary and exploitive management styles . There will be a need to fully understand both positive and negative employee reactions to management decisions affecting the mass of employees . As one courier in New York confided to me forcefully : " The way to motivate us is through wages and benefits . If Fred Smith does n't give us what UPS and Emery pay their drivers , many of us will be gone . That We Are Family ' crap works as long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adamant on the subject of union organization of Federal Express employees . He does not want unions because he feels they serve no purpose . His labor relations strategy has been a close monitoring of rank-and-file employees to prevent any situations which might precipitate union organizing activity . He has always been concerned , as Perkins once said at a Family Briefing , that " the Teamsters are out there lurking in the woodwork somewhere . " A confidant of Smith says , " Go in and tell Fred that while you were waiting in the lobby to see him , you were sitting next to Norman Greene , director of the Airline Division of the Teamsters . Watch Fred come apart ! " Unionization was a threat in some of the company 's work groups in the early years . Fred Smith fought the organizational attempts and won . He argued that the flexibility the company needed in order to survive would be seriously impeded if unions got control . Smith told employees he could not pay them more because the company lingered on the border of bankruptcy . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on more than one occasion was a little nudge , and it would have been out of business . Smith feared unions would seize control of the work rules , and he would argue : " Drivers at 10:20 a.m. probably would not have the incentive to get those last six packages delivered before the 10:30 a.m. deadline as the company had committed to do . Any strike would be a disaster to us . " An aide of Smith says jokingly , " Fred could n't deal with union officials . This is his company . He 's too autocratic . He 's the massah of the great Federal Express plantation . " There was really nothing original about Fred Smith 's basic objection that a union would dictate the work rules . This has been the fear of many companies trying to fend off unionization . Federal has never had a work stoppage . No employees in Memphis or in its field operations are represented by unions , though most of the employees of the competition are unionized . The Teamsters represent the majority of employees at United Parcel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
