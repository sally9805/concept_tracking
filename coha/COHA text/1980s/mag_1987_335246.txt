He was an academic star who by the age of 30 had produced an influential body of work on the treatment of the mentally retarded . But in the minds of some of his colleagues , there was something odd about the work of Stephen Breuning , an assistant professor of child psychiatry at the University of Pittsburgh . The results of his studies were almost too orderly , too pat , and the work was completed with remarkable speed . The doubts came to a head in 1983 when Breuning 's supervisor , Robert Sprague , then director of the Institute for Child Behavior and Development at the University of Illinois , reported his suspicions of his young colleague 's methods to the National Institute of Mental Health . <P> This month , after a painstaking 2 1/2-year investigation , a five-member senior NIMH panel charged that Breuning " knowingly , willfully , and repeatedly engaged in misleading and deceptive practices in reporting results of research . " Concluded the panel : " On the basis of all the facts , Dr. Stephen E. Breuning has engaged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the NIMH recommended that Breuning be barred for ten years from receiving any contracts or funds from the Department of Health and Human Services . It also referred its findings to the Department of Justice for possible prosecution . <P> The case is particularly disturbing , say agency officials , because the research probably had a direct impact on health policies . Between 1979 and 1984 , says Sprague , Breuning " produced one-third of the literature in the psychopharmacology of the mentally retarded . " The young psychologist began his research in the late 1970s , when treatment of the mentally retarded with powerful antipsychotic drugs , such as haloperidol and chlorpromazine , was being questioned . Breuning 's opposition to the overuse of such drugs was shared by other researchers in the field . Even so , some scientists believe Breuning went overboard in discounting the benefits for many severely disturbed patients . Says acting NIMH Director Frank Sullivan : " The retarded are vulnerable . They might have been damaged by false research . " <P> Sprague first sensed something was amiss when he told Breuning about his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the time on the severity of mentally ill patients ' symptoms . " What 's wrong with you ? " Sprague recalls one of Bruening 's co-workers saying . " We get 100% agreement . " That idle boast of scientific exactitude  --  a virtual impossibility  --  persuaded Sprague to look back through his colleague 's research and then to contact the NIMH , which had funded both Breuning 's and Sprague 's work .
