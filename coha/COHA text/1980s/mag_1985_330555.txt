In the cold reckoning of Hollywood 's moneymen , The Cotton Club was one of last Christmas ' turkeys . Despite its lavish production , a big-name director ( Francis Coppola ) and star ( Richard Gere ) and huge advance publicity , the $47 million show-biz epic was squeezed out in the scramble for holiday audiences by such hits as Beverly Hills Cop and The Flamingo Kid . <P> The crowds are lining up for The Cotton Club at last : not at movie theaters this time but at video shops across the country . Since its debut on cassette in April , only four months after opening in theaters across the country , 150,000 copies of The Cotton Club have been sold to retail outlets ( which rent and sell them , in turn , to consumers ) . The movie has spent 16 weeks on Billboard 's chart of the top video rentals , four of them in the No. 2 slot . <P> The Cotton Club is just one of a growing number of Hollywood films that are packing them in at the video @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Crimes of Passion , Ken Russell 's flamboyantly seedy sex drama , was a flop at the box office last October , but has earned nearly $3.6 million in cassette sales thus far . Dune , a big-budget bomb last Christmas , has made $7.5 million in sales to video stores and has been on Billboard 's Top 40 chart for 13 weeks . Even the most famous box-office fiasco of all , Michael Cimino 's Heaven 's Gate , has made $3 million in home video , twice as much as it earned in two abortive theatrical releases . <P> Home video 's hit parade , of course , is not made up solely of theatrical clinkers . Big box-office winners nearly always repeat their success when they appear on cassette ( usually four to six months after their theatrical debut ) . Current video chart-toppers , for example , include such 1984 hits as The Terminator and The Karate Kid . But well-publicized box-office disappointments often do nearly as well as the blockbusters . " Sometimes the best video title is a movie that has run in a number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reg Childs , president of distribution for Embassy Home Entertainment . " There are more people who have heard of it but have n't seen it . " <P> An occasional moviegoer , in addition , is more likely to take a chance on a marginal film if it means simply plunking down $2 or $3 to rent a cassette . " It 's much easier to rent a movie you 're not sure about and turn it off if you do n't like it , " says Amy Misner , 33 , who regularly picks up cassettes for her family in Atlanta . " It takes a little more resolve to walk out on a movie when you 've spent $16 for four people . " Renting tapes , however , also takes resolve . The lines at the cash register on Friday and Saturday nights have become almost as oppressive as those at the local fourplex . Some newer video stores , like New York City 's Cine Club Video , are trying to expedite matters by charging one hefty monthly fee in return for virtually unlimited rentals . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
