Reagan seized the power of the purse-but can he hold it ? <P> Battles of the budget , which once were seasonal struggles , have turned into a form of unending siege warfare in which rounds are fired almost every day . Congressional recesses and even presidential holidays are no longer exempted , as Ronald Reagan demonstrated last week . <P> " I 'm kind of enthused , " said the vacationing President , while signing 35 bills at the Century Plaza Hotel in Beverly Hills , Calif . Among them were two that formalized notable White House victories over Congress : a $200 billion defense spending bill and an $11.6 billion foreign aid appropriation , which will give the Executive Branch new flexibility to direct both military and development assistance . But that did not quite end the battle over expenditures for fiscal 1982 , which began Oct. 1 ; large portions of the Federal Government are still being financed under a " continuing resolution " that expires March 31 . <P> Meanwhile , skirmishing over the budget for fiscal 1983 has already begun . The President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spending proposals he will present to Congress next month . The cuts would mainly affect social programs-Medicare , Medicaid , food stamps , school lunches , subsidized housing , urban renewal grants-that have already been slashed . Even so , the projected deficit would swell to well over $100 billion unless Reagan also agrees to some so-called revenue enhancements , and he has indicated that he might . In a year-end interview with reporters that was released last week , Reagan repeated his general opposition to tax boosts , but hinted that he could make an exception for higher excise taxes on alcohol , tobacco and gasoline . <P> Notably absent from all this activity was any hint that the budget might be shaped primarily by Congress , as it was in the late 1970s . In a significant political coup , Reagan last year overrode legislative machinery that Congress had designed specifically to give itself permanent control of the budget process . For the moment at least , dazed lawmakers will have to accept , reject or amend presidential proposals rather than enact their own . The President 's triumph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that has gone on since the founding days of the Republic , even though Article I of the Constitution theoretically gives Congress primary power over the federal purse . The first Congresses appropriated lump sums that Presidents George Washington and John Adams and their Cabinets could spend as they wished . Later legislatures captured effective control of federal finances , but the pendulum swung back to the White House under a succession of strong-willed modern Presidents , beginning with Franklin D. Roosevelt . The Nixon Administration haughtily proclaimed that congressional appropriations gave it mere " options " as to how much to spend for what . Provoked by such arrogance , Congress passed the Budget Act of 1974 , which is still in effect .
