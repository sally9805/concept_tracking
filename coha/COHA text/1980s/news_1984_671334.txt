The most recent evidence , while it by no means ends the debate , sheds light on several important aspects of the issue : what the fantasies say about one ' s sexual orientation , what the most common fantasies are , when they are healthy and when pathological and what they indicate about a couple ' s relationship . The latest contribution to the issue is from the Masters and Johnson Institute in a recent article on their treatment program for dissatisfied homosexuals . Researchers at the institute believe that whether a person has homosexual fantasies or heterosexual ones can not be used as an indication of actual sexual preference . They cite evidence showing the frequency of homosexual fantasies among heterosexuals and heterosexual ones among homosexuals. // In the current issue of The American Journal of Psychiatry , Mark Schwartz and William Masters report a survey of 120 men and women , half of them homosexual and half heterosexual , showing that people ' s sexual fantasies can be at odds with their sexual orientation . Among both men and women who are homosexual , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sexual fantasy . For heterosexual men and women , homosexual encounters rank fourth and fifth most common , respectively . Among heterosexual men and women , the most common fantasy involved replacement of their usual partners. // People tend to be selective in their recall of their own fantasies . To get a full record , David Barlow , director of the Sexuality Research Program at the State University of New York at Albany , asked people to carefully monitor their fantasies for several weeks. // " We find , " he said in an interview , " most people have about seven or eight fantasies a day , although the range can be from none to 40 and up. " // " Among heterosexuals about three- quarters of fantasies are of ' normal ' lovemaking , and about 25 percent are sexual variations - sadomasochism , homosexuality , group sex and the like , " he said . " The normal pattern of sex fantasies includes a certain amount of unusual sex. " // Dr. Schwartz and Dr. Masters report a similar variety of sex fantasies in the people they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were the fifth most common among both homosexual and heterosexual men , while fantasies of forced sexual encounters were first among homosexual women and second among heterosexual women . For heterosexual men and women , ob serving other people ' s sexual encounters was the third most common fantasy. // Extrapolating from Dr. Barlow ' s data to the lists reported by Dr. Schwartz and Dr. Masters , the fantasies at the top of the lists were by far more frequent than those at the bottom. // While the content of a sexual fantasy does not make it abnormal , its frequency can indicate a psychological problem . Dr. Barlow reported that in people with psychiatric problems , such as rapists and child molesters , the frequency of fantasies is extremely high , often a constant obsession throughout the day. // How much does the actual content of a fantasy matter ? Many sex therapists argue that it does not matter much as long as it proves useful for a couple in lovemaking. // Dr. Schwartz , for six years director of research at the Masters and Johnson Institute and now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an interview : " If a man loses his arousal while making love with his wife , and uses a fantasy to get it back , then lets go of the fantasy to focus on the lovemaking again , it ' s irrelevant what the fantasy is about . It ' s a helpful bridge back to making love , and increases the couple ' s intimacy. " // " But if he keeps the fantasy in mind all during their lovemaking , it can increase the distance between the partners rather than bring them closer , " he said. // Bernard Apfelbaum , director of the Berkeley Sex Therapy Group , said , " It ' s important to look at the content of a sex fantasy during lovemaking for what it suggests about what ' s missing in the sexual encounter. " // " For example , " he said , " a man may say that while making love with his wife he had a fantasy of Raquel Welch in a bikini . On closer scrutiny , what is important in the fantasy is Raquel Welch ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uncritical , accepting . That ' s really a message about what he ' s missing from his wife . That ' s material to use in therapy for the couple. " // " A sex fantasy can be a clinical barometer of the difficulties a person has with intimacy and emotional closeness , " Dr. Schwartz said . About a third of women have had a history of some kind of sexual trauma , he said , and as a result , during lovemaking they may dissociate , separating their feelings from their acts . This sometimes takes the form of a sex fantasy that creates a psychological distance from their partner. // <> <> Problems With Intimacy // " Sex fantasies , " Dr. Schwartz said , " can reveal such problems with intimacy . For instance , during lovemaking with his wife , a man ' s fantasies could range from imagining his wife , to fantasies about his secretary , to watching someone else make love , to the sort of impersonal sex that ' s in porno movies . Each of those fantasies along the gradient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The danger , " Dr. Schwartz added , " is when people use a fantasy to maintain or increase the distance between them . After 30 years of marriage , a man or woman may replace the spouse with someone else in their fantasies . If he or she has to fantasize someone else while making love , then the relationship needs help . " <> <> Other sex therapists do not agree that such fantasies necessarily indicate that a couple is in need of therapy . " If a man fantasizes about his secretary after 20 years of marriage , that ' s not at all uncommon , " Dr. Barlow said . He , like many other sex therapists , believes that , if a 20-year fantasy helps in lovemaking , then there is no harm in it. // Nor does he believe that fantasies are always acted out . " It is not uncommon for a woman to tell us that she can get aroused by an attractive woman , although she would never want to have sexual relations with a woman . " And by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fantasy of a forced sexual encounter , such as rape , does not mean that a person would necessarily enjoy acting it out in real life , although it ranked as the first or second most common fantasy among all groups. // " For most people who have a fantasy of rape , " Dr. Barlow said , " it ' s a very idealized , even romantic act , something like the rape scene in ' The Fantastiks , ' " perhaps somewhat stylized and removed . " In our research , we find that if you play a tape for them of a realistic description of a real rape , with all its pain and violence , they don ' t get aroused . The meaning of a fantasy like that may be more symbolic than real ; for many women who have guilt about sex , it can be a way of giving themselves permission to enjoy it. " // <> <> Some Fantasies Reveal Troubles // " But if , say , a man has to have a fantasy of severe sadism before he can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem , " Dr. Barlow said . " Such a habit of compulsive , obligatory fantasies are more likely to lead to someone trying to act them out . And that can mean trouble. " // " If the fantasy is something like a role reversal or cross-dressing , and the wife is sympathetic , then it ' s fine , " he continued . " But if acting out the fantasy brings harm to others , as with rape fantasies , then it ' s a problem . Or if the fantasy is of something like transvestism , and the wife is not accepting , then the person has to decide between his sexual preference and his marriage. " // " When we treat someone like that , " he said , " we don ' t consider them cured until the fantasy changes to a more desirable one . You have to look both at their behavior and their fantasies. " // " Fantasy patterns , " Dr. Barlow said , " are a primary indicator of a person ' s sexual orientation . " He thus places himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of , say , homosexual fantasies is a prime indication that a person wishes to be homosexual or is one. // However , that view is at odds with the recent report from the Masters and Johnson Institute . Dr. Schwartz and Dr. Masters argue that having a given fantasy - even with some frequency - does not define a person ' s sexual orientation ; for example , having homosexual fantasies does not mean that a person is homosexual . <> <> Fantasy May Not Show Preference <> <> Instead , they argue , a person ' s stated sexual preference matters more . Thus , even if a person had homosexual experiences in the past and fantasized about them , but preferred heterosexual partners , he should be considered a heterosexual . The implication for therapy is that , for such a person , it would be appropriate to use sex therapy to change his sex life and fantasy patterns to fit his preference. // The institute takes the position that a person ' s previous sexual experiences and fantasies do not dictate his sexual orientation in an unalterable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that although many men have had some homosexual experiences , most later settle into a firm heterosexual preference. // Only homosexuals who are distressed by their sexual orientation are given a psychiatric diagnosis and considered in need of therapy. // " In our therapy program , " Dr. Schwartz said , " we try to change the person ' s sexual behavior . When that changes , the fantasy change will follow . For example , a homosexual man may be dissatisfied with the shallowness of his relationships with his male lovers , and decide he wants to be with a woman . If he forms an intimate sexual relationship with a woman , his fantasy pattern will change. " // The Masters and Johnson approach to fantasy is in stark contrast to the psychoanalytic view , in which fantasies are even more important than actual behavior in determining a person ' s true sexual orientation. // In a paper given at the December meeting of the American Psychoanalytic Association , Dr. Richard Isay contended that a person who has homosexual fantasies , but does not actively engage in homosexual activity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unconscious. // " What one does is not necessarily what one is , " Dr. Isay said in an interview . " It ' s quite possible that those patients who changed their sexual behavior to a heterosexual pattern through the Masters and Johnson program did not change their deepest fantasies or their true preference . They may have gone through the change just because of social pressures , or even to please the therapist. " // " A therapist ignores the patient ' s fantasy life at great risk , " Dr. Isay continued . " If you induce a patient to change his sexual behavior , but ignore his fantasies , you risk leaving him socially stranded in a marriage he won ' t want , or his becoming severely depressed . If the change produces no problems in the long run , then the patient was probably not really a homosexual in the first place . But a therapist can ' t make that judgment without taking his fantasies into account. " // The dispute about sexual fantasies is likely to continue until more and better scientific data @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr. Schwartz said , " is that we have very , very little good research about people ' s sexual fantasies . If you base your conclusions on a sample of volunteers , they are self- selected and the results are biased . If you ask a random sample , people lie a lot . And a clinical population just is not representative. " // " Our knowledge of sexual fantasies is about where our data on masturbation was 50 years ago , pre-Kinsey , " he said . " We don ' t really know what the usual , normal pattern looks like . There are probably large numbers of people who think they ' re abnormal , but as we get better data , we ' ll probably find that the normal range of people ' s fantasies is even more diverse than we realize now.
