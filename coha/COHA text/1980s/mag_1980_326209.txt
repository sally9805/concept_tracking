THE SOUL OF THE WOLF by Michael Fox <P> Little , Brown ; 131 pages ; $12.95 <P> Wolves used to slaver a lot . They hung around outside European villages to gobble up grandmothers . They trailed troikas across the frozen steppes , waiting for some tender Muscovite to be tossed their way . They howled through the Canadian wilderness on the heels of succulent trappers lost in the snow . All that has changed . Now wolves are seen as benign and useful citizens of the ecosystem . They protect nature 's delicate balance by keeping down those troublesome caribou herds and even practice birth control . Wolves do still howl , of course , but , as Michael Fox reassuringly points out , this is often to express " their unity and kinship through song . " <P> Fox , 43 , is a psychologist and ethologist , and a leader in the growing pack of natural scientists who have lately given wolves a good name . He has been raising wolves and studying them for years . In earlier books like Behavior of Wolves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Soul of the Wolf is something else , an illustrated valentine to Fox 's four-footed friends , and a moral message for another endangered species , man . The valentine is marvelous , the exhortation overblown . By learning about wolves , Fox insists , man can learn about the mysterious intricacies of nature , and thus be encouraged to cease his depredations . In some ways , Fox avers , the world would be a better place to live in if people behaved more like wolves . <P> More like wolves ? Yes indeed . Take sex , for instance . Wolf couples , writes Fox , " enjoy mutual love and affiliation without year-round conflicts over and desire for sex . " Unlike men and women ( and male dogs ) , who are highly promiscuous and make love more or less all the year round , wolves , both male and female , breed only once a year , though they have a longish courtship period when the male brings the female good things to eat , sticks to play with , and may , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breed at nine months of age . Wolves wait until they are two or even three years old . Meanwhile they do the work of the pack , most notably helping care for other wolves ' pups , in what Fox calls " a time of apprenticeship and service to their society . " In any pack , however , unless its ranks have been seriously depleted , only one female each year gives birth to a litter . Even more notable , some studies suggest , the alpha male ( or executive wolf ) , who makes all pack decisions and conducts the hunt , tends not to breed-perhaps because it would distract him from command . Says Fox primly : Man needs to " emulate the wolf ... in exercising greater dominion over sexuality and incredible reproductive potential . " <P> Wolves are killers . Precisely because of that , says Fox , they seem to be at pains to avoid killing one another . Within the pack this takes the form of ritual challenge and acts of subservience , plus carefully pursued systems of personal rights . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When they hunt near the border of another pack 's range , they howl out early warning systems so there will be no inadvertent confrontation . And they leave buffer zones between territories , not merely to keep the peace , but to provide safety areas where deer are allowed to breed .
