Among TIME 's 31 million readers worldwide is an influential , highly educated professional woman who would be a valuable addition to any magazine 's demographic profile : Raisa Maximovna Gorbachev , the focus of this week 's cover stories on Soviet women . During the Washington summit last December , Mrs. Gorbachev spotted TIME Correspondent Nancy Traver , who spent 3 1/2 years as a journalist in Moscow and who speaks Russian , at a meeting in the Soviet embassy that was closed to the press . Mrs. Gorbachev took her hand , pulled her alongside and said there was nothing wrong with having an American reporter in - the room . " The American and Soviet press should work together to build peace , " she said . The Soviet First Lady reported that she received TIME and read it regularly . Mrs. Gorbachev is not only a reader but now also a published contributor . When she learned the magazine was preparing a story on Soviet women , she sent the editors a letter on the subject , which is printed in this issue . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was done by Moscow Correspondent Ann Blackman . From observing the reactions of Moscow friends who visit her comparatively grand apartment , she knew how difficult many Soviet women have it at home . " The kitchen is n't exceptional by American standards , " Blackman reports . " But the Soviet women are amazed to see a dishwasher , a toaster and a Cuisinart . " Soviet men are bemused at the sight of her husband , Associated Press Moscow Bureau Chief Michael Putzel , helping in the kitchen . <P> The story on Soviet women was written by Associate Editor Jill Smolowe , who was struck by the difference in attitudes between East and West . " Soviet women seem largely undisturbed by issues of power , self-worth and recognition , " says Smolowe . " They simply endure . " Still , their prospects have improved dramatically under Gorbachev , notes Reporter-Researcher Sally B. Donnelly , who saw the plight of Soviet women while she was a student at the State Pedagogical Institute in Leningrad . " Today Soviet women are earning higher salaries , and some are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them more time for family responsibilities , " says Donnelly . " I think Gorbachev realizes that women are crucial to his economic reforms . " Soviet women , including a certain TIME reader we know , probably could n't agree more .
