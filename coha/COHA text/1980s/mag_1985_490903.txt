THE TALK OF THE TOWN Notes arid Comment " 1 EAR reader , " begins a letter we received from a news magazine the other day , which goes on to describe us as skeptical and independent-minded and the sort of person who would make a good subscriber . It arrived in the same batch of mail as a letter from a food magazine which tells us we are a person who wants to fully savor the best that life has to offer . We lead an active and busy life , the second letter says , and so the food folks understand why we overlooked a previous subscription offer from them . They and the news people hope that we , a reader who is clearly a cut above the average , will mail in their postcards to receive free copies at no obligation . Sometimes we think that we are skeptical , and then a doting publisher writes to us and we savor it fully . We like to be sweet-talked and be someone 's dear reader . These days , readers are dear . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office one day a few weeks ago to say goodbye on her way to a job in a small town where nobody knows her . For two weeks , she said , she would be teaching songwriting and singing to schoolchildren and living in a room in a motel , and when she mentioned that she had nothing to read we jumped right up and looked at our bookshelves . We imagined her , on a winter evening , reclining on a burnt-orange bedspread in a room with dark-brown carpeting and a view of a parking lot and dumpster , and tried to pick writers who would be good company for her and make her motel hours seem like minutes and bring her happily to where she could snap off the light and lay her lovely head on the pillow and go to sleep . As an affectionate librarian , seeing one sweet reader alone at night in a room that offers her only a television screen for company , we approached literature in quite a different way from the way we approached it when we were in school and wrote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We chose books for her simply by their covers , regardless of other merits , picking covers that we remembered holding in our hands for hours at a stretch , and sent her off with an armload , and now we think of her again . She has moved on to another school , a different motel . One of those hooks made us laugh out loud when we read it  --  not little nasal laughs but the major , structural laughs that take a reader down to the mat  --  and we hope it is tossing her around , too . Thinking of her , we naturally think of you , dear reader , holding in your hands this magazine with the familiar Rea Irvin cover that marks our anniversary , the old gent raising his eyeglass for another look at the butterfly he has studied for sixty years . We are fond of this drawing , the oldest in our collection , though we do n't claim to understand it . Mr. Tilley , as he is known , is of another age entirely  --  the late eighteenth century @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harold Ross chose an antique to grace his jazzy new magazine in 1925 we leave it to others to decide . As we contemplate Mr. Tilley this week , we think of his near-contemporaries Mr. Fielding , Mr. Sterne , and other eighteenth-century novelists , and of the young Charles Dickens  --  writers who in the course of a story often stepped out from the prose proscenium and addressed the reader directly , as " dear reader " or " sensible reader , " to expand upon the story or draw the dear reader 's attention to this or that . All fiction began as letter-writing ( we learned this somewhere ; do n't ask us where ) , and so those old masters felt quite comfortable in speaking directly to the customer . Mr. Fielding begins " Tom Jones , " " An author ought to consider himself , not as a gentleman who gives a private or eleemosynary treat , but rather as one who keeps a public ordinary , at which all persons are welcome for their money . " Squire Allworthy and his sister Bridget are then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ author pokes his head out . " Reader , I think proper , before we proceed any farther together , to acquaint thee , that I intend to digress , through this whole history , as often as I see occasion , of which I am myself a better judge than any pitiful critic whatever , " Fielding says , and he tells the critics to mind their own business , and not meddle in things they know nothing about , such as his book . We and all our friends are of a post-Tilley era : writers here keep their heads in , and the proprietor of the shop does n't jump out on page 2 and holler , " Yowsa , yowsa , yowsa , have we got an issue for you ! " Our reticence implies no lack of affection , however . " All sorts of pleasant and intelligent people read my books , " John Cheever said long ago in an interview . " I do n't know who they are , but they are marvellous and seem to live quite independently of the prejudices of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The room where I work has a window looking into a wood , and I like to think that these earnest , lovable , and mysterious readers are in there . " Our window looks into a narrow , crowded street , and we like to think that you , earnest and lovable and mysterious reader , if you are down there , will be extremely careful walking across it . Dear reader ! Our regards to you . We roll this sheet of yellow copy paper from the carriage and raise it to your health . Other Magazines E. . , PICARD , an artist and writer born in Strasbourg , went to Berlin in 1919 to marry . " My so-called lover was a man I had seen only in his field-gray uniform . When I saw him in his civilian outfit , I fell out of love at this moment . The glamour was gone . " Still , she married him and stayed in Berlin , working for the cultural pages of several newspapers , and hanging out at the Caf ? des Westens on the Ku-Damm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It goes from the church you always see in the postcards . " The Cate des Westens revolved around Red Richard , a hunchback and a vice lord ; elsewhere , the GrOssenwahr were ascendant . " That means people who think they are Nietzsche but they are not , and who think they are Wagner but really are n't very good . " Berlin throbbed anyway . " Everything in New York today is nothing but a copy of this time in Berlin , between 1919 and the early nineteen-thirties  --  there was freedom , liberty , you could do what you wanted as an artist . " A small magazine , Der Querschnitt ( The Cross-Section ) , run by Alfred Flechtheim , Berlin 's principal art dealer , stood at the center of things cultural then . " They published Werfel , the famous Expressionist poet  --  people like that . I adored those people , " Mrs. Picard said . We met Mrs. Picard , now eighty-five ( " I 'm always as old as the year , so I ca n't lie . I 'm very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at a recent party in the East Village marking the first issue of a new magazine , vaguely inspired by Der Querschnitt but transoceanic in its aims . New York-Berlin , or NYB , will publish articles and poems and photographs and drawings by American and German writers and artists ; some of the writing is in both languages , some in one or the other . " There 's a lot going on in Berlin that American artists want to know FEBRUARY 25,1985 about , " said the magazine 's New York editor , Charles Austin . " There 's a lot more installation work there  --  one man just taped the sounds of Cologne 's train station and then went and played them in the ruins of Berlin 's old station . There 's stuff happening . Even though the whole Neo-Expressionist thing came out of Cologne and Berlin , they 're moving now into the nonobjective . " And what about Berlin artists ? What do they wish to know of New York ? " Quite frankly , " said Pat Oleszko , a tall New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which she had attached hundreds of pairs of dice , and who had just returned from Germany , " people in Berlin are interested in how much money they can make in our art scene . " The first issue of the magazine sold out in Berlin and has gone to a second printing . Mrs. Picard fled to New York before the Second World War and returned to Berlin in 1952 . " Very little of the cultural scene was left , but slowly again it became the artists ' center , " she told us . She has continued to commute across the Atlantic , writing ( she has an essay on garbage in the first issue of NYB ) and performing . " My favorite performance  --  I did it in the early seventies , and in my early seventies , in both New York ( at the Cafe au Go Go ) and Berlin  --  I stayed in bed the whole time . See , I had this electric bed , which you can push a button on and the feet and the back go up and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything , and put on about fifty scarves , wrapping them all over me  --  such a big head I had . I was a real mummy . And then I 'd start peeling them off . And all the time the bed was going up and down , and I 'd he talking into the microphone about my views on the world . And , finally , everyone thought I had taken all my clothes off . I had n't ; I still had my black leotard on . But everyone applauded a lot anyway , in both New York and Berlin . " ? WE went to a party last Tuesday at the Waldorf marking the forTHE NEW YORKER tieth anniversary of Guideposts , a journal with a circulation that tops four million , which was founded by Dr. Norman Vincent Peale . Each month , Guideposts features inspiring stories of people who have walked up to adversity and kicked it . We talked to a man who was told by doctors he would die of cancer but recovered , and a man who dived under a subway train @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dived into an icy lake to rescue a boy ; all their stories had been told in Guideposts in the years since it started publication  --  with a four-page story by the aviator Eddie Rickenbacker about , among other things , the time his plane crashed and he drifted through the South Pacific on a rubber raft for twenty-one days . " Other religious magazines come out and preach to people , " said William Deerfield , an associate editor of the magazine . " They give them the same stuff they hear on Sundays . But we tell the stories of ordinary Joes , and people can relate to that . An interesting thing , though , is that Guideposts did n't work very well in England . Presumably , people there are more reserved  --  they do n't want to talk about their troubles . " In this country , the magazine grew steadily through 1975 and then really took off , doubling its circulation in the last decade despite the New Weariness . The editors had long thought of themselves as writing for the lonely travelling salesman , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Over half our readers have been to college , " said Mary Ann O'Roark , one of the magazine 's senior editors . " The readers ' average age is fifty-one , and they have a family income of twenty-three thousand dollars " ? near the national average . And , for the most part , they are happy . " According to a lot of what you pick up today in books and movies , people 's lives are all racked up , " Ms. O'Roark said . " What our readers tell us is that sure they have problems , but their lives are filled with joy and contentment and satisfaction and happiness . " Dr. Peale , the author of " The Power of Positive Thinking " ( he threw out the manuscript of the book , because he thought it was n't good enough , but his wife rescued it ) , is a short , friendly man with an Ohio drawl who wears a Rotary pin in his lapel . He had eaten dinner at the White House the night before , with the President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I told Yogi I 'm an old Brooklyn Dodgers fan but as long as I was sitting by him I loved the Yankees , " said Dr. Peale , who stepped down last fall as the preacher at Marble Collegiate Church , on Fifth Avenue , after half a century in the pulpit . " To he a pastor of a church , you have to come up with a brand-new speech forty or fifty times a year  --  that 's more than any politician , " he told us in explanation . " And , anyway , I get enough speaking of other kinds done . I give about three addresses a week . A week or two ago , it was the National Association of Secondary School Principals  --  they had about sixty-five hundred in New Orleans  --  and then four thousand ranchers in Montana , and then I was someplace else .

I think we 've been handed this belief that everything is going to pieces . It 's just a stylism , I think , and it 's worn out , pass ? . " Hitting Father 4l'crrE : " Strange Interlude , " the impassioned nine-act drama by Eugene O'Neill , had seen only two major productions since its Pulitzer Prize-winning appearance in 1928 until it was revived last year at the Duke of York 's Theatre , in London 's West End . That highly acclaimed production starred Glenda Jackson in the role of Nina Leeds , a woman whose life and entanglements with three men the play follows over twenty-five years . Miss Jackson opens in the play this week on Broadway , at the Nederlander Theatre . By an unusual arrangement with American Equity , she brings with her the three British actors who played her leading men in London . ( " I said I would n't come if they could n't come , " she says , quite simply . ) THE SCENE : The Michael Chekhov Studio , a loftlike room on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Folding metal chairs . A coatrack . A stage manager 's table , loaded with scripts and plastic-foam cups . ACT I : Charley Lang , a blond-haired young American actor in a red T-shirt , is standing alone at the end of the room which serves as the stage . Sometimes he frowns slightly and puts his finger to his mouth as he focusses on the director 's murmured instructions and projects himself into the mind of the character he plays  --  Nina 's son Gordon , a grown youth just engaged to be married . He stops and starts his monologue on command of the director , Keith Hack  --  a sparsely bearded , bespectacled , intellectual-looking Englishman , dressed in the style of Woody Allen . Hack has taken off his heavy snow hoots and is conducting the rehearsal in his socks . From a chair in the wings  --  against the wall  --  Glenda Jackson looks on , and beside her sits Brian Cox , a handsome , dark-haired Scotsman , running slightly to flesh , who is cast in the role of Nina 's former @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  on a pale , shiny , naked face  --  a look of almost ferocious intelligence and purpose . At a cue , Miss Jackson and Cox rise from their chairs ( pushing off in unison , like race horses from the starting gate ) and cross to join Lang onstage . His performance , like the performances of his fellow-American newcomers to the team , must blend with that of the original British quartet . " And then I say , Tor God 's sake ... you do n't know what you 're doing : you 're hitting your father , ' " Miss Jackson says , in a flat , workaday tone . Lang-Gordon bridles at Cox-Darrell in mounting rage , strikes him on the face . ( Hearty theatrical smacking sound . ) Cox-Darrell tumbles and sprawls some feet away from mother and son . " For God 's sake ! . . . You do n't know what you 're doing ! You 're hitting your father ! " Miss Jackson-Nina says , in a tone that is very far from workaday . Flack intervenes .

Cox gets up , looking rueful , rubs his elbow , ambles to the table , accepts a proffered peppermint . Enter stage right , unobserved by mother , lover , and son as they resume the perennial tragedy of family affections , a stranger . A shortish man in his sixties , wearing a naval-officer's-style duffel coat ( as if for a Pinewood Studio 's battleship bridge ) , a vaguely Holmesian checked hat , and a character actor 's mustache . He is Heywood Hale Broun , onetime actor ; well-known raconteur ; author of a 1983 memoir of his father , the famous newspaperman and drama critic Heywood Broun , and his mother , the noted critic and reporter Ruth Hale Broun ; and critic-at-large of the CBS television program " Sunday Morning . " Composedly , he sits down to await the lunch break , his cue to interview the cast . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Darrell were in love with each other , " Lang-Gordon is saying to his mother . " I hated the idea on Father 's account . That 's only natural , is n't it ? " Hack has been sitting with a tin of tobacco and cigarette papers on his knee , thoughtfully rolling himself a cigarette . He looks up and says , gently , to the young actor , " Gordon 's just learned that wonderful thing  --  about not making easy judgments about people 's moral behavior , because it 's always infinitely more complex than you think . " ACT II : Miss Jackson and Braun are sitting in two chairs onstage , in the glow of television lighting . Broun has told some anecdotes of his theatrical career . He has quoted from Edmund Kean , and from Cyrano de Bergerac in the original French . He has told Miss Jackson about his family and referred to it as " the oldest and least distinguished theatrical family in America .

" This play , so experimental in its day , was O'Neill 's rejection of the kind of work his father had done , " Miss Jackson says . " It is an extraordinary piece of writing about the changes that go on in the human animal under stress . He was trying to show that feelings can change , second by second . " " Banned in Boston , in its day , " Broun says , with a dramatic gesture . " Is the play still shocking ? " he asks . ( Abortion as well as fidelity and paternity is among its dramatic themes . ) " Not shocking , " Miss Jackson says firmly . " But telling .

" Ah , yes , reacting , " Broun says , in his characteristically self-mocking , nasal singsong . He gives a brief , sparkling cameo performance of a person listening to another with interest : eyebrows moving up and down , head cocked this way and that . The lights go down . Exit Miss Jackson . Exit Broun . Huggaland EST week , we dropped in at the Eighty-second Annual American International Toy Fair . " Your basic human-type goodness is the hottest concept here , and Kenner is leading the way , " said a happy young woman , one of what seemed to be hundreds of public-relations or marketing representatives available to steer visitors around the merchandise displayed at the fair , which was held in and around the Toy Center , at Twenty-third Street .

The product is unique and is spreading the joy of hugging and showing of emotions . We can tell already that Hugga Bunch in 1985 is going to be bigger than Care Bears in 1984 , when we did its second year two hundred million dollars plus . " " Care Bearsi " we asked .
