Terror seems to be an invention of the bourgeoisie . The word was actually coined by the bourgeoisie when it was still unaware of itself , to designate a particular period of the French Revolution , and the uses of terror seem to he linked to one of the principal characteristics of the bourgeois era : the unstable nature of values . With the Revolution of ' 89 , the bourgeois world , a materialistic world firmly bound to duration , that is , to the passage of time , superseded the feudal world , a world completely alienated from and immovably situated outside of time . If nothing stands still , then everything ? opinions , styles , information , fortunes , success , groups , society falls victim to continuous change . Snob-bery comes to stand as the fickle and arbitrary surrogate of good taste , which is based no longer on the canon of the beautiful but on that of fashion , of whatever is in vogue . The beautiful is what goes over , not what is beautiful . The movement in time that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the verb " to go over . " In fact , this social and cultural terror is the terror of not being up-to-date , of being behind , of being on the way out . Terror has two faces : it is a feeling of inferiority in the one who fears not being up-to-date , and it is a feeling of superiority in the one who asserts that he is up-to-date and accuses his adversary of being irrelevant . Why is one not up-to-date ? Because one has " old " ideas , because one is " obsolete , " because one has remained " behind . " It is noteworthy that the words " old , " " obsolete , " " behind " suggest movement in time , referring to age ( " old " ) , or to the present state of affairs ( " obsolete " ) , or to distance ( " behind " ) . The shout of " down with tradition " summarizes terror in the artistic field ; that of " pas d'ennemi a gauche " summarizes terror in the political field . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stable values . It is connected to the idea of progress ; but , one should note , a progress that has nothing to do with the concept of improvement , but only with that of ESSAY 37 movement in time . One idea , one man , one group are in progress to the degree to which they are moving , not to the degree to which they are improving . Thus it is a question of progress in the strict sense of the word ; and it matters little if this progress is downward instead of upward , toward decadence instead of toward renewal . From all this one could argue with reason that terror is based upon the supposition that ideas count for less than their movements through time , up and down along the scale of possible values . For example , the idea of fatherland has been held in very high regard in certain epochs and in very low regard in others . But it is not the fatherland as a sentimental and ideological reality that is going up and down but rather the opinion one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opinion leaves the value of fatherland intact ; in effect , it is not discussed or transformed or renewed . One is limited to shifting it along the scale of values on the basis of obscure motives that , in the end , in a faraway future , will surely reveal themselves as motives of an economic type . But what should be emphasized here is that the concept of fatherland , be it upraised on altars or buried in the dust , is not touched in the slightest ; it undergoes no substantial change . IL Tenor is connected to the idea of power . One is afraid of losing power when one is " terrorized " ; one aspires to power when one " terrorizes . " The idea of power , or at least that power which can be obtained by using the weapons of terror , is , in its turn , connected to the idea of time . In fact : a person who gives the impression of knowing how to foresee the movements of values through time will be the one who gets hold of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to guess the exact moment at which a value created by time will be destroyed by time . Obviously , the tenor that approaches the purest state is that which is based on the " tempo " of the calendar ; or , let us say , upon age . To say that such and such a person is backward , obsolete , conservative , traditionalist is always just somebody 's opinion ; but to say that he is old is an affirmation one can not refute . When real age gives the lie to such an affirmation , then one will say that the person 's ideas are " old . " For all these reasons , tenor is a weapon in the hands of people young in age or in ideas ( or of people who define themselves as such ) against the aged and those accused of having " aged " ideas . This terror centers on the duration of biological fact , or , if you prefer , the longevity of sexual force . Sexual prowess is weakened , obviously , in an old man ; one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even if he is young in age , is likewise , though it be in secret , senile . We can thus easily comprehend terror 's efficacy in fields where , to all appearances , the sexual factor should not be at all important . When the terrorist attacks his adversary with the usual accusation of his being " obsolete , " he is saying , in effect , that his adversary is impotent . What can one hold up against the accusation of impotence ? Nothing . The indictment is indisputable because it is not an argument but a statement of fact . At best , the victim of tenor can respond that the one who is really impotent is he , the terrorist . Such a defense does not put an end to the terrorist dynamic . It continues , though by means of an inversion in the positions of the two adversaries . Let us go even further : terror is connected to the idea , also bourgeois , that there is something called history . In history , as is well known , nothing endures or remains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a continuous state of development . Everything is subject to aging , to obsolescence , to de-fashionization . Everything transforms itself from the tragic into the comic , from the real into the unreal , from the true into the false , from the adequate into the inadequate , from the current into the obsolete . It is here , in the realm of historical change , that tenor comes into play as an instrument of power . 38 HARPER 'S MAGAZINE JUNE IV . Classical antiquity does not seem to have been acquainted with terror . Nor was the ancien regime . Terror before the Revolution of ' 89 was real terror , based on the fear of death . Real values did not move ; they were situated outside of time . Consequently , the movements of values in time could not be used to attain and maintain power . The Greek city-states and the ancien regime threatened the life and the liberty of their adversaries , but they were unacquainted with the cut-and-dried guillotine of " history . " Today , only certain curators of the ancient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duration , and must resort to real terror based on the fear of death . But this curatorial mentality is rare , surviving only in the most backward countries of Latin America and Asia . Elsewhere , modem , bourgeois terror has been universally adopted , by Marxists as well as by their adversaries . V. Terrorism in art is called the avant-garde . The avant-garde is terroristic because it believes not in values but in time . The Futurist who decreed that the Mona Lisa was a mere piece of trash was saying something else . And that is : " I do n't know exactly what the Mona Lisa is , I do n't know whether or not yesterday I admired it , I do n't know whether or not today I despise it . I know extremely well , however , what it is I am doing : I am placing the Mona Lisa in time and myself outside of time . That is , I am placing my opinion , which is probably incomplete or , in any case , temporary , into the sphere of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a masterpiece which is by all appearances absolute , inside the sphere of time . By doing this I am transforming the relative ( my opinion ) into the absolute and the absolute ( the Mona Lisa ) into the relative . " VI . The terrorist does not answer his adversary 's arguments with other arguments ; rather , he exiles his adversary to a state of nihilism . Let us look at how he manages to carry out this operation . It is clear that to be in a position to accuse , the terrorist must speak not in his own name but in the name of principles . Just as clearly , these principles have to be accepted by the adversary whom it is necessary to put in a state of nihilism . The whole operation , then , consists in making the adversary , like the dog of the fable , abandon his own principles for the principles of his accuser . How ? In the simplest way possible : by making it understood that principles do not exist , that the discussion will take place on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason . The adversary , confident that he is fighting with equal weapons , accepts . Then and only then does the terrorist reveal the weapon he has kept hidden . So , says the terrorist , there are no such things as principles . If the terrorist 's adversary concedes this point , he proves that he does not have principles of his own . As for the terrorist , he has not abandoned his principles at all ; but his adversary , having been forced to abandon his , has in effect accepted the principles of the terrorist . And what about reason Reason was a trap . His adversary fell into it . VII . Terrorism appeared in the excited atmosphere of the National Convention of Robespierre and the Jacobins , as a weapon of defense for a republic threatened by enemies from without and from within . But it has been employed since then , up to our own day , by different kinds of people and in very different circumstances . What can we infer from this ? That Robespierre , tribune of the bourgeoisie , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the Convention 's struggles but also a method good enough to last forever . This method , the method of terror , has at its roots another invention of the bourgeoisie : the will to power disguised as moralism . Here one understands the workings of terrorism in their essence : the Illustrations by Jean Tuttle will to power is contingent , relative , private ; moralism is its rationalization in the rhetorical costumes of atemporal judgment . VIII . To understand the whole significance of the terroristic method it is necessary to leave the tumults of the Convention and to transport ourselves to those of another fundamental institution of the bourgeoisie : the stock exchange . What takes place at the stock exchange ? There are quotations of values , and these quotations permit stocks to be bought and sold , with a resulting profit on the difference between the price of acquisition and the price of sale . All this would go over as smoothly as oil if something else did not intervene , namely terror . That is , stock manipulation . What is stock manipulation ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) of affecting the quotations of values with illicit and dishonest maneuvers , and in a completely arbitrary manner that does n't correspond to any economic reality . In parliaments there is no terror except in exceptional circumstances ; in the stock market , terror ( that is , stock manipulation ) is almost the norm . It allows not only the depreciation of consistent values ( expressed in , the solidity of companies , factories , land ) but also the rocketing to the stars of those shares and issues that do not have any value whatsoever . All this on the basis of information and rumor and the consequent " states of mind " that determine , according to the circumstances , the upward or downward course desired by the stock manipulator . John Kenneth Galbraith , in his book The Great Crash , mentions the exemplary case of a certain trading house called Goldman , Sachs ( Si . Company , whose shares were sold to the public at 104 at the time of issuance only to descend , during the crisis of 1929 , to one and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one hand , the public had been " terrorized , " in effect intimidated into buying the shares ; on the other hand , the shares themselves had been manipulated in a " terroristic " sense by means of dishonest maneuvers ( Goldman , Sachs bought up its own shares immediately after issuing them , to the end of getting the price quotation to go up again ) . In this example it is clear that stock manipulation , that is , terror in the stock market , articulates itself two times : first through the manipulation of the public , and then through the manipulation of values . But what is stock manipulation if not the very equivalent of the terror that in every field ( from art to politics , from economics to ideology ) , in the very same way , creates fictitious values to the utter detriment of real ones ? At this point it should be noted that terror can not interfere with such things as factories , land , or machinery , for these have no need of terror to prove themselves and therefore do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first historical example of terror again , that of Robespierre , we see that it is not so very different from the stock manipulation that causes certain titles to fall and certain others to rise . At the Convention , heads were falling and rising instead of titles ; that 's the whole difference . What , in any event , was it that compelled Robespierre to come up with his " method " of terrorism , which was then so very new ? Apparently it was patriotic moralism ; in reality it was the will to power , which was then so very new itself , inasmuch as before the revolution one acceded to power only through hereditary privilege . Robespierre 's ambition was therefore disguised as patriotic moralism , an abstraction outside of time and far more radical than virtue , which expresses itself as specific acts in time . Beneath this disguise , he accuses the Girondists , the revolutionary extremists of the day before , of moderation . What does this mean ? That Robespierre " lowers " the value of the Girondists and enables that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to " rise . " But the Girondists , yesterday patriots and today traitors , are they not really-the very same men today as they were yesterday ? Yes , they are , but only outside of the revolutionary time-stream , outside of revolutionary duration . Inside the revolutionary time-stream , in which Robespierre has inserted them with arbitrary violence ( placing himself at the 42 HARPER 'S MAGAZINE/JUNE same time outside of this time-stream , in a zone that is absolute ) , the Girondists ' revolutionary extremism has become traitorous moderation . What is the reality of this transaction ? It is a reality similar to that of the stock market , in which the stock manipulator is the cause of certain stocks ( the Girondists ) being disposed of and certain others ( the Jacobins ) being purchased , without the inherent quality of these stocks undergoing any actual change . All this thanks to terroristic intimidation , based , at the stock exchange , on the financial time-stream , and , at the Convention , on the political time-stream . IX . Terrorism takes on different names @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself ; but it is always the exalter of fictitious values and the disparager of real values , and its purpose is always the enhancement of power . It is called snobbery , political tactic , artistic avant-garde , playing the stock market , society gossip ; but it always acts as the slave of time in order to strike a blow against value . By pitting time against value , terror reveals the absolute emptiness upon which the edifice of bourgeois society rests , to say nothing of those who combat that society with the bourgeois weapon of terror . X. The terrorist is often a dirty rat who pretends to be a dirty rat . But he can also be an authentic artist or an honest politician who makes use of terrorism in order to defend himself from terrorism . XI . Terror reduces everything to time , and then reduces time to the fleeting moment . Hence the recourse to the " realism " of the little detail for the purpose of intimidation . Dostoyevsky gives us an example of this " realism " in The Possessed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terrorist mentality . Here are the conspirators , gathered in the house of one of their own to discuss revolutionary theory . Verkhovensky , who has been stretched out in a slothful and contemptuous posture during the whole debate , suddenly asks for a deck of cards , as if to say that it would be better to play cards than to listen to such foolishness . Then : Elle turned towards the mistress of the house : " Irina Prokhorovna , do n't you have a pair of scissors someplace ' " Why do you want a pair of scissors ? " she asked . " I forgot to cut my nails , and I 've been meaning to do it now for three days , " he answered , observing peaceably his long and unclean fingernails . Irina Prokhorovna 's face turned red ; but it seemed that Madame Virginskaya was amused by something . " It seems to me I just saw them a little while ago , here , by the window . " She got up and went to look for the scissors and immediately brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look at her , he took the scissors and began to put them to use . Irina Prokhorovna understood that it was one way of doing something " realistic " and she was ashamed of her own susceptibility . In every authentic investigation of the truth , terror flattens the climax of the drama with the anticlimax of a sarcastic and apparently demystifying , and because of this intimidating , " realism . " Terroristic realism , in short , sets its sights on the paralysis of reason and therefore on the abolition of dialectical discourse . The terroristic method in art and in politics can be applied in any circumstances and in favor of any product or value . In politics , for example , it is adopted by the left as well as by the right . It is true that the terror of Robespierre was born as extremism of the left . But the technique of terror that consists in demonstrating that one 's adversaries are " obsolete , " that is , superseded in the time-stream , was applied with much success by Fascism and Nazism in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as is well known , in convincing enormous masses that socialism was " old , " that Marxism was " obsolete . " More recently , neocapitalism has made the same demonstration about the evil doings of Stalinism . XII . The masses are never terroristic , inasmuch as they do not believe in time but rather in values . The bourgeoisie , which believes in time and not in values , has almost always been terroristic . Some will object at this point that terrorism is at the very heart of revolutions , and so how can it be said that the people are not terroristic ? But it would be easy to demonstrate that the only class that is truly revolutionary is the bourgeoisie , for the reason that it believes in movements of values through time . The people are not revolutionary ; they are the eternal substance of revolution . XIII . The artistic and cultural avant-garde is often terroristic ; but artists and men of culture , taken one by one , individually , even if they be new men and revolutionary , are very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be made by groups ; an individual can not create terrorism by himself The reason that avant-garde groups are terroristic and that isolated individuals of the avant-garde are not has to do with the ability of a group to create , by means of the multiplicity of its interventions and operations , a market of values and then to gamble on their rise and fall . Obviously this can not be done by one individual alone , even should he desire it and propose it as his purpose . XIV . The artistic avant-garde can not not be terroristic , because it deals with fashions so obviously subject to time . By that I mean artistic trends . The critical debate , the respectful appraisal , the strenuous analysis are of no purpose to the avant-garde , because it is impatient for certain styles to crumble away and certain others to be established in their place . The movements of enduring values through time ( precisely because it is a question of art , of something that ? is by its nature outside of time ) are extremely slow , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absurdity ( in Europe , during the first postwar era , almost every day one was a witness to the birth of new ' ' movements " and new " currents " ) has always brought about the end of the avant-garde . In this way the terroristic and bourgeois idea of time as a creator of value comes to be identified with the idea of modernity . Time , in fact , renders certain values anachronistic , nonexistent ( that is , " historical " ) , and certain others existent . But the accusation of anachronism , so frequent in the polemics of the avant-garde , brings us back to the concept of value as expedient selection . That is , to youth and old age as synonyms of value and non-value . Thus , once again , the tempo of terror reveals itself as biological duration . XV . Today , the artistic avant-gardes , in all countries , feel instinctively that the terrain of art no longer consents to terroristic operations , and so , in search of familiar ground , they line up alongside political movements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the passage from art to politics is not easy . Art can not politicize itself without committing suicide : in politics , terrorism is always anti-cultural . Since artistic terror no longer terrorizes the bourgeoisie but rather stimulates it , like a new pimento or a new sauce , it is necessary that art search out other terroristic possibilities . A terrorist is born out of ancestral alienation , out of secular devitalization , out of creative impotence , out of lack of imagination , out of biological deficiency . And we have seen many artists pass without concern from artistic terror to political terror . This is what Che Guevara rightly called the suicide of the intellectuals as a class .
