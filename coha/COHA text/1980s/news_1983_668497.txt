For the first time since President Franklin D. Roosevelt defeated Thomas E. Dewey to win a fourth term in 1944 , Bostonians will find a Roosevelt on their ballots this year . There ' s also a Dewey on the state ' s political scene but any possible Roosevelt-Dewey matchup is a long way in the future . Mark Roosevelt , 27 , great-grandson of President Theodore Roosevelt and son of Kermit Roosevelt , best known for his CIA role in returning the fallen shah of Iran to his throne in 1951 , is running for Boston City Council . It ' s his first run for public office . Although the City Council race formally is nonpartisan , Roosevelt has spurned the Republican tradition of his side of the family and is a Democrat . On the Republican side , meanwhile , there ' s Tom Dewey , 23 , a political beginner who claims his namesake as a distant uncle . " I ' m from the same strain , " he said . Dewey , a 1981 graduate of Gordon College , Wenham , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Republican State Committee . Dewey sees himself eventually seeking political office in Massachusetts . Is there a prospect of a Dewey-Roosevelt matchup someday ? " It ' s something that ' s possible , " said Dewey , who is from Syracuse , N.Y . " I think eventually I ' ll run for office in Massachusetts . " The namesakes never have met . Roosevelt said in an interview his family name hasn ' t helped his race against three other candidates for council from the city ' s new 8th District , which cuts through Boston from wealthy , silk-stocking Beacon Hill to blue- collar Mission Hill and includes the trendy Back Bay . " Name recognition is much less a factor than you would have thought , " he said . " Occasionally , someone asks if I ' m related to somebody . But this is a very local race . People are interested in meeting the person who is going to represent them . " I think that coming from a family that has a political tradition has influenced me to one degree or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ m capable of figuring out how it has influenced me . " The name hasn ' t helped particularly in raising money although Roosevelt said he already has raised about $30,000 of the $40,000 he thinks he needs to be one of two to survive a Sept. 27 runoff for the November general election . The election is the first in which councilors will be elected from districts . Previously , councilors were elected at-large . ( Roosevelt ' s opponents for the $32,500 council post are : Eugenie Beal , former director of the city ' s enviroment department ; Dennis Quilty , a former assistant district attorney and David Scondras , a tenant activitist who is the only self-avowed gay candidate for office in Boston this year . ) Dewey ' s name has been important to his young political career . " It ' s influenced me a lot , " he said in an interview . " It ' s followed me forever and given me a natural interest in politics . Are you related ? ' The question always comes up . " Both young politicians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ January after a stint with the Republican Study Committee . Roosevelt , a Washington native , worked for the domestic policy staff of the Carter White House before entering Harvard Law School in 1980 . He was graduated last May .
