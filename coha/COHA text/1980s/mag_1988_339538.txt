Talk about rip-offs . Even the most hardened residents of Detroit 's crime- ridden East Side have been stunned by the latest target of some enterprising robbers : aluminum siding . The off-the-wall trend began last year , when siding suddenly began disappearing from abandoned houses around the neighborhood . More recently , aluminum rustlers , emboldened by the local cops ' relaxed attitude toward the thefts , have taken to prying off the siding from the garages of occupied homes . Even lawn chairs are no longer safe . <P> And what are the thieves doing with their booty ? Taking advantage of a recent boom in recycling , which generates an estimated $700 million a year , by selling it to scrap dealers who lately have raised their prices . Last year in Detroit , the price of aluminum leaped from 20 cents to 45 cents per lb . " When they go to the scrapyard , " fumes Detroit community activist Pat Bosch , " no questions are asked . " For law-abiding citizens already beleaguered by drug- trafficking , arson and the indifference of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " They 're devastating the city , " complains Sophie Sroczynski , who had siding torn from her garage : " It 's almost unbearable . "
