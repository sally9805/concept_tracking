The Consumer Price Index , the most widely watched measure of inflation , was getting out of whack with today 's American life-style . Last adjusted in 1978 , the Labor Department 's so-called market basket of goods and services was too heavily weighted with such items as hard liquor , red meat and tobacco , all of which the typical American now consumes less of than a decade ago . So last week when the Government released its January CPI figure , the number reflected a reapportioned mix of goods and services to measure more accurately inflation for the typical consumer . <P> The new mix puts more emphasis on poultry and less importance on red meat , sugar and fatty foods . Auto repairs are diminished too , partly because vehicles tend to last longer . But spending on entertainment , notably cable television and restaurant meals , has risen . Health care is getting less emphasis than a decade ago , which is not to say prices have fallen but only that more costs are covered by insurance . <P> The total bill for updating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ households in 1982-84 , was $45 million . But that amount is small compared with how much the Government might save from a more precise CPI . Reason : the index serves as the basis for adjustments in payments to tens of millions of Social Security recipients and other federal beneficiaries .
