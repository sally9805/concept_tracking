It seems from Anselm Kiefer 's retrospective , which has just opened at the Art Institute of Chicago , that at 42 this German artist is the best painter of his generation on either side of the Atlantic . Given most of the talent we have , this may not sound like much of a compliment . Certainly Kiefer 's limitations are inescapable : his drawing lacks fluency and clarity and his color is monotonous , though the former seems to reinforce the grinding earnestness of his style and the latter contributes to its lugubrious intensity . What counts , is that he is one of the few visual artists in the past decade to have shown an unmistakable greatness of vision . <P> His ambitions for painting range across myth and history , they cover an immense terrain of cultural reference and pictorial techniques , and on the whole they do it without the megalomaniac narcissism that fatally trivializes the work of other artists to whom Kiefer is sometimes compared  --  Julian Schnabel , for instance . Kiefer bears , in full measure , the tragic sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our fin de siecle has insulated itself , and his stature can only grow with time . Which is not to say , of course , that all his work is of equal value . <P> The Chicago show was organized by the late A. James Speyer ( from 1961 to 1986 the Art Institute 's curator of 20th century painting ) and Mark Rosenthal of the Philadelphia Museum , who wrote its catalog . It will travel through 1988 to Philadelphia , Los Angeles and New York City . An hour at it can be a fairly exhausting experience , like a slog toward a receding horizon across the plowed clay fields that are Kiefer 's favorite landscape . His canvases are huge in size and engulfing in scale ; he is , one notes , one of the few artists around who really do understand the scale of images and do not paint big just to look important . <P> A list of his materials , apart from paint , would include paper , staples , canvas , rough foil formed by throwing a bucket of molten lead on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gold leaf , copper wire , woodcuts and lumps of busted ceramic . It is highly unlikely that more than a few will survive for 50 or even 25 years . Kiefer carries a disregard for the permanence of his materials to such an extreme that the lead will not stay in place and the straw on some canvases is already rotting , though this does not seem to discourage collectors . <P> The subjects of his art include Egyptian legends , alchemy , the Cabala , the Holocaust , the story of Exodus , Napoleon 's occupation of Germany , Albert Speer 's architecture , the mythic roots and Nazi uses of German romantic imagery  --  dark woods , lonely travelers , ecstatic moral conversions in the face of nature  --  and much more besides . Among Kiefer 's spiritual heroes are Richard Wagner , Frederick II , Joseph Beuys , Painters Arnold Bocklin and Caspar David Friedrich and Novelist Robert Musil . Kiefer is not an artist of ordinary ambitions . But his ambitions are not bound up in the cult of celebrity that has riddled the art world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ virtually no photographs and spends most of his time behind the locked gates of his studio in the unremarkable German town of Buchen . " Live like a bourgeois , think like a god "  --  if any painter has taken Gustave Flaubert 's famous injunction to heart , it is Kiefer.
