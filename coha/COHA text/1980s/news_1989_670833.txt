" The fact that the problem is this big is no reason for not attacking it , " Mr. Dinkins said. // Mayor Edward I. Koch , on the other hand , defended New York City ' s efforts and warned of the dangers of losing control of spending and raising unreasonable expectations that the city could solve the problems of poverty. // " We ' re not being asked to do too much , " Mr. Koch said . " But the expectations of the results are too high . The city government can not take the role of decent mothers and fathers responsible for raising their children in a decent way. " // The differences on family and education issues between the candidates in the Democratic and Republican primaries emerged in separate interviews earlier this month. // The candidates discussed the problems that children face in school and at home . Their answers ranged from increasing spending for social workers to removing children from homes where parents use drugs to giving the mayor more control of the Board of Education to reducing the number of students @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Richard Ravitch , the former chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority , both said family issues would have a high priority in their administrations , but as Mr. Goldin put it , " There was a realistic budgetary limit on what this city can do. " // Mr. Goldin and Mr. Ravitch , both Democrats , were the only candidates who called for a separate child welfare agency as a way to give more attention to children ' s issues . But while Mr. Ravitch wanted major changes in the structure of the Board of Education to give him more control , Mr. Goldin said he would " achieve massive reforms in public education " by using the mayor ' s power over the budget to force change. // Rudolph W. Giuliani , a former United States Attorney in Manhattan and a Republican mayoral candidate , said the mayor should control the Board of Education , but he seemed unfamiliar with some issues involving welfare and children - for example , he called for the Federal Government to raise welfare benefit levels , although benefit levels are set by the State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Austria and the other Republican mayoral candidate , called for reducing the city bureaucracy but at the same time said he supported expanding city spending to help keep families together . He said that the school bureaucracy was " not working " and that he was still studying ways to make it better. // Of the six candidates for mayor , Mr. Dinkins was the only one to support an increase in the welfare benefits paid to poor New Yorkers - even if it cost city taxpayers more than $200 million a year , as city budget officials have estimated. // The average welfare grant is now about 15 percent below the Federal poverty level , city officials said . Mr. Dinkins said he would support raising it to the Federal poverty level. // Mr. Koch , who has been at odds with the State Legislature for years over welfare spending , said he would oppose any increase in the rate unless the state picked up the entire cost . Other candidates did not commit the city to finding funds for an increase. // For example , Mr. Lauder , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " It has to be enough that they can survive , be able to live and become part of New York City , and I ' d have to look very carefully into the number and see what exactly that number is. " // Mr. Dinkins said that while he preferred to " get the money from someplace else " he would still support a city-financed increase . He said his rationale was that the increase in the welfare grant would save money by reducing " a greater cost " - the cost of housing homeless families evicted because they could not pay their rent. // State officials say the custody of children of drug-abusing parents is becoming increasingly important as the city comes to grips with the spread of crack . William J. Grinker , the city ' s Human Resources Administrator , said that under current city policy babies born with signs of drug addiction are not released to their mothers until city workers " assure that that mother is in treatment. " // Asked about parents on drugs , only Mr. Koch said children should be automatically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she could prove she was capable of caring from them. // " Our general premise should be , yes , but it should be subject to refutation , " Mr. Koch said . " If the professional said , ' She is on drugs , but she ' s a hell of a good mother , ' I am not for taking the kid away. " // Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Ravitch said that every case should be judged individually . Mr. Goldin said it would " inhibit mothers from coming forward and seeking help . " Mr. Lauder said he would prefer to provide families with social workers to help them. // Mr. Dinkins said " One would have to examine the facts , " with the decision possibly depending on the degree of addiction . " As you know , we have addicts , including physicians , who go to work every day , operate on patients , perform and function , " he said . " We may not even know until they misbehave , unfortunately . " <> <> Matter of Cost Effectiveness // All candidates supported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like tutoring , day care and home care - to help keep families together , but Mr. Koch and Mr. Dinkins presented plans with significant differences. // Mr. Dinkins says such services would be cost effective because they would reduce the long-term need for such services . He cited , for example , $175 , 000 he put in the budget - matched by $175 , 000 in state money - under a program intended to provide services to a small number of families who seek help but where the children are not in imminent danger of being placed in foster care . <> <> ' Try to Keep the Kid ' // " Not only is money so expended cost effective , but it produces more revenue , " he said . " I am interested in before the stuff hits the fan , when you can save the family. " // Mr. Koch said he , too , supported preventive services " to try to keep the kid in the house and then provide services to keep the family intact , " and in fact , the city was already spending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said the city provided $100 million in such services to 30 , 000 families last year . Those services are mandated under state law , he said , and half of them were provided through private social-service agencies that help families seeking help. // But unlike the program that Mr. Dinkins cited , the city , under a different provision of state law , receives $3 for every $1 it spends , he said. // City officials have been reluctant to expand those services to more families out of a fear that tens of thousands of people who are functioning well would seek help and raise costs . Mr. Dinkins assailed this attitude. // " This is not a circumstance wherein you hang out a sign and say anybody who feels a little bit troubled come on in and get some money , " Mr. Dinkins said . " It doesn ' t work that way. // While Mr. Ravitch and Mr. Giuliani want to give the mayor control of the Board of Education , Mr. Koch , who has made several unsuccessful attempts in Albany to gain control of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said , he has been able to help improve the school system - for example reducing class size , increasing teachers ' salaries , reducing the dropout rate - by working within the existing structure. // " I have had some major changes , " Mr. Koch said . He said his mission in the next four years would be " to connect the kid with skills that will allow that child to get a job. " // Mr. Giuliani said he wanted to give parents more of a say in how schools are run . But rather than offering a blueprint to improve the schools he suggested that teachers and administrators already had the answers . He said people on the staffs of " high schools that are working well in disadvantaged areas " help show staff members at other schools " the principles that are working well. " // Mr. Ravitch supported making local school boards appointed rather than elected and granting administrators and teachers more authority to make decisions and run the schools as they see fit. // " Teachers will take much more responsibility for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and say in the classroom , " he said. // Mr. Goldin said he would develop an agenda of " realizable , achievable goals " like dropout prevention programs in elementary schools , new programs to get parents more involved in their children ' s public schools and a sharp reduction in the central board ' s staff . <> <> Seeking More Aid // Mr. Dinkins said aside from some technical changes in the way community school board votes are counted he would leave the central Board of Education intact . " I ' ve offered some specific plans on education , " he said . " I want smaller class sizes , smaller schools , that is smaller school buildings. " // Mr. Dinkins said he would press the Legislature to allocate a greater share of education aid to New York City , which has 37 percent of the state ' s students but receives only 33 percent of state aid. // The city has won only modest improvements in the education aid formula in recent years despite pressure from Gov . Mario M. Cuomo and Mr. Koch . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produce results. // " You must say : ' Come , let us reason together . Let me show you why it ' s in your interests , ' " he said. // Asked about the importance of race in selecting a new chancellor for a school system that is 80 percent minority , only Mr. Koch and Mr. Dinkins said it should be considered but only if the candidates are otherwise roughly equivalent. // " I know qualified blacks who have said they wouldn ' t take a job that ' s designated as a black job because it is insulting to them , " Mr. Ravitch said . " They don ' t want to be picked on the basis of their color , their skin , they want to be picked on the basis that they ' re most qualified .
