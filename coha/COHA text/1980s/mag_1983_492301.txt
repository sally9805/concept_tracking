JOE PATERNO : THE LION IN AUTUMN oe Paterno , coach of Penn State 's Nittany Lions , tells his players to eat , drink and be merry tomorrow  --  for today , on the practice field , they surely must die . Using tactics that would have made him a success in any field , the 56-year-old goads , drives and pushes his gridiron stars until they either share his love of perfection or quit . As a result , after 33 years with the Lions  --  the last 18 as head coach  --  Paterno has become the unofficial patriarch of college football . Paterno 's cumulative record is the envy of his peers : 161 victories against only 34 defeats and one tie . His winning percentage of 82.4 is tops among college football coaches with at least a decade 's experience . And last January , Paterno 's hungry Lions achieved the ultimate goal in college football  --  earning the nation 's No. 1 ranking in the polls after edging the Bulldogs of Georgia 27-23 in the Sugar Bowl . But more important to Paterno @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ classroom as well . Quarterback Todd Blackledge , for example , who recently inked a $1.5 million contract with the Kansas City Chiefs of the National Football League , finished his college career with a 3.8 average ( out of 4.0 ) and Phi Beta Kappa status . In an era when athletic muscle far outweighs gray matter , even at the most prestigious universities , Paterno staunchly advocates the **25;4487;TOOLONG philosophy of Greek times . More than 90 percent of his athletes eventually graduate  --  undoubtedly another record if other coaches were n't too embarrassed to releasetheir graduation figures . " Eve never wanted to be just a football coach , " says Paterno . " I 've always enjoyed the academic environment : I 've tried to stay involved with the faculty . I think it 's important that the faculty understand that , though football certainly has a place in the university , it is not the kind of thing where the tail is wagging the dog . " Paterno makes himself available to his peers at Penn State . He attends faculty meetings , lectures and cultural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where he quarterbacked two winning seasons ( 7-2 in ' 48 and 8-1 in ' 49 ) , Paterno won the support of faculty members everywhere when he backed a recent National Collegiate Athletic Association decision mandating stringent national rules for athletic eligibility . By the autumn of 1986 , all freshman athletes will have passed a high-school core curriculum that includes English , math , social science and physical science , along with 700 SAT or 15 ACT composite scores . The rule is certain to aid Paterno-coached teams , which have complied with tough standards all along , something the Nittany Lions like to refer to as " the Penn State way . " In fact , Paterno would prefer talking about student accomplishments off the field . He gives the impression that it would thrill him more to produce a Nobel Prize achiever than a Heilman Trophy winner from his Penn State offensive backfield. " 1 had a great kid by the name of Bruce Bannon who was an All-American defensive end here back in ' 72 , " says Paterno . " He was a geologist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to do this research to get a project together  --  a drawing of the strata of the earth . Afterwards , he gave me his research work ; he had framed it for me . Students are here to get an education . You ca n't talk about priorities and then say , ' Hey ! You ca n't do that project because you have to come to spring practice . ' " Paterno himself has collected numerous academic honors , among them an honorary doctor of laws degree from Brown University and an honorary doctor of humane letters from Gettysburg College . An educated man who , late at night , is as likely to be found reading Greek and Roman historians as he is his own playbook , Paterno comes by his love for education honestly . " My father 's people are very educated people , " stresses the coach , admonishing those writers who have equated his Brooklyn origins with the stereotyped streetwise Flatbusher of movie lore . " One aunt was the head of a Romance language department ; another aunt was an artist . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uncle was a sportswriter for the old Brooklyn Eagle . My dad became a lawyer when I was 12 years old . He went to night school , finishing high school , college and law school at night . He was in his early 40s when he passed the bar . " Interviewed after practice , Pater-no , wearing his preferred dress , a conservative business suit , is easygoing and charming . His conversation is splashed with humorous asides and self-depreciating jokes . He delights in making small talk about his wife Susan and his five children , ages 5 to 20 , although he generally tries to keep his private life from becoming too public . He is accessible to a fault ; his home phone and address , for example , are published in the directory . However , Paterno 's close friends and even his assistant coaches will tell you that they do n't know any more about the man after 20 years than they learned their first few days with him  --  although they do know more about his outlook . " Joe is a people-oriented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 33-year-old public-relations director . " He looks for solutions that involve people , not a solution that involves technology or money . He deals in trust , compassion and understanding . " By the same token , Paterno is a man who can be easy to doublecross  --  once . " Cheat me once and it 's shame upon you ; cheat me twice and it 's shame upon me " is a favorite motto of his . At the present time , for example , Paterno is waging a quiet war with the pros , angered by the way some teams have regarded American universities as little more than breeding farms for talent . " We 've got a running battle trying to get the pros not to overwork senior players before graduation , " says Paterno , the coach who once spurned a $1.3 million offer from the New England Patriots . " Last year I had three kids that did n't graduate with their class , and they were all outstanding high-school students . There was no reason for them not to graduate , except that they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It really upsets me . " Paterno also grinds his ax against the fraternity of sportswriters " that dwell on the negative side " of competition . " Chief Justice Warren said one time he used to like to read the sports pages first , because it was positive news about people doing things , " says Paterno , confiding that he rarely reads the sports pages unless he is looking for something specific that day . " I do n't want to read about salary disputes , labor lawyers and those kinds of problems , " he stresses . " I do n't want to read where some kid is saying , ' Play me or trade me ! ' or ' Coach is n't treating me right . ' " What the coach does want to read are descriptions about great plays in great games  --  the raison d'etre for sports pages to exist in the first place , and the reason fans supposedly attend games , for that matter . " I want to read that so-and-so had a homer with two on in the last of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says Paterno . The negative comments he reads about himself in the paper come from athletes who either object to his drill-sergeant attitude at practices or who have been unable to crack the talent-rich Penn State first team . In particular , Paterno came under fire in 1979 , when his players were involved in scandals that would shock even a coach whose standards were below those set by someone famed for integrity and honorable conduct . Penn State lost All-America safety Pete Harris ( brother of the NFL Pittsburgh Steelers ' Franco Harris , a ' 72 Penn State graduate ) and two other starters because of academic ineligibility. along with three additional players arrested on charges ranging from drunken driving to first-degree burglary . In short , despite limping out of the Liberty Bowl with a 9-6squeaker over Tulane , the season proved a major embarrassment for Paterno . Characteristically , however , he accepts full blame for the lost season . " The ' 79 season was a depressing one and probably my fault , because I spent a lot of time away lecturing since I did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I got careless . At that time I debated whether I ought to get out of coaching , not because 1 felt burnt out physically , mentally or emotionally , but because I thought I was getting too old or should be getting into something else . " As a result of that season , Pater-no cut down slightly on the grueling practices he formerly conducted , limiting the time spent later in the season , in particular . He also eased up on the demands he was making on his coaches , men such as Bob Phillips , the quarterback coach , who has been with Paterno for 18 years . Instead he began concentrating on getting " quality work " out of his staff , dismissing them for the day when they began to tire and assembling again the next day . " We 'd be sitting around in a staff meeting at one or two o'clock in the morning with everybody just looking at each other , " he laughs . " We could never come up with a good idea at that stage . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game time , as well . Until the 1982 season the coach relied heavily on the " grunt ' n grind " brand of football , steam-rolling into the end zone with one running play after another , eschewing the pass even in passing situations . Such inflexibility supposedly hurt him in 1978 : A 12-0 Penn State team was defeated in the Orange Bowl by Alabama when consecutive Lions ' drives were halted at the one-yard line , following unsuccessful plunges into the Alabama line . Paterno rebutted the criticism , but he did admit the second-guessers made him doubt himself . Last year , however , Paterno gave Todd Blackledge , perhaps the most talented quarterback ever to play for the Lions , carte blanche to throw the ball . The 6 ' 3 " , 225-pound quarterback responded by throwing for continued on page 98 i'onnegut continued from page 88 " With my father ? " said Karl incredulously . " With yours  --  with yours . It 's him I 'm supposed to get to love me , He 's supposed to be eating out his heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea . " He waved his arms wildly . " The station wagon , the duets , the guns that never miss , the son that works on hand signals  --  that 's all for your father to want . " Franklin was amazed . " Karl , " he said , " that 's all in your head . You are what your own father would rather have than half of Waggoner Pump or anything ! " " I used to think so , " said Karl . " The plate and cube you made , Karl , " said Franklin , " you gave them to my father , but they were really a present for yours . And what perfect presents from a son to a father ! I never gave my father anything like that  --  anything I 'd put my heart and soul into . I could n't ! " Karl reddened and turned his back again . " I did n't make ' em , " he said . He shivered . " I tried . How I tried ! " " I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ern ! " said Karl bitterly . " And I found out it did n't make any difference to him who made ' em , just as long as your father thought I 'd made ' em . " Franklin gave a sad , low whistle . " When my old man did that , " said Karl , " he rubbed my nose in what the big thing was to him . " He wiped his nose on his jacket sleeve . " But , Karl --  " said Franklin . Karl rolled his eyes . " Oh , hell , " he said tiredly , " I do n't blame him . Sorry I said anything . I 'm O.K. ? I 'm O.K. I 'll live . " He flicked the tinfoil target with a finger tip . " I 'm gon na miss , and the hell with ' em . " Nothing more was said . The two trudged back to their fathers . It seemed to Franklin that they were leaving behind all they 'd said , that the rising wind was whirling their dark thoughts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firing line , Franklin was thinking only of whisky , steak and a red-hot stove . When he and Karl fired at the tinfoil , Franklin ticked a corner . Karl hit it in the middle . Rudy tapped his temple ; then saluted Karl with a crooked finger . Karl returned the salute . After supper , Rudy and Karl played duets for flute and clarinet . They played without music , intricately and beautifully . Franklin and Merle could only keep time with their fingers , hoping , wistfully , that their fingers on the tabletop sounded like drums . Franklin glanced at his father . When their eyes met , they decided instantly that their drumming was n't helping the music at all . Their drumming stopped . It was a surprisingly affectionate moment . With the moment to think about , to puzzle him pleasantly , Franklin found that the music was n't speaking anymore of just Rudy and Karl . It was speaking of all fathers and sons . It was saying hauntingly what they had all been saying haltingly , what they had all been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes with cruelty and sometimes with love  --  that fathers and sons were one . It was saying , too , that a time for parting in spirit was near  --  no matter how close anyone held anyone else , and no matter what anyone else tried to do . A Joe Paterno continued from page 63 2,218 yards , 22 touchdowns and a No. 1 national ranking . This year , with junior quarterback Doug Strang at the helm , Paterno is expected to revert to his ground game until the Linwood , New Jersey , youngster picks up additional experience . Blackledge , incidentally , is effusive in his praise for Paterno . He says his Penn State experience is standing him in good stead as he battles for a Kansas City starting berth . " I learned discipline from Paterno , " says Blackledge , a born-again Christian . " You learn to adjust to him and his style and to do things his way , or you have a miserable time . He 's a very upright , moral person , and he did a good job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ registered Republican , can be anything but conservative in his demands for better regulation of college football by its watchdog organization , the NCAA . Three times Paterno and the Lions have been frustrated in their bid for a No. 1 ranking ( 1968 , 1969 and 1973 ) , despite their having undefeated seasons each time . Pater-no has long criticized the way coaches in the UPI poll and sportswriters in the AP poll pick the top team . He prefers some sort of elimination match to decide the outcome . This year , Paterno 's pet peeve is against the universities that accept athletes who can barely read or write as long as they can perform on the gridiron . " There 's a whole bunch of people out there taking the marginal students and forcing the other schools , in order to be competitive , to take them , " Paterno charges . " We 've got to get the 60 or 80 schools willing to do things the way they ought to be done , giving these other people five or six years to clean up their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , fine  --  we wo n't play them ! " By coincidence , or perhaps not , continued on following page Paterno says he wants to remain in the game five or six more years . A man who always needs new worlds to conquer , Paterno appears to be ready to take on a much bigger job  --  putting the big-business world of college football into its proper role . The job , of course , is too big for any one man  --  and that 's just the challenge Joe Paterno relishes.
