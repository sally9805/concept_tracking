The tiny ( average height 5 ft . ) Bushmen of the Kalahari Desert are the oldest human inhabitants of southern Africa and one of the oldest distinct races of mankind . They speak a unique and difficult language , which one anthropologist describes as " an array of weird phonemes-clickings , croakings and raspings . " They believe God hurled to earth a piece of turf that broke into pieces ; the pieces became nations and the particles of dust their own minute , wandering tribe . Today only a few of the 55,000 remaining Bushmen still pursue their ancient way of life as nomadic hunters , tracking game across the Kalahari 's parched wilderness . Most have settled into villages and camps on the edge of the desert . Now a number have traded in their bows and poisoned arrows for the R4 rifles of the South African army . <P> Some 850 Bushmen are organized into a separate battalion of the South West Africa Territory Force headquartered at Omega , a base camp in Namibia 's northeastern Caprivi Strip . Assigned on a rotating basis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have distinguished themselves in combat . Five have been killed ; one was posthumously awarded the Honoris Crux , one of the highest military decorations . Their tracking skills have introduced a new element to the counterinsurgency tactics . " They have fantastic eyesight , " says a South African lieutenant , " and they can navigate in the bush without a compass or map . " The Bushmen , in fact , were given their name , " Bosman , " by 17th century Dutch settlers because of their ability to use the brushy landscape for their own protection . In admiration of the skills the Bushman has acquired from millenniums of hunting game , one lieutenant observes , " For the Bushman , tracking is a science . He can track and backtrack , use false tracks-all the dirty tricks . " <P> There are only a few distractions that can divert the Bushmen from a guerrilla 's trail . An entire unit will come to a halt to collect and devour the honey from a wild-bee comb in a tree , for instance . And the presence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on inexplicable and uncontrollable fits of derisive laughter from the Bushmen . Otherwise , they have won the respect of their South African officers . " They 've taught me what survival means , " says one . " For all their small stature , they can put some of our big stocky guys to shame . " Says another : " I 've been on patrols with those guys . With the Bushmen along , our chances of dying are very slight . They have incredible tenacity , patience and endurance . They 've taught me to respect another race . "
