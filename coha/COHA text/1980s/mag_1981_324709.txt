College lovers , it seems , beat each other up quite often <P> When Sociologist James Makepeace , 35 , surveyed undergraduates at Bemidji State University in Minnesota during the spring of 1979 , he came on a finding that surprised him : one of every five students reported being punched , slapped or shoved by their dates or lovers . Says Makepeace , an expert on premarital family violence : " It used to be said that a marriage license was a hitting license , but now we 've discovered that on college campuses there 's an awful lot of hitting without the license .

A few even spoke of threats with guns and knives . The case of Valerie , 20 , and Steve , 23 , two students at a large Western university , is in some ways typical . The couple had only been dating for three months when Steve slapped Valerie because he thought she was flirting with another man . Like most campus couples who later come to blows , they moved in together .

He sometimes hurled Valerie to the floor , dragging her around by her hair , and , she says , " literally beat the hell out of my face . " Several black eyes later , Valerie walked out . <P> In their fear and confusion , few college women-and even fewer men-are willing to admit having been the victims of violence . As one woman student at Arizona State said of her regularly bruised and beaten but steadfastly silent girlfriends : " Before they 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bones . "
