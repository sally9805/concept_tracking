Traditionally , investigative reporters have relied on shoe leather and patience to ferret out the proverbial smoking gun . However , in the computer age , newsmen are enlisting the machine with dramatic results : <P> In Providence , the Journal-Bulletin used an IBM 4381 to analyze 30,000 low- interest mortgages issued by the Rhode Island Housing and Mortgage Finance Corp . By matching mortgage issue dates with the bond issue that financed them , the machine helped expose a " secret fund " that apparently was used to give out RIHMFC loans to politically connected people like the daughter of former Governor J. Joseph Garrahy ( who has since returned the loan ) . Following the revelations in the Journal-Bulletin , the Fleet National Bank and 24 individuals were indicted . <P> At the Milwaukee Journal , Reporter Nina Bernstein heard that undefended indigents were being jailed for months because they could not pay $100-to-$300 fines for offenses like jaywalking . She went after the story , helped by clerks who fed records of 899 inmates through a computer . Says Bernstein : " I interviewed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were stunned . " The courts freed hundreds of inmates , threw out 20,000 orders for jail commitment and told the county to provide attorneys for poor defendants . The computer 's statistics , says Bernstein , " made our case airtight . " She adds that without the machine , her work would have required up to a year of research rather than the six weeks it took . <P> In 1985 Reporter Richard Mauer of the Anchorage Daily News joined with Computer Wizard and Free-Lance Reporter Larry Makinson to trace campaign contributions given to local officials . They uncovered a nest of questionable schemes , including one to funnel 20 seemingly independent $1,000 contributions to a single state senator in one day . " Without the computer , " says Makinson , " this information would have remained buried like a treasure chest at the bottom of the sea . " <P> This week Bernstein and the Milwaukee Journal as well as Makinson and Mauer of the Anchorage Daily News are being recognized for their high-tech digging ! with awards from an association called Investigative Reporters &; Editors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Journalism . Says I.R.E . Executive Director Steve Weinberg : " The computer is revolutionizing investigative reporting . There 's just no way you could do some of those calculations by hand .
