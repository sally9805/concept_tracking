But in the United States , the amount of money raised from the sale of stock , the fuel for corporate expansion , has been shrinking from a peak three years ago . In the first eight months of this year , Japanese corporations raised more than $110 billion , compared with $20 billion by American companies , by far the largest gap ever between the countries , according to figures from the Tokyo Stock Exchange and the Securities Data Company in New York . <> <> A Profound Message // The boom in raising capital in Japan carries a profound message for competition between American and Japanese banks and corporations : Japanese companies are finding it easier to raise relatively cheap capital to modernize , increase productivity and expand . That could benefit them as they prepare for increasingly tough competition in the global marketplace. // " The really awesome thing is what this will mean in three or four years , when the Japanese begin to realize the benefits of their investments and their productivity shoots up , " said Eric Rasmussen , an economist at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ companies prefer selling stock to borrowing , because they do not have to repay the money , as they do with a loan . Of course , stock prices and interest rates can be volatile , which sometimes makes it more advantageous for companies to borrow funds . But because equity capital is permanent , managers can generally plan for the long term in a more stable environment . <> <> The Rewards of Patience // Much depends on how patient the company ' s shareholders are in waiting for a return on their investment . That is another big difference between Japan and the United States : Japanese shareholders have been far more willing to hold their stakes for the long term . The short-term perspective of American shareholders , and their desire to take quick profits , is regarded as one important reason for the takeover and buyout boom in the United States. // Every month there are more huge offerings of stock here . For example , Sanwa Bank ' s announcement last week that it would issue stock to raise nearly $2. 5 billion seemed such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have made headlines in the United States , where such issues have been few and far between . The stock market crash in October 1987 marked a watershed in this capital-raising trend . In 1986 American companies raised a record $67. 9 billion from the sale of stock and similar securities - money known as equity capital . That was more than double the level in Japan that year . In 1987 the two nations were nearly equal , with slightly more than $60 billion raised in each market. // That was when the uncertainties from the market turmoil took their toll . Equity-raising in the United States withered , while it rose sharply in Japan , where the market weathered the market crash with far less volatility and a swifter recovery . A stronger economy and greater stability in shareholdings in Japan , along with the firm hand of Government regulators , helped the Japanese market hold its ground and then resume its upward course . <> <> More Than a Casino // What the contrast in the amount of newly raised capital underscores is that a strong stock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , many people criticize the Japanese market for shortcomings like high fixed commissions on trades and paltry dividend payments . In addition , extensive networks of cross-holdings , in which groups of corporations own large blocks of shares in each other , tend to reduce the voice of smaller shareholders. // But the market is performing the classical economic function of providing a means for investors to channel their savings into productive enterprises . Japanese save far more than Americans . And Japanese companies are feverishly translating that money into more productive operations. // " It ' s clear that this is helping Japanese companies in no small way , " said Richard Koo , senior economist at the Nomura Research Institute . He said that the American market , unlike the Japanese market , has devoted much more time to takeover battles rather than capital-raising. // " It ' s true that in our country the focus has been much more on asset management and not raising capital , " said John J. Phelan Jr. , chairman of the New York Stock Exchange , who is visiting Tokyo this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their economic growth rate , and it ' s looking for a home . " <> <> ' Massive Amounts ' for Banks // Particularly for commercial banks , where capital can play an even more critical role in competitive strength , the difference between the markets has been lopsided. // Since the crash of 1987 , American banks have raised $5. 7 billion in equity , according to Securities Data ; in the same period , just eight major Japanese banks have raised more than $22 billion , a study by Salomon Brothers found. // " The buoyancy and discipline of the Tokyo capital markets have enabled the banks to raise massive amounts of capital - sums beyond the wildest dreams of Western bank chiefs , " Salomon Brothers wrote in the report. // Prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange have risen spectacularly over the last decade , prompting criticism in Japan and on Wall Street that it is built on a foundation of soap bubbles that could burst at any moment . While Japanese stock prices trade on average at more than 40 times the companies ' earnings per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10 times earnings. // As a result , it takes significantly fewer shares in Japan to raise the same amount of capital . And by issuing fewer shares , there is less dilution of the holdings of existing shareholders and of the company ' s earnings per share . In other words , the lofty level of the Japanese stock market makes it far cheaper to raise equity capital . <> <> Interest Rates Low , Too // And when Japanese companies want to borrow money , they also have an advantage over American companies : Japan ' s relatively low inflation rate - less than 3. 5 percent - and low interest rates make borrowing relatively inexpensive as well. // With its strong gains , the Japanese market has defied doomsayers for more than five years , particularly during moments of enormous stress , as at the time of the crash on Oct. 19 , 1987 , and two weeks ago , when Wall Street suffered its second-biggest drop ever. // The Tokyo stock market hardly skipped a beat when the New York Stock Exchange fell nearly 7 percent on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then bounced right back , causing no delay in Sanwa Bank ' s long-planned new-share issue. // Whatever the reason for that stability - and few agree on just what is behind it - the benefits to Japanese corporations are clear. // Nowhere is the difference between the two countries more pronounced than in commercial banking , where there is a worldwide struggle to build capital to meet strict new regulatory standards and to compete in the emerging international marketplace. // A study by Merrill Lynch Japan Inc. found that since the stock market crash two years ago , Japanese banks have nearly doubled their equity capital . About three-fourths of the gainis directly related to the strength of the Japanese stock market . <> <> ' Enormous Flexibility ' // " If you can raise these funds in such massive amounts this easily , it gives you enormous flexibility in terms of expanding your business , " said James Russell , Merrill Lynch ' s banking analyst here . " This trend has all sorts of implications for even the average American company , in terms of where it ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future. " // For instance , after its just-announced offering , Sanwa Bank ' s shareholders ' equity will stand at about $11. 2 billion , more than double the $4. 5 billion at the end of March 1987. // To be sure , Japanese banks face significant hurdles in their international expansion . Their major problem is that they have grown up in a highly protected domestic market . As a result , they lag behind their foreign rivals in developing high-margin new products and more sophisticated services . But their ability to invest heavily is allowing them to close this gap quickly. // The Japanese banks have benefited in two ways from the strong stock market . The first , of course , is that they have issued new shares and billions of dollars worth of bonds that later are converted to stock . The second is that their own portfolios of stocks have sharply risen in value . <> <> The Rules Are Different // While American banks are restricted from owning shares in other companies , unless the holdings are in businesses that relate directly to their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percent of other corporations. // Historically , the Japanese banks have used their shareholdings to reinforce ties to clients and other members of integrated financial and industrial groupings , known as keiretsu . Over time the value of those holdings has exploded. // That gain has generally not been recognized , because the banks reflect only what they paid for the stock on their balance sheets . But if they sell a fraction of those shares , they realize the gains to bolster their earnings and capital base. // And that well of capital runs deep . For instance , in a recent public filing in the United States in which it had to disclose the value of its stock portfolio , Mitsubishi Bank said that as of last March 31 it had the equivalent of $28. 5 billion in unrealized stock gains , at current exchange rates . <> <> Impact of Stock Profits // Salomon Brothers estimated that Japan ' s major banks earned $7. 9 billion , or just under half of their pretax profits in the fiscal year 1988 , from selling small amounts of their stock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the $24. 4 billion increase in the shareholders ' equity of Japan ' s seven largest banks from the end of March 1987 to the end of March 1989 had been accounted for by the issuance of new shares and the sale of some stock from their portfolios. //
