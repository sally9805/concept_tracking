In three countries , a wave of soldiering and questioning <P> The struggle over the troubled future of Central America grew fiercer last week . In El Salvador , Marxist guerrillas scored a psychological triumph with a surprise raid on the country 's economic heartland ; for the first time a U.S. military adviser was wounded . In Honduras , a major display of U.S. military logistics was intended to send an intimidating message to neighboring Nicaragua 's Sandinista government . At the same time , the covert border war against the Sandinistas heated up , even though the Marxist leadership seemed more entrenched than ever . Reports from the scenes of battle : <P> EL SALVADOR . By the standards of El Salvador 's tortuous three-year civil war , the first signs of the impending debacle were small ones . As some 70 members of the country 's National Police guarded the once bustling agricultural center of Berlin ( pop . about 30,000 ) , guerrillas launched a cautious nighttime raid . For an hour small-arms fire popped back and forth between the opposing forces . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fields of Usulutn , one of El Salvador 's richest and most strategic departments . <P> But as dawn broke the next day , the guerrillas returned with a vengeance . Some 500 members of the People 's Revolutionary Army , a branch of the Marxist-led Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front ( F.M.L.N. ) , descended on Berlin . Raking the town with automatic-weapons fire and rocket-propelled grenades , they devastated the puny garrison , killing or wounding four policemen and capturing or driving away the rest . The guerrillas sacked and burned Berlin 's pharmacies and dry-goods stores , robbed the only local bank of $160,000 , and rocketed the town 's postal and telex offices . Local residents were herded into the central municipal plaza and harangued with propaganda and recruitment speeches . <P> The reaction of the U.S.-backed Salvadoran armed forces was slow and clumsy . The day after the guerrillas began their occupation , U.S.-supplied A-37B Dragonfly jets appeared over Berlin and began to strafe and rocket the town . At least two bombs were dropped a few blocks from the central plaza . Floods of refugees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , clothing and hammocks , as Red Cross ambulances , their sirens screaming , crept through the streets . <P> More than two full days after the guerrillas had captured Berlin , 1,000 Salvadoran army troops arrived to lift the siege . When relief columns neared the town , the guerrillas , true to form , melted into the nearby hills . As they retreated , they burned Berlin 's coffee warehouses , the town 's chief source of income .
