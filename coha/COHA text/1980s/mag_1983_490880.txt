THE scene is familiar . A large share of the people at the party evidently wish they were some  --  where else . You are encouraged to remember that they had other , grander plans , which did n't work out , mostly ? as they spend much of the evening explaining  --  through no fault of their own . They will tell you whose fault it was . Since they are there , they will go through the motions of doing what people are expected to do at parties . If someone holding a camera hands out funny hats , they will put them on , wearing a big grin , but will stop grin  --  ning as soon as the camera moves away . Some of those on hand may offer a diversion by calling each other ? or well-known figures who are not present  --  unpleasant names . Tempers tend to be short . Many of the company give the impression that their minds are on some future , surely more festive gathering . They may refer to the number of invitations they have had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their social life is not dependent on such boring local events . Anyone who has made it through a few such evenings would have felt at home in the corridors of City Hall during much of this year . The three New York officials who were elected on a citywide basis , Mayor Edward Koch , Comptroller Harrison Goldin , and City Council President Carol Bellamy , along with their staffs and many of the people who have cast their political lot with this trio , have all had major political disappointments , which explains why they often do n't seem to be having a high old time on the local political scene . Goldin , who when he was elect  --  ed to the State Senate in 1965 , at the age of twenty-nine , was the youngest senator in Albany history , is now serv  --  ing his third term as comptroller , but his ambition to move on to some other office has been no secret . In 1974 , in the annual musical satire put on by members of the City Hall press corps , a reporter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harrison J. Goldin , I am your boy comptroller , And when I 'm four years older , I 'll be your baby mayor . " Belying the lyrics , Goldin ran for reelection as comptroller in 1977 and , the following year , ven  --  tured into the state arena as a can  --  didate for comptroller in Albany  --  a post that he could reasonably expect might lead to the governorship , or even , by one remarkable precedent , to higher office . Historians do not assign Millard Fillmore to the upper ranks of American Presidents , but he rates very well among comptrollers : he went di rectly from being New York State comptroller to the Vice-Presidency and from there to the White House . Contrary to most predictions , Goldin lost the 1978 race to the Republican candidate , Edward Regan , but that was not his only political disaster con nected with that election . Several months later , serious questions were raised about his soliciting campaign funds from one of the owners of a company that , at about the same time , had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bus shelters for the city . The charge was that the specifications drawn up by Goldin 's office had been tailored to assure that the winning bidder would be his generous contribu tor . Over the years , the city comp troller has been the man who asks city agencies unwelcome questions about where the money went , pesters them with hit-and-run audits , and generally makes life as uncomfortable as possible for the mayor 's end of City Hall . The job worked out well politically for Goldin 's predecessor as comptroller , Abraham Beame , who in 1973 was elected mayor  --  whereupon Comptrol ler Goldin made Beame 's life as un comfortable as possible . In the matter of the bus-shelter franchise , it was the mayor  --  Koch , in this case  --  who had the chance to ask unwel come questions . The bus-shelter negotia tions halted  --  all these years later , the fran chise has still not been awarded  --  and Koch turned the problem over to his commis sioner of investigation , Stanley Lupkin . It was n't until two and a half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conclud ed that Gold in 's ac tions had had " the appearance of impro priety and favoritism , " although the evidence fell short of that need ed for formal charges . During this long non rush to judgment , Goldin , who , in the tradition , had previ ously been a big pain to Koch , mostly lay low , giving the Mayor almost nothing to complain about . He was also po  --  litically immobilized . There was no danger that he would do anything to give Koch a hard time in the 1981 municipal elections . If , after the re  --  lease of the report , which he accepted as an exoneration , he had had any idea of taking a flyer in the 1982 state elec  --  tions , the announcement early in the year that Koch would be a candidate fur governor preempted that space . The Mayor 's decision also spoiled the plans of Miss Bellamy . She had al  --  ready passed around the word that she would be running for statewide office  --  either for governor or for comptrol  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the governor 's race , in which it was widely assumed that he was headed for an easy victory , seemed to promise her a free ride to the top post in city government , and she stayed out of the statewide election . Koch 's startling Democratic-primary loss to Mario Cuomo , who went on to win the general election , meant that Miss Bellamy , whose political allies were already leaking the names of who would be in and who would he out in the new Bellamy administration , was trapped in the cramped quarters of City Council president  --  an office that is relatively powerless , except for its vote , which is equal to those of the mayor and the comptroller , on the Board of Estimate . The cruelest ad  --  justments of all were those that had to be made by the Mayor and his close associates , many of whom , in roseate moments , had allowed themselves to envision a future that involved a brief stop in Albany and then a shift to Washington and the Vice-Presiden  --  cy  --  or even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MOVE : WILL NEW YORK 'S MAYOR END UP IN THE WHITE HOUSE ? " was the title of the cover story in the Boston Globe magazine for September 19 , 1982 , four days before the primary . ) Even though Koch keeps reminding his supporters and everyone else  --  that New York is the greatest city in the world , after last year 's dazzling vistas they are bound to feel constricted within the perimeters of the five boroughs . THE low spirits at City Hall are , to a degree , a reaction to the jubilant sounds coming out of Al  --  bany as the new governor gives the impression that he is having the time of his life overseeing every detail of state government  --  a process that is interrupted at intervals as he takes calls conveying the blandishments of Democratic leaders , including Presi  --  dential candidates , assuring him of the brightness of his national political fu  --  ture . The continuing happy hour in Albany is a party to which it is unlike  --  ly that many City Hall officials will of  --  ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occasions . Every few days , there is some new indication that Cuomo , for all his air of enlightened benevolence , has n't forgiven a single harsh syllable uttered against him during last year 's primary campaign , in which Koch , who had defeated him in the 1977 race for mayor , por  --  trayed him as one of life 's losers . Despite their own sharp differ  --  ences with the Mayor over the years , Goldin and Miss Bellamy joined nearly all the prominent Democratic leaders in the city and state in giving Koch their strong endorsement . On Primary Night , there was a curious develop  --  ment . Goldin was with the Mayor at his headquarters , at the Sheraton Centre Hotel , at Fifty-second Street and Seventh Avenue , as Koch made a graceful concession speech , urging his supporters to " be happy for Mario . " At Cuomo 's headquarters , in the Hal  --  loran House , at Lexington Avenue and Forty-ninth Street , his supporters surged forward to hear their can  --  didate 's response . Many of them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what had been seen as a doomed cause against a powerful incumbent officeholder , seemed almost as stunned in victory as the crowd around Koch appeared to he in defeat . Suddenly , those at the Halloran House were star  --  tled to see the slight figure of the city comptroller edging his way purpose  --  fully along the front row of the small stage and into the winner 's circle . Having made a quick dash across town , Goldin , in the glare of the television lights , leaned over and seemed to be about to kiss Cuomo 's pretty wife , Matilda , when strong men intervened . Now the question is whither polit  --  ically for the city 's three top officials , whose trade has been politics most of their adult lives . The next guberna  --  torial election is n't until 1986 , when the three Democrats will have to run against an incumbent of their own party . Cuomo has insisted that he will keep his campaign vow to serve out his full four-year term . Since the next Presidential election  --  assuming that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not until 1988 , he would surely run for reelection as governor . In last year 's primary campaign , Koch frequently compared his own impres  --  sive achievements as mayor with Cuomo 's eight years as secretary of state and , later , as lieutenant gov  --  governor  --  assignments that involved more ceremony than substance . The Mayor made the point so often that , as he finished the summing-up for his side in a campaign debate in Buffalo , Cuomo chimed in , and the two men concluded Koch 's gibing message in unison : " And you , Mario , have no record . " Cuomo is deter  --  mined that no one will be able to accuse him of not having stayed with the governorship long enough to establish a record . To demonstrate that he has n't been distracted from his duties by the gratifying national clamor , he has announced that he will not even leave the state except to handle matters of urgent concern to his constituents . So far , he has been unmoved by reminders that no one ap  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cleveland , that he made a successful run or the Presidency in the year after he arrived at the state capital . For ambitious local officeholders of a certain eminence , prospects for ad  --  vancement in Washington are not promising , either . A seat in the House of Representatives would not be con  --  sidered a step upward ( Koch stepped up from there when he got to be mayor ) , and one of New York 's sena  --  tors , Daniel Patrick Moynihan , was just reelected to a new six-year term . The seat of the state 's Republican senator , Alfonse D'Amato , is not at risk until 1986 . In any event , since D'Amato took office he and Koch have been so handy with the mutual com  --  pliments that some pol-watchers refer to the combination as " the Ed and Fonz show , " and a Koch campaign to unseat the Senator would have to be a classic study in revisionism . The Mayor has now officially reverted to his pre-1982 position that his only am  --  bition is to run in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amendment that after that he might run for a fourth term . Meanwhile , Goldin and Miss Bellamy are all dressed up for political advancement with , at the moment , no place to go . It is a strong possibility that after reviewing their options the three could end up , two years from now , running against each other for the city 's top job  --  which now pays a hundred and ten thousand dollars annually  --  although City Hall is the place that each of them has at some point tried hard to break out of . Often , the three-way contest appears to be already under way . Every few days , it seems , one of the three will throw a press conference taking credit for some newsworthy accomplishment , which is followed by angry cries of credit snatching from one or both of the others . Goldin 's aggressive chal  --  lenging of the Mayor in the attention-seeking department is already a fa  --  miliar number on the City Hall enter  --  tainment schedule . Koch complained that Goldin  --  the baby mayor is now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ribbon-cutting cere  --  monies , adding , jocularly , that he even brought his own scissors . Goldin noy , amuses himself by flashing his scissors as he arrives at such events . At one point this summer , there was a demon  --  stration in the City Hall plaza of the Police Department 's use of attack dogs . Several times a week , City Hall is the scene of shows that boost the stock of various city departments , local businesses , or ethnic groups and reap publicity for one politician or an  --  other  --  most often for the Mayor . This is not only because he is in charge but because his wonderfully mobile face adds a much-admired comic touch : for example , his mock-manic expression , a few days ago , as he donned a huge sombrero to pro  --  claim Mexico Week . A dog act , how  --  ever , is a comparatively rare event . When Goldin turned up , the Mayor commented that the least he could have done was bring his own attack dog . WHEN you 're not having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dress , a wholesome remedy is to get out of town from time to time . However , the Mayor had a more serious reason for announcing early last month that he would be making a series of appear  --  ances around the country . He ex  --  plained that he would be doing his best to save the Democratic Party from certain defeat in next year 's Presiden  --  tial election by persuading it to attend to the concerns of the middle class in  --  stead of " pandering " to " left wing " special-interest groups . The Demo cratic Party 's left wing " does n't give a rap about the middle class , " he said . A Koch speech later in August , in San Francisco , the only one of the series that he has given so far , hit this note exactly and was well received by mem  --  bers of the Commonwealth Club , a local civic group . The " special-inter  --  est extremists " whose " narrow agen  --  da " Koch said that his fellow-Demo  --  crats must reject in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " mainstream " included unduly ag  --  gressive supporters of the Equal Rights Amendment and of a nuclear freeze , and advocates of " overly cautious and unrealistic " environmental policies . In pursuit of his theme that the Demo  --  cratic Presidential candidates must change their tune or perish , the Mayor labelled their positions as , variously , " radical , " " ridiculous , " and " asinine " and accused them of relying on ideological romanticism rather than good American common sense . Most of the members of the San Francisco audience were presumably unaware that what they were hearing was a re-argument of the 1982 gubernatorial contest in this state , in which women , proponents of a nuclear freeze , and environmentalists , as well as blacks , Hispanics , union members , classic lib  --  erals , and Cuomo 's fellow Italian-Americans , in an alliance that they may have believed to be part of an American mainstream , helped sweep Cuomo to victory over Koch in the primary and , later , over the millionaire businessman Lewis Lehrman in the general election . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his side of things , having persuaded him  --  self that last year 's returns in his home state had been an aberration . New York , after all , was not America  --  a proposition with which he would find little disagreement in what is thought of locally as the Great Out There . However , he also indicated to San Francisco reporters that there was some hope for his home state . He said that his great mistake in the primary had been in not stressing to New York voters his philosophy on , for example , narrow agendas versus the concerns of the middle class If he had done so , he said , he might well have won . In fact , his position as the candidate of middle  --  of-the-roaders as opposed to Cuomo 's allegedly extremist supporters was fre  --  quently invoked during the 1982 cam  --  paign , as it had been back in his first mayoral race , in 1977 , when the con  --  cerns of the middle class were men  --  tioned so often that Cuomo , referring to Koch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Eddie thinks being mid  --  dle class is a bachelor making $57,500 a year . " Since the policies of Ronald Reagan were not really at issue in Koch 's San Francisco speech ( although the President had also been denouncing the Democrats for catering to " special in  --  terests " ) , Koch directed only a few passing jabs at the President , and some listeners took his basic message to be that if the Democrats did n't shape up as he suggested the voters might just as well stick with the incumbent Presi  --  dent . The next day , the Mayor at  --  tracted local media attention as he sampled roast pork in San Francisco 's Chinatown and shrimp and crab at Fisherman 's Wharf . A few hours ear  --  lier , he had spoken at a breakfast meet  --  ing of a San Francisco Jewish group . He had previously called Reagan 's policies toward Israel far superior to those of Jimmy Carter . Had Carter been reelected , Koch told the breakfast gathering , " Israel would have been sold out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no good . Not only on Is  --  rael  --  he was just no good . " He said that although he had supported the Democratic Presidential candidate in 1980 , he had done so while " holding my nose . " The admiring verdict on the visiting New Yorker of one Com  --  monwealth Club member was " He comes across like an arch-conserva  --  tive . He 's the most sensible politician I know . " Understandably , Koch 's message brought him no outpouring of grati  --  tude from the Democratic Presidential candidates . The conservative colum  --  nist ' William Rusher , describing him as " one of the nation 's shrewdest poli  --  ticians , " commended him for his as  --  tuteness . His philosophy so appealed to William F. Buckley , Jr. , that the columnist , quoting Koch 's statement that he was a Democrat and would al  --  ways be a Democrat , referred to a joke about a devout Englishman and a Scotsman ; the punchline was " Mon , have you no ambition ? " The fact that Koch 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paid by his 1985 reelection committee , as a means , it seemed , of making sure that his message got to the five boroughs  --  seemed to be more popular among Re  --  publicans than among Democrats came as no surprise to anyone who had had access to some polls taken this summer by Bill Johnson for the Post on the popularity of Reagan and of Koch . They had shown striking parallels be  --  tween the ratings , favorable and un  --  favorable , given the two men by vari  --  ous voting blocs . Not only did both do very poorly among blacks but in both cases their support was relatively un  --  enthusiastic among older people , the less affluent , those with the least schooling , the most highly educated , and women . According to a Johnson poll , if the mayoral race were held then the most formidable candidate against Koch  --  far more so than Gol  --  din or than any of the black or His  --  panic leaders who believe that 1985 will be the year when they will make the big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Mayor re  --  turned from his San Francisco trip , a front-page headline in the Times was " HEALTH CRISIS FOUND BY NEW YORK STATE IN TWO HOTELS IN CITY . " At the urging of a Legal Aid Society lawyer , a medical team was sent to investigate conditions in two of the fifty local hotels to which the city had assigned over two thousand wel  --  fare families  --  about eight thousand people in all , most of them small chil  --  dren and their mothers  --  who had been evicted from or burned out of their former homes . The hotels must be used because there are tin apart  --  ments available for such families at the legal rate of two hundred and eighteen dollars a month for a family of four . The cost for so-called emergency housing in the hotels  --  emergencies sometimes last for over a year  --  is about twelve hundred dollars a month for a family of that size , half of the sum being paid by the federal govern  --  ment and a quarter each by the state and the city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which was released by the State Department of Health , many of the children in the hotels were " more than malnourished . They were weak , underweight , apathetic , dis  --  eased , and suffering from serious and possibly irreversible physical and men  --  tal impediments . " There was mention of a seven-month-old girl who weighed only nine pounds , of one crib for twenty families , and of roaches , rats , and urine-stained bedding , despite the huge rents . Although city social work  --  ers were assigned to the hotels , many of the children had not been going to school . Calling the conditions " Dick  --  ensian , " the Governor was also quoted as saying that although it " is theoret  --  ically a city management problem ... I said do everything that needs to he done immediately .... I said get food in there . " " THE SHAME OF THE CITY " was the headline over a News editorial the next day which charged that Koch and his associates " lack genuine cern and compassion . " A Times de @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Koch entreated Democrats around the country to pay more attention to the middle class , he and other top city and state officials last week inadvertently rediscovered pov  --  erty . " Koch 's response was to deny that many of the children in the hotels were malnourished . " KIDS HUNGRY ? ED DOUBTS /T " was the Post headline . If they were , the Mayor said , it was not the city 's responsibility but that of their parents , who , he suggested , were spending food money  --  since the ho  --  tels provide no cooking facilities , the families receive about two dollars a day per person to eat in restaurants  --  on expensive stereo sets . " It takes peo  --  ple to put the smell of urine there , " the Mayor added , and he reminded report  --  ers , " Look , these are third-rate hotels , they 're not palaces . But they are com  --  parable to the accommodations these people came from when they were burned out or evicted , and that means they are apartments the middle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind was boggled again . " Is the Mayor saying we should be satisfied with this ? " he asked . Goldin quickly reminded re  --  porters that he had released an audit last December that questioned the city 's arrangements for welfare fami  --  lies . Carol Bellamy introduced a res  --  olution before the Board of Estimate pointing out that during the current fiscal year it would cost forty million dollars to house welfare families in such hotels and proposing a series of stringent changes and specifications that the hotel owners must comply with in order to be eligible for such funds . Since then , more social workers have been assigned to the hotels . At Cuomo 's suggestion , the city has an  --  nounced a plan to condemn such ho  --  tels , take them over , and try to im  --  prove conditions , using the large sums previously paid in rents . Whether , some months from now , the lives of the children in such places will truly be better , no one can tell , but there is a terrible sense that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have been done at all . Although one of the problems in locating permanent apartments for welfare Families was that the rental limit , set by the state , was not high enough , the Mayor mentioned that even if it were much higher many landlords would not rent to such families , believing that they cause buildings and neighborhoods to deteri  --  orate , and that the city could not force them to do so . A couple of weeks later , he made it clear that the city , too , was not enthusiastic about such tenants . At a ceremony dedicating the first seventy-two of a planned four hundred and forty frame houses to be built by the city with federal assistance in the Coney Island section of Brooklyn , he said , to the applause of onlookers , that his predecessors at City Hall had used the neighborhood as a " dumping ground " for welfare families , and that in the future when public-housing units in the area became vacant many of them should be rented to the so-called working poor , rather than to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with one of the newly built small houses , which were surrounded by abandoned buildings , that he asked , " When can I move in ? " " As soon as you vacate Gracie Mansion , " said Comptroller Goldin , who had just arrived on the scene , scissors at the ready . ALTHOUGH the Mayor is assidu  --  ous in his attendance at parades , sometimes making a welcome appear  --  ance at three or four ethnic or neigh  --  borhood festivals in a single day , for the last two years he has been booed at one of the biggest of these local events , the Labor Day Parade . This month , he skipped it , leaving the place at the head of the march to the Governor , whom the union members  --  as they keep reminding him  --  did so much to elect . Instead , Koch spent the time with friends on Long Island . During the Labor Day weekend , he was in  --  vited to a big fund-raising party for Judith Hope , who is running for supervisor of the Town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ referred to the challenge she would face , if elected , in trying to cope with the proliferation of real-estate devel  --  opment in the community . Koch , in his remarks , assured the guests , as a number of them reported later , " If I were governor , I would settle this matter as I do as mayor . I would do it administratively . I would issue an order . " Perhaps jokingly , he added , " Of course , it was your will that I should n't go to Albany . " At the words " If I were governor , " there were sounds from the crowd  --  murmurs of excitement , a few groans . The political  --  cal ramble ai n't restful . ? ANDY LOGAN ?
