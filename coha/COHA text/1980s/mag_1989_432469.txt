 |p604  IN LENINGRAD I met a defector from America . He was wearing sunglasses , sitting alone on a small towel beside the Neva River , by the walls of the Peter and Paul Fortress where Leningrad insiders swim and play volleyball on weekends . He had lived in the Soviet Union for 28 years . A Russian friend pointed him out : " He is from San Francisco . Perhaps he will want to talk with you . " The defector was a bland man , with a face that betrayed no content . " What did you do in the States ? " I asked him . " National Security Agency . " I told him I was born just a few hundred miles down the coast , in Estonia , and fled west during World War II with my parents . " We went opposite ways , " he said , smiling . " I guess all cultures have their defects . " In Leningrad I met a lady . She was sitting at the hard-currency bar of the Hotel Moscow , sipping gin . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she was a cardiologist by profession . But the lady was also a prostitute . In one night she could easily make $250 , the average monthly salary of a physician in the Soviet Union . " You are looking at me , " she said abruptly , " and saying , Poor doctor ! ' Well , this is what our system does . And now , now we can say it . " Her words spat across the table . In Leningrad I met an admiral . He was commander of the Leningrad naval base . In a VIP boat we followed his launch down the Neva to celebrate Navy Day , past four destroyers and three submarines lined up for inspection , each with its brass band , each with its sailors stiff in dress formation . " How is it , comrades ? " the admiral shouted through a bullhorn at each ship . " Rah , rah , rah ! " the sailors shouted back in unison . That evening we photographed the fireworks over the Neva from the roof of the admiralty building , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Strings of lights outlined the warships below , and the bronze statues atop the Winter Palace of the tsars stood black against the rockets ' red glare . " What 's going on around here ? " the admiral had demanded . " We have n't let even our own photographers on this building , and now we have American journalists ? Up there ? ... Well , why not ? " THESE ARE HEADY , risky days on the eastern Baltic , front lines of the Soviet experiments in openness ( glasnost ) and restructuring ( perestroika ) . What was closed is open ; what was secret lies revealed . Palms sweat among those who have held power by fear or graft . Officials throw up their hands , unsure of the new rules . Soviet society has never been on such display . Leningrad , Russia 's traditional window on the West , finds the world peering back in fascination . In the Baltic States of Estonia , Latvia , and Lithuania , three of the Soviet Union 's fifteen constituent republics , last year 's most dangerous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moscow has come the admission that , yes , after all , the Soviet Union occupied these nations by force in 1940 , against the will of the people . Estonia has declared itself a sovereign state and is drafting ambitious plans for economic autonomy . The old national flag , stripes of blue , black , and white , a one-way ticket to Siberia only last May , waves over farmhouses . Emotions fly between euphoria and cynicism in Estonia . Many fear a short spring , the rumble of tanks . Others sense the beginning of the disintegration of the Soviet Union as a colonial power . A consensus prevails that there is no alternative to radical change . Like Peter the Great , the Russian tsar who imported Western architects to build Leningrad on the marshes of the Neva , Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev must reach out . He needs Western technology and expertise to prop up his foundering @#  |p605  giant before it sinks into Third World status . Six industrial nations ? Finland , Sweden , Denmark , West Germany , East Germany , and Poland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Soviet Union . Now the careful equations that have governed business , diplomacy , and military balance among them have been altered in three short years , and in one bold summer . The Baltic has been a buffer zone and a battleground between East and West since the days of the Vikings , with seafaring tribes sacking each other in a cycle of cruelty and revenge . Only for a brief two centuries in the Middle Ages did a Baltic community coalesce , under the Hanseatic League of prosperous cities that valued trade over plunder . Since then , East and West have pursued their violence with the usual zest , culminating with Adolf Hitler and Joseph Stalin dividing people and nations between them as if they were cattle . The Baltic remains on military alert , grouped into three forces : NATO , with Denmark and West Germany ; the Warsaw Pact , with East Germany , Poland , and the Soviet Union ; and two skittish neutrals , Finland and Sweden , gamely in the wings . The sea has become a chessboard for their maneuvers , patrols @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each side monitoring the other into a kind of half-cordial , grudging stalemate that wastes millions of dollars and thrives more on momentum than on crisis . Deep suspicions remain between nations , and generals still talk like generals , but the thaw in the East has offered new hope ; the Soviets have declared that the Cold War is over . And now a common enemy ? pollution promises to press the littoral nations of the Baltic into common cause . Environmental scientists already talk like citizens of a community . What I began last spring as a story of confrontation has turned into a story of optimism . My journey starts on the blank page of the frozen Gulf of Bothnia between Sweden and Finland , about a hundred miles south of the Arctic Circle . On this foggy morning we fly by helicopter from the Finnish town of Oulu over farmhouses and birch forests , droning out to sea over an open 605  |p613  channel bobbing with ice curds . At noon we intercept one of the world 's most modern icebreakers , the six-story , 30,000-horsepower Otso @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decks I would have eaten scrambled eggs . The Otso crushes rather than cuts the ice , bellying up on the sheet with enormous mass . The ice crumbles off in shards , the smaller ones churning in the wake and flashing shades of green as the seawater soaks through their layer of snow . Cracks rip off into the horizon , zigzagging as if they were chased . In our wake is the Polish freighter Eugenie Cotton , fast for Kemi for a load of paper pulp . In hard winters national flags and borders have little meaning to traffic on the Baltic . Under a pragmatic agreement among the seven nations , their combined 34 icebreakers are shifted around from an office in Helsinki just by a few phone calls : " Say , Ivan , we need your boys over in Sweden . " At night we sit high on the bridge , hypnotized by the pale lights of the computer and radar screens and the deep , steady rumble . The moon and Venus hang like ornaments in the cold . Sibelius is on the tape deck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and are headed for the galaxies , warm , powerful , in charge . Even in normal winters , thick ice grips the  |p614  sea as far south as the Swedish island of Gotland . " If we stop for a day , " says First Officer Christian Wennerstrand , " we have chaos . " Finland , the world 's only nation with no ice-free ports , builds more than half the world 's icebreakers , many for the Soviet Union . Finns regard perestroika with caution . Already faced with shrinking orders in a bleak era for European shipbuilding , they must now deal with the economic instability of one of their biggest customers . Says Pekka Laine , president of Wartsila Marine Industries , Finland 's largest ship maker , " There is no longer just one market in the U.S.S.R. , but many . In Murmansk , for example , the decisions to buy are made on site , rather than in Moscow . " Finland signed the Treaty of Friendship , Cooperation , and Mutual Assistance with the Soviet Union in 1948 . In exchange for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Union through her territory . Finlandization has become a generic term for one nation 's accommodations with a neighboring superpower and is sometimes used to suggest a kind of national castration . Said Finnish Prime Minister Harri Holkeri when he visited Washington , D. C. , last summer , " From the depths of my heart , I hate that term . " Culturally and economically Finland is a Western nation . But would the Finns fight if the Soviets tried to use Finnish territory as a springboard to attack NATO ? " We would damn sure defend ourselves , " Finnish Vice Adm . Jan Klenberg says succinctly at General Headquarters in Helsinki . " We have to make it clear that it is not possible to use Finnish territory . " We know we would n't win another war ? but we are prepared to fight . " An acid mix of pride and frustration rises in his throat . " They test us from both sides ? both NATO and Warsaw Pact . Almost every day we send up interceptors .

For many years Finland even had serious Communists . But I see in the newspaper , while sitting at McDonald 's on Mannerheim Street , that Arvo Aalto , head of the Finnish Communist Party , plans to resign next week because the party suffered heavy financial losses in the stock market . FROM HELSINKI 'S South Harbor , the Baltic 's elegant car-and-passenger ferries put forth to Leningrad , Gdansk , Travemunde , and my own destination , Stockholm via the Aland Islands , an overnight cruise that threads an island world of pine forest and granite . The ferries make money . Slot machines occupy the idle . Duty-free shops push cognac and silk scarves . A ten-piece band pumps waltzes over a smorgasbord rich in herring . On the deck gentlemen Swedes in gray suits stroll like storks , with their hands folded behind their backs , saying , " Yaw , yaw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between Finland and Sweden , 23,000 Alanders fly their own flag and lick their own Aland Islands postage stamps . They speak Swedish but belong to Finland , which is responsible for their defense . Formerly a Swedish province , the islands petitioned to be returned to Sweden as the Russian Empire disintegrated in 1917 , but the League of Nations honored the Finnish claim and confirmed  |p616  the islands ' status as a military-free zone . Their history bristles with sea captains and merchant sailing fleets , and today Glanders own many of the ferry lines ? Viking , Birka , Eckero ? that haul more than eight million passengers each year in the Baltic . Through the tax-free sales they have prospered . " We are a privileged people , " an Alands gas station owner tells me . " There 's no poverty here , no racism , because there are no guest workers . ' There 's almost no serious crime , few drugs . I would n't go anywhere else . " And what can be sweeter than early summer in the Alands ? The spangle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grass , apple blossoms , and lilacs . Queen Anne 's lace that billows beside country roads like snowdrifts . And shocks of dandelions growing brazenly in the long daylight , their thick , hollow stems wet as rhubarb . STOCKHOLM ARRIVES in the early morning , through mist and a maze of small islands , with a skyline of church spires and sailboat masts , their sharpness always reaching toward heaven . The city rests on 14 islands , clinging by tentacles of bridges and causeways to the rocks . Half the city lies @#  |p617  beside Lake Malaren , half beside the Baltic . Swedes are a confident people . Sweden has not warred for 175 years . With no pain to endure , no heroes to worship , no warriors to bury , they have a human advantage : They carry no self-hate and so are not apt to hate others . They seem indifferent to defense . Says air force Lt. Col. Gosta Edwards , " Society looks at us as if we do n't belong . " But bad things happen to nice people . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prime minister Olof Palme three years ago . And for the past nine years they have been plagued by foreign @# submarines , arrogantly , systematically , probing their coastal waters . No one knows why . Training ? Espionage ? One Danish naval officer theorized that the Soviet Union is getting navigational fixes on the Swedish coast so it can hide nuclear submarines in case of war and push the buttons from there . " They know now that the Swedes ca n't find them , " he told me . Since 1981 , when a Soviet Whiskey-class sub ran aground near the Swedish naval base at Karlskrona , no physical evidence has been found , no foreigners confronted . With photographs of bottom-crawling mini-sub tracks 617  |p618  creeping within a few miles of Stockholm , and night sightings of frogmen , the hunt has taken on the comic overtones of the Loch Ness monster . The Swedish Navy has lost face . With the loss has come a new toughness . " I 'm in charge of military readiness , " Swedish Army Brig . Gen. Bertel Osterdahl tells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that gives me trouble from time to time . There 's quite a lot of activity in this area , and we have to act too , just to show that we are present . " " But what happens , " I ask , " if you actually destroy a submarine and have Russian or Polish bodies floating in Stockholm Harbor ? " " In our territorial waters we 'll shoot without warning , " he replies . To see the complexity of the submarine chase , you must sail an archipelago of 25,000 islands , past thousands of granite skerries flush with blueberries , past summer hideaways and small boys fishing on piers , through waters thick with sonar-foiling thermal layers , inconsistent salinity , and erratic bottoms , and extending hundreds of miles on a coastline as long as from Long Island to Key West in North America . " The Baltic is good for submarine warfare , " says Comdr . Carl-Gustaf Dybeck of the  |p619  Swedish Navy . " In some parts of the year it 's almost impossible to hunt submarines except with other subs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we sail out one morning on H.M.S. Umed , a Swedish sub hunter powered by Rolls-Royce aircraft engines and carrying a payload of eight Swedish RBS-15 missiles and six torpedoes . The timed is part of a ten-ship joint exercise . It is the fastest conventional ship in the Baltic , like a greyhound at 38 knots in rough seas , streaking through narrow passages , spilling our wake on the rocks . Comdr . Anders Stavberg , head of the squadron , joins me on deck as I grip the railing : " Only a helicopter can follow us along . In two hours we can reach Soviet waters with missiles ; it 's only five hours south for action against Poland and East Germany . " " But what about these subs ? " I ask . The commander winces . " It 's a little irritating that sic , May 1989 The Baltic : Arena of Power we ca n't do it better .

" In the wardroom of the timed we feast on roast pork , lingonberries , and steamed potatoes . Says the ship 's skipper , Lt. Comdr . C. A. Klingspor , " Frankly this sub crisis has put such a strain on the navy , no one has had time to take care of wife and family . Two weeks out , a weekend in . Living on a small craft . They 've been holding seminars to help families stay together . " THE BALTIC is not a lonely sea . Joining the military parade are thousands of fishing boats , yachts and freighters , crisscrossing ferries , tankers , scows , research vessels , reefer ships , and transatlantic merchant vessels flying Liberian flags . From West Germany , daily " butter ships " selling groceries carry Hausfrauen back and forth to Denmark at nominal charge , so they can save @# @# some money on tax-free food and get a good chat in too . Robinson Crusoe would have been picked up and been back home by Friday . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guards the Baltic like a sentinel . Its most easterly outpost is the island of Bornholm , an early-warning platform for NATO intelligence . When a Soviet cruiser eases out of Kaliningrad Harbor , on the Baltic 's southeastern coast , it announces itself to the entire Western world . On Bornholm , Comdr . Ole Bretting picks up an echo from the cruiser 's hull on his radar and sets the process of snoopversus-snoop in motion . " We 'll shadow along and identify her , " Bretting says . " A Danish patrol craft will hand her over to a West German boat that will follow her through the Danish straits . A helicopter will go out to take pictures . Finally she 'll be handed over to the Norwegians . This is daily life . The Red Navy has grown to disproportionate size . It 's their lake . But we can pinpoint all the ships to see if there is an incoming or outgoing trend . If there 's an outgoing trend , something is going on in the world .

Like many parts of the Baltic , Bornholm was occupied first by Germany , then by the Soviet Union in the shifting fronts of World War II . Old fisherman Svend Clausen remembers : " One man hung his best suit of clothes on the apple tree outside . If they bomb the house , ' he said , at least I 'll have my suit . ' " Mr. Clausen deals rather briskly with German tourists : " They ask me where to go . You must know , ' I tell them . You did n't ask directions in 1940 .

Once the German Baltic coast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the early 1900s whose physical-culture movement was preempted by the Hitler Youth and muddled with their notions of Aryan supremacy . After the war West Germans had to rediscover their culture , and restoration of beach life at Travemunde , north of the old @#  |p621  city of Lubeck , was one of the first steps . Since then , the Ostsee , or East Sea ? as the Germans call the Baltic ? has become a sort of German New Jersey shore , a frugal choice for the holidays . The region is suffering a mild depression , despite the 70,000 ships that annually use the Kiel Canal to bypass the Danish straits for Baltic ports . Lubeck alone has lost 12,000 laboring jobs in the past 15 years , many in the shipbuilding industry . North of Kiel I wander along a beach where the shoreline is hacked off by the sea and the prevailing west winds as if by a butcher knife , leaving half a barley field , half a cow pasture . Offshore oil derricks sit like docked aircraft carriers in the haze . On a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? beach baskets ? of Travemunde , cocoons against the brisk wind .

The East German guard tower stands in the distance . I walk down the fence , along the shoreline of a tidepool . Behind me a West German border guard leads his attack dog . He stops to smoke and throw a stick into the water , which the beast chases with foolish enthusiasm . WHEN HERMANN AXEN , a leader of the Communist party in the German Democratic Republic GDR ) , came to Washington last spring , he said quite bluntly : " You can not mix socialism and capitalism , as you can not mix fire and water . " To be a German is burden enough . To be a German Communist carries a double stigma that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nation that could . Because East Germany has made communism work better than anyone else , they remain cold to the pressure for glasnost and perestroika and deny the failure such radical restructuring implies . @#  |p623  Says Dieter Noll , director of the port of Rostock , " There are many people who have two opinions ? one private and one official . I 'm not rich enough to have two opinions ; official ones have served me well . " Noll , an impatient , broad-shouldered man , has no time for doubt ; more than 3,800 ships a year pass in and out of his harbor , bearing the commerce of a nation : pulp and paper from Finland , chemicals from Latvia ; trucks to Vietnam , rolls of steel plate to the Third World , urea and rock salt to the United States . Nearly 44 percent of all cargo involves the Soviet Union ; 10 percent is transit goods for the landlocked European interior ? Czechoslovakia , Hungary , Austria . " At the end of the 1950s , " Noll says with pride , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Lubeck were already world renowned . We built this from scratch into one of the largest seaports on the Baltic . " Noll scoffs at the prospect of independent trade unions like Solidarity in Poland . " Bargaining ? " he asks . " The word bargaining ' is a foreign one ; we do not use this word . If the trade unions in our harbor want anything improved , they simply apply to the management . I 've never heard a discussion ? like in Poland ? that they would demand more . " Dieter Kuntze , 38 , lives in a four-room flat with his wife and two sons , within sight of the crane he operates for the harbor . He has been selected by the collective for this interview , but he is his own man . " We sometimes make a show ? as if everything is great , " he begins . " This is not right , huh ? " They could use a better stereo system , says Dieter , and the furniture is a bit old , but living standards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Greece or Portugal . Even the long years of defensive isolationism seem numbered . In 1988 East Germans were permitted seven million trips to the West . Such travel is on the hostage system , of course ; a family member must stay behind . Still , defections were quite high to West Germany . " Those who have left have to prove to me that they have it better on the outside , " Mrs. Kuntze says defiantly . " I have my job , and it 's good wages . There 's something on the table every day . If there is some lack , someone has not done the people 's work . " " Well , " says Dieter , " in our society those who do n't work well get paid as much as those who do , and that 's a big problem . People are lazy . But when you have competition , you have to get up early in the morning . " Mrs. Kuntze seems alarmed at her husband 's drift .

" THE PLAINS of Mecklenburg around the medieval Hanseatic town of Rostock always grew their cabbages , potatoes , and stubborn Junkers , landowners who resisted change and kept north Germany too long in military feudalism . The roads are lined with trees , like soldiers planted at attention . Fields are bemedaled with scarlet poppies . In the evening , fog rises from the land , and families of wild boar snort along the forest edge . Not a billboard desecrates the open road . There is a sad nostalgia in the landscape , like a faded picture book that shows the innocence of better times . My eyes sting from the soft coal burned for heating and industry and from the exhaust of inefficient two-stroke East German auto engines . I ask the head of the famous health spa @#  |p625  at Heiligendamm , famous for asthma cures , how he and other doctors can pressure the government to clean up the air .

In a claustrophobic nation the seashore is the chance to breathe free . Thousands elbow into health spas , campgrounds , and beaches . Holidays are organized and monitored by trade unions ; many have their own low-cost resort dormitories on the coast . Governmentorganized nudist beaches and camps rival " textile beaches " in number . Vacations on the Baltic are highly prized but available to the average worker only once in three years or so .

First of all , he has been without his royal crown since 1945 . Second , his breed is dying in the Baltic , because the fish the eagles feed on are contaminated . Only five nests survive in the park . The Baltic is burdened by 70 million people and their massive industrial output . The sea is sluggish and virtually tideless , much like a lake . Its salinity is replenished largely by storms that force North Sea water through the Danish straits . Such a flush is vital to marine life in the Baltic , but the sea has remained stagnant now for a record ten years . Its deeper layers have spent their oxygen , and some areas are completely devoid of life .

Some species of wildlife , such as Baltic seals , have been brought to the edge of extinction . Last summer , for the first time , most of the beaches on the Baltic were closed . Yet the Baltic is not the most polluted sea in the world . Says Estonian environmentalist Harald Velner , " It is merely the most examined . " In 1988 Professor Velner was executive secretary of the main group of examiners , the Helsinki Commission , the permanent committee established to implement the Convention on the Protection of the Marine Environment of the Baltic Sea Area ? an extraordinary working agreement signed in 1974 by all seven Baltic nations . The commission is chaired in turn by professionals from each nation and meets annually .

Most are due on line by 1992 . Says Anna Trzosinska of the Institute of Meteorology and Water Management in Gdynia , " Sixty percent of our nutrient input comes from agriculture . In heavy rains it 's just drainage off the land . We will never reach this 50 percent removal . . . . All the countries will have trouble making it .

Only Lithuania successfully kept its ethnic population , at 80 percent . Now Russification is open to criticism . Many speak of a national rebirth . All this has been a calculated gamble , roughly choreographed by the Kremlin . Estonia , Latvia , and Lithuania were independent parliamentary democracies for 22 years .

For many , support for perestroika is only the first step toward the national dream , to rid the nation of its Vandals and Visigoths . Moscow may have underestimated the impact of offering such people free speech . PHOTOGRAPHER Cotton Coulson and I were the first Americans in decades to visit Neringa , on the delicate pinescented sandbar that links the Lithuanian port of Klaipeda to Kaliningrad , a closed and secretive oblast of the Russian Republic wedged between Lithuania and Poland . Even in this vacation hideaway conversation quickly turns , unsolicited , to politics . " I think about these problems every day ? every night , " a man from Vilnius tells me on the street . " People are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been in chains and handcuffs . Now the Russians are looking to us for success . They need Lithuanians to begin these things . But we are only a drop in the sea . " Lithuania looks prosperous . The earth is a dark chocolate , and farmhouses are smothered in flowers and fruit trees . Silos and haystacks , iron red cattle , and fields of clover rush by the windshield of our microbus . Buildings are better painted , brickwork tidier , shops a bit brighter than in Poland . In Klaipeda we marinate in a traffic jam worthy of Rome . Along a peaceful canal in the rebuilt city one evening I chat with two worm fishermen , Anatoli and his son , Kostya , age seven . " I grew up under Stalin , " says Anatoli , " but he turned out to be the enemy . Hah ! I 've seen lots of leaders come and go , but Gorbachev is the best yet . " Anatoli knows all about American politics too ; he quizzes me on Jesse Jackson . I ask if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suddenly less preposterous to him . " But I 'd have to save for three years , " he says , smiling . " Oh , I 'd go someday . " " If Mama lets you , " says Kostya wisely , biting into a green apple . The Baltic States are among the smallest of the Soviet republics , but the most urban and literate . From one state to another , culture changes sharply . Lithuanians are Roman Catholics with historic ties to the Poles . Latvians are Lutherans and speak a different IndoEuropean tongue . Estonians are Lutherans , linguistically among the Finno-Ugric stock , which includes Finns and Hungarians . For years the republics have shrewdly used environmental issues as safe but vital battlegrounds to resist the central control of Moscow . In Estonia dangerous and unwanted plans by central ministries to strip-mine more phosphate near the Baltic coast , to build an oil terminal near Tallinn , and to construct more shale-oil-burning electric power plants have been thwarted by popular resistance . In Latvia a grass-roots group called VAK has taken the initiative , leading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ construction of a subway under the capital city of Riga . " A subway would require the importation of workers from Russia , " says a young man from Riga . " And besides , Russian construction is so bad that we do n't trust them blasting and tunneling under the old city . " The closing , for at least five years , of Riga 's Jurmala Beach was a heavy blow . At the acerbic local newspaper , Jurmala , editor Aivars Baumanis is indignant : " We ca n't swim in the sea ? it 's the first summer . . . . It 's absurd ! " Jurmala is soiled mostly by the ancient Sloka pulp-and-paper plant , only 15 miles upstream , that spews its poisons into the Lielupe Df clover s .

Latvi ) nt Indo/ River and the Gulf of Riga , now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Our factories have been controlled by allunion ministries in Moscow , " says Baumanis . " Such ministers do n't care about the ecology of the republics . Five years ago we could n't say anything . It was taboo to discuss dirty water . It was top secret ! " Baumanis laughs heartily and lights another cigarette . " But now it 's changed . Now we talk openly about it . Glasnost ! Now they have the commitment . . . . The Sloka factory will be closed by March 31 . We can clean up our water . We have to overcome barriers ? lots of fools are still in the way . But we can do it . " BETWEEN LATVIA and Estonia we pick up a Russian woman and her daughter , hitchhiking to catch a Moscow train . They had been camping on a Latvian beach . " I 've had a lot of arguments with people here , " she tells us . " We Russians want to make all nationalities happy , but these Estonians and Latvians .... It 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motherland . It 's like Californians saying that their state is their only country . I do n't understand . " In Estonia there have been no burning tires and tear gas in the streets ; intellectual force and restraint have been the weapons of rebellion . And Moscow has given Estonians remarkably free rein . Hundreds of thousands , including new Communist Party leader Vaino Valjas , have gathered in Tallinn to sing fullthroated and righteous patriotic songs . Flagwaving demonstrators gather daily in Tallinn . Since last June , police have watched from a benign distance . On August 26 I join a protest to mark the anniversary of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact of 1939 , whose secret protocol divided Eastern Europe between Germany and the Soviet Union and led to the Soviet annexation of the Baltic States . At a rally in Hirve Park , Hitler @#  |p632  and Stalin are called " colleagues , " and Russians are rudely invited to " go loaf around in their own country . " The old Estonian Hymn is sung , haltingly but reverently . In a bizarre touch , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the harbor to the chant , " Russians go home ! Russians go home ! " Says Endel Lippmaa , a scientist and veteran of Kremlin corridor battles over the environment , " Gorbachev is using Estonia to demonstrate that he is a man of goodwill . In order to make perestroika credible , he must use some bait ? it suits global politics . I hope that he is sincere . But , at any rate , we must use this situation to put our house into better order . " Few feel the Baltic States can con their way into full independence . The Kremlin has already squelched hyperventilated calls for a separate Estonian currency , diplomatic corps , and membership in the United Nations and the Olympic committee . The Kremlin needs Estonia to perform ; it wants to see black ink , not rebellion , in return for the risk . But Estonians feel that economic success must be predicated on full autonomy . " Look at it this way , " says the erudite secretary of the Estonian Writers Union , Lennart Meri , " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Finland , not with the satellite countries like Poland . . . because FinnishSoviet trade is extensive and beneficial . This border could extend to the Baltic States . Ten years . . . give us ten years to begin to offer the same economic advantages to the Soviet Union as Finland does . It would work . " Estonia , with less than one percent of the Soviet population , already has more than half the nation 's joint-venture enterprises with the West . Private cooperatives such as coffee shops and grilled-meat stands have sprung up by the roadsides . A group of young wits from the resort town of Parnu sells cans of seawater as gag gifts ; on the labels they list the high pollution levels and give medical instructions . In Parnu the beach is closed , but the Neptun cooperative still runs its beachfront shop , renting surfboards and beach chairs . The crowds have been thin . " But it 's not just the pollution , " says the young manager . " The Russians are just as afraid of our blue-black-and-white as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other that Estonia is dangerous now ? like we were going to kill them or something ! " In other parts of the Soviet Union such raw enterprise is still controversial . Not so in Estonia . " We 've earned everything honestly , " says Andrus Sukles , one of the founders of Neptun . " The only trade-off has been our nerves , our stress . " But you know what I really like about today ? They tell us , If you 're a man , do it ! ' That 's what I like . " WE DRIVE ALONG the southwestern shore of Estonia in a storm . The beach is scrubbed by gray waves W hat foam through the reeds . The rain sweeps in , fresh from the west , as we stop at a campground where families from the village of Tiiri have come for their holidays . Above their tents flies an immense old @# @#  |p634  Estonian flag , resurrected from someone 's attic , where it had been hidden since 1940 . They embrace me like a lost son , offering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about their remarkable summer . " In our village we 're digging out the monument to the Estonian War of Freedom from under the asphalt , " says Theo Aasa , one of the leaders . " People remembered where it was buried by the Russians . This is a mass movement . It 's everywhere ! You ca n't stop it ! " His face brightens . " And no one is trying . " So far . So far . We take pictures of their beautiful old flag . " The old people are @#  |p635  weeping , " says Aasa . " This was unexpected in their lives . " We leave them gathered around the flagpole , these people from Tiiri , and walk back toward our microbus . Suddenly I hear applause behind us , warm and steady . They are clapping for us , for themselves , for the truth that electrifies the Baltic air , that men should be free . I try to wave good-bye from the window as we pull out , but my eyes well over , and I bury my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . My mother has always told me that the Baltic Sea is shaped rather like a woman kneeling in prayer ? her cowled head bowed between Finland and Sweden , her robe trailing off into Denmark and the Germanys , her knees pressing down on Poland . But her arms ? they are embracing Estonia . My journey ends with a full heart . Men of goodwill are about , and there is hope . The warships of seven nations still glare at one another . Pulp mills and chemical works still disgorge their poisons . But now we know that we all live on the same sea . Surely we can solve the ancient riddles that divide us . As the admiral said in the confused but expectant city of Leningrad , " Well . . . why not ? "
