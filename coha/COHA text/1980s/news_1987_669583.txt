The amount of legal surveillance is modest - and known . But no one knows how much illegal tapping of phones and eavesdropping in homes and businesses occurs in the United States . Experts suspect there is a great deal. // // A year and a half ago the congressional Office of Technology Assessment noted that only 392 illegal phone taps were reported to the Federal Bureau of Investigation during 1984 . But the OTA concluded that far more probably took place. // Rep. Robert Kastenmeier , Wisconsin Democrat and a ranking congressional expert on surveillance , says that ' ' we hear reports ' ' of widespread illegal wiretapping. // Recent technological advances make tapping , bugging , and other types of surveillance easier and harder to detect . Listening devices are smaller and cheaper . And computers raise the specter of widespread and sophisticated monitoring , both of businesses and individuals. // In recent years privacy experts have concentrated on bringing United States laws up to date , a step achieved last November in legislation guided by Representative Kastenmeier . ' ' Maybe it ' s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illegal tapping and eavesdropping on the agenda. // In the McFarlane case , a White House spokesman has denied that the device - designed to scramble conversations to protect privacy - which remained at the former NSC chief ' s home could have been used to eavesdrop . But electronic communications expert James Ross says the so-called scrambler could have been quickly and easily modified to pick up all phone conversations . The only way to tell whether a scrambler has been so modified is for an expert to examine it. // Mr. Ross is president of a private detective agency that specializes in countermeasures to surveillance . He has testified as an expert witness in several trials and is president of Communications Security Association , an international group of surveillance specialists. // Legal tapping of phone lines is done after a warrant has been approved by a state or federal court . Such surveillance is related either to criminal investigation or national security . In 1984 , 801 legal taps were placed in the US for criminal reasons , the highest number since 1973 , and approximately 600 for security @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ US law-enforcement and intelligence agencies conducted numerous illegal wiretaps . But no such illicit action by government agencies is apparent today . ' ' We just don ' t have any evidence ' ' of current illegal wiretapping by federal agencies , says Jerry Berman , legislative counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union ( ACLU ) . // The law that Kastenmeier shepherded to passage last fall made illegal many kinds of surveillance not covered by previous statute . But experts say that in the past thousands of illegal wiretaps and buggings were undertaken despite being forbidden by law , and without the perpetrators being caught . It ' s too early to tell whether the new measure will put a crimp in surveillance , says Gary Marx , a sociologist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , who has written extensively on surveillance . ' ' The issue , ' ' he adds , ' ' is implementation. ' ' // Traditionally , the largest number of illegal phone taps and surveillances were for divorce cases . Today two of the top reasons are organized crime and corporate espionage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into information stored in computers. // ' ' There is a pretty good likelihood , ' ' says Fred Wood , ' ' that illegal electronic activity by the criminal community is rampant . ' ' Mr. Wood was project director for the OTA ' s 1985 report on wiretaps. // Industrial espionage-by-computer is most likely in high-tech firms , he says . They are ' ' the ones best prepared to do electronic surveillance , and it ' s also where the incentives are greatest , because things change so fast. ' ' // Woods says companies that conduct computerized espionage are seeking ' ' advance information on product releases , strategic planning information. . . . ' ' // The microchip - the basic building block of computers - made this great leap in surveillance capability possible , says MIT ' s Professor Marx. // To Ross , the device that is ' ' probably the most serious threat of all ' ' to Americans ' privacy is a $25 transmitter , four inches square and one-quarter of one inch thick . Mass produced and for sale in many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything said in a room through electric power lines . ' ' It can be put into the wall , ' ' he says , ' ' into a clock ' ' into anything that plugs into an electric socket. // Other small items exist : a transmitter the size of a cigarette butt , a tape recorder , small enough to fit into a pocket. // But in their possible ramifications these items are dwarfed by the opportunities that today ' s computers offer for monitoring the unsuspecting. // ' ' There ' s the possibility , ' ' Ross says , ' ' that some of the modern computerized phone systems might be susceptible to being remotely reprogrammed ' ' to permit a third party to listen . ' ' I am quite certain that it ' s possible and is happening . You could reprogram a computer so that any time a certain extension dials a number , it is connected to ' ' someone listening in. // In a growing number of areas of the US phone companies have equipment called remobs , which is legally used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phone service . In normal mode it monitors a phone line for a minute or so and then switches to another . But ' ' in a practical sense the equipment can be modified , ' ' he says , to listen to only one number. // The National Security Agency , a supersecret arm of the federal government , is capable of monitoring huge numbers of phone calls made between the US and foreign nations . These calls go through the airwaves via microwave transmissions , and NSA devices can listen to many of them. // Sources differ as to whether the agency monitors all or a large percentage of these calls . In any case a portion of some calls are actually recorded , according to ACLU ' s Jerry Berman . The recording is automatically triggered when callers say several key words , indicating that what they ' re discussing might be of security interest to the US government. // And then there is the old-time , illegal phone tap on the individual . It still occurs , Ross and others say , in sizable but unknown numbers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there ' s no more idea today why each of these taps was made than there ever was. // //
