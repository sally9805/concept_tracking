Today , Mr. Havel stands center stage in Czechoslovakia ' s continuing political drama . He provided the inspiration for Civic Forum , the group that organized the recent demonstrations and strikes that toppled Czechoslovakia ' s hard-line communist regime . When hundreds of thousands of people demanding democracy massed in Wenceslas Square , he addressed them . When Communist officials talk about dialogue with the opposition , they mean first and foremost Havel. // // His voice rings out over the airwaves . His photos are pasted all over Prague . People wear stickers blaring , ' ' We love Havel. ' ' // In many ways , it is surprising that Havel plays such a key role . He is no charismatic , working-class leader or politician like Poland ' s Lech Walesa . He has little experience organizing factory strikes or street demonstrations. // Instead , he is a small , shy , soft-spoken man who considers himself only a simple playwright . His renown comes from his plays , absurdist dramas mocking his homeland ' s gray communism , and his essays , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an individual can have on totalitarianism. // ' ' I am a writer and human rights activist , ' ' he repeats over and over , ' ' not a politician. ' ' // Words and writers , however , play a much more important role in Eastern Europe than in the West . Because normal political activity long was suppressed by an overweening state , it was left to the artist to voice the longings of the nation. // During the 19th century , when Czechoslovakia was submerged within the larger Austro-Hungarian Empire , writers led the Czech nationalist revival , concentrating on reviving national culture rather than on organizing a nationalist political party . Havel himself is often compared to Karel Havilcek-Borovsky , the great 19th-century nationalist writer who - like Havel - was banned. // ' ' The Great Havel , ' ' says Jiri Dienstbier , his friend and fellow founder of Civic Forum . ' ' He has become larger than life , almost a myth. ' ' // His life itself followed a strange , quirky path . He entered the theater game by chance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writing for fun . After his first play was produced ( ' ' The Garden Party ' ' is a powerful story of a student whose consuming interest is playing chess ) , he became artistic director of Prague ' s most important avant-garde theater , the Ballustrade. // When a wave of freedom spread over Czechoslovakia during the so-called Prague Spring , Havel ' s plays led the way . After the August 1968 Soviet-led invasion , the then-32-year-old playwright condemned it in a courageous , clandestine shortwave broadcast . During the grim ' ' normalization ' ' process that cut off the most prominent Prague Spring participants from their jobs and futures , Havel ' s books were removed from all libraries and his plays were banned. // In 1977 , he helped draft Charter 77 ' s ' ' Declaration ' ' of Human Rights . Within 24 hours , he and four other organizers were arrested and their homes ransacked. // In Havel ' s view , moral courage is the necessary ingredient to bring about a more democratic society . Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev helps speed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - from , as Havel puts it , people ' ' living in truth. ' ' // To get across his point , he tells the story of a manager of a fruit and vegetable shop who places in his window , among the onions and carrots , the slogan ' ' workers of the world , unite . ' ' Nobody believes in the slogan . But if the manager refused to display it he would be demoted , he would lose the chance of spending his holidays in Black Sea resorts , and his children would not be able to go to university . Out of fear , he continues to wave the slogan . For positive change to come , Havel reasons that the owner must take down the false sign. // This passage , from the essay ' ' The Power of the Powerless , ' ' has become the rallying cry of Czechoslovakia ' s nonviolent ' ' revolution . ' ' Over the past few evenings , actors and writers have taken to reading it aloud in theaters across the country . Crowds react in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passage , which describes just what has happened here , ' ' says Milos Calda , a philosophy professor . ' ' People have finally stood up and said : ' We lived a lie. ' ' ' // Throughout the demonstrations , Czechs chanted , shouted , honked their horns , shook their keys . But they never lost sight of Havel ' s warning against violence and lies . These , Havel told them , are the methods of his oppressors. // The best path forward , he says , is dialogue with Czechoslovakia ' s crumbling Communist Party . After 20 years of refusing , that dialogue has begun , with Havel playing the leading role . He has been meeting with the new prime minister , Marian Calfa , to discuss the formation of the new government. // Appearing before 15 , 000 cheering youngsters at a recent rock concert , he looked tired and uncomfortable . On stage , he fidgeted in his seat . Although no one doubts his moral integrity , some observers here fear that Havel may not turn out to be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Solidarity leaders like ( Bronislaw ) Geremek are like acupuncturists ; they know exactly what points to prick , ' ' says British analyst Timothy Garton-Ash . ' ' Havel and his friends in the Czechoslovak Civic Forum may not have the same political skills. ' ' // Havel long repeated that he desires no position for himself . But circumstances and his own conscience have catapulted him into the political arena. // ' ' Havel insists he is not a politician , that he is first of all a playwright , ' ' says Civic Forum activist Petr Friedenberger . ' ' Yet he is the only person capable of taking this country out of the mess . Our people trust him . So even if he himself doesn ' t like it , he has no choice except to take a job. ' ' // As a result of this popular pressure , Havel has agreed that if asked he would accept the presidency for a short time . The president enjoys little control over day-to-day governing . Instead , the post is designed for moral leadership. // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Havel the nonperson ' as president , ' ' says Karel Dyba , an official at the Economic Forecasting Institute . ' ' But it may be the only solution . He is the only individual who enjoys sufficient public confidence. ' ' // //
