txt F A FORMER NASA scientist has ' Ms way , a lot of the romance is going to go out of apace exploration . On the other hand , those of us who would balk at sitting on top of a huge rocket will have a safe  --  If mundane  --  alternative method of making our first trip toward the stars . The scientist 's name is Jerome Pearson , ana ma Invention Is an elevator from the Earth into apace . It would be Just like the elevator you ride to your office in the'morning , except it would take you 72,000 miles up and into orbit . " We are Just in the research stages now , " Pearson said . " But there are a couple of definite ways to do It , and I think It 's only a matter of time . " Pearson , 43 , Is an aerospace engineer at the Air Force Flight Dynamics Laboratory ; near Dayton , Ohio . During the Apollo program he was a civilian engineer for . NASA ; In fact , he applied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his eyes were bhd . ' ' " They Just wanted jet pilot types , " Pearson said . " I knew I never had a chance , but I had to give it a try . " 110 -- IF NASA would n't let him ride a rocket Into ? space  --  he decided to direct his energies at other ways of getting there . He devised a theory of building a giant cable from space orbit back to a ground station on Earth , and then sending an electrically powered elevator , carrying humans , up the cable . Unbeknownst to Pearson , a Soviet scientist named Yuri N. Artautanov was working on a similar project , but became stymied because there was not a material readily available to build a strong enough cable . " And that 's still the major problem , " Pearson said . " The project Is perfectly feasible , but we still have to develop a cable that is light enough , and at the same time strong enough , to let an elevator climb into space . " He believes the perfection of such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ material known as graphite whiskers la being developed , and when it is ready , the space elevator can be built . " The process Is not that difficult , " Pearson said . " The first thing we 'd do is send a space shuttle into orbit with big drums of cable on board . Then we 'd drop the first strand back to the Earth . When it got there , we 'd start sending more and more strands up the first strand , on self-propelled climbers . With each new strand , the cable would be le-enforced . It would be like building a suspension bridge . " WHEN THE.CABLE was strong enough , he said , the elevator car would be attached to it . And then it would just be a matter of climbing aboard , pushing a button , and riding smoothly up the cable to one 's destination in ' apace . " It would be tremendously economical , " Pearson said . " You would n't have to deal anymore with rockeie. that cost millions of dollars.iiiid needed umpteen tow of thrust to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " ' At the - top end of the cable would be a satellite positioned so that its orbit would keep precise pace with the elevator 's ground station . Thus , even thoughThe satellite was constantly orbiting , its orbit would mirror the Earth 's own turning on its axis , and would not float away from the ground station . " The practical application would be to lift an untold ? amount of tonnage into space at a ridiculously low ? cost , " Pearson said . " This would be wonderful for industry . " More importantly , though , he said , the elevator would allow thousands of people to go into space who would never think of riding a rocket from Cape Canaveral . " I CAN ENVISION a two-week vacation In space for $1,000 or less , " he said . " A hotel could be built up there in orbit to cater to the travelers . Once people started talking about that fantastic view of Earth that you could n't get anywhere else , I imagine it would be quite a popular spot , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ride the space shuttle into space for a vacation . Because you 've still got to sit on top of that very dangerous rocket to get up there  --  and there 's a limit to how many people the shuttle could carry , even if people were willing to ride it . The idea of riding an elevator into space in a safe way might be very appealing . " He said he realizes that the idea of a safe space elevator might be a letdown to those Americans who grew up In the John Glenn-Alan Shepard days of fearful space drama  --  but " by the time we reach the stage of the elevator into space , I 'm sure there will be even more dangerous things for the more Intrepid explore= to do . There 's always room for danger and excitement  --  but there should also be room for the average person In space . " THE WAY PEARSON envisions ft , the elevator car would hold 20 to 30 people . They would be strapped Into seats much like the ones on a commercial airliner . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and except for the first few minutes of liftoff would be as comfortable as a regular elevator ride . Already Science Digest magazine has commented favorably on Pearson 's project , and he is convinced that it Is only a matter of time until Americans are routinely riding the space elevator . " There was a time when I thOught my project would never have a chance , " Pearson said . " People seemed to have lost Interest in space exploration , and there were no funds for Ideas like this . " But now people are Interested in space again , and there 's a feeling that anything is possible . There are to many practical uses for a space elevator that it seems like a natural thing to follow up on . " He admits that the idea first came to him as a fanciful urge based on his own rejection by NASA as an astronaut candidate . If they would n't let him go Into ' space their way , then he 'd do it his way . " But every idea starts out as a fanciful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no fanciful dreams , no one , would ever accomplish anything . " ?
