A shawl slung over his shoulder and a turban on his head , the Prime Minister stumps the countryside lauding an age-old system of rural local government whose revitalization is the centerpiece of his re-election campaign this year. // Mr. Gandhi is talking about the elected village panchayat . The institution , whose name is drawn from the Sanskrit for " council of five wise men , " has been a part of Indian life for centuries . A panchayat , with any number of members , served as a kind of town council In modern times , however , the system has functioned effectively in only a few places where it could escape domination by powerful politicians , feudal landlords or high-caste communities not inclined to foster democracy and decision-making at the grass roots. // // Amendment Is Introduced // Prime Minister Gandhi , promising voters a decentralization of power , wants to make elected village councils compulsory all over India , and has introduced a constitutional amendment to bring about " panchayati raj , " or " power to the panchayats . " The slogan is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also wants to link the financing of the panchayat system to the central Government , a provision that opponents of his amendment say will greatly reduce the powers of state government in local development. // Here in Budigere , as in hundreds of villages in the southern Indian state of Karnataka , panchayati raj is thriving , said Nanjappa , a farmer who is president of his local council. // Mr. Nanjappa showed a visitor what his panchayat , elected from several hamlets - and with seats set aside for women and the most under-privileged castes - has accomplished in less than three years. // Budigere has a new milk cooperative and silkworm farm that benefit the whole community . Individual residents of the town have been given small loans to set up , for example , a shoe repair shop or a booth where clothes are ironed by a woman in need of an income . <> <> ' Progress Was Fast ' // " There are 56 , 000 people all over Karnataka elected to panchayats , " said C. Narayanaswamy , president of the Distict Assembly for rural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mr. Narayanaswamy , a country lawyer who now has the rank and salary of a state minister , coordinates with state and federal administrators in allocating money and resources as local councils think they should be distributed. // Karnataka has , in effect , given village people the right to map their own development , rather than accept whatever package the federal or state government might hand down. // " When panchayats came in , almost all the districts gave priority to education and rural water supplies , " Mr. Narayanaswamy said . " Progress was fast . " Within two years , every village had a school . Epidemic gastric diseases were cut down . Tube wells are now used for drinking water instead of adulterated open wells or ponds. " // " This is a direct democracy in which all people participate , " he said . He added that in the Karnataka system , which he fears could be weakened by Mr. Gandhi ' s version of a panchayat law , village assemblies made up of all adult residents complement the elected panchayats , serving as watchdogs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and responsibilities , it has also made them aware of the accountability of officials , " Mr. Narayanaswamy said . " They are not afraid of politicians. " // Ramakrishna Hegde , the former Chief Minister of Karnataka and the architect of its panchayat system , said , " It is the village community that must decide on how to carry on their local work. " // Mr. Hegde is now a leader of India ' s opposition Janata Dal Party , which Mr. Gandhi dismissed from power in Karnataka in April . He had to wait a year and a half for the central Government under Mr. Gandhi to approve Karnataka ' s panchayat law in 1983-84 and is bitter about the Prime Minister ' s sudden decision to champion the concept now that its popularity has been proved. // M. A. S. Rajan , a retired Indian administrative officer who watched Karnataka develop over the last half century , said Mr. Gandhi ' s proposed system was " ersatz " compared with Mr. Hegde ' s bold dispersal of powers , which puts politicians under constant surveillance. // But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ administrative staff college , added that Karnataka was not a typical Indian state. // " Karnatake has a good civil service , " he said . " The state was able to accomplish a radical land reform program quickly . We set the pattern . In other states , land reform was subverted with guns . In Bihar , people rode in on elephants and shot the new landowners. " // " So when we came to panchayats , the people were ready , " he said . " It requires a certain sophistication to do these things . " <> <> ' A Half-Baked Scheme ' // L. C. Jain , an expert on local government in India and abroad , said , " Karnataka tried to find an answer to a knotty problem : how to get the bureaucracy to give up space. " // Mr. Jain has written on the concepts of Mohandas K. Gandhi , the leader of Indian ' s independence movement and no relation to the present Prime Minister , who promoted panchayats as he also promoted local economic self-sufficiency . He thought a country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ model for a huge country with diverse religious ethnic and linguistic groups. // Mr. Jain called Prime Minister Gandhi ' s proposed 64th Amendment " a half-baked scheme " that did not look at the fundamental changes in economic and political policies that would have to be made in order to introduce a genuine panchayat system on Mahatma Gandhi ' s model. // " If this were serious , not just election slogan-raising , " he said , " all parties would have been called together to discuss participation. " // " The Prime Minister is saying that he is fulfilling Gandhi ' s dream , " Mr. Jain said . " That is like saying Gandhi kept a goat , so all people keeping goats are Gandhians.
