" We are being jammed . . . We are being jammed . . . When you hear the Czech national anthem you will know it 's all over . " <P>  --  Radio Prague , August 1968 <P> The last surge of reformist fervor in Czechoslovakia ended abruptly the night of Aug. 20 , 1968 , when some 500,000 soldiers from five Warsaw Pact nations flooded across the borders . As the invading armies advanced on Prague , elite paramilitary units of the KGB landed at the capital 's Ruzyne Airport , then fanned out and secured key transportation and communication centers . Czechoslovak citizens awoke to find the streets of all major cities blocked by tanks . <P> When the invasion began , the leaders of Alexander Dubcek 's government were meeting to consider further liberalization and the ouster of some hard-liners from the ruling Presidium . " How could they do this to me ? " Dubcek reportedly exclaimed . " I have served the cause of the Soviet Union and Communism all my life . " All the reformers were quickly arrested , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brezhnev . TASS offered the lamest of rationales . " Party and government leaders , " the Soviet news agency claimed , " have asked the Soviet Union and other allied states to render the fraternal Czechoslovak people urgent assistance " against counterrevolutionary forces . Moscow 's assertion of the right to use force to prevent departures from Communist orthodoxy in satellite nations came to be known as the Brezhnev Doctrine . <P> The Czechoslovaks resisted as best they could . Mobs of youths surrounded the tanks and tried to persuade the young soldiers manning them to pull out . When persuasion failed , the Czechoslovaks began throwing garbage , rocks , bottles and , finally , fire bombs . A battle was fought around the offices of Radio Prague , where tanks and troops had to push through a barricade of buses and a hail of Molotov cocktails before taking over the station . In all , nearly 100 people were killed as the Warsaw Pact forces consolidated their putsch . <P> In the face of overwhelming military power , the will to resist soon waned , but dissidents continued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invasion . " We have no weapons , " said one renegade transmission , " but our contempt is stronger than tanks . "
