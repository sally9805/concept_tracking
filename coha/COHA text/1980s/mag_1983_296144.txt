Was it afire sale ? <P> <P> Bumptious Interior Secretary James Watt found himself at the center of a new embroilment last week . The cause of the row : Watt 's alleged mismanagement of the Federal Government 's coal-leasing program , which , according to a House Appropriations Committee report , permitted the energy industry to buy coal-leasing rights at " fire sale " prices and reap " windfall profits " at taxpayers ' expense . <P> The 121-page study , issued after an eight-month investigation , focuses on the April 28 , 1982 , auction of leases to 13 tracts in the prized Powder River Basin area . Interior officials say the sale , involving more than 21,000 acres " and 1.6 billion tons of coal , was the largest in the nation 's history . <P> The Powder River deal netted taxpayers $66 million , plus promises of hundreds of millions of dollars more in future royalties . But the House report charges the base price is $60 million less than the committee investigators feel the properties are worth . Moreover , says the report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the market by flooding it with leased coal . " In sometimes acrimonious testimony before the committee 's Interior Subcommittee , Garrey Carruthers , Assistant Secretary for Land and Water Resources , maintained that the sale brought the Government $11 million more than the department 's original $55 million estimate . The congressional report is " a poorly prepared and deceitful political document , " he fumed . " We do not give coal away . " <P> In fact , fair market value , the crux of the issue , is virtually impossible to calculate . The Government , which owns an estimated 34% of the nation 's 475-billion-ton coal reserve , has routinely leased public land for coal extraction since 1920 . In 1971 , in order to evaluate its procedures , the Government declared a moratorium on federal coal leases . The hiatus , which did not end until 1981 , effectively froze the market for coal leases , making future evaluations of tracts difficult . A 1976 reform requiring new leaseholders to mine their fields within ten years or forfeit their rights further complicated the mathematics of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Powder River Basin auction , the committee report said , experts in the regional office of Interior 's Minerals Management Service ( MMS ) in Casper , Wyo. , spent 4,000 man-hours trying to determine the fair market " value " for each tract . But , feeling that the figures were not reliable , department officials in Washington rejected them . Barely one month before the sale , Interior came up with its own " entry level " bids , some of which were as much as half the MMS recommendation . The new prices , said an MMS official who worked on the original set of figures , " were far too low , way out of line . " Around the same time , regional Minerals Manager Dwayne Hull notified his superiors that the higher MMS prices had been mysteriously leaked to industry representatives . Carruthers last week refuted the charge that this disclosure tainted the sale because the MMS prices had been scrapped anyway .
