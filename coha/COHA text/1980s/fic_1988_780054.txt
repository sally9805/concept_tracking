 | I jerked around on the bench , looking up . I could just see Elnear standing on the balcony of her study , staring straight down at us . " Would you come inside please ? " I pushed to my feet , the spell broken that had stopped time , stopped thought inside me . I left Lazuli there , backing away until I could make myself turn and walk looking ahead toward the house . I went up the steps , through the door , into the cool shadowy hall , blinking as I followed it to Elnear 's study . My mind was still lost somewhere back along the path from the garden . I did n't know what Elnear was going to say to me ; worse , I did n't know how I was going to answer it . " Ma'am ? " I said at last , my voice hoarse , as I stopped in her doorway . Elnear turned away from the windows . She came toward me , silhouetted by the light . At first I could n't make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't know what you think you are doing here , " she said , not even bothering with the usual polite pretensions . " But you are not here to insinuate yourself into the private lives of this family . I will not have you using your  --  telepathy , " she said it like an obscenity , " to take advantage of children , or of a troubled woman who does n't know what she wants . " I felt my face burning . " I was n't ? " I broke off , realizing that it was no use . That true or not , nothing I could say would make any difference to her . And that was the worst part of all . " I do n't understand it , " I said , finally . " What do n't you understand ? " She kept the length of a long tabletop inlaid with stars between us , and a wall of anger contempt fear . " Why Jule thought you loved her . She asked me to help you because she said you were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the real reason I came here  --  because she asked me to . You must have hated her just as much as everyone else did . " Her mouth worked ; she wanted to blame me for the pain that was suddenly there inside her , but she could n't . She turned away , looking at something across the room . Her husband 's picture . She said , her voice almost inaudible , " Jule was so helpless . . . so lost . . . she needed someone so much , someone who would love her unconditionally .... " She looked back at me , and suddenly in her mind there was the unwanted image of how I 'd looked that first day , as she 'd left me standing there alone in the sunroom . " Jule was different . " I turned , moving too fast because I wanted to get away from her  | so much . My shirt caught on the outstretched arm of a sculpture standing by the doorway . I heard cloth rip as it jerked me up short ; the loose-knotted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dropped to the carpet . I leaned down , grabbed it up , swearing . It was torn right across the front . " Cat . " Elnear 's voice caught at me like the sculpture 's arm . I straightened up , the shirt wadded between my fists , facing away from her . " How . . . who did that to your back ? " " Nobody . " I took a step . " Cat . " " Ask Isplanasky . " I turned to face her again . " I got out of Contract Labor with my skin intact , right ? So there 's nothing wrong with my back . " I threw my ruined shirt over my shoulders , tied it in a knot again , covering my scars . " That happened to you while you worked for Contract Labor ? " Not really a question . " I have heard that some of the combines treat their laborers badly , " she said , awkwardly . " The FTA tries to maintain ? " " The FTA did this to me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prod laid a line of liquid fire across my naked back , and another , and another . " At the Federation Mines , out in the Crab Colonies . . . If it had n't been for Jule paying off my contract , I would n't be standing here right now . Forty-five percent of the bondies there do n't live long enough to last out their time . But you probably never access that kind of information . " She looked at me for what seemed like hours , bracing herself by her hand on the back of a chair . . . looked at me and thought about my words , and looked , and thought . . . like someone looking at a square with five sides . At last she said , " I understand now why you said what you did yesterday . But I do n't understand how it could happen . Natan would never allow ? " " You said it yourself . Humans do n't run the FTA ; it runs itself . Isplanasky does n't run the Federation Mines  --  he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do . " She 'd said it , but she had n't heard what she was saying . " But the whole reason the FTA exists is to protect the welfare of . . . of the dispossessed , " she said . " Not to create more suffering . Why should it exploit with one hand as it stops exploitation with the other ? " There was no echo of recognition in her mind ; she was so deep inside her own vision of her work that she could n't see anything else .  | " Do you eat meat ? " I said . She looked at me blankly . " Yes , I do . " " But you consider yourself a moral person , right ? You love animals , you have them for pets , you 'd never kick a dog in the street . How do you justify eating meat ? " " I . . . " Her face reddened . " I have to eat to survive . " " Jule never eats meat . " She looked away , her fingers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us was more surprised by this conversation . " Okay , " I said , " so maybe the FTA even considers itself a moral being . You called it a Humane Society for humans . But it 's got to eat . And eating meat is easier . " One hand rose to her head , ruffling her hair . " Your point , Cat , " she murmured , finally . " A point well taken . I will speak with Natan about it , when I get the chance . " " You really think that 'll make any difference ? " She frowned slightly ; the frown faded . " Individuals have been known to change their minds . Even on such a scale . But they need input , information . Just as you said . " " Is that why you 're doing this debate ? " I 'd wondered why she bothered , if she did n't think that what individual humans wanted or believed made any difference any more . Maybe it explained why she wanted to be on the Security Council too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power , or to escape from the taMings . " You really think there are some ways you can still matter ? " " I suppose I do . " She nodded , but she was n't sure of anything now , not even of why she really wanted that Council slot . She moved back toward the windows , the bright heat of anger gone out of her , her movements slow and almost aimless . She wanted me to go away . It was what I wanted , too , but somehow I could n't . I could n't let go of that invisible line between us that neither of us knew how to snap . She stared down at the gardens , outlined by the light . Lazuli was gone ; gone from sight , but not from her thoughts . " How is Jule ? " she asked at last . " What is her life like now , with Dr. Siebeling ? Is she finally , truly happy ? " " As happy as anybody ever is , I guess . " I crossed the room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not too close . " She and Siebeling have a little place upside in Quarro . She 's got it full of stray animals ... she ca n't leave anything alone that needs help . Doc just steps over them , and smiles . " I 'd been her first stray . After he 'd learned to live with me , he had n't minded the rest . " Siebeling 's good for her .  | She 's good for him . They have a place in Oldcity were they help other psions to pull their lives back together , like they did for themselves ... and for me . " " I 'm so glad . " She was . I felt her thoughts begin to find a center , an anchor , in the image of Jule smiling , helping others to smile . Maybe there was still hope after all , even for herself .... She glanced back at me , her eyes questioning . " Have you ever been to Quarro , ma'am ? " Asking it before she could ask a question nobody really wanted answered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep a house in Quarro . " " You ever go to the Hanging Gardens there ? " It gave me a chance to look away from her , out at these gardens again . When I 'd first seen the Hanging Gardens , when I was sixteen or seventeen , I could n't believe that what I saw was natural , barely even believed it was real . I remembered the colors had been too bright , the forms too incredible , the rich sweet perfume of the flowers too intense . The Gardens rimmed the access well that was the only way in or out of Oldcity . They 'd been right over my head all my life , always just out of reach . " It 's a beautiful place , " Elnear said . " Some of the most exquisite gardens I 've ever seen . " " It 's beautiful here , too . Sometimes it reminds me of . . . of Quarro . " I could n't quite make myself say " home . " " Does it ? " She looked surprised , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guess you have to be a stranger to a place to really see its beauty . " " Did you ever look over the edge when you were there at the Gardens ? " " Over the edge ? " she asked , trying to imagine what I was talking about . " Into the Tank . Into Oldcity . " She shook her head . " No . " " You have to live in a place to really know its ugliness . " " Yes . " Suddenly she was n't seeing the gardens any more . Sorrow settled over her , graying her mind , sloping her shoulders , until I was sorry I 'd said it . " I must get back to my work . " She meant getting ready to face Stryger in the debate , to defend her belief in the FTA 's incorruptibility ( she glanced at me as she turned away from the window ) , to take another step toward a slot on the Security Council , and away from here , the taMings , Centauri  --  this trap that her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... " " Ma'am ? " I said . She turned back . " I hate Centauri nearly as  | much as you do . I .. . " as she looked at me , " I just wanted you to know that . Braedee wo n't hear anything from me again that you do n't clear first . " Suddenly she was remembering what I 'd said about the real reason why I 'd come here to work for her ; suddenly she was really hearing it . She looked down , moving random objects randomly on her desk : a statue of a child , a glass ball with a fragile puffball flower suspended impossibly inside it . . . . For just a second I stared at it , because the ball looked so much like something I 'd had once : a Hydran thing , full of hidden secrets , that had felt warm and almost alive when I held it in my hands . . . . But that was gone ; this was only a cold ball made of glass , with an image inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked up again , and caught me still staring . I turned away from the look in her eyes and went out of the room without saying anything more . SOME DWEEB ONCE said to me , " Cheer up . Things could always be worse . " He was right about that much . The face debate on drug deregulation was set for late afternoon the next day . I got to the place where it was going to happen about midday , before Elnear and Jardan , working with Braedee 's Security crew this time . I 'd had to argue Braedee into letting me come . I was n't sure whether it was the news that Daric knew about me , or the trouble I 'd caused in Isplanasky 's office , or just his own fear of psions that made him try to tell me that before Elnear got there I did n't matter .  | He finally gave in , the way someone would stop chasing a fly because it was n't important enough to waste time on . The floating Independent News studio had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of N'Yuk . It was a thick-walled building made of gray stone that had been a godshouse before the Recreation . Since the Indy could n't count on an interplanetary freighter to crash-land during the debate , they 'd wanted to give the viewers something to look at besides heads if their attention wandered . When I walked in , it was like walking into a kaleidoscope . The tall , arching windows along the side walls were made of thousands of bits of colored glass fused together , pictures of paradise painted from fragments of pure light . The Indy production crew had backlit them all for perfect effect , and rainbows of color bled into the stagnant air above the stage . It had been Stryger 's idea to have this debate ; but the Indy News had made it a reality . They 'd even gotten an exclusive lock on it . They were plugging a lot of other vips into the same circuits with Stryger , so that curious citizens all over the Federation could get close to them in a way they did n't get to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not sending hidden messages through channels that only they could access . With all the publicity support Stryger had gotten , the ratings for this event would probably be astronomical . Everybody involved with it hoped they would be . The thousands of channels that wove the Net 's million separate corporate systems into something like a coherent whole were mostly there to keep their citizens amused ; but they were also a way that combines too paranoid to communicate directly could send out messages under a white flag to each other , and to the rest of the galaxy . Shander Mandragora was moderating the debate . Mandragora was the Indy ' s most popular fax hyper ; even I knew who he was . He covered anything important the Federation Assembly did , and what they did was always important to somebody . Other hypers , from more combine networks than anybody knew existed , had been crawling all over the floating studio where the debate was set since before dawn that morning . Most of them were bitching about the Indy 's calculated generosity in letting them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The media techs were easy to spot  --  their attitude was if you got it , flaunt it . They wore their cyber equipment openly as they swaggered past ; third eyes and hand-cameras , all their senses wired to record . Like street gangs , they liked the idea of standing out from the crowd . It gave them a special power , like psi . . . but it was one the combines  | wanted and needed , so it made them different , but it did n't make them freaks . I felt a kind of jealousy as I watched them , the easy arrogance their portable territory gave them . After a while the debaters themselves finally began to arrive . Besides Stryger and Elnear , the main draws in this particular infotainment , there was Isplanasky repping the FTA , three Assembly members fronting various combine blocs , and a couple of Corporate Security Chiefs . Stryger came in first with his band of ass-kissing disciples , carrying his walking stick in his hand . Sojourner meant seeker . He always carried the staff , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wash of colored light from the windows only made him look more beautiful . There was no doubt in his mind that he was going to make this day his . He was in his element ; I wondered if somehow he 'd had something to do with them choosing this place for the debate . He spotted me in the crowd , almost as if he could feel me staring at him , feel my hatred , or my fascination . . . . He saw me , and suddenly his confidence screamed , rattling through my skull . I stood there watching while he stopped his forward momentum , lifting his staff to stop the momentum of everyone around him as he Illl saw me . They swirled to a halt in a kind of confused slow motion while he looked into my eyes and thought , ( I know you 're listening .... ) The words were fuzzy and shapeless , formed by a mind without any sensitivity to the Gift , but clear enough . He raised his Ill staff to me in a kind of benediction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that only we two shared . ( Bless you , boy , you are the answer to all my prayers . ) He smiled , a smile so sweet it should have been a lover 's , a smile that leered at me like a slashed throat . I wanted to use my psi on him , to find out what he meant by that  --  to see his smug face crack , to feel his loathing , disgust , raw hatred  --  anything but what I felt inside him now . But his confidence was real , and it turned my concentration to random noise . At last he looked away from me and went on , setting me free to slink off like a coward and lose myself in the crowd of techs . Elnear came in with Jardan a few minutes later , and the media imageshapers crawled all over her like bugs , like they 'd done with the rest . Only Stryger had his own personal image crew . I sat in a corner close by Elnear , trying to make myself invisible while I kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She was wearing a bodyguard , like all the speakers , but I did my job anyway . Now and then 11 Jardan sent me to fetch something or someone , her voice like a barbed whip ; waiting for me to do something half-assed again . Isplanasky  | stopped by for some kind of last minute exchange , and glanced at me like he expected me to explode . But as he passed me on his way out he said , " 1 want to see you later . " At least it did n't sound like a threat . Finally every piece was pushed into place . I settled onto one of the hard historical benches beside Jardan , herded together by Security with all the other aides and hangers-on and hypers . Up on the stage the speakers seemed to float above the curving band of light that was their mutual podium , flowing into the sea of light behind them . I wondered how anyone would be able to concentrate on anything but that light . The words had better be good . They were good . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the talking heads that gave human faces to the beliefs and policies of faceless economic networks . These people had been chosen because they knew how to come across well  --  and because , whatever they were saying about the deregulation of pentryptine , that it was a disaster or a blessing or did n't really matter in the Great Motion of Time , they believed it . They were all augmented , and they were plugged into Mandragora , letting him monitor their sincerity electronically . The viewers could readout for themselves exactly how much to trust what they saw and heard . Even Isplanasky came across clean and sincere in everything he said . But in the end it all came down to Elnear and Stryger , the unspoken rivalry between them , the opening on the Security Council that they both wanted . Nobody was saying anything about it , not yet anyway , but everyone knew : all the hypers waiting with their questions and their prefab points of view , the Federation Assembly members , the Security Council itself . They 'd all be weighing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ audience . . . the leverage they could get on the Assembly , which would prove their strength when the votes on deregulation were counted . Deregulation was still being data-modeled by an Assembly special committee . But Elnear  --  and everyone else  --  knew that the committee would approve it in the next few days . And the way things stood the measure was almost as sure to pass on the Assembly floor . Isplanasky finished his speech and Mandragora gave the audience to Elnear at last . She looked out over the crowd , her eyes searching their faces as if she was looking for someone ; but there was too much light . She looked at Mandragora again . " I had a very unusual conversation yesterday , " she said . " With someone who asked me why I was participating in this debate , when I had told him that I thought  | individual human beings no longer had control of the Federation 's fate , that our lives were ruled by the whims of interstellar commerce .... " I leaned forward in sudden surprise . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told him that I would be here today because I believed that even something on the scale of the Federation Assembly or a multiworld combine could still be influenced , if the evidence had enough weight , enough public opinion behind it pushing . I know that there are enough individual citizens inputting us here to influence the courses chosen by even such gigantic systems . You have the access right in your hands to register your opinion on the open Net . I want you to do that , whatever your decision is , so that you can see the power you still have , if you choose to use it . " Because yesterday this person asked me some other questions , hard questions about the things I believed in . The Federation he knows is a very different place from the one I know . It made me realize how easy it is to dismiss a problem that does n't seem to touch you directly  --  how deceptive , how dangerous . He also said to me that you have to know a place to really see its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the biochem business . " I listened as she went on speaking , telling them her vision of what letting these chemicals loose could do to the individual human identities of the billions of people receiving her , and how easily it could be done . Telling everyone that she was on the board of a drug combine that held the major patents on those drugs . That it would make profits off of them that would bloat ChemEnGen ( and Centauri , although she did n't mention it by name ) . Telling the Federation that she still could n't accept the promises that had been made about safety , because she knew too well how much promises were worth . . . . The words were n't that different from the ones Isplanasky had spoken ; but there was a heat behind them that seared them into your brain . As if this was n't just a matter of ideology , but something she felt as responsible for as her own life . As if those invisible billions were her own family , her children .... Jardan sat silently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shining with pride and reflected light . All the speakers had been good , but Elnear was genuine , original  --  the best . But she was n't the last . I looked at Stryger as Mandragora introduced him , and all the eyes in the room , real or recording , began to focus on him . He was the only one who seemed to belong here . His face was as translucent and glowing as the air , radiating the intensity  | of ' his own belief , in himself , in the divine power he thought was speaking through him . If this place had n't been chosen just to suit him , it might as well have been . He began to speak : strong but easy words , nothing about God or damnation ; letting the listeners know he was n't a fanatic , or a combine vip , but just a concerned Everybody . I tried not to listen to what he was saying or to look at him , and yet my glance kept falling out of the air , away from the windows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't help hating him ; and partly because , like the last time , I just could n't look away . Maybe absolute confidence gave you that kind of gravitational pull , or maybe it was just the fanatic 's intensity he 'd been born with . But I kept watching , kept listening , as his speech slowly sucked a billion minds into the " dark underside of life " that he claimed to understand , like he really knew anything about it . . . . About killing to stay alive , about stealing to keep from starving , about making ten credits the hard way , and using it to buy enough drugs to help you forget what you 'd just done to earn it . . . . Talking about how his drugs could " let the light " into the minds and lives of all those deeves and pervs and psions ( and there was no change in his voice , as if he did n't really hate psions any more than murderers or rapists ) ? those troublemakers who still kept crawling out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a perfect machine , when we had the means within our grasp to change all that forever  --  His voice was ringing now , his eyes were smoking , but I could feel him still in perfect control of the rising spiral . And there was nothing at all on the readout below him , nothing that would prove to anyone watching whether he meant every word of it or not . He was n't cybered , Isplanasky had said . He had no way to tie into the Indy 's system . But somehow , instead of making him seem like he had something to hide , it only made him seem to be above all that , so goddamn pure that he did n't need to prove his sincerity to anyone . " . . . Lady Elnear is concerned that deregulating the production of these drugs might lead to their misuse .... " I looked up again , as I heard him mention Elnear . " . . . But I believe that it would be taking them out of the hands of those people who already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now produce and illegally sell tiny quantities of these drugs for astronomical prices on the Lack Market . To defend the laws that force these drugs into the hands of those very criminals who are now the only ones who profit from them financially is hardly in anyone 's best  | interest . They are the ones who could profit the most morally if the drugs were used as they were meant to be used . " To suggest , as Lady Elnear has , that using these drugs for the purpose God intended is evil can only be called misguided . To say that the combine networks that provide for all our needs are worse than the criminals that exploit us is irresponsible . I have always believed that Lady Elnear was sincere in her unflinching crusade to create a more humane society " But now I must question you , Lady . " He turned to face her , violating the structure of the debate , which was supposed to leave Mandragora in charge of asking the questions . " Are you not in fact protecting the deviants in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as much as I do ? " Elnear looked at him , startled , caught off-guard . " Of course not . I 'm sure you know that that was not my point at all ? " " It has come to my attention , Lady Elnear , that you actually have a psion , a Hydran halfbreed , a telepath , employed on your personal staff . Is n't that true ? " Elnear flushed ; for a second her gaze left Stryger 's face , flashed out over the watchers . The readouts jumped and changed colors below her . " Well . . . yes , I do . . . but ? " Beside me Jardan murmured a curse . I felt her sudden useless fury as she looked at me . " What possible reason could you have for employing a member of a group known for its instability and criminality , its destructive effect on society ? I hardly need to remind anyone here of what would have happened to the Federation if the psionic renegade called Quicksilver had successfully seized control of the Federation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't believe in holding an entire group responsible for the actions of a few of its members , " Elnear said . . She recovered fast . " There is a long history of persecution of psions  --  both Hydran and human  --  by the Federation . I have always tried to judge individuals on their own abilities . " " This individual , who serves as your personal aide , has a criminal record . Were you aware that he was one of the psions who conspired with the terrorist Quicksilver to hold the Federation 's telhassium supply for ransom ? " Elnear broke off again , her mouth still halfway open for speech . " No , I was n't aware .... " " His record also includes assault , theft , and drug abuse ... an all too typical record .... "  | I swore softly . How the he/1 did he find out ? It was n't in the public records . And he was making me out to be a traitor , and that was a goddamn lie . I wanted to shout it out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arm as I started to get up , jerking me around . " Move ! " she hissed at me . I felt her rage transfer through her hand and up my arm , into my head . " Before you do any more damage . " " But it 's a lie ? " " Shut up , you fool . " She dragged me toward the closest exit , her mind a nightmare of what would happen if those hypers gathered like a pack of dogs around us got hold of me . " It 's hard for me to believe that with the security access available to you , you would n't have known about such a thing , " Stryger was baying . " How you could possibly consider such a person suitable to work for you , unless there was some other reason .... " I did n't give Jardan any more argument ; I just followed , as fast as I could , keeping my head down until we reached the door . The door read our IDs and released , letting us out without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I heard Elnear protesting , felt her rising desperation drowned in my mind by the rising excitement of the crowd . And then the door sealed shut behind us , cutting off her voice , and that was the last I heard . The cold , sheer-walled tunnel of street was silent and empty , except for the floating banks of lights high above us . Security had cleared everything for levels around before the debate started . As we stopped outside Jardan turned suddenly , before I even had time to react , and hit me . " Damn it , Jardan ? " I gasped . " God damn you ! " I saw the furious tears backing up in her eyes . She said , " The worst part is that Stryger is right about psions ! " " Wait a minute ? " Pain began to throb behind my own eyes , frustration trying to beat its way out . A mod dropped down from somewhere , answering her summons . ChemEnGen 's logo was on its side . She climbed into it ; tried to slam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She let me in , but only because she remembered how much worse it would be for Elnear if she left me there for the hypers to find . She sat back in her seat , pressing into the formfoam . The mod began to drone , " Destination please , destination please , destination please , " until she finally gave it orders . " Damn it , " I said . " It 's Stryger , not me ! " She looked back at me , wiping fiercely at her face . " If you did n't  | exist , there was nothing he could have done to her nothing . That was true , what he said about you . Was n't it ? ' ? " Her hand tightened into a fist . " No ! He twisted it around . I 'm not a traitor . " " You do n't have a criminal record ? " " Yeah , but . . . . " But nobody was supposed to know that ... . It was n't my fault . . . . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd lost Elnear the debate , and maybe the vote , and the Council . . . her freedom , the freedom of every psion . By being a psion . The answer to Stryger 's prayers . I shut my eyes , put my hands over my ears , bit my lip , stopped breathing . . . . To keep my brain from screaming out loud . The pain circled my head like a knotted cord , tightening . . . eased off as I slowly got myself under control again . After a few more deep breaths , I opened my eyes . Jardan was rigid in her seat , staring at me like she thought she was trapped with a lunatic . I lowered my hands , wove my fingers together in the space between my knees to steady them . She looked away from me finally , wishing we were already at our destination , wishing I 'd disappear . The mod went on silently through the hollow streets , the endless muted silvers and grays , blue-greens and golds , the steel and composite caverns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fossilized insect sealed in high-tech amber , heading toward some destination I did n't have any control over . We 'd been supposed to go back to the FTA plex after the debate ; but that was n't really an option , now . I wondered how much longer the questions would go on behind us , how long Elnear would have to face them down . I began to sweat just thinking about having those bloodsucking hypers after my throat . I wondered where we were going , where Jardan thought she could hide me from them . At last we funneled into one of the arching legs that straddled the river on the western edge of the city . The inner skin of the tube was fleshed with more city , with offices and townhouses . The mod homed in on one of them , tracking its electronic scent like a hound until we were setting down on a terrace somewhere high above the river . A taMing townhouse . I remembered that there was going to be a reception here tonight , for Elnear , after the debate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Elnear 's biggest worry about tonight had been that parties wasted her time . I could n't look down along the glass-smooth , green/black building  | front as we crossed the black mirror of the polished terrace . Looking up along its curve was nearly as bad . I followed Jardan in through the high , lacquered doors , into a dark entry hall . Clatter and conversation reached us from a distance ; I could feel the electricity of minds overloading with last-minute preparation for tonight . But here , just inside the entrance , it was still quiet , and we were still alone . Jardan turned on me , hard-eyed . Her hand gripped my arm until it spasmed . " Follow me . Say nothing . " She led me through the townhouse , avoiding everyone as she took me up in a lift three or four levels . She left me in a cramped , stuffy room that passed for a study , even though I knew by the dead smell of the air that no one ever used it . " Keep the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has spoken to you . Do you understand me ? " I nodded , and she left me there alone . I stood in the middle of the room , without even the strength to move , staring around me . The room was high and narrow , like everything about this place . At its end there was a high , narrow window . Outside the early evening light was slanting across the river ; shadows were filling in the valleys of the city 's carapace . The space around me was filled with a fungal growth of pale , diseased-looking furniture . I hated the thought of touching anything , afraid it might crumble away like rotting wood , but after a while I got tired of standing . I went toward the window , sat down on the quivering edge of a shelfseat . I could n't hear any sounds now . I stared out at the view of the sheer , shining city wall , the gray-blue river waters rolling by below . A few hours ago it would have seemed beautiful to me ; but suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought about the time when the most important thing in my life had been whether I could scrounge enough food to make it through another week ; when all I 'd cared about was slipping enough stolen goods to a freedrop to make what I owed to the dealerman ; when a tough problem was finding a warm place to sleep at night . When everything was simple : Life , or death . . . . I slumped forward , letting my aching head rest in my hands . When I had n't understood why somebody only had to look at me to hate me . I stayed like that , waiting , while the sky slowly changed beyond the windows and the world blued over . . . until the day was teetering on the edge of night . Then at last I heard the soft sucking sound as the door opened , and Elnear came into the room . I HEARD THE mingled voices of people passing in the hall behind Elnear ; all sound stopped as she closed the door . I got up , while light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood where she was , her body rigid . The anger and betrayal she felt as she faced me at last forced its way in through all my senses . There was nothing soft or weak about her now . . . like understanding , or sympathy , or even pity . I could forget about those . Finally she said , " I hope that Centauri is satisfied . Your presence in my life turned today 's debate into a disaster  --  an exercise in futility . We will certainly lose the upcoming vote on deregulation now . " Which meant she 'd lose the Security Council slot too ; she did n't even need to mention that . " Because of you . " Or that either , but she did . I looked away at the deepening indigo of the sky , back at her . We were both too visible , there was no hiding place , standing here inside this lens of light . I did n't answer , looking at the floor now . " You 're usually quicker on your feet . " There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before . " Are n't you going to argue with me ? At least you usually argue with me . A good saboteur always tries to cover his work , I thought . But then , I suppose your real job is done . And I thought you were only sent here to spy on me . " I looked up . " That ai n't  --  is n't what I 'm here for , goddamn it . It 's not my fault Stryger hates psions . I did n't tell him to nail me ! "  | You could at least have told me , " she said , her voice cold , " that you were a criminal . " " I 'm not ? " I shook my head . " Stryger twisted everything around . I was pardoned . I 'm clean . My record was sealed , buried , nobody can access it any more . I do n't even know how he found out ? " " Anyone can find out anything , with the right contacts . And he certainly has them . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couch . She began to move restlessly back and forth , glancing at me as she moved . " The worst part of the entire ordeal was being accused of conspiring with criminals  --  as if by attempting to keep these drugs restricted , I want to afflict all of humanity with a plague of degenerates and sociopaths ! " Her open hand came down on a tabletop , hard . " I had to agree with him , grant him his point , or look like a liar as well as a hypocrite . . . because of course I agree that criminal behavior and deviancy should be controlled ? " " You mean , like psions ? Is n't it enough they ca n't get hired for most kinds of work ? Ai n't it enough they get drugwiped if they ever get caught using their psi to commit a crime ? Stryger wants them drugwiped the minute they 're born . That 's why he wants pentyptine deregulated . That 's why he wants to be on the Security Council . So then he can have ' em @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make it illegal for them to breathe ? " My voice broke . It had already happened to the Hydrans . . . it had happened to my mother . Now Stryger wanted to make it happen to anybody with a single psi gene drowned in their chromosome pool . I knew what he wanted . . . I knew . I pulled my voice back together . " You said up there that psions deserved to be judged like everybody else , one on one . I almost thought you believed it . You could 've pushed harder , you could 've fought him ? " Except that after what he 'd said , calling me a criminal and a traitor , she had n't wanted to . Stryger was right . The same thought , the same betrayal and disgust as I 'd seen in Jardan 's mind . " You brought this on yourself . " " Half of what he said about me was lies . You believed him , without even makin ' him prove it . Yesterday , I thought you .... ' My empty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what he said about psions is true , " she snapped . " Psions are mentally unstable , sociopaths  --  harming themselves as well as the people around them . " Thinking of Jule , thinking of me . . . the only psions she 'd ever seen . But she knew the stereotype : psions were all  | floaters , freaks , head cases . We 'd only proved the point . " Perhaps they would be better off if their . . . powers were under some kind of control .... " Now she was the one who would n't meet my eyes . Some part of her knew even as she said it that it was n't right , or just ; that it denied everything she had always thought she believed . But she could n't help herself . . . and her guilt only gave her resentment more strength . " That 's what Jule and Siebeling are trying to do , " I said ; trying not to reach out to her mind , not to try to make her see . Knowing that that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To teach psions how to control their own Gift . Like Siebeling did with me , and Jule . That 's how to stop them from getting into trouble . They 're not animals ? " " If all psions were in complete control of their abilities , they would only be tempted to use them against others . Power is the strongest drug of all . You worked for that terrorist Quicksilver . " Parroting Stryger again , the memory burning in her eyes . " He would have crippled the FTA , and torn the entire Federation apart if he had n't been stopped ? " " How do you think the FTA stopped him ? " She did n't answer . She did n't know . " They used psions ! Siebeling , Jule , me , a bunch of others . That 's when I met her . That 's what I was doing out there on Cinder , at the mines . Ask Jule ? " She did n't even know that . All she knew , all any of them still remembered , was that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Quicksilver did n't do it alone , " I said . " He was n't some kind of crazy god . He had plenty of combines backing him . Just like Stryger . But we still stopped him  --  Jule , and Siebeling , and me . " I held up my fist . " I killed Quicksilver myself . I felt him die inside me , and that 's why I ca n't use my psi any more unless I 'm so drugged up I ca n't remember his pain . " I felt tears spill out of my eyes , so suddenly that I did n't have a chance of stopping them . They burned my face like acid , like they had n't done in years , not since the moment after the killing when I 'd realized what I 'd done , to him , to myself . When I 'd looked into my own mind and seen the nothing hole I 'd made of somebody else with my telepathy and a gun : a wound bleeding hate and terror , a wound that would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destroyed the Gift that had become my life . That I was back where I 'd started , blind and alone and going nowhere . . . . I wiped at my face with my hand , choking on sobs . . . feeling nothing . Elnear was staring at me with a kind of horrified fascination , like  | someone watching a burnout scream curses on an Oldcity street-corner . If she 'd had any doubts about whether freaks were all crazy , I 'd just proved it was true . . . . She was backing toward the door . " I think , " she murmured , feeling for the plate on the wall , " that your work for the taMings is probably finished . You have certainly done enough already . " The anger and frustration were back in her voice ; the door flicked open . " Under no circumstances are you to attend the party downstairs . My own Security people are here tonight . They will see that you are removed if you show yourself there . " She left the room . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone again . I sat down , facing out on the view of coming night , blind with tears . Pain like knives stabbed into the back of my eyes . I got up again and stumbled across the room , found the trash can I 'd seen beside the desk and vomited into it . After that my head felt a little better ; but the trembling in my hands went on for a long while . I lay back on the couch , feeling the skin on my face tighten as the tears dried , wondering what in hell was happening to me . Maybe I was sick , maybe I was tired . . . maybe it was starting . Symptoms : My mind eating away at my body because the drugs kept it from eating away at itself . It was sending me a warning , telling me to stop , for God 's sake ? I touched the patch behind my ear . I 'd just been fired , had n't I ? My cover was gone , what was the point in wearing a patch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried to make my fingers peel off the patch . What about Elnear ? Somebody was still trying to kill her ; that had n't changed . " Fuck her ? " I said . But that did n't do anything except make me feel lousier . I 'd ruined her life . What did I expect her to do , thank me ? Besides , it was Braedee who 'd hired me , and he had n't fired me yet . Maybe I should wait . I needed the money . I needed ... . I pulled my knees up , rested my head on a crust of pillows , feeling my anger slowly melt down into a puddle of envy . I listened with my mind to the rising murmur of mental noise , guests arriving , filling the levels of the townhouse below me . Elnear had said she hated parties , they were a waste of time . She was probably going to hate this one more than usual . But I 'd felt her , somewhere in the back of her mind , remembering a time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the company of the best of the best ... when she 'd been giddy with wine and laughter ; when every word had sparkled like diamonds , when every sensation was a perfect counterpoint playing on all her senses at once ; when she 'd been in love ... . I could n't help wondering what that would feel like , to have  | everything you ever wanted , even happiness . It had n't lasted for her ? but what ever did ? I 'd thought at least I 'd get to taste it for one night ? But now any memories I 'd have of tonight would have to he stolen ones . I let my psi slide into the white water of those hundreds of minds , all of them together but forever alone , even in a place like this . I collided with random bits of image and emotion , collecting them : someone else 's eyes falling on a beautiful woman wearing a gown of jewels , the sudden taste of fresh kiskfruit rind dripping with chocolate , the smell of roses and imported incense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone 's blood-red nails traced a slow line down someone's/my backbone . It was all so easy , they were all so blind ... . I lost myself inside their pleasure , sinking deeper into fantasies , letting myself be rich and famous , fire and ice ... a psion . I sat up on the couch , jerked out of my peepshow dreams as my mind wandered in through the wrong open door . But I 'd been loose and careless , not trying to guard my own thoughts , knowing none of those deadheads would ever know the difference . Except this one was n't a deadhead . It had been a man  --  that was all I knew for sure before he knew , and cut me off in sudden panic . I lunged after him , let my mind fall like a net over the sea of stars-in-darkness that was the party down below . But he was gone , losing himself in the void that kept those stars separate forever . He was n't very good  --  but neither was I , and one thing he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hunt after a while , leaning back as I sank into playing voyeur again . I was better at that , and Braedee did n't want me digging up family secrets anyway . . . . The odor of warm flesh and perfume ; the electric shock of sudden humiliation ; braying laughter ; synth music ... . The door opened . I sat up fast ; afraid it was Elnear who 'd come back and caught me jerking off my brain . But it was Daric instead . He spasmed with surprise , as if the last thing in the world he 'd expected to see here was another human being . . . or me . He laughed ; it cut off like a stick snapping . " Well , hello . " He came on into the room , every movement full of angular momentum . " So this is where she 's exiled you to . . . . The Cat 's out of the bag , so I hear . " He raised his eyebrows , smirking at some joke I did n't get . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be safe anywhere . You 're a marked man , to the hypers . . . you 're famous . Poor Auntie 's ready to make violin strings out of your guts . "  | I sat forward , pressing the heels of my hands into my eyes as my head started to throb again . " I do n't mean to intrude . I can tell you must be having a marvelous time , hiding out up here all alone while the party of the century goes on without you , just out of reach downstairs . " I heard him pass close by me as he crossed the room . " Has n't she even brought you up a cup of lukewarm tea and a handful of crumbs ? Thoughtless  --  but then , she 's having such a wonderful time , herself .... " " Jeezu ! " I said . " You 're really an asshole . " I raised my head . He turned back , staring at me , but not really seeing me . " You 're right .... " There was surprise on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first time in a mirror . " You 're very perceptive about human nature . But then I suppose all telepaths are . " His mouth slid into another mocking smile . I swore and stood up , sick of being one of his sick jokes . I started for the door , not knowing where I was going , but only that I had to get away from this . " Cat , wait ? " I stopped , turned around . He was wearing the best imitation of a real face that I 'd ever seen on him . He bent his head to one side . " Listen , I am sorry . I have made an ass of myself . You 're absolutely right . And absolutely honest , which is more than I can say for anyone else around here , including myself . " He lifted his hands in a shrug . " Do n't go . How about a truce ? I wo n't make fun of you , if you promise not to tell the truth . " I felt my face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't say anything . But he only turned back to what he was doing , which was putting his hand through what looked like a solid sculpture hanging on the wall . His arm disappeared up to his elbow , came out again holding a small ceramic box . He set the box down on the desk . " My drugs , " he said . He pulled it open with a kid 's guilty grin ; showing off , waiting for my reaction . When I still did n't say anything , he took out plastic sheets covered with colored dots and began to peel them off one at a time . He decorated his forehead with blues and greens ; stuck on a double line of golds and reds around his throat inside the open collar of his neat gray tunic ; shoved a purple one down the front of his pants . " Ahh , that 's better . " " I hope you know what the hell you 're doing , " I said finally . " Because I 'm not going to scrape you off the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of course I do . .. . How about you ? I hear you 're an experienced drug abuser from way back . Help yourself . " He waved me toward the half-empty sheets . I shook my head . " I do n't use , any more . " There was a time when I 'd tried anything anybody 'd sell me , trying to find the one that could fill the empty place where something nameless had been torn loose inside me ; the one that could take away the pain of living through another day on the streets . I was lucky I was still alive . I did n't need drugs , any more . . . . Suddenly my hand wanted to reach up behind my ear , to feel the patch , to rip it off . Or maybe to make sure it was still in place . I kept my arm down at my side . Daric looked at me , half puzzled , half frowning . I tried to make myself find out what was going on in his mind . I got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it the electric song of barely controlled tension , aimless strands of disgust and loathing . . . . His mind was like a jungle , the drugs filling it in with impenetrable vines of random sensation as they opened up all his senses . I could n't get any further , pushing against the limits of my crippled psi . Dark sighed , a smile of pure pleasure stretching his face out like a piece of plastic . " Much better . " He looked like someone who 'd just had a knife blade moved away from his throat ; I could almost feel him relaxing . No wonder he liked drugs . I watched him shove the box back through the sculpture into its hiding place . " I have no intention of staying around here for more of the overdressed dog and pony show downstairs . Trust me , you 're really not missing a thing . A vicious , meaningless , and ultimately boring game of Beasts and Victims , that 's all it is . I 'm having my own private party , down at Purgatory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tonight . I 'm going there now . All my favorite people are going to be there . . . . Do you want to come ? " His eyes brightened with sudden eagerness . " Come with me . You 'll be a sensation ! " I blinked , stared , not really believing I 'd heard him ask . I shook my head . " I ca n't . " He raised his eyebrows . " Why not ? Are you afraid the hypers will eat you alive ? No one will even know we 're gone . You 'll be safe . " I thought about it , hit with a sudden rush of excitement as I imagined getting free of this prison , feeling alive and real , for even one night ? " I . . . I 'm supposed to stay here . I 've got to do my job . Braedee ? " " Braedee ? " He laughed . " Do you really think Braedee cares  | what you do now ? I ) o you really think Elnear does ? .. . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the middle of this crowd ? Besides , everyone here has been scanned right down to their entrails for weapons . " He strolled toward me , reached out to jog my arm . " They do n't need you , " he said gently . " Do n't take yourself so seriously . No one else does . " I jerked away from his hand . He shrugged . Irritation showed in his eyes , was gone again . " Do what you like . Sit here and sulk . Pretend you matter . " He turned away , starting for the door . " You had your chance .... " " All right . I 'll come . " He turned back , grinning . " I promise you a night you 'll never forget . . . . You sure you do n't want any drugs ? " " No thanks , " I said . I 've got all I need . I FOLLOWED DARIC out of the room , through a maze of empty back hallways , down a lift that only servants used . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of light/noise/motion , into darkness/ silence again . I could feel him still grinning up ahead of me , lighting up my brain with his pleasure buzz , counterpointing the dry empty throbbing in my own head . We came out at last in some kind of subbasement garage , where half a dozen private mods sat waiting for people who needed a quick escape . As we stepped out of the lift into the shadowed underworld , someone materialized from behind a pillar . I swore , jerking up short .  | But Daric only laughed , and pulled me forward . " J Wu ! " he called . " Good boy , you escaped them . Look who I 've found to join us . " Jiro stepped out into the light . His hair was still wild , and halt his face was streaked with blood-colored paint . He was wearing a brocade jacket with one sleeve missing , over a torn shirt over a striped ankle-length tunic . It took me a minute to realize he had n't been in some kind of accident . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ static of his excitement faded , broken by the sudden blankness of uncertainty , sharp pangs of doubt and curiosity . He knew , just like everybody else did now . " Cat .... " His shoulders twitched . " Are you . . . I mean , are you really a freak ? Are you ... you know .. . reading my mind all the time ? " His eyes were bright and dark , the whites showing . " He knows our every secret , do n't you , Cat ? " Daric murmured . " No , " I said , as evenly as I could . " I 'm not a freak . I 'm a psion . And no , " I said again , ignoring Daric 's laugh , " I 'm not reading your mind all the time . You 're not that interesting . " Jiro frowned . Daric 's laughter goaded me out into the open space . Jiro skittered backwards as I passed him , came forward again , almost treading on my heels as he tried to prove something to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like there were two of me sitting side by side . The mod delivered us right to the door of Purgatory , Argentyne 's private club ; what I saw of the Deep End around it made me damn glad of that . We climbed out into the glare of a hundred different hologos dancing in the darkness overhead , stepped over a burnout sprawled in the gutter . Jiro coughed from the stink of a garbage fire somewhere down the block . A gang of street slugs done in gold teeth and threedy paint gave us the eye as they pounded past . The one thing I had n't been expecting to see was the way the city 's sealed dome arced down into the bay , creating more breathing space , reclaiming the bottom of the sea . Argentyne 's club was just offshore  --  the black wall of water rose halfway up the dome here , drowning the stars in half the night 's sky . I do n't know what I 'd thought a place run by Daric taMing 's lover would look like . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ancient cement-block warehouse , with the word " Purgatory " holoed in red crawling endlessly over its face like a blind worm . Daric strode across the dirt-blackened bricks of the pavement as if he owned this part of town , and went down the shallow stairwell to the club 's entrance . He touched something on the rusted iron door that sent out a  | silent call . I followed after him , staying close to Jiro , who was sparking with his own nervous energy . He was so high on excitement that I almost thought he 'd been taking drugs ; but his mind was clear when I checked him . At least Daric had n't made his stepbrother the same offer he 'd made me. t knew Jiro liked Argentyne , but I was surprised Daric would bring a kid like him to the Deep End . Argentyne was a symbplayer ; like magicians , they worked your head best if they did it live . But Jiro had said she was famous . She must do gigs in bigger and better places than this . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind it recognized Daric . Cinnamon smoke and screaming laughter reached out and dragged us inside . " Welcome to Purgatory ! " A face , or a mask , pushed into mine  --  I could n't tell which from the leering smile . Young or old , male or female . . . somewhere inside all that I found a man 's mind , or thought I did . " Not quite heaven , not quite hell . . . . " His breath stank from skagweed . His hand grabbed my wrist , inside a swirl of translucent glitter cloth , yellows and golds , and he hauled me forward , shooing Jiro ahead down the hallway . " Your first time , pretty ? " I was n't sure if he was talking to me , or Jiro , or both of us . If Argentyne wanted to keep out anybody who did n't have a sense of humor , she was doing a good job . We half stumbled , half slid down a dark ramp . It dumped us out into the middle of a madhouse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the crowd , shouting and waving his arms ; the crowd parted around him like a sentient sea , and voices called his name . I stood at the bottom of the ramp , weaving my mind into a fist in self-defense as Jiro plunged out into the shifting mass of bodies after Daric . Still just trying to take it all in  --  the vast , scarred womb that was the club 's interior , the glaring , pounding music that filled it like an invisible force , trying to split open its walls . . . the people . They looked like they 'd been bodysnatched and dropped down here from every age , every world , every imaginable level of human life . They wore lace and brocade , leather and rags , grafts , jewels , chains and batteries , plastic , hair , skins and bones . I felt like a mark , still wearing combine colors . Daric 's ultraconservative suit looked so wrong that it actually made him seem to belong here . Some of the guests hugged him , kissed him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were n't natives  --  bored vips escaping like he was from their own respectability , trying too hard to seem like they fit in . I could spot that kind in my sleep .  | Behind me , flanking the entrance , there were two bouncers huge grotesques who 'd had themselves built into shells of augmented alloy that made them damn near indestructible . Near the wall on my left three more or less naked men were wrestling in a pool of green jelly , splattering the shrieking onlookers with slime . Four gilled , sexless exotics did an underwater ballet inside a clear bubble of glass drifting past overhead . One of them put a hand against the glass , gazing down at me . Slowly I reached up , stretching to meet it ; the hand twitched away as I touched the glass . Its owner was gone in a swirl of silent laughter . A pair of chained-up black dogs yelped and snapped at me as I edged past them and out into the room . The strange danced with strangers , shaking and flailing like they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jewel-colored cushions by low tables covered with food and drinks . There was nothing here I had n't seen before , but 1 'd never seen it all in one place .... There were clubs in Oldcity more bizarre than this , but I 'd never had the credit line to get past their doors . There was a stage at the far end of the room . It was empty now , the only spot in the place where nothing was going on . Musicians were performing all around the club ; each one singing , playing something different , lost in some separate auditory hallucination . And yet somehow it was all one sound ; half a dozen kinds of synths playing half a dozen kinds of songs fusing into one perfect web of music , the changing rhythms meshing like gears . . . Argentyne 's symb . I 'd never heard one this good . But I did n't see Argentyne anywhere ; there was no lightsong happening yet either . She must be the spirit , the one who did the visuals , who made it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my body twitching to passing rhythms , my vision changing color as I passed through bands of amplified light , searching for Daric and Jiro . My eyes did a double take as my sight suddenly turned black-and-white . All the color was missing from the far corner of the room . I looked down at myself , back at the people around me ; we were all still in living color . I reached the split in reality , stepped across it . I turned black-and-white , like everyone and everything around me . I stepped back again , not ready to go colorblind . Someone pushed a drink into my hand . It was Daric , from out of nowhere , with a couple of female exotics hanging on him . " Come on , Cat . Do something . I promised everyone you 'd be interesting ? " I took the drink . It was blue and steaming . I tapped Daric 's thoughts just long enough to be sure it was n't loaded . It was safe  | enough . I took a sip . " Where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Iie should n't he here at all . " One of the women blew kisses at me with tattooed green lips . Daric laughed . " My God , you sound like Auntie ! I thought you were supposed to be some kind of wild boy ; I thought this was your clement . Do n't get stiff on me ? " " I 'll get him stiff .... " One of the women oozed away from him , toward me . I backed up , and behind me someone else 's hand slid down over my ass . I jerked forward again . The woman with a single horn growing out of her forehead threw her arms around me . There was something long and shapeless squirming in her hand , something grayish-pink and wrinkled . " This is a suckworm , " she whispered . " Guess what it does .... " She pushed it at me , trying to slip it into my clothes . I let my disgust slam into her brain without control , without warning . She squealed and fell back . Daric did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard on the floor , blinking , dazed . " Well , fuck you , " she said , to nobody in particular . She picked up the worm and crawled away through a forest of legs . The crowd around Daric murmured , and I heard a ripple of applause . " What did I tell you ? " Daric said to them . " Mental powers ! " I turned back to him . " I used to live off divers like you  --  night trippers with fat credit , pretending they were something they were n't . You think this is all a big joke . You 're wrong . I do n't want Jiro hurt . Where is he ? " Daric winced . " You 're telling me the truth again . That 's against the rules ? " He raised his hands as my own hand made a fist . " He 's safe ! He 's backstage with Argentyne . She 'll watch over him like a nanny , he 's in perfect ecstasy . Relax . " He shrugged , still amused . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a kaleidoscope , leather and lace , flesh and fur . " Meet your fans , Cat . It 's such perfect timing . . . . Today you became notorious , a media star . Tonight you can celebrate it , among people who really understand what it means to be unique , a freak ? " I grimaced , taking another gulp of my drink as he dragged me through the crowd to a table next to the stage . " My personal table , my guest of honor . " He caught my shoulders , chivvying me around . " You 'll have a perfect view of Argentyne 's performance from here . Sit down ? " He pushed me down onto a pillow in the sea of colored cushions , keeping an arm around my shoulders . His face was flushed ,  | his eyes were too bright ; he looked like a man with a fever . Excitement , eagerness , pride  --  I was his prize catch , a moment 's inspired impulse , proof to the inhabitants of the Deep End that he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He lived his double life with a vengeance that was hard to believe . Flaunting Argentyne at the family estates was only the surface membrane of his secret self , a hint to his family that if they dared to push through it they 'd find a lot more secrets than they were ready for . He played the perfect combine vip by day , but it was only a role , just like the jaded deeve he played here by night . I wondered what the real Daric was , or where , or whether there was anything at all behind the masks . The seats around me at the table filled up before I had time to set down my drink , and the questions started flowing . " Is it true that psions ? " " ? tell me what ? " " Read my mind ! " " What 's your Prime ? " " How does it feel . . . ? " I let the hungry curiosity seep into my brain , the eager titillation as they waited for me to rape their minds with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pleasure  --  a new kind of drug . As the drink loosened me up I started to let myself believe that nobody around me hated my guts , or wanted to get away from me , or was actually laughing at me inside . At least I knew what kind of people these were ; at least here I did n't have to worry about everything I did , everything I said , even the way I said it . . . . I felt myself relaxing for the first time in days . I answered their questions , out loud at first , until I saw that that was n't what they wanted . Then I answered them with my mind  --  slowly , gently , so that nobody panicked . They giggled and held their heads like children . Daric smiled with anticipation , not asking any questions of his own . " Read my mind ? " the woman with scales glittering on her skin whispered again beside me . She licked her lips with a slitted tongue . ( I do n't need to . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off my drink , and there were two more in front of me before I could even ask . I took a meat-filled bun from one of the platters heaped with food in the center of the table , bit into it , still grinning . Across the table from me a bald , thick-necked slug in patchwork leather was stuffing food into his mouth as fast as he could , choking it down , hardly bothering to breathe . He 'd cleared off half the platter closest to him already . I watched him eat for a minute longer ; realized I was forgetting to chew the food in my own mouth . I glanced away , at a couple a few cushions past him . They could have been male or female or both , and they were slowly peeling away each others ' clothes , like somebody  | peeling the layers of an onion . Somebody else began to give me a hack ruh while I watched , kneading my neck and shoulders , pressing their thumbs into the hollows along my spine . It felt good , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even looking around . I answered more questions as the crowd around me changed again . I drank more drinks , ate more food from the tray that never seemed to get completely empty , while everything began to feel better and better . I 'd had dreams about this : about being at the center of a diver 's private fantasy , as an equal . . . . I felt myself letting go , an almost physical thing , as if my bones were melting and my body was moving away in seven different directions at once . My mind began to drift , floating in a warm , hazy sea of acceptance , where the only tension was sexual , and there was no fear at all . After a while Jiro came dancing out from behind the stage . He jumped down into the cushions beside us , panting , his face flushed with excitement , and wriggled like a puppy into a spot beside Dane . As he settled in , the music that had been all around us until I did n't even hear it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop everything and look toward the stage . Reality shrugged , and suddenly the stage was n't empty any more . Shimmering above it now was a gleaming black filament like the web of some mutant bloodspider . There were human victims , half a dozen men or what looked like them , dangling in the wires , with blood or something like it dripping from their wounds . The air smelled like ozone . I shut my eyes and looked at them with my mind , and they were the musicians who 'd been playing all around us . They were still playing , still hooked into the symb net . Their writhing agony was a freeform dance , tied to the heartbeat of their music . I heard Jiro suck in his breath , half frowning as he tried to guess whether what he saw was real . Knowing it could n't be , but still not sure " It 's just an act , " I said . He nodded , frowned a little deeper , pushing his hair back from his eyes . " I know that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stage again as lightning played down the web . Argentyne was there , suddenly , drifting down through the web like some pitiless goddess of death , her hair a shockwave of silver white . Black leather cupped her like the petals of a nightflower ; black silk fringe slid over bare flesh like the groping hands of her victims , reaching out for mercy as she passed . As her feet hit the floor she began to sing , swiveling out of the web and along the tongue of stage  | in spike-heeled killer shoes , stretching her silvered arms to embrace the crowd . Watching her strut it was hard to take my eyes off her ; almost impossible to separate her from the beat that drove her motion in through every pore of my body , or her voice from the reverberating air . I could n't make out the words she was singing , even as they etched themselves across my brain , like acid eating its way into glass .. . a song about men and women , a song of war , in and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and as she moved her flesh began to heave and buckle , as if something monstrous inside her was trying to force its way out . With the music screaming , her perfect flesh tore open like rubber . Glistening limbs flailed , pushed , burst free , her mutilated body fell away , withering like a cocoon ... . ... about getting inside each others ' skins , would it really be so different ? .. . A silver-haired man , the sheen of sweat on the silver flesh laid bare above his tight black leather pants , heavy codpiece , thigh-high armored boots . Armed to the teeth , he raised a metal-studded fist to the crowd , and his voice was Argentyne 's , and no one else 's but his own . ... Would it really still be war ? And he turned , and Argentyne was waiting there behind him . Alone , defenseless , she held up her hand , as if she could stop his slow , hungry advance on her by nothing but willpower ... . And the gun dropped from his hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ velvet as red as blood ; as his face contorted and the music screamed while a hand struggled out through his mouth ... as his body exploded like porcelain dropped from a height . A silver-haired woman in a red velvet gown emerged like a snake , shedding the man 's skin , shuddering free of it as it sloughed to the floor , kicking it away . I watched Argentyne walk toward Argentyne , undulating like the sea . As they passed each other like figures in a mirror , the two women lifted their hands , blowing kisses , while Argentyne segued into the final verse of her song ... ... if you were a woman , and I was a man ... inside the other side of life tonight .. . The crowd howled , its voice strobing inside sound like a sun gone nova . . . as Argentyne appeared and disappeared , moving through curtains of synthesized reality , shouting and applause . . . to settle , as the music rolled away and the visions faded , into the space that had somehow opened for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hardly believing she was actually right beside me . She looked back at me , blinking with a kind of startled recognition as she realized she 'd seen me before . As she realized now , like everyone else did , what I really was . " Argentyne . . . magnificent .. . " Daric murmured . He put his arms around her , kissing her lips , her throat , her breasts . . . laying claim to her and all that she was , all that she 'd just created , in a way that nobody who saw them could fail to understand . She did n't resist him , dissolving against his body , turning the kiss into an extension of what she 'd done on the stage , still radiating the white heat of her performance energy . What drove into my dazzled brain then surprised me as much as anything I 'd just seen on the stage : she actually wanted him , wanted to feel his lips against her skin , and it was her own pleasure that let the contact continue long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like everybody else was watching them , with the heat of Argentyne 's energy still burning inside me , mutating , shifting , getting hotter ; Daric 's arousal , my own . . . . Slowly realizing that there was a whole hidden layer of sensation that only I could share , out of everyone in that room who saw them . I shared it , hungry , greedy , not able to stop myself . . . knowing all the while that they knew I knew , and wanted me to know , and liked it that way ... . They broke apart at last , to more whistles and howls . Jiro sat gaping , caught somewhere between awe and panic . Daric looked straight at me , grinning , still with one arm holding Argentyne close . He said , " How did you like the show ? " He did n't mean just the one on stage . I grinned too , leaning back in the soft embrace of the pillows . I could sense the entire room now , as I let my focus dissolve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wild energies . . . feel it all funnel back along the lines of contact until my mind felt like a star . I let out a little of that raw fissioning fire , feeding it into him , into Argentyne , into every mind around me at the table ; letting them feel exactly how much I enjoyed it . There were gasps and giggles , aftershocks of stunned disbelief , and then everyone 's eyes were on me again . They all wanted more  --  The slug across the table even stopped eating for long enough to look up at me . I opened myself to them , feeling the contact ebb and flow as I dropped the circuit breakers in my mind . A strangled laugh escaped from Daric . I felt his craving for the forbidden touch .. . the terror that squeezed it , compressed it until it became a kind of lust . . . . I broke contact with him as I suddenly remembered Jiro . Jiro was staring at me too , his throat working . He was even more terrified of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but he was trying desperately to look like he 'd enjoyed it , to look like everybody else . I wanted to say something to him , but then Argentyne leaned away from Daric , toward me , looking directly into my eyes with all her attention ; really seeing me for the first time . " That was incredible , " she murmured . She laughed , shaking out the silver mane of her hair . I felt her enjoy the feel of it down her back , felt her titillated by the sensation of thoughts turned inside out ; felt her wanting to feel another mind run its fingers through her own again . I brushed her mind with an image , and she shivered . " I 'm ruined .... " she said , her voice caressing me like warm fingers . " You 're like silk . Accessing is going to feel like sandpaper in my brain for the rest of my life . You 've ruined me with one touch .... " Her hand reached out this time , brushing my cheek . She was only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pulling her away . She glanced at him , more amused than annoyed , pulling her spike-heeled feet in closer to her on the cushions . " You brought him here , love . Let us enjoy him . We do n't see nearly as many psions here on Earth as you worldjumpers do . " " Why not ? " I asked , half realizing that down here where nothing was a surprise , telepaths should n't be as interesting as I seemed to be to them . " This is Earth , " Daric said , his smile twitching with spite . " Psions are . . . well , abnormal . " He shrugged . " They 're discouraged from settling here . They might pollute the stock . " His eyes moved , not meeting mine , as his own paranoia suddenly set in again . My anger shot out past my control , spilled over into the open lines of my mind and hit him . The people gathered around the table jerked and gasped . . . laughed , nervously . Daric wiped at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . Eager again , in a way that should have made me want to get away from him . But the warm feedback of everyone else 's acceptance melted my anger , dissolved my resentment . I could n't hold onto my thoughts , any more than I seemed to be able to keep them to myself . . . and somehow I did n't even care that something was going wrong . " Have you ever plugged in ? " Argentyne asked , leaning toward me again , her copper-colored eyes intent . " Have you ever worked a symb circuit ? Would you like to try ? " Do what she did  --  the music , the images , creating a mass hallucination out of the artist 's imagination . I shook my head . " God 's teeth , " she said , " you 'd be astounding ? you could make people live what they see and hear . The ultimate . "  | " " l'hat 's socketwork . It 's illegal , " I said , the words flat , " for psions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , they drugwipe you . " " If I could create that kind of effect , even once , " she said , " it would he worth it . " " It 's not your brain . " She shrugged , and the petals of black leather she 'd been wearing were suddenly watercolor silk . I blinked , wondered what she was really wearing . . . . The image I was trying not to form inside my head formed anyway , and leaked . More tittering laughter . Argentyne smiled . " Fairly accurate , " she said . Daric 's frown came back , but he only kissed the back of her neck , and said . " Argentyne , Jiro would like to dance with you , but he does n't know how to ask . " She turned away , looking toward Jiro . " Delighted . " She pushed to her feet in a wash of liquid color , and took Jiro 's hand . Jiro scrambled up , speechless , and followed her away toward the dance floor . I watched her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the silk until she disappeared into the crowd . I left a strand of thought tied to her mind even after I lost sight of her . As I looked back , across the table from me the Eater stuck his finger down his throat , and puked into the bucket waiting beside him on the floor . When he was finished he began to eat again . More bodies slid into the empty spaces beside Daric , like sand funneling into a pit . I turned to look at the grotesque who was shoving in beside me . The wall of his chest had been replaced with a transparent synthetic . Blood pulsed though veins , wet purple and gray organs churned , muscles slid and contracted . He stared back at me , just as curious . Something warm and wet circled my ear , probed inside it . I jerked around , startled . The woman with the long , slitted tongue was back , kneeling behind me . The tongue that had just been in my ear licked her lips again , left them wet and glistening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ massaging my chest . Her eyes were a golden yellow ; her pupils were long slits , like mine should have been . But hers had been engineered to look that way , the way mine had been engineered to look human . The thin film of scales on her skin caught the light , gleaming like a sheen of sweat . I reached up , touching her face . The scales felt warm and dry , softer than I 'd imagined . Her lips were very soft , opening as I rose up on my knees to kiss them . Her tongue slid into my mouth , as casually as if it belonged there ; stayed there , investigating every  | corner , while our kiss went on and on , and a hot throbbing pressure grew between my legs . I heard a whimper , a stilled groan , from somewhere around the table . I tried to break off the kiss , looking back at Daric . I caught an unfocused flash of his knowing smile , someone else behind him , arms circling his waist . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back and around and down into the cushions beside her . Long deft fingers slid down the seal on my shirt , pulled it open , raked my skin with sharp nails and left me burning . I reached up , cupping her breasts with my hands through the gaps in her slitted ivory gown . She squirmed and sighed , with my pleasure and hers , lowering herself until my lips could reach her . I covered one of her nipples with my mouth . Sounds and movement were all around me now , as the others at the table began to melt and flow together in my heat , their heat radiating back along the sizzling filaments of contact into my brain , until it was all one molten sea , and I was sinking into it , " . . . do n't . . . stop ... " i ! I Begging to drown . 11 Someone else 's hands seemed to be pulling at me , hands everwhere , peeling off my shirt , sliding over my skin . . . unfastening my pants , setting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and moans of delight . The scaled woman 's tongue was back inside my mouth now , going deeper . Something sweet and sticky was trickling from a pitcher onto my belly ... someone was licking it off ... Daric was beside me , smiling , his breath coming in shallow gasps as he lifted my hand . He sucked on my fingers , one by one  --  sank his teeth into the flesh between my thumb and forefinger until he tasted my blood . I screamed and jerked , screams echoing around me as he gasped and let go , falling back with my pain inside his head . He crawled forward again and dumped a freezing cold drink onto my naked skin . Gasped with my pain again , and laughed " I struggled to sit up but the hands weighed me down , the mouths , the bodies . . . soothing , stroking , caressing , probing . Until my bones were rubber and my mind flowed into the drowning pool again , helplessly willing . Something warm and shapeless flopped onto my chest . I lifted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oozing pool of syrup . Panting , I watched it squirm along my belly to the music of their laughter . . . waiting for it , helpless with their hunger , burning with their need , screaming inside . Their hands held me down with silken cords of muscle and flesh , as they drank in the sweet juice of my yearning , the vinegar of my disgust ... .  | " Jeeru ! " Argentync 's face swam into sight above me . " What the hell are you doing ? ? " Staring down at us , her eyes widening enough to take it all in . I had a sudden strobe flash of what it looked like from where she stood , driven into my brain by the force of her incredulity disgust *arousal* anger *arousal* disbelief *arousal* disgust 1 tried to struggle , tried to hold onto her anger , to push free of the soft , yielding heaviness that was suffocating my will like a pillow of flesh . . . could n't . " Argentyne , come on ? " Daric crawled on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He reached out for her , pulling himself up her body . " Come and feel the real thing .... " Argentyne punched him hard in the gut , doubling him over . She began to turn away , and I grimaced as I saw Jiro 's face behind her . She blinded Jiro with a sudden slap . " You keep your face out of this ! Stay there . " She turned back , stepping over Daric 's head , shoving half naked bodies out of her way as she leaned down and picked the worm off of my belly . She hurled it away . " This is my club , I put on the floor shows here . Get your clothes on and get out , you shiteaters . " She kicked a few more bodies ; their pain went off in my head like explosives in a sea of mud . I groaned and rolled over as everything imploded ; burying my hard-on in the pillows . " You ? " Her hand caught my shoulder , wrenching me back into the light again . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your freakshow someplace else . " I struggled with my pants , struggled with my brain , my thoughts still running out of me like diarrhea . " I ca n't .... " " Like hell . " She fastened my pants for me , making me gasp ; picked up my shirt and threw it in my face . I could n't sit up . I managed to get over onto my hands and knees . All I could feel now was her , no room left in my mind for any thought , any choice , any decision of my own . " I ca n't . . . help it , " shaking my head . It did n't do any good . She was standing over me , staring down at my back . I felt her eyes catch on something , felt the giddy change of direction as she leaned over to pick it off my neck like a flea . A patch . " No , wait ? " I put up my hand , but the patch behind my ear was still there . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while she studied the patch on her fingertip . Her face twisted . She flicked it away . A dose of easy . It took away your inhibitions and your selfcontrol ; made it easy to do anything . . . . I felt the anger drain out of  | her/me . Not wanting it to go ; wanting to he able to feel my own . All right , " she said gently , " I guess the boy ca n't help it , after all . " She reached down , helping me to my feet . " You understand what happened ? " she asked me . " Somebody drugged you . " I nodded . " I think you 're going to be ready to kick some ass in a few minutes , " she said . " Or you should be . " She let go of me and turned away . Daric was on his feet now too , grimacing . Her knee came up , stopped just short of his crotch . " No , " she said , her voice spiked with spite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turd . You drugged him , did n't you ? And set him up for this gangbang ? " Her arm swept the circle of chagrined partiers still fumbling their clothes on . He shrugged , making odd faces , like a kid caught cheating at Square/Cubes . I pulled my shirt on with stiff , clumsy fingers . I could n't see my jacket anywhere . I kept my eyes on the floor , because there were so many other eyes looking at me that would n't go away , so many minds ... . " Come on , " Argentyne said to me . The odd gentleness was back in her voice . She took my arm again , making me move forward . I saw Jiro then ; he had n't kept his back turned for long . I could n't make sense out of what flashed into his mind as he looked at me . Maybe he could n't , either . I looked down again . Argentyne caught his arm with it her other hand , steering us both toward the entrance . " Daric ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dance floor , toward the door . He moved slowly but inevitably , as if she held him too , dragging him along on an invisible chain of will . My head began to clear out just a little as we left the club . Putting the physical barrier of the walls between me and the eyes and the ! 1 minds made it easier . I took in long swallows of cold night air , tasting smoke and dankness . The mod that had brought us here came down from wherever it had been waiting overhead , homing in on Daric . It settled onto the street , scattering the ground traffic . The doors popped . I stood staring at it , starting to shiver inside my thin , syrup-soaked shirt . Trying to decide what to do . . . trying not to wait until somebody else told me . Argentyne turned away as Daric came out into the street and the gatekeeper slammed the door behind him . She was back in leather again , this time head to foot , solid and heavy like a trooper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually feel , if I touched her . . . see , if I touched her mind . . . . Desperately I tied up my thoughts , and  | this time it held . Relief hit me so hard it felt like an electric shock as I realized I was getting some kind of control over the psi again .. . relief , and disbelief . And then the betrayal and the fury , riding each others ' hacks as I turned toward Dario . But Argentyne was there first , the mask of control she 'd worn inside the club gone , the anger naked on her face . " You bastard , " she said , and the words trembled . " You scumbag , how could you pull a piece of shit like that in my place ? How could you do it to me ? How could you do it to him ? " waving a hand at Jiro , " ? or him ? " Pointing at me . Jiro stood as silent as stone behind me . People swirled past and around us , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do these lousy ? " She broke off . There were tears in her eyes . " Why do I let you do it to me .... " Her hands jerked , as if they wanted to beat on him . And trapped behind the transparent window of her anger there was the kind of pain that only grew out of one emotion ... . Dario stood without resisting , his mind full of the same twisted pain , letting her bury him in garbage , hating/loving it/her/himself ... . " I 'm sorry , " he said at last , when she 'd run out of things to call him , and the energy to spit out the words . " I 'm sorry .... " He said it again , as humbly as if she was the taMing , and he was no better than the burnout still face-down in the gutter behind us . " Go home . Go back where you belong . " She waved him gone , turning her back on him . " Stop fucking up my life .... " without even the strength @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facing me again . She pushed her hair back from her eyes , studying me until I had trouble meeting her stare . " You okay ? " she said , finally . She was worried about me filing a complaint . . . she was worried about me . I felt the corners of my mouth twitch , like a spasm . " My brains are n't hanging out any more . . . . So , yeah . " I shrugged , nodded . " Sex never killed me before . I guess I 'll live . " She half smiled . " Forthright , " she said . " You seem to know this territory by heart . " She touched my chest , let her hand drop . " Will you get these lost babes back where they belong ? Since you 're the only one who really knows where that is . " She glanced at Dario , Jiro . I nodded ; felt a smile of my own start , in spite of myself . She began to turn away . But it was only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . And then suddenly she was facing me again , and her arms were reaching out to pull me against her . She kissed me , long and hard , her nails digging into my back . She let me go and  | pushed away ; stood looking at me again , her open lips smiling , her eyes hot . " Now you know why I had to throw you out of there . " She nodded toward the club , and took a deep breath . " If that helps , remember it . " She went to Jiro , kneeled down beside him , gave him a hug . He stayed rigid and silent in her arms . " Oh , baby , " she said , looking away . " Sometimes life 's a bitter drug . If you have to take it , it 's better if you get it from somebody who cares about you . . . . You dance great . Go on , now . " She nudged him toward the mod . He got in , as numbly obedient as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again , grazing my thigh with a warm hip ; passed Daric , who was looking at her , at me . " It 's your fault , " she said to him . His eyes followed her like a dog . The door to Purgatory swung open as she started down the steps , and slammed shut again behind her . I waited while Daric 's eyes tracked back to me . I was ready to smash his face if there 'd been anything behind them that even reminded me of laughter . But his mind was the color of the streets , of need and anger and desperation . I turned my back on him too , and got into the mod . After a long minute he climbed in , and ordered the mod to take us back uptown . Jiro sat squeezed down into a corner , as far from either of us as he could get . I stared at my feet , not wanting to watch as the mod lifted from the ground . My hand hurt . I looked at it . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black stain of drying blood where Daric 's teeth had gone through my flesh . I focused my mind on stopping the pain , to keep from thinking about how it had gotten that way . Daric was looking at the wound too when I glanced up at him , the way a starving man would look at a half-eaten piece of meat . Only it was n't causing pain that he still wanted . It was feeling it . . . . In the moment after Argentyne had left him , there 'd been something I could relate to going on inside his brain . It was gone now . " You got any diseases I ought to know about ? " His mouth twisted . His eyes were empty as he looked away , out the window . I sighed , letting my head fall back against the seat . " Why did she kiss you like that ? " Jiro asked me . His voice was tiny , accusing . Me , like she meant it . Me , not Daric . Me , not him . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Daric . " I lifted my aching hand , pointed it at his stepbrother . He did n't ask . He only squeezed deeper into his corner , trying to get away from the ugliness and confusion in his own head , the images that looking at us only made clearer . And Daric did n't answer . If he had any regrets about what he 'd done to either of us , they had n't occurred to him yet . I started to reach out to Jiro with my mind , knowing that he needed help , and that no words could help him . But even as I did , I knew I was n't up to it . That if I tried to help him now , he 'd know it . I pulled back into my own disgust and exhaustion , and left him alone . And suddenly I remembered where we were going to be again in another few minutes . I tried not to wonder who was going to end up getting blamed for everything when we got there . I FOLLOWED DARIC back through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't wake up from a bad dream . Elnear 's party was still going on , but by now it had shrunk to just one room . Daric ducked in through the first doorway that opened onto light and noise , leaving me behind with Jiro as he lost himself in the crowd . I stared after him , not sure whether relief or envy was winning out in me as I watched him slide back into his other skin with smiling ease . Jiro stood shuffling his feet , not wanting to be left standing beside me , but filled with sudden panic as he thought about facing his family . . . his stepfather .  | " Go on in , " I said softly . I reached out , put my arm around him . " You did n't do anything wrong . " You did n't Repeating the same thing to myself , for the hundredth time . He did n't believe it , any more than I did . He jerked away from my hand and ran into the crowded room without looking back . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going in than he was , as I remembered what had happened this afternoon . To me it seemed like about a million years ago , by now ; but it probably did n't seem that long to the people in there . I let my mind search the crowd , searching for hypers , or for Elnear . Somehow I had the feeling she 'd still be there . She might be a lot of things , but she was n't a coward . I wondered what her evening had been like while I was gone ; if it had really been as bad as mine , and what that would mean when she saw me again . My eyes followed my thoughts restlessly , taking in the scene . The shifting mass of bodies stunned me with its normalness . There were a few exotics , wearing feathers for hair or calico skin , but it could have been makeup , costuming , for all I could tell . There was nobody who looked like they 'd be caught dead wearing their guts out in the open . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could have been in there , having a painless good time , having the best night of my stupid life . I should have been there I wondered what I would have had to say to anybody if I had ... . Probably just the wrong thing . I sagged back against the wall again , safe , out of sight , and suddenly too tired to move . Those were the elite of this world and dozens of others , in there  --  the richest , the most powerful , the most successful . They did n't need to wear their specialness on the outside , forcing the world to blink when it looked at them , to notice them , to acknowledge they were alive . Their only problem was convincing each other that they were still human , when half their head was full of bioware . . . when half of their souls were dead . Or all of their brain . My own brain stumbled as it hit a mind as empty as a broken eggshell . My sight homed in , and I stared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the crowd with a drink in one hand . He moved through the same aimless circulation patterns as anybody else , making programmed responses when they needed to be made , circling . . . . Why ? I pushed deeper into the blankness where a mind should have been . I did n't have to be careful ; he could n't feel me . The organ was intact , the wrinkled gray container of flesh that should have held all the complicated magic that made him  | a sentient being . But it was n't anything now except a piece of meat . Something was in there , keeping his vital signs up , making him respond . .. . Programmed . That was it . What was imitating a mind was nothing but somebody 's biosoft . I felt my stomach turn over . Elnear . Where the hell was she ? Suddenly I was sure she was still in the room , that he was waiting for the crowd to thin out a little more , for some perfect moment  --  I found her , standing on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conversation she did n't care about with a person she did n't know . Her arms were folded , her large-knuckled hands clutching her elbows ; but otherwise you could n't tell that she was enjoying this about as much as standing on a bed of broken glass . I started into the room , keeping a fix on her mind as I pushed my way toward her . It was like working the night crowds back in Oldcity . . . . Some half-buried itch could n't help signaling me that I could steal half the people in this room blind , and they 'd never know what happened Two sets of hands suddenly locked over my arms . A man and a woman I 'd never seen before , with bland , too-perfect faces , were smiling at me . " How good to see you . " " So glad you could come ... " The pressure on my arms suddenly increased until if I did n't stop moving something would snap . I stopped . Looking at them , groping . . . They were Corpses . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I realized they were Elnear 's Security people , the ones she 'd warned me about . They knew I 'd know what they were , that I 'd hear the message behind the meaningless words . " Listen , " I said , " I have to tell ? " " ? Look at his hand , Adson , poor fellow , whatever did you do to yourself come on sweetheart we 'll fix it right up ... " ( Do n't make a scene , you little bastard , just come on ? ) They turned me around in my tracks and started me back toward the door . Suddenly I saw Lazuli . She saw me too : I got a sudden flash of how I looked from across the room , my coat gone , my shirt fastened crooked and hanging out of my pants . I opened my mouth . " Where 's ? " The pressure on my arms got so bad , so fast , that I had to clench my teeth to keep from crying out . ( Take me to Braedee or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands loosened as if I was red-hot . " I need to see him , " I said to them , trying to keep my voice down as Lazuli came toward us . " It 's important . It 's about Lady Elnear. "  | Lazuli was searching the crowd , frowning with concern , but it was n't about me . " Cat , have you seen Jiro ? " she said . " I have n't seen him since ? " " We 'll take you to Braedee , " the man muttered , his voice grating , urging me forward again . " Come on . " " Jiro 's all right , " I called back over my shoulder . " I 'll explain later . " Not knowing how , or when , or what in hell I was going to tell her . Braedee was waiting for us , out in the darkened hallway beyond the door . " Braedee , you 've got to ? " " What now ? " His mouth pulled up in the usual sardonic smile . " First you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you away from the Lady ? " The two ChemEnGen Corpses on either side of me were watching him the way you 'd watch a snake . " Lady Elnear 's orders were to keep him away from her tonight , " the woman said grimly . " No one told me that . " Braedee 's eyes never seemed to move from their faces , but suddenly he was looking at me . " Who did that to your hand ? " " I bit myself , eating . Shut up and listen to me , damn you . There 's somebody in that room who does n't belong there . He 's brain-dead ? " Braedee 's laughter rattled up and down the hall . " Almost everybody in that room is brain-dead . It 's hardly a secret . " " I mean literally , goddamn it ! He 's a total burnout running on somebody else 's ' ware . There 's nobody in there . " I brushed my head with my hand . " I think maybe he 's after the Lady . " Braedee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reject the whole idea . But then he said , " Show him to me . " Elnear 's Security people went rigid , as if they were ready to use their own bodies to stop us . " He 's not going back in there . We have orders ? " " He works for me , " Braedee said . " And you do n't . This is my system , and it covers everyone on these grounds equally . " Suddenly there were two more Corpses , wearing Centauri colors , standing in the hall shadows behind him . " You are in my way . " My arms were free . The two Chem Corpses did n't move as I turned around . I did n't wait for Braedee to step on my heels before I was on my way back down the hall . I stood in the doorway , scanning with my mind  --  found Elnear , a lot closer to us now . She was standing  | with Dane and Lazuli . I veered away , not wanting to know what he was telling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There . " I pointed . The burnout was across the room but angling toward her , still smiling , still empty . My mind cringed . " Get him out of here . Stop him . He 's trouble ? " Braedee watched the stranger , with God-knew-what going on in the systems behind his eyes . " He 's a legitimate guest . There is absolutely nothing that could injure anyone concealed anywhere on or inside his body . He 's drinking something harmless . " He glanced at me . " You 've had too much to drink . For God 's sake , tuck in your shirt . " He began to turn away . " Braedee ? " I caught his arm . He jerked free . " Do n't ever do that again , " he murmured , smoothing his sleeve . And then he was walking away . I swore , and went back into the room , going after Elnear . Daric saw me coming , this time , and nudged her arm . She did n't see him smile as she turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked up with her . I felt Elnear subvocalize a call to her Security people as she spotted me wading toward her . Her frown deepened as they did n't appear . " Lady ? " I gasped it out as I got close enough for her to hear without me having to shout it . " Please , ma'am ? " Not daring to touch her mind , knowing how she 'd react . I saw the walking vegetable stop , a few meters behind her , and smile his empty smile at me . He looked back at her , taking an awkward gulp of his drink . She was calling Jardan now , as she realized the guards were n't coming . Something that was n't quite frustration and was n't quite panic began to wind like a spring inside her . She took in my syrupstained clothes in one quick glance , hating the sight of me . " Mez Cat ? " Her voice was perfectly calm , and cold . " What are you doing here ? " " Ma'am , I think you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Please , will you please just come with me ? " I reached out for her hand . " Where is my Security ? " She stiffened , her hands clenching at her sides . " What are you doing here ? " " Probably wants to tell you all about his evening in Purgatory . " Daric leered . " I was just telling them what a good sport you were . " I felt my face flush . " Shut up , you slad . " Lazuli was frown- ing now . Heads were turning ; I half heard the whispers starting . " Lady , I 'll explain anything you want if you just come with me . " I caught her arm , tugging her forward . " No trouble , I swear " 1 saw Jardan push past the burnout , coming toward us . He almost spilled his drink ; finished it in a desperate gulp , his eyes riveted on us . The drink . He started forward as he saw us begin to move . . . . The drink . ( Get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , knocking her into Daric and Lazuli , knocking all of them flat . I landed on top of them in a tangle of hard elbows and knees , just as the stranger exploded . The shock of the blast punched into my eardrums like an icepick . More bodies crashed down on top of me , crushing the air out of my lungs . I lay there for a long time , trying to breathe , trying to tell whether the pain I felt everywhere was inside me or outside ; if any of the groans and screams were mine , if the wetness dripping into my eye was really my own blood . Everything was in slow motion : sounds , movement , all sensation with it , as if I 'd been hit by a tidal wave and drowned ... . Someone was picking bodies off of me . Someone was hauling me up like a body . I blinked my eyes clear . There were uniforms everywhere , Centauri logos , blood . A hand slid down my shoulder : it was n't attached to anything . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a red puddle . I saw Lazuli , heard her screaming , over and over ; saw Dane , silent and dazed , and Elnear , her eyes closed . . . . My head was so full of shock and pain and horror that I could n't hold it all . Suddenly Braedee was in front of me , blocking out my vision , his hand lifting my chin . " Can you hear me ? " " No , " I mumbled , scratching at my ear . I was ready to start screaming too , as I tried to find the strength to close down my mind , shut out the terrible noise . . . . He leaned close to my face . " Damn it , boy ! How did you know ? ? " I swore , shaking my head . " Told you . I told you . . . . " It was all the answer I could get out . And all the answer he deserved . THE HUMAN BOMB had killed three people . Elnear was n't one of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; about twenty more people were transferred to the med center . I was one of them , although cleaning me up was the worst part of what they had to do to me there . They scanned me and picked some bone shrapnel out of my shoulder , then let me go . I was bruised and half-deaf , but otherwise there was nothing wrong with me that would n't be wrong with anyone who 'd just had somebody else 's guts scraped off of him . I finally let my eyes clear when they told me I could leave the examining room . I put on the clean clothes that had appeared out of nowhere , and walked out through the doorway ; bumped into the jamb , and stopped . I knew that I was in a hospital , and that it had to be a good one , considering the clientele . But it could have been a suite in the best hotel in N'yuk that I 'd walked into : a cool green room that was all softness and peace , thick rugs on the floor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no cold antiseptic halls , no ceramics , no noise : no evidence that anybody ever felt pain , or needed help . It stank of total unreality . But it could n't keep the handful of people sitting together on the modular couch from looking like survivors huddled together in a lifeboat . None of them were wearing what they 'd worn an hour ago . I saw Lazuli , sitting with her arms around Jiro , her face too white and calm , as if she was tranked on the same sedatives they 'd tried to  | give me . I 'd had enough drugs for one night . I ) aric sat across from her , sitting on the edge of his seat like he had a stick up his ass . His mouth pinched as he saw me , but this time he kept it shut . Everyone sitting in the circle was a taMing . There were two others that I recognized ; one of them was Charon . There were no outsiders  --  except me . And Braedee . He was standing in the center @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Or maybe answering them . I could n't hear what he was saying . I would n't let myself feel what they were feeling ; not yet . I was still too close to the edge . I 'd managed to build the mental shield , strand by strand , that put silence between me and the agony all around me . I was afraid to let it down again . I stood where I was , half wondering whether I was n't here by mistake , as more heads began to turn . But Braedee gestured me toward them , said something impatient-sounding that I could n't make out . I went over and sat down in the circle of taMings , feeling all their eyes fixed on me . They all had to know who and what I was now ; but I still was n't sure what that meant . I looked up at them , down again , wetting my lips . " Thank you , " Lazuli said quietly . I glanced at her . She smiled , ruffling Jiro 's spikey hair with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stared at me , his eyes dark . Other faces smiled , other voices echoed her thanks around the circle . Charon taMing did n't say anything , and there was no crack in the cold wall of his face . I glanced at Daric . His face was frozen too , a warped mirror of his father 's . " You 're welcome , " I said , still meeting his stare . His gaze broke suddenly and he looked away . I almost thought he was ashamed , but maybe it was my imagination . " Where 's Elnear ? " I realized suddenly that I 'd forgotten to say " the Lady . " But for once no one frowned . Maybe saving her life had given me the right to forget , for once . " Is she all right ? " Braedee sat down on the couch an arm 's length away from me . He nodded . " Thanks to your . . . loyalty . " The catch was back in his voice , the way I 'd heard it the first time I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say it . His finger traced the curve of his brow around the edge of his eye . It was the closest to a case of nerves I 'd ever seen in him . I wondered if he 'd rather have seen more people die than be proved wrong by me . I wondered what he 'd told the taMings  --  if he 'd told them how he had n't listened to me . I did n't say anything . " She 's with Philipa , " Lazuli said .  | I looked up , suddenly remembering that Jardan had been passing the stranger just as he finished his drink . Lazuli nodded , reading the question in my eyes . " She was .. . badly injured . " She took a breath , getting her voice under control . " They say . . . that they do n't know .... " Her voice trailed . She blinked , like something hurt behind her eyes . I grimaced . I glanced at Braedee again . His lips thinned . " Can I speak to her ? Elnear  --  Lady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .. . something . " Braedee frowned , and Charon taMing said , " I have questions about what happened tonight that I want you to answer before you go anywhere . " His voice was as cold as his eyes . I shook my head , looking at him . " Not tonight , " I said , and I did n't look down . I stood up , slowly because I was getting stiff . " I 'm too goddamn tired . I just want to see the Lady , and then I want to sleep . Ask me tomorrow . " He stiffened . I saw real emotion on his face for the first time . It looked like disbelief . Before he could say anything , Lazuli said , " Of course , Cat . I 'll take you to her . And then ... " she glanced at Charon , back at me , " perhaps you would be kind enough to see us home to the estates ? " She got to her feet , nudging Jiro up . I blinked , feeling a sudden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Lazuli . " Charon reached out , catching hold of her arm . " We are staying at the townhouse tonight . " She went even paler , but then her color came back in a rush . " No , " she said . " You can pretend it did n't happen if you want to . Not me . Not Jiro . " She jerked her hand free , and crossed to my side . Jiro followed her , glancing nervously over his shoulder . Charon half rose from his seat ; settled back again under the weight of too many watching eyes . " Very well . I will see you tomorrow , then . " His own gaze flicked from her to me , back again . Lazuli lifted her head , still defiant . Her hand slipped around my arm . I saw Charon 's eyes fix on it , and wished she had n't done that . But there was nothing I could do about it now except follow her out of the room . Elnear was sitting alone in another room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was , and she was waiting , her face heavy with grief and shock and exhaustion . . . all the things I would n't let myself read in her mind . Behind her was a wide stretch of dark glass . At first I thought it was a mirror . It was n't . It looked down into  | a surgery . She could watch , it ' she needed to ; but right now this was as close to Philipa as she could get . " Elnear ? " Lazuli said softly , as she started across the room . Elnear looked up at us , the dazed suffering fading from her eyes . She rose to her feet , a little unsteady , and held out her arms to Lazuli and Jiro . She held them close , before she pulled them down beside her . I hung back , feeling like an intruder , as her eyes found me again . They were red-rimmed , but there were no tears in them now . They were a clear , steady blue as she looked at me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to wish I had n't come . And then she lifted her hand from her lap , holding it out to me . I crossed the room , stopped in front of her , uncertain . Slowly I took her hand , and she put her other hand on top of mine , making me sit down beside her on the cushioned seat . " I feel ... " she said at last , and broke off , as if for once she was having trouble finding the right words . " I feel as if I owe you such a debt that to thank you , or even to apologize to you , can only be so meaningless that it would be insulting ... . " She looked down at my hand , up at my face again . " But thank you for what you did . Thank God you are all right . And I am so terribly sorry , Cat .... " I looked away , choking on the crazy laughter that suddenly filled me up . I tried to stop it , but it burst out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sounded more like a pain cry . I pressed my hand over my mouth , taking a deep breath , and another , until I was sure I could keep a straight face when I looked back at her again . They were all looking at me , but no one looked like I 'd done anything strange . Maybe after what had happened to us all , anything we did seemed normal . I glanced up at the window behind me , careful not to focus because I might see what was happening on the other side of it . " I 'm sorry too , ma'am . About . . . " I nodded my head at the window , " Philipa . " It sounded about as meaningless and empty as what she 'd just said to me . But even that was almost a relief , somehow . She nodded , her eyes dimming again as she remembered what was being done in there . " They have the best of everything here , Elnear , " Lazuli said , touching her shoulder . " There 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do whatever is necessary for her . " " Yes , I know . " Elnear sighed . Her hands were back in her own lap again , clenched together . " Wo n't you come back to the estates with us ? "  | She shook her head . No . I 'll he fine here . In not going anywhere until I 'm sure that . . . that everything will be all right . " Lazuli nodded , getting slowly to her feet . She glanced at me as Jim stood up beside her . I stood up too , waited until they were halfway toward the door . I looked at Elnear . " Ma'am . . . I told you the truth before . I 've never lied to you about anything . And the other things Stryger claimed , about things I did back in Oldcity  --  I did them to stay alive . That 's all . " I turned away and followed Lazuli out of the room . Not knowing , not really caring , whether the words meant any more to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even remember that I said them . At least I 'd know I said them . As I followed Lazuli and Jiro back through the med center 's halls , I began to realize that everyone I saw wore either a Centauri logo , or a Centauri security clearance . " Do you own this hospital too ? " I said finally . Lazuli had n't said anything , or even looked at me , while we walked . Now she glanced at me , distracted by my voice  --  glad of the distraction . " It must look that way . " She laughed , a little too sharply , still teetering on the brink of something darker . " Centauri contributed a great deal to the construction of this wing . In return , we retain certain facilities on long term lease for our private use . " " The taMing Wing ? " I said , and laughed . A little color came into her cheeks , a smile touched her lips . " A number of the larger combines do the same thing . It 's more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words fading . She slowed her footsteps until she was walking beside me . She held Jiro 's hand tightly in hers , and he did n't complain . We took the lift up to the garage level . A few more steps across a silent space to a mod and I could let my whole body drop into autopilot . The day would finally be finished with me . The doors slipped open . The first thing I saw was Daric . He was surrounded . A dozen hypers were swarming over him like flies on garbage . " Jeezu ! " I whispered . " Who let them in here ? " " It 's a public access ? " Lazuli looked left and right , her face pinching as she searched for a way around them . " Get away from me . I do n't know anything about it ! " Daric waved his hands , twitching with irritation . " Ask him . " He turned , pointing at us , at me . " He 's the one you want to talk to . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ran , as the hypers turned to see what he meant .  | And then they were all over us , trapping us against the wall , shoving hands that were cameras and spotlights , and faces with three eyes into my face Suddenly the nearest hypers were stumbling back like something had sprayed them with bug killer ; suddenly their echoing voices sounded like they were coming at us from the other side of a wall . We were shielded . " Cat , " Lazuli murmured , " you do n't have to speak to them now . We 're still inside Centauri 's security system . " I 'd covered my face with my arm , ready to cut and run like Daric had if I needed to . But then I began to hear what the hypers were trying to ask me . It was n't about this afternoon . . . it was about tonight . Slowly I lowered my arm . Shander Mandragora himself was planted right in front of me ; I could see him subvocalizing to his audience . " It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let it down . I want to talk to them . " The sudden rush of adrenaline that had hit me when I saw the hypers was making me feel brave and alert . She did n't look happy , but suddenly the voices were rattling in our ears again as the hypers surged forward . " . . . Lady Elnear Lyron/taMing 's controversial young psion aide , " Shander Mandragora said , suddenly coming on audio as he elbowed somebody out of his way . " You 're quite a hero . " He smiled at me , cool , confident , and looking earnest as hell . He was wearing padded body armor . So were the rest of the hypers . I wondered if it was to protect them from each other , or from their victims . " Tell us how you managed to save the Lady and several other members of the taMing family from a human time bomb . " He was gazing right into my eyes , and his own eyes were the color of sapphires . He was standing so close to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just as good as he did on the threedy  --  lean , square-jawed , tough . I remembered having a dream about being him once , while I was asleep on a moldy mat in the back room of an abandoned building . " Did you use your mind ? " I felt the crazy laughter try to get loose inside me again . I swallowed it , along with half a dozen wiseass answers . I could n't help staring at the camera lens in the middle of his forehead . It looked like a paste-on jewel , the same color as his eyes ; but once you knew that it was n't , it was hard to look away from . Kind of like the muzzle of a gun . " Well , I . . . " My throat suddenly went dry with the fear of saying the wrong thing , and I had to swallow again . " Yeah . I used my . . . my Gift . " Trying not to sound like I was embarrassed to  | admit it . " I picked up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his head . He was n't . . . human any more , he was a machine . I knew I had to warn the Lady . I was almost too late . " " What made you read the guests ' minds tonight ? " Mandragora asked , blinking as if he suddenly wondered what I was doing now . " Are you always on ' ? " " No . " I shook my head , tried to smile away the look on his face . " It 's hard work . I was just doing my job . Checking out the crowd to make sure they were all right . It 's part of what I was hired to do . " " You mean you were hired by Lady Elnear as a personal spy ? " Someone 's open hand flashed in front of Mandragora 's face ; a camera eye stared at me from its palm . Some combine logo I did n't recognize was tattooed above it . " No ? " I bit off the curse that wanted to follow , wondering if the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spy for Centauri ? ? " This hyper had on Triple Gee colors . " I was hired to protect her ! Because somebody 's been trying to kill her . Like they almost did tonight . " " Why did n't the Lady Elnear tell us about that in her rebuttal ? ? " Shander Mandragora was back in my face again , and somebody was groaning in the background . I shrugged , feeling my frown get deeper . " Maybe she did n't feel like discussing it with the whole galaxy . " " Lady Elnear ? " Lazuli said , very loudly , very clearly , " did n't want the people watching to feel that she was using a personal problem to gain their support . She felt that her arguments had to be strong enough to stand on their own . " I smiled , grateful , as the cameras , and the heat , turned away from me toward her . " Lady Lazuli taMing , " Mandragora said , acknowledging and identifying her from an augmented memory bank . " Another survivor of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would want to kill Lady Elnear ? " " No . " Lazuli shook her head . " No idea at all . " I felt her falter behind the skin-deep mask of a board member 's arrogance . " How is Lady Elnear ? Why has n't she come out yet ? " someone shouted . Mandragora was losing ground . " She 's fine , perfectly fine ! " Lazuli had to raise her voice again to make them listen . " A personal friend was seriously injured . The Lady is waiting for news about her condition . "  | " Why did n't you save everybody ' ? " Somebody eke jarred me back against the wall . " Why did n't you bring in Security ' ? " Whose logo was it ? I could n't even see . " I did  --  did n't have time . " Not sure why I was covering for Braedee . " Why did n't you stop him yourself ? Why did you let those other people die ? You could have stopped him with your mind . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just a telepath , that 's all . Not even a very good one . I 'm not God . I 'm not a Corpse , either . " " But you are a criminal . Why did Lady Elnear hire a traitor who worked for a psion terrorist ? Why are you free ? Sojourner Stryger called you ? " " I know what he called me . " I shoved the camera away , and three more replaced it . " He 's a liar ! " I twisted until I could see Shander Mandragora and he could see me . " You let Stryger smear the Lady today ! " I yelled . He 'd done it . . . he could fix it . " Jeezu , I do n't believe this  --  I did n't work for Quicksilver . I killed him ! Does n't anybody here know that ? How the hell can you know all about me and not know that ? " " Do you mean you were a part of his terrorist group , and you betrayed him to the FTA ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ killed him in self-defense goddamn it ! And to save my friends , and to save your stinking telhassium . I was n't a traitor , I worked for the FTA . You 've got a head full of history , why the hell do n't you 11 ' use it ? We were fucking psion heroes . For about as long as it took to say our names . . . just like tonight . But I missed it all , because I had a nervous breakdown after I killed him . That 's what it means to be a telepath , and kill somebody . . . . " I had to stop , taking a deep breath in the sudden silence . " And I guess it still does n't mean shit to be a psion and a hero . " By the time the questions started again , it was too late . I was fi halfway to the waiting mod . Lazuli and Jiro followed behind me . The mod sealed us in , out of reach , and took us away at Lazuli 's order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " Lady Lazuli , I have detected five intrusive listening devices in the clothing of the passengers . " " Deactivate them , " she said , her voice still perfectly calm . I almost thought I felt the scramble burst that burned them out . Lazuli waited until the voice reported , " Clear . " Then she slumped back into the formfoam of the seat , and covered her face with her hands . After a moment her hands slid down again , dropped limply into her lap . " They bugged us ? " I said , incredulous .  | She nodded . I saw tears shining on her face in the brief light of a passing streetlamp . Jiro looked up at her , and his mouth began to tremble as he saw his mother crying . Suddenly tears were running down his cheeks . He hid his face against her as he cried . I swallowed hard , keeping my mind clenched , afraid that in a minute it was going to be three of us . " I 'm sorry , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her to show the hypers that proud , cool face ; to protect me , and Elnear , the way she had . " I did n't know they 'd ... " My hands made fists ; let go again , too tired to hold onto the anger . My whole body ached , my nerves felt raw . I wished I 'd taken everything they 'd offered me at the med center . " It 's all right , " she lied . " I 'm quite used to them . " She sat up straighter , wiped at her eyes . " It was just the final . . . the last thing , that was too much . They had no right to do that to you , to Elnear through you . . . no right ! " She blew her nose . " But it 's all they know how to do ? " " I knew the combine hypers were all liars , " I said , rolling the sour words on my tongue . " I just did n't know the Indy 's hypers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jiro lifted his face from her shoulder to stare at me , as if hearing someone talk to his mother that way was more than he could believe . " ' Scuse me , ma'am . " I looked out the window at the one large moon rising , the dark world down below ; for a heartbeat remembering somewhere else . " Do n't apologize , " she said . " I find it refreshing . " She frowned then , thinking about something else . " Our own media people should have been on this , and given them the true story by now . I do n't understand why they did n't seem to know the truth . " I glanced back at her , realizing that she knew what everyone else knew about me , now  --  the truth , and even the lies  --  but it had n't seemed to make any difference to her . " Ma'am , " not using her name , because Jiro was still looking at me that way , " did Braedee say anything at the hospital tonight about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shook her head . " Nobody asked him ? " " Great-uncle Hwang did , " Jiro volunteered . " Charon said forget it . He said it did n't matter , it just made everything perfect . " " Perfect ? " I frowned , wondering what in hell he 'd meant by that . I was too tired to try to figure it out . " I 'm not a traitor , " I said .  | Lazuli looked at me , her lace calm in the wash of moonlight . " I never thought you were . " " Why not ? " She glanced down suddenly , and shrugged . " You do n't act like one . " That did n't make any sense either , but I did n't push it . Instead I asked , " What did Daric tell you and the Lady ? " She looked surprised , as if I 'd asked something totally pointless . " He said he took you and Jiro to hear Argentyne perform . He said that you seemed to enjoy the show more than Jiro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take Jiro anywhere again without telling me first . " Her arm curved around him protectively . I glanced at Jiro , glad we were all in darkness just then . " I 'm never going anywhere with Daric again , " Jiro said , his voice hard with anger and betrayal . His eyes kept touching me and jerking away , coming back to my face again . " Why ? " Lazuli asked . " He 's a croach , " Jiro said . Her fingers moved in a short , silent question . He shook his head . She looked back at me again . My stomach tightened as I waited for her to ask me what had really happened . But she did n't ask . Nobody said anything more . When we finally reached the estates , I helped Lazuli steer Jiro to his room . I waited while she put him to bed , letting the doorway hold me up , too exhausted to bother moving . But as she waved the lights down and came out into the hall , I heard Jiro call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nodded . I went into the room . " Cat ... ? " Jiro said , his voice thick with sleep . " Yeah , I 'm here . " As my eyes adjusted , I could see his face clearly in the dim wash of light from the hall . He could n't see mine . " You probably think I 'm real stupid , do n't you ? " he said . " No . " I half smiled . " Just real lucky . I guess nobody 's luck lasts forever . " " You saved Aunt Elnear , just like you promised . And you saved my mother too ? " His voice blurred with feeling , his eyes got wet again . " I 'll give you anything you want . I have stuff like you 've never seen ? " I did n't say anything . I turned away , starting back across the room . " Cat ? ? " I stopped .  | " I was scared of you tonight . I hated you , too . " " I know . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smile , this time . " That 's all I want . " Out in the hall Lazuli looked at me , curious . " He just wanted to say thanks . " She nodded , hesitated . . . reached out and put her hand on my arm . " Cat ... " " You already have . Good night , ma'am . " I went back along the hall , before it was too late . I stumbled up the stairs to my own room and fell into bed , hardly stopping long enough to peel off my clothes . I could n't sleep . I lay there , feeling the seconds pass like water dripping ; feeling every centimeter of my spreadeagled body twitch and crawl and shiver like a plucked string . Closing my eyes only made me see things I 'd never wanted to see in the first place . Opening them again , in the empty bed in the empty room , only reminded me of how alone I was . And then my door opened softly , and someone stepped inside . Caught in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... Jule . A tiny spark of light caught fire in the palm of her hand , guiding her across the uncertain darkness to me . " Lazuli . . . " I pushed myself up , feeling the covers slide down over the sudoskin bandaging my shoulder . You should n't be here do n't do this to me I want you . . . . Afraid to speak , because I did n't know what would come out of my mouth first . She set the lamp chip on the table beside the bed , stood gazing down at me . Her night-black hair fell free over her shoulders , her skin was like amber in the lampglow . She reached up , began to unfasten the pearls that buttoned the neckline of her restless gown . " Wait ? " I whispered , my throat tight . Her fingers froze ; her eyes clung to me . " What about  --  Charon . " I looked down , not sure who I was more afraid for , her or me . " If anybody finds out ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . " she said , and her voice trembled . " Please do n't make me beg you . I need someone . I do n't want to be alone tonight .... " I raised my hand ; she caught it , kissed it , settling onto the bed . Dizzy with disbelief , I let go the clenched fist that my mind had been since the explosion , letting it fill with her thoughts , her emotions . She 'd almost died tonight . . . . But she was alive , so alive that every nerve in her body sang with need . Nothing mattered tonight , not Charon ,  | not tomorrow , not who she was or even what I was . She needed to feel loved , and that was all she knew . She wanted me to love her , me and no one else , because she 'd known when I looked at her how much I wanted it too ... . I pulled her down beside me with unsteady hands , feeling her hair brush my cheek as I found her mouth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to meet her eyes . Burning with the hunger in my blood ... not knowing what to do next . I 'd been naked in bed with strangers before , for nearly half a lifetime ; but all there had ever been between us was money . Nameless , faceless , we 'd done what we had to do , with no real emotion and no expectations . I 'd never had a woman like this  --  this beautiful , this untouchable  --  not in my wildest fantasies . One who really wanted me . . . . One who had a right to expect things that maybe I did n't know how to give . The fear that I did n't know how to be what she wanted suddenly seemed like the worst fear I 'd ever known . But she took my hand as gently as if she thought I was a virgin , and laid it on her breast . I fumbled with the buttons of her gown , awkward and uncertain as I finished what she 'd started . The gown seemed to melt away under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own , the silken cloth becoming her flesh , warm and yielding . I shuddered with the electric shock of our contact as she pressed herself against my thighs ; rolled onto her , holding her there under me , her softness beneath my sudden painful hardness . It was too easy to go on then , after all that had happened tonight ... too easy . She clung to me , her mouth open , hungry for my kisses . Her lips were like flowers after the rain , I could have kissed them forever , lost inside the wet , warm contact , feeling her pleasure ... she had always wanted to be kissed this way , kissed and kissed endlessly ... feeding my own . Her hands explored me in slow , grazing circles , the white scars on my back , the smooth brown of my sides , my thighs . I slid off of her , my own restless hands covering her breasts , curving down along the gentle hills of her belly , into the warm , waiting valley between her legs . She moaned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guiding me deeper into her hidden places . I felt the murmur of her mind , as open and yearning as her body . I followed its whispering voice down , deeper and deeper , until I knew every sweet ache , every burning , dazzled second of her arousal . I 'd never made love to a woman while I 'd had my Gift  --  never known what it could do , how it doubled every ecstasy , her pleasure woven into mine until every place I touched her  | body brought heat as dizzying as her touch against my own . Suddenly I was n't afraid any more that I could n't give her what she wanted . Because I knew what she wanted .. . . My mouth left hers , traveling down over her throat , her shoulders , her breasts ... following her lead , granting her every unspoken wish with growing urgency . Her breath came in shallow sobs , she whimpered , and then began to tremble , as the realization grew in her mind of what was being done to her . Wonder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that had clung to me , caressed me , urged me , suddenly were trying to push me away . Gasping for breath I let her go , backing off , putting space between us for the length of heartbeats it took for the heat of her unfinished desire to burn away her fear . And then I began again . This time I took more care , not answering every need , or not too soon ; drawing it out , letting her feel that there were still secret places that she could keep hidden , if only in her mind . Soothing , lingering , exploring , until my mouth reached the place where she had ached for someone 's mouth to be And the rising wave of her pleasure reached its crest and broke over her , over me , through every synapse of my body , until it was all I could do to hold myself under control . I swung my hips over her again , down into the waiting space between her open thighs . I slid into her , deep into the final place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I began to move , feeling myself , feeling myself inside her , stunned with sensation . Her hips rose to meet my thrusts , while the tide rose inside me this time , rising and rising toward that impossible crest , and exploding over me , out of me , back along the filaments of contact I had woven and into her unprotected mind . I felt her come again , her climax recoiling through my own like a riptide , fusing us into one . I covered her mouth with mine to drown out her cry , and she kissed me and I kissed her , echoing echoing echoing , until there was nothing left of us but warm ashes . She held me inside the circle of her arms , I held her inside mine , and there were tears on my face , but I did n't know whose they were . Still clinging to each other while the darkness slowly faded into dawn , we slept . WHEN I WOKE UP again it was the middle of the morning , and my mind was still half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the warm band of sunlight to touch warm skin , reaching out with my mind . The bed was empty . My mind touched the mind of a total stranger . I pushed myself up , confused  --  jerked back as my eyes registered the pair of uniformed legs standing beside the bed . The Corpse looked down at me , expressionless , and said , " The Chief and Gentleman Charon want to talk to you about last night . " Lazuli ? I bit my tongue to keep from blurting out the question before I found the answer . No . She was nowhere in sight , nowhere in his mind . It was about the explosion , that was all . If the Corpse wondered why I looked so guilty , or why I looked so relieved , he did n't let it bother him . A one-track mind had its points . " Sure . Just give me a minute . " While I pulled on some clothes I wondered about why they 'd sent a body to deliver the message , instead of calling me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night . Or maybe they just wanted me paranoid . As I passed the bathroom mirror , a sudden flash of green caught my eye . I stopped , looking at myself , turning my head  --  saw the light wink again . My ear . I reached up , touching it , with a slow smile starting . There was an earring in my ear , one I 'd never seen before . Green glass , catching the light when I moved , like a cat 's eye . I knew  | I had n't put it there . . . I figured I knew who had . I stuck a drug patch behind my ear , and went out of the room . The first thing the Corpse did when I came downstairs was make me take the patch off . Braedee 's orders . It took about half an hour for the effects to wear off . By the time we reached the city , he wanted me deaf and dumb . The Corpse threw the patch away . I did n't bother to tell him about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He took me back into N'Yuk , to the taMing townhouse . You 'd never have known there 'd been three murders and a lot of blood there the night before . I followed the Corpse through the room where it had all happened , and everything in it was immaculate  --  walls , carpets , furniture . Some of the furniture looked different than I remembered , but otherwise it fit the room perfectly . It made my skin crawl . Braedee and Charon taMing were waiting for me in the room beyond , a space like a cell , which did n't make me feel much better . As I walked through the doorway I felt something not-human whisper across my brain and fade again . Then I understood . It was a whiteroom  --  so thick with security that my psi actually registered it . I stopped , uncertain , as Braedee stood up from the couch . Charon stayed where he was , deep in its folds , staring at me . I made myself look right at him , my face as stupidly expressionless as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd just slept with someone 's wife was something I did n't have a whole lot of practice at . " Why are you looking at me like that ? " he snapped . " Nothing , sir . " I glanced away from him , at Braedee , at the door . " Sit down , " Braedee said , and pointed at a chair . I followed his hand , glad to have somewhere else to look . But my mind was still focused on Charon , just as paranoid as he wanted it to be , for all the wrong reasons . But not deaf , or dumb . Inside the forest of his augmentation , I felt him daring me to sit in that chair . Somehow I managed not to turn back and stare at him . I kept looking at the chair , the one Braedee had pointed out . Soft , humpbacked , bluegray  --  there was nothing unusual about it . But whoever sat in it was going to get one hell of a shock , right where it hurt him most . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A trap . If my psi was really shut down the way he wanted it to be , then I 'd go to the chair and sit in it , and he 'd get to watch me jump . But if I could read him , I 'd know Braedee was looking at me again . I clamped down hard on my body functions , hoping I could keep the readings normal enough to  | suit him . Forcing myself to stay calm , forcing myself to move , I crossed the room . Without taking a deep breath , I sat down in the chair . They were n't bluffing . I leaped up again with a curse , as the current sank its teeth into my ass . " What the hell ? ? " I yelled , as if I did n't know . I did n't have to fake the anger that came with it . " Is that supposed to be some kind of fucking joke ? " I looked at Braedec and shook out my smarting hands . Braedee stood where he was , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do anything , which had to mean I 'd passed his test . Charon settled back into the couch , his body going loose as the suspicion flowed out of him ; satisfied , because Braedee was . " Not a joke , I assure you , " Braedee said mildly . " A test . " " Of what ? " I remembered to ask , still frowning . " Of whether you were reading us . " " Shit , " I said . " Maybe that 's where your brains are , " rubbing my butt , " but mine are up here . " I jerked my head at him . " Whose chair is that  --  Daric 's ? " His mouth twitched . " Sit down . . . I promise you , it wo n't happen again . " " You sit in it , " I said . He was telling the truth , but I did n't feel much like sitting down , anyway . He shrugged , and sat down in the chair . Nothing happened to him . " Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " I asked . " The Gentleman prefers it that way , " Braedee said , and glanced at Charon . I turned to look at him again . It was easier , this time . " I thought you were paying to keep me switched on . " I wondered if it was just his disgust at the thought of being touched by my mind , or if he really had something to hide . By the time I got out of this room , I was going to know which it was . His anger was like a wave of heat . " I 'm paying you to do what you 're told , " he said . " We will ask the questions . You answer them  --  civilly . " He shot a dark look at Braedee , one that said he thought Braedee was letting me get away with too much , letting me mouth off without stepping on me . I remembered what Braedee had done to me before the board meeting . He had n't let me get away with it then . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his career . He 'd finally stepped off the edge . I said , " Yes , sir , " anyway , because Charon was making a fist of his cybered hand . I did n't have to read his mind to know what he 'd  | like to do with it . Knowing what he owed me for saving his family and linear last night had n't changed how he felt about psions , except maybe to make him more bitter . I went to the couch and sat on it , because it was the only place left to sit down . I kept as much space between him and me as I could . Its soft folds were filled with something that shifted out of my way like water . I tried not to flounder . " What do you want to know ? Sir . " " You read the mind of that assassin last night , " he said . I nodded , even though it was n't a question . " And you saw something that gave him away to you , something that did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was it ? " I glanced at Braedee . He had n't told them . He was looking back at me , looking a little grim , but that was all . I slipped in through the hissing grids of his implants , waded too-clear streams of biosoft , treading as lightly as I could : He knew I had n't told anybody what he 'd done  --  or had n't done  --  last night . He was counting on me to cover for him again , even though he was n't sure why I 'd done it , any more than I was . . . . He figured I must want something from him . I realized he was right . I just had to figure out what it was . " Somebody had stripped his brains . He 'd been reprogrammed to act human , but he was n't . He was just a . . . a bioware death machine . " The memory of what had been done to him made my jaw clench until my teeth hurt . " Who was he ? " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Charon waved his hand , pushing the dead man aside like yesterday 's weather report . " No one important . " I looked at him , looked away again . " What is important , " he said , his voice dropping until it was barely audible , " is who did it to him . " Now his face showed something . Now he was angry , frustrated , sick with rage , aching for revenge . They 'd analyzed every dripping millimeter of the human bomb 's remains , without finding a clue . But he had to know  --  not because whoever had done it had destroyed one life , or four , in a way that would make a hit man retch . How they 'd done it , what they 'd done , did n't matter to him half as much as the fact that they 'd done it to Centauri . . . to him . " I do n't know who did it , " I said , too softly . He leaned toward me , his eyes hot and hard . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind . Who wired him ? Who sent him here ? " I shook my head . " I told you , I do n't know ! Whoever did it was good  --  they did n't leave any fingerprints . " " Is he telling the truth ? " Charon said to Braedee . Braedee nodded . I frowned . " He did n't even know who he was looking for . They 'd  | set him up so that when his eyes registered the right visual cue , he 'd drink that drink . He did n't know anything until he saw it " Her . Elnear . I saw him in my mind , trying so damn hard to swallow that drink down before she got away from him . If only Jardan had really made him spill it . If only I 'd understood what it meant , before it was too late ... . " You knew about the drink ? " he asked , his voice jerking my attention back . I nodded . " I knew  --  but it was too late . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glanced at Braedee again . " I just did n't figure it out until there was n't time to stop him . All there was time for was hitting the floor . What the hell was in it ? " You said it was harmless . The words almost got out of me . " A glass of wine with a few random molecules of ceboric in it , " Braedee said , thin-lipped . " It appeared perfectly innocuous  --  and it was , until it catalyzed the LDA they 'd planted in his stomach . Then it blew him up . " " I know . I saw that part . " I looked down , swallowing . " Then there 's nothing  --  absolutely nothing else you can tell us about who set up this attack ? " Charon said . I hesitated , searching my memory for something I might have forgotten , or refused to remember because it was too ugly . . . . Finally I shook my head . " No sir . I told you everything . There just was n't anything in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Braedee . " Now what ? This is critical , goddamnit . I want answers . You said nothing could go wrong  --  and everything has . You slipped , Braedee , you nearly cost Centauri Elnear . She 's no good to us dead ? " He stood up , looking like he had something down his shirt , gnawing at his flesh . Braedee glanced at me , frowning , as if he was afraid I was hearing too much . . . . Too much about what ? He looked back at Charon , his face under control again , as he said , " The psion served his intended purpose , sir . " Every word carried a weight on it . Iron . Irony . It took me an extra beat to realize that he was talking about me . " He filled a breach in our security , just as I said he would ; one that could not have been filled any other way . Because of that Lady Elnear is still secure . " Not alive ; secure . " Your stepson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ credit as calmly as if it belonged to him . " The attack was almost undetectable . Not many of our competitors have the capability for something like that , even if they have the intent . "  | " What about Triple ( ice ' ? " " " Their ambassadors did n't know anything about it , " I said . " That does n't prove anything , " Braedee murmured . " But the way it happened was too imaginative for Triple Gee 's Security . " " Anybody can hire a specialist , " I said . " There 's plenty of arm in the Lack Market , who 'll kill anybody for you , any way you want it done . That does n't take much imagination . " Something that did n't make sense bumped up against the back of my eyes as I said it . The other attacks on Elnear had been so crude they were almost a joke . Nothing at all like this one . " That 's impossible , " Charon said coldly . " No combine 's board would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they looked at me . They actually meant that . They had their own armies , spies , assassins . They thought they did n't need outsiders . " You mean it 's more fun if you do it yourself ? " The stares got blacker . " Look , this attack does n't match the others at all . Maybe they gave up and turned it over to somebody who knew what the hell they were doing . " They looked at each other . The subvocal exchange between them said they knew I was wrong . They knew . How could they be so sure ? I sank a quiet hook deeper into Charon 's brain . " What about the Lack Market ? " Charon murmured , his eyes still on Braedee . " Could there be any possible tie-in ? ? " " Hardly , " Braedee said . He was back in the control seat again . I 'd covered his ass , he did n't have to worry about Charon any more ; just me . " It 's in their interest to keep the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Charon nodded , thinking Elnear was n't exactly the sort to get into trouble over secret gaming debts . But then he was back to wondering who was taking advantage of this , and why ? ? Panic alarms were going off inside him . He had no idea who it could be , he only knew this attack had nothing to do with the things that had happened before . I pushed deeper : There was no doubt in his mind Braedee 's head swiveled around ; he gave me a strange look . " What 's the matter with you ? " he said . " Me ? " I blinked , pulling back fast . He looked pained . " I 'm not talking to myself . " " I 'm ... just trying to think . " They acted like they were thinking about this for the first time . Like they 'd never really considered any of this before ...  | " Do it without your mouth hanging open . " He looked hack at Charon . " What about him ? " Me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us all he knows , obviously . Send him away . " He was looking straight at me , but still talking about me as if I could n't understand a direct command . " I do n't mean that , " Braedee said . " I 'm talking about keeping him on . " Charon 's head jerked back toward him . His mouth tightened , as he barely stopped a refusal . " Are you serious ? " Half sarcasm , half incredulity . " After what he did last night , yes , sir . We still need him .. . His function has simply changed . " " He fed the hypers last night , for God 's sake ! Did you access the Morning Report ? ? " I sucked in a breath , imagining what kind of cretin they must have made me look like . " I only wanted to help the Lady , sir . After the way Stryger lied about me , I thought if I could make them understand the truth .... " " You wanted to help ! " His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corner of the couch , as his sudden fresh anger slammed into my unguarded thoughts . He 'd seen the ' cast , and he thought I had helped her . And that was the last thing he 'd wanted . He wanted her alive .. . but discredited , demoralized , a failure  --  under his thumb . " You misbegotten guttersnipe . " His hand loosened , and he pushed to his feet . " All the more reason to keep him here , at least until the vote , " Braedee said . " It would look bad . " I stopped listening as sick realization filled me up . They had n't planned to keep me on until they found out who was trying to kill Elnear . . . because nobody was trying to kill Elnear . They 'd staged the attacks themselves  --  Centauri , Braedee , under the direction of the board ; of Charon . Just enough to throw her off-balance , to frighten her , to make her dependent on them and their Security . Just enough so they could force her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 'd lied to me  --  they 'd been using me all along , to spy on her , just like she 'd figured . But more than that  --  they knew that Stryger hated psions . So they 'd set me up as a target , and let him knock me down . So that they could make sure Elnear would be humiliated and lose the debate , and the vote , and the seat Except that somebody had found out about the phony attacks on her , and tried to use them to cover up a separate attack , not knowing  | that the others had all been faked . So now Centauri really did have an attempted assassination on its hands . " 1 ) o what you want with him , then , " Charon was saying . He started for the door . " Just get results . And control him  --  keep him away from mc . " He had to pass by me one last time to get to the door . He glanced down at me , as if something had caught his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earring ? " I shook my head , still dazed . I raised my hand to my ear ; felt the slick , cold surface of the cut glass under my fingertip . Froze . " I ? uh  --  got it from a street vendor . " He grunted , and went on out . The door sealed behind him , leaving me alone with Braedee . " All right , " Braedee said . " What do you want ? " " What ? " I could n't remember what he was talking about . I rubbed my eyes , feeling the pressure/pain build behind them . " You know what I 'm talking about . " He moved two steps one way , two steps back , his hands locked behind him . His eyes were on me all the time . " To keep quiet about last night . " I laughed . It did n't sound real . " Oh . That . " He stopped moving . " What the hell 's the matter with you ? " He was half afraid that I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You used me , " I said . " You bastard , you were using me all the time  --  you and the taMings . There was no plot against the Lady , not before last night ! You set her up , so you could use me to fuck her over . " He stared at me . " How do I know all that ' ? " Taking the words right out of his mind . " How do you think I know , deadhead ? " His face went white with fear , and fury . He looked at the chair we 'd both sat in . " It did n't work , Braedee . " His black eyes snapped back to me . " You were reading us all along , . You sat down anyway . Why ? " " Come on , " I said . " Would n't you have done it , if you were me ? " He looked at the chair again . " I did n't think it was possible . " For me to have fooled his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He 'd really believed I was that much of a coward . That stupid . A punk kid , another screwed-up freak . No threat , no problem . " Surprise , " I said .  | And then I watched his hand reach for the gun hidden under the smooth line of his uniform jacket . . . . For a minute he really did n't know whether he was going to let me live or kill me I sat there while he decided , feeling my palms go clammy with sweat as I suddenly wondered if I 'd misread him even worse than he 'd misread me . His hand came out of his coat again , at last . He needed me ... He was still frowning , thinking I knew everything he thought ; but I watched his body ease out of its systems alert . He lifted his shoulders , in something that almost looked like a shrug . " So you know it all , now . I 'll repeat my question  --  what do you want ? " I sighed . " How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see if I 'd get one . I did n't . " You want me to work for you  --  for real , this time . Lady Elnear 's no good to you dead , and you really think I can do something to help you keep her alive . That 's what you were telling Charon . Right ? " He nodded , barely . " That 's what I want , too . " He looked surprised . " Why ? " My mouth twisted . " You want to hear something else I 've learned since I came here ? The only real difference between a combine vip like Charon and a streetrat like me is how many people believe the lies we tell . . . . I do n't enjoy feeling like your whore . And that 's what I 'll feel like if I leave now . I want to finish this job , now that it means something . " His eyes narrowed . " I suppose that 's reasonable . " He did n't know what to believe about me any more , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . " He smiled , relieved . He could relate to that . " That 's what I thought . Centauri will double the amount of your contracts . " " All of it  --  for the Center , too . " " Of course . " He nodded . " Do it now . " He glanced away from me for a long second , and back . " It 's done . " " I 'll check it when I get home . " The formless couch was beginning to give me a sensory deprivation attack . I stood up , shaking it off . " What happened to Elnear 's Security people ? " They 'd been witnesses  --  the only witnesses  --  to my warning him about the bomb . " Do n't ask questions you do n't really want answered . " He folded his arms ; watching my expression . " You think you 've figured out how to play this game , do n't you ? Just because you hold the key pieces ,  | right now . " lie shook his head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had beginner 's luck . Do n't push it . " Meaning that I 'd been stupid not to spill what I knew about him when I had the chance . Because if he had n't decided right then that he needed me , there would have been one more fatality after that explosion . I rubbed my hands on my pants legs . Then I said , " There 's one more thing I want . " He raised his eyebrows . " What is it ? " " I need stronger drugs . " " No . " His mind closed like a door . " I 'm still half-crippled , Braedee . What you got me is n't good enough . I ca n't do what I need to do , if you really want my help . " My hands flexed . " And I 'm starting to get . . . symptoms . " " I ca n't get you anything stronger . The board would n't permit it . I had a hell of a time even getting you this far . " " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Elnear winds up dead , Centauri loses ChemEnGen . And you lose , too . . . . That 's heavier on the scale than what Gentleman Charon thinks of psions . " " I ca n't do it . " " You owe me . Get me the drugs . " " I ca n't . " He shook his head . " You underestimate how difficult it is for me to get what you need . That 's not some streetcorner dreamdot you 're asking for . Charon monitors everything that 's done concerning you . . . . You also underestimate how much he resents your presence here . " I made a face , my hands tightening again . " I 'll give you this , " he said finally . " I 'll give you space . If you can get what you want somewhere else , I wo n't stop you . " I nodded , surprised . " Lady Elnear is still at the hospital . She is expecting you to join her there . I do n't have to tell you to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ? " I hesitated . " I guess not . " He nodded at the door . Somehow it had opened again while my back was turned . I started for it , happy to be going out . " One more thing . " I stopped . " What ? " " That earring . I would n't wear it again , if 1 were you . Particularly not around Charon . "  | My hand went to my ear , covering it , protecting it . " Why not ? " Not quite able to keep all the tension out of my voice . " It 's only a piece of glass . " His lips pulled up . " It 's an emerald , you fool . " I stared at him , still touching my ear . " What ? ? " He 'd scanned its density just by looking at me . He looked at me now , and shook his head again . " You 're lying about where you got it , too . It carries a taMing registry code ; it belongs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side . I turned and went out the door . I felt his eyes following my back as I crossed the endless , lifeless room beyond . ELNEAR WAS WAITING in still another private lounge when I got to the med center . She looked like a different woman from the one we 'd left there last night . Philipa was going to live . It was all over her face , her mind . " How is she ? " I asked the question anyway , so that she could tell me herself . " She 's going to be fine . Everything is going to be fine . " She stood up , smiling that smile that made you feel like you 'd just stepped into sunlight . Actually smiling it at me . After spending time with Braedee and Charon , getting that smile was like winning a prize . Right then I probably would have jumped out a window if she 'd asked me to . The smile faded again , as she said , " Someone said that you were injured ? " I touched my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , too . " Nothing much , " I said softly , remembering to answer  | her , " ma'am . Glad to hear the good news . " Not as glad as she was , but close , for her sake . " Have you seen her ? " Linear shook her head . " No . She 's still in the intensive unit ; she 'll he there until the reconstructive work is finished . It will be several weeks , they say . " Her voice got a little weak . " She 's suspended , of course , so she would n't know that I was there .... " But still she wished she could be . " At least she 'll have only peace , no memory of  --  of this pain . " " She 's lucky to have friends like you . " Saying it because I could n't help remembering what happened to people who did n't have friends like her . Loyal ... and rich . I touched my shoulder again , looking away at the flow-mural wavering aimlessly over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but she only asked , " Have you talked with Braedee ? " I nodded . I sat down on the long sofa next to her , suddenly feeling tired . " I seem to have misjudged Centauri , for once . It seems he was right all along about how much I needed you . " I kept my face empty . " Yes , ma'am . I guess so . " " Are you still thinking about yesterday ? " she said , trying to read my expression . " About Stryger ? About all the  --  injustice ? " I was thinking about today . But I nodded , because hearing her say Stryger 's name suddenly made me remember yesterday . I looked back at her , as the final thing she 'd said registered . Injustice . " Yes , " she said , answering what was clear enough on my face now . " I 've seen the Morning Report . " I laughed once . " I slept through it . " The Indy 's Morning Report  --  that was what Charon had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Or at least not as bad as I 'd figured . " I seem to be the only person in the galaxy who missed it . " " I hope so . " She smiled again , but this time it was full of steel . " I hope everyone sees it . Do you want to see it now ? I can call it up . I nodded , and the mural that no one had been watching suddenly disappeared from the wall across the room . A new image came onscreen , jumping out at us as it went threedy . Sound came with it in a blare that made me wince . Shander Mandragora was suddenly in the room , somehow looking me right in the eye while he repeated yesterday 's news . The only way I could tell he was n't actually there was by the empty place where his mind should have been . But then , after what I 'd seen last night , that probably did n't prove anything . I waited  | for some lurid full-feed of the bombing ; feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ report was on the debate between Elnear and Stryger . Images from it opened out behind Mandragora as if he could project his own memories ; he could , in a way . I watched Stryger tell his lies about me again . I started to frown , wondering why Elnear wanted to make me look at this . And then suddenly it was me up there , " refuting the charges in his own words " ? reliving last night , up against the wall with Lazuli and Jiro while the hypers closed in on me . I looked down , away from it . But Elnear 's hand closed on my shoulder , giving me a gentle shake , forcing me to look up at the screen again . " I killed him in self defense ! " my reflection shouted , looking me straight in the eye . " And to save my friends , and to save your stinking telhassium . I was n't a traitor , I worked for the FTA ? " But before I heard the insult I 'd blurted next , my image @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how the Indy had " researched these conflicting versions of the incident . Here is the actual record , " he said , not even smiling . " Let it speak for itself . " He stepped aside , into some spacewarp , and I sat up straighter , with all my attention on the show now as I saw something I 'd never seen before : part of an original tape about what had happened after I 'd killed Quicksilver . A Mines official I remembered , a man named Tanake , was describing how the psionic arch-criminal Quicksilver and his terrorists had nearly taken control of the telhassium supply . His version of what had happened did n't match my memories of it ; probably just as well . But then he was thanking the FTA 's Security Arm for " fighting fire with fire " ; admitting right there in front of the entire Federation that it had been psions working undercover inside Quicksilver 's terrorist group who 'd been the ones who stopped him  --  the only ones who could have done it , mind against mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change of scene , and suddenly I was looking out across a winter-white Quarro from someplace up high : Jule and Siebeling stood together on the balcony of a house . . . being interviewed , having their five minutes of fame . They did n't look like they were enjoying it much ; but they did their best to make a good impression . The voice-over and visual stats were making a lot of Siebeling 's professional standing and Jule 's family ties ; trying to prove something . I watched them , listened to them , breathing in a memory  | of the cold sharp air of a winter 's day with every breath . Siebeling did most of the talking , like he always did , used to it . Jule had always saved her words , turned them into poems instead . Siebeling was talking about Dere Cortelyou , the corporate telepath who 'd first broken through my mental walls and forced my mind out of hiding . Our friend , who 'd died there on Cinder , killed by Quicksilver . Then I listened to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beside them when I was the one who deserved the real credit for stopping Quicksilver ... . I tried to touch the place where my mind had been while that was happening  --  could n't . A dizziness like the fear of falling made my brain sing . . . I had a nervous breakdown , " my mirror image was saying across the room . " That 's what it means to be a psion , and kill somebody . . . . " I looked up , seeing myself last night again , trapped , badgered , like an animal in a cage . " ... And I guess it still does n't mean shit to be a psion and a hero . " I watched myself push out of view and disappear , as Mandragora suddenly reappeared , to point out the obvious , about me , about me and the Lady , about Stryger 's " incomplete data . " It was n't exactly an apology , and the asinine questions he 'd thrown at me himself had all been trimmed away . But he 'd given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't such a bastard . Elnear was leaning back on the couch , her arms folded comfortably , watching me with a look that was somewhere between curiosity and satisfaction . I shook my head , as the fax finally winked off , taking the past with it . " So , " she said . " The truth sets us free . " I turned toward her . " You really think that can make up for what Stryger did ? " " It will certainly help . Why  --  do n't you believe that it will ? " " It 's only one version of the story . The lies have already got it outnumbered . " I shrugged . " Even what you saw was n't really the truth . It was what happened . . . but it was n't the truth . " I thought about Centauri . They 'd been a part of the truth for me back then , just like they were now ; part of the combine conspiracy that had backed Quicksilver . I wondered how many people in the entire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and somebody might even have listened to her . But she had n't told anyone . Blood was still thicker than water . Elnear sat there next to me , looking tired but content . She thought  | she knew the whole truth about what had happened at the Federation Mines on Cinder ; she thought she knew the whole truth about what was happening now . I could n't let her go on believing it . She had to know everything about what Centauri had done . She 'd never win otherwise , never get clear of them . I remembered where we were , and how easily even the hypers had planted eavesdroppers last night . I could n't tell her anything here . " Ma'am , I have n't eaten yet . How about you ? I saw a noodle joint a couple of levels up , on my way here ? " She looked surprised at the sudden change of subject . But then she realized how exhausted , how hungry , she really was . " Yes , of course . . . I have n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have much of an appetite then . " She smiled , rueful . " But there 's no need to go out ; I can have food brought to us here . " " Hospital food ? " I asked , and made a face . Damn . " I 'd rather have a plate of noodles . " " It can be anything you want , " she said , still smiling . " Do you really want that ? " I 'd forgotten what it meant to be a taMing , for just a minute ... . I put my foot up across my knee ; my fist began to tap a frustrated rhythm on it . I rested my head against the wall , staring at nothing , as I reached out with all the gentleness and control I could still manage , and touched her mind . ( Lady , ) I thought . She jerked ; her eyes went wide . ( Do n't panic  --  I need to talk to you . Outside . ) She sat blinking for a second as if someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she seemed to register me again , she murmured , " Well . . . perhaps you 're right . I ca n't stay here forever . There are things to be done . Now that I know Philipa will be all right .... " She got up , following my lead like a sleepwalker . By the time we were in a mod she 'd taken charge again , taking us back to the FTA plex , through the security scanners , into what ought to be the most privacy anyone could hope for on this planet . But we did n't go to her office . Instead she took me to the delegate 's restaurant , on an open terrace at the pinnacle of an ancient tower . The roof garden was filled with small tables underneath umbrellas of living tree . You could look out and down across the geologic layers of time and structure that made up the city all around , and yet still believe you were out in the open air under a perfect sky . The sky was a monomole shield , so flawless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , looking up at it from below . The higher towers touched it , supported it like rigid fingers .  | I ; Inear ordered us lunch , and spent the time until it came pointing out historic landmarks to me , as if there was nothing more important on either of our minds . Some of the pre-space structures went hack eight hundred years ; and this was a new city , for Earth . I remembered when I 'd thought the buildings in Oldcity were old . There 'd been so much intermediate buildup here that by now it was hard to tell what the forms of most of the original structures had been . The one I could see best was an inverted cone , the whole building balanced on a tip a few dozen meters wide . " It was built when composites were first introduced , " Elnear said , when I asked about it . " The architects of the period tended to be a little . . . giddy . " She smiled . The food came , laid out like it belonged in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the perfectly designed plate , but I was too hungry to let it stop me for long . It tasted better than it looked . I sighed , looking out at the view , as pastry shaped like flowers dissolved in my mouth . Thinking that I could get used to this . . . I glanced back at Elnear . She was staring at me , the way she 'd look at something she was thinking of making into a painting . " Ma'am ? ? " I said , suddenly aware of every square centimeter of my body ; wondering if I 'd made an ass of myself somehow . I 'd thought Jardan had driven enough basic protocol into my brain to at least let me eat in public . But she said , " It was no exaggeration to call you a hero for what you did last night . Or to call what you did for the Federation on Cinder an act of heroism . . . what all of you did there , but especially you . You deserve ? " I glanced away . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , cutting her off . " What would you call it , then ? " she asked . " Survival , " I said . " I did what I had to , to survive . I killed Quicksilver because he was going to kill us . I did n't have a choice . There was nothing heroic about it . " Nothing at all . I frowned , looking down , seeing my reflection trapped in the tabletop . " How did you become a part of the undercover operation that stopped him ? " She had n't even known that Jule had been a part of it , until yesterday ; had n't believed it , until today . . . . But by now everyone 's blind ignorance was beginning to make sense to me . What we 'd done on Cinder had almost cost Centauri everything  --  and one of us had been one of their own . They must have done all they could to suppress or distort the news about it ; and they were n't the only ones  | involved . Maybe it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the real story . I looked back at Elnear . There was nothing but respect , honest curiosity , behind her question . I laughed , and shook my head . " How ? ? The hard way , just like everything else I ever did back in Oldcity . I got away from a press gang , and the District Corpses picked me up for making fools of the Labor Crows . They tested me for psi ? they were testing everybody they hauled in , because the FTA was looking for psions . Psions are all criminals , right ; how else would you find one ? ? " I smiled , and she looked down . " That 's when I met Jule ; she was in the group too . Siebeling was in charge of it . He 'd set it up like a kind of therapy group , an excuse to teach us all how to use our Gift , and have the FTA pay for it . The FTA hoped we 'd attract Rubiy ? " " Rubiy ? " " Quicksilver . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I said , not sure why it bothered me that nobody remembered that . " They knew he 'd be looking for recruits . They could n't get at him any other way , and they figured , no big loss if he found out the truth and killed a few freaks .... " She blinked . " A catspaw , " she murmured . " A what ? " " A catspaw ' is someone used by someone else to do a job that is unpleasant or dangerous . " " Yeah . " I nodded . " That fits . It worked , too . Rubiy picked four of us , sent us to work with his people on Cinder who were trying to break the Mines ' security . " She glanced away , confusion starting in her thoughts . " If you were working undercover for the FTA , then why ? ? " Remembering my scars . I touched my back , my mouth twisting . " Like I said , the truth 's never that simple . Siebeling and me . . . we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threw me out of the group , sent me back to Contract Labor . But when Rubiy found out , he used it  --  he got me sent to the Mines . I was his inside man . " The world faded into white , into the memories of what I 'd seen there , and what had been done to me . . . the times when I 'd wanted Rubiy to succeed . He 'd even counted on that . " Rubiy would have given me anything I 'd wanted if I 'd given him the Mines . " He 'd trusted me , because he thought we were the same  --  dead inside . There were times when I 'd nearly believed that myself .  | But he was wrong . I blinked , my eyes smarting with the burn of memory . " Why did n't you ? " Elnear said , her gaze steady now . I looked down . The plate of half-eaten food in front of me seemed like an hallucination . I shook my head . " Because of Jule . She taught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That I was still .. . alive . That I could still care about someone else . " I kept looking down . " I guess she taught both of us that . I wonder how she knew so much about it ? " Elnear did n't say anything . " Why did you marry a taMing , anyway ? " I asked it , finally . " Why did you let them get such a hold on you ? Did they make you do it ? " She looked back at me , half smiled as she realized that I was only doing what she 'd just done . " Oh , no , " she said . " I was n't forced into anything . I married Kelwin because I wanted to , and he wanted me to . I was much younger , then .... " Meaning not just in years . " I loved him very much . What more did I need to know ? ? " She 'd thought that she had protected her interests . She 'd thought that he would live forever . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away on Centauri business , on Dandrosa , when it happened . There was a massive intrasystem failure .... The details do n't matter . They found evidence of sabotage . " She looked away , her folded hands tightening on the tabletop . " It was shortly after Jule 's mother died . " " What happened to her ? " " She had a drug problem . " Elnear was still looking somewhere else . " They said it was an accidental overdose . But ever since the family had learned that Jule was  --  was ? " ( defective ) , her mind said , helplessly , instinctively , " ? a psion , there had been suspicions , accusations of some sort of genetic tampering or falsification of hereditary charts .... " " You 're telling me you think the taMings killed her ? " I remembered Lazuli not-quite-saying something about Jule 's mother , Charon 's first wife . Elnear shrugged . " Nothing was ever proved . . . in either case . Jule 's mother had ties to Triple Gee . The marriage was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain planetary interests in the same system where Kelwin died . "  | " So she was a hostage . " And maybe a saboteur . Elnear looked up again , almost startled . " Perhaps , in a sense . " Her eyes turned bleak . " But then , are n't we all hostages to fortune . . . ? " " So maybe your husband had to die because she did ? " Maybe I did n't want to get used to this life , after all . " Perhaps . " She got up , restlessly , as if part of her wished I 'd leave it alone . But part of her wanted it , needed it . " How long ago ? " " Sixteen years . " No hesitation . She could have told me how many months , days . . . seconds . " It should have been Charon . " She turned back , her hands clenched now . ( It should have been Charon . ) It had crystallized in her own mind at the same instant it had come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , to her half frown . " You did n't think of it first . " She pressed her lips together , tried to wipe her eyes without me seeing her do it . She sat down again , her mind as open , as defenseless , as any human mind ever was . " All I 've really wanted , " she said finally , so softly that the thought was almost louder , " for sixteen years , was to see it through . " Her work , her legacy , her life . Trying to hold on to what still had some meaning , trying to keep Centauri and the taMings from taking it all away from her : that had become her whole life , since she 'd lost him . When she died they lost her holdings too because there were no children , and they knew it . No wonder she had n't been interested in setting back her clocks , once Kelwin was gone . But she was n't interested in being assassinated , either . . . . It had been easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you could never be sure anyone 's death was from natural causes . Her face changed , as she finally felt ready to hear whatever I wanted her to know : " What was it that you were going to tell me ? " I glanced away , out over the glaciers of glass and stone , suddenly uneasy again . Maybe this open terrace was really as shielded as the offices down below , but I could n't believe it . Braedee had said he 'd leave me alone , but I knew how much that was worth . He did n't want me telling Elnear the truth , and God only knew who else had what kind of long eyes watching . They said ignorance was bliss . The more I knew about this world , the more paranoid I felt . I could n't be sure of anything  --  except myself . ( Lady , ) I said , very gently again , mumbling something pointless out loud for any ears that were listening . ( I have to be sure . Do n't fight  | nic ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could tell that inside her something was happening that no one else could see . When I was sure she was really ready , I reached out again , letting the message form as softly as snow . ( Lady ... no one was trying to kill you , before last night . ) Her head jerked with surprise and confusion . I let the images implode as her incredulity crushed them ; waiting until she could deal with what it meant to her . ( I found out today from Charon . The same way you 're finding it out from me ? ) She kept blinking at me , like someone taking drugs . But she nodded , letting me know she understood , ready for what came next . ( Centauri started it as a way to get at you , scare you , keep you under control . ) I let her see how and why , using the images like an information feed . I began to get feedback as she realized it was the same kind of harassment she 'd endured all along , only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold of her as she tried harder to get away . ( They used me to spy for them , Lady , just like you thought . . . even to set you up for Stryger . ) I winced at the stab of her betrayal . ( A catspaw , ) I thought , without meaning to . That 's what she 'd called it ; that 's what I 'd been , again . ( I did n't know . They used me ! ) Letting my own anger batter hers back , tired of taking the blame . I 'd been fucked over by Centauri too . . . and not for the first time . ( Centauri was part of the conspiracy behind Rubiy that nearly got me killed . And they got away from it clean . If I hate the FTA for what happened to me out on Cinder , I hate Centauri worse ? ) I let her see it , let her see why , until she really believed that none of this had happened because I 'd wanted it to . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showed her the rest of it . That now there really was a threat , and Centauri did n't want her to die any more than she did . That even Charon thought I had a use now . That I was n't going to leave until it was over , and she was safe ; until I 'd made it up to her . She stared at me , not even blinking now , as if she was beyond anger , or surprise , almost beyond any emotion at all . " Thank you , " she murmured , finally , although that was n't what she wanted to say . Gratitude was the farthest thing from her mind after what she 'd just learned . . . the way she 'd learned it . And yet She put her hand out blindly ; needing real , solid , contact with another human . . . and there was no doubt left in her mind that I was as human as she was . There should have been a better way to put it , but I could n't think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it the way she  | meant it . I got up from the table after a minute , looking hack at her . My smile hardly pinched at all as I said , " Ma'am , right now I 've got some  --  business I 've got to work out . I do n't know how long it 'll take . " " What kind of business ? " she asked , suddenly uncertain again . I shook my head . " Calling in some favors . " " This is going to help us find out what really happened last night ? " " I hope so .... It 's better if you do n't ask , " I said , stopping her before she did . Her mouth pressed shut , her forehead wrinkled . She wished that I 'd trust her , not really believing there were things she really would n't want to know about me . I started to turn away , hesitated . " Lady , how much do you think Stryger really wants that Security Council slot ? " She looked at me blankly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shook her head . " You ca n't imagine that he would try to have me killed .... " Incredulity that was almost laughter filled her voice . " Braedee does n't think that walking bomb was a hire job . I do . He ca n't think of a combine that would do it for themselves , but he thinks they 're too proud to use the Lack Market . You know Stryger 's got combines behind him . They think he 's just another catspaw  --  but that 's not what Stryger thinks . He wants that slot for the same reason you do , to get himself free of them . He wants the power , real bad . I think he 'd kill to get it . " She shook her head again , half smiling as she began to get up from her seat . " Cat , I understand why you feel this way . But I assure you , Sojourner Stryger may be too intense for his own good  --  he may even be something of a fanatic  --  but he is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't he ? He smeared you , and me , right up there in front of God and everybody , to get what he wanted ? " " He could have been sincere . He claims that he was misinformed .... " " Why are you defending him ? " I said . She did n't answer me . " Do you really still think he 's better than you ? " My hands dropped to my sides . " Lady , " I said finally . " I met someone like that once . He picked me up on the street in Oldcity , bought me the first decent meal I 'd had in about a week . And while I was eating , he was talking to me about how psions were evil and unnatural , because they had these abilities .... " Something that was n't really a laugh caught in my throat . I had n't known what he was talking about , why he was saying those things to me , staring into my green eyes with their long  | slit pupils . . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room and heat the crap out of me ... She sat down on the edge of the table , her mouth open , her mind groping . " Why ? " she murmured at last , weakly . " Why did n't you leave . . . ? " " Because that 's what he was paying me for . " I left the restaurant . " WELL , " ARGENTYNE SAID , as she met me at the door , " somehow I did n't expect to see you here again . At least not so soon . " Her silver eyebrows rose , asking silent questions , as she pulled the door to Purgatory open wider . " Do n't tell me you 're lonely . " She was still blocking the doorway with her body . I stood on the steps , suddenly feeling more self-conscious than I thought I knew how to . " I wish I was . Lonely , I mean . . . . Is Daric here ? " She laughed , ruffling her hair . " Is it still daylight ? " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes out at night . " " That figures . " I pushed my hands deeper into my pockets . " You want to see him ? " " No . " " And you 're not here to close me down , or you would n't be here alone . So what can I do for you ? " She yawned , the camph she 'd been sucking on dangling from her fingers . I realized suddenly that she was yawning the way an animal yawned , instinctively showing teeth . Yawning because she was nervous , even a little afraid . Just like I was . It made her real , easier to look at without feeling my brain seize up . " I need directions . " I glanced over my shoulder at the street  | behind me . The water line was halfway up the dome , hut there was still a wide stretch of sky visible . The map in my head had brought me this far , but it ended at the water line . " The map ends here . " And no map @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed to know , anyway . " You want to go off the Deep End ? " She looked incredulous again . " Alone ? Why ? " Now that I really knew why they called it that , I wished I did n't . " It 's not something I want to do . And it 's not something I want to talk about in the middle of the street . " I jerked my head at the swirl of bodies in random motion behind me . Argentyne stepped aside , opening the way for me into the club 's interior . " Sorry . I just got up . It always takes me a while to regain consciousness . " Her mouth curved in a wry smile . " It 's so early , you know . " I grinned , stepping inside . " Yeah , I know what you mean . Or I used to . " " You used to be a performer ? " she asked . " Sort of . " " And then you got respectable . " She led me back along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a soft robe that looked like it had been made out of a bedspread ; most of the color had faded out of it a long time ago . It was something she wore because she loved it a lot . I looked down at my neat , perfect , Centauri-branded clothes . " Not by choice , " I said . The club was nearly empty , gray with filtered daylight . A couple of indifferent floods lighted up the darker corners so the drones could finish their work , siphoning up the detritus of a hard night . The space and silence made it seem like a different building from the one I 'd been in yesterday . Up on the stage a handful of bodies were clustered by a single bare table , sprawled across each other in the small island of cushions around it , looking like they 'd had too much of something : I recognized the players of her symb . " Rehearsal , " she explained , nodding toward the stage . It felt more like a mass hangover to me . " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remembering the way their separate kinds of music had fused into a perfect web of sound , the mindwarping visuals that had come rippling out through the noise . . . suddenly remembering who she was again ; suddenly feeling awkward and self-conscious again .  | She looked at me , about to toss off some remark about my own performance here . Seeing my face , she only said , " Glad you enjoyed it . Glad you enjoyed something about last night . " She glanced down , embarrassment and leftover anger at Daric blurring her memory , and we were back on the same ground again . " That was n't the usual crowd , last night , " she said . " That was a private party . I just wanted you to know . " That it would n't happen again . I did n't say anything . " You like the muse , huh ? " she asked , to fill up the silence . I nodded . " You sure you would n't like to complete a circuit yourself ? " She climbed onto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was n't an offer she made often , or to just anybody . It was an apology ; and something more . I climbed up after her , more than surprised . But a kind of panic started to choke me the second I thought about taking her seriously . I shook my head . " I do n't have any talent . " " You never know until you try . We could wire you ourselves . Nobody would have to know . It takes no time ; it does n't even hurt . " She lifted her hair with her hand , showing me the flesh-colored jack on the back of her neck . She was still thinking about what she 'd felt last night . " Would n't you like to find out ... ? " She wanted to find out  --  what it would be like to link me into something bigger , and play my mind . Her copper stare met me , dared me . I glanced away at the players , wondering what they 'd think of that . " Maybe . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too much else on my mind right now . Besides , she might think it was nothing , but if the FTA 's security scans picked up that socket , I 'd be in deep shit . " Anyway , what you did last night was about as real as it gets . You do n't need a psion if you can make that happen with your own head . " She shook off the compliment . " Holograms . Cheap tricks . I can imagine it , but I ca n't make people share it , live it , even with illusions . You knew it was n't real .... " I grinned . " Yeah  --  but I forgot . And that 's the real magic , right ? If you can make people forget it 's not real . " She shrugged , annoyed and flattered . A couple of the players began to clap and whistle long trills , as we came toward them and my face registered . I felt my face start to go red , figuring last night here at the club was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yo , Cat . Caught you on the Morning Report , " and the other heads were nodding .  | Argentyne turned to look at me , curious . " What happened ? " She wondered suddenly if I 'd come down here to get away from something I 'd done . " He only saved your habit and a bunch of other vips after you threw him out of here . Some assassin blew himself into meat salad at a taMing hole last night . " The flute player bowed gracefully toward me . She was dressed metallic , as long and thin as the flexible pipes that had replaced the fingers on one of her hands . " Daric ? ? " Argentyne said , with a sudden sharp pang of guiltshockfear . " Daric  --  is he all right ? " I nodded unenthusiastically . " You saved him ? " she repeated . " It was an accident , " I said , and someone laughed , but it was n't her . " I was hired to guard Lady Elnear . He just got in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though a haze of mixed emotions . " Oh God , " she murmured , and looked away . " Why did n't he tell me himself . . . ? " " You still expect him to act like a human being ? " one of the players wearing a touchboard in his chest asked . " To treat you like one ? " " Oh , bugger off , Jax , " she said . " Who asked you ? " Under the silver skin , the silver hair , I got the feeling there was somebody a lot more normal than Daric was , maybe a lot more ordinary than she wanted to admit to herself . " Daric looked pretty fragged , " somebody else said gently . " Do n't worry about it . Maybe it 'll shake some steel into him . " He grinned , his teeth large and white against his blue-black skin and beard . He wore the beard tucked through his belt , and some instrument that looked like a sack full of light plugged into his neck . " Since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she asked him , still prickling . He shrugged , blinked his bloodshot eyes . " Up ? I have n't been to bed . " She half smiled ; twitched her shoulders to shake off her mood . " Well , " she murmured to me , rubbing her face , " thanks anyway , even if it 's thanks for nothing . Tell me what you 're looking for . If we 've got it , you can have it . " I glanced at the players , back at her . " They 're family , " she said . " And they 're not easily shocked . " She moved back to the edge of the stage and sat down , her bare feet  | dangling . The players shrugged and flopped down where they were , waiting . I sat down too , feeling less obvious that way . " I need some drugs . " Her face twitched almost imperceptably . She took the camph out of her mouth and looked at it . " Why do n't you just ask Daric ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that he does n't have what I need . " The twitch turned into a frown . " You 're in that deep ? You want hard stuff ? " She was surprised . I shook my head . " Just hard-to-get stuff . Topalase-AC . " She looked at me blankly . " What 's that ? I never heard of it . " " It lets me use my psi . " " You need drugs for that ? " she said . " I thought you were born that way . " " I was . " I explained , keeping it as short as I could . " Hm , " she said , when I was done . She pulled her knees up , hugging her ankles . " Why wo n't Centauri give you what you want ? " " Charon taMing 's a freakhater  --  Daric 's sister Jule is a psion . He 's afraid of me . " " Of you ? " She laughed . " Should I be insulted ? " I said . " Oh , hell no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jeezu , have you seen Charon ? ? " " Lots . " " Then you know what I mean .... So they want you to do this gig but they wo n't give you the equipment , is that it ? " I nodded . " That 's it . But Braedee said he would n't stop me from getting it myself . " " You really want to burn your brains out ? You care that much about them ? Why not just go along , play dumb and collect your pay ? " I thought about it . I looked back at her . " Why do you go with Daric ? Just for the money ? " It came out a little nastier than I 'd meant it to . ( Fuck you ? ) I heard it through her eyes , but then her expression changed . " It 's not like that . He 's not like he seems ? " Remembering last night , she broke off . " Well , maybe he is . . . but not when we 're alone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I care about him ? " " You love him . " Saying what she could n't make herself say .  | Asking the question even though it was none of my business , just because the idea was so unbelievable . She looked back at me , suddenly resenting it . " Sometimes . . So what if I do ? It 's none of your business , kid . " " I know , " I said . She thought about it a minute longer . " You care about Lady Elnear ? " I nodded . " Yeah . I guess I do . " Surprised by that , too . Without meaning to , I thought about Lazuli , and her children . I touched my ear , the emerald earring ; let my hand drop . " Lady Elnear wants to change the universe , " Argentyne said . " What about you ? " " Just part of it . " She laughed . " You got it , laddie love . " She climbed to her feet , looking back at the players . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anybody know where he could find someone to give him what he wants ? " The ones who were still awake shrugged , heads moved back and forth . No . " We do n't do a lot of drugs , " she said , as if she had to explain it . " It screws up our timing . " She stared at her feet , scratched her head . " Daric knows the territory better than any of us do . You got a sample of his dream jewelry last night . He plays hard , and he makes deals for his friends . . . . " She was worried that he played too hard , that he was already in too deep . " If you wo n't ask him , I can tell you who to talk to , and where to look for them . I ca n't promise they can fix you up . Maybe they 'd know who could . But frankly ? " She was looking back at me again , " I 'd ask Daric before I 'd try it alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a reason the Deep End 's not on the city maps , you know . The Lack Market runs it . It 's got a whole different set of rules . " I nodded , my mouth pulling up . " Yeah , I know . But I grew up in a place like that . I know how the people there think . I know what they 're thinking if I need to . " " Every place is different , " she said , the worry line still etched deep between her silver brows . " But if that 's what you want .... " She shrugged when I did n't say anything more . " You ca n't go under dressed like that . You 'd be dead before you got a hundred meters . Come on in the back . We 've got plenty of gear you can pick through . " She led me through the wings of the stage and down a corridor , pushed open a door . Inside , it looked like a costume shop having a nervous breakdown  --  clothing in piles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , tacked to the walls . " Help yourself , " she said , wading in . I followed her into the room , breathing in the strange , musty smell of the place . " I never saw this many clothes in my entire life . " " You can be anything you want to be , here . Clothes make the man  --  into a woman , if you want . Or vice versa . " She tossed a long striped wrap-skirt at me , grinning . I shook my head and dropped the skirt . " Androgyny 's very big right now , " she said . " You 'd look regular . " " If I have to run I might trip . " I picked up a loose yellow-brown tank top , held it out . Symbols from some pre-space language were printed inside a circle on the front of it . " Rolecrossing was real popular in Quarro about five years back . Everything keeps coming around .... " I took off my jacket and shirt . " Maybe someday it 'll even mean something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Quarro , huh ? " She sounded impressed . " You must be a real trendsetter . " I laughed once , pulling on the tank top . It was long and baggy , but it let me move . " I was lucky if I had a shirt on my back , most of the time I lived there . " " Uh-huh . . . . " She picked up a hat made of feathers and put it on . " Being poor sucks , especially in a rich town . " " I would n't know . " She looked at me , puzzled . " In Oldcity , if you did n't have a credit line , you could n't even leave . I never saw Quarro . " She made a face , suddenly feeling cold inside . " Being poor sucks , anywhere , " she said . " That 's why I wanted this club . After my five minutes of fame are over , I want to have somewhere to crawl home to . " I felt her remember her family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for good the day she 'd come home with silver skin . I nodded , thinking about Jule , and Siebeling . " Makes sense , " I said softly . I picked out some brown knit leggings and a heavy leather jacket . The jacket would give me some protection if I ran into a little trouble . . . . If I ran into a lot of trouble , even body armor would n't save me . " How long you been with Dane ? " " About a year and a half . I met him right after we went nova and started to play gigs above the waterline . " She was looking at me , but her gaze was somewhere else . " We were doing this exquisite private club , right up under the stars . Everybody there was some kind  | of famous , only they were all there for us ... it was the most incredible night of my life . And then Daric came up to me , after the show . He gave me a silver rose , and he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let me show you why . ' " She was seeing him now , the way he 'd looked to her that night : young and handsome , rich and confident . Remembering the way he 'd looked at her  --  as if he 'd never seen anyone more beautiful . Remembering the way he 'd made her believe that every word he said was true ... . I looked away from her face , sorry I 'd asked . " How do you like his family ? " Her mind snapped back to the present , and her smile turned black . " About as much as they like me . They scare the shit out of me . " I shook my head . " When I saw you with them , you looked like you were having a pretty good time raising their blood pressure . " She lifted her hand and made half a bow to me . " I 'm an entertainer . It 's all part of the act , love . . . . Daric enjoys it far more than I do . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night . You looked like you were in shock . Like you 'd crash-landed on the wrong planet . " " I had , " I said . " I felt sorry for you , until you stood up to Daric . Then I figured you for a survivor , after all . " I looked down . " Yeah , that 's one thing I 'm good at , anyway . " " Cat , " she said . I looked up . " Ask Daric . He can get what you want . I 'll even ask for you , if you want me to . He owes you that much . " I shook my head . " I ca n't trust him . " I already knew too much , about politics . " I know what you think of him . " She tossed the feather hat away , impatient . " You 're right , he 's fucked up . But there really is a human being inside there ? " " That 's what I 'm afraid of . " She cocked her head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finally . " You think you ca n't trust any of us , huh ? You think we 're all rotten , because you can see into our minds and read all our dirty little secrets ? ? " I looked down , picked up a pair of heavy gloves . " No . I do n't think that .... " I glanced up again , pulling them on . " I try not to , anyhow . " " Daric treats me better than anyone I 've ever known . " She was thinking about all the things he 'd done for her , given to her . Anything she wanted . He 'd set her up with this club , like I 'd figured  --  but she owned it , not him .  | " When he 's not treating you like shit . " I shrugged on the jacket . " Sure , why should n't he ? You 're beautiful , you 're famous , and his family thinks you 're trash . You 're everything he needs . " " You do n't know anything about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And you 're starting to piss me off . " I lifted my head . " What 's he ever done that 's decent , for anybody besides you ? " She looked away , searching her memory . " The girl , " she said , after thinking a little longer than she probably would have liked . " A while back he brought a kid here , a young girl . Somebody 'd beaten her up real bad . " Her face flinched . " He said he 'd just found her on the street , and could n't leave her there . He asked us to help her . So we did . " She put her hands on her hips , as if she was waiting for me to congratulate her . " He did n't do that out of anything but common humanity . " While inside her thoughts she was remembering something strange about the girl ; how the kid had looked like a street nothing , dressed in greasy rags . . . except she 'd had a face that looked like an exotic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slits for pupils . Like she 'd had expensive cosmetic surgery done ... . " A psion , " I said . " The way she looked  --  she was a psion . " " Who ? " Argentyne shook her head . " You mean the kid ? " Not asking me how I knew what the kid had looked like . She gave me one of those looks deadheads always gave me when I answered questions they had n't asked . " I do n't know . " " She did n't do anything  --  use her psi ? " " Not while she was here . " She shook her head again . " But she was n't here that long . He brought her in one night ; she was in shock , then . She could n't even move on her own . We patched her up and put her to bed upstairs . When I looked in the next morning she was already gone . I never saw her again . Daric asked about her ; he really cared about what had happened to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ playing godsend to a freak . I did n't know what the hell to make of that . Maybe she 'd reminded him of Jule . . . except I thought he hated Jule . I wondered if he 'd beaten her up himself . " I still ca n't trust him to know about this . You 've got to promise me you wo n't tell him I was , here . " She sighed . " If you 're that obsessed , who am I to stand in your way ? " She looked at my clothes . " Out of all this , you had to choose that ? " She waved a hand . I did n't answer , my mind still hooked on the image of a lost girl with green eyes , so terrified that all she knew how to do was disappear .  | I wondered if she 'd had any more idea of why somebody would want to beat the crap out of her than I 'd ever had . Maybe nobody could ever really understand a thing like that ... . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noticing she 'd moved . I stepped back , startled . Remembered she 'd said something about my clothes . " Thanks for the clothes , " I mumbled . " Just tell me who to look for . I 'll get out of here and stop pissing you off . " " We could bodypaint you a little , first ? " she offered , and I realized part of her was still trying to stall me . She was really afraid I 'd go out of here and get my head kicked in . I turned away , annoyed . " No . " I gestured at the clothes . " I know what I 'm doing . " I hesitated , turning back ; managed a smile . " But thanks for caring whether I do or not . " She smiled too , resigned . " It 's my curse . " She tied a hank of green scarf around my head . " Come on . " She nodded , and started back toward the door . THE TUBE THAT RAN under the bay from N'Yuk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three hundred years ago . It had n't been intended to make stops along the way . But then they ran out of room up above , and the city had started oozing off the end of the land into the cold , dark waters of the harbor . Now most of the sea bottom between the islands was covered with a separate city , clear domes spreading like a mass of fish eggs over the silty muck , reclaiming it for the air-breathers.  | But nobody could call that part of town real desirable , and so like Oldcity it had tilled up with the dregs , the losers and the users , the kind of people who slipped through holes in the combine nets  --  by choice , or because they could n't help themselves , and could n't find anybody else who wanted to help them either . The Tube made stops there now , and at the third one I got off . To reach the surface , I climbed about three hundred steps that smelled like piss , because the lift was out of order . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so bad  --  the FTA managed the services here like it did in Federal Trade Districts everywhere . They did a pretty good job of it . And then they left the human flotsam who lived there to drift , instead of taking care of them too . They needed their pools of desperate , unskilled labor all over the galaxy for their press gangs to feed off of , to sell to the combines to do their dirty work . I stepped over a sick dog that lay panting at the top of the lightstrung stairs , my hands clenched inside my jacket pockets as I looked around me at the graffiti and the garbage . I did n't want to touch anything , have the greasy dirt rub off on me , stick to my skin , pollute me . I felt sick when I remembered how it had been once , when I 'd been one of these people . When I had n't known where the filth stopped and my flesh started , and had n't even cared ... . " Shit ? " I said softly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wall while I got my bearings . Now I knew I 'd been too long with the taMings . I had n't just begun to forget who I really was , I 'd actually begun to hate myself . It must be catching . I pulled up my collar as I moved away from the station steps . I almost thought I could still smell the sea bottom , that stench and tang I used to catch a whiff of sometimes in Oldcity , when an accidental breath of real sea air found its way inside . But the sea bottom was buried under monomole and composite . It was only my imagination , trying to make something better of the stale smell of sweat and urine . This was the place I wanted , the station called Free Market Square . Argentyne and the players had described it to me , filling in holes in each others ' knowledge until my own mental map was as clear as I could make it . The warren of streets around the Tube stop entrance was at the heart of the Lack Market @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " Anything you want . " Representatives ready to provide the kinds of services the combines liked to pretend did n't exist any more cruised the open square , mingling with bodies looking for those services and with other bodies that were only here because they did n't have anywhere else to go .  | I froze suddenly , staring out across the crowds . Someone was moving through them , coming toward the station entrance  --  someone I recognized . Stryger . He was cloaked , and surrounded by followers but no media that I could see . Nobody else even looked at him twice . I stepped behind a peeling ad kiosk , keeping out of sight as I watched him pass . I brushed his thoughts , wondering what the hell he could possibly want from a place like this . Hoping it was dirty . He glanced over his shoulder , looking back the way he 'd come . He felt pity , and satisfaction . . . but that was all . One of the shelters his money had paid for was right here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ End on his own , to see for himself what kind of job it was doing . That was the only reason he 'd come here . There was nothing else on his mind right now ; not the Assembly vote , not the Council slot , not genocide . . . . I watched him disappear into the Tube station , while a kind of numbness spread inside me . Once all he 'd wanted was to do that kind of good . Maybe there was even some part of him that still wanted it . I tried to imagine him that way , the way everyone else saw him  --  controlling the kind of money and power he did , and using it only for good . It made me feel lousy . I pushed out of my hiding place and moved on into the crowd . Vendors had set up stalls or just squatted on the pavement with food and wares spread out around them , interrupting the flow of foot traffic . Their shrill cries and blaring music drowned out the murmured queries , the muttered answers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that sometimes the Corpses put in an appearance , just to keep things orderly ; I did n't see any out now . It was just like Oldcity : all they cared about was appearances , anyway . They were out of their depth here , literally and figuratively , and they knew it . You could do or buy anything down here , as long as you did it by the numbers . I took my left hand out of my pocket and caught hold of my collar : a sign that I was looking for drugs . I left it clenched there as I found the nerve to push out into the sea of grotesques and hunters and derelicts . I saw other seekers with a fist clenched over a collar ; some of the fists were real white-knuckled . There were hands locked behind backs , hands clutching the opposite wrist , hands speaking in silent gestures against a thigh , all sending out different messages to whoever was interested . If you did n't know the codes you could walk here for hours and never get a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signs were different from the ones I knew , but in subtle  | ways . Prying into thoughts as I passed , I checked the codes against their meanings , learning , remembering . If I made clumsy mistakes somebody might not notice ; but then again , somebody might . . . . I dodged past something human the size of a horse , that was leading a half-naked burnout on a chain . One after another , dealers came up to me , offering me the usual street shit . They all shook their heads when I said what I wanted . All of them knew the names Argentyne had told me to use , the ones Daric did his major business with , but none of them would admit it . Some of them turned around and walked away from me like I was poison when they heard ; but some of them just looked silent , and then went away to check . I should have known none of them would trust me on sight  --  they could n't read my mind . Daric usually met with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . halfway between his world and theirs . They would n't circulate personally in this crowd . So all I could do was wait , and hope one of them was interested enough to send for me . I kept moving , to fend off the pickpockets and beggars and sellers trying to sell me things I did n't want to buy . A skinny kid with a runny nose and an ugly scar across one eye , a skinnier little girl dragging behind him , whined and pulled at my sleeve , " Please , mister , please ? " I started to pull away ; did n't . I felt in my pockets for the markers I always carried , a habit left from the days when my wrist was as bare as his . I gave him a handful . He disappeared , but someone else was there to fill the hole he left before I could take a step , and someone else after her and someone else , until I 'd emptied my pockets of everything . When they saw I was n't giving any more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ markers , leaving me space to move on . There were some kinds of holes you could never fill ; even if your credit never ran dry . I glanced at my databand , swearing as I saw the time . I looked up , but there was nothing to see  --  the dome high above me was invisible against the sea . The sky was a deep green suffusion of light reflected from the streetlamp stars . That was all the higher your hopes ever went in a place like this . I wondered what the Deep End looked like from above , to the strange creatures swimming outside . At least I still had my databand ; in a crowd like this , that was something . I wore a thumblock on it , because I knew how easy the usual latch was to unscramble . I leaned against a lightpost at the edge of the square and shook  | out my hand , which was getting numb from hanging on my collar . I felt tired and strung out ; every second that winked past as I watched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of these streets , behind some door with heavier security than most combine embassies carried , there was somebody in a black lab making just what I wanted , or somebody willing to front it to me . I began to wonder why nobody had come back , whether there was something going on that maybe Argentyne had n't even known about , that was keeping me from getting what I needed . Some mistake I was making ; some secret , some hidden trouble . I wanted to go find out . Except that if I was right , pushing on into those strange green streets alone might be the worst thing I could do . Maybe it would get the attention of the right people . Maybe it would just get the wrong ones . Why the hell could n't anything ever be simple ? ? My head wanted to hurt again . I pressed my fingers against my temples , trying to will the pain to stop . " Hey , hotpants , come with us . We 'll give you everything you 're asking for , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back as the gang of half a dozen bully bitches gathered around me . The stink of leather and pheromone perfume made my stomach turn over . Their leader pinned me up against the lightpost , her metal-studded fingers grabbing at my crotch . " You like to party rough , huh baby ? " Her fist closed over my balls . " So do we . " I swore with the pain , and knocked her hand away . " Back off . I did n't ask for sex . I 'm looking for something else . " " Then why were you signalling for sex , sweetmeat ? " Her hand mimicked the way I 'd been rubbing my head . She caught me by the front of my jacket . " I get it , you just want to play hard-to-get . . . ? " She jerked me forward and slapped me . I slapped her back , knew it for a mistake as her gang moved in on me . Hands in chainmail and leather pinned me up against the pole while she slapped me again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the garbage , dazed , as they let me go . She jerked a lipstain out of the ancient cartridge belt slung across her chest . Her own mouth twisting , she pulled it open and smeared it across my mouth . The rest of the gang followed her away into the crowd . I hauled myself up again , wiped my face on my jacket sleeve , wincing as I ran into buckles . I only managed to smear the dark leather with lipstain , and with blood from the place where she 'd laid open  | my cheek . The crowd just kept flowing past , like nothing unusual had happened . Nothing unusual had . " Hey , kid ? " A heavy , stubble-bearded face pushed in front of mine , blocking my way as I started forward . He was half a head taller than me and twice as wide , dressed in dark , flapping clothes . I braced , ready for another mistake , wondering what the hell I 'd done to attract the wrong attention this time . But he laughed at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face looked  --  and said , " I hear you 're looking for Venk . " " Yeah , " I said , trying to keep the sudden screaming relief out of it . He was real . He knew Venk , worked for him . " What 's it worth to you ? " I held up my wrist , let him see my credit line . " I can make it worth his time . " " Why do you want to see him ? " " That 's personal . " He already knew the answer . It was tough playing headgames when my own head was still ringing . " Then how do I know Venk can help you ? " He kept pushing .. . he wanted my source . I wiped my smarting cheek again . " Dark taMing sent me . You want to deal , or not ? " " Follow me . " He started away before I could say anything more . I followed him . It took all my concentration to keep from losing him in the crowd . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like I needed him more than he needed me . He was probably right . But a part of his mind was keeping track of me behind him even while he pretended he was n't  --  and he was subvocalizing to somebody somewhere ahead of us . He led me away from the station , out of the square . We headed down one of the murky streets full of hidden specialties that waited beyond the lights and noise . It was a relief to get out of the square alive ; but the relief only lasted until I could n't hear the crowd noise behind me any more . I realized that there 'd been a kind of invisible field around Free Market Square . Nothing tangible , just a kind of attitude , an unspoken threat , that kept the outsiders in . On this street there was nobody moving who did n't belong here , and who was n't being tracked through a hundred windows , visible and invisible . Outsider . The featureless , prefab building walls whispered it , reaching up into the eerie gloom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fifty meters above . A luminous  | grid of geodesic lines glowed faintly , marking the inverse line of sea and sky like electric fishnet . . . all that separated us from the fish . I felt tension settling on me like a weight , until it was hard to breathe . . . realized suddenly that it was n't just my imagination . " Hey , " I called . My guide slowed , turning back to look at me . " This is n't the way to Venk 's . Where you taking me ? " He shrugged . " Venk 's orders . He 's gon na meet you down by the Locks instead . " " The Locks ? " I repeated , picking an image out of his mind . The edge of town , here in the Deep End . Where divers went out to tend maintenance or seafarms . . . where they got rid of their garbage . But Venk was going to be there , waiting for me . That was what he 'd been told , and he believed it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't say . " He started on . I followed him wordlessly . Where they got rid of their garbage . This whole thing felt bad , felt worse with every step . I wanted to stop , turn back  --  but it was too late now . We kept walking , mods and ground trams slipping silently past , other pedestrians looking at us sidelong as we got closer to the end of the line . The shining grid of the sky arced down to meet us as we came out on a kind of quay . You actually could smell the sea here , where clusters of airlocks lined the wall , in sizes running from single-occupant to gigantic , their designation data glowing patiently in the green gloom . I could see strange shadows moving beyond the dome wall ; natives of the other side , or divers invading their space . It was hard to see much beyond the dome , but somewhere out in the murky darkness I thought I saw lights . There were separate little blister worlds out there in the bay that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even the Deep End had to offer . The quay at the end of the street was empty ; too empty . Nothing moved anywhere nearby , on the open dockyards , between the gapingmouthed warehouses . It took a minute for my mind to find the lone figure waiting near the black mouth of one of them . Venk came forward slowly , his bodyguard glowing faintly in the dim light , until I could make out his face , and he could make out mine . I felt the shock of recognition as he registered my features . " 1 saw you on the threedy , " he whispered . I wondered why he was whispering . " Daric sent you to find me . . . ? " he asked , his voice dragging a strange accent . " Yeah , " I said , groping with my mind . My skin prickled as I  | kit the images begin to harden suddenly behind his eyes . Ship " I need sonic . . . . " " No , " he whispered . He wiped his nose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He turned as Venk moved , his own hand rising I kicked out , hit his arm with my foot just before the beam of hot light lanced out of his sleeve . Pain branded my side as the white heat punched a hole in my jacket . I kicked him again , hit body armor where his balls should have been . I threw myself at him , because he was expecting me to run , and knocked him down . His head cracked hard on the pavement . I scrambled up . And then I ran like hell , away from the lone figure glowing like a haunt on the too-silent quay and whatever lightning he was calling down on me . I made the end of the street , luckier than I 'd ever thought I 'd be  --  Venk 's man was n't wearing heatseekers . I saw a tram waiting at the turnaround and bolted for it , yelling . It jerked forward and drifted away , picking up speed as it left me behind . . . on purpose . I slowed , panting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked through me like I was invisible . Or marked . They disappeared into the shadows , into doorways , melting away from me without seeming to . I ran on down the street , my heart hammering , letting my mind search ahead and behind for hunters . Wondering how far I was going to get , wondering what I 'd done to make Daric 's dealerman want to kill me . I tried to remember when I 'd felt as stupid , or as scared . I did n't think they 'd waste me in the middle of the street , even here . Hell , I was a fucking media star . But if they could n't they 'd take me someplace where they could . And then the Locks would be waiting . Behind me now I felt three minds converge , searching for me . Up ahead there were three more , moving in to cut me off . I dodged into a side street as I saw the shadows start to take form . I felt like I was swimming through the green light , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shape ? I heard myself laugh , a gasp of noise , as some part of my mind drifted free inside a bubble of panic , rising up toward somewhere outside of reality . Light leaked through the sudden gap of a barely-open gate , catching my eye . I crashed through it , not caring what was on the other side . I collided with something  --  someone , almost knocking him down in a tangle of rough white robes . " Huh , " I wheezed , half a question , and half a gasp of relief . A prayer meeting . My night eyes made out some kind of cult objects on an altar ; a cluster of figures all wearing white , none of them expecting me , looking for me , hunting me.  | There were curses and gasps as hands reached out to steady me ? frisked me , and then jerked my arms apart until I was spread-eagled between them like a prisoner . Light flared , blinding me . The hard , tattooed faces closing in on me as my sight cleared did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started to struggle , and somebody hit me in the stomach . I went down , helpless , as they let me go . Doubled over on the floor , I heard a wailing moan that did n't sound human , heard it shape itself into words : " A sacrament ! Fresh wine for the cups of the Souldrinker ? " Heard the clip of a knifespring . My head jerked back as someone 's hands braced it . The knifeblade flashed in the light , arcing down toward my chest . I threw up my hands , screamed as pain slashed through my palm , and my own blood spurted into my face . The sound of a stungun fired too close to my ear tore my senses apart , and all at once there was more shouting , more swearing , as the number of bodies in the space around me suddenly doubled . The whiterobes scattered , screaming the name of the Souldrinker into the night  --  leaving me on the ground in a forest of dark , armored legs . More hands hauled me up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead end claimed what was left of me for themselves . I LET THEM THINK I could n't walk because I could n't walk , telling myself while they dragged me back out to the street that I was just waiting for the right chance to make a break for it . . . . Someone stood waiting for us in the dimly-lit throat of a building  | across the way . Ile was n't glowing ; was n't shielded . Was n't the same one , not Venk , that I 'd left standing on the pier . " Ilullo , Cat , " he said . The two men who 'd been dragging me stopped , letting him take a look at me , letting me look at him . He knew me ; he thought I knew hint . " There was something vaguely familiar about his voice , but I was sure I 'd never seen that face before . A light chip flickered in his palm , showing me his features in sudden clear detail : Young-old , bronzeskinned , with a sharp nose and hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was wearing body armor like the rest , but his face shield was up so that I could see him . The silver ring through the left nostril of his nose winked in the light . " Know me now ? " I shook my head , my brain still strobing back to the image of a knifeblade coming down , again and again .... " No , " I mumbled , wondering why he did n't just kill me and get it over with . His thin mouth quirked . Slowly he lifted a hand , pulled off his studded glove . There was a white band of scar ringing his wrist , just like there was around my own . " Now ? " I shut my eyes for a second , listening to the voice of his mind . Mikah . I looked up at his face again , with a kind of disbelief . The last time I 'd seen that face we 'd both still worn the bond tags that had left those scars . " Mikah . " I 'd never seen his face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blue with radioactive dust , or wasted with sickness . We 'd been work partners , never friends ; in the Mines it did n't take long before there was n't enough left of you to make any effort at all . But he 'd seen me escape , leaving him behind wearing a death sentence . And the look on his face had eaten into my memory , until I 'd had to do something to get it out of my dreams . " What are you doing here ? " I said , my voice sounding like something squeezed out of a child . " Have n't you figured it out ? " he asked , like I 'd missed the punch line of a joke . " Shit , kid , I 'm here to save your ass . " He came forward , handed the light chip to one of the other men as he looked me over . " Got your pupils fixed , huh ? " His smile stretched a little wider at my grimace . His hand caught my wrist in a loose grip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notice as my blood began to run down his arm . I swore as I got a real look at the wound . The knife was still jutting out of my palm . It had gone clear through . Suddenly the light seemed too golden ; I felt like I was sinking into honey . Mikah 's dark eyes came back to mine , but they were n't expres- sionless now . His smile disappeared . You . . . " he said , shaking his head . " It was you bought off my contract , and sent money for the meds to clean out my lungs , and enough left over to let me make a start ? " His grip on my wrist tightened . " And you never told me why . Why ? Why 'd you do that ? ? " I winced ; his hand loosened suddenly . I did n't say anything , because I could n't think of an answer that would have made any sense . His free hand rose , closed over the knife hilt . His grip on me tightened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said . I looked up , and he jerked the knife free . My vision went red , and I cried out again ; choked it off , because half a dozen men who did this to strangers all the time were staring at me . I took long , shuddering breaths while he peeled the glove off my bleeding hand . When I could focus again I saw Mikah nod slightly , saw a faint smile pull at the corners of his mouth again . He dropped my bloodsoaked glove on the floor . Then , silently , solemnly , he took the blade he 'd pulled out of me and laid it down across his own palm . " Nobody ever did anything for me , " he whispered . His eyes never left my face . " Not my own family . Nobody except you . " His jaw tightened as he pressed down with the blade , and blood welled out suddenly , pooling in his cupped hand . He lifted his palm and pressed it against mine , folding his fingers over my hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Anything you ever want  --  anything  --  you can ask me . You understand , brother ? " I nodded slowly . He let go of me . Pulling loose one of the long colored scarves he wore around his throat , he wrapped it tightly around my palm ; wrapped his own hand with another one . I looked at my hand . " I want to sit down , " I mumbled . He grinned . " You got it . " Shoring me up with an arm around my waist , he led me back out to the main street and down a few doors to the entrance of a bar . The other men followed us , flanked me , easy but watchful in the way they moved . It finally began to sink into my brain that they were all his men , following his orders . " Somebody 's trying to kill me ? " I said , shaking my head , as Mikah tried to force me toward the bright , loud doorway . His razor smile came back . " Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jerked my head back the way we 'd come . " Somebody else . " He snorted . " You do n't waste much time , do you ? " He pushed me forward into the open arms of light and noise . " Not any more , "  | he repeated , as I dropped like a sack onto the bench in the closest empty booth . " You got Family now . " He signed to the soldiers with him : they nodded and faded into the background noise . Ile sat down across the laminated tabletop from me , propped on his elbows ; spoke an order for drinks into the waiter on the wall . " Jeezu , " I said thickly . " Where the hell did you come from ? " It was n't cold here , but I was shivering . He waved a hand . " Hey . I was born here . I work here now . I used the credit line you left me to buy into a Family . " He laughed . " What did you expect me to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up . I shook my head . " Good prospects for advancement . " He nodded away into the room , where his men were sitting around a table , tossing Cubes . " Got my own squad already . " The drinks he 'd ordered flipped out of the wall . He pushed one of them at me . I shook my head , watching whitish froth form a crust on its rim . " Drink it , " he said . " It 's only bicarb . " I drank it , grateful . " What 's your specialty ? " Wondering if I 'd be sorry I asked . " Whatever makes a profit this week . " He shrugged . " Mostly security and protection . " I thought about it . " All that still does n't explain how you just happened to be there in time to protect my ass . I do n't have that kind of luck . " He laughed again . " Saw you on the Morning Report , hero . " He gulped down half of his own drink . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had you traced . I wanted to . . . square things . I did n't figure I 'd get to start this fast . " " Who were those crazy bastards ? " " Rippers . . . a cult gang . Eat your heart out  --  literally . " I looked away , feeling my face get clammy . " Argentyne told me I was being an asshole . " I cradled my throbbing hand inside the good one . The shock was wearing off ; I felt like I 'd picked up a handful of hot coals . And could n't put them down . I damped out the pain receptors in my brain with an effort . " I thought I knew the rules . " " Argentyne ? The symbplayer ? You know her ? " I looked up as I felt the flash of unguarded excitement run through him , before his control dropped on it again . With the part of my mind that was still functioning , I realized that I 'd impressed him . " A little . " He leaned back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me know that . " She puts me on overload with her socketwork. "  | " Yeah , " I said . " She 's a nova . " I made a picture of her in my mind , letting it warm me up . He shrugged . " I like her work . She 's not my type . " I glanced up again , surprised . " You do n't look dead to me . " He laughed . " You do n't like women . " Realizing half a beat late what the total lack of heat when he thought about her meant . " Not in my bed .... You got a problem with that ? " His face hardened over at the expression I felt spread across my own . " No . " I shook my head . " I 'm a freak , who am I to criticize anybody ? . . . I was just wondering how come you never tried to hit on me down in the mines . " I realized again , more strongly , what total strangers we were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he even had one . I looked down at my hand , at the blood oozing through the layers of cloth . Blood brother . I started to shiver again . " I was too fucking tired and sick . " He looked at me , a slow smile coming out on his face again . " Besides , you 're not my type either , freak . " There was no sting in it ; the truth , and nothing more . But he trusted me  --  that I would n't try to touch him with my mind ? because I 'd never hit on him , either . " So , this is where I am , now , " he said . " What the hell are you doing down under , besides trying to commit suicide ? You looked like you had everything you needed , up there on the wall this morning . Bodyguard to a vip  --  nice work , if you can get it . " " I got a drug problem . Not the usual kind ? " I said , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could n't help thinking how much easier it would all be if I could just set it whole into someone else 's brain ; if only there was n't so much fear . " And Venk tried to null you , when you told him Daric taMing sent you ? " Mikah frowned . I nodded . " He recognized me , from the news . " Trying to make that make some kind of sense with the rest of it , because somehow it had seemed to be a step on the path . Nothing at all made much sense to me right now . Mikah rubbed his head . " Beats the crap out of me . He 's not crazy . If he tried to kill you , he had a good reason .... " He stared at his half-empty cup , glanced up at me again . " You want me to find out what it is ? " " Yeah . Especially if it 's a good one . " I hesitated . " And ? " " Get you the drugs . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He finished his drink , swept the cup into the dump along the  | wall of ' the booth . " Conte on . That 's not a drink of ' water you 're looking for . I 'd better take you to see the Doctor . " " I do n't need a ? " " He 's not that kind of doctor . " A thin smile . " Doctor Death . Runs a black lab . " I grimaced . " His real name 's DeAth . Fits him better this way , though . " He stood up . " I 'm not looking for poison , " I said sourly . But maybe I was . " Too bad . He 's got the best . He supplies most of the big Families with the specialties they need for their hire business . " The Lack Market had its combines too ; but working for them was a lot more personal . Mikah signaled his soldiers . " He 's got the best of everything . He can fix you up . " I followed him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public phone in the entryway . He touched in a silent code , got a query symbol on a blank screen . He fed in another code . This time he got a single line of letters : THE DOCTOR IS IN . He glanced back at me . " You do n't see him without an appointment . " We took the Tube a couple of stops deeper into the Deep End , and a tram to a quiet streetcorner . The buildings wore more flash here , the streets were cleaner and had a more exclusive feel than the ones around Free Market Square . The only people who came calling here knew exactly where they were going . Mikah led me on down the street to the sixth rowhouse . Its door was black ; ornate grillwork crawled like a vine up the walls , covered with black iron leaves . Mikah stepped up on the porch , signaling me to join him ; his gang sauntered away down the street , back the way we 'd come . I watched them go , wishing they 'd stayed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his hands held out and open , away from his sides . I did the same , figuring we did n't need to knock to let anybody know we were here . After a minute the door opened , letting us in . There was nobody waiting . We walked down a long hallway with mirrored walls . " Getting sanitized , " Mikah said . By now I was almost beyond caring who or what was on the other side . The doorway opened at the end of the hall , and we were in the black lab of Doctor Death . " Hello ! " a cheerful voice called , and somebody came toward us through the maze of scopes , electronic cookers , and data screens that covered an entire building floor . I watched a good-looking woman  | disappear through a doorway at the far side of the lab . The man was squat and round-faced , wearing lab pastels , his bald head gleaming in the brilliant light . He had two sets of eyes . The extra set looked like they belonged to some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stopped in front of Mikah , beaming up at us , his gloved hands clasped and shining like water . " What can I do for you boys ? " he asked , with a shopkeeper 's eager smile . " Some Family business ? " It was Doctor Death . I stared at him , trying not to . I realized I 'd come expecting somebody who lived up to the name . Not somebody who looked like he ought to be minding a bar somewhere , telling jokes . Except for the eyes . " Uh .. . " I said . " He wants topalase-AC . " Mikah said . " You got any of that ? " " Topalase-AC ? " DeAth said , with his invisible eyebrows going up . " What in God 's name does he want that for ? He wants to become a mass murderer , but he has n't got the nerve ? " Mikah did n't say anything , so finally I said , " I want to be able to act . . . human . " DeAth looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bug-eyes . " That 's an ambiguous response , if I ever heard one . So , well , I know , it 's none of your business , old man . ' It 's just a shame , when a kid comes in here looking to ruin his life . But I just make the stuff , how you use it is your business .... " His hand was already dancing over a touchboard while he spoke , calling up data . " I have it on hand , if you 've got the price . " I could tell it really broke his heart to sell it to me . I winced at the price I saw on the screen . But I nodded . I put in a clearance on my databand , transferring the sum to him . " I 'll be back . " He turned , trotting away toward the door that the woman had disappeared through . I took a step , half afraid he was going to leave and never come back . But Mikah caught my arm . " He 'll be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " the lab 's armed . " I stayed where I was , and waited . DeAth came back , in less time than it seemed like . He held out a sheet of stick-ons to me . I put my hand out , so eager to get hold of it that for half a second I forgot what I 'd done to myself . DeAth 's arm jerked back in a startle-reflex . " Yik , " he said , his lip curling as he saw the bloodsoaked cloth wrapping my hand . I wondered how he 'd react if he ever got to see what his chemicals did to other people . Like the kind of thing that had happened at Elnear 's  | party last night . . . . Ile slapped the paper into my other palm . " Please go , before you contaminate my rug . Goodbye . " He herded us hack out into the mirrored hallway ; the inner door sealed shut with a hiss behind us . There was a rushing in my ears as I peeled one of the blood-red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one-handed . Mikah watched me like he 'd watch a junkie , but all he said was , " You better get that wound fixed . " I shrugged , hardly thinking about it as I stuffed the sheet of drugs inside my jacket . " Do n't worry about it , everything 's fine now .... " In a few more minutes all the walls in my mind would be down at last , and I 'd be able to see forever . He stopped , pushed me up against the minors . I stared at the two of us reflecting back and forth into infinity as he shook me once . " You hear what I said ? " His voice was as hard as a fist . He took my wounded hand and slammed it back against the mirror ; I gasped with the pain of it . " That 's a bad cut . Get it fixed , freak . " I grunted and nodded as the pain cleared out my head . " I hear you . " I took a deep breath , looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let go of me and turned away as the front door opened , like an impatient arm urging us out . When we were out in the street again I said , " What happened at Lady Elnear 's party last night looked like a hire job to me . That the kind of thing DeAth does ? " Mikah nodded . " Yeah . That was slick . He could have supplied it . " He looked ahead , not taking it past an idle guess . His soldiers were around us again , from somewhere , nowhere . " Can you find out ? " He glanced at me . " Maybe . I 'll work on it . " " I want to know why somebody down here wants her out . Or who 's paying them . " He nodded . " Right . " We walked on in silence . " I 'll be in touch , " he said , as he left me at the Tube again . " Take care of yourself , brother . " I lifted my bloody hand , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I could n't remember when I 'd felt better . " YOU LOOK LIKE A SPOTLIGHT . I guess you got what you wanted , " Argentyne said , her gaze locked on my face as she opened the door . She stepped back , stared at my bloodstained clothes as she let me past into the club . The ends of her mouth pulled down . " Mother Earth ... I guess you got what you were asking for , too . " I shook my head ; not denying it , just trying to shake loose the feeling that I was really everybody within a hundred meters of me . I focused on her relief turning into disgust , relief , worry , disgust ... . damped it down further until I was only myself again . " Yeah , " I said , following her back inside . There were a few customers hanging out already , scattered in clumps around the room , but at least I 'd made it back before the evening really started . I was n't sure I could have handled that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that all you 've got to say ? " she asked , too sharply , when that was all I said . " Sorry , " I mumbled . " This takes some getting used to . Strong stuff . " I touched my head . " Got ta get my clothes and go . " " They 're upstairs . I 'll put some sudoskin on that hand for you ; it looks pretty shitty . " " Thanks . " Now that I was back inside my body , I was discovering again that it hurt like bloody hell in a couple of places . I followed her upstairs , into the long , wide room that was her private apartment . It was almost large enough to hold everything she wanted to have  | around her , stuffed into dressers and chests . The rest of it was sorted into vague heaps on top of pieces of furniture . Some of the furniture looked like it had been around a lot longer than she had . Clothes and ornaments hung from everything that would hold them , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floor below the windows . Some kind of animal with reddish fur scuttled off the bed and into a closet as we entered the room . " Do n't mind the mess , " she said , because I was probably staring . " I just ca n't seem to throw anything out . I guess it 's because for a long time I did n't have anything to throw out . " I nodded , feeling in my pocket for the markers I 'd given away . " Hard to break old habits , " I said . " Sit down . " She smiled finally , picking a pack of camphs off a dressertop and putting one into her mouth . She held out the pack to me . I had n't had one in years ; not since Dere Cortelyou had died . They always made me think of him . But tonight all my memories seemed far away . I nodded , grateful , and she flipped me one . She was wearing loose gray pants now , tied at the ankles ; a blue shirt with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rolled up . Her earrings were the size of eggs , and silver . I stuck the camph into my mouth and bit down on the end of it , feeling it deaden my tongue with ice and spice as I sucked on it ; letting it calm my nerves . I sighed , sitting on the edge of the bed , because it was the only place left in the room where you could sit . It felt so good I could have gone to sleep right there , sitting up , if my body had n't felt so bad . My hand throbbed and burned ; so did my side , now . I pulled back the leather jacket , pulled up the blood-splattered shirt under it . Beneath the fresh burn holes in both of them was the burn on my side where the hole had just missed going through me too . " Shit . . . . " I said , not sure if it was because of what had happened , or what had n't . " Jeezu , " Argentyne murmured . " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ robbery ? " She sat down beside me with a firstaid box . I laughed once , shook my head . " Daric 's dealerman tried to kill me . I think I got in the way of something more than a gun . You know anything you did n't tell me ? " She half frowned , shaking her own head . " No . But with Daric , you never know everything . . . . " She looked tired suddenly . " I 'm sorry . Take your coat off . I 'll plaster that one too . " She popped the kit open .  | " It 's clean , it 'll heal over by itself . " " Do n't be stupid . " She helped me get out of the jacket without moving too much . " Sorry I ruined the clothes . I 'll pay you for them . " " Do n't be stupid , " she said again . She pulled my shirt up . Her hand froze suddenly ; she was staring at old scars . She let the shirt drop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Do you like pain ? " I grimaced , startled . " I try like hell to keep away from it . " I shrugged . " Sometimes you just ca n't .... " She looked down again , as if she was embarrassed . She took the can of sudoskin out of the box and sprayed it on my side . Then she was unwrapping the cloth around my hand , biting hard on her own camph to steady her nerves . She looked at the wound , looked away again , her face twisting . My hand was still bleeding . I looked away too . " I ca n't deal with that , " she said , shaking her head . " Let me get Aspen  --  he 'd better do it for you . He used to be a med student , until he found out he did n't like sick people . " She stood up . " I can go to the meds . " She looked back at me . " And what are you going to tell them when they ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smiled . " I could tell them the same thing I told Braedee , when he asked me how I got that way last night . " She made a rude noise , and went out of the room . I fumbled for the leather jacket to get out the sheet of drugs . It slid off onto the floor . I kneeled down to pick it up ; glanced into the low , flat cave underneath the bedframe . Sometimes having better sight than anyone else is n't something you 're glad of . Someone else probably would never have noticed what I saw lying there in the darkness . But I saw it , and knew what it was . And then I saw something else , and something else : things that had never been intended to do anything but inflict pain . I pushed to my feet , holding the jacket ; turned toward the door , feeling like I just wanted to get the hell out of there . But Argentyne was already back , with one of the players who had a shining touchboard for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strangely , because she thought I was looking at her strangely . I sat down again , and held out my hand . Aspen took it , turned it , flexed the fingers , very carefully . " Tried to shake hands with a mugger , huh ? Can you use it at all ? "  | Not right now , " I said irritably , thinking that much ought to he obvious . " Hm . " He frowned , suddenly turning professional ; not easy when he looked like a floor lamp . " Let me get my own kit ; I 've got to suture this . " He drifted out of the room again , humming faintly , accompanied by synth sounds . One half of his brain was reviewing a medical procedure , while the other half was composing music . " Why did you look at me like that ? " Argentyne asked , as soon as he was out of earshot . I hesitated . " I saw what 's under the bed . " Her face did n't redden through the silver of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heat behind it . " Dark , " I said . " Dark ? ? " Not even sure what the emotion was that closed around my stomach like a fist . " You let that bastard do that to you ? " " No ! " She swore . " No , " looking down suddenly , " I do it to him . " " Why ? ? " I said , but before it was even out of my mouth , 1 saw the answer . " Because you love him . " The words were so hard to say they were barely audible . She raised her head . " You said it to Jiro last night , did n't you ? It 's better if you get it from someone who cares about you . ' ... " If I tried hard enough , I could almost make myself believe that . She turned away to the dresser , pulled another camph out of the pack . She glanced up , staring at my reflection in the mirror , so that she did n't have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yeah , " she whispered . " I mean . . . he hates himself so much , and I do n't know why . Sometimes he scares me . I do it because if I did n't , God knows where he 'd go to get it , or what would happen to him then .... " She slammed her hands down on the dressertop , making trays of body paint and makeup jump , hurting herself . " Everything okay ? " Aspen asked , coming back through the doorway carrying a portable surgery . " Your timing is just perfect , " Argentyne said wearily , turning to look at us again . " Hey , thanks . " He sat down on the bed , thumbing the case open . " I 've really been working on it . " He patted his glowing chest ; notes floated up like bubbles .
