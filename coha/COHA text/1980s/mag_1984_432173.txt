 | Sixty years ago the woman who would redefine the art of dance left the Denishawn Company to make her solo debut . At the time it could not have looked very auspicious : she had what was called the " art spot " on the program of the " Greenwich Village Follies , " and a highlight of her performance was a drapery-laden evocation of the mysterious East set to " Pale Hands I Loved Beside the Shalimar . " But the reviews were good , and within a few years she had dropped her pseudo-Oriental exotica and begun to build the austere and vivid imagery synonymous with her name . Martha Graham will celebrate her 90th birthday this spring , with new choreography and a company tour . But in many ways this will be a celebration for modern dance itself . The once daring vocabulary of movement Graham developed early in the century has become part of the daily routine of dancers all over the world ; whether they use it or rebel against it , young performers and choreographers absorb her technical innovations right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On her most expert dancers the technique can still look explosive : to see these torsos clenched and then ardently released , this coiling on the floor , the upward spirals that propel a dancer from kneeling to exulting , the wave after wave ofjumps that touch earth briefly in a crouch and are airborne again is to marvel once more at a new way of moving . Graham 's legacy is ineradicable , but the ovation that greeted the opening of her current season at the New York State Theater was a more satisfying tribute to the past than to the present . To be sure , the dances Graham has been making recently hardly reflect the quiet musings of a placid old age . A graphic homosexual fantasy sparks the anguish in " Phaedra 's Dream , " which was first presented at the Athens Festival last summer and given its New York premiere this season . Three archetypal Graham figures engage in passion-drenched combat : Phaedra @# ( Christine Dakin ) , who pursues her stepson Hippolytus ( Jean-Louis Morin ) , who is in turn pursued by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems to have assembled this dance , like others in the last decade , by stringing together quotes from her repertoire : the hungry stares , wide-flung legs and emotional seizures that have characterized her heroines for years . But the time is long past when a story rendered solely in these terms can avoid bombast ? passion just does n't look like that anymore . For her major new work this season , Graham turned to Stravinsky 's " The Rite of Spring . " Choreographers before her have been attracted to what she has called " terrifying and hallowed ground , " and most have gone down in defeat . Graham 's version is a stark , abstract recital of the sacrifice , with a victim plucked from the corps and drawn gradually toward acquiescence in her death , as groups of men and women provide a choruslike background of awe , agony and compliance . The sense of a powerful terror gaining control of the victim and leading her to doom is projected in high color , thanks to Graham 's still avid theatricality . Red Ribbon : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " has not been choreographed with a profundity equal to the music . Terese Capucilli writhes energetically enough as the victim , but her distress lies on the surface . This is terror displayed , not personified ; from the choreographer who once gave us Medea extracting the red ribbon of death from her own throat , the difference is vivid . For all the shuddering , racking and mourning that goes on in this " Rite of Spring , " there is little of the pounding inevitability that carries Graham 's great @# @#  | tragedies to their conclusions and does so in the unabashed language of movement . after a while , the participants in this ritual seem to be stalling , as if they have to tell and retell their grief until they hear the end of the music approaching and can bring their story to a climax . More than half a century separates these new works from " Primitive Mysteries , " Graham 's 1931 masterpiece , yet there 's nothing dated about this radiant , revelatory dance ? the earliest piece seen this season . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Southwest in 1930 , and the Spanish-Indian religious cults of that region inspired some of her most splendid work . ' Primitive Mysteries " is made for three groups of women , dressed in blue , who surround a figure formally wrapped in white ? Takako Asakawa , on opening night . She might be a young innocent , or the Virginthe dance is divided into sections called ' Hymn to the Virgin , " " Crucifixus " and " Hosanna " ? or she might be prayer itself . Serene and obedient , the women almost always move in unison , and the gentle rhythms that carry them from one formation to the next seem to rise and fall like the breath of the dance made visible . Madness : More elaborate works in the repertoire , however , such as Graham 's portrayals of myth and madness , almost never strike with their original vigor these days . Without Graham 's once powerful personal influence in the studio ? her control has waned in the last 25 years ? the dancers tend to handle her classic gestures as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the floor are cushioned now ; hips that used to jut forward impetuously are placed daintily in position , and contractions designed to grip the dancer 's gut have become fragile curves of the torso . Compelling passages remain ? Joan of Arc 's angry , fearful submission to her destiny in " Seraphic Dialogue " came alive , for example , in Jacqulyn Buglisi 's handling of the seductive sword ? but much of the language has grown melodramatic from lack of conviction . " I am certain , " wrote Martha Graham in 1941 , " that movement never lies . " Unhappily , that truth is revealed by the remnants of her style now on display . Perhaps inevitably , her ideas about movement have been so thoroughly domesticated by generations of use that they no longer have the power to amaze us . Yet the dances themselves , with their invigorating theatrical energy and brilliant stagecraft , might have survived more successfully if Graham and her supporters had been seriously committed to the faithful preservation of her work . To show its allegiance to Graham , her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to praise her new dances as if they were equal to the old , and to accept the disintegration of technique in her company . We have no other way , it seems , to let genius rest , and no way to keep a great legacy with us except by ignoring its frailty . @#
