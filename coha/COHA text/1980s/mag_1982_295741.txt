As unforgiving as this year 's outlook is , the prospect of a prosperous selling season was even dimmer 49 years ago , when Sears , Roebuck &; Co. published its first Christmas catalogue . In that Depression year , unemployment was almost 25% , and the Sears " wish " book carried the blue eagle of the National Recovery Administration on its cover . The dollar as we know it today was worth $7.58 . <P> The catalogue , 88 pages mostly in grim black and white , in contrast to this Christmas ' 648 pages nearly all in color , was reprinted by Sears as a promotion . Then , as now , concern about prices seemed paramount . The catalogue promised nifty bargains to customers who made a $7.50 purchase-for example , a 26-piece silver-plate tableware set for $4.99 . A number of other items look no less alluring . You needed garters to hold them up , but silk stockings were 78 . In pre-diet conscious America , there were 2-lb. fruitcakes selling for 49 , and 4 Ibs. of mixed nuts cost 79 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a wool sweater for $1.95 . For women , black leather oxfords cost $1.98 , and a one-quarter carat diamond set in 18-karat white gold was priced at $54.50 . <P> But were goods really cheaper ? In 1933 the average annual household income was $32 a week ; in 1981 it was $497 a week . So while the latest-model Kenmore upright vacuum cleaner costs $99.95 now , compared with $17.45 then , it can be paid for with a day 's work , pretax , whereas the 1933 Kenmore cost nearly three days ' salary . The 1982 vacuum cleans better too . Some items even have lower price tags today . Sears does not sell a twelve-tube Superheterodyne console radio any longer , but at $52.95 it could hardly be a match for this year 's $39.95 portable AM-FM that also carries the audio portion of TV channels . Still , the misty veil of nostalgia only enhances the appeal of a Lionel electric train set ( $12.79 ) , all-steel coaster wagon ( $1.98 ) , 26-piece doll-house ( $1.98 ) or 15-in. mohair Teddy bear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ popular then . Big Bill Tilden 's name appeared on a junior tennis racket ( $3.19 ) , and Pitcher Dazzy Vance 's signature was stamped on the horsehide cover of baseballs ( 59 ) . More enduring is the Mickey Mouse watch ( $2.29 ) , though now Mickey tells time with electronic digits ( $16.99 ) instead of white-gloved hands and must compete with Star Wars models . Another big name in the 1933 catalogue was that of Bird Expert H. Fogg , who had just taken charge of Sears ' bird and pet departments and endorsed a line of canaries ( up to $6.95 ) ; these are no longer for sale . Possibly the nearest equivalent in the current edition is the assortment of women 's clothing promoted by Model Cheryl Tiegs.
