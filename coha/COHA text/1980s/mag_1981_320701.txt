Warfare at a " place of killing " <P> It began in a beer hall next to a Zimbabwean army camp with a weekend brawl among soldiers from the country 's two major tribal groups , the Shona and Ndebele . But the fighting , which expanded last week into a fierce factional and tribal war , resulted in more than 100 deaths and dramatized the serious internal conflicts that have continued to plague Prime Minister Robert Mugabe since independence ten months ago . <P> The fighting centered on Bulawayo , the country 's second largest city . It is also one of the main locations where the government has been trying to fuse a national army by integrating the two rival guerrilla forces that fought for independence as the Patriotic Front : the ZANLA forces that were led by Mugabe and are composed mostly of Shona tribesmen ; and the ZIPRA guerrillas , mostly Ndebele , who remain loyal to Joshua Nkomo . As last week 's clashes intensified , ZIPRA and ZANLA units grabbed weapons from the camp 's armory and summoned other former guerrillas to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearby army bases and eventually involved as many as 10,000 troops . <P> For five days , mortar and rifle fire thundered all around Bulawayo ( derived from a Ndebele word and broadly meaning " place of killing " ) . Scores of homes near the camps were damaged by rocket fire . Streams of civilians fled from the confused battle into the nearby bush or to the city center . Shops and schools remained closed in the deserted downtown areas . <P> Responding swiftly , Prime Minister Mugabe called on other national army units to separate the warring troops . <P> Among them , ironically , was a battalion of the former Rhodesian African Rifles , a 3,000-man brigade commanded by white officers and once the scourge of Zimbabwean guerrilla fighters . By week 's end the national army troops had regained control of Bulawayo . Up to 1,000 dissident ZIPRA troops disappeared into the bush . Many carried their machine guns and grenade launchers with them , auguring more strife . <P> Nkomo rushed to the city to try to cool tempers among his Ndebele tribe . He denied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recent demotion by Mugabe . " I do n't think anybody knows what started it . When somebody shoots off a gun , it becomes infectious , " he said . <P> To avoid or at least contain future clashes , Nkomo proposed relocating army bases far from civilian centers . But no matter how far the units are removed , the dangerous , deeply rooted tribal and political antagonisms will go with them .
