PELLA:OASIS IN THE 20th CENTURY Pella ( pop . 7,800 ) sits islanded in the gently rolling cornfields and pastures of Marion County , in south-central Iowa , some 40 miles southeast of Des Moines . As one approaches it ( as I did ) on the backwater highway from the south , it has the look of any prairie town  --  a cloud of leafy green billowing up across the open farmlands , a sudden thrust of grain elevators , of power-plant chimneys , of a water tower . The familiar continues  --  a Hy-Vee Food Store , an A &; W fast-food drive-in , the Dutch Mill Motel , Don 's Skelly Service , a Budweiser tavern with a window sign : " Mixed Drinks . " There is a right-angle turn . Highway 163 becomes Main Street  --  becomes every other small-town Main Street : a long , long street of small clapboard houses , most of them white , with sidewalks and shade trees and porch swings and a letter carrier trudging along with his bag . But then the scene abruptly changes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ widens , becomes a park-like square : a good four acres of spreading maples and formal plantations of ornamental crabapple trees and flower beds and wagon-spoke walks and slatted green benches and a lily pond with a sculptured fountain . I slowed my car and looked . At one end of the square , lifting up from a spacious stylobate reached by two broad flights of shallow steps , were two great white columns surmounted by an elaboration of bells and rearing heraldic lions and a glittering golden crown . I followed the creep of traffic around the square . The business buildings that faced the square were narrow and brick-built , most of them two floors , with stores on the street and apartments above . Many of them had stair-stepped gable roofs or balustraded roofs or mansard roofs or steeply pitched roofs finished with curved red tiles , and the facades of all but two or three of them were bright with intricate designs  --  painted , sculptured masonry or glazed ceramic tile . I found a parking slot near the soaring columns and got out . The sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stately lilt of Offenbach 's " Barcarolle . " It seemed to come from the top of the columns . I stood and listened and stared . " I know what you mean , " Dennis Friend , the former news editor of the Pella weekly Chronicle , told me later that day . " I know exactly . I was a newcomer here myself  --  from Omaha . I remember the day I arrived to take that job . My wife and I drove around the square . We looked at each other , and drove around again . And Konni shook her head and said , " This is n't Iowa . This is Europe . ' " Pella is not Europe , but it is , in certain conspicuous respects , European . It had its origin in the religious ferment that troubled mid-19th-century Holland , and it still strongly reflects its roots . It was founded by a young dissenting minister of the authoritarian Dutch Reformed Church named Henry Peter Scholte and some 100 like-minded followers in 1847 , and until well within living memory it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about 90 percent ) Dutch . All the leading families of Pella are of Dutch ancestry , and many of them bear the names of the earliest settlers  --  Kuyper , Vande Voort , Vermeer , Gaass , De Vries , Van Gorp , Dingeman , Lautenbach , Leydens , Roorda , Van Zee , Bogaards . The Pella telephone directory lists several Smiths and four Joneses . There are , in contrast , 51 Vermeers ( or VerMeers ) , 49 Van Zees and 45 Van Wyks . The Dutchness of Pella is the natural legacy of its several vigorous founding families . The town itself , however , was ( and to a large extent remains ) the almost single-handed achievement of Henry Peter Scholte . Dominie ( as he seems always to have been called ) Scholte  --  born in Amsterdam in 1805 , a graduate of the University of Leyden and the recipient of a comfortable mercantile fortune  --  created Pella . It was he who chose Iowa as its site and it was Scholte who bought , for cash , the land upon which Pella was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followers . It was he who plotted Pella and ( recalling the ancient Palestinian city of Christian refuge ) gave it its name . It was he who designed the central square as Garden Square and contributed the land for another square of similar size , West Market ( now a park with a picnic shelter ) . It was he who named the streets of Pella . The original east-and-west streets honored the republican ideals of the time ( Liberty , Independence , Union ) and the standard American heroes ( Columbus , Washington , Franklin ) . The principal north-and-south streets were less conventionally named . They designated what he conceived to be the ten stages through which a Christian must pass to redemption : Entrance , Inquiry , Perseverance , Reformation , Gratitude , Experience , Patience , Confidence , Expectation and Accomplishment . ( These names were changed by a self-conscious city council shortly before the First World War to conform to a more American tradition : Reformation Avenue , for example , became Main Street and Gratitude became Broadway . Nevertheless , the old names have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the Pella Country club , where they serve , not inappropriately , as the names of the holes of its nine-hole golf course  --  all of them but Accomplishment . ) It was Scholte who brought a post office to Pella , and he served as its first postmaster . He was a founder and the first editor of the town 's first newspaper , the Gazette . He was , of course , the first pastor of the first church in Pella . It was he whose gift of land ( a city block for a campus , and two farms to provide endowment ) established , in 1853 , the still functioning and flourishing Central College of the Reformed Church in America . And on September 17 , 1847 , less than a month after he and his followers arrived in Pella , Scholte gathered his flock together on the site of the projected Garden Square , where ( as he recalled some years later in his memoirs ) " we made our first declaration to become citizens of the United States , so as to identify ourselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It was a declaration and an identification ( proclaimed in Dutch by a company of men in wooden shoes , red shirts and black velvet jackets ) that would seem to have forecast the future of Pella : a rejection of Holland and ardent retention of everything Dutch . Pella , in the first year or two of its settlement , was a straggle of log shanties and cave-like huts roofed over with prairie-grass sod . Its Yankee Iowan neighbors called it Strawtown . The first permanent dwelling to be built in Pella was built for Scholte and his wife and three children , and it was built for permanency . Today , it occupies much of the block just north of the square . It is a handsome house , a freehand copy of a plantation house that Scholte had seen and admired in Missouri  --  a long , rambling white clapboard affair with galleries and bow windows and fanlights and much jigsaw ornamentation  --  and it is still by far the most imposing place in Pella . Scholte 's house is now the home of his great-granddaughter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is around 60 , a tall , attractive woman of disciplined poise and posture . I had tea with her one afternoon in her sunny Victorian parlor . " Oh , no , " she told me . " I was born in the old Gaass house , but I 've lived here most of my life . And , of course , I 'm the last person who will ever live here . We 've given the house to Pella  --  to the Historical Society . They plan to preserve it as a museum , and in many ways it is a museum . Almost everything you see here goes back to Dominie Scholte 's time . You may have noticed that big iron chest near the window . Dominie Scholte brought his fortune to America in that chest , and it later served as the safe of the old Pella National Bank . The work of renovation has already started here . Martha Lautenbach , of the Society , and a couple of workmen are busy in the east wing right now . And Martha plans to furnish part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The arrangement is that I have this wing for the rest of my life . I could n't ask for anything more . I love this house . It 's such a beautiful house . An architect once told me that it could only have been built by a poet . I 'm not sure I know what he meant , but Dominie Scholte did have taste , and he certainly built his house to last . The foundations are stone and four feet thick . We made some changes in the plumbing a few years ago , and the workmen broke three jackhammers trying to get through to the cellar . And the clapboard siding is walnut  --  solid black walnut . It 's probably worth a fortune just as lumber . But there is sadness here , too . Dominie Scholte 's young wife  --  lovely little Mareah Krantz  --  was never happy here . She was so young  --  only 26 when they left Holland  --  and she had been raised very gently and very elegantly in France . She was never cut out to be a pioneer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but she was wearing a blue silk dress that had been made for her in Paris and a bonnet trimmed with flowers and lace . And she was attended by her personal maid , little Dirkie . There 's a family story about their arrival here . They had all been traveling for days from the Mississippi River port at Keokuk . The wagon train came up from the Skunk River ford and stopped in this empty prairie . Dominie Scholte helped Mareah down from her seat . She looked around . ' But , Dominie , ' she said , ' where is Pella ? ' ' My dear , ' he told her , ' we are in the center of it . ' I 'm sure she tried to make the best of her lot . She had her children and her servants and her square piano and her beautiful Paris clothes and her 23-room house . I 've always admired her reaction when they opened the barrels of lovely old delft ware they had brought from Holland  --  and found almost everything smashed to smithereens . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pave a little garden walk . It 's sunken away and vanished now , but I found a pretty little blue-and-white piece in the lawn one day when I was a young girl . Mareah lived here for 44 years . She died in 1892 , at the age of 72 , and she is buried beside Dominie Scholte in the family plot at Oakwood Cemetery . But her last words were , ' I 'm dying a stranger in a strange land . ' " The immediate past president of the Pella Historical Society is a recently retired teacher of theatre arts and communications at Central College named Maurice Birdsall . Birdsall is a plump little man , and he lives alone with a little Boston bull named Doonie in a cluttered little house ( circa 1853 ) on what was once Reformation Avenue , about four blocks from the square . I called on him one morning . " Well , " he said , settling down in a throne-like chair in front of a smoldering fireplace fire . " I 'll put it this way . I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  I mean , what could be more English than Birdsall ! ? I 'm not even Dutch . But I am a Pellan : I 've lived in Pella for more than 40 years  --  since 1938 ? and I love it . I came here as a teacher , of course . Which was a most fortunate thing . I mean , I could never have made it as a businessman . This is a Dutch town , and in those days , before the Second World War , it was even Dutchier . I knew a couple  --  I wo n't mention their names , except to say they were n't Dutch  --  who came here from somewhere and opened a little business on the square . And the second day they were open a man came in  --  he was Dutch , of course  --  and advised them to sell out before they went broke . It was good advice , and they took it and left . Those were the days when if a Dutch boy or girl had a date with a boy or girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's different now . But there are still a lot of families who would feel real shame at a mixed marriage . Especially to a Catholic . Catholics  --  because of all those years of Spanish domination of Holland  --  are beyond the pale . As for the Dutch churches  --  the Reformed and the Christian Reformed  --  they seem to build a new one every year . I think there must be 16 churches in town now . The congregations are constantly outgrowing the capacity of the buildings . I was raised a Methodist . But I like the Dutch . They 're a very fine people . They have every virtue . Take that saying ' Dutch treat . ' People think that that means the Dutch are stingy . Actually , they are extremely generous . They 're just not showoffs . They frown on check-grabbing . I love Dutch culture  --  Dutch antiques especially . As you can see , I 'm a collector . " Let me tell you about some of my nice things . I wo n't go into the furniture ; it speaks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's not a lady 's compact , although I 'll understand if you think it is . Actually , it 's a Sunday peppermint box . In the old days here , all the way into the 1940s , the Sunday services were very long  --  an hour of prayer and a two-hour sermon . The ladies carried those little boxes of peppermint drops for the children if they began to get restless . I have another little box -- Oh dear . Now , where did I put it ? Well , no matter . It 's a lovely little box the ladies carried for themselves . It held cotton soaked in cologne that they could sniff and revive themselves if they began to feel faint . Of course , the ladies were expected to sit quietly in their pews all through the service . The men had a masculine privilege . They could stand up and stretch . " Birdsall heaved on the arms of his chair and stood up . But it was n't to stretch . He stepped to the fireplace . " My real collection , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for example  --  it 's faced in delft tile . Ah , I see you 're surprised . You did n't know that delft could be brown and white . It can be many colors , although blue and white is , perhaps , the classic combination . Brown and white may have been the original delft . I know it was very popular circa 1660 . They also made a beautiful polychrome . I 'm afraid the best of my collection is on loan to the Historical Society Museum . That 's just east of the square on Franklin Street  --  next door to the Wyatt Earp House . Oh yes  --  we claim Wyatt Earp . He spent his boyhood here . But no matter . I 'll put it this way . Delft is my passion . I wonder if you know that it was n't even called delft until around the 1890s . It began , of course , simply as chinoiserie  --  an imitation of Chinese porcelain . That would have been in the early 17th century . Delft was merely the name of the town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interesting : Delft was originally a brewing center , but something happened and the breweries went broke , and to save themselves the owners turned to making this heavy glazed ware . There were 17 factories there by the end of the 17th century . Then there was a shift in taste , and Meissen ware , or some call it Dresden , came into fashion . The Delft factories were out of business for many years . My delft is all old delft . Modern delft is entirely different . The color is no longer cooked into the clay . Some of it is very pretty . But I prefer my early delft . I wish I could tell you the value of my collection , but I dare not . I would't want to tempt some vandal . Although , of course , there is n't much of that here in Pella . This is n't Des Moines . My only hope is that I can keep my collection intact and leave it to our museum . But you know about pensions in these days of inflation . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not the only Pellan with a passion for delft . Delft of every kind  --  old delft , new delft , even imitation delft  --  is everywhere in Pella , and it appears in every form . Every home has its plates or pots or cups or bowls or trays or vases or pitchers or salt and pepper shakers or flower holders or figurines , or at least a decorative tile or two . The fronts of many of the buildings around the square are decorated with delft-tile panels , and so are many stores and offices and professional waiting rooms , and delft of every quality is sold in a dozen shops and stores . I lodged in Pella at the Dutch Mill Motel on the southern outskirts of town . I was comfortable there in a second-floor room ( whose furnishings included both the usual Gideon Bible and a copy of " Reach Out : An Illustrated Edition of the Living New Testament , paraphrased by Ken Taylor , additional text by Harold Myra " ) with a view across the highway of one of Pella 's many large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not cafe or coffee shop , and I took all my meals in town . I always had breakfast , and usually lunch , at the Central Park Cafe . The Central Park Cafe is agreeably Dutch in appearance ( delft-blue facade , shuttered casement windows , much decorative delft tiling inside and out , and delft-blue booths and chairs ) and also in much of its cuisine ( " Our Speciality , Dutchman 's Delight : Imported Holland Cheese Drizzled Over Hot Pella Bologna " ) , and its staff includes some of the prettiest , smilingest , most scatterbrained waitresses I have ever known : " Oh , gee , I 'm sorry , I In the center of Pella stands the Tulip Tower , its classic lines seeming to proclaim this is no ordinary town . Across the top is emblazoned the motto of Holland 's William of Orange : ' je Maintiendrai " ? " I shall endure .

I often saw him there in the late afternoon ; he was usually there at lunch ; he was always around in the morning . I see him in memory  --  a vaguely troubled-looking man of around 40. thickly sideburned , heavily mustached  --  standing thoughtfully at the kitchen door , pacing the aisles between the booths and the tables , sitting with a group of coffee drinkers at a big , round table in the rear of the room . He sometimes sat down in my booth and sipped a cup of black coffee . One morning he joined me for breakfast . " I do n't know how much you know about Pella . Some towns have their high-class people and their low-class people , and the two do n't ever get together . Pella is different . The well-to-do people here are humble people .

This is a democratic town  --  real Dutch democracy . Take that big table back there  --  those men sitting there drinking coffee . They 're all kinds . They 're businessmen and professional men and farmers and clerks and guys that work with their hands . Everybody here knows everybody else . And nobody tries to grab the check . They toss a coin to see who pays . The Bible says thou shall not gamble . I suppose you could call what they do gambling . But I look at it another way . " He took a sip of his coffee .

" No , I 'm sorry , " Leonard Gosselink told me . Gosselink , another of Pella 's many fourth-generation Pellans , owns and operates Gosselink 's Book Shop , a few doors down from I n't Veld Bologna , on the Main Street side of the square . " We do n't carry secular books anymore . You might try Ken 's Photo and Hobby-craft on Union Street . And , of course , there 's the CarnegieViersen Public Library just across the square . Our book business now is all in the Christian category  --  Christian living , marriage and family , personal testimonials , devotional and inspirational and Bible study . It 's the same with records . We specialize in Christian contemporary music  --  what they call Christian rock and roll . ' Let 's Just Praise the Lord , ' by Bill and Gloria Gaither , is very big . And so is B.J. Thomas 's ' Happy Man . ' Oh , you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . " I dined my first night in Pella ( on the recommendation of Dennis Friend of the Chronicle ) at a restaurant called the Strawtown Inn , and I ate there every night thereafter . Its name recalls the sod-roofed shanties of pioneer Pella , but the name is only a name . Strawtown is a thoroughly urban restaurant , and a good one . It is situated on the western edge of town , three or four blocks from the square , and is housed in a tall , narrow , red brick building ( circa 1855 ) built in the attractively functional mid-19th-century row-house style  --  an English basement , two full upper floors , and a dormer-windowed attic . The attic at Strawtown is the bar . The two floors below , reached by a Ladder-steep stairway , constitute the restaurant proper , and the basement is a tavern ( stone walls , exposed beams ) called De Kelder ( or cellar ) , which offers a chophouse menu of steak , ribs and fried chicken , with a salad bar . Drinks are available , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) wine or beer . As everywhere else in Pella , Coors and Budweiser are as popular as Heineken . The Strawtown is a formal restaurant ( 14-foot ceilings , white tablecloths and napkins , candlelight , fresh flowers , reservations required ) , and its three rooms together seat only a little more than a hundred persons . I had my first dinner at Strawtown at a front window table on the second floor in a delft-blue-and-white room , and I ordered from a delft-blue-and-white menu of heavy glazed stock . The listings were all in Dutch , but with English translations . There were 15 entrees , among them gevulde karbonade ( stuffed pork chop ) , ossenhaas ( Cornish hen stuffed with mushrooms ) , Hollandse rollade ( Dutch spiced beef ) and Hollandse gebakken kip ( Dutch baked chicken with paprika ) . I had the chicken . My meal began with an appetizer of tiny meatballs in a spicy Indonesian sauce . Then came a cream-of-cauliflower soup . Then the chicken , served with a dressing of rice cooked with mushrooms and onions . With the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Burgundy . There was a choice of apple bread or hard rolls . Then a salad of Bibb lettuce and tomatoes , with an oil-and-vinegar dressing . My dessert was Hollandse kus : vanilla ice cream with Dutch Advokaat liqueur . The coffee brought me back to earth . It was the standard watery cafe coffee of motel America . " Well , the proper name  --  the Dutch name  --  is Tulpen Toren , " Lloyd Vander Streek , the president of the Pella Park Commission , told me . We were standing at the foot of the double-columned monument that dominates the south end of the square . The carillon cleared its lofty throat . The melting opening chords of Schumann 's " Traumerei " chimed gently down around us . Vander Streek raised his voice . " But everybody just calls it the Tulip Tower . It was designed by an architect named John Lautenbach . He did the original design in 1940 , and this is a reconstruction built in 1968 . It was a gift to Pella from Mr. and Mrs. Peter H. Kuyper , Stu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was born and raised here , but he moved out East and made quite a reputation in New York . He came back here in the early ' 50s and built himself a Continued on page 98 Pella continued from page 79 home out in the country . He died a few years ago . I suppose the Tulip Tower does look a little strange to a newcomer . There 's an inscription on the garden wall  --  well , I copied it down one day , and I brought it along to show you . Here 's what it says : ' Erected to the Glory of God and Country with Prayers for the Ultimate Victory Over Malice , Scorn , Hatred , Envy , Criticism , Judgment , Bigotry , Prejudice , Intolerance and Apartheid the Anti-Christ Found Lurking in the Church . ' I 'm not sure I really understand it . Lautenbach used to say he got the inspiration for the tower from the Bible  --  he likened the columns to the columns in the Temple of Solomon . What the tower is , of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's held the second weekend in May  --  Thursday , Friday and Saturday up to midnight . As you may know , we observe the Sabbath here . So the festival closes at midnight sharp . We do n't even clean up until Monday morning . The festival includes parades , dancing in the streets , costume entertainments and the crowning of a Tulip Queen . We can usually count on an attendance of around 100,000 . I own the Pella Bootery across the street , you know , and I stock wooden shoes for the festival . You would n't believe how many pairs I sell . But the focus of the Tulip Festival is tulips . That 's a large part of my job on the Park Commission . All the flower beds you see in all our parks are tulip beds . And our main streets are bordered with tulip beds . We estimate that we have in excess of 100,000 tulips in bloom at festival time . Oh , it 's a wonderful , beautiful sight . Our bulbs are all imported from Holland .

We avoid dark colors in the parks : the blacks , like Queen of the Night , and the purples  --  all those new inventions . But these and all other kinds are grown for private displays . Our tulips bloom for about a month . But , as I say , we Dutch are thrifty . Our flower beds do n't sit empty . When the tulips are over , petunias go in . I think they 're very beautiful , too .

I arrived in Pella on a Tuesday , and just about everyone I talked with through the rest of the week told me  --  warned me  --  of its Sabbatarianism , but , even so , the reality took me by surprise . With certain humanitarian exceptions , no places of business  --  not even chain stores  --  are open on Sunday . It is generally considered reprehensible to wash one 's car or mow one 's lawn on Sunday . Pella has ( by my count ten service stations , but only one or two ( " They 're owned by out-of-towners , " an attendant at Braafhart 's Standard Service told me ) are open on Sunday , largely to serve the traveler . The only eating place I found open for breakfast on Sunday was the Burger Barn . The Strawtown restaurant  --  but not De Kelder  --  opens for a couple of hours on Sunday for lunch ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or three days in advance . The bar , however , is closed . The only place I could find to eat on Sunday night was George 's Pizza , just off the square , on East Franklin Street . Most  --  perhaps almost all  --  Pellans observe the Sabbath in church , and many of these churchgoers attend both morning and evening services . The only Sunday morning sound in Pella is the sound of church bells , and the only stir in life is the bumper-to-bumper crawl of church-bound traffic . I spent the morning walking in the park across the way from the Dutch Mill Motel , and I had its eight or ten acres entirely to myself . In the afternoon , I drove down to the square . I strolled and sat on a bench and read the Des Moines Sunday Register for an hour or two . I found my way to George 's Pizza around 7:30 that evening , and I dined ( soup , pizza , the usual transparent coffee ) as leisurely as I could , along with a scattering of other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I gave up dawdling and finished , and as I stood at the cashier 's counter paying my bill I saw a gathering surge of cars moving around the square .

There were sedans and pickup trucks and decorated vans and four-wheel-drive Scouts and Broncos , and the occupants were all young  --  a teenage boy and his girl . I marked a red Dodge pickup and watched it turn right off Main Street , move past the Solomonic Tulpen Toren , turn right again onto Broadway . A couple of minutes later , I saw it coming south on Main Street . I watched it turn and move past the tower again . I stood there alone on the corner and watched the endless circling and recircling for 15 or 20 minutes . I guessed there were at least a hundred cars involved in that obsessional parade .

And Dutch pride keeps this town as clean as any in the nation . But there 's more to be said for Pella than just being Dutch  --  a whole lot more . I 'm happy to be here to say it . Pella is a prosperous town . Our unemployment is practically nil . We have eight manufacturing plants here , and they employ almost half of our population-3,300 men and women .

I get 11 holidays a year with pay  --  all the regular ones plus Good Friday and my birthday . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us life insurance , dental insurance , Blue Cross and Blue Shield and a Christmas bonus . They also have a profit-sharing program . Everybody gets about 15 percent of his gross earnings every year . The average share is around $2,000 per person . But there 's more to it than that . Rolscreen is a nonunion shop . Three times in the last 15 years , the union has tried to organize the plant . The first election went , lopsided against it . The second was a little closer . The third was more against the union than the second . Why did we Continued on following page turn the union down ? Well , we listened to the organizers , and we thought a little bit , and we did a little figuring , and it turned out that if we got the union pay rate we 'd all take a big cut in pay . " I talked with Dr. Kenneth Weller , the president of Central College , in his bright , book-filled office on the second floor of Central Hall , the administration building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a humpbacked Japanese bridge . In the distance , I could see an avenue of flags stretching in the breeze  --  the flags of Britain , France , Austria , Spain , Mexico and the United States . Students were standing in groups or moving along the walks . Downstairs in the lobby I had seen a wall plaque with a Zen-like truism : " Anyone can count the number of seeds which come from an apple , but only God knows the number of apples which can come from a seed . " Dr. Weller gave me a look of gleaming satisfaction . " No , " he said . " No , indeed . We are not a Bible college . Were much too old and established for that . Were not even exactly a provincial college . Half our students spend part of their academic life studying abroad , in one of the several countries where we have an arrangement . Those flags represent our foreign connections . The fact is , we require only one course in religion . No , what we are is a Christian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not interested in doctrine . Our basic tone is a concern for values . We 're weak on piety and strong on life in its wholeness . We 're concerned with how things work , but also with what ought to be . We remember here that Watergate was not the work of uneducated people . It was the work of highly educated people deficient in morality and ethical sense . We attempt to teach that ethical sense ? to reestablish it , I should say . To that extent , we 're concerned with the total lives of our students . Pella has always been an appropriate setting for our work . " A bell rang . A couple ran hand in hand across the bridge . Dr. Weller had his back to the window . He straightened a file of papers on his desk . " Last Monday , " he said , " we had a young male student killed in an auto accident . His friends organized a memorial service . It was spontaneous . There were Scripture readings and readings of secular poetry . Four hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense of community here , and I think that that turnout is a good demonstration of it . We think of it as a Christian sense of community . And it is n't just here at Central College . It embraces the whole of Pella  --  the college , the churches , the business community , everybody . It is the whole of Pella . Even newcomers here seem to feel it . I know I did . I 'm Dutch myself , but I 'm from Michigan , and I 've been here only since 1969 . There is a pervading community sense of heritage ? an almost mystic feeling of roots . And roots are a source of community . Responsibility equates with community . You see this responsibility , this morality , this ethic in the personal frugality here and the public generosity . I 'm sure you 've heard about the generosity of our industries . But they are n't the only givers . Everyone gives to his capacity . It 's something that goes much deeper than the more conspicuous pieties  --  deeper than the Sabbath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He touched the file of papers again . " Now , do n't misunderstand me . I 'm not saying that we 're unique  --  that we 're an oasis here in the middle of the 20th century . " He stopped . He sat smiling at me across his desk . His smile faded . " No , " he said . " I 'll amend that . We are a little oasis here . I 'm afraid that 's exactly what we are . " X
