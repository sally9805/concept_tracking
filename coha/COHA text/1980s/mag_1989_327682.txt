When Patrick Purdy sprayed 100 or so bullets from a rapid-fire assault rifle into a crowd of children outside a Stockton , Calif. , elementary school , killing five students and wounding 29 others and one teacher before dispatching himself with a pistol , he set off a national wave of horror . If tots playing innocently in a schoolyard at recess are no longer safe from heavily armed criminals and lunatics , who is ? Many citizens concluded that no one is , and some on the West Coast resolved to take action . Their solution : to arm themselves for survival in a world seemingly gone mad . <P> And so the Stockton massacre started a new spiral in America 's domestic arms race . All last week California gun shops were jammed with customers , sometimes standing three or four deep at counters , clamoring to buy an imitation AK-47 like the one Purdy used or , failing that , some other semiautomatic paramilitary weapon . ( His gun was actually an AKS , a Chinese-made semiautomatic version of the fully automatic Soviet AK-47 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) At B &; B Sales in North Hollywood , owner Bob Kahn spent much of Thursday frantically phoning suppliers to replenish his sold-out stocks . " We 're in a frenzy , " he said . Kahn assured customers that 50 AK-47 look-alikes would arrive on Friday , but some buyers were in no mood to wait . Jay Montoya , a Los Angeles salesman who had already visited three other stores in a futile attempt to buy the Chinese-made weapon , finally plunked down $341 and walked out with a Ruger Mini-14 , an American semiautomatic rifle with a smaller caliber . Said he : " In case there 's an earthquake , I 'm going to protect my house ( ( from looters , presumably ) ) . I know how to use this gun , and I would . " <P> In Castro Valley , Calif. , Dick Bash , owner of a store named Combat Arms , reports that he is overwhelmed by demand , largely from gun fanciers who fear that the Purdy massacre might at last prod legislators into taking some serious steps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " There is an arms race on , all right . People are rushing to buy guns before the government takes them away . " <P> In all probability , however , Combat Arms customers need not worry . The Stockton slaughter has indeed prompted talk in state legislatures and the halls of Congress about cracking down on gun sales , and a few actual proposals . Some would ban the high-powered paramilitary weapons that , foes say , have only one use : to kill human beings . Others would institute a federally mandated waiting period , generally 15 days , before a qualified buyer could pick up his gun . ( Under the bewildering mosaic of state laws now in effect , waiting periods range from 30 days in New York to zero in Virginia and Oregon , where Purdy bought his rifle . ) Such a cooling-off period is thought necessary to allow time for a thorough background check that would disclose whether the would-be buyer is a felon or mentally ill . Such proposals have picked up powerful new allies : police chiefs who once opposed gun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crack-dealing gangs and other criminals .
