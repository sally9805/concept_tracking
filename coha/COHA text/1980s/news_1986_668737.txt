Mayor Harold Washington used his new tie-breaking vote Wednesday as the Chicago City Council approved the largest single increase in property tax collections in the city ' s history . In more than five hours of debate in the occasionally rancorous session  --  the second in which Washington has exercised control in the newly realigned council  --  aldermen also voted to approve several appointments that had languished under the former majority bloc control , including one made more than 2 1/2 years ago . But the major work of the session involved passage of new tax collections totaling nearly $87 million , with more levies predicted . In a 25-25 tie broken by Washington ' s vote , the administration won approval of a $79. 9 million increase in property tax revenues , a liquor tax to generate $3. 4 million and a reimposed $5 employers ' head tax to add $3. 7 million to city coffers for the remainder of this year . The employers ' head tax had been $4 per worker . The move to tax alcohol would levy 50 cents a gallon on wholesale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cents on a gallon of beer , all to begin on July 15 . Ald. Edward Vrdolyak ( 10th ) , a leader of the council opposition , warned that the wholesale tax is likely to be passed on to consumers at their neighborhood taverns . The council also repealed a controversial commercial lease tax , which the council passed last year but which a Cook County Circuit Court judge had ruled unconstitutional . An appeal of the ruling is pending . During the lengthy debate , aldermen alternated their posture from friendly to menacing , while Washington appeared amused by his frustrated opponents . Ald. Edward Burke ( 14th ) , the Finance Committee chairman and a leader of anti-administration forces , declared the tax measures " the biggest fraud perpetuated on the taxpayers of Chicago " and warned that the council action violated " truth in taxation " statutes and would face a serious legal challenge from taxpayers . Noting the recent approval of $45 million in property taxes to pay for Chicago firefighter pay raises , Burke warned , " If you vote another $80 million it will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Chicago . " Under the new revenue package , property tax collections will increase from Washington ' s levy passed last December from $368 , 586 , 837 to $493 , 925 , 887 . Washington administration aides said property tax rates will be frozen at the 1984 level of 2. 768 per $100 equalized assessed valuation , a complex formula used by the county clerk to tax property . The new tax revenue will come from reassessments and new property development , the aides said . Hardest hit will be homeowners in the northwest quadrant of the city , which was reassessed last year , and those in the southwest quadrant , which is being reassessed this year . According to administration estimates , owners of a home assessed at $60 , 000 will pay $432. 79 in city taxes this year , an increase of $109. 58 over the amount that would have been paid under the original 1986 budget passed by the council last December . Washington still must find $26. 3 million in new taxes or other revenues to pay for wage increases and benefits granted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose contracts still are in negotiation . Burke said approval of the nearly $125 million in new tax revenues violates state statutes , because no public hearings were held on the latest round of levies . Washington scoffed at Burke ' s warnings and later said the city has 15 days to hold hearings to comply with state laws . The revenue proposal was designed to fill a $78 million gap in the city ' s budget created when a circuit court judge declared unconstitutional the planned tax on commercial leases . In its revenue proposal , the administration said 300 more jobs will be cut from the city ' s payroll as part of about $3. 7 million in cutbacks passed Wednesday . The 300-job estimate is a revision of Washington ' s earlier warning that an estimated 1 , 000 jobs would be cut because of the budget shortfall . " Everybody in this city understands we ' re in this bind because of federal cutbacks , " Washington said . " All these things cost money and they must find the dollars some way . " The property @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who argued that the revenue boosts would not be well-received by their constituents , most of whom are homeowners . But as the council approved various taxes and revenue hikes , an audience crowded with Washington supporters cheered and applauded . In a surprise move , the administration scrapped any effort to impose a 2- cent-a-gallon gasoline tax on motorists and fought attempts by Vrdolyak and Ald. Roman Pucinski ( 41st ) to impose a tax on jet fuel sold in Chicago . The aviation fuel tax would have replaced the proposed liquor tax and eased the need for property tax revenue increases . Ald. Joseph Kotlarz ( 35th ) , an opposition alderman , suggested that the new property revenues would become a political issue for Washington in the February mayoral primary , a sentiment echoed by Washington ' s announced challenger , former Mayor Jane Byrne . " Higher taxes are what happens when everything stops in a city , " Byrne said . " Development of Navy Pier alone would have provided $17 million to the tax base . . . . Voters will have the final comment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " This tax increase is your indictment and you ' ll be sentenced in February , " Kotlarz said . Lakefront aldermen , including Aldermen Martin Oberman ( 43d ) , Burton Natarus ( 42d ) , Marion Volini ( 48th ) and David Orr ( 49th ) , remained aligned with the Washington administration in voting for the property tax revenue increases and for the liquor and head tax provisions . Because of the higher value of buildings and condominiums in North Side and Near North wards , those aldermen are expected to face sustained criticism for their votes well into next year ' s aldermanic elections . Trying to ease some of the anticipated criticism , the mayor praised them for looking at " the whole picture " of trying to balance a $2. 1 billion city budget . " They faced up to their responsibility , " Washington said . " What happened today is necessary . " Michael Thom , senior research associate with the Civic Federation , said , " It ' s a deplorable situation that the City of Chicago has to resort to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ budget . The property tax is the tax of last resort. . . . ( but ) it obviously is the only tax the council can agree on . " But Franklin Cole , vice president and director of the Central Area Committee , a group representing business interests , said , " We ' re very pleased that it was resolved in a manner that did not involve a commercial lease tax or any means that would burden the ability of business to create jobs and improve the economic climate in this city . " Although opposition aldermen had just lost several parliamentary moves , with Washington casting his tie-breaking vote , they launched into debate over taxes and who would receive the heaviest portion of those levies . " If you want to vote for this , don ' t come to me and cry about the poor people in the neighborhoods , " shouted Ald. Bernard Stone ( 50th ) , referring to the liquor tax as he pointed to aldermen aligned with the mayor . " You stuck it to them , " he said . Ald. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' s a very good ordinance if you want to raise moral standards . If you want to sin , you ' ve got to pay for it in the 26th Ward . " Wednesday ' s session enabled Washington to act on many lingering appointments , including what Ald. Lawrence Bloom ( 5th ) called " the senior hostage appointment , " that of the mayor himself to the Public Building Commission . That appointment , made Sept. 28 , 1983 , was referred to the council for a vote two years ago , but it was tabled by opposition-bloc aldermen . Burke tried to block the vote , contending that parliamentary procedures were not met . But the mayor , casting the tie-breaking vote , defeated Burke ' s measure . Washington ' s appointment then was approved 39-8 . Other Washington appointments that were approved : Rev. Monserrate Romero and Reginald Adams to the Board of Municipal Investigations ; Dempsey Travis to the Cultural Affairs Advisory Board ; John Agrela , Ernest Bush Jr. and Joseph Banks to the Building Board of Appeals ; and Raymond Tasch to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Aldermen Edward M.
