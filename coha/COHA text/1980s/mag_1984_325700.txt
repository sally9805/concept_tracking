Mad , mad Leroy Barnes <P> Even the judge was shocked . After listening to hours of testimony about a multimillion-dollar drug-distribution network involving hired killers with a penchant for chain saws , U.S. District Judge Milton Pollack marveled that such iniquities " could be so coldbloodedly related . " Yet the tales so coolly told in court helped indict 44 major traffickers and convict 16 . The man doing the talking was Leroy ( " Nicky " ) Barnes , a.k.a . " Mr. Untouchable . " Barnes fingered Frank James , his ex-partner in drug dealing , for ordering his brother-in-law ice-picked to death . James , said Barnes , employed a four-man hit team ; one aspiring killer slew a random passer-by as an audition for the job . <P> Barnes , 51 , won his notoriety when , as the most flamboyant member of a Mafia-style council of seven " blood brothers , " he earned millions distributing heroin throughout Harlem . In 1977 he was finally nailed , and the sentence was stiff : life imprisonment without possibility of parole . Six years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Even though Barnes claimed last year that he would seek Executive clemency and adopted a repentant tone ( " My whole life was shallow " ) , such meekness will probably go for naught . Barnes volunteered to talk for no more than the assurance that his cooperation would be brought to the attention of the Government . U.S. prosecutors , who last week produced a 19-page memo detailing Barnes ' cooperation , insist that the one man who has the power to grant clemency , the President , is hardly likely to give even as much as a chance for parole . Asks Assistant U.S. Attor-Tney Philip Douglas : " What President wants to go on record as 1 having reduced the sentence of Nicky Barnes ? " <P> Barnes ' lust for vengeance is a more credible explanation , especially since he had to implicate himself in eight murders in order to explain what his former friends did . Prosecutors believe that after switching prisons in 1981 , Barnes began getting more news from the outside world , and he did not like what he heard . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his former blood brothers had cut into his turf , and one had started an affair with Barnes ' favorite mistress . <P> Testified Barnes : " I have no way to reach to get to ' em , and I want to get back at ' em . That 's my primary reason . " If revenge is indeed his reward , then his long life behind bars may be a bit sweeter : he has made it certain that his blood brothers will share his prison life .
