" Last year , I won New York by mistake , probably , " he said . " This year was more exciting . I was not in confusion the last 385 yards . I saw all the people and they all seemed to know my name and my number . It was like everyone was a friend of mine . It was a great source of power. " // Pizzolato played the tortoise yesterday , running well back in the pack while Geoff Smith of Britain and Ahmed Saleh of Djibouti set out on a world-best pace . It was a much less humid but very warm day for a long distance race , a day that felt more like early summer than autumn in New York . And when Smith burned out at 13 miles like the first stage of a rocket , and Saleh faltered just 2 miles from the end , Pizzolato emerged as the winner for the second time , finishing the 16th New York City Marathon in 2 hours 11 minutes 34 seconds. // Grete Waitz of Norway was the women ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last four years , finishing in 2 : 28 : 34 . Mrs. Waitz defeated Lisa Martin of Australia and survived another case of stomach cramps and diarrhea. // " But my stomach , " she said , " felt much better than last year . " Mrs. Waitz and Pizzolato each received $25 , 000 and a new car . Saleh held on for second place behind Pizzolato , finishing in 2 : 12 : 29 . Pat Petersen of Brooklyn was third in 2 : 12 : 59 , representing the best finish by a local runner in the 10 years the marathon has been run in the five boroughs . Petersen was a surprising fourth last year. // Dan Norman , who is from Pennsyl-vania , was fourth in 2 : 14 : 08 , and Gerard Nijboer of the Netherlands was fifth in 2 : 14 : 27 . Of the ancient marathoners making a return appearance in New York , Bill Rodgers was a respectable seventh , in 2 : 15 : 33 . Frank Shorter was 56th , finishing in 2 : 25 : 28 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 15 , 755 runners finished. // It was not considered a strong field , but the race was expected to be competitive . Saleh , who won the World Cup Marathon in Hiroshima earlier this year in 2 : 08 : 09 , was predicting a world best . Thus , Pizzolato believed his victory yesterday would establish him as one of the top runners in the world , even though his time was more than 4 minutes slower than the world best held by Carlos Lopes of Portugal , who ran 2 : 07 : 11 last April in Rotterdam. // " It was warm and windy , " Pizzolato said . " The time was not fast , but the conditions were not good . And Saleh was in good condition . " <> <> Weather Is Capricious // The unpredictable October weather has become the unknown quantity in the marathon . The temperature was 64 degrees and the humidity 55 percent when the cannon sounded at 10 : 45 A.M. , starting 16 , 705 on their way across the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge. // It would be difficult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be perilous to a marathoner - especially Smith , who was traveling through Brooklyn at a pace that would have broken the world best by 2 minutes had he been able to sustain it . Saleh was 20 yards behind , running with Bill Reifsnyder of State College , Pa. , who specializes in half marathons . Saleh was keeping a respectful eye on Smith , who finished second in New York in 1983 - beaten in the final strides by Rod Dixon . <> <> Keeping Own Pace // At this point , Pizzolato was taking in the scenery about 20 runners behind , more than a minute off the leader ' s pace . Smith ' s strategy appeared foolish , even though he later said he was doing what he does best - run in the lead. // " Last year I was in front and nervous , " Pizzolato said . " I knew they were running very fast in front but I wasn ' t sure they could finish . I ran my race , not their race. " // At the 13-mile mark - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bridge into Queens , Smith fell back and Saleh was in the lead , turning and tapping Reifsnyder on the shoulder as if to say goodbye . He was running easily with no evidence of discomfort . He bounded gracefully through Long Island City and crossed the Queensboro Bridge , turning on First Avenue for his first trip on Manhattan ' s fashionable East Side . The brunch crowd lining the avenue toasted his arrival . He was more animated than the typical stoic runner , smiling and pointing to the crowd . The competition was almost half a mile behind . <> <> Saleh Slows Down // It appeared to be just a matter of whether Saleh could set a world best or break Alberto Salazar ' s course record . Saleh is 29 years old and has been running competitively for only four years . At the World Cup he showed a strong finishing kick and yesterday ' s heat figured to bother him less than most . Saleh often trained in 90-degree temperature on the desert in Djibouti. // But between the 15th and 16th miles on First @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When he reached the Bronx , he began to suffer from cramps in his right calf . Smith was fading fast , however , and it was questionable whether Pizzolato and Petersen could catch Saleh before the finish . " I was not worried , " Saleh said. // His face told another story . His expression appeared pained and he occasionally glanced at his feet . If he had looked behind him , he might have seen Pizzolato moving up quickly into fourth , third , then second place , running his evenly paced race . When the runners re-entered Manhattan on the final leg , Pizzolato felt invigorated. // " Step by step , I was catching him , " he said . " The crowd was saying , ' He looks bad , he ' s not in good condition . ' I thought he was in trouble . " <> <> Hill Was ' Last Chance ' // He caught Saleh in Central Park just short of the 24-mile mark , but Saleh repelled that first challenge and moved several strides in front again . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a moment of doubt . Then , approaching 25 miles and a slight rise in the terrain , Pizzolato surged again and passed Saleh. // " I had tried to break away , but he followed me , " Pizzolato said . " The hill was my last chance . He doesn ' t like hills and there are many in Central Park. " // Saleh fell behind quickly , unable to respond , he said , as Pizzolato encouraged him to keep trying . " When he caught me , " Saleh said , " I knew I would be losing the race. " //
