Shau-kong Jaw typifies this new generation . He was born of mainlander parents and belongs to the ruling Kuomintang - the Chinese Nationalist Party. // But he proclaims , ' ' I am Taiwanese , ' ' and wants to turn the 2-million-member party into an organ of mass participatory democracy. // // Opposition politics have been lively on Taiwan , and the international news media have focused , especially since the lifting of martial law July 15 , on the main opposition party , the Democratic Progressive Party ( DPP ) . // But Western observers here say the Kuomintang is likely to remain the ruling party at least through the remaining years of this century - on condition , however , that it turns itself from a party centered on the government bureaucracy to one that can respond to the demands and needs of an increasingly pluralistic society. // ' ' The power of the party should come from the bottom up , not from the top down , ' ' Mr. Jaw said in a recent interview . ' ' Most of our members are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them participate. ' ' // Jaw joined the Kuomintang when he was a freshman at National Taiwan University , the Harvard of Taiwan . He later got an engineering degree from Clemson University in South Carolina , and served for six years as Asian manager for Imperial Oil , a subsidiary of Beatrice Foods . He traveled constantly in East and Southeast Asia. // But then , in his early 30s , he tired of living out of suitcases , ' ' and also I wanted to do something for my country. ' ' // So , in 1981 , he ran for the Taipei City Council . His was far from being the usual political pattern on the island . Instead of spending two or three years building up contacts and forming an organization , he declared his candidacy only a month before elections , managing to persuade the Kuomintang to run him as an experiment . He racked up the highest total of any of the KMT ' s candidates. // Reelected in 1985 , he decided to run for the Legislative Yuan , the national legislature , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ candidates to get the highest tally in his party. // Jaw says the DPP , which has been getting 25 percent of the popular vote , could increase its share to 30 or 35 percent , if it stays united . He adds that it will be difficult for the DPP to replace the KMT and become the ruling party. // To many DPP adherents , the KMT still represents the mainlanders who came over in 1949 , but Jaw and others point out that the majority of KMT members now are Taiwanese . As second- and third-generation mainlanders grow up on the island , Jaw says , the distinction between Taiwanese and mainlanders grows less important. // Jaw upholds the government ' s three ' ' no ' s ' ' regarding the mainland - no negotiations , no contacts , and no compromise . But he says the ban should be enforced flexibly , and he notes that with the recent lifting of the interdiction on direct travel to Hong Kong , inhabitants of Taiwan are free to go on to the mainland. // As Taiwan becomes a prosperous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become more attractive to the mainland Chinese - to such an extent , he says , that eventually Peking , which advocates travel and trade , may be forced to close its door. // Turning to domestic affairs , Jaw recalls that most members of the Legislative Yuan were elected when the KMT controlled the mainland . They fled to Taiwan in 1949 , and since no new elections could be held on the mainland , they have grown progressively older , until today the majority of the 311 members are in their 80s. // Taiwan , as a province of China , had members in the Legislative Yuan at least since the elections of 1947 . Taiwan ' s representation since has been increased to 73 . In addition , there are 27 members elected by overseas Chinese and other categories of voters , such as aborigines. // One of the key democratic reforms being debated is how to turn the Yuan into a truly representative legislature . The DPP wants to do away with mainland members altogether , but that would infringe a shibboleth important to both the government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that China is one. // The communists tolerate the KMT government because they regard it as a remnant of the regime that fled the mainland in 1949 , not as some new , independent entity . And from Taipei ' s viewpoint , the government on the island still is the Republic of China , which will someday be reunified with the mainland. // The compromise solution for democratizing the legislature Jaw espouses is to accord retirement benefits generous enough to persuade perhaps half of the 200 or so mainland-elected members to give up their seats , and let natural attrition take care of the rest. // Another urgent need , says Jaw , is to increase the weight of the legislative arm within the KMT itself . Under a separation of powers similar to that in the United States , a legislator can not take up a ministerial of any other post in the executive branch without giving up his seat . Hitherto the legislature has been so unimportant that , among the 31 standing committee members of the party , only one is a member of the Legislative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be from the legislature , ' ' says Jaw . That , in his opinion , would make the leadership more responsive to the voice of the people. // Finally , on the question of independence , or self-determination , Jaw says a recent poll in Taipei showed 57 percent against independence , and only eight percent for . Along with many other observers , both Taiwanese and mainlanders , he says the majority of Taiwanese recognize independence is a non-issue. // ' ' Our most important priority is survival , ' ' he said . ' ' How would 19 million of us survive and be democratic , prosperous , strong ? Independence is academic theory . It is not a politically practical possibility. ' ' // //
