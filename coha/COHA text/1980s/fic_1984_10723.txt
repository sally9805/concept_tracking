A R I O P U Z Otown seemed full of ghosts . They came on the soft , summer night air laden with the smell of lemon trees , the small whirring of countless insects , the sudden shout of a roving police patrol . " I 'll wait as long as I can , " Michael said gently . " But my father needs me at home . You must make your son come to me . " She nodded and then led him back to the others . Pisciotta was pacing up and down the room . He seemed nervous . " We have decided that we must all wait here until daybreak and curfew is over , " he said . " There are too many trigger-happy soldiers out there in the dark and there could be an accident . Do you object ? " he asked Michael . " No , " Michael said . " As long as it 's not too much of an imposition on our hosts . " They dismissed this as irrelevant . They had stayed up through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town to visit his parents . And besides they had many things to talk about , many details to settle . They got comfortable for the long night ahead . Hector Adonis shed his jacket and tie but still looked elegant . The mother brewed fresh coffee . Michael asked them to tell him everything they could about Turi Guiliano . He felt he had to understand . His parents again told him what a wonderful son Turi had been always . Stefan Andolini told about the day Turi Guiliano had spared his life . Pisciotta told funny stories about Turi 's daring and sense of fun and lack of cruelty . Though he could be merciless with traitors and enemies , he never offered an insult to their manhood with torture and humiliation . And then he told the story of the tragedyat the Portella della Ginestra . " He wept that day , " Pisciotta said . " In front of all the members of his band . " Maria Lombardo said , " He could not have killed those people at Ginestra . " Hector Adonis soothed her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gentle . " He turned to Michael and said , " He loved hooks , I thought he would become a poet or a scholar . He had a temper , 40but he was never cruel . Because his was an innocent rage . He hated injustice . He hated the brutality of the carabinieri toward the poor and their obsequiousness toward the rich . Even as a boy he was outraged when he heard of a farmer who could not keep the corn he grew , drink the wine he pressed , eat the pigs he slaughtered . And yet he was a gentle boy . " Pisciotta laughed . " He is not so gentle now . And you , Hector , do n't play the little schoolteacher now . On horseback you were as big a man as any of us . " Hector Adonis looked at him sternly . " Aspanu , " he said , " this is not the time for your wit . " Pisciotta said to him excitedly , " Little man , do you think I can ever be afraid of you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that there was ingrained dislike between the two men . Pisciotta 's constant reference to the other man 's size , the stern tone in which Adonis always spoke to Pisciotta . There was , in fact , a distrust in the air amongst all of them ; the others seemed to hold Stefan Andolini at arm 's length , Guiliano 's mother seemed to trust no one completely . And yet as the night wore on it was clear that they all loved Turi . Michael said cautiously , " There is a Testament written by Turi Guiliano . Where is it now ? " There was a long silence , all of them watching him intently . And suddenly their distrust included him . Finally Hector Adonis spoke . " He started writing it on my advice and I helped him with it . Every page is signed by Turi . All the secret alliances with Don Croce , with the government in Rome and the final truth about the Portella della Ginestra . If it were made public the government must surely fall . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " I hope then you have it in a safe place , " Michael said . Pisciotta said , " Yes , Don Croce would like to get his hands on the Testament . " Guiliano 's mother said , " At the proper time we will arrange4 ' M A R I O P U Z Oto have the Testament delivered to you . Perhaps you can send it to America with the girl . " Michael looked at them all with surprise . " What girl ? " They all looked away , as if with embarrassment or apprehension . They knew this was an unpleasant surprise and were afraid of his reaction . Guiliano 's mother said , " My son 's fiancee . She is pregnant . " She turned to the others . " She wo n't vanish into thin air . Will he take her or not ? Let him say so now . " Though she tried to maintain her composure it was obvious she was worried about Michael 's reaction . " She will come to you in Trapani . Turi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When she sends word back that she is safe , then Turi will come to you . " Michael said cautiously , " I have no instructions . I would have to consult my people in Trapani about the time element . I know that you and your husband are to follow once your son gets to America . Ca n't the girl wait and go with you ? " Pisciotta said harshly , " The girl is your test . She will send back a code word and then Guiliano will know he is dealing not only with an honest man but an intelligent one . Only then can he believe you can get him safely out of Sicily . " Guiliano 's father said angrily , " Aspanu , I have already told you and my son . Don Corleone has given his word to help us . " Pisciotta said smoothly , " Those are Turi 's orders . " Michael thought quickly . Finally he said , " I think it 's very clever . We can test the escape route and see if it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same escape route for Guiliano . He said to Guiliano 's mother , " I can send you and your husband with the girl . " He looked at them questioningly , but both the parents shook their heads . Hector Adonis said to them gently , " It 's not a bad idea . " Guiliano 's mother said , " We will not leave Sicily while our son is still here . " Guiliano 's father folded his arms and nodded in agreement . And Michael understood what they were thinking . If Turi Guiliano died in Sicily , they had no wish to be in AmerTHES I C I L I A Nica . They must stay to mourn him , to bury him , bring flowers to his grave . The final tragedy belonged to them . The girl could go , she was bound only by love , not by blood . Sometime during the night Maria Lombardo Guiliano showed Michael a scrapbook filled with newspaper stories , posters showing the different prices placed on Guiliano 's head by the government in Rome . She showed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1948 . The story stated that Guilianowas the greatest bandit of modern times , an Italian Robin Hood who robbed the rich to help the poor . It also printed one of the famous letters that Guiliano had sent to the newspapers . It read : " For five years I have fought to make Sicily free . I have given to the poor what I have taken from the rich . Let the people of Sicily speak out whether I am an outlaw or a fighter for freedom . If they speak against me , I will deliver myself into your hands for judgment . As long as they speak for me I will continue to wage total war . " It sure as hell did n't sound like a bandit on the run , Michael thought , as Maria Lombardo 's proud face beamed at him . He felt an identification with her , she looked very much like his own mother . Her face was seamed with past sorrows , but her eyes blazed with a natural love for even more combat against herfate . Finally it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was surprised when Guiliano 's mother gave him a warmembrace . " You remind me of my son , " she said . " I trust you . " She went to the mantel and took down a wooden statue of the Virgin Mary . It was black . The features were Negroid . " Take this as a gift . It is the only thing I own worthy to give you . " Michael tried to refuse , but she pressed it on him . Hector Adonis said , " There are only a few of those statuesleft in Sicily . Curious , but we are very close to Africa . " Guiliano 's mother said , " It does n't matter what she lookslike , you can pray to her . " 42 43BOOKIITURI GUILIANO1943M A R I O P U Z O " Yes , " Pisciotta said . " She can do as much good as the other . " There was contempt in his voice . Michael watched Pisciotta take his leave of Guiliano 's mother . He could see the real affection between them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But she put her head on his shoulder for a brief moment and said , " Aspanu , Aspanu , I love you as I love my son . Do n't let them kill Turi . " She was weeping . Pisciotta lost all his coldness , his body seemed to crumple , his dark bony face softened . " You will all grow old in America , " he said . Then he turned to Michael . " I will bring Turi to you within the week , " he said . He went out the door quickly and silently . He had his own special red-bordered pass and he could melt again into the mountains . Hector Adonis would remain with the Guilianos , though he owned a house in town . Michael and Stefan Andolini got into the Fiat and drove through the central square and onto the road that led to Castelvetranoand the coastal city of Trapani . With Andolini 's slow tentative driving and the numerous military roadblocks , it was noon before they came to the town of Trapani. 44CHAPTERzIN SEPTEMBER of 1943 Hector @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Palermo . His extremely short stature caused his colleagues to treat him with less respect than his talents deserved . But this was foreordained in the Sicilianculture , which commonly and brutally based nicknames on physical shortcomings . The one person who knew his true value was the President of the University . In this September of 1943 , Hector Adonis ' life was about to change . For southern Italy , the war was over . The American Army had already conquered Sicily and gone on to the mainland . Fascism was dead , Italy was reborn ; for the first time in fourteen centuries , the island of Sicily had no real master . But Hector Adonis , knowing the ironies of history , had no great hopes . The Mafia had already begun to usurp the rule of law in Sicily . Their cancerous power would be as deadly as that of any corporate state . From his office window he looked down on the grounds of the University , at the few buildings that could be called a campus . There was no need for dormitories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and America . Here most students studied at home and consulted with their professors at stated intervals . The professors gave lectures which students could ignore with impunity . They needed only to take their exams . It was a system47M A R I O P U Z O THE S I C I L I A Nthat Hector Adonis thought disgraceful in general and stupid in particular as it affected Sicilians , who , he thought , required a pedagogical discipline even more severe than students in othercountries . Watching from his cathedral-like window he could see the seasonal influx of Mafia chiefs from all the provinces of Sicily , come to make their lobbying calls on the professors of the University . Under Fascist rule , these Mafia chiefs had been more circumspect , more humble , but now under the beneficent rule of American-restored democracy , they had risen like worms strugglingthrough rain-broken earth and resumed their old ways . They were no longer humble . The Mafia chiefs , the Friends of the Friends , heads of small local clans in the many villages of Sicily , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who were relatives or sons of wealthy landowners , or sons of friends , who were failing in their courses at the University , who would not get degrees unless some firm action was taken . And these degrees were of the utmost importance . How else would families get rid of sons who had no ambition , no talent , no intelligence ? Parents would have to support sons the rest of their lives . But with degrees , slips of parchment from the University , these same rascals could becometeachers , doctors , members of Parliament , or if worse came to worst , minor administrative functionaries of the state . Hector Adonis shrugged ; history consoled him . His beloved British , in their greatest days of Empire , had entrusted their armies to equally incompetent sons of the rich , whose parents bought them commissions in the army and the commands of great ships . Still the Empire had prospered . True these commandershad led their men to unnecessary slaughters , yet it must be said that the commanders had died with their men , bravery had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had at least solved the problem of incompetent and feckless men becoming a burden to the state . Italians were not so chivalrous or so coldly practical . They loved their children , saved them from personal disasters and let the state look after itself . From his window , Hector Adonis could spot at least three local Mafia chiefs wandering around looking for their victims . They wore cloth caps and leather boots and carried over their arms heavy velvet jackets , for the weather was still warm . They carried baskets of fruit , bamboo jacketed bottles of home-grown wine to give as gifts . Not bribes but courteous antidotes for the terror that would rise in the breasts of the professors at the sight of them . For most of the professors were natives of Sicily and understood that the requests could never be refused . One of the Mafia chiefs , in dress so countrified he could have stepped onto the stage of Cavalleria Rusticana , was entering the building and ascending the stairs . Hector Adonis prepared , with sardonic pleasure , to play the familiar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name was Buccilla and he owned a farm and sheep in a town called Partinico , not far from Montelepre . They shook hands and Buccilla handed him the basket he was carrying . " We have so much fruit dropping to the ground and rotting that I thought , I 'll carry some to the Professor , " Buccilla said . He was a short but broad man , his body powerful from a lifetime of hard work . Adonis knew he had a reputation for honesty , that he was a modest man though he could have turned his power into riches . He was a throwback to the old Mafia chiefs who fought not for riches but for respect and honor . Adonis smiled as he accepted the fruit . What peasant in Sicily ever let anything go to waste ? There were a hundred children for each olive that fell to the ground , and these children werelike locusts . Buccilla sighed . He was affable , but Adonis knew this affabilitycould turn to menace in the fraction of a second . So he flashed a sympathetic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is . I have work to do on my land and yet when my neighbor asked me to do this little favor , how could I refuse ? My father knew his father , my grandfather his grandfather . And it is my nature , perhaps my misfortune that I will do anything a friend Asks me to do . After all , are we not Christians together ? " 48 49MARIO PUZO Hector Adonis said smoothly , " We Sicilians are all the same . We are too generous . That is why the northerners in Rome take such a shameful advantage of us . " Buccilla stared at him shrewdly . There would be no trouble here . And had n't he heard somewhere that this professor was one of the Friends ? Certainly he did not seem frightened . And if he was a Friend of the Friends , why had not he , Buccilla , known this fact ? But there were many different levels in the Friends . In any event , here was a man who understood the world he lived in . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " As one Sicilian to another . My neighbor 's son failed at the University this year . You failed him . So my neighbor claims . But when I heard your name I said to him , What ! Signor Adonis ? Why , that man has the best heart in the world . He could never do such an unkindness if he knew all the facts . Never . ' And so they begged me with tears to tell you the whole story . And to ask with the utmost humbleness to change his grade so that he can go into the world to earn his bread . " Hector Adonis was not deceived by this exquisite politeness . Again it was like the English he so much admired , those people who could be so subtly rude that you basked in their insults for days before you realized they had mortally wounded you . A figure of speech in regard to the English , but with Signor Buc- cilla , his request , if denied , would be followed by the blast of a lupara on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ olives and berries in the basket . " Ah , we ca n't let a young man starve in this terrible world , " he said . " What is the fellow 's name ? " And when Buccilla told him , he took up a ledger from the bottom of his desk . He leafed through it , though of course he knew the name well . The failed student was a lout , an oaf , a lummox ; more a brute than the sheep on Buccilla 's farm . He was a lazy womanizer , a shiftless braggart , a hopeless illiterate who did not know the difference between the Iliad and Verga . Despite all this , Hector 505IAdonis smiled sweetly at Buccilla and in a tone of the utmost surprise said , " Ah , he had a little trouble with one of his examinations . But it is easily put to order . Have him come see me and I will prepare him in these very rooms and then give him an extra examination . He will not fail again . " They shook hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hector thought . What did it signify that all these young goodfor-nothingsgot University degrees they did not earn or deserve ? In the Italy of 1943 they could use them to wipe their pampered asses and decline into positions of mediocrity . The ringing phone broke his train of thought and brought a different irritation . There was a short ring , then a pause before three curter rings . The woman at the switchboard was gossiping with someone and flipped her tab between the pauses in her own conversation . This exasperated him so that he shouted , " Pronto " into the phone more rudely than was seemly . And unfortunately it was the President of the University calling . But the President , a notorious stickler for professional courtesy , obviously had more important things on his mind than rudeness . His voice was quivering with fear , almost tearful in its supplication . " My dear Professor Adonis , " he said , " could I trouble you to come to my office ? The University has a grave problem that only you may be able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , my dear Professor , you will have my gratitude. " ' this obsequiousness made Hector Adonis nervous . What did the idiot expect of him ? To jump over the Cathedral of Palermo ? The President would be better qualified , Adonis thought bitterly , he was at least six feet . Let him jump and not ask a subordinate with the shortest legs in Sicily to do his job for him . This image put Adonis into a good humor again . So he asked mildly , " Perhapsyou could give me a hint . Then on my way I might prepare myself . " l'he President 's voice sank to a whisper . " The estimable Don ( ' roce has honored us with a visit . His nephew is a medicalM A R I O P U Z O student , and his professor suggested he retire gracefully from the program . Don Croce has come to beg us in the most cour- teous way possible to reconsider . However , the professor in the Medical College insists that the young man resign . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Young Doctor Nattore , " the President said . " An estimable member of the faculty but as yet a little unworldly . " " I shall be in your office within five minutes , " Hector Adonis said . As he hurried across the open ground to the main building , Hector Adonis pondered what course of action to take . The difficulty lay not with the President ; he had always summoned Adonis on matters such as these . The difficulty lay with Doctor Nattore . He knew the Doctor well . A brilliant medical man , a teacher whose death would definitely be a loss to Sicily , his resignation a loss to the University . Also that most pompous of bores , a man of inflexible principles and true honor . But even he must have heard of the great Don Croce , even he must have a grain of common sense embedded in his genius brain . There must be something else . In front of the main building was a long black car and leaning against it were two men dressed in business suits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the Don 's body- guards and chauffeur left down here out of respect for the aca- demics Don Croce was visiting . Adonis saw their looks of astonishment and then amusement at his small stature , his per- fect tailoring , the briefcase under his arm . He flashed a cold stare which startled them . Could such a small man be a Friend of the Friends ? The office of the President looked more like a library than a business center ; he was a scholar more than an administrator . Books lined all the walls , the furniture was massive but com- fortable . Don Croce sat in a huge chair sipping his espresso . His face reminded Hector Adonis of the prow of a ship in the Iliad , warped by years of battle and hostile seas . The Don pretended they had never met , and Adonis allowed himself to be introduced . The President of course knew this was a farce , but young Doctor Nattore was taken in . The President was the tallest man at the University ; Hector Adonis was the shortest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and slumped in his chair before he spoke . " We have a small disagreement , " the President said . At this Doctor Nattore snorted with exasperation , but Don Croce inclinedhis head slightly in accord . The President went on . " Don Croce has a nephew who yearns to be a doctor . Professor Nattoresays he does not have the necessary grades to be certified . A tragedy . Don Croce has been so kind as to come and present his nephew 's case , and since Don Croce has done so much for our University , I thought we should try our best to grant him some accommodation . " Don Croce said amiably without a hint of sarcasm , " I 'm illit- erate myself , yet no one can say I have been unsuccessful in the world of business . " Certainly , Hector Adonis thought , a man who could bribe ministers , order murders , terrify shopkeepers and factory owners did not have to read and write . Don Croce continued , " I found my path by experience . Why could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be heartbroken if her son does not have the word Doctor ' in front of his name . She is a true believer in Christ , she wants to help the world . " Doctor Nattore , with that insensitivity so common to one who is in the right , said , " I can not change my position . " Don Croce sighed . He said cajolingly , " What harm can my nephew do ? I will arrange a government post with the army , or with a Catholic hospital for the aged . He will hold their hands and listen to their troubles . He is extremely amiable , he will charm the old wrecks . What do I ask ? A little shuffling of the papers you shuffle here . " He glanced around the room , contemptuousof the books that formed its walls . Hector Adonis , extremely disturbed by this meekness of Don k r , Croce , a danger signal in such a man , thought angrily that it was52 53M A R I O P U Z Oeasy for the Don to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Switzerland at the slightest indisposition of his liver . But Adonis knew it was up to him to solve this impasse . " My dear Doctor Nattore , " he said , " surely we can do something . A little private tutoring , extra training at a charity hospi-tal ? " Despite his birth in Palermo , Doctor Nattore did not look Sicilian . He was fair and balding and he showed his anger , somethingno true Sicilian would ever do in this delicate situation . Doubtless it was the defective genes inherited from some longagoNorman conqueror . " You do n't understand , my dear ProfessorAdonis . The young fool wants to be a surgeon . " Jesus , Joseph , our Virgin Mary and all her Saints , Hector Adonis thought . This is real trouble . Taking advantage of the stunned silence on his colleague 's face , Doctor Nattore went on . " Your nephew knows nothing about anatomy . He hacked a cadaver to pieces as if he were carving a sheep for the spit . He misses most of his classes , he does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operating room as if he were going to a dance . I admit he is amiable , you could n't find a nicer chap . But , after all , we are talking about a man who will someday have to enter a human body with a sharp knife . " Hector Adonis knew exactly what Don Croce was thinking . Who cared how bad a surgeon the boy would make ? It was a matter of family prestige , the loss of respect if the boy failed . No matter how bad a surgeon , he would never kill as many as Don Croce 's more busy employees . Also , this young Doctor Nattore had not bent to his will , not taken the hint , that Don Croce was willing to let the surgeon business go by , that he was willing for his nephew to be a medical doctor . So now it was time for Hector Adonis to settle the issue . " My dear Don Croce , " he said , " I am sure that Doctor Nattore will accede to your wishes if we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of your nephew to be a surgeon ? As you say , THE S I C I L I A Nhe 's too amiable , and surgeons are born sadists . And who in Sicily voluntarily goes under the knife ? " He paused for a moment . Then he went on . " Also he must train in Rome , if we pass him here , and the Romans will use any excuse to demolish a Sicilian . You do your nephew a disservice to insist . Let me propose a compromise . " Doctor Nattore muttered that no compromise was possible . For the first time the lizardlike eyes of Don Croce flashed fire . Doctor Nattore fell silent and Hector Adonis rushed on . " Your nephew will receive passing marks to become a doctor , not a surgeon . We will say he has too kind a heart to cut . " Don Croce spread wide his arms , his lips parted in a cold smile . " You have defeated me with your good sense and your reasonableness , " he said to Adonis . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not a surgeon . And my sister must be content . " He made haste to leave them , his real purpose achieved ; he had not hoped for more . The President of the University escorted him down to the car . But everyone in that room noted the last glance l ) on Croce gave Doctor Nattore before he left . It was a glance of the closest scrutiny as if he were memorizing the features , to make sure that he did not forget the face of this man who had tried to thwart his will . When they had left , Hector Adonis turned to Doctor Nattore and said , " You , my dear colleague , must resign from the Universityand go practice your trade in Rome . " Doctor Nattore said angrily , " Are you mad ? " 1-lector Adonis said , " Not as mad as you . I insist you have dinner with me tonight and I will explain to you why our Sicily is no Garden of Eden . " " But why should I leave ? " Doctor Nattore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Don Croce Mato . Sicily is not big enough for both of you . " " But he 's gotten his way , " Doctor Nattore cried out in despair . " The nephew will become a doctor . You and the Presidenthave approved it . " 5455M A R I O P U Z O " But you did not , " Hector Adonis said . " We approved it to save your life . But still , you are now a marked man . " That evening Hector Adonis was host to six professors , includingDoctor Nattore , at one of Palermo 's best restaurants . Each of these professors had received a visit from a " man of honor " that day and each had agreed to change the marks of a failing pupil . Doctor Nattore listened to their stories with horror and then finally said , " But that can not be in a medical school , not a doctor , " until finally they lost their temper with him . A Professor of Philosophy demanded to know why the practice of medicine was more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the human mind and the immortal sanctity of one 's soul . When they were finished Doctor Nattore agreed to leave the University of Palermo and emigrate to Brazil , where , he was assured by his colleagues , a good surgeon could make his fortune in gall bladders . That night Hector Adonis slept the sleep of the just . But the next morning he received an urgent phone call from Montelepre . His godson , Turi Guiliano , whose intelligence he had nurtured , whose gentleness he had prized , whose future he had planned , had murdered a policeman . CHAPTER3MONTELEPRE WAS a town of seven thousand people , sunk as deeply in the valley of the Cammarata Mountains as it was in poverty . On the day of September 2 , 1943 , the citizens were preparing for their Festa , to start the next day and continue for the followingthree days . The Festa was the greatest event of the year in each town , greater than Easter or Christmas or New Year 's , greater than the days celebrating the end of the great war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Festa was dedicated to the town 's own particular favorite saint . It was one of the few customs the Fascist government of Mussolini had dared not meddle with or try to forbid . To organize the Festa , a Committee of Three was formed each year , composed of the most respected men of the town . These three men then appointed deputies to collect money and offeringsof goods . Every family contributed according to their means . In addition deputies were sent out into the streets to beg . ' Then as the great day approached , the Committee of Three . carted to spend the special fund accumulated over the past year . They hired a band , and they hired a clown . They set up generous money prizes for horse races to be held over the three days . They hired specialists to decorate the church and the57M A R I O P U Z O THE S I C I L I A Nstreets so that the grim poverty-stricken town of Montelepre suddenly looked like some medieval citadel in the midst of the Fields of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Food peddlers set up their booths . The families of Montelepre used the Festa to show their marriageabledaughters ; new clothes were bought , chaperones detailed . A bevy of prostitutes from Palermo set up a huge tent just outside of town , their licenses and medical certificates adorning the red- , white- , and green-striped canvas sides . A famous holy friar , who years ago had grown stigmata , was hired to preach the formal sermon . And finally , on the third day , the saint 's bier was carried through the streets followed by all the townspeople , with their livestock of mules , horses , pigs and donkeys . On top of the bier rode the effigy of the saint , crusted with money , flowers , varicolored sweets and great bamboosheathedbottles of wine . These few days were their days of glory . It did not matter that for the rest of the year they starved and that in the same village square where they honored the saint , they sold the sweat of their bodies to the land barons for a hundred lire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Festa , Turi Guiliano was designated to take part in the opening ritual , the mating of the Miracle Mule of Montelepre with the town 's largest and strongestdonkey . It is rare that a female mule can conceive ; they are classified as a sterile animal , product of the union between a mare and donkey . But there was such a mule in Montelepre ; it had borne a donkey two years before , and its owner had agreed , as his family 's duty share to the town Festa , to donate the mule 's services and , if the miracle should occur , its offspring to the next year 's Festa . There was in this particular ceremony a sardonic mockery . But the ritualistic mating was only partly a mockery . The Sicilian peasant has an affinity with his mule and donkey . They are hard-working beasts , and like the peasant himself have flinty , dour natures . Like the peasant they can work steadilyfor very long hours without breaking down , unlike the highernobilityhorse , who must be pampered . Also , they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ falling and breaking a leg , unlike the fiery stallions or the high-blooded , flighty mares . Also , peasant and donkey and mule subsist and thrive on food that kills other men and animals . But the greatest affinity was this : Peasant , donkey and mule had to be treated with affection and respect , otherwise they turned murderous and stubborn . The Catholic religious festivals had sprung from ancient pagan rituals to beg miracles from the gods . On this fateful day in September 1943 , during the Festa of the town of Montelepre , a miracle would occur that would change the fate of its seven thousand inhabitants . At twenty years of age Turi Guiliano was considered the bravest , the most honorable , the strongest , the young man who inspiredthe most respect . He was a man of honor . That is to say , a man who treated his fellow man with scrupulous fairness and one who could not be insulted with impunity . He had distinguished himself at the last harvest by refusing to he hired out as a laborer at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He then gave a speech to the other men urging them not to work , to let the harvest rot . The carabinieriarrested him on charges made by the Baron . The other men went back to work . Guiliano had not shown any hard feelingstoward these men or even the carabinieri . When he was released from prison through the intervention of Hector Adonis , he developed no rancor of any kind . He had stood up for his principles and that was enough for him . On another occasion , he had broken up a knife fight between Aspanu Pisciotta and another youth simply by interposing his unarmed body between them and with good-humored reasoning disarming their anger . What was unusual about this was that in any other person4 these actions would have been taken as signs of cowardice mas-M A R I O P U Z O querading as humanity , but something in Guiliano forbade this interpretation . On this second day of September , Salvatore Guiliano , called Turi by his friends and family , was brooding over what was to him a devastating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little thing . The town of Montelepre had no movie theater , no community hall , but there was one little cafe with a billiard table . The night before , Turi Guiliano , his cousin Gaspare " Aspanu " Pisciotta and a few other youths had been playing billiards . Some of the older men of the town had been watching them while drinking glasses of wine . One of the men , by the name of Guido Quintana , was slightly drunk . He was a man of reputation . He had been imprisoned by Mussolini for being a suspected member of the Mafia . The American conquest of the island had resulted in his being released as a victim of fascism , and it was rumored that he was going to be named as Mayor of Montelepre . As well as any Sicilian , Turi Guiliano knew the legendary power of the Mafia . In these past few months of freedom , its snakelike head had begun weaving over the land , as if fertilized by the fresh loam of a new democratic government . It was al- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ante " to certain " men of respect . " And of course Turi knew the history , the countless murders of peasants who tried to col- lect their wages from powerful nobles and landlords , how tightly the Mafia had controlled the island before Mussolini had deci- mated them with his own disregard for the lawful process , like a deadlier snake biting a less powerful reptile with its poisoned fangs . So Turi Guiliano sensed the terror that lay ahead . Quintana now regarded Guiliano and his companions with a slightly contemptuous eye . Perhaps their high spirits irritated him . He was , after all , a serious man , about to embark on a pivotal part of his life : Exiled by Mussolini 's government to a desert island , he was now back in the town of his birth . His aim in the next few months was to establish respect in the eyes of the townspeople . 6o 61Or perhaps it was the handsomeness of Guiliano that irritated him , for Guido Quintana was an extremely ugly man . His appearancewas intimidating not from any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formidable front to the outside world . Or perhaps it was the natural antagonism of a born villain toward a born hero . In any case he got up suddenly just in time to jostle Guiliano as he went by to the other side of the billiard table . Turi , naturallycourteous to a much older man , made an apology that was gentle and sincere . Guido Quintana looked him up and down with contempt . " Why are n't you home sleeping and resting to earn your bread tomorrow ? " he said . " My friends have been waiting to play billiards for an hour . " He reached out and took the billiard cue from Guiliano 's hand and , smiling slightly , waved him away from the table . Everybody was watching . The insult was not mortal . If the man were younger or the insult more pointed , Guiliano would have been forced to fight and keep his reputation for manhood . Aspanu Pisciotta always carried a knife , and now he positioned himself to intercept Quintana 's friends if they decided to interfere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he expected his friend and cousin to finish the quarrel . But at that moment Guiliano felt a strange uneasiness . The man looked so intimidating and ready for the most serious consequences of any dispute . The companions in the background , also older men , were smiling in an amused way as if they had no doubt of the outcome . One of them wore hunting attire and carried a rifle . Guiliano himself was unarmed . And then for one shameful moment , he felt fear . He was not afraid of being hurt , of being struck , of finding this man was the stronger of the two . M It was the fear that these men knew what they were doing , that they had the situation under control . He did not . That they could Kin him down in the dark streets of Montelepre as he walkedE home . That he would appear a dead fool the next day . It was the inborn tactical sense of the born guerrilla soldier that madeSo Turi Guiliano took his friend by the arm and led him out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amazed that his friend had yielded so easily but never suspecting the fear . He knew Turi was good-hearted and assumed he did not wish to quarrel and injure another man over so small a thing . As they started up the Via Bella to their homes they could hear the click of billiard balls behind them . All that night Turi Guiliano had not been able to sleep . Had he really been afraid of that man with the evil face and threateningbody ? Had he shivered like a girl ? Were they all laughing at him ? What did his best friend , his cousin , Aspanu , think of him now ? That he was a coward ? That he , Turi Guiliano , the leader of the youth of Montelepre , the most respected , the one acknowledged as the strongest and most fearless , had buckled at the first threat of a true man ? And yet , he told himself , why risk a vendetta that could lead to death over the small matter of a billiard game , an older man 's irascible rudeness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another youth . He had known that this quarrel could be serious . He had known that these men were with the Friends of the Friends , and it had made him afraid . Guiliano slept badly and woke in that sullen mood so dangerousin adolescent males . He seemed to himself ridiculous . He had always wanted to be a hero , like most young men . If he had lived in any other part of Italy he would have become a soldier long before , but as a true Sicilian he had not volunteered , and his godfather , Hector Adonis , had made certain arrangements so that he would n't be called . After all , though Italy governed Sicily , no true Sicilian felt he was an Italian . And then , if the truth be told , the Italian government itself was not so anxious to draft Sicilians , especially in the last year of the war . Sicilians had too many relatives in America , Sicilians were born criminals and renegades , Sicilians were too stupid to be trained in modern warfare and they caused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt his moodiness fade with the sheer beauty of the day . The golden sun was glorious , the smellof lemon and olive trees filled the air . He loved the town of Montelepre , its crooked streets , the stone houses with their balconiesfilled with those gaudy flowers that grew in Sicily without the slightest encouragement . He loved the red-tiled roofs that stretched away to the end of the small town , buried in this deep alley on which the sun poured like liquid gold . The elaborate decorations of the Festa  --  the streets overhung with an aerial maze of colorful papier-mache saints , the houses decorated with great bamboo-strutted flowers  --  disguised the essential poverty of what was a typical Sicilian town . Perched high , yet shyly hidden in the creases of the surrounding mountains , its garlanded houses were mostly filled with men , women , children and animals occupying three or four rooms . Many houses had no sanitation , and even the thousands of flowers and the cold mountain air could not overcome the smell of offal that ) se with the sun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Theomen sat in wooden chairs on their cobbled terraces preparing food for their tables , also set outside the door . Young childrenlied the streets chasing chickens , turkeys , young goats ; olderhildren wove bamboo baskets . At the end of the Via Bella , before it emptied into the square , was a huge demon-faced fountain , built by the Greeks two thousand years before , water pouringfrom its rock-toothed mouth . Alongside the surrounding mountains green gardens grew precariously , built on terraces. r nthe plains below were the visible towns of Partinico and ustellammare ; the bloody dark stone town of Corleone lurked urderously beyond the horizon . From the far end of the Via Bella , the end of the street that led into the road of the Casteilammare plain , Turi could seespanu Pisciotta leading a small donkey . For a moment he was , % orried about how Aspanu would treat him after his humiliation of the night before . His friend was noted for his sharp wit . Would he make some contemptuous remark ? Guiliano felt again the rush of futile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ R I O P U Z Oagain . There would be no regard for any consequences , he would show them all he was no coward . Yet in a corner of his mind he saw the whole scene sharp and clear . Quintana 's friends waiting behind him , one of them with a hunting rifle . They were Friends of the Friends and would avenge themselves . He did not fear them , he feared only his defeat by them , which seemed so sure because though they were not so strong , they were more cruel . Aspanu Pisciotta wore his wickedly cheery grin as he said , " Turi , this little donkey ca n't do it all by himself . We 'll have to help . " Guiliano did n't bother to answer ; he was relieved that his friend had forgotten about last night . It always touched his heart that Aspanu , who was so caustic and penetrating with the faults of others , never treated him with anything but the utmost affectionand respect . They walked together toward the town square , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pilot fish . The children knew what was going to happen with the donkey and were wild with excitement . For them it would be a great treat , an exciting event in the usually dull summer day . A small platform four feet high stood in the town square . It was formed by heavy blocks of stone carved from the mountains around them . Turi Guiliano and Aspanu Pisciotta pushed the donkey up the dirt ramp of the platform . They used a rope to tie the donkey 's head to a short vertical iron bar . The donkey sat down . There was a patch of white skin over his eyes and muzzle that gave him a clownish look . The children gathered around the platform , laughed and jeered . One of the little boys called out , " Which one is the donkey ? " and all the children laughed . Turi Guiliano , not knowing this was the last day of his life as an unknown village boy , looked down on the scene with the sweet possessive contentment of a man placed exactly as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of earth in which he had been born and spent his life . The outside world could never harm him . Even the humiliation of the night before had disap-6465peared . He knew those looming limestone mountains as intimatelyas a little child knew his sandbox . Those mountains grew slabs of stone as easily as they grew grass , and formed caves and hiding places that could shelter an army . Turi Guiliano knew every house , every farm , every laborer , and all the ruined castlesleft by the Normans and Moors , the skeletons of beautifully decayed temples left by the Greeks . From another entrance to the square appeared a farmer leadingthe Miracle Mule . This was the man who had employed them for this morning 's work . His name was Papera , and he was held in much respect by the citizens of Montelepre for having waged a successful vendetta against a neighbor . They had quarreled over an adjoining piece of land which held an olive grove . The quarrel went on for ten years , had in fact lasted longer than all of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shortly after the Allied Armies had liberated Sicily and installed a democratic government , the neighbor had been found almost cut in two by the blast of a lupara , the sawed-off shotgun so popular in Sicily for such matters . Suspicion immediately fell on Papera , but he had conveniently allowed himself to be arrested in a quarrel with the carabinieri and had spent the night of the murder safely in the prison cell of the Bellampo Barracks . It was rumored that this was the first sign of the old Mafia coming to life , that Papera  --  related by marriage to Guido Quintana  --  had enlisted the Friends of the Friends to help settle the quarrel . As Papera led the mule to the front of the platform , the childrenswarmed around it so that Papera had to scatter them with mild curses and casual waves of the whip he held in his hand . The children escaped the whip easily as Papera snapped it over their heads with a good-humored smile . Smelling the female mule below , the white-faced donkey reared against the rope that held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up as the children cheered . Meanwhile Papera was maneuvering the mule to present its hindquarters to the cdte of the platform . At this point Frisella , the barber , came out of his shop to joinM A R I O P U Z Oin the fun . Behind him was the Maresciallo , pompous and important , rubbing his smooth red face . He was the only man in Montelepre who had himself shaved every day . Even on the platform Guiliano could smell the strong cologne with which the barber had showered him . Maresciallo Roccofino cast a professional eye over the crowd that had accumulated in the square . As the Commander of the local National Police detachment twelve men strong he was responsiblefor law and order in the town . The Festa was always a troublesome time , and he had already ordered a four-man patrol for the town square , but they had not yet arrived . He also watched the town benefactor , Papera , with his Miracle Mule . He was certain that Papera had ordered the murder of his neighbor . These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liberties . They would all regret the loss of Mussolini , the Maresciallo thought grimly . Compared with the Friends of the Friends , the dictator would be remembered as another gentle Saint Francis of Assisi . Frisella the barber was the buffoon of Montelepre . Idle men who could not find work clustered in his shop to hear his jokes and listen to his gossip . He was one of those barbers who servicedhimself better than his customers . His mustache was exquisitelytrimmed , his hair pomaded and strictly combed , but he had the face of a clown in the puppet shows . Bulbous nose ; a wide mouth that hung open like a gate and a lower jaw without a chin . Now he shouted , " Turi , bring your beasts into my shop and I 'll anoint them with perfume . Your donkey will think he 's makinglove to a duchess . " Turi ignored him . Frisella had cut his hair when he was a little boy , and so badly that his mother had taken over the task . But his father still went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own tales about America to awestruck listeners . Turi Guiliano did not like the barber because Frisella had been a strong Fascist and was reputed to be a confidant of the Friends of the Friends. 66THE S I C I L I A NThe Maresciallo lit a cigarette and strutted up the Via Bella not even noticing Guiliano  --  an oversight he was to regret in the weeks to come . The donkey was now trying to jump off the platform . Guiliano let the rope slacken so that Pisciotta could lead the animal to the edge and position it above where the Miracle Mule was standing . The mare 's hindquarters were just above the edge of the platform . Guiliano let the rope slacken a little more . The mare gave a great snort and pushed her rump back at the same moment the donkey plunged downward . The donkey grasped the hindquartersof the mare with his forelegs , gave a few convulsive jumps and hung in midair with a comical look of bliss on his whitepatchedface . Papera and Pisciotta were laughing as Guiliano pulled savagely on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ iron bar . The crowd cheered and shouted blessings . The children were already scattering through the streets in search of other amusements . Papera , still laughing , said , " If we could all live like donkeys , eh , what a life . " Pisciotta said disrespectfully , " Signor Papera , let me load your back with bamboo and olive baskets and beat you up the mountain roads for eight hours every day . That 's a donkey 's life . " The farmer scowled at him . He caught the sly reproach , that he was paying them too little for this job . He had never liked Pisciotta and had in fact given Guiliano the job . Everybody in the town of Montelepre was fond of Turi . But Pisciotta was another matter . His tongue was too sharp and his manner too languid . Lazy . The fact that he had a weak chest was no excuse . He could still smoke cigarettes , court the loose girls of Palermo and dress like a dandy . And that clever little mustache in the French @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the devil with his weak chest , Papera thought . He gave them their two hundred lire , for which Guiliano thanked him courteously , and then took himself and his mare back on the road to his farm . The two young men untied the donkey and led it back to Guili-67M A R I O P U Z Oano 's house . The donkey 's work had just begun ; he had a much less pleasant task before him . Guiliano 's mother had an early lunch waiting for the two boys . Turi 's two sisters , Mariannina and Giuseppina , were helping their mother make pasta for the evening meal . Eggs and flour were mixed into a huge mountain on a shellacked square wooden board , kneaded solid . Then a knife was used to cut the sign of the cross into the dough to sanctify it . Next Mariannina and Giuseppina cut off strips they rolled around a blade of sisal grass , and then pulled out the grass to leave a hole in the tube of dough . Huge bowls of olives and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the fields , a short working day so he could join the Festa in the afternoon . On the next day Marianninawas to become engaged and there was to be a special party at the Guiliano house . Turi had always been Maria Lombardo Guiliano 's most belovedchild . The sisters remembered him as a baby being bathed every day by the mother . The tin basin carefully warmed by the stove , the mother testing the temperature of the water with her elbow , the special soap fetched from Palermo . The sisters had been jealous at first , then fascinated by the mother 's tender washing of the naked male infant . He never cried as a baby , was always gurgling with laughter as his mother crooned over him and declared his body perfect . He was the youngest in the family but grew to be the most forceful . And he was to them always a little strange . He read books and talked about politics , and of course it was always remarked that his height and formidable physique came from his time in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his gentleness and his selflessness . On this morning , the women were worried about Turi and watched him with a loving fretfulness as he ate his bread and goat cheese , his plate of olives , drank his coffee made of chicory . As soon as he finished his lunch he and Aspanu would take the donkey all the way to Corleone and smuggle back a huge wheel of cheese and some hams and sausage . He would miss a68THE S I C I L I A Nday of the Festa to do this just to please his mother and make his sister 's engagement party a success . Part of the goods they would sell for cash on the black market for the family coffers . These three women loved to see the two young men together . They had been friends since they were little children , closer than brothers in spite of being such opposites . Aspanu Pisciotta , with his dark coloring , his thin movie star mustache , the extraordinarymobility of his face , the brilliant dark eyes and jet black hair on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And yet in some curious way all this flamboyance was overwhelmedby Turi Guiliano 's quiet Grecian beauty . He was massivelybuilt like the ancient Greek statues scattered all over Sicily . And his coloring was all light brown  --  his hair , his tawny skin . He was always very still , and yet when he moved it was with a startling quickness . But his most dominating feature was his eyes . They were a dreamy golden brown , and when they were averted they seemed ordinary . But when he looked at you directly the lids came halfway down like the lids carved in statuesand the whole face took on a quiet masklike serenity . While Pisciotta kept Maria Lombardo amused , Turi Guiliano went upstairs to his bedroom to prepare himself for the journey he was about to make . Specifically to get the pistol he kept hidden there . Remembering the humiliation of the previous night , he was determined to go armed on the job he had ahead this day . He knew how to shoot , for his father took him hunting often . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to say goodbye . She embraced him and felt the pistol he had in his waistband . " Turi , be careful , " she said , alarmed . " Do n't quarrel with the carabinieri . If they stop you , give up what you have . " Guiliano reassured her . " They can take the goods , " he said . " But I wo n't let them beat me or take me to prison . " She understood this . And in her own fierce Sicilian pride was proud of him . Many years ago her own pride , her anger at her69MARIO Puzopoverty , had led her to persuade her husband to try a new life in America . She had been a dreamer , she had believed in justice and her own rightful place in the world . She had saved a fortune in America , and that same pride had made her decide to return to Sicily to live like a queen . And then everything had turned to ashes . The lira became worthless in wartime , and she was poor again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her children . And she was happy when Turi showed the same spirit that had possessed her . But she dreaded the day when he must come into conflict with the stone-hard realities of life in Sicily . She watched him go out into the cobbled street of the Via Bella to greet Aspanu Pisciotta . Her son , Turi , walked like a huge cat , his chest so broad , his arms and legs so muscular he made Aspami seem no more than a stalk of sisal grass . Aspanu had the haul cunning that her son lacked , the cruelty in his cow age . Aspanu would guilt d Puri against the treacherous world they all had to live in . And she had a weakness for Aspam1'solive shinned prettiness , though she believed her son more handsome . She watched them go up the Via Bella to where it led out of town toward the Castellanunare plain . Her son , Turi Guiliano , and her sister 's son , Gaspare Pisciotta . Two young men just barely twenty years old , and seeming younger than their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them both . Finally the two men and their donkey vanished over a rise in the street , but she kept watching and finally they appeared again , high above the town of Montelepre , entering the range of mountains that surrounded the town . Maria Lombardo Guiliano kept watching , as if she would never see them again , until they disappeared in the late morning mist around the mountaintop . They were vanishing into the beginning of their myth . CHAPTER4IN SICILY this September of 1943 , people could only exist by trading in the black market . Strict rationing of foodstuffs still carried over from the war , and farmers had to turn in their produce to central government storehouses at fixed prices and for paper money that was almost worthless . In turn the government was supposed to sell and distribute these foodstuffs at low prices to the people . Under this system everybody would get enough to remain alive . In reality , the farmers hid what they could because what they turned in to the government storehouseswas appropriated by Don Croce Maio and his mayors to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then had to buy on the black market and break smuggling laws merely to exist . If they were caught doing this they were prosecuted and sent to jail . What good was it that a democratic government had been established in Rome ? They would be able to vote as they starved . Turi Guiliano and Aspanu Pisciotta , with the lightest of hearts , were in the process of breaking these laws . It was Pisciottawho had all the black market contacts and who had arrangedthis affair . He had contracted with a farmer to smuggle a great wheel of cheese from the countryside to a black market dealer in Montelepre . Their pay for this would be four smoked hams and a basket of sausage which would make his sister'sM A R I O P U Z Oengagement party a great celebration . They were breaking two laws , one forbidding dealing in the black market , the other smuggling from one province of Italy to another . There was not much the authorities could do to enforce the black market laws ; they would have had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Patrols of National Police , the carabinieri , roamed the countryside , set up roadblocks , paid informers . They could not of course interfere with the caravans of Don Croce Maio who used American Army trucks and special militarygovernment passes . But they could net many of the small farmers and starving villagers . It took them four hours to get to the farm . Guiliano and Pisciottapicked up the huge grainy white cheese and the other goods and strapped them onto the donkey . They formed a camouflageof sisal grass and bamboo stalks over the goods so that it would appear they were merely bringing in fodder for the livestock kept in the households of many villagers . They had the carelessness and confidence of youth , of children really , who hide treasures from their parents , as if the intention to deceive were enough . Their confidence came too from the knowledge that they could find hidden paths through the mountains . As they set out for the long journey home , Guiliano sent Pisciottaahead to scout for the carabinieri . They had arranged a set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carried the cheeses easily and behaved amiably  --  he had had his reward before setting out . They journeyed for two hours , slowly ascending , before there was any sign of danger . Then Guiliano saw behind them , perhaps three miles away , following their path , a caravan of six mules and a man on horseback . If the path was known to others in the black market , it could have been marked by the field police for a roadblock . As a caution , he sent Pisciotta scouting far ahead . After an hour he caught up with Aspanu , who was sitting on a huge stone smoking a cigarette and coughing . Aspanu looked pale ; he should not have been smoking . " Puri Guiliano sat down72THE S I C I L I A Nbeside him to rest . One of their strongest bonds since childhood was that they never tried to command each other in any way , so Turi said nothing . Finally Aspanu stubbed out the cigarette and put the blackened butt into his pocket . They started walking again , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They were traveling a mountain path that bypassed the roads and little villages but sometimes they saw an ancient Greek water cistern that spouted water through a crumpled statue 's mouth , or the remains of a Norman castle that many centuries ago had barred this way to invaders . Again Turi Guiliano dreamed of Sicily 's past and his future . He thought of his godfather , Hector Adonis , who had promised to come after the Festa and prepare his application to the University of Palermo . And when he thought of his godfather he felt momentary sadness . Hector Adonis never came to the Festas ; the drunken men would make fun of his short stature , the children , some of them taller than he , would offer him some insult . Turi wondered about God stunting the growth of a man 's body and bursting his brain with knowledge . For Turi thought Hector Adonis the most brilliantman in the world and loved him for the kindness he had showed him and his parents . He thought of his father working so hard on their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their threadbare clothes . It was lucky that Mariannina was so beautiful that she had caught a husband despite her poverty and the unsettled times . But most of all he anguished over his mother , Maria Lombardo . Even as a child he had recognized her bitterness , her unhappiness . She had tasted the rich fruits of America and could no longer be happy in the poverty-stricken towns of Sicily . His father would tell the tales of those glorious days and his mother would burst into tears . But he would change his family 's fortune , Turi Guiliano thought . He would work hard and study hard and he would become as great a man as his godfather. 73M AR 1 0 P U Z OSuddenly they were passing through a stand of trees , a small forest , one of the few left in this part of Sicily , which now seemed to grow only the great white stones and marble quarries . On the other side of the mountain they would begin the descent into Montelepre and would have to be careful of the roving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were coming to the Quattro Moline , the Four Crossroads , and it would pay to be a little careful here too . Guiliano pulled on the donkey 's bridle and motioned Aspanu to halt . They stood there quietly . No strange sound could be heard , only the steady hum of the countless insects that swarmed over the ground , their whirring wings and legs buzzing like a far distant saw . They moved forward over the crossroads and then safely out of sight into another small forest . Turi Guiliano started to daydream again . The trees widened out suddenly , as if they had been pushed back , and they were picking their way across a small clearing with a rough floor of tiny stones , cropped bamboo stalks , thin balding grass . The late afternoon sun was falling far away from them and looked pale and cold above the granite-studded mountains . Past this clearing the path would begin to drop in a long winding spiral to the town of Montelepre . Suddenly Guiliano came out of his dreams . A flash of light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He jerked the donkey to a halt and held up his hand to Aspanu . Only thirty yards away , strange men stepped out from behind a thicket . There were three of them , and Turi Guiliano saw their stiff black military caps , the black uniforms with white piping . He felt a sick foolish feeling of despair , of shame , that he had been caught . The three men fanned out as they advanced , weaponsat the ready . Two were quite young with ruddy shining faces and crusted military caps tilted almost comically to the backs of their heads . They seemed earnest yet gleeful as they pointed their machine pistols . The carabiniere in the center was older and held a rifle . HisTHE S I C I L I A Nface was pockmarked and scarred and his cap was pulled firmly over his eyes . He had sergeant 's stripes on his sleeve . The flash of light Guiliano had seen was a sunbeam drawn by the steel rifle barrel . This man was smiling grimly , his rifle pointed unwaveringlyat Guiliano 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smile . The Sergeant with the rifle stepped closer , his two fellow guards closing in from either side . Now Turi Guiliano was alert . The two young carabinieri with their machine pistols were not so much to be feared ; they were carelessly approaching the donkey , not taking their prisoners seriously . They motioned Guiliano and Pisciotta away from the donkey and one of them let his pistol sway back on its sling as he stripped the camouflage bamboo from the donkey 's back . When he saw the goods he let out a whistle of greedy delight . He did n't notice Aspanu edging closer to him but the Sergeant with the rifle did . He shouted , " You , with the mustache , move away , " and Aspanu stepped back closer to Turi Guiliano . The Sergeant moved a little closer . Guiliano watched him intently . The pockmarked face seemed to be fatigued ; but the man 's eyes gleamed when he said , " Well , young fellows , that 's a nice bit of cheese . We could use it in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell us the name of the farmer you got it from and we 'll let you ride your donkey back home . " They did not answer him . He waited . Still they did not answer . Finally , Guiliano said quietly , " I have a thousand lire as a gift , if you can let us go . " " You can wipe your ass with lire , " the Sergeant said . " Now , your identity papers . If they 're not in order I 'll make you shit and wipe your ass with them too . " The insolence of the words , the insolence of those black-andwhitepiped uniforms , aroused an icy fury in Guiliano . At that moment he knew he would never allow himself to be arrested , never allow these men to rob him of his family 's food . MARIO PII zoTuri Guiliano took out his identity card and started to approachthe Sergeant . He was hoping to get under the arc of the pointed rifle . He knew his physical coordination was faster than that of most men and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rifle motioned him back . The man said ,  --  Throw it on the ground . " Guiliano did so . Pisciotta , five paces on Guiliano 's left , and knowing what was in his friend 's mind , knowing he carried the pistol under his shirt , tried to distract the Sergeant 's attention . He said with studied insolence , his body thrust forward , hand on hip touching the knife he carried in a sheath strapped to his back , " Sergeant , if we give you the farmer 's name , why do you need our identity cards ? A bargain 's a bargain . " He paused for a moment and said sarcastically , " We know a carabiniere always keeps his word . " He spat out the word " carabiniere " with hatred . The rifleman sauntered a few steps toward Pisciotta . He stopped . He smiled and leveled his gun . He said , " And you , my little dandy , your card . Or do you have no papers , like your donkey , who has a better mustache @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pisciotta 's eyes glittered . He took a step toward the Sergeant . " No , I have no papers . And I know no farmer . We found these goods lying in the road . " The very foolhardiness of this defiance defeated its purpose . Pisciotta had wanted the rifleman to move closer within striking distance , but now the Sergeant took a few steps backward and smiled again . He said , " The bastinado will knock out some of your Sicilian insolence . " He paused for a moment and then said . " Both of you , lie on the ground . " The bastinado was a term loosely used for a physical beating with whips and clubs . Guiliano knew some citizens of Monteleprewho had been punished in the Bellampo Barracks . They had returned to their homes with broken knees , heads swollen as big as melons , their insides injured so that they could never work again . The carabiniere would never do that to him . G u i l i -T H E S I C I L I A Nano @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lie down , put one hand on the ground and the other on his belt so that he could draw the pistol from beneath his shirt . The clearing was now bathed with the soft hazy light of beginning twilight , the sun far over the trees had dipped below the last mountain . He saw Pisciotta standing proudly , refusing the command . Surely they would not shoot him down over a piece of smuggled cheese . He could see the pistols trembling in the hands of the young guards . At that moment there was the braying of mules and the clatter of hooves from behind and bursting into the clearing came the caravan of mules that Guiliano had spotted on the road behind him that afternoon . The man on horseback leading it carried a lupara slung over his shoulder and looked huge in a heavy leather jacket . He jumped down off his horse and took a great wad of lire notes from one of his pockets and said to the carabinierewith the rifle , " So , you 've scooped up a few little sardinesthis time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first time the rifleman relaxed his vigilance to accept the money offeredto him . The two men were grinning at each other . The prisoners seemed to have been forgotten by everyone . Turi Guiliano moved slowly toward the nearest guard . Pisciottawas edging toward the nearest bamboo thicket . The guards did n't notice . Guiliano hit the nearest guard with his forearm , knocking him to the ground . He shouted to Pisciotta , " Run . " Pisciotta dove into the bamboo thicket and Guiliano ranto the trees . The remaining guard was too stunned or too ineptto bring his pistol around in time . Guiliano , about to plunge intothe shelter of the forest , felt a quick sense of exultation . Helaunched his body into midair to dive between two sturdy treesthat would shield him . As he did so he drew the pistol free frombeneath his shirt . But he had been right about the rifleman being the most dangerous . The Sergeant dropped the wad of money to the ground , swung his rifle up and very coolly shot . There was no mistaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bird . MARI0 I'UZ0 Guiliano heard the shot at the same time he felt his body wracked with pain , as if he had been hit with a giant club . He landed on the ground between the two trees and tried to get up , but could not . His legs were numb ; he could not make them move . Pistol in hand he twisted his body and saw the Sergeant shake his rifle in the air in triumph . And then Guiliano felt his trousers filling with blood , the liquid warm and sticky . In the fraction of a second before he pulled the trigger of his pistol , Turi Guiliano felt only astonishment . That they had shot him over a piece of cheese . That they had smashed the fabric of his family with such a cruel carelessness just because he was running away from such a small breaking of the law that every- one broke . His mother would weep to the end of her days . And now his body was awash in blood , he who had never done any- one any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fall , saw the Sergeant 's black cap with its white piping seem to fly in the air as the body with its mortal head wound crumpled and floated to the rock- filled earth . It was an impossible shot with a pistol at that range but it seemed to Guiliano that his own hand had traveled with the bullet and smashed it like a dagger through the Sergeant 's eye . A machine pistol began to pop but the bullets flew upward in harmless arcs , chattering like small birds . And then it was deadly still . Even the insects had stopped their incessant whir- ring . Turi Guiliano rolled into the bushes . He had seen the enemy 's face shatter into a mask of blood and that gave him hope . He was not powerless . He tried to get up again and this time his legs obeyed him . He began to run but only one leg sprang forward , the other dragged along the ground , which surprised him . His crotch was warm and sticky , his trousers soaked , his vision cloudy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was afraid he had circled back into the clearing again and tried to turn back . His body started to fall  --  not to the ground , but into an endless red-tinted black void , and then he knew he was falling forever . IN THE clearing the young guard took his hand off the trigger of his machine pistol and the chattering stopped . The smuggler rose from the ground with the huge wad of money in his hand and offered it to the other guard . The guard pointed his machine pistol at him and said , " You 're under arrest . " The smuggler said , " You only have to split it two ways now . Let me go on . " The guards looked down at the fallen Sergeant . There was no doubt he was dead . The bullet had smashed eye and socket to pieces , and the wound was bubbling with a yellow liquid into which a gecko was already dipping its feelers . The smuggler said , " I 'll go into the bushes after him , he 's hurt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be heroes . Just let me go . " The other guard picked up the identity card Turi had thrown down on the ground at the Sergeant 's command . He read it aloud , " Salvatore Guiliano , the town of Montelepre . " " No need to look for him now , " the other said . " We 'll report back to headquarters , that 's more important . " " Cowards , " the smuggler said . He thought for a moment of unslinging his lupara but saw that they were looking at him with hatred . He had insulted them . For that insult they made him load the Sergeant 's body onto his horse and made him walk back to their barracks . Before that they relieved him of his weapon . They were very skittish and he hoped they would not shoot him by mistake out of sheer nervousness . Aside from that he was not too concerned . He knew Maresciallo Roccofino of Monteleprevery well . They had done business before and they would do business again . In all that time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But he had heard everything they had said . He was lying78 79MAIt I0 I ' I ' , o in a deep grassy hollow , knife drawn . Ile was waiting for them to try hunting down Turi Guiliano , and he planned to ambush one of them and get his gun after he had cut his throat . There was a ferocity in his soul that banished all fear of death , and when he heard the smuggler offer to bring hack Turi 's carcass , he burned that man 's face forever in his brain . He was almost sorry they retreated to leave him alone on the mountainside . He felt a pang when they tied his donkey to the end of the mule train . But he knew that Turi was badly wounded and would need help . He circled around the clearing , running through the woods to get to the side where his comrade had disappeared . There was no sign of a body in the underbrush and he started to run down the path from which they had come . There were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boulder whose top shallowed out into a small basin . In that basin of rock was a small pool of almost black blood and the other side of the rock was smeared with long ropy gouts of blood that were bright red . He kept running and was caught by surprise when he saw Guiliano 's body sprawled across his path , the deadly pistol still clutched in his hand . He knelt and took the pistol and thrust it into his belt . At that moment Turi Guiliano 's eyes opened . The eyes were alive with an awesome hatred , but they were staring past Aspanu Pisciotta . Pisciotta almost wept with relief and tried to get him to his feet , but he was not strong enough . " Turi , try to get up , I 'll help you , " Pisciotta said . Guiliano pushed his hands against the earth and raised his body . Pisciotta put an arm around his waist and his hand became warm and wet . He jerked his hand away and pulled aside Guiliano 's shirt , and with horror he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He propped Guiliano up against a tree , ripped off his own shirt and shoved it into the hole to staunch the blood , tying the sleeves together around the waist . He put one arm around his friend 's middle and then with his free hand took Guiliano 's left hand and raised it high in the air . Thisbalanced them both as he guided Guiliano down the path with careful , mincing steps . From a distance it looked as if they were dancing together down the mountain . AND so Turi Guiliano missed the Festa of Saint Rosalie , which the citizens of Montelepre hoped would bring a miracle to theirtown . He missed the shooting contest which he surely would have won . He missed the horse races in which the jockeys hit opposingriders over the head with clubs and whips . He missed the purple , yellow and green rockets that exploded and tattooed thestar-filled sky . He never tasted the magical sweets made of almond paste molded into the form of carrots , bamboo stalks and red tomatoes , all so sweet they numbed your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ puppet knights of mythical romance , of Roland , Oliver and Charlemagne , their sugar swords studded with peppermints of ruby , emeralds of tiny fruit bits that the children brought home to bed to dream over before they went to sleep . At home his sister 's engagement party went on without him . The mating of the donkey and the Miracle Mule failed . There was no offspring . The citizens of Montelepre were disappointed . ' f hey did not know until years later that the Festa had produced its miracle in the person of the young man who had held thedonkey . CHAPTERTHE ABBOT made his evening tour of the Franciscan monastery , spurring his lazy , good-for-nothing monks to earn their daily bread . He checked the bins in the holy relic workshop and visited the bakery turning out huge crusty loaves for nearby towns . He inspected the produce garden and the bamboo basketsfilled to the brim with olives , tomatoes and grapes , looking for bruises on their satiny skins . His monks were all as busy as elves  --  though not so merry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ none of the joy necessary to serve God . The Abbot took a long black cheroot from beneath his cassock and strolled around the monastery grounds to sharpen his appetite for the evening meal . It was then that he saw Aspanu Pisciotta drag Turi Guiliano t hrough the monastery gates . The gatekeeper tried to keep them out , hut Pisciotta put a pistol to his tonsured head and he fell to his knees to say his last prayers . Pisciotta deposited Guiliano 's bloody , almost lifeless , body at the Abbot 's feet . The Abbot was a tall , emaciated man with an elegant monkeylikeface , all tiny bones , a nub of a nose and querying little brown buttons for eyes . Though seventy years of age , he was vigorous , his mind as sharp and cunning as in the old days before Mussolini , when he had written elegant ransom notes for Mafia kidnappers who employed him. 82Now though it was known to all , peasants and authorities alike , that his monastery was the headquarters of black market operators and smugglers , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of respect for his holy calling , and a feeling that he deserved some material reward for his spiritual guidance to the community . So the Abbot Manfredi was not dismayed to find two peasant scoundrels covered with blood breaking into the sacred domain of Saint Francis . In fact , he knew Pisciotta well . He had used the young man in a few smuggling and black market operations . They had in common a sly cunning that delighted them both  --  one surprised to find it in a man so old and holy , the other to find it in one so young and unworldly . The Abbot reassured the gatekeeper monk , then said to Pisciotta , " Well , my dear Aspanu , what mischief are you into now ? " Pisciotta was tightening the shirt around Guiliano 's wound . The Abbot was surprised to see that his face was griefstricken ; he did not think the lad was capable of such emotion . Pisciotta , seeing again that huge wound , was sure his friend was going to die . And how could he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He dreaded Maria Lombardo 's grief . But for now , a more important scene would have to be played . He must convince the Abbot to give Guiliano sanctuary in the monastery . He looked the Abbot straight in the eye . He wanted to convey a message that would not be a direct threat but would make the priest understand that if he refused he would make a mortal enemy . " This is my cousin and dearest friend , Salvatore Guiliano , " Pisciotta said . " As you can see , he has been unfortunate , and in a short time the National Police will be all over the mountainslooking for him . And for me . You are our only hope . I beg you to hide us , and send for a doctor . Do this for me and you have a friend forever . " He emphasized the word " friend . " None of this escaped the Abbot . He understood perfectly . He had heard of this young Guiliano , a brave boy well respected in Montelepre , a great shooter and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Friends had their eyes on him as a possible recruit . The great Don Croce himself , on a social and business visit to the monastery , had mentioned his name to the Abbot as someone it might be profitable to cultivate . But studying the unconscious Guiliano , he was almost sure that this man would need a grave rather than sanctuary , a priest to administer the last rites rather than a doctor . There was very little risk in granting Pisciotta 's request , giving sanctuary to a corpse was not a crime even in Sicily . But he did not want to let this young man know that the favor he was about to do had such little value . He said , " And why are they searching for you ? " Pisciotta hesitated . If the Abbott knew that a policeman was dead he might refuse them sanctuary . But if he were unprepared for the search that was sure to come , he might be surprised into betraying them . He decided to tell the truth . He did so very quickly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soul lost to hell and to study closely Guiliano 's unconscious form . Blood was leaking through the shirt tied around his body . Perhaps the poor lad would die as they talked , and solve the whole problem . As a Franciscan monk , the Abbot was filled with Christian charity , but in these terrible times he had to consider the practicaland material consequences of his merciful deeds . If he gave sanctuary and the boy died , he could only come out with a profit . The authorities would be satisfied with the corpse , the family would be forever in his debt . If Guiliano recovered , his gratitude might be even more valuable . A man who could , while grievously wounded , still fire his pistol and kill a policeman was a man worth having in your debt . He could of course deliver both of these rascals to the NationalPolice , who would then make short work of them . But what would be the profit ? The authorities could do no more for him than they were doing now . The area in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was on the other side of the fence he needed friends . Betraying these youngsters would only earn him enemies among the peasants and the undying hatred of$4THE SICILIANtwo families . The Abbot was not so foolish as to think his cassockcould protect him from the vendetta that would surely follow , and also he had read Pisciotta 's mind ; this was a young fellow who would go far before he trod the road to hell . No , the hatred of the peasant Sicilian could never betaken lightly . True ( ' hristians , they would never shame a statue of the Virgin Mary , but in the hot blood of vendetta they would shotgun the Pope himself for breaking omerta , the ancient code of silence to any authority . In this land with its countless statues of Jesus , there was no belief in the doctrine of turning the other cheek . In this benighted land " forgiveness " was the refuge of the coward . The Sicilian peasant did not know the meaning of mercy . Of one thing he was sure . Pisciotta would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deals , the Abbot had arranged for Pisciotta to be arrested and interrogated . The interrogator , a member of the Palermo Security Police , not one of the carabinieriblockheads , had been subtle and then blunt . But neither cunning nor cruelty had moved Pisciotta . He had remained silent . The interrogator released him and assured the Abbot that this was a lad who could be trusted with more important errands . Since then the Abbot had always held a special place in his heart for Aspanu Pisciotta and often said a prayer for his s ) ul . The Abbot put two fingers in his bony shrunken mouth and whistled . Monks came running and the Abbot instructed them to carry Guiliano into a far wing of the monastery , the Abbot 's own special quarters where he had hidden deserters , sons of rich farmers , from the Italian Army during the war . Then he sent one of his monks for the doctor in the village of San Giuseppe Jato , only five miles away . Pisciotta sat on the bed and held his friend 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Turi Guiliano 's eyes were open , but there was a glaze over them . Pisciotta , almost in tears , did not dare to speak . He wiped Guiliano 's forehead , which was running with perspiration . There was a blue tinge to the skin . It was an hour before the doctor arrived and , having observed85a horde of carabinieri scouring the mountainside , was not surprised that his friend , the Abbot , was concealing a wounded man . This did not concern him ; who cared about the police and government ? The Abbot was a fellow Sicilian who needed help . And who always sent him a basket of eggs on Sunday , a barrel of wine for Christmas and a young lamb for Holy Easter . The doctor examined Guiliano and dressed the wound . The bullet had gone through the belly and probably torn up some vital organs , certainly hit the liver . A great deal of blood had been lost , the young lad had a ghostly pallor , the skin all over his body was bluish white . Around the mouth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as one of the first signals of death . He sighed and said to the Abbot , " I 've done all I can . The bleeding has stopped , but he 's already lost more than a third of his blood , and that 's usually fatal . Keep him warm , feed him a little milk and I 'll leave you some morphine . " He looked down at Guiliano 's powerful body with regret . Pisciotta whispered , " What can I tell his father and mother ? Is there a chance for him ? " The doctor sighed . " Tell them what you like . But the wound is mortal . He 's a strong-looking lad so he may live a few days more , but it 's wise not to hope . " He saw the look of despair in Pisciotta 's eyes and the fleeting look of relief on the Abbot 's face and said with ironic humor , " Of course in this holy place there could always be a miracle . " The Abbot and the doctor went out . Pisciotta leaned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and was astonished that in Guiliano 's eyes was a hint of mockery . The eyes were dark brown but edged with a circle of silver . Pisciotta leaned closer . Turi Guiliano was whispering ; it was a struggle for him to speak . " Tell my mother I will come home , " Turi said . And then he did something Pisciotta would never forget in the years to follow . His hands came up suddenly and grabbed Pisciotta by the86hair of his head . The hands were powerful ; they could never be the hands of a dying man . They yanked Pisciotta 's head down close . " Obey me , " Guiliano said . THE MORNING after Guiliano 's parents called him , Hector Adonis arrived in Montelepre . He rarely used his house in Montelepre . He hated the place of his birth in his young manhood . He especially avoided the Festa . The decorations always distressedhim , their brightness seemed to him some evil disguise for the poverty of the town . And he had always endured humiliationsduring the Festa  --  drunken men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contemptuous smiles . It did not help that he knew so much more than they did . They were so proud , for instance , that every family painted its house the same color their fathers had . They did n't know that the color of the houses gave away their origins , the blood they had inheritedfrom their ancestors along with their houses . That centuries ago the Normans had painted their houses white , the Greeks always used blue , the Arabs various pinks and red . And the Jews used yellow . Now they all considered themselves Italian and Sicilian . The blood had become so intermingled in a thousand years that you could not identify the owner of a house by his features , and if you told the owner of a yellow house that he had Jewish ancestors you could get a knife in your belly . Aspanu Pisciotta lived in a white house though he looked more like an Arab . The Guilianos ' was predominantly Grecian blue , and Turi Guiliano 's face was truly Greek , though he had the body of the lusty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together into something strange and dangerous to make the true Sicilian , and that was what had brought Adonis to Montelepre today. ' fhe Via Bella was straddled at each corner by a pair of carabinieri , grim faced , holding rifles and machine pistols at the ready . The second day of the Festa was beginning but this part87M A R I O P U Z Oof town was curiously deserted and there were no children on the street . Hector Adonis parked his car in front of the Guiliano house , up on the strip of sidewalk . A pair of carabinieri watched him suspiciously until he got out of the car , then smiled with amusement at his short stature . It was Pisciotta who opened the door and led him inside . Guiliano 's mother and father were in the kitchen waiting , a breakfast of cold sausage , bread and coffee on the table . Maria Lombardo was calm , reassured by her beloved Aspanu that her son would recover . She was more angry than fearful . Guiliano 's father looked more proud than sad . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alive and his enemy was dead . Again Pisciotta told his story , this time with comforting humor . He made light of Guiliano 's wound and very little of his own heroism in carrying Guiliano down to the monastery . But Hector Adonis knew that helping an injured man over three miles of rough terrain must have been grueling for the slightly built Pisciotta . Also , he thought Pisciotta skipped over the description of the wound too glibly . Adonis feared the worst . " How did the carabinieri know enough to come here ? " he asked . Pisciotta told him about Guiliano giving up his identity card . Guiliano 's mother broke out in lamentation . " Why did n't Turi let them have the cheese ? Why did he fight ? " Guiliano 's father said harshly to his wife , " What would you have him do ? Inform on that poor farmer ? He would have disgracedthe family name forever . " Hector Adonis was struck by the contradiction in these remarks . He knew the mother was much stronger and more fiery than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resignation , the father the words of defiance . And Pisciotta , this boy Aspanu  --  who would have thought he would be so brave , to rescue his comrade and bring him to safety ? And now lying so coolly to the parents about the hurt their son had suffered . Guiliano 's father said , " If only he had not given up his iden-88THE S I C I L I A Ntity card . Our friends would have sworn he was in the streets here . " Guiliano 's mother said , " They would have arrested him anyway . " She began to weep . " Now he will have to live in the mountains . " Hector Adonis said , " We must make certain the Abbot does not deliver him to the police . " Pisciotta said impatiently , " He will not dare . He knows I 'll hang him in his cassock . " Adonis gave Pisciotta a long look . There was a deadly menace in this young boy . It was not intelligent to damage the ego of a young man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can , with some impunity , insult an older man who has alreadybeen humiliated by life itself and will not take to heart the small slights of another human being . But a young man thinks these offenses mortal . They were looking for help to Hector Adonis , who had helped their son in the past . Hector said , " If the police learn his whereabouts , the Abbot will have no choice . He is not above suspicion himself in certain matters . I think it best , with your permission , to ask my friend , Don Croce Malo , to intercede with the Abbot . " They were surprised that he knew the great Don , except for Pisciotta , who gave him a knowing smile . Adonis said to him sharply , " And what are you doing here ? You 'll be recognized and arrested . They have your description . " Pisciotta said contemptuously , " The two guards were scared shitless . They would n't recognize their mothers . And I have a dozen witnesses who will swear I was in Montelepre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manner . He said to the parents , " You must not attempt to visit your son or tell anyone , even your dearest friends , where he is . The police have informers and spies everywhere . Aspanu will visit ' Puri at night . As soon as he can move I 'll make arrangements89MARIO PUZO i THE SICILIANfor him to live in another town until this all quiets down . Then , with some money , things can be arranged , and Turi can come home . Do n't worry about him , Maria , guard your health . And you , Aspanu , keep me informed . " He embraced the mother and father . Maria Lombardo was still weeping when he left . He had many things to do  --  most importantly to get word to Don Croce and make sure that Turi 's sanctuary remained safe . Thank God the government in Rome did not offer rewards for information on the murder of a policeman , or the Abbot would have sold Turi as quickly as he sold one of his holy relics . TURI GUILIANO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the doctor pronounce his wound mortal , but he could not believe he was dying . His body seemed suspended in air , free of pain and fear . He could never die . He did not know that great loss of blood produces euphoria . During the days , one of the monks tended him , fed him milk . Evenings , the Abbot came with the doctor . Pisciotta visited him in the night and held his hand and nursed him through the long evil hours of darkness . At the end of two weeks , the doctor proclaimed a miracle . Turi Guiliano had willed his body to heal , to materialize the lost blood , to meld together the vital organs that had been torn by the steel jacketed bullet . And in the euphoria inspired by the draining of the blood from his body he dreamed of future glory . He felt a new freedom , that he could no longer be held accountablefor anything he did from this time on . That the laws of society , the stricter Sicilian laws of family , could no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any act ; that his bloody wound made him innocent . And all this because a foolish carabiniere had shot him over a piece of cheese . For the weeks of his convalescence , he played over and over in his mind the days he and his fellow villagers had congregated in the town square waiting for the gabellotti , the overseers of the large land estates , to pick them out for a day 's work , offering starvation wages with the contemptuous take-it-or-leave-it sneer of men who had all the power . The unfair sharing of crops that left everyone impoverished after a year 's hard work . The overhearinghand of the law which punished the poor and let the rich go free . If he recovered from his wound , he swore he would see justice done . He would never again be a powerless boy at the mercy of fate . He would arm himself , physically and mentally . Of one thing he was sure : He would never again stand helpless before the world , as he had before Guido Quintana , and the policeman who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been Turi Guiliano no longer existed . AT THE end of a month , the doctor advised another four weeks of rest with some exercise , and so Guiliano donned a monk 's habit and strolled around the grounds of the monastery . The Abbot had become fond of the young man , and often accompaniedhim , telling stories about his youthful travels to far-off lands . The Abbot 's affection was not lessened when Hector Adonis sent him a sum of money for his prayers for the poor and Don Croce himself advised the Abbot that he had an interest in the young man . As for Guiliano , he was astonished at how these monks lived . In a countryside where people were almost starving , where laborershad to sell their sweat for fifty cents a day , the monks of Saint Francis lived like kings . The monastery was really a huge and rich estate . They had a lemon orchard , a scattering of stout olive trees as old as Christ . They had a small bamboo plantation and a butcher shop into which they fed their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and turkeys roamed at will , crowds of them . The monks ate meat every day with their spaghetti , drank homemade90 I 9 1M A R I O P U Z O THE S I C I L I A Nwine from their own huge cellar , and traded on the black market for tobacco , which they smoked like fiends . But they worked hard . During the day they labored barefoot in cassocks tucked up to their knees , sweat pouring down their brows . On their tonsured heads , to protect them from the sun , they wore oddly shaped American fedoras , black and brown , which the Abbot had acquired from some military government supply officer for a cask of wine . The monks wore the fedoras in many different styles , some with the brims snapped down , gangster style , others with the brims flapped upward all around to form gutters in which they kept their cigarettes . The Abbot had come to hate these hats and had forbidden their use except when actually working in the fields . For the second four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Abbot 's astonishment he worked hard in the fields and helped the older monks carry the heavy baskets of fruit and olives back to the storage shed . As he grew well , Guiliano enjoyedthe work , enjoyed showing off his strength . They piled his baskets high and he never let his knees buckle . The Abbot was proud of him and told him he could stay as long as he liked , that he had the makings of a true man of God . Turi Guiliano was happy that four weeks . He had after all returned from the dead in body and in his head he was weaving daydreams and miracles . And he enjoyed the old Abbot , who treated him with absolute trust and revealed the secrets of the monastery to him . The old man boasted that all the products of the monastery were sold directly on the black market , not turned over to the government warehouses . Except for the wine , which was swilled down by the monks themselves . At night there was a great deal of gambling and drunkenness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this the Abbot closed his eyes . " These are hard times , " he said to Guiliano . " The promisedreward of heaven is too far away , men must have some pleasure now . God will forgive them . " One rainy afternoon , the Abbot showed Turi another wing ofthe monastery which was used as a warehouse . This was overflowingwith holy relics manufactured by a skilled team of old monks . The Abbot , like any shopkeeper , bewailed hard times . " Before the war , we had a very good business , " he sighed . " This warehouse was never more than half full . And just look what sacred treasures we have here . A bone from the fish multipliedby Christ . The staff carried by Moses on his way to the Promised Land . " He paused to watch Guiliano 's astonished face with amused satisfaction . Then his bony face contorted into a wicked grin . Kicking a huge pile of wooden sticks , he said almost gleefully , " This used to be our best item . Hundreds of pieces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And in this bin are fragments of any saint you can name . There is n't a household in Sicily that does n't have the bone of a saint . And locked away in a special storeroom we have thirteen arms of Saint Andrew , three heads of John the Baptist and seven suits of armor worn by Joan of Arc . In the winter , our monks travel far and wide to sell these treasures . " Turi Guiliano was laughing now and the Abbot smiled at him . But Guiliano was thinking how the poor were always deceived , even by those who pointed the road to salvation . It was another important fact to remember . The Abbot showed him a huge tub full of medallions blessed by the Cardinal of Palermo , thirty shrouds that Jesus wore when he died , and two black Virgin Marys . That stopped Turi Guiliano'slaughter . He told the Abbot about the black Virgin statue owned by his mother and so treasured by her since she was a little girl ; that it had been in her family for generations . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him kindly on the shoulder and told him the monastery had been making replicas for over a hundred years carved from good olive wood . But he assured Guiliano that even the replicas had value , since only a few were made . The Abbot saw no harm confiding in a murderer such venial sins of holy men . Still Guiliano 's disapproving silence disturbed92 93M A R I O P U Z Othe Abbot . Defensively , he said , " Remember that we men who devote our lives to God must also live in the material world of men who do not believe in waiting for their rewards in heaven . We too have families and must aid and protect them . Many of our monks are poor and come from the poor , who we know are the salt of the earth . We can not permit our sisters and brothers , our nephews and cousins to starve in these hard times . The Holy Church itself needs our help , must defend itself against powerful enemies . The Communists and Socialists , those misguided liberals , must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a comfort to Mother Church are the faithful ! Their need for our holy relics supplies the money to crush the infidels and fills a need in their own souls . If we did not supply them they would waste their money on gambling and wine and shameful women . Do n't you agree ? " Guiliano nodded , but he was smiling . It was dazzling for one so young to meet such a master of hypocrisy . The Abbot was irritated by that smile ; he had expected a more gracious responsefrom a murderer to whom he had given sanctuary and nursed back from the gate of death . Grateful respect dictated a properly hypocritical response of the utmost sincerity . This smuggler , this murderer , this peasant , Master Turi Guiliano , should show himself more understanding , more a Christian . The Abbot said sternly , " Remember our true faith rests on our belief in miracles . " " Yes , " Guiliano said . " And I know with all my heart that it is your duty to help us find them . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fun , with a sincere good will to please his benefactor . But it was all he could do to keep from laughing outright . The Abbot was pleased and all his affection returned . This was a fine fellow , he had enjoyed his company the past few months , and it was comforting to know that the man was deeply in his debt . And he would not be ungrateful ; he had already shown a noble heart . He expressed in word and deed , every day , his respect and gratitude to the Abbot . He did not have the94THE S I C I L I A Nhard heart of an outlaw . What would happen to such a man in this present-day Sicily , full of informers , poverty , bandits , and sundry sinners ? Ah , well , the Abbot thought , a man who has murdered once can do it again , in a pinch . The Abbot decided that Don Croce should counsel Turi Guiliano on the right path to life . One day , while resting on his bed , Turi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Father Benjamino Malo , a very dear friend , then left them alone together . Father Benjamino said solicitously , " My dear young man , 1 hope you have recovered from your wound . The Holy Abbot tells me it was truly a miracle . " Guiliano said politely , " God 's mercy . " And Father Benjaminobowed his head as if he himself had received that benediction . Guiliano studied him . This was a priest who had never labored in the fields . His cassock was too clean at the hem , his face too puffily white , his hands too soft . But the countenance was holy enough ; it was meek and had a Christlike resignation , a Christianhumility . The voice too was soft and gentle when Father Benjamino said , " My son , I will hear your confession and give you Holy Communion . Shriven of sin , you can go out into the world with a pure heart . " Turi Guiliano studied this priest who wielded such sublime power . " Forgive me , Father , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contrition and it would be false of me to make a confession at this time . But thank you for your blessing . " The priest nodded and said , " Yes , that would compound your sins . But I have another offer that is perhaps more practical in this world . My brother , Don Croce , has sent me to ask if you would like to take refuge with him in Villaba . You would be paid a good wage , and of course , as you must know , the authorities would never dare molest you while you are under his protec-tion. " 95M A R I O P U Z O THE S I C I L I A NGuiliano was astonished that word of his deed had reached such a man as Don Croce . He knew he had to be careful . He detested the Mafia , and did not wish to be caught in their web . " This is a very great honor , " he said . " I thank you and your brother . But I must consult with my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So for now permit me to refuse your kind offer . " He saw the priest was surprised . Who in Sicily would refuse the protection of the great Don ? So he added , " Perhaps in a few weeks , I will think differently and come to see you in Villaba . " Father Benjamino had recovered . He raised his hands in benediction . " Go with God , my son , " he said . " You will always be welcome in my brother 's house . " He made the sign of the cross and left . TURI GUILIANO knew it was time to leave . When Aspanu Pisciottacame to visit that evening Guiliano instructed him on what preparations to make for his return to the outside world . He saw that as he had changed , so had his friend . Pisciotta did not flinch or make any protest at receiving orders that he knew would profoundly alter his life . Finally Guiliano told him , " Aspanu , you can come with me or you can remain with your family . Do what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Do you think I 'm going to let you have all the fun and glory ? Let you play in the mountains while I bring donkeys out to work and pick olives ? And what about our friendship ? Am I to let you live in the mountains alone when we have played and worked together since we were children ? Only when you return to Montelepre in freedom will I return there too . So no more foolish talk . I 'll come to get you in four days . It will take a little time to do all you want me to do . " PISCIOTTA WAS busy those four days . He had already tracked down the smuggler on horseback who had offered to go after thewounded Guiliano . His name was Marcuzzi , and he was a feared man and a large-scale smuggler operating under the protection of Don Croce and Guido Quintana . He had an uncle of the same name who was a great Mafia chief . Pisciotta discovered that Marcuzzi made regular trips from Montelepre to Castellammare . Pisciotta knew the farmer who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the animals taken out of the fields and brought to a barn near the town , he gambled that Marcuzzi was making a trip the next day . At dawn Pisciotta stationed himself along the road that he knew Marcuzzi had to take , and waited for him . He had a lupara , which many Sicilian families owned as part of their household equipment . Indeed , the deadly Sicilian shotgun was so common and so often used for assassination that when Mussolini cleaned out the Mafia , he had ordered all stone walls to be knocked down to at most three feet in height so that murderers could not use the walls as ambushpoints . He had decided to kill Marcuzzi not only because the smugglerhad offered to help the police kill the wounded Guiliano , but because he had also boasted of it to his friends . By killing the smuggler he would give warning to any others who might betray Guiliano . Also he needed the weapons he knew Marcuzzi carried . He did not have to wait long . Because Marcuzzi was leading empty mules to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ careless . He rode his lead mule down a mountain trail with his rifle slung over his shoulder , instead of at the ready . When he saw Pisciotta standing in the trail in front of him , he was not alarmed . All he saw was a short slender boy with a thin dandyish mustache who was smiling in a way that irritated him . It was only when Pisciotta swung the lupara out from beneath his jacket that Marcuzzi paid full attention . He said gruffly , " You 've got me going the wrong way . I have n't picked up my goods yet . And these mules are under the protection of the Friends of the Friends . Be clever and find yourself another customer . " 9 6 97M A R I O P U Z O Pisciotta said softly , " I only want your life . " He smiled cruelly . " There was a day you wanted to be a hero for the police . Just a few months ago , do you remember ? " Marcuzzi remembered . He turned the mule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand from Pisciotta 's gaze . He slid his hand into his belt and drew his pistol . At the same time he yanked on the mule 's bridle to bring himself around in a shooting position . The last thing he saw was Pisciotta 's smile as the lupara blasted his body out of the saddle and flung it into the dust . With grim satisfaction Pisciotta stood over the body and fired another blast into the head , then took the pistol still in Marcuz- zi 's hand and the rifle wrapped on the body by its sling . He emptied the man 's jacket pocket of rifle bullets and put them into his own . Then quickly and methodically he shot each of the four mules , a warning to anyone who might help the enemies of Guiliano , even indirectly . He stood on the road , his lupara in his arms , the dead man 's rifle slung over his shoulder , the pistol in his waistband . He felt no sense of pity and his ferocity pleased him . For despite his love for his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ways . And though he acknowledged Turi as his chief , he always felt he had to prove his claim to their friendship by being as courageous and as clever . Now he too had stepped out of the magic circle of boyhood , of society , and joined Turi on the outside of that circle . With this act he had hound himself forever to Turi Guiliano . Two DAYS later , just before the evening meal , Guiliano left the monastery . He embraced all of the monks as they gathered in the eating hall and thanked them for their kindnesses . The monks were sorry to see him go . True , he had never attended their religious rites , and had not made a confession and act of contrition for the murder he had committed , but some of these monks had started their manhood with similar crimes and were not judgmental . The Abbot escorted Guiliano to the gate of the monastery where Pisciotta was waiting . He presented him with a goingawaygift . It was a statue of the black Virgin Mary , a duplicate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother . Pisciottahad an American green duffel bag and Guiliano put the black Virgin statuette into it . Pisciotta watched with a sardonic eye as the Abbot and Guilianosaid their goodbyes . He knew the Abbot to be a smuggler , a secret member of the Friends of the Friends , and a slavedrivingtaskmaster with his poor monks . So he could not understand the sentimentality of the Abbot 's farewell . It did not occur to Pisciotta that the love and affection and respect that Guiliano inspired in him he could also inspire in as powerful and as old a man as the Abbot . Though the Abbot 's affection was genuine , it was tinged with self-interest . He knew this boy might one day become a force to reckon with in Sicily . It was like spotting the trace of godliness . As for Turi Guiliano , he was genuinely grateful . The Abbot had saved his life , but more than that , had instructed him in many things and had been a delightful companion . The Abbot had even let him have the use of his library @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chicanery ; it seemed to him a nice balance to strike in life , the doing of good without doing great visible harm , the balancing of power to make life go smoothly . The Abbot and Turi Guiliano embraced each other . Turi said , " I am in your debt . Remember me when you need help of any kind . Whatever you ask , I must do . " The Abbot patted his shoulder . " Christian charity does not require repayment , " he said . " Return to the ways of God , my son , and pay his tribute . " But he was speaking by rote . He knew well this kind of innocence in the young . Out of it a devil could rise in flames to do his bidding . He would remember Guiliano 's promise . Guiliano shouldered the duffel bag despite Pisciotta 's protest , and they walked through the monastery gate together . They never looked hack . THE S I C I L I A NCHAPTER6FROM A jutting cliff edge near the top of Monte d'Ora , Guilianoand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Only a few miles below them , the house lights were coming on to fight the falling darkness . Guiliano even imagined he could hear the music coming from the loudspeakers in the square , which always played Rome radio station broadcasts to serenade the town 's strollers before their evening meal . But the mountain air was deceiving . It would take two hours to make his way down to the town and four hours to get back up . Guiliano and Pisciotta had played here as children ; they knew every rock on this mountain and every cave and every tunnel . Further back on this cliff was the Grotta Bianca , the favorite cave of their childhood , bigger than any house in Montelepre . Aspanu had followed his orders well , Turi Guiliano thought . The cave was stocked with sleeping bags , cooking pans , boxes of ammunition and sacks of food and bread . There was a wooden box holding flashlights , lanterns and knives , and there were also some cans of kerosene . He laughed . " Aspanu , we can live up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Aspanu said . " This is the first place the carabinieri came when they went looking for you . " " The cowards only look in daylight , " Turi answered . " We are safe at night . " IooA great cloak of darkness had fallen over the mountains , but the sky was so full of stars that they could see each other clearly . Pisciotta opened the duffel bag and started pulling out weapons and clothes . Slowly and ceremonially , Turi Guiliano armed himself . Taking off his monk 's cassock , he donned the moleskin trousers , then the huge sheepskin jacket with its many pockets . He put two pistols in his waistband and strapped the machine pistol inside the jacket so it could be covered and yet swung into action immediately . He buckled an ammunition belt around his waist and put extra boxes of bullets in the jacket pockets . Pisciottahanded him a knife , which he put in the army boots he had drawn on . Then another small pistol , which fit into a string holster tied into the inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ checked all the guns and ammunition carefully . The rifle he carried openly , its sling over his shoulder . Finally he was ready . He smiled at Pisciotta , who carried only a lupara out in the open and his knife in a holster at his back . Pisciotta said , " I feel naked . Can you walk with all that iron on your body ? If you fall down I 'll never be able to lift you up . " Guiliano was still smiling , the secret smile of a child who helieves he has the world at bay . The huge scar on his body ached with the weight of the weapons and ammunition , but he welcomed that ache . It gave him absolution . " I 'm ready to see my family or meet my enemies , " he said to Pisciotta . The two voting men started down the long winding path from the top of Monte d'Ora to the town of Montelepre below . They walked below a vault of stars . Armed against death and his fellow man , drinking in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Guiliano felt a serenity he had never known . He was no longer helpless against some random foe . He no longer had to entertain the enemy within himself that doubted his courage . if he had willed himself not to die , had willed his torn body to knit together , he now believed that he could make his body do this over and over again . He no longer doubted that he had some magnificent destiny before him . He shared the magic of those medieval heroes who could not die until they1 otM A R I O P U Z Ocame to the end of their long story , until they had achieved their great victories . He would never leave these mountains , these olive trees , this Sicily . He had only a vague idea of what his future glory would be , but he never doubted that glory . He would never again be a poor peasant youth going in fear of the carabinieri , the judges , the pulverizing corruption of law . They were coming down out of the mountains now and onto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ padlocked roadside shrine of the Virgin Mary and child , the blue plaster robes shining like the sea in moonlight . The smell of the orchardsfilled the air with a sweetness that made Guiliano almost dizzy . He saw Pisciotta stoop and pick a prickly pear made sweet by the night air , and he felt a love for this friend who had saved his life , a love with its root in their childhood spent together . He wanted to share his immortality with him . It was never their fate to die two nameless peasants on a mountainside in Sicily . In a great exuberance of spirit Guiliano called out , " Aspanu , Aspanu , I believe , I believe , " and started running down the final slope of the mountain , out of the ghostly white rocks , past the holy shrines of Christ and martyred saints standing in padlocked boxes . Pisciotta ran beside him , laughing , and they raced together into the arc of moonlight that showered the road to Montelepre . THE MOUNTAINS ended in a hundred yards of green pasture that led @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Via Bella . Behind these walls , each house had its garden of tomatoes , and some , a lonely olive or lemon tree . The gate to the Guiliano garden fence was unlocked , and the two young men slipped through quietly and found Guiliano 's mother waiting for them . She rushed into Turi Guiliano 's arms , the tears streaming down her face . She kissed him fiercely and whispered , " My beloved son , my beloved son , " and Turi Guiliano found himself standingTHE S I C I L I A Nin the moonlight not responding to her love for the first time in his life . It was now nearly midnight , the moon still bright , and they hurried into the house to escape observation by spies . The windows were shuttered , and relatives of the Guiliano and Pisciotta families had been posted along all the streets to warn of police patrols . In the house Guiliano 's friends and family waited to celebrate his homecoming . A feast worthy of Holy Easter had been laid out . They had this one night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Guiliano 's father embraced him and slapped him on the back to show his approval . His two sisters were there , and Hector Adonis . Also there was a neighbor , a woman called La Venera . She was a widow of about thirty-five . Her husband had been a famous bandit named Candeleria , who had been betrayed , then ambushed by the police , only a year ago . She had become a close friend of Guiliano 's mother , but Turi was surprised that she was present at this reunion . Only his mother could have invited her . For a moment he wondered why . They ate and drank and treated Turi Guiliano as if he had returned from a long holiday in foreign countries . But then his father wanted to see his wound . Guiliano lifted his shirt out of his trousers and revealed the great flaming scar , the tissue around it still blue-black from the trauma of the gunshot . His mother broke into lamentations . Guiliano said to her with a smile , " Would you rather have seen me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Though the familiar scene duplicated the happiest days of his childhood , he felt a great distance from them all . There were all his favorite dishes , the inky squid , the fat macaroni with its herbed sauce of tomato , the roasted lamb , the great bowl of olives , green and red salad doused with the pure first pressing of olive oil , bamboo-covered bottles of Sicilian wine . Everything from the earth of Sicily . His mother and father told their fairy tales about life in America . And Hector Adonis regaled them on102 103M A R I O P U Z Othe glories of the history of Sicily . Of Garibaldi and his famous Redshirts . Of the day of the Sicilian Vespers , when the people of Sicily had risen to slaughter the French occupying army so many hundreds of years ago . All the tales of Sicily oppressed starting with Rome , followed by the Moors and Normans and the French and the Germans and the Spanish . Woe was Sicily ! Never free , its people always hungry , their labor sold so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now there was not a Sicilian who believed in government , in law , in the structured order of society which had always been used to turn them into beasts of burden . Guiliano had listened to these stories through the years , imprinting them on his brain . But only now did Guiliano realize that he could change this . He watched Aspanu smoking a cigarette over his coffee . Even at this joyful reunion , Aspanu had an ironic smile on his lips . Guiliano could tell what he was thinking and what he would say later : All you have to do is to be stupid enough to get shot by a policeman , commit murder , become an outlaw , and then your loved ones will show their affection and treat you like a saint t . om heaven . And yet Aspanu was the only one he did not feel cut ott from . And their there was the woman , La Venera . Why had his mother in iced her , and why did she come ? He saw that her face ' A as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lips so dark and red that they seemed almost purple in this smoky curtained light . There was no way to tell what her figure was like , for she wore the Sicilian widow 's shapeless black dress . Turi Guiliano had to tell them the whole story of the shooting at the Four Crossroads . His father , a little drunk with wine , emitted growls of approval at the death of the policeman . His mother was silent . His father told the story of how the farmer had come looking for his donkey and his own remark to the farmer : " Stay content you have lost a donkey . I have lost a son . " Aspanu said , " A donkey looking for a donkey . " They all laughed . Guiliano 's father went on : " When the farmer heard that a policeman was killed he was too afraid to make his claim , that he might be bastinadoed . " Turi said , " He will be repaid . " Finally Hector Adonis outlined his plans to save Turi . The family of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's parents would have to mortgage their little piece of land to raise the money . Adonis himself would contribute a sum . But this tactic would have to wait until feelings of anger had died down . The influence of the great Don Croce would be brought to bear on government officials and the family of the slain man . After all , it had been more or less an accident . There had been no real ill will on either side . A farce could be played out as long as the victim 's family and key government officials cooperated . The only drawback was the identity card at the scene of the killing . But in a year 's time Don Croce could cause that to vanish from the prosecutor 's files . Most important , Turi Guiliano must remainout of trouble for that year . He must disappear into the mountains . Turi Guiliano listened to them all patiently , smiling , nodding his head , not showing his irritation . They still thought of him as he had been at Festa time over two months ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself of arms ; his guns lay at his feet beneath the table . But that had not impressed them , nor the ugly huge scar . They could not imagine how his mind had been torn apart by that great blow to his body , or that he would never again be the young man they had known . In this house , he was for this moment safe . Trusted people patrolled the streets and watched the carabinieri barracks to give him warning of any attack . The house itself , built many hundreds of years ago , was made of stone ; its windows had heavy wooden shutters locked and a foot thick . The wooden door was strong and iron barred . Not a chink of light could escape this house , no enemy could force his way in quickly in a surprise attack . And yet Turi Guiliano felt himself in danger. lo5M A R I O P U Z OThese loved ones would trap him into his former life , persuade him to become a peasant farmer , to lay down his arms against his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At that moment he knew that he would have to be cruel to those he loved most . It had always been the young man 's dream to acquirelove rather than power . But that was all changed . He now saw clearly that power came first . He spoke gently to Hector Adonis and to the others . " Dear godfather , I know you speak out of affection and concern . But I ca n't let my mother and father lose their little bit of land to help me out of my trouble . And all of you here , do n't worry so much about me . I 'm a grown man who must pay for his carelessness . And I wo n't have anyone paying an indemnity for that carabinieriI shot . Remember , he tried to kill me just because I was smuggling a bit of cheese . I would never have fired at him except that I thought I was dying and wanted to even the score . But all that 's past . I wo n't be so easy to shoot the next time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's more fun in the mountains anyway . " But Guiliano 's mother was not to be distracted . They could all see her panic , the fear in her burning eyes . She said desperately . " Do n't become a bandit , do n't rob poor people who have enough misery in their lives . Do n't become an outlaw . Let La Venera tell you what kind of life her husband lived . " I.a Venera raised her head and looked directly at Guiliano . Ile was struck by the sensuality in her face , as if she were trying to attract his passion toward her . Her eyes were bold and stared at him almost in invitation . Before he had thought of her only as an older woman ; now he felt her sexually . When she spoke her voice was husky with emotion . She said , " In those same mountains you wish to go to my husband had to live like an animal . Always in fear . Always . He could not eat . He could not sleep . When we were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We slept with guns on the floor beside the bed . But that did n't help him . When our daughterTHE S I C I L I A Nwas ill , he tried to visit her , and they were waiting for him . They knew he was softhearted . He was shot down like a dog in the streets . They stood over him and laughed in my face . " Guiliano could see the grin on Pisciotta 's face . The great bandit , Candeleria , softhearted ? He had massacred six men as suspectedinformers , preyed on wealthy farmers , extorted money from poor peasants , struck terror into a whole countryside . But his wife saw him differently . La Venera did not notice Pisciotta 's smile . She went on : " I buried him and then buried my child a week later . They said it was pneumonia . But I know her heart was broken . What I remembermost was when I visited him in the mountains . He was always cold and hungry , and sometimes ill . He would have given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But worst of all , his heart became as hard as an olive pit . He was no longer human , may he rest in peace . So , dear Turi , do n't be so proud . We will help you in your misfortune , do n't become what my husband was before he died . " Everyone was silent . Pisciotta was no longer smiling . Guiliano'sfather murmured that he would be glad to be rid of the farm ; he could sleep late mornings . Hector Adonis was staring down at the tablecloth , frowning . None of them spoke . The silence was broken by a quick tapping on the door , a signal from one of the watchers . Pisciotta went to speak to the man . When he came back he made a signal for Guiliano to arm himself . " The carabinieri barracks are blazing with light , " he said . " And there is a police van blocking the end of the Via Bella where it enters the town square . They are getting ready to raid this house . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quick with our goodbyes . " What struck everyone was the calmness with which Turi Guilianoprepared his escape . His mother rushed into his arms and as he embraced her he already had his sheepskin jacket in his hands . He said his goodbyes to the others and in the next instant seemed to be fully armed , his jacket on , his rifle slung . And yetto6 I 07M A R I O P U Z Ohe had not moved quickly or hurriedly . He stood there for a moment smiling at them and then said to Pisciotta , " You can stay and meet me in the mountains later , or you can come with me now . " Wordlessly Pisciotta moved to the back door and opened it . Guiliano gave his mother a final embrace , and she kissed him fiercely and said , " Hide , do n't do anything rash . Let us help you . " But he was already out of her arms . Pisciotta was leading the way , across the fields to the beginningslopes of the mountains . Guiliano whistled sharply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The way was clear to the mountains , and his watchers had told him there were no police patrols in that direction . They would be safe in the Grotta Bianca after a four-hour climb . If the carabinieri chased them through the darkness , it would be an extraordinary act of braveryand foolishness . Guiliano said , " Aspanu , how many men do the carabinieri have in their garrison ? " " Twelve , " Pisciotta said . " And the Maresciallo . " Guiliano laughed . " Thirteen is an unlucky number . And why are we running away from so few ? " He paused for a moment and then said , " Follow me . " He led the way back through the fields so that they entered the town of Montelepre further down the street . Then across the Via Bella so that they could watch the Guiliano house from the safety of a dark narrow alley . They crouched in the shadows waiting . Five minutes later they could hear a jeep rattling down the Via Bella . Six carabinieri were crammed into it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went through the side street to block the back entrance . The Maresciallo and three of his men went up to the door and hammered on it . At the same time a small covered truck pulled up behind the jeep and two more carabinieri , rifles ready , jumped out to command the street . Turi Guiliano watched all this with interest . The police raidloxTHE S I C I L I A Nwas based on the assumption that the targets would never be in a position to launch a counterattack ; that their only alternative would be to run from a superior force . Turi Guiliano at that moment made it a basic principle always to be in a position to counterattack when he was being hunted , no matter how great the odds , or perhaps the greater the odds the better . This was Guiliano 's first tactical operation and he was astonished at how easily he could command the situation if he chose to shed blood . True , he could not shoot at the Maresciallo and the three men at the door since the bullets might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could easily slaughter the two men commanding the street and the two drivers in their vehicles . If he wished , he could do this as soon as the Maresciallo and his men were in the Guiliano house . They would not dare come out , and he and Pisciotta could make their way through the fields at their leisure . As for the police blocking the end of the street with their van , they would be too far out of the way to be a factor . They would not have the initiative to come up the street without receiving orders . But at this point he had no desire to shed blood . It was still an intellectual maneuver . And he particularly wanted to see the Maresciallo in action , since this was the man who would be his principal opponent in the future . At that moment the door of the house was being opened by Guiliano 's father , and the Maresciallo took the old man roughly by the arm and thrust him out into the street with a shouted order to wait there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ranking noncommissioned officer of the National Police force and usuallyis the commander of a small town detachment . As such he is an important member of the local community and treated with the same respect as the local Mayor and priest of the parish . So he was not expecting the greeting from Guiliano 's mother when she barred his way and spit on the ground in front of him to show her contempt . Ile and his three men had to force their way into the house1 oyM A R I O P U Z O and search it while being scathingly abused and cursed by Gui- liano 's mother . Everyone was taken out into the street to be questioned ; the neighboring houses emptied of their women and men who also verbally abused the police . When the search of the house proved fruitless , the Mare- sciallo attempted to question the inhabitants . Guiliano 's father was astonished . " Do you think I would inform on my own son ? " he asked the Maresciallo , and a great roar of approval came from the crowd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back into their house . In the shadow of their alley , Pisciotta said to Guiliano , " Lucky for them your mother does n't have our weapons . " But Turi did n't answer . The blood had rushed to his head . It took an enormous effort to control himself . The Maresciallo lashed out with his club and hit a man in the crowd who dared to protest the rough treatment of Guiliano 's parents . Two other carabinieri began grabbing citizens of Montelepre at random and throwing them into the waiting truck , kicking and clubbing them on their way , ignoring their cries of fear and protest . Suddenly there was one man standing alone on the street fac- ing the carabinieri . Ile lunged at the Maresciallo . A shot rang out , and the man fell to the cobblestones . From one of the houses a woman began to scream and then she ran out and threw her body over her fallen husband . ' Puri Guiliano recognized her ; she was an old friend of ' his family who always brought his mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoulder and whispered , " Follow me , " and started running down the narrow crooked streets to- ward the central square of the town , at the other end of the Via Bella . Pisciotta yelled fiercely , " What the hell are you doing ? " but then fell silent . For he suddenly knew exactly what Turi had in mind . The truck full of prisoners would have to go down the Via Bella to turn around and make its run back to the Bellampo Barracks . As he ran down the dark parallel street , Turi Guiliano felt invisible , godlike . He knew the enemy would never dream , could never even imagine , what he was doing , that they thought he was running for safety in the mountains . He felt a wild elation . They would learn they could not raid his mother 's home with impunity , they would think twice before doing it again . ' They could not again shoot a man in cold blood . He would make them show respect for his neighbors and his family . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the light of its single streetlamp he could see the police van blocking the entrance into the Via Bella . As if he could have been caught in such a trap . What could they have been thinking of ? Was that a sample of official cleverness ? He switched to another side street to bring him to the back entrance of the church that dominated the square , Pisciotta following him . Inside , they both vaulted the altar rail and then both stopped for a fraction of a second on the holy stage where long ago they had performed as altar boys and served their priest while he was giving the people of MontelepreSunday Mass and Communion . Holding their guns at the ready they genuflected and crossed themselves clumsily ; for a moment the power of the wax statues of Christ crowned with thorns , the gilded chalky blue-robed Virgin Marys , the batteries of saints blunted their lust for battle . Then they were running up the short aisle to the great oaken door that gave a field of fire to the square . And there they knelt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Via Bella backed off to let the truck with the arrested men enter the square to make its circle and go back up the street . At that moment Turi Guiliano pushed open the church door and said to Pisciotta , " Fire over their heads . " At the same moment he fired his machine pistol into the blocking van , aiming at the tires and the engine . Suddenly the square flamed with light as the engine blew up and the van caught fire . The two carabinieri in the front seat tumbled out like loosejointedpuppets , their surprise not giving their bodies time to tighten against the shock . Beside him Pisciotta was firing hisMARIO Puzorifle at the cab of the truck holding the prisoners . Turi Guiliano saw the driver leap out and fall still . The other armed carabinieri jumped out and Pisciotta fired again . The second policeman went down . Turi turned to Pisciotta to reproach him but suddenlythe stained glass windows of the church shattered with machine gun fire and the colored bits scattered on the church floor like rubies . Turi realized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That Aspanu was right . They must kill or be killed . Guiliano pulled Pisciotta 's arm and ran back through the church and out the back door and through the dark crooked streets of Montelepre . He knew that tonight there was no hope of helping the prisoners to escape . They slipped through the final wall of the town over the open fields and kept running until they were safely into the rising slopes covered with huge white stones . Dawn was breaking when they reached the top of Monte d'Ora in the Cammarata Mountains . Over a thousand years ago Spartacus had hidden his slave army here and led them out to fight the Roman legions . Standing on the top of this Monte d'Ora watching the sun come radiantly alive , Turi Guiliano was filled with youthful glee that he had escaped his enemies . He would never obey a fellow human being again . He would choose who should live and who should die , and there was no doubt in his mind that all he would do would be for the glory and freedom of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would only strike for the cause of justice , to help the poor . That he would win every battle , that he would win the love of the oppressed . He was twenty years old . I2CHAPTER7DON CROCE MALO was born in the village of Villaba , a little mudhole he was to make prosperous and famous all through Sicily . It was not ironic , to Sicilians , that he sprang from a religious family who groomed him for priesthood in the Holy Catholic Church , that his first name had originally been Crocefisso , a religious name given only by the most pious parents . Indeed , as a slender youth he was forced to play the part of Christ in those religious plays put on in celebration of Holy Easter and was acclaimed for his marvelous air of piety . But when he grew to manhood at the turn of the century , it was clear that Croce Malo had difficulty accepting any authority other than himself . He smuggled , he extorted , he stole , and finally , worst of all , he impregnated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the plays . He then refused to marry her , claiming they had both been carried away with the religious fervor of the play , and therefore he should be forgiven . The girl 's family found this explanation too subtle to accept and demanded matrimony or death . Croce Malo was too proud to marry a girl so dishonored and fled to the mountains . After a year as a bandit , he had the good fortune to make contact with the Mafia . " Mafia , " in Arabic , means a place of sanctuary , and the word took its place in the Sicilian language when the Saracens ruledI13the country in the tenth century . Throughout history , the people of Sicily were oppressed mercilessly by the Romans , the Papacy , the Normans , the French , the Germans , and the Spanish . Their governments enslaved the poor working class , exploiting their labor , raping their women , murdering their leaders . Even the rich did not escape . The Spanish Inquisition of the Holy Catholic Church stripped them of their wealth for being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a secret society of avengers . When the royal courts refused to take action against a Norman noble who raped a farmer 's wife , a band of peasants assassinatedhim . When a police chief tortured some petty thief with the dreaded cassetta , that police chief was killed . Gradually the strongest-willed of the peasants and the poor formed themselves into an organized society which had the support of the people and in effect became a second and more powerful government . When there was a wrong to be redressed , no one ever went to the official police , they went to the leader of the local Mafia , who mediated the problem . The greatest crime a Sicilian could commit was to give any information of any kind to the authorities about anything done by the Mafia . They kept silent . And this silence came to be called omerta . Over the centuries the practice enlarged to never giving the police information about a crime committed even against oneself . All communications broke down between the people and the law enforcement agencies of reigning governmentsso that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stranger the simplest directions to a village or a person 's house . Through the centuries the Mafia governed Sicily , a presence so shadowy and indistinct that the authorities could never quite grasp the extent of its power . Up until World War II , the word " Mafia " was never uttered on the island of Sicily . FIVE YEARS after Don Croce 's flight into the mountains , he was well known as a " Qualified Man . " That is , someone who couldbe entrusted with the elimination of a human being without causingmore than a minimal amount of trouble . He was a " Man of Respect , " and after making certain arrangements , he returned to live in his native town of Villaba , some forty miles south of Palermo . These arrangements included paying an indemnity to the family of the girl he had dishonored . This was later heralded as the measure of his generosity , but it was rather the proof of his wisdom . The pregnant girl had already been shipped to relativesin America with the label of a young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remembered . They were , after all , Sicilian . Don Croce , a skilled murderer , a brutal extorter , a member of the dreaded Friends of the Friends , could not comfortablycount on all this to protect him from the family that had been disgraced . It was a matter of honor , and if not for the indemnity , they would have had to kill him no matter what the consequences . By combining generosity with prudence , Croce Malo acquired the respectful title of " Don . " By the time he was forty years old he was acknowledged as the foremost of the Friends of the Friends and was called upon to adjudicate the most desperate disputes between rival cosce of the Mafia , to settle the most savage vendettas . He was reasonable , he was clever , he was a born diplomat , but most important of all , he did not turn faint at the sight of blood . He became known as the " Don of Peace " throughout the Sicilian Mafia , and everyone prospered ; the stubbornwere eliminated with judicious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his brother , Benjamino , had become a secretary to the Cardinal of Palermo , but blood was thicker than holy water and he owed his first allegiance to Don ( ' roce . He married and became father to a little boy he adored . Don ( ' roce , not so prudent as he was later to become , not so humble as he later learned to be.under the whip of adversity , engineered a coup that made him famous all through Sicily , and an object of wonder to the highest circle of Roman society . This coupM A R I O P U Z O sprang from a bit of marital discord which even the greatest men in history have had to endure . Don Croce , because of his position in the Friends of the Friends , had married into a proud family who had recently bought patents of nobility for such a huge sum that the blood in their veins turned blue . After a few years of marriage , his wife treated him with a lack of respect he knew he had to correct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His wife 's blue blood had made her disenchanted with Don Croce 's no-nonsense , earthy peasant ways , his practice of saying nothing if he had nothing to the point to say , his casual attire , his habit of rough command in all things . There was also the remembrance of how all her other suitors melted away when Don Croce announced his candidacy for her hand . She did not of course show her disrespect in any obvious fashion . This was , after all , Sicily , not England or America . But the Don was an extraordinarily sensitive soul . He soon observed that his wife did not worship the ground upon which he walked , and that was proof enough of her disrespect . He became deter- mined to win her devotion in such a way that it would last a lifetime and he could then devote his full attention to business . His supple mind wrestled with the problem and came up with a plan worthy of Machiavelli himself . The King of Italy was coming to Sicily to visit his devoted subjects , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government and feared the Mafia . But they loved the monarchy because it extended their family , which consisted of blood rela- tions , the Virgin Mary and God himself . Great festivals were prepared for the King 's visit . On his first Sunday in Sicily the King went to Mass at the great Cathedral of Palermo . He was to stand godfather to the son of one of the ancient nobles of Sicily , the Prince 011orto . The King was already godfather to at least a hundred children , sons of field marshals , dukes and the most powerful men of the Fascist party . These were political acts to cement relationships between the crown and the executives of the government . Royal godchildren automatically became Cavaliers of the Crown and were sent the documents and sash to prove the honor given them . Also a small silver cup . Don Croce was ready . He had three hundred people in the festival throng . His brother , Benjamino , was one of the priests officiating at the ceremony . The baby of Prince 011orto was baptized , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the baby aloft in triumph . The crowd roared its approval . Prince 011orto was one of the less hated of the gentry , a slim handsome man ; looks always counted for something in Sicily . At that moment a crowd of Don Croce 's people surged into the cathedral and effectively blocked the King 's exit . The King was a little man with a mustache thicker than the hair on his head . He was in the full gaudy uniform of the Cavaliers , which made him look like a toy soldier . But despite his pompous appearancehe was extremely kindhearted , so when Father Benjaminothrust another swaddled infant into his arms he was bewildered but did not protest . The surging crowd had , on Don Croce 's instructions , cut him off from his retinue and the officiatingCardinal of Palermo so they could not interfere . Father Benjamino hastily sprinkled holy water from a nearby font and then snatched the baby out of the King 's arms and handed it to Don Croce . Don Croce 's wife wept tears of happiness as she knelt before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only child . She could ask no more . DoN CROCE grew fat and the bony face grew cheeks that were huge slabs of mahogany ; his nose became a great beak that served as an antenna for power . His crinkly hair grew into a barbed-wire gray . His body ballooned majestically ; his eyes becamelidded with flesh that grew like a heavy moss over his face . His power increased with each pound until he seemed to become an impenetrable obelisk . He seemed to have no weaknesses as116 I I 7M A R I O P U Z O 3 THE S I C I L I A Na man ; he never showed anger , never showed greed . He was affectionate in an impersonal way but never showed love . He was conscious of his grave responsibilities and so never voiced his fears in his wife 's bed or on her breast . He was the true King of Sicily . But his son  --  the heir apparent  --  was struck with the strange disease of religious social reform and had emigrated to Brazil to educate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was so shamed he never uttered his son 's name again . At the beginning of Mussolini 's rise to power , Don Croce was not impressed . He had observed him carefully and had come to the conclusion that the man had neither cunning nor courage . And if such a one could rule Italy then it followed that he , Don Croce , could rule Sicily . But then calamity fell . After a few years in power Mussolini turned his baleful eye on Sicily and the Mafia . He recognized that this was not a raggedy set of criminals but a true inner government that controlled a part of his empire . And he recognizedthat all through history the Mafia had conspired against whatever government ruled in Rome . Rulers of Sicily for the last thousand years had tried and failed . Now the Dictator vowed to strike them down forever . The Fascists did not believe in democracy , the legal rule of society . They did what they pleased for what they regarded as the good of the state . In short , they used the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trusted Minister , Cesare Mori , to Sicilyas a Prefect with unlimited powers . Mori started by suspendingthe rule of all judicial courts in Sicily and bypassing all legal safeguards of Sicilians . He flooded Sicily with troops who were ordered to shoot and ask questions later . He arrested and deportedentire villages . Before the dictatorship , Italy had had no capital punishment , which left it at a disadvantage against the Mafia , which used death as its chief enforcing tool . All this changed under the Prefect Mori . Proud Mafiosi , who adhered to the law of omerta , resisting even the dreaded cassetta , were shot . So-called conspiratorswere exiled to small isolated islands in the Mediterra-nean . In a year the island of Sicily was decimated , the Mafia destroyed as a governing force . It was of no consequence to Rome that thousands of innocent people were caught up in this wide net and suffered with the guilty . DON CROCE loved the fair rules of democracy and was outraged by the actions of the Fascisti . Friends and colleagues were jailed on trumped-up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evidence of their crimes . Many were imprisoned on hearsay , secret information from scoundrels who could not be tracked down and reasoned with , because they did not have to appear in open court and testify . Where was judicial fair play ? The Fascists had gone back to the days of the Inquisition , of the divine right of kings . Don Croce had never believed in the divine right of kings , indeed he asserted that no reasonable human being had ever believed in it except when the alternative was being torn apart by four wild horses . Even worse , the Fascists had brought back the cassetta , that medieval instrument of torture  --  a terrible box three feet long , two feet wide , which worked wonders on stubborn bodies . Even the most determined Mafioso found his tongue as loose as the morals of an Englishwoman when subject to the cassetta . Don Croce indignantly boasted that he had never used torture of any kind . Simple murder sufficed . Like a stately whale , Don Croce submerged himself in the murky waters of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monk , under Abbot Manfredi 's protection . They had had a long and pleasurable association . The Don , though proud of his illiteracy , had been obliged to employ the Abbot to write necessary ransom letters when early in his career he had followed the trade of kidnapping . They had always been honest with each other . They found they had common tastes  --  loose women , good wine and complex thievery . TheI19M A R I O P U Z ODon had often taken the Abbot on trips to Switzerland to visit his doctors and sample the placid luxuries of that country . A restful and pleasant change from the more dangerous pleasures of Sicily . When World War II started , Mussolini could no longer give Sicily his closest attention . Don Croce immediately took this opportunity to very quietly build up lines of communication with the remaining Friends of the Friends , sending messages of hope to the old Mafia stalwarts who had been exiled on the tiny islandsof Pantelleria and Stromboli . He befriended the families of those Mafia leaders who had been imprisoned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope , ultimately , was an Allied victory , and that he must exert all his efforts to that end . He made contact with underground partisan groups and gave orders to his men to aid any Allied pilots who survived being shot down . And so , at the crucial hour , Don Croce was prepared . When the American Army invaded Sicily in July of 1943 , Don Croce extended his helping hand . Were there not many fellow Sicilians in this invading army , the sons of immigrants ? Should Sicilian fight against Sicilian for the sake of the Germans ? Don Croce 's men persuaded thousands of Italian soldiers to desert and retire to a hiding place prepared for them by the Mafia . Don Croce personally made contact with secret agents of the AmericanArmy and led the attacking forces through mountain passagesso that they could outflank the entrenched German heavy guns . And so while the British invading force on the other side of the island met with huge casualties and could only advance slowly , the American Army accomplished its mission far ahead of schedule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself , though now almost sixty-five years of age and enormously heavy , led a band of Mafioso partisans into the city of Palermo and kidnapped the German general commanding its defense . He hid with his prisoner in the city until the front was broken and the American Army marched in . The AmericanSupreme Commander of southern Italy referred to Don Croce in his dispatches to Washington as " General Mafia . " And so he was known by American staff officers in the months that followed . THE AMERICAN Military Governor of Sicily was a Colonel AlfonsoLa Ponto . As a high-ranking politician in the state of New Jersey , he had received a direct commission and had been trained for this particular job . His greatest assets were his affabilityand knowing how to put together a political deal . His staff officers in military government had been chosen for similar qualifications . The headquarters of AMGOT consisted of twenty officersand fifty enlisted men . Many of them were of Italian extraction . Don Croce took all of them to his bosom with the sincere love of a blood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This despite the fact that with his friends he often referred to them as our " Lambs in Christ . " But Don Croce had " delivered the goods , " as the Americans often said . Colonel La Ponto made Don Croce his chief adviser and boon companion . The Colonel came often to dine at his house and groaned with pleasure eating the familiar cooking . The first problem to be solved was appointing new mayors for all the small towns in Sicily . The former mayors had been Fascists , of course , and had been thrown into American prisons . Don Croce recommended Mafia leaders who had been imprisoned . Since their records clearly showed that they had been tortured and jailed by the Fascist government for resistance to the aims and welfare of the state , it was assumed that the crimes of ' which they were accused were trumped-up charges . Don Croce , over his wife 's superb fish and spaghetti dishes , told beautiful stories about how his friends , murderers and thieves gill , had refused to surrender their beliefs in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delighted at findingso quickly the ideal people to run the civilian populationM A R I O P U Z Ounder his direction . Within a month most of the towns in WesternSicily had as their mayors a set of the most diehard Mafiosi to be found in Fascist prisons . And they functioned superbly for the American Army . Only a minimum of Occupation troops had to be left behind to preserve order over the conquered people . As the war continued on the mainland , there was no sabotage behind American lines , no spies roamed . Black-marketing by the common people was held to a minimum . The Colonel received a special medal and promotionto Brigadier General . Don Croce 's Mafia mayors enforced the smuggling laws with the utmost severity and the carabinieri patrolled the roads and mountain bypasses ceaselessly . It was like old times . Don Croce gave orders to both . Government inspectors made sure that stubborn farmers turned in their grain and olives and grapes to government warehouses at officially set prices  --  these , of course , to be rationed out to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ requested and received the loan of American Army trucks to transport these foodstuffs to the starving cities of Palermo , Monreale , and Trapani , to Syracuse and Catania , and even to Naples on the mainland . The Americans marveled at Don Croce 's efficiency and awarded him written commendationsfor his services to the armed forces of the United States . But Don Croce could not eat these commendations , he could not even read them for his pleasure , as he was illiterate . The backslappings of Colonel La Ponto did not fill his enormous belly . Don Croce , not trusting to the gratitude of the Americans or the blessings given by God for virtue , was determined that his many good works in the service of humanity and democracy be rewarded . So these cram-filled American trucks , their drivers armed with official road passes signed by the Colonel , rolled to quite different destinations designated by Don Croce . They unloadedat the Don 's own personal warehouses located in small towns like Montelepre , Villaba and Partinico . Then Don Croce and his colleagues sold them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ L I A Non the flourishing black market . So he cemented his relationshipswith the most powerful leaders of the resurgent Mafia . For Don Croce believed that greediness was the greatest of all human failings , and he shared his profits freely . He was more than generous . Colonel La Ponto received magnificentpresents of antique statues , paintings and ancient jewelry . It was the Don 's pleasure . The officers and men of the American Military Government detachment were like sons to him , and like any doting father he showered them with gifts . These men , specially chosen for their understanding of Italian character and culture , since many of them were of Sicilian origin , returned his love . They signed special travel passes , they maintained the trucks assigned to Don Croce with particular care . They went to his parties where they met good Sicilian girls and became entwined in the loving warmth which is the other side of the Sicilian character . Taken into these Sicilian families , fed the familiar food of their emigrant mothers , many of them wooed Mafioso @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resume his former power . Mafia chiefs all over Sicily were in his debt . He controlled the artesian wells that sold water to the population of the island at prices that would give him a good profit . He created the monopolies on foodstuffs ; he levied a tax on every market stall that sold fruit , every butcher shop that sold meat , the cafes with their coffee bars , and even the strolling bands of musicians . Since the only source of gasoline was the American Army , he controlled that also . He furnished overseers to the huge estates of the nobility , and in time planned to buy their lands at cheap prices . He was on the road to establishing the kind of power he wielded before Mussolini took over Italy . He was determined to become rich again . In the coming years he would , as the saying goes , put Sicily through his olive press . Only one thing truly troubled Don Croce . His only son had gone mad with the eccentric desire to do good deeds . His brother , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had12 ; no one of his blood to whom to bequeath his empire . He had no trusted warrior chieftain , young and tied by blood , to be a mailed fist when his velvet glove proved unpersuasive . The Don 's people had already marked young Salvatore Guiliano , and the Abbot Manfredi had confirmed his potential . Now more legends of this young boy 's exploits were sweeping Sicily . The Don smelled an answer to his only problem . THE MORNING after their escape from Montelepre , Turi Guilianoand Aspanu Pisciotta bathed in a swift-running stream behind their cave on Monte d'Ora . They took their guns to the edge of the cliff and spread out a blanket to enjoy the pinkstreakeddawn . The Grotta Bianca was a long cave that ended in a mass of boulders that reached to the ceiling , or almost . When they were little boys Turi and Aspanu had managed to squeeze over those boulders and discover a passage that ran right through to the other side of the mountain . It had existed before Christ , dug by . ' the army @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , tiny as a toy village , lay Montelepre . The many paths that led to their cliff were thin chalky worms which clungI* to the sides of the mountains . One by one the gray stone houses of Montelepre were turned to gold by the rising sun . The morning air was clear , the prickly pears on the ground were cool and sweet and Turi picked one up and bit into it carefully to freshen his mouth . In a few hours the heat of the sun would turn them into juiceless cottony balls . Gecko lizards , with huge balloonlike heads on tiny insect legs , crawled over his hand , but they were harmless despite their obscenely frightening , appearance . He flicked them aside . While Aspanu cleaned the guns , Turi watched the town125M A R I O P U Z Obelow . His naked eye picked out tiny black dots , people going into the countryside to work their little pieces of land . He tried to locate his own house . Long ago he and Aspanu had flown the flags of Sicily and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had accepted praise as patriots , but the real reasonwas to keep the house under observation while they roamed the tops of the nearby mountains  --  a reassuring link to the adult world . Suddenly he remembered something that had happened ten years ago . The Fascist officials of the village had ordered them to take down the American flag from the Guiliano roof . The two boys had been so enraged that they had taken down both flags , the American and the Sicilian . Then they had taken the flags to their secret hideout , the Grotta Bianca , and buried the flags near the wall of boulders . Guiliano said to Pisciotta , " Keep an eye on those trails , " and went into the cave . Even after ten years , Guiliano remembered exactly where they had buried the flags , in the right-hand corner where the boulders met the earth . They had dug in the dirt underneath the boulder , then packed the earth back over it . A mat of thin , slimy , green-black moss had grown over the spot . Guiliano @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small stone as a pick . In a matter of minutes the flags were uncovered . The American flag was a slimy mess of rags , but they had wrapped the Sicilian flag inside the American one , and the shielded one had survived . Guiliano flipped it open , the scarlet and gold colors as bold as when he was a child . There was not even a hole in it . He brought it outside and said to Pisciotta , laughing , " Do you remember this , Aspanu ? " Pisciotta stared at the flag . Then he too laughed , but in a more excited way . " It 's fate , " he shouted and jumped up and snatched the flag from Guiliano 's hand . He went to the cliff 's edge and waved it at the town below . They did not even have to speak to each other . Guiliano tore off a sapling that grew on the cliff face . They dug a hole and propped the sapling up with126THE S I C I L I A Nstones , then attached the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the world to see . Finally , they sat on the cliff edge to wait . IT WAS midday before they saw anything and then it was just a lone man riding a donkey on the dusty path that led to their cliff . They watched for another hour and then as the donkey entered the mountain range and took the upward path , Pisciotta said , " Damn , that rider is smaller than his donkey . It must be your godfather , Adonis . " Guiliano recognized the contempt in Pisciotta 's voice . Pisciotta  --  soslender , so dapper , so well formed  --  had a horror of physical deformity . His tubercular lungs , which sometimes bloodied his mouth , disgusted him , not because of the danger to his life , but because it marred what he thought of as his beauty . Sicilians have a fondness for giving people nicknames related to their physical failings or abnormalities , and once a friend had called Pisciotta " Paper Lungs . " Pisciotta had tried to stab him with his pocketknife . Only Guiliano 's strength had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few miles and hid behind a huge granite rock . It was one of his childhood games with Aspanu . He waited for Adonis to pass him on the trail , then he stepped out from his sheltering rock and called , " Stand where you are . " He pointed his lupara . Again it was the childhood game . Adonis turned slowly in such a way that he shielded the drawing of his pistol . But Guiliano , laughing , had stepped behind the sheltering rock ; only the barrel of his lupara gleamed in the sunlight . Guiliano called , " Godfather , it 's Turi , " and waited until Adonis put his gun back into his waistband and shrugged out of his knapsack . Then Guiliano lowered his lupara and stepped into the open . Guiliano knew that Hector Adonis always had trouble dismounting because of his short legs and he wanted to help him . But when he appeared on the path the Professor slidI27M A R I O P U Z Odown quickly , and they embraced . They walked up to the cliff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man , you 've burned your bridges , " Hector Adonis said in his professional voice . " Two more dead policemenafter last night . It 's no longer a joke . " When they arrived on the cliff face and Pisciotta greeted him , Adonis said , " As soon as I saw the Sicilian flag I knew you were up here . " Pisciotta grinned and said good-humoredly , " Turi and myself and this mountain have seceded from Italy . " Hector Adonis gave him a sharp look . That self-centeredness of youth , stating its own supreme importance . " The whole town has seen your flag , " Adonis said . " Includingthe Maresciallo of the carabinieri . They will be coming up to take it down . " Pisciotta said impudently , " Always the schoolmaster giving knowledge . They 're welcome to our flag , but that is all they 'll find here . We 're safe at night . It would be a miracle for the carabinieri to come out of their barracks after dark . " Adonis ignored him and unpacked the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of powerful binoculars and a first-aid kit , a clean shirt , some underwear , a knitted sweater , a shaving kit with his father 's straight-edge razor and six bars of soap . " You will need these up here , " he said . Guiliano was delighted with the field glasses . They headed the list of things he needed to acquire in the next few weeks . He knew his mother had hoarded the soap over the last year . In a separate package were a huge hunk of grainy cheese speckled with pepper , a loaf of bread , and two large round cakes that were really bread stuffed with prosciutto ham and mozzarellacheese and crowned with hard-boiled eggs . Adonis said , " La Venera sent you the cakes . She says she always baked them for her husband when he was in the mountains . You can live on one for a week . " Pisciotta smiled slyly and said , " The older they get the better the taste . " 12KTHE S I C I L I A NThe two young men sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Pisciotta used his knife to cut off hunks of the cheese . The grass around them was alive with insects , so they put the food sack on top of a granite boulder . They drank water from a clear stream that ran only a hundred feet below them . Then they rested where they could see over the cliff . Hector Adonis sighed . " You two are very pleased with your- selves , but it is no joke . If they catch you , they 'll shoot you . " Guiliano said calmly , " And if I catch them , I 'll shoot them . " Hector Adonis was shocked at this . There would never be hope of a pardon . " Do n't be rash , " he said . " You 're still only a boy . " Guiliano looked at him for a long moment . " I was old enough for them to shoot me over a piece of cheese . Do you expect me to run ? To let my family starve ? To let you bring me packages of food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come to kill me , and so I 'll kill them . And you , my dear godfather . When I was a child , did n't you lecture me on the miserable life of the Sicilian peasant ? How oppressed they are , by Rome and its tax collectors , by the nobility , by rich landowners who pay for our labor with lire that can barely keep us alive ? I went to the mar- ketplace with two hundred other men of Montelepre and they hid for us as if we were cattle . A hundred lire for a morning 's work they said , take it or leave it . And most of the men had to take it . Who then will be the champion of Sicily , if not Salvatore Guiliano ? " Hector Adonis was truly dismayed . It was bad enough to be an outlaw , but to be a revolutionary was more dangerous . " That 's all very well in literature , " he said . " But in real life you can go to an early grave . " He paused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other night do ? Your neighbors are till in jail . " " I 'll free them , " Guiliano said quietly . He could see the as- tonishment on his godfather 's face . He wanted his approval , his help , his understanding . He could see that Adonis still thought of him as the good-hearted village youth . " You must understand129M A R I O P U Z Ohow I am now . " He paused for a moment . Could he say exactly what he thought ? Would his godfather think him insanely proud ? But he went on . " I am not afraid of dying . " He smiled at Hector Adonis , the boyish smile Adonis knew so well and loved . " Really , I 'm astonished by it myself . But I 'm not afraid of being killed . It does n't seem possible to me . " He laughed aloud . " Their field police , their armored cars , their machine guns , all of Rome . I 'm not afraid of them . I can beat them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Passatempo and his band . Terra- nova . They defy Rome . What they can do , I can do . " Hector Adonis felt a mixture of amusement and anxiety . Had the wound affected Guiliano 's brain ? Or was what he saw now the same as the beginning of history 's heroes , the Alexanders , the Caesars , the Rolands ? When did the dreams of heroes begin , if not when sitting in a lonely glen , talking to dear friends . But he said casually , " Forget about Terranova and Passatempo . They have been captured and are sitting in the jail at the Bel- lampo Barracks . They will be transported to Palermo in a few days . " Guiliano said , " I 'll rescue them , and then I 'll expect their gratitude . " The grimness with which he said this astonished Hector Adonis and delighted Pisciotta . It was startling to them to see the change in their Guiliano . They had always loved and re- spected him . He had always had great dignity and poise for such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they sensed his drive for power . Hector Adonis said , " Gratitude ? Passatempo killed the uncle who gave him his first donkey . " " Then I must teach him the meaning of gratitude , " Guiliano said . He paused for a moment . " And now I have a favor to ask of you . Think it over carefully , and if you refuse , I will still be your devoted godson . Forget that you 're the dear friend of my parents and forget your affection for me . I ask this favor for the Sicily you taught me to love . Be my eyes and ears in Palermo . " 130THE S I C I L I A NHector Adonis said to him , " What you 're asking me , as Professorat the University of Palermo , is to become a member of your band of outlaws . " Pisciotta said impatiently , " That 's not so strange in Sicily , where everyone is hooked to the Friends of the Friends . And where else but in Sicily does a Professor of History @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the young men as he pondered his answer . He could easily promise to help and forget his promise . He could just as easily refuse and promise only to give the aid a friend would give from time to time , as he was doing today . After all , the comedy might be short . Guiliano might be killed fighting or betrayed . He might emigrate to America . And the problem would be solved , he thought sadly . Hector Adonis remembered a long-ago summer day , a day very like this one , when Turi and Aspanu were no more than eight years old . They had been sitting in the pasture lying between the Guiliano house and the mountains , waiting for supper . Hector Adonis had brought a bag of books for Turi . One of them was the Song of Roland , and he had read it to them . Adonis knew the poem almost by heart . It was dear to every literate Sicilian , and its story was beloved by the illiterate . It was the mainstay of the puppet theater that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were painted on the side of every wagon that rolled along the Sicilian hills . Emperor Charlemagne 's two great knights , Roland and Oliver , slaughteredthe Saracens , protecting their Emperor 's retreat into France . Adonis told how they had died together in the great battle of Roncevalles  --  how Oliver begged three times for Rolandto blow his horn to bring back Charlemagne 's army and how Roland refused out of pride . And then when the Saracens overwhelmed them , Roland blew his great horn , but it was too late . When Charlemagne returned to rescue his knights , he found their bodies among the thousands of dead Saracens and rent his heard . Adonis remembered the tears in Turi Guiliano's1 ; 1MARIO PUZOeyes and , oddly enough , the look of scorn on the face of Aspanu Pisciotta . To one it was the greatest moment a man could live , to the other child it was a humiliating death at the hands of the infidel . The two young boys had gotten up from the grass to run into the house for supper . Turi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had smiled at the gesture . It was Roland holding Oliver erect so that they could both die on their feet before the charging Saracens . Roland , dying , had reached out his gauntlet to the azure sky , and an angel had plucked it from his hand . Or so the poem and legend said . That was a thousand years ago , but Sicily still suffered in the same brutal landscape of olive groves and scorching plains , of roadside shrines built by the first followers of Christ , the countlesscrosses holding the crucified rebellious slaves led by Spartacus . And his godson would be another of these heroes , not understanding that for Sicily to change , there would have to be a moral volcano that would incinerate the land . As Adonis watched them now , Pisciotta lounging on his back in the grass , Guiliano staring at him with dark brown eyes and with a smile that seemed to say he knew exactly what his godfatherwas thinking , a curious transformation of the scene took place . Adonis saw them as statues carved in marble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became a figure on a vase , the gecko in his hand an adder , all finely etched in the morning sunlight of the mountains . Pisciotta looked dangerous , a man who filled the world with poison and daggers . Salvatore Guiliano , his godson Turi , was the other side of the vase . His had the beauty of some Greek Apollo , the features fully molded flesh , the eyes with whites so clear they gave almost the impression of blindness . His face was open and frank with the innocence of a legendary hero . Or rather , thought Adonis , rejecting his sentimentality , the resolution of a young man determined to be heroic . His body had the muscular fleshinessof those Mediterranean statues , the heavy thighs , the mus-I32THE S I C I L I A Ncular back . His body was American , taller and broader than most Sicilians ' . Even when they were boys Pisciotta had showed a practical cunning . Guiliano had been the generous believer in the goodnessof man , and proud of his own truthfulness . In those days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leader when they were men , Guiliano the follower . But he should have known better . A belief in one 's own virtue is far more dangerous than a belief in one 's cunning . Pisciotta 's mocking voice broke into these daydreams of HectorAdonis . " Please say yes , Professor . I am the second in command of Guiliano 's band , but I have no one under me to give orders . " He was grinning . " I am willing to start small . " Though Adonis was not provoked , Guiliano 's eyes flashed with anger . But he said quietly , " What is your answer ? " Hector Adonis said , " Yes . " What else could a godfather say ? Then Guiliano told him what he had to do when he returned to Montelepre and outlined his plans for the next day . Adonis was again appalled at the boldness and ferocity of this young man 's schemes . But when Guiliano lifted him onto his donkey he leaned over and kissed his godson . Pisciotta and Guiliano watched Adonis riding down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little man , " Pisciotta said . " He would have fitted in much better when we were playing bandits as children . " Guiliano turned to him and said gently , " And your jokes would have been better then . Be serious when we talk of serious things . " But that night before they went to sleep , they embraced each other . " You are my brother , " Guiliano said . " Remember that . " Then they wrapped themselves in their blankets and slept away the last night of their obscurity. 133CHAPTER9TuRI GUILIANO and Aspanu Pisciotta were up before the dawn , before the first light , for though it was unlikely , the carabinierimight start in darkness to surprise them with the morning sun . They had seen the armored car from Palermo arrive in the Bellampo Barracks late the evening before with two jeeploads of reinforcements . During the night Guiliano made scouting patrolsdown the side of the mountain and listened for any sounds that would be made by anyone approaching their cliff  --  a precautionPisciotta ridiculed . " When we were children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Guiliano , " but do you think those lazy carabinieri will risk their lives in darkness , or even miss a good night 's sleep in soft beds ? " " We have to train ourselves into good habits , " Turi Guiliano said . He knew that someday there would be better enemies . Turi and Aspanu worked hard laying out guns on a blanket and checking them in every detail . Then they ate some of La Venera 's bread cake , washed down with a flask of wine Hector Adonis had left them . The cake , with its heat and spices , lay glowingly in their stomachs . It gave them the energy to constructa screen of saplings and boulders on the edge of the cliff . Behind this screen , they watched the town and the mountain paths with their binoculars . Guiliano loaded the guns and put boxes of ammunition into the pockets of his sheepskin iacketwhile Pisciotta kept watch . Guiliano did his job carefully and slowly . He even buried all the supplies and covered the ground with huge rocks himself . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So it was Pisciotta who spotted the armored car leaving the Bellampo Barracks . " You 're right , " Pisciotta said . " The car is going down the Castellammare plain away from us . " They grinned at each other . Guiliano felt a quiet elation . Fighting the police would not be so difficult after all . It was a child 's game with a child 's cunning . The armored car would disappear around a curve of the road and then circle back and come into the mountains to the rear of their cliff . The authorities must know about the tunnel and expect them to use it to escape and run right into the armored car . And its machine guns . In an hour the carabinieri would send a detachment up the sides to Monte d'Ora in a frontal attack to flush them out . It helped that the police thought of them as wild youths , simple outlaws . The scarlet and gold flag of Sicily that they flew from the cliff edge confirmed their careless impudence , or so the policewould think . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carrying the Maresciallo Roccofino left through the gates of the Bellampo Barracks . The two vehicles traveled leisurely to the foot of Monte d'Ora and stopped to unload . Twelve carabinieri armed with rifles deployedon the tiny paths that led up the slope . Maresciallo Roccofinotook off his braided cap and pointed it toward the scarlet and gold flag flying over the cliff above them . Turi Guiliano was watching through the binoculars from behind the screen of saplings . For a moment he worried about the armored car on the other side of the mountain . Would they have sent some men up the opposite slope ? But those men would take hours to climb , they could not be close . He put them out of his mind and said to Pisciotta , " Aspanu , if we 're not as clever as we think , we wo n't be going home to our mothers and a plate of spaghetti this night , as we used to do when we were children . " Pisciotta laughed . " We always hated going home , remember ? But I have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few of them ? " " No , " Guiliano said . " Fire over their heads . " He thought about how Pisciotta disobeyed him two nights before . He said , " Aspanu , obey me . There 's no point in killing them . It ca n't serve any purpose this time . " They waited patiently for an hour . Then Guiliano pushed his shotgun through the screen of saplings and fired twice . It was amazing how that straight confident line of men scattered so quickly , like darting ants disappearing into the grass . Pisciotta fired his rifle four times . Smoke puffs appeared in different parts of the slope as the carabinieri fired back . Guiliano put down his shotgun and took up the binoculars . He could see the Maresciallo and his Sergeant working a radio communicationsset . They would be contacting the armored car on the other side of the mountain , warning them that the outlaws would be on their way . He picked up his shotgun again and fired twice , then said to Pisciotta , " It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the far side of the cliff out of view of the advancing carabinieri , then slid down the boulderstrewnslope , rolling for fifty yards before they came to their feet , weapons ready . Crouched low , they ran down the hill stopping only for Guiliano to observe the attackers through his binoculars . The carabinieri were still firing up at the cliff , not realizing the two outlaws were now on their flanks . Guiliano led the way down a tiny , hidden path through massive boulders and entered a little forest . They rested for a few minutes and then they both started running down the path swiftly and silently . In less than an hour they emerged onto the plain that separated the mountainsfrom the town of Montelepre , but they had circled around to the far side of the town ; it lay between them and the troopcarryingvan . They hid their weapons under their jackets and walked across the plain , looking like two peasants on their wayto work in the fields . They entered Montelepre at the top of the Via Bella , only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same moment the Maresciallo Roccofino ordered his men to continue climbing the slopes toward the flag on the edge of the cliff . There had been no answering fire for the last hour and he was sure the two outlaws had fled through their tunnel and were now going down the other side of the mountain toward the armored car . He wanted to close the trap . It took his men another hour to reach the cliff edge and tear down the flag . Maresciallo Roccofino went into the cave and had the boulders pushed aside to open up the tunnel . He sent his men down that stone corridor and down the other side of the mountain to rendezvous with the armored car . He was astounded when he found that his quarry had escaped him . He broke up his men into searching and scouting parties , sure they would flush the fugitivesfrom their holes . HECTOR ADONIS had followed Guiliano 's instructions perfectly . At the top of the Via Bella was a painted cart , the ancient legendscovering every inch , inside and out . Even the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tiny armored figures so that when the wheels rolled they cleverly gave the illusion of men whirling in combat . The shafts too were colored in bright red curlicues with silver dots . The cart looked like a man with tattoos that covered every inch of his body . Between the shafts stood a sleepy white mule . Guiliano jumped into the empty driver 's seat and looked into the cart . It was packed with huge jugs of wine cradled into bamboo baskets . There were at least twenty of them . Guiliano slipped his shotgun behind a row of jugs . He gave a quick look toward the mountains ; there was nothing to be seen , except the flag still flying . He grinned down at Pisciotta . " Everything is in place , " he said . " Go and do your little dance . " Pisciotta gave a little salute , serious yet mocking , buttonedMARIO Puzohis jacket over his pistol , and started walking toward the gates of the Bellampo Barracks . As he walked he glanced down the road that led to Castellammare , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its way back from the mountains . High up on the cart seat , Turi Guiliano watched Pisciotta walk slowly across the open field and onto the stone path that led to the gate . Then he looked down the Via Bella . He could see his house , but there was nobody standing in front of it . He had hoped he might catch a glimpse of his mother . Some men were sitting in front of one of the houses , their table and wine bottles shaded by an overhanging balcony . Suddenly he remembered the binoculars around his neck and he unclipped the strap and threw them into the back of the cart . A young carabiniere stood guard at the gate , a boy no more than eighteen . His rosy cheeks and hairless face proclaimed his birth in the northern provinces of Italy ; his black uniform with white piping , baggy and untailored , and his braided fiercely militarycap gave him the look of some puppet or clown . Against regulations he had a cigarette in his adolescent , cupid 's bow mouth . Approaching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Even after what had happened in the last few days the man did not have his rifle ready . The guard only saw a scruffy peasant who dared to grow a mustache more elegant than he deserved . He said roughly , " You there , you lump , where do you think you 're going ? " He did not unsling his rifle . Pisciotta could have cut his throat in a second . Instead he tried to look obsequious , tried to suppress his mirth at this child 's arrogance . He said , " If you please , I wish to see the Maresciallo . I have some valuable information . " " You can give it to me , " the guard said . Pisciotta could not help himself . He said scornfully , " And can you pay me too ? " The guard was astounded by this impudence . Then he said contemptuously but a little warily , " I would n't pay you a lira if you told me Jesus had come again . " THE SICILIANPisciotta grinned . " Better than that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man who bloodied your noses . " The guard said suspiciously , " Since when does a Sicilian help the law in this damned country ? " Pisciotta moved a little closer . " But I have ambitions , " he said . " I 've put in an application to become a carabiniere . Next month I go to Palermo for my examination . Who knows , both of us might soon be wearing the same uniform . " The guard looked at Pisciotta with a more friendly interest . It was true that many Sicilians became policemen . It was a road out of poverty , it was a small piece of power . It was a wellknownnational joke that Sicilians became either criminals or policemen and that they did equal damage on both sides . MeanwhilePisciotta was laughing inwardly at the thought that he would ever become a carabiniere . Pisciotta was a dandy ; he owned a silk shirt made in Palermo . Only a fool would preen in that white-piped black uniform and that ridiculous braided stiff billed cap . " You 'd better think twice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be in on a good thing . " The pay is small and we 'd all starve if we did n't take bribes from smugglers . And just this week two of the men of our barracks , good friends of mine , were killed by that damned Guiliano . And every day the insolenceof your peasants who wo n't even give you directions to the barber in town . " Pisciotta said gaily , " We 'll teach them some manners with the bastinado . " Then , with a confidential air , as if they were already brothers in arms , he said , " Have you a cigarette for me ? " To Pisciotta ' s delight , the moment of good will fled . The guard was outraged . " A cigarette for you ? " he said incredulously . " Why in Christ 's name should I give a piece of Sicilian dung a cigarette ? " And now finally the guard unslung his rifle . For a moment Pisciotta felt the savage urge to throw himself forward and slit the guard 's throat . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Pisciotta said . " Your comrades searchingthe mountains are too stupid to find even a gecko . " M A R I O P U Z O I THE S I C I L I A NThe guard looked bewildered . The insolence had him confused ; the information offered made him realize he had better consult his superior . He had a feeling that this man was too slippery and could get him into trouble of some kind . He opened the gate and motioned Pisciotta with his rifle to enter the grounds of the Bellampo Barracks . His back was to the street . At that moment , Guiliano , a hundred yards away , kicked the mule awake and started his cart onto the stone pathway to the gate . The grounds of the Bellampo Barracks consisted of four acres . On the land was the large administration building with an L-shaped wing that held the jail cells . Behind it was the living barracks for the carabinieri themselves , large enough to hold a hundred men with a specially partitioned section that served as a private @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a garage for vehicles that was really a barn and still served partially as such since the detachment supported a troop of mules and donkeys for mountain travel where mechanical vehicleswere useless . Far in the rear were a munitions shed and a supply shed , both made of corrugated steel . Surrounding the whole area was a seven-foot barbed wire fence with two high towers for sentries , but these had not been used for many months . The barracks had been built by the Mussolini regime and then enlarged during the war on the Mafia . When Pisciotta went through the gate he checked for danger signals . The towers were empty , there were no roaming armed guards . It looked like some peaceful deserted farm . There were no vehicles in the garage ; in fact there were no vehicles in sight anywhere , which surprised him , and made him worry that one would be returning soon . He could not conceive of the Maresciallobeing so stupid as to leave his garrison without a vehicle . He would have to warn Turi that they might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pisciotta entered the widedoors of the administration building . This was a huge room with ceiling fans which did little to dispel the heat . There was a large raised desk dominating the room , and on the sides were railings which enclosed smaller desks for clerks ; around the room were wooden benches . These were all empty except for the raised desk . Seated at this was a carabinieri corporal who was an altogetherdifferent proposition from the young guard . An ornate gold nameplate on the desk read CORPORAL CANIo SILVESTRO . The upper part of his body was massive  --  great shoulders and thick columnar neck crowned by a huge boulder of a head . A pink scar , a slab of shiny dead tissue , seemed pasted from his ear down to the end of his rocklike jaw . A long bushy handlebar mustache flew out like two black wings over his mouth . He wore the stripes of a corporal on his sleeve , a huge pistol at his belt and worst of all he regarded Pisciotta with the utmost suspicion and distrust as the guard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to be a Sicilian . " You are a lying piece of shit , " he said to Pisciotta . But before he could go any further , Guiliano 's voice could be heard shoutinginside the gate . " Hey there , carabiniere , do you want your wine or not ? Yes or no ? " Pisciotta admired the style of Guiliano 's voice ; the tone coarse , the dialect so thick it was almost unintelligible except to natives of this province , the choice of words arrogantly typical of the well-to-do peasant . The Corporal growled with exasperation , " What in Christ 's name is that fellow bellowing about ? " and with great strides was out the door . The guard and Pisciotta followed him . The painted cart and its white mule were outside the gate . Bare to the waist , his broad chest streaming with sweat , Turi Guiliano was swinging a jug of wine . There was a huge idiotic grin on his face ; his whole body seemed oafishly askew . His appearance disarmed suspicion . There could be no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accent was that of140 141M A R I O P U Z Othe most loutish dialect in all of Sicily . The Corporal 's hand dropped from his pistol , the guard lowered his rifle . Pisciotta took a step backward ready to draw his own gun from beneath his jacket . " I have a wagonload of wine for you , " Guiliano bawled out again . He blew his nose with his fingers and snapped the mucus off into the gate . " Who ordered this wine ? " the Corporal asked . But he was walking down to the gate and Guiliano knew he would open it wide to let the wagon through . " My father told me to bring it for the Maresciallo , " Guiliano said with a wink . The Corporal was staring at Guiliano . The wine was undoubtedly a gift for letting some farmer do a bit of smuggling . The Corporal thought uneasily that as a true Sicilian the father would have brought the wine himself to be more closely associated with the gift . But then he shrugged . " Unload @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Guiliano said , " Not by myself , I do n't . " Again the Corporal felt a twinge of doubt . Some instinct warned him . Realizing this , Guiliano climbed down from the wagon in such a way that he could easily snatch the lupara from its hiding place . But first he lifted up a jug of wine in its bamboo case and said , " I have twenty of these beauties for you . " The Corporal roared out a command toward the quarters barracksand two young carabinieri came running out ; their jackets were unbuttoned and they wore no caps . Neither did they bear weapons . Guiliano standing on top of his cart thrust jugs of wine into their arms . He gave a jug to the guard with the rifle , who tried to refuse . Guiliano said with rough good humor , " You 'll certainly help drink it , so work . " Now with the three guards immobilized , their arms full of jugs , Guiliano surveyed the scene . It was exactly as he had wished . Pisciotta was directly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free . Guiliano scanned the slopes : there142THE S I C I L I A Nwas no sign of any of the searching party returning . He checked the road to Castellammare ; there was no sign of the armored car . Down the Via Bella the children were still playing . He reached into the wagon and pulled out the lupara and pointed it at the astonished Corporal . At the same time Pisciotta pulled the pistol from beneath his shirt . He pressed it against the Corporal'sback . " Do n't move an inch , " Pisciotta said , " or I 'll barber that great mustache of yours with lead . " Guiliano kept the lupara on the other three frightened guards . He said , " Keep those jugs in your arms and everybody go into the building . " The armed guard hugging the jug let his rifle drop to the ground . Pisciotta picked it up as they moved inside . In the office , Guiliano picked up the name plaque and admired it . " Corporal Canio Silvestro . Your keys , please . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his pistol and he glared at Guiliano . Pisciotta knocked his hand forward and plucked out his weapon . The Corporal turned and gave him a cold examining stare that was deadly . Pisciotta smiled and said , " Excuse me . " The Corporal turned to Guiliano and said , " My boy , run away and become an actor , you 're very fine . Do n't go on with this , you 'll never escape . The Maresciallo and his men will be back before nightfall and will hunt you to the ends of the earth . Think it over , my young fellow , what it is to be an outlaw with a price on your head . I 'll be hunting for you myself and I never forget a face . I 'll find out your name and dig you out if you hide yourself in hell . " Guiliano smiled at him . For some reason he liked the man . He said , " But if you want to know my name , why do n't you ask ? " The Corporal looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like an idiot ? " Guiliano said , " I never lie . My name is Guiliano . " The Corporal put his hand to his side for the pistol Pisciotta had already removed . Guiliano liked the man more for that instinctivereaction . He had courage and a sense of duty . The other guards were terrified . This was the Salvatore Guiliano who143M A R I O P U Z Ohad already killed three of their comrades . There was no reason to think that he would leave them alive . The Corporal studied Guiliano 's face , memorizing it , then , moving slowly and carefully , took a huge ring of keys from a desk drawer . He did so because Guiliano had the shotgun pressed tightly against his back . Guiliano took the keys from him and tossed them to Pisciotta . " Release those prisoners , " he said . In the prison wing of the administration building , in a large caged area , were ten citizens of Montelepre who had been arrestedthe night of Guiliano 's escape . In one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Passatempo and Terranova . Pisciotta unlocked their cell doors and they gleefully followed him into the other room . The arrested citizens of Montelepre , all neighbors of Guiliano , flooded into the office and crowded around Guiliano to embrace him with gratitude . Guiliano permitted this but was always alert , his eyes on the captive carabinieri . His neighbors were in a delighted good humor at Guiliano 's exploit ; he had humiliated the hated police , he was their champion . They told him that the Maresciallo had ordered them to be bastinadoed but the Corporalhad effectively stopped this punishment from being carried out by the sheer force of his character and his argument that such an action would create so much ill will that it would affect the safety of the barracks . Instead , the next morning they were to have been transported to Palermo to appear before a magistratefor interrogation . Guiliano held his lupara muzzle down to the floor , afraid that an accidental shot would go into the crowd around him . These men were all older , neighbors he had known as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he had always spoken to them . " You are welcome to come with me to the mountains , " he said . " Or you can go visit relatives in other parts of Sicily until the authoritiescome to their senses . " He waited but there was only silence . The two bandits , Passatempo and Terranova , stood aside144THE S I C I L I A Nfrom the others . They were extremely alert , as if poised to spring . Passatempo was a short , squat ugly man with a gross face marked by childhood smallpox , his mouth thick and unshaped . The peasants in the countryside called him " The Brute . " Terranova was small and built like a ferret . Yet his small features were pleasant , his lips molded into a natural smile . Passatempo had been the typical greedy Sicilian bandit who simply stole livestock and killed for money . Terranova had been a hard-working farmer and had started his career as an outlaw when two tax collectors came to confiscate his prize pig . He had killed both of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eat and then fled to the mountains . The two men had joined forces but had been betrayed and captured when they were hiding in a deserted warehouse in the grain fields of Corleone . Guiliano said to them , " You two have no choice . We will go to the mountains together and then if you like you can stay under my command or go off on your own . But for today I need your help and you do owe me a small service . " He smiled at them , trying to soften the demand that they submit to his orders . Before the two bandits could answer , the Corporal of the carabinieri committed an insane act of defiance . Perhaps it was out of some injured Sicilian pride , perhaps out of some inborn animal ferocity , or simply that the fact that the noted bandits in his custody were about to escape enraged him . He was standing only a few paces from Guiliano and with a surprising quickness he took a long step forward . At the same time he drew a small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to fire but he was too late . The Corporal thrust the pistol to within two feet of Guiliano 's head . The bullet would smash directly into Guiliano 's face . Everyone was frozen with shock . Guiliano saw the pistol pointed at his head . Behind it the red raging face of the Corporal was contorting its muscles like the body of a snake . But the pistol seemed to be coming very slowly . It was like falling in a145nightmare , falling forever and yet knowing it was only a dream and that he would never hit the bottom . In the fraction of a second before the Corporal pulled the trigger , Guiliano felt an enormous serenity and no fear . His eyes did not blink when the Corporal pulled the trigger , indeed he took a step forward . There was a loud metallic click as the hammer hit the defective ammunitionin the barrel . A fraction of a second afterward , he was swarmed over by Pisciotta , Terranova and Passatempo , and the Corporal was falling under the weight of bodies . Terranova @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Passatempo had the Corporal by the hair of his head and was trying to gouge out his eyes , Pisciotta had his knife out and ready to plunge it into the Corporal 's throat . Guiliano caught it just in time . Guiliano said quietly , " Do n't kill him . " And pulled them off the Corporal 's now prone and defenseless body . He looked down and was dismayed to see the damage that had been done in that flashing moment of mob fury . The Corporal 's ear was half-ripped off his skull and was bleeding great gouts of blood . His right arm hung grotesquely twisted at his side . One of his eyes was spouting blood , a great flap of skin hung over it . The man was still not afraid . He lay there awaiting death , and Guiliano felt an overwhelming wave of tenderness for him . This was the man who had put him to the test , and who had confirmedhis own immortality ; this was the man who had certified the impotence of ' death . Guiliano pulled him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others gave him a quick embrace . Then he pretended that he was merely helping the Corporal to stand erect . Terranova was examining the pistol . " You are a very fortunateman , " he said to Guiliano . " Only one bullet is defective . " Guiliano held out his hand for the gun . Terranova hesitated for a moment , then gave it to him . Guiliano turned to the Corporal . " Behave yourself , " he said in a friendly tone , " and nothingwill happen to you or your men . I guarantee it . " The Corporal , still too dazed and weak from his injuries to reply , did not even seem to understand what was being said . Passatempo whispered to Pisciotta , " Hand me your knife and I 'll finish him off . " Pisciotta said , " Guiliano gives the orders here and everybody obeys . " Pisciotta said it matter-of-factly so as not to alert Passatempothat he was ready to kill him in an instant . The Montelepre citizens who had been prisoners left hastily . They did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Guiliano shepherded the Corporal and his fellow guards to the prison wing and locked them in the communal cell together . Then he led Pisciotta , Terranova and Passatempo on a search through the other buildings of the Bellampo Barracks . In the weapons shed they found rifles , pistols and machine pistols , with boxes of ammunition . They draped the weapons over their bodies and loaded the boxes of ammunition into the cart . From the living quarters they took some blankets and sleeping bags and Pisciotta threw two carabinieri uniforms into the cart just for good luck . Then , with Guiliano in the driver 's seat , the cart brimming over the top with looted goods , the other three men , walking with weapons ready , spread out to protect against any attack . They moved quickly down the road toward Castellammare . It took them over an hour to make their way to the house of the farmer who had loaned Hector Adonis the cart and to bury their loot in his pigpen . Then they helped the farmer cover his cart with olive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maresciallo Roccofino returned with his search party in time for dinner ; the sun was falling out of the sky and it had never burned so brightly that day as the Maresciallo 's rage burned at the sight of his men imprisoned in their own cages . ' ' he Maresciallo sent his armored car screaming down all the roads for a trace of the outlaws , but by that time Guiliano was deep in the sanctuary of his mountains . NIwsPAt'FRS ALt , over Italy gave the story great prominence . Just three days before , the killing of the two other carabinieriM A R I O P U Z Ohad also been front-page news , but then Guiliano had just been another desperate Sicilian bandit whose only claim to fame was ferocity . This exploit was another matter . He had won a battle of wits and tactics against the National Police . He had freed his friends and neighbors from what was obviously an unjust imprisonment . Journalists from Palermo , Naples , Rome and Milan descended on the town of Montelepre , interviewing Turi Guiliano'sfamily and friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which she claimed he played like an angel . ( This was not true ; he was only beginning to play well enough to make his tune recognizable . ) His former schoolmates confessed that Turi was such a great reader of books that he had been nicknamed " The Professor . " The newspapers seized upon this with delight . A Sicilian bandit who could actually read . They mentioned his cousin Aspanu Pisciotta , who had joined him in his outlawry out of sheer friendship , and wondered at a man who could inspire such loyalty . That an old photograph taken of him when he was seventeen showed him to be incredibly handsome in a Mediterranean manly fashion made the whole story irresistible . But perhaps what appealed to the Italian people most of all was Guiliano 's act of mercy in sparing the Corporal who had tried to kill him . It was better than opera  --  it was more like the puppet shows so popular in Sicily , where the wooden figures never lost blood or had their flesh torn and mangled by bullets . The newspapers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such villains as Terranova and Passatempo , implyingthat two such evil companions might tarnish the image of this knight in shining armor . Only the Milan newspaper pointed out that Salvatore " Turi " Guiliano had already killed three members of the National Police , and suggested that special measures should be taken for his apprehension , that a murderer should not be excused his crimes merely because he was handsome , well-read and could play the guitar. 148CHAPTER10DON CROCE was now fully aware of Turi Guiliano and full of admiration for him . What a true Mafioso youth . He meant the usage , of course , in the old traditional form : a Mafioso face , a Mafioso tree , a Mafioso woman , that is , a thing foremost in beauty in its particular form . What a mailed fist this young man would be for Don Croce . What a warrior chief in the field . Don Croce forgave the fact that Guiliano was at present a thorn in his side . The two bandits imprisoned in Montelepre , the feared Passatempo and the clever Terranova , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But all this could be forgiven , bygones were bygones ; the Don never held a grudge that impaired his future profits . He would now track Turi Guiliano very carefully . I ) I ; EP IN the mountains , Guiliano had no knowledge of his growingfame . He was too busy making plans to build his power . His first problem was the two bandit chiefs , Terranova and Passatempo . He questioned them closely about their capture and came to the conclusion they had been betrayed , informed upon . They swore their men had been faithful and many had been killed in the trap . Guiliano pondered all this and came to the conclusion that the Mafia , which had acted as fences and go-149M A R I O P U Z Obetweens for the band , had betrayed them . When he mentioned this to the two bandits they refused to believe it . The Friends of the Friends would never break the sacred code of omerta which was so central to their own survival . Guiliano did not insist . Instead he made them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that his purpose was not only to survive but to become a political force . He emphasized that they would not rob the poor . Indeed half of the profit the band earned would be distributed to the needy in the provinces around the town of Montelepre reaching to the suburbs of Palermo . Terranova and Passatempo would rule their own subordinate bands but would be under Guiliano 's overall command . These subordinate bands would not launch any money-making expedition without Guiliano'sapproval . Together they would have absolute rule over the provinces that held the great city of Palermo , the city of Monreale , and the towns of Montelepre , Partinico and Corleone . He impressed upon them that they would take the offensiveagainst the carabinieri . That it would be the field police who would go in fear of their lives , not the bandits . They were astonished by this bravado . Passatempo , an old-fashioned bandit who believed in rape , small-time extortion and the murder of shepherds , immediately began pondering how he could profit by this association and then murder Guiliano and take his share @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was more grateful for his rescue , wondered how he could tactfully steer this talented young bandit on a more prudent path . Guiliano was now looking at them with a little smile , as if he could read their minds and was amused by what they thought . Pisciotta was used to the grand ideas of his lifelong friend . He believed . If Turi Guiliano said he could do something , Aspanu Pisciotta believed he could do it . So now he listened . In the bright morning sunlight that lit their mountains with gold they all three listened to Guiliano , spellbound as he told how they would lead the fight to make Sicilians a free people , 150THE S I C I L I A Nuplift the poor and destroy the power of the Mafia , the nobility and Rome . They would have laughed at anyone else , but they remembered what everyone who saw it would always remember : the Corporal of the carabinieri raising the pistol to Guiliano'shead . The quiet stare of Guiliano , his absolute confidence that he would not die , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The mercy he had shown to the Corporal after the pistol misfired . These were all acts of a man who believed in his own immortality and forced others to share that belief . And so now they stared at the handsome young man , and they were impressed by his beauty , his courage and his innocence . THE NEXT morning Guiliano led his three men , Aspanu Pisciotta , Passatempo and Terranova , down out of the mountains on a path that would let them out on the plains near the town of Castelvetrano . He came down very early to scout the ground . He and his men were dressed as laborers . He knew that truck convoys of foodstuffs passed by here on the way to bringing their wares to the markets of Palermo . The problem was how to get the trucks to stop . They would be going at high speed to foil hijackers and the drivers might be armed . Guiliano made his men hide in the underbrush of the road just outside Castelvetrano , then sat himself on a large white boulder in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fields stared at him with stony faces . They saw the lupara he was carrying and hurried on . Guiliano wondered if any of them had recognized him . Then he saw a legend-painted large cart coming down the road , drawn by a single mule . The old man driving was known by sight to Guiliano . He was one of the line of professional carters so plentiful in rural Sicily . He hired out his rig to haul bamboo from the outlying villages back to the factory in town . Long ago he had been to Montelepre and had done some hauling of produce for Guiliano 's father . Guiliano stepped into the middle of the road . The lupara dangled from his right hand . The151M A R I O P U Z O THE S I C I L I A Ndriver recognized him though there was no expression on his face , just a momentary flicker of the eyes . Guiliano greeted him with the familiar style he had used as a child , calling him Uncle . " Zu Peppino , " he said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am here to make your fortune and you are here to help me lighten the load of the poor . " He was genuinely delighted to see the old man and burst into laughter . The old man did n't answer . He stared at Guiliano , his stony face waiting . Guiliano climbed up on the cart and sat beside him . He put the lupara out of sight in the wagon and then he laughed again with excitement . Because of Zu Peppino he was sure this would be a lucky day . Guiliano relished the freshness of the late autumn , the beauty of the mountains on the horizon , the knowledge that his three men in the underbrush commanded the road with their guns . He explained his plan to Zu Peppino , who listened to him without a word or change of expression . That is , not until Guiliano told him what his reward would be : his cart full of food from the trucks . Then Zu Peppino grunted and said , " Turi Guiliano , you were always a fine , brave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sympathetic . You have not changed since you became a man . " Guiliano remembered now that Zu Peppino was one of those old school Sicilians given to flowery speech . " Count on my help in this and all other things . Give my regards to your father who should be proud to have such a son . " THE CONVOY of three trucks laden with foodstuffs appeared on the road at noontime . When they turned the curve that led straight out on the Partinico plain they had to stop . A cluster of carts and mules blocked the road completely . This had been contrived by Zu Peppino , to whom all the carters of the area owed favors and obedience . The lead truck driver blew his horn and inched his truck so that it nudged the nearest cart . The man on the cart turned and gave him such a look of malevolence that he immediately halted his truck and waited patiently . He knew that these carters , despitetheir humble profession , were proud fierce men who , in a matter of honor , their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to death and go on their way with a song on their lips . The other two trucks ground to a halt . The drivers got out . One of them was from the eastern end of Sicily and one was a foreigner ; that is , he came from Rome . The Roman driver approached the carters unzipping his jacket , shouting angrily for them to get their damn mules and shitboxes out of the way . And leaving one hand inside his jacket . Guiliano jumped off the cart . He did n't bother to get his luparaout of the wagon nor did he bother to draw the pistol in his belt . He gave a signal to his men waiting in the underbrush and they ran onto the road holding their weapons . Terranova split off to walk to the rearmost truck so that it could not be moved . Pisciotta slid down the embankment and confronted the raging Roman truck driver . Meanwhile Passatempo , more excitable than the others , yanked the first trucker out of his vehicle and threw him on the road at Guiliano @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up . By that time , Pisciotta had herded the driver of the rear truck up to join the other two . The Roman had withdrawn his empty hand from his jacket and erased the anger from his face . Guiliano smiled with genuine good will and said , " This is a fortunate day for the three of you . You wo n't have to make the long trip to Palermo . My carters will unload the trucks and distributethe food to the needy of this district , under my supervision of course . Allow me to introduce myself . I am Guiliano . " The three drivers immediately became apologetic and affable . They were in no hurry , they said . They had all the time in the world . In fact , it was time for their lunch . Their trucks were comfortable . The weather was not too warm . Indeed , it was a happy chance , a stroke of fortune. 152 153MARIO PuzoGuiliano saw their fear . " Do n't worry , " he said . " I do n't kill men who earn bread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me for lunch while my people do their work , and then you will go home to your wives and children and tell them of your good fortune . When the police question you , help them as little as possible and you will earn my gratitude . " Guiliano paused . It was important to him that these men should feel no shame or hatred . It was important that they should report their good treatment . For there would be others . They let themselves be herded to the shade of a giant boulder by the side of the road . They voluntarily offered Guiliano their pistols without being searched . And they sat like angels as the carters unloaded their trucks . When the carters were finished , there was still one fully loaded truck whose contents could not fit into their wagons . Guiliano put Pisciotta and Passatempo into this vehicle with a driver and told Pisciotta to deliver food to the farm laborers of Montelepre . Guiliano himself and Terranova would supervise the distribution of the food in the district of Castelvetrano and the town of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Monte d'Ora . With this one deed Guiliano was on the road to winning the support of the whole countryside . What other bandit had given his spoils to the poor ? The next day the newspapers all over Sicily had stories about the Robin Hood bandit . Only Passatempogrumbled that they had done a day 's work for nothing . Pisciotta and Terranova understood that their band had gained a thousand supporters against Rome . What they did not know was that the goods had been destined for the warehouse of Don Croce . IN ONLY a month Guiliano had informers everywhere  --  telling him what rich merchants traveled with black market money , the habits of certain noble persons and those few wicked people who gossiped with highly placed police officials . And so therumor came to Guiliano of the jewels that the Duchess of Alcamosometimes flaunted . It was said that for most of the year they were kept in a bank vault in Palermo but that she took them out on some occasions to wear to parties . To learn more about what he sensed might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alcamo estate . Twenty miles southwest of Montelepre , the estate of the Duke and Duchess of Alcamo was walled , its gates manned by armed guards . The Duke also paid " rent " to the Friends of the Friends , which guaranteed that his livestock would not be stolen , his house burglarized or any member of his family kidnapped . In ordinary times and with ordinary criminals this would have made him safer than the Pope in the Vatican . In early November the great estates of Sicily harvest their grapes , and to do so hire laborers from the nearby villages . Pisciotta reported to the town square and let himself be recruited for work on the Duke of Alcamo 's estate . He spent the first day in backbreaking labor , filling baskets with clusters of black purplefruit . There were more than a hundred people in the vineyard  --  men , women and small children who sang together as they worked . At midday , a huge lunch was served outdoors . Pisciotta sat alone , watching the others . He noticed one young woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She was pretty but pale ; obviously she rarely worked in the sun . Also she was better dressed than the other women . But what struck Pisciotta was the disdainful pout on her face , and the way she avoided all contact with the other workers . He learned that this girl was the personal maid of the Duchess . Pisciotta knew immediately that she would serve his purposes better than anyone else . Guiliano , who knew Pisciotta 's ways , had ordered him strictly not to shame any of the local girls in the process of getting information ; but Pisciotta considered Turi too much a romantic and too innocent in the ways of the world . The prize was too rich , the girl too pretty . When she came out with another huge tray of bread , he liftedM A R I O P U Z OTHE S I C I L I A Nit out of her hands and carried it for her . She was startled , and when he asked her name , she refused to answer . Pisciotta put down the tray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ferocious smile . " When I ask you a question , answer me . If you do n't , I 'll bury you in that mountain of grapes . " And then he laughed to show he was joking . He gave her his most charming smile , spoke in his gentlest voice . " You 're the most beautiful girl I 've seen in Sicily , " he said . " I had to speak to you . " The maid was both terrified and enticed by him . She noted the dangerous cutting knife dangling from his waist , the way he carried himself , as if he too were a duke . Now she was interested . She told him her name was Graziella . When the workday was finished Pisciotta boldly knocked at the back kitchen of the castle and asked for Graziella . The old woman who opened the door listened to him , then said curtly , " The servants are not allowed to receive visitors . " She slammed the door in his face . The next day Pisciotta took the tray Graziella @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see her after work . He slipped a little gold bracelet over her wrist as he caressed her arm . She promised she would slip out after dark and meet him in the empty vineyard . That night Aspanu Pisciotta wore the special silk shirt tailored for him in Palermo . He waited for her in a valley formed by mountains of cut grapes on every side . When Graziella came to him he embraced her , and when she lifted her mouth to be kissed he brushed her lips with his and put his hand between her legs at the same time . She tried to twist away but he gripped her firmly . They kissed more deeply and he lifted her woolen skirt , surprised to find that she was wearing silken undergarments . She must have borrowed them from the Duchess , Pisciotta thought . She was a bold little piece , and a bit of a thief . He pulled her down to the blanket he had spread on the ground . They lay there together . She was kissing him passionatelyand he could feel her response @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulled them down and the warm wet flesh was in his hands . She was unbuckling his belt and as they continued to kiss he pushed his trousers down to his ankles . He rolled over on top of her , took his hand away , and then thrust inside her . Graziella gave a little moan and bucked upward with astonishing strength and Aspanu Pisciotta felt himself rising and falling , rising and falling , and then suddenly Graziella gave a little shriek and lay still . Damn , Pisciotta thought , she was too quick . But it was just as well . His main purpose was information , his own satisfaction could wait . They wrapped themselves in the blanket and hugged each other . He told her that he was working to earn some money to enter the University of Palermo , that his family wanted him to be a lawyer . He wanted her to think he was a good catch . Then he asked her about herself , how she liked her work , what kind of people were her fellow servants ? Gradually he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Graziella put Aspanu 's hand back between her legs and then told him how beautiful the Duchess looked dressed in her fine clothes and jewelry , and how she , Graziella , was a favorite and was allowed to wear the out-of-fashion frocks the Duchess discarded. " 1 would like to see you in your mistress 's finery . Does she let you try on her jewels , too ? " " Well , on Christmas Eve she always lets me wear a necklace for the evening . " So as Guiliano had guessed , the jewels would be in the house for the holiday season . He needed to find out one more thing , but suddenly she was straddling him , trying to keep the blanket over her shoulders . Aspanu was fully aroused , the blanket fell away , the skirt flew over Graziella 's head and the force of their thrusts carried them into the wall of grapes . When they were done , their exhausted bodies were covered with the sticky juice of the fruit and of their own bodies . Aspanu said , " Fresh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come into the house and make love to you properly ? " " Not while the Duke is here . When he goes on his trips toMARIO PUZOPalermo , the household is more lax . Next month , he will go away for several weeks , just before Christmas . " Aspanu smiled . And now that he had all the information he needed , he paid full attention to the job at hand . He pounced on Graziella 's body and pinned her again to the blanket , making love with a ferocity that made the girl helpless with pleasure , and frightened her a little . Just enough that she would want more of him in the month ahead . FIVE DAYS before Christmas , Guiliano , Passatempo , Pisciotta , and Terranova pulled up before the gates of the Alcamo Estate in a wagon drawn by mules . They were dressed in the hunting garb of well-to-do peasant landowners , bought in Palermo with the spoils of their truck raid : corduroy trousers , red woolen shirts , heavy shooting jackets that held boxes of bullets . Two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daylight they were not alert and kept their weapons on their shoulders . Guiliano strode toward them briskly . He was unarmed except for the pistol hidden beneath his rough carter 's coat . He smiled at them broadly . " Gentlemen , " he said . " My name is Guiliano and I 've come to wish your charming Duchess a good Christmas and beg for alms to help the poor . " The guards were frozen with astonishment when they heard the name Guiliano . Then they started to swing their guns loose . But by that time Passatempo and Terranova had them covered with machine pistols . Pisciotta relieved the guards of their guns and threw the weapons into the wagon . Passatempo and Terra- nova were left to stroll with the guards in front of the gates . The approach to the mansion consisted of an enormous stone courtyard . In one corner a group of chickens fluttered around an old woman servant scattering grain . Beyond the manor house , the four children of the Duchess were playing in a gar- den , supervised by governesses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ path to the house , Pisciotta beside him . HisTHE S I C I L I A Ninformation was correct , there were no other guards . Beyond the garden was a far larger piece of land , which served to grow vegetables and held a grove of olive trees . In this field six laborerstoiled . He rang the bell and then pushed the door just as the maid was opening it . Graziella was startled by Pisciotta 's appearanceat the front door and stepped aside . Guiliano said gently , " Do n't be alarmed . Tell your mistress we are sent here by the Duke on business . 1 must speak to her . " Still puzzled , Graziella led them into the drawing room where the Duchess was reading . The Duchess waved the maid from the room , annoyed by the unannounced intrusion and said sharply , " My husband is away . Can I help you ? " Guiliano could not answer her . He was stunned by the beauty of the room . It was the largest he had ever seen and , more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drapes guarded the huge French windows , the ceiling above was hollowedto a dome and decorated with frescoes of cherubim . Books were everywhere  --  on the sofa , the coffee tables and in special cases along the walls . Great massive paintings in rich oils hung on the walls and huge vases of flowers were every place . Silver and gold boxes were scattered on tables that kneeled before massive stuffed chairs and sofas . The room could hold a hundred people easily and the only person using it was this solitary woman dressed in white silk . Sunlight and air and the shouts of the children playing in the garden came through the open windows . For the first time Guiliano understood the seductivenessof wealth , that money could create such beauty , and he was reluctant to mar that beauty by any crassness or cruelty . He would do what he must do and not leave a scar on this lovely scene . The Duchess , waiting patiently for an answer , was struck by this young man 's handsome virility . She saw he was impressed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little annoyed that he did not notice her own beauty . She thought it was too bad he was so obviously a peasant and did not move in her circles , MARIO PUZOwhere a little innocent flirtatiousness would not have been inappropriate . All this made her say more charmingly than she ordinarily would , " Young man , I 'm so sorry , but if it 's business about the estate you will have to come back another time . My husband is not at home . " Guiliano looked at her . He felt that flush of antagonism a poor man feels for a rich woman who is in some way asserting her superiority to him because of her wealth and social position . He bowed politely , noticing the spectacular ring on her finger , and said with an ironic submissiveness , " My business is with you . My name is Guiliano . " But the irony of his submissiveness was wasted on the Duchess , who was too accustomed to the slavishness of her servants . She took it as a matter of course . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and took no interest in the daily affairs of Sicily . She rarely read the local newspapers ; she consideredthem barbarous . So she only said courteously , " I am pleased to make your acquaintance . Have we met in Palermo ? At the opera perhaps ? " Aspanu Pisciotta , who had been observing the scene with amusement , laughed openly and strolled over to the French windowsso as to intercept any servant who might come from that direction . Guiliano , a little angered by Pisciotta 's laughter but charmed by the Duchess 's ignorance , said firmly , " My dear Duchess , we have never met . I am a bandit . My full name is Salvatore Guiliano . I think of myself as the Champion of Sicily , and my purpose in coming to see you today is to ask you to donate your jewelry to the poor so that they may enjoy and celebrate the birth of Christ on Christmas day . " The Duchess smiled unbelievingly . This young boy whose face and body aroused an unfamiliar hunger in her could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of danger she was positively intrigued . She would tell this story at the parties in Palermo . So she said with an innocent smile , " My jewels are16oTHE S I C I L I A Nin the bank vaults in Palermo . Whatever cash is in the house you may have . With my blessing . " No one had ever doubted her word in her whole life . Even as a little girl she had never lied . This was the first time . Guiliano looked at the diamond pendant around her throat . He knew she was lying , but he was reluctant to do what he must do . Then he nodded to Pisciotta , who put his fingers between his teeth and whistled three times . In just a few minutes Passatempoappeared at the French windows . His short , squat ugly figure , his evil scarred face could have come out of the puppet shows . His face was broad with hardly any forehead , and his thick bushy black hair and bulging eyebrows made him look like a gorilla . He smiled at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the third bandit finally frightened the Duchess . She undid her necklace and handed it over to Guiliano . " Will that satisfy you ? " she said . " No , " Guiliano said . " My dear Duchess , I 'm a soft-hearted man . But my colleagues are different propositions altogether . My friend Aspanu , though handsome , is as cruel as that little mustache he wears that breaks so many hearts . - And the man at the window , though he is my subordinate , gives me nightmares . Do n't make me unleash them . They will sweep into your garden like hawks and carry your children away into the mountains . Now bring me the rest of your diamonds . " The Duchess fled into her bedroom and returned in a few minutes with a box of jewelry . She had been quick-witted enough to hide a few valuable pieces before she brought it out . She gave the box to Guiliano . He thanked her graciously . Then he turned to Pisciotta . " Aspanu , " he said , " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a look in the bedroom just to be certain . " Pisciotta found the hidden jewels almost immediatelyand brought them to Guiliano . Guiliano meanwhile had opened the jewelry box and his heart jumped with elation at the sight of the precious gems . He knew161M A R I O P U Z Othe contents of this box would feed the entire city of Montelepre for months . And it was a greater source of joy that they had been bought by the Duke with the money sweated from the hides of his laborers . Then as the Duchess was wringing her hands he noticed again the huge emerald on her finger . " My dear Duchess , " he said , " how could you be so foolish as to try to cheat me by hiding those other pieces ? I would have expected that from some miserly peasant who slaved for his treasure . But how could you risk your life and those of your children for two pieces of jewelry that you would no more miss than your husband the Duke would miss the hat on his head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you wear on your finger . " The Duchess was in tears . " My dear young man , " she said , " please let me keep this ring . I will send you its value in money . But my husband gave it to me as an engagement gift . I could not bear to be without it . It would break my heart . " Again Pisciotta laughed . He did so deliberately . He was afraid that Turi would let her keep the ring out of the sentimentality of his own heart . And the emerald was obviously of the highest value . But Guiliano had no such sentimentality . Pisciotta would al- ways remember the look in his eye when Turi took the Duch- ess 's arm roughly and pulled the emerald ring off her trembling hand . He stepped back quickly and then he put the ring on the little finger of his left hand . Turi saw the Duchess was blushing and there were tears in her eyes . His manner was once again courtly when he said , " In honor of your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wear it myself . " The Duchess searched his face for a look of irony , but there was none . But it was a magic moment for Turi Guiliano . For when he slipped it on his finger , he felt the transference of power . With this ring he wedded himself to his destiny . It was the symbol of the power he would win from the world of the rich . In that poolTHE S I C I L I A Nof dark green , bounded by its circle of gold , still smelling of the perfume of a beautiful woman who had worn it without ceasing for many years , he had captured a tiny essence of life that could never be his . DON CROCE listened without saying a word . The Duke of Alcamo was making his complaint to Don Croce in person . Had he not paid his " rent " to the Friends of the Friends ? Had they not guaranteed his immunity against all forms of theft ? What were things coming to ? In the old days nobody would have dared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jewelry ? The Duke had reported the theft to the authorities , though this was futile he knew and might displease Don Croce . But there was some insurance to be collected ; perhaps the government in Rome would take this bandit Guiliano seriously . Don Croce reflected that it was time to take him very seriously indeed . He said to the Duke , " If I recovered your jewelry would you pay a quarter of their value ? " The Duke was furious . " First I pay you the rent to keep me and my possessions safe . Then , when you fail in your duty , you ask me to pay ransom . How can you hope to keep the respect of your clients if you do business in this way ? " Don Croce nodded . " I must admit you speak with reason . But think of Salvatore Guiliano as a force of nature , as a scourge of God . Surely you can not expect the Friends of the Friends to guard you against earthquakes , volcanoes , floods ? In time Guilianowill be controlled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ransom I will arrange . You will have your protection without paying my usual rent for the next five years , and under the agreement Guiliano will not strike again . And why should he , since I and he presume you will have the good sense to keep these valuables in the bank vaults of Palermo ? Women are too innocent  --  they do not know the lust and greed with which menM A R I O P U Z Opursue the material goods of this world . " He paused for a moment to allow the slight smile that had appeared on the Duke 's face to disappear . Then he said , " If you calculate the rent to pay for the protection of your whole estate for five years in the troubled times ahead , you will see that you have lost very little by this misfortune . " The Duke did think it over . Don Croce was quite right about the hard times that lay ahead . He would lose more than a little by ransoming the jewels , despite the remission of five years ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Croce would be alive for another five years or that he could contain Guiliano ? But still it was the best bargain to be made . It would prevent the Duchess from wheedling more jewelry out of him in the years to come and that would be an enormous savings . He would have to sell another piece of land , but his ancestors had been doing that for generations to pay for their follies , and he still had thousands of acres left . The Duke agreed . DON CROCE summoned He was absolutely straightforward . " You wo n't get a better price even if you sell the jewelry to thieves in Palermo , " he said . " And even then it will take time and you certainly wo n't get the money before Christmas , which I know is your wish . And beyondthat you will earn the good will of Don Croce which it is important for you to have . You have , after all , caused him a loss of respect , which he will forgive if you do him this favor . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Don Croce 's good will ; after all , one of his dreams was to slay the dragon of the Mafia in Sicily . But he had already sent emissaries to Palermo to find buyers for the stolen jewelry , and it was clear that it would be a long and torturous process . So he agreed to the bargain . But he refused to give up the emerald ring . Before Adonis left he abandoned finally his role as a teacherTHE S I C I L I A Nof romances to Guiliano . For the first time he spoke to him of the realities of Sicilian life . " My dear godson , " he said , " no one admires your qualities more than I do . I love your high-mindedness , which I hope I helped instill in you . But now we must speak of survival . You can never hope to win against the Friends of the Friends . For the last thousand years , like a million spiders , they have spun a gigantic web over all of life in Sicily . Don Croce now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , he wants your friendship , he wants you to grow rich with him . But you must bend sometimes to his will . You can have your empire , but it must exist within his web . One thing is certain  --  you cannotdirectly oppose him . If you do so , history itself will help Don Croce destroy you . " AND SO the jewelry was returned to the Duke . Guiliano kept half the money from the jewelry to be distributed among Pisciotta , Passatempo and Terranova . They eyed the emerald ring on Guiliano 's finger but said nothing , for Guiliano refused to take any of the money from the sale of the jewels . The other half of the money Guiliano was determined to distributeamong the poor shepherds who guarded the flocks of sheep and cattle that belonged to the rich , the old widows and orphan children , all the poor around him . He gave out most of the money through intermediaries , but one fine day he filled the pockets of his sheepskin jacket with packets of lire notes . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walk through the villages between Montelepre and Piani dei Greci with Terranova at his side . In one village there were three old women who were almost starving . He gave each of them a packet of lire . They wept and kissed his hands . In another village was a man who was about to lose his farm and land because he could not make the mortgagepayments . Guiliano left him enough to pay off the mortgage in full. 164 1 165M A R I O P U Z OIn another village he took over the local bakery and grocery store , paying the owner for the goods , and distributed bread and cheese and pasta to all the village people . In the next town he gave money to the parents of a sick child so they could take him to the hospital in Palermo and pay for the visits of the local doctor . He also attended the wedding of a young couple and gave them a generous dowry . But what he loved most was to give money to the ragged young children who thronged the streets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them knew Guiliano . They gathered around him as he distributed the packets of money telling them to bring it to their parents . Guiliano watched them as they joyfully ran to their homes . He only had a few packets of money left when he decided to visit his mother before nightfall . Crossing a field behind his home he encountered a little boy and a little girl who were crying . They had lost money entrusted to them by their parents and said the carabinieri had taken it from them . Guiliano was amused by this little tragedy and gave them one of the two packets of money he had left . And then , because the little girl was so pretty and he could n't bear to think of her being punished , he gave her a note for her parents . The little girl 's parents were not the only ones who were grateful . The people in the towns of Borgetto , Corleone , Partinico , Monreale , and Piani dei Greci began to call him the " King of Montelepre " to show their loyalty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five years ' " rent " from the Duke . For though Don Croce had told Adonis that the Duke would pay only twenty percent of the value of the jewels , he had collected twenty-five percent from the Duke , and put five percent in his pocket . What delighted him even more was his satisfaction that he had spotted Guiliano so early and judged him so accurately . What a166THE SICILIANfine upstanding lad . Who could believe that one so young could see so clearly , act so wisely , listen so temperately to older and wiser heads ? And yet all this with a cool intelligence that guarded his own interests , which of course the Don admired , for who would wish to associate himself with a fool ? Yes , the Don thought Turi Guiliano would be his strong right arm . And with time , a beloved titular son . TURI GUILIANO saw clearly through all these machinations around him . He knew his godfather was sincerely concerned about his welfare . But that did not mean he trusted the older man 's judgment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Friends of the Friends ; indeed he needed their help . But he was under no illusions about the long run . Eventually , if he listened to his godfather , he would have to become a vassal to Don Croce . This he was determined he would never do . For now , he must bide his time. 167THE S I C I L I A NCHAP'T'ER11GUILIANO 'S BAND now numbered thirty men . Some of these were former members of the Passatempo and Terranova bands . Some were citizens of Montelepre who had been freed from prison by Guiliano 's raid . They had found there was to be no forgiveness by the authorities despite their innocence ; they were still being hunted . They decided to be hunted with Guiliano rather than be tracked down alone and friendless . One fine April morning Guiliano 's informants in Montelepre sent word that a dangerous-looking man , perhaps a police spy , was making inquiries about joining the band . He was waiting in the central square . Guiliano sent Terranova and four men into Montelepre to investigate . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; if he was someone of use , they would recruit him . Early in the afternoon , Terranova returned and told Guiliano , " We have the fellow and before we shoot him , we thought you might like to make his acquaintance . " Guiliano laughed when he saw the burly figure dressed in the traditional peasant Sicilian working garb . " Well , old friend , did you think I could ever forget your face . Have you come with better bullets this time ? " It was the Corporal of the carabinieri , Canio Silvestro , who had fired his pistol at Guiliano 's head during the famous jailbreak. 168Silvestro 's strong scarred face was intent . The face appealed to Guiliano for some reason . He had a soft spot in his heart for this man who had helped him prove his immortality . Silvestro said , " I 've come to join up . I can be invaluable to you . " He said this proudly as one who is about to make a gift . This also pleased Guiliano . He let Silvestro tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Corporal Silvestro had been sent to Palermo to face a court-martial for dereliction of duty . His Maresciallohad been furious with him and had interrogated him closely before recommending prosecution . Oddly enough the one circumstance that inflamed the Maresciallo 's suspicions was the Corporal 's attempted shooting of Guiliano . The cause of the misfire had been found to be defective ammunition . The Marescialloclaimed that the Corporal had loaded his gun with that one harmless bullet knowing it was defective . That the whole attempted resistance had been a charade and that Corporal Silvestrohad helped Guiliano plan the jailbreak and stationed his guards to help the raid succeed . Guiliano interrupted . " How did they think you could have known the bullets were defective ? " Silvestro looked sheepish . " I should have known . I was the armorer in the infantry , an expert . " His face became grim and he shrugged . " I had a lapse , true . They made me a desk man and I did n't pay too much attention to my real business . But I can be valuable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can check all your weapons and repair them . I can make sure your ammunitionis properly handled so that your supply dumps do n't blow up . I can modify your weapons so that they will suit the use you put them to , here in the mountains . " " Tell me the rest of your story , " Guiliano said . He was studyingthe man closely . This could be a plan to infiltrate his band with an informer . He could see that Pisciotta , Passatempo and Terranova were full of distrust . Silvestro went on . " They were all fools and they were all frightened women . The Maresciallo knew that it was stupid of169MARIO PUZOhim to take most of the men into the mountains when we had a barracks full of prisoners . The carabinieri regard Sicily as some foreign occupied country . I used to protest against that attitude , and that got me into their bad books . And the authorities in Palermo wanted to protect their Maresciallo  --  they were responsiblefor him after all . It would look better if the Bellampo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men who were braver and more clever . They did n't courtmartialme . They told me to resign . They said it would be withoutprejudice , but I know them better than that . I 'll never get a government job again . I 'm fitted for nothing else and I 'm a Sicilianpatriot . So I thought to myself  --  what can I do with my life ? And I said to myself  --  I will go to Guiliano . " Guiliano sent to the cooking site for food and drink and then conferred with his chiefs . Passatempo was gruff and positive . " What kind of fools do they think we are ? Shoot him and throw his body off the cliff . We do n't need carabinieri in our band . " Pisciotta saw that Guiliano was once again taken by the Corporal . He knew his friend 's impulsive emotions , so he said carefully , " It 's most likely a trick . But even if it 's not , why take the chance ? We 'll have to worry all the time . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back ? " Terranova said , " He knows our camp . He 's seen some of our men and he knows their number . That is valuable information . " Guiliano said , " He 's a true Sicilian . He acts out of a sense of honor . I ca n't believe he would act the part of a spy . " He saw that they all smiled at his innocence . Pisciotta said , " Remember , he tried to kill you . He had a concealed weapon and he was a prisoner and he tried to kill you out of sheer temper and with no hope of escape . " Guiliano thought , And that 's what makes him valuable to me . Aloud he said , " Does n't that prove he is a man of honor ? He was defeated but felt that he had to die avenging himself . And what harm can he do ? He 'll be a member of the common hand170THE S I C I L I A N  --  we wo n't take him into our confidence . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' 11 give him my personal attention . When the time is ripe we 'll put him to a test that he must refuse if he is a spy for the carabinieri . Leave him to me . " Later that evening when he told Silvestro that he was now a member of the band , the man simply said , " You can count on me for anything . " He understood that Guiliano had again saved him from death . AT EASTERTIME Guiliano visited his family . Pisciotta had arguedagainst this , saying the police might set a trap . Easter in Sicily had always been a traditional death day for bandits . The police counted on the deep ties of family to bring outlaws sneakingdown from the mountains to visit their loved ones . But Guiliano'sspies brought word that the Maresciallo himself would be visiting his family on the mainland and that half the garrison at the Bellampo Barracks had been given leave to celebrate the holiday in Palermo . Guiliano decided that he would bring enough men with him to make it safe . He slipped into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visit a few days before and his mother had prepared a feast . That night he slept in his childhood bed , and the next day , when his mother went to morning Mass , Guilianoaccompanied her to church . He had a bodyguard of six men who were also visiting their families in the town but had orders to accompany Guiliano wherever he went . As he came out of the church with his mother , his six bodyguardswere waiting for him with Pisciotta . Aspanu 's face was white with fury as he said , " You have been betrayed Turi . The Maresciallo has returned from Palermo with twenty extra men to arrest you . They have your mother 's house surrounded . They think you 're inside . " Guiliano felt for one moment a kind of anger at his own rashnessand stupidity and resolved he would never be so careless1 7 1M A R I O P U Z O THE S I C I L I A Nagain . Not that the Maresciallo with his twenty men could have captured him even in his mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and there would have been a bloody battle . But that would have spoiled the spirit of his Easter homecoming . The day Christ had risen was not the day to break the peace . He kissed his mother goodbye and told her to return home and freely admit to the police that she had left him at the church . In that way she could not be charged with any conspiracy . He told her not to worry , that he and his men were heavily armed and would easily escape ; there would not even be any fighting . The carabinieri would not dare to follow them into the mountains . Guiliano and his men left without even being sighted by the police . That night in the mountain camp , Guiliano questioned Pisciotta . How could the Maresciallo have known about the visit ? Who was the informer ? Everything must be done to find out . " That will be your special task , Aspanu , " he said . " And if there is one , there may be others . I do n't care how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you must find out . " EVEN AS a child , Pisciotta had never liked the buffoonish barber of Montelepre . Frisella was one of those barbers who cut hair to suit his mood of the day , one time modishly , another time puckishly , another time with the extreme conservativeness of a peasantfarmer . By varying his style he put forward his claim to being an artist . He was also too familiar with his superiors and too patronizing to his equals . With children he was playful in that particularly spiteful Sicilian style which is one of the less pleasantsides of the island character ; he would nip their ears with his scissors and sometimes cut their hair so short that their heads looked like billiard balls . So it was with grim satisfaction that Pisciotta reported to Guiliano that Frisella the barber was the police spy and had broken the sacred code of omerta . It was obvious that the Maresciallo was not making a random strike172that Easter day . He must have received information that Turi would be there . And how could he have gotten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only twenty-four hours before ? Pisciotta used his own informers in the village to check on every step the Maresciallo had taken during that twenty-four hours . And since only Guiliano 's mother and father had known about the visit , he questioned them casually to see if they might have accidentally given anything away . Maria Lombardo soon smelled out his intention . She said to him , " I spoke to no one , not even my neighbors . I stayed in the house and cooked so that Turi would have an Easter feast . " But Guiliano 's father had gone to the barber Frisella on the morning of his son 's visit . The old man was a little vain , and he wanted to look his best on the rare occasions when his son Turi came to visit at the house in Montelepre . Frisella had shaved and barbered the old man and made his usual jokes . " Was Signorperhaps going into Palermo to visit certain young ladies there ? Was he receiving important visitors from Rome ? " He , Frisella , would make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " And Pisciotta visualized the setting . Guiliano'sfather with a little secretive smile on his face as he grumbledthat a man could look like a gentleman for no reason except his own satisfaction . And yet the swelling of importance at knowing his son was famous enough to be called the " King of Montelepre . " Perhaps the old man had come in on other occasionsand the barber had learned that Guiliano visited the same day and so put two and two together . Maresciallo Roccofino dropped into the barbershop every morning for his daily shave . There did not seem to be any conversation that could convey information from the barber to the policeman . But Pisciotta was certain . He sent spies to the barbershopto lounge around all day and play cards with Frisella at the little table he kept out on the street . They drank wine , talked politics and shouted insults at friends who passed by . Over the weeks Pisciotta 's spies gathered more information. ' 73MARIO PtzO THE SICILIANFrisella always whistled the tune of one of his favorite opera arias when he shaved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with recordings from Rome . This would always be the case when he attended the Maresciallo . And there would always be a time when he leaned over the police officer and whispered something . If you were not suspiciousit was only a barber being deferential to the wishes of his customer 's pleasure . But then one of Pisciotta 's spies got a look at the lire note the Maresciallo used to pay for his service . They noticed it was folded , and the barber put it in a special watch fob pocket in his vest , underneath his white coat . When the spy and one of his helpers confronted Frisella and forced him to show the note , it was of ten thousand lire denomination . The barber swore it was for his services over the past few months , and the spies pretended to believe him . Pisciotta gave his evidence to Guiliano in the presence of Terranova , Passatempo and Corporal Silvestro . They were in their camp in the mountains , and Guiliano went to the edge of one of the cliffs that overlooked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the barber , had been a part of that town ever since Guiliano could remember . As a little boy he had gone to Frisella to have his hair cut for Holy Confirmation , and Frisella had given him a small silver coin as a gift . He knew Frisella 's wife and son . Frisella had shouted jokes to him in the street and always asked after his mother and father . But now Frisella had broken the sacred law of omerta . He had sold secrets to the enemy ; he was a paid informant of the police . How could he have been so foolish ? And what was he , Guiliano , to do with him now ? It was one thing to kill the field police in hot combat , it was another thing to execute , in cold blood , an avuncular older man . Turi Guiliano was only twenty-one years of age and this was the first time he had to use the cold cruelty so necessary in great endeavors . He turned back to the others . " Frisella has known me all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a child , do you remember , Aspanu ? And maybe he just gossips with the Maresciallo , does n't really give him information . It 's not as if we told him I was coming to town and then he told the police . Maybe he just gives theories and accepts the money because it is offered . Who would refuse ? " Passatempo was looking at Guiliano with narrowed eyes , as a hyena would regard the body of a dying lion , wondering if the time was ripe and safe to dash in and tear off a piece of flesh . Terranova shook his head slightly , a smile on his lips as if he were listening to a child tell some foolish story . But only Pisciottaanswered him . " He 's as guilty as a priest in a whorehouse , " Pisciotta said . " We could give him a warning , " Guiliano said . " We could bring him over to our side and use him to give false information to the authorities when it suits our purpose . " Even as he spoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer afford such gestures . Pisciotta said wrathfully , " Why not give him a present , a sack of grain or a chicken while you 're at it ? Turi , our lives and the lives of all the men out there in the mountains depend on your courage , on your will , on your leadership . How can we follow if you forgive a traitor like Frisella ? A man who breaks the law of omerta . The Friends of the Friends would have his liver and heart hanging from the barber pole by this time and on less evidence . If you let him go then every greedy traitor will know he can inform once without punishment . One of those onces ' could be our death . " Terranova spoke judiciously . " Frisella is a stupid buffoon , a greedy and treacherous man . In ordinary times he would only he the village nuisance . Now he is dangerous . To let him off would be foolhardy  --  he is not intelligent enough to mend his ways . He would think we are not serious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have suppressed the activities of the friends of the Friends in the town of Montelepre . Their man Quintana moves very cautiously , though he makes some impru-174 175dent statements . If you let Frisella off with anything less than death , the Friends would think you weak and test you further . The carahinieri would become bolder , less afraid , more dangerous . Even the citizens of Montelepre would think less of you . Frisella can not live . " He said this last almost with regret . Guiliano listened to them thoughtfully . They were right . He was conscious of Passatempo 's look and read to the man 's heart . Passatempo could never be trusted if Frisella lived . There was no going back to being one of Charlemagne 's knights , there was no going back to resolving differences in honorable combat on the Fields of the Cloths of Gold . Frisella would have to be executed and in such a way as to achieve maximum terror . Guiliano had an idea . He turned to Corporal Silvestro and asked , " What do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his informants . Is the barber guilty ? " Silvestro shrugged , his face impassive . He did not speak . They all recognized that it was a point of honor for him not to speak , not to betray his former trust . That his not answering was his way of telling them that the barber certainly had some contact with the Maresciallo . Still Guiliano had to be sure . He smiled at the Corporal and said , " Now is the time to prove your loyalty to us . We will all go to Montelepre together and you will personally execute the barber in the public square . " Aspanu Pisciotta marveled at his friend 's cunning . Guiliano had always surprised him . He had always acted nobly and yet he could plant a trap worthy of lago . They had all come to know the Corporal as a truthful and honest man with a sense of fair play . He would never consent to perform the execution if he was not sure the barber was guilty , no matter what the cost to him . Pisciotta @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Corporal refused , the barber would be judged innocentand go free . But the Corporal stroked his bushy mustache and looked them all in the eye . He said , " Frisella cuts hair so badly he deserves to die for that alone . I 'll be ready in the morning . " At dawn Guiliano and Pisciotta and ex-Corporal Silvestro took the road down to Montelepre . An hour before them Passatempohad left with a squad of ten men to seal off all streets emptying into the central square of the town . Terranova was left in charge of the camp and prepared to lead a strong band into the town if they ran into serious trouble . It was still early morning when Guiliano and Pisciotta entered the town square . The cobbled streets and narrow sidewalks had been flushed with water and some children were playing around the raised platform where the donkey and mare had been mated on that long-ago fateful day . Guiliano told Silvestro to chase the children out of the square so they could not witness what was about to happen . Silvestro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chickens . When Guiliano and Pisciotta entered the barbershop with machinepistols at the ready , Frisella was cutting the hair of a wealthy landowner of the province . The barber assumed they had come to kidnap his customer and he whipped off the cloth with a cunning smile as if to present a prize . The landowner , an old Sicilian peasant who had grown rich during the war by sellinglivestock to the Italian Army , stood up proudly . But Pisciottamotioned him to one side and said with a grin , " You do n't have enough money to pay our price and for us to take the trouble . " Guiliano was extremely alert and kept his eyes on Frisella . The barber was still holding his scissors . " Put them down , " he said . " You wo n't need to cut hair where you 're going . Now get outside . " Frisella dropped the scissors and turned his wide buffoon 's face into a clown 's grimace as he attempted to smile . " Turi , " he said , " I have no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm a poor man . Pisciotta grabbed him by his full bushy hair and dragged him out of the shop and into the cobblestoned street where Silvestro was waiting . Frisella fell on his knees and began to scream . M A R I O P U Z O " Turi , Turi , I cut your hair when you were a child . Do n't you remember . My wife will starve . My son is weak in the head . " Pisciotta could see Guiliano wavering . He kicked the barber and said , " You should have thought of those things when you informed . " Frisella began to weep . " I never informed on Turi . I told the Maresciallo about some sheep stealers . I swear on my wife and child . " Guiliano looked down at the man . At that moment he felt that his heart would break , that what he was about to do would destroy him forever . But he said gently , " You have a minute to make your peace with God . " Frisella looked up at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He bowed his head and murmured a prayer . Then looked up and said to Guiliano , " Do n't let my wife and child starve . " " I promise you they will have bread , " Guiliano said . He turned to Silvestro . " Kill him , " he said . The Corporal had watched the scene in a daze . But at these words he triggered his machine pistol . The bullets lifted Frisella'sbody and sent it skittering across the wet cobblestones . Blood darkened the little pools of water between the cracks . Blood ran black over the cracks the water had not reached and flushed out little lizards . There was a long moment of hushed silence in the square . Then Pisciotta knelt over the body and pinned a white square of paper on the dead man 's chest . When the Maresciallo arrived that was all he found as evidence . The shopkeepers had seen nothing , they claimed . They had been working in the rear of the store . Or they had been studying the beautiful clouds over Monte d'Ora . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the basin when he heard the shots , he had never seen the murderers . But despite all this it was clear who was guilty . The square paper on Frisella'sbody read , SO DIE ALL WHO BETRAY GUILIANO. 178CHAPTER12THE WAR was now over but Guiliano 's had just begun . In the course of two years , Salvatore Guiliano had become the most famous man in Sicily . He built up his domination of the northwestcorner of the island . At the heart of his empire was the town of Montelepre . He controlled the towns of Piani dei Greci , Borgetto and Partinico . And the murderous town of Corleone , whose inhabitants were so ferocious they were notorious even in Sicily . He ranged just short of Trapani , and he threatened the town of Monreale and the capital of Sicily itself , Palermo . When the new democratic government in Rome put a price of ten million lire on his head , Guiliano laughed and continued to move confidently through many of the towns . He even dined occasionally in the restaurants of Palermo . At the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the plate which read , " This is to show that Turi Guiliano can go wherever he likes . " Guiliano 's impregnable fortress was the vast galleries of the Cammarata Mountains . He knew all the caves and all the secret paths . He felt invincible here . He loved the view of Montelepre below him , the Partinico plain that stretched away to Trapani and the Mediterranean Sea . As twilight became blue , reflecting the faraway sea , he could see the ruined Greek temples , the orange groves , the olive orchards and the grain-filled fields that were Western Sicily . With his binoculars he could see the padlockedroadside shrines holding their dusty saints inside.
