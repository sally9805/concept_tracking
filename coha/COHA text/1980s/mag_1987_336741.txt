The co-producer of Flashdance , Top Gun and Beverly Hills Cop knew he " had a tendency to gain weight " after each movie . Still , the string of megahits had only managed to push the scale up to 199 lbs. , not too far out of line , he thought , with the standardized chart readings for a 5-ft. 9-in. 40-year-old male . But Simpson got a rude shock when the spa analysis revealed what proportion of his weight was muscle and what fat . A puffy 31% was fat , a figure well above the levels judged acceptable by physiologists . " I freaked out , " Simpson recalls . " I did n't realize I was that out of shape . " <P> Now , after a year of intensive exercise and fastidious dieting , he is down to a sleek 155 lbs . Even better , he has trimmed his body fat to 10% . And he is intent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scrupulously checks his body-fat percentage every six weeks : " This is a life change for me . " <P> Step off the scales , America .

The most accurate and expensive method ( $40 to $100 a test ) is hydrostatic weighing , also known as the water- buoyancy test , in which a person sits on a special scale and is dunked into a vat of water . Because fat is lighter than water , a person weighs less underwater . The land and submerged weights are used to calculate body fat .

Electrodes are attached to hands and feet , and a small current is applied briefly . Readings measure the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to determine the percentage of fat . The simplest and least expensive technique is the skin-fold test , in which calipers are used to measure pinches of skin at various sites , including the abdomen , thighs and back .
