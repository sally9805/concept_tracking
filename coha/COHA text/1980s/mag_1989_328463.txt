T.E . LAWRENCE : THE SELECTED LETTERS <P> Edited by Malcolm Brown ; Norton ; 568 pages ; $27.50 <P> With hindsight , it is easy to see why a slim , self-effacing Englishman named Thomas Edward Lawrence became one of this century 's most ballyhooed celebrities . Out of the appalling carnage of World War I  --  the mud-caked anonymity of the trenches , the hail of mechanized death that spewed from machine guns and fell from airplanes  --  there emerged a lone Romantic , framed heroically against the clean desert sands of Arabia . U.S. journalist Lowell Thomas was the first to recognize that Lawrence 's wartime work  --  organizing disparate Arab tribes into armed revolt against the occupying Turks , allies of Germany  --  had pop-myth possibilities . Thomas ' publicity essentially created the figure known as Lawrence of Arabia , but others contributed to the saga . Robert Graves wrote a life of Lawrence that appeared in 1927 , when its subject was only 39 . Lawrence told his own story in Seven Pillars of Wisdom , which was published shortly after his death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Lawrence legend has thrived through a steady stream of biographies and memoirs . His life sparked one of the greatest epic films ever made : David Lean 's Lawrence of Arabia ( 1962 ) , recently rereleased in the original , uncut version its director intended . Moviegoers can once again admire Peter O'Toole in the title role and assume that they have seen Lawrence whole . They have not , through no fault of the actor or anyone else involved in that exemplary movie . On the evidence of The Selected Letters , which includes 470 examples , roughly two-thirds published for the first time , Lawrence was a host of different people subsumed under a name that was constantly subject to change . <P> After the war and the deluge of his fame , Lawrence stunned friends by changing his identity and going underground . As John Hume Ross , he enlisted in the Royal Air Force . When his cover was blown by a London newspaper ( ' UNCROWNED KING ' AS PRIVATE SOLDIER ) , Lawrence was forced out of the R.A.F. and subsequently enrolled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letter written soon after this move , he noted his divided state of mind and suggested that " perhaps there 's a solution to be found in multiple personality . " <P> Just so . In a single letter , Lawrence could ring all the changes between boasting and self-abnegation . To a confidante who had read an early version of Seven Pillars of Wisdom , Lawrence noted , " The story I have to tell is one of the most splendid ever given a man for writing . " He also downplayed his own participation in that story , adding , " I 've been &; am absurdly over-estimated . There are no supermen &; I 'm quite ordinary , &; will say so whatever the artistic results . In that point I 'm one of the few people who tell the truth about myself . "
