txt VENICE ON the lake in Rockaway Beach , Mo. , lies notified Mr. and Mrs. Master Elevator Co. of Chicago they have won a cottage site on the north shore of Lake Tanoycomo . Mr. and Mrs. Elevator Co. have to come up with $195 for closing costs , preparation of deed , past surveying , and that sort of stuff . To counteract the tension produced by weeks of political conventions , I am resorting today to our most dependable source of humor  --  the computers that address advertising mail . The pickings are so rich that , instead of a paragraph or two tucked down in the column , I can offer probably the most bollixed up address we 've seen . PIONEER GIRLS of Wheaton received a solicitation from Hill Brothers of Lynchburg , Va. , to buy shoes . The envelope was addressed to Mrs. Box 718 , c-o Pioneer Girl , Wheaton II . The letter begins : " THIS MAY BE THE LAST CHANCE FOR MRS . YZZ . " Then : " Dear Mrs. 788 : " This direct mail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which you must know unless you live in a cave . I receive five or six a week ' and have yet to get one that convinces me it was written to me and me only , even if they get the address and salutation right , personalized as a 's hamburger . Hill Brothers ' letter to Mrs. 788 , or Mrs. Yzz , is typical . The " personalized " line or words are always in heavier type or ink . " It is one of the most unusual offers that has ever been made in WHEATON or anywhere else in the State of ILLINOIS , " reads this letter . " FIRST OF ALL , it Is not open to everyone . The lady living next door to you at c-o PIONEER GIRL is probably NOT receiving it . " Direct mail is a legitimate and sometimes productive form of advertising , but junk like this is counterproductive . They 're trying to do better . I got a . computerized pitch from Ronald Reagan this week with everything spelled right . The computers know The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wolfe . After countless letters addressed " Dear Mr. Wolfe " they have switched tactics . " Dear Friend : " writes Reagan in his request for $15 , $25 , $50 , $100 , $250 , or " SOther . " Direct mall ( industry spokesmen asked please do n't say junk mail ) can be discarded easily . When they start with visible evidence to con you into thinking you are getting a personal letter , they 're asking to be pitched out . Comments on advertising are in order . Advertising has an enormous influence on the way we live . It dictates much'of what we see on television and hear on radio . It provides economic support for newspapers and magazines . IT IS IMPOSSIBLE In escape the onslaught of advertising . We can be selective regarding print advertising , reading what is attractive , informative , or entertaining , and ignoring the rest . It 's hard to escape the advertising on TV and radio . The advertising on TV is socially and economically more significant than the entertainment . Yet public evaluation of advertising is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business page columns such as that of George Lazarus . TV columnists write critiques of the fluff , but not of the substance of advertising . suggested that broadcast advertising is difficult to escape . But it can be done . I keep the radio on in my car , divided between AM and FM . I find about 90 per cent of the commercials irritating , obnoxious , or repetitious , and always turn off the volume until they 're finished . This saves my ears and also provides exercise while driving . I ' DO N'T HAVE a remote-control switch for TV at home , but I find the advertising on commercial TV so repetitious and irritating that I watch Channel 11 much of the time , and keep reading matter handy during commercials on other channels . Some commercials are palatable . I enjoy the ones with dogs . A pie company has a cute one now with people sneaking bites of pie . The beer commercials with Rodney Dangerfield are funny . But those things for upset stomachs , and for keeping your teeth in , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ avoid buying products with objectionable commercials . But what kind of impact does this constant pounding have on our unconscious minds ? You really hai'T to actively , positively resist or you 'll find yourself economically supporting the actor who growls " Dow Jones DOWN again . . . " ( This thoroughly unpleasant actor is selling automobiles , in case you 've missed that stinker. )
