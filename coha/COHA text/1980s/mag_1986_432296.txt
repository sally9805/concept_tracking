 | IN 1939 the 3.4 million Jews living in Poland formed the world 's second largest Diaspora community . Today perhaps as few as 5,000 of them are left , the remnants . Giants of literature , thinkers , reformers , scholars , and politicians grew up and worked in Poland . But later , during the Second World War , Poland became the land of the Holocaust . And even though that crime was planned and carried out by Germans , its shadow fell on the country and the people who were its witnesses and , what is worse , did not always sympathize . During the 41 years since the war , only very dramatic events like the mass emigration of 1968 , in which more than 30,000 Jews left Poland after an episode of official anti-Semitism , have drawn the world 's attention to Polish Jews . The rest is covered in silence . Polish Jews , the remnants , are mostly old , lonely , ill people . Most members of the Jewish community are 70 or older .

Lublin , a " Jewish Oxford , " was famed throughout Europe for Talmudic and cabalistic learning . It was an important center of Hebrew printing .

More than four decades later I have come to Lublin to find ten , a minyan , the number of males aged 13 and above required by Jewish law to form a quorum for prayer .

He lost his faith as a young man , even though every one of the 4,000 Jews in his hometown of Bilgoraj was religious . Some more , some less , but everyone observed tradition . Adler joined the Communist Party of Poland . In that region the Communists ? Jews , Poles , and Ukrainians ? " did their work " together . They distributed underground literature , agitated , formed trade unions , or organized cells in the existing ones . " We kept the police busy , " Adler says .

He has known Adler since their prewar party activism , they are still ember 1 Last Jews of Poland friends , and they go to the prayerhouse together . " We do n't believe , " Ungier says , " but we go so that there can be ten and they can pray . They need to be supported somehow , do n't they ?

" During the war the only thing I wondered about was whether I would ever be lucky enough to see a loaf of bread lying on the table , slice it , and eat it in peace .

Those are the foresters , the Poles who saved my life . " HENRYK LADEN , the sixth member of the Lublin minyan , lives 65 miles to the north in the town of Siedlce . Laden 's everyday dress is a semi-military jacket with three rows of ribbons and miniature medals pinned on the chest . Their originals completely cover half of the dress uniform jacket that hangs in the closet , always ready to be put on . And Laden puts it on often , even if there is no holiday . His richly equipped apartment is full of mementos from World War II : pictures , photographs , military memorabilia . The army was the great love of Laden 's life ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made history , " he says , and he is not exaggerating much . Every Polish student learns 381  | about the First Kosciuszko Division , which was the beginning of today 's army . Henryk Laden , arrested and transported to Siberia at the beginning of the war , had four years of difficult residence in the U.S.S.R. behind him . So as soon as he heard about the creation of a Polish army in the Soviet Union , he left the collective farm where he had spent the previous few months . He arrived at Seltsy on the Oka in May 1943 , among the first volunteers . He became a gunner in the First Light Artillery Regiment . The equipment they had in those days was modest at best . Things did not change until the United States sent thousands of vehicles and spare parts to Moscow as aid to its ally .

" Oh yes , a lot . There were five of us from my little town near Lwow : Markus Lang , Pomeranz , Targielski , Reiser , and me . A list of Jewish soldiers of the First Kosciuszko Division who were killed in action was published in a Jewish Historical Institute bulletin . There is a page and a half of names and another page and a half of those who were decorated . That shows that Jews are n't so full of fear , that they can fight just as well as others , sometimes better . Unfortunately , that part of the history of Polish Jews is little known .

" Laden pauses , smiles , and adds completely unexpectedly : " But you know , it 's all worth as much as a sucked egg . " " THE MOST DEVOUT among us is Rafael Adar , " one of the Lublin : Jews confided . The Adars live it Wlodawa , a small town smack or : the Soviet border . The little house stands on a quiet side street . Low , wooden , with a small veranda and a yard not much bigger than the veranda An old gray-haired woman is sitting motionless on a bench near the door . When I ask after the Adars , she beams and grasps my hand " That 's me , child . I 'm Sara Adar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that 's good . that 's good . Nobody visits old people . Come here , daughter , and let me give you a kiss . ' Amazed and moved by such a reception , I bend to kiss the woman on the cheek , and she raises herself and hugs me tight . We enter the house with our arms around each other . It is divided into a room and the kitchen . Sara worries that she has nothing in the house and good-naturedly scolds me for arriving unannounced . She would have baked a cake and cooked a good dinner . After innumerable assurances on my part that I want nothing but a cup of tea , we sit down together . " We are old Jews , " she says . " The last Jew in town . " Before the war there were so many Jews ir . Wlodawa that it would have taken you day to count them .

Only dogs moved around outside the houses , candles shone in every window . the singing from the many synagogues carried on the peaceful air . The old woman tells it so colorfully and vividly that I do not even hear her husband come into the room . " Oh , Rafael , " Sara cries as she gets up and National Geographic , September 1986 e Last Jel  | leads her husband to me . " Look , dear , whom heaven has sent to us . " Rafael Adar is a short , slight man dressed in an old threadbare suit , with a felt hat on his head . The face beneath the hat is unusually soft , benevolent , and seems somewhat absent . We greet each other warmly , like old friends . Sara shakes her gray head , and I have no difficulty imagining how she was once young and full of energy and ran through the fields in the nearby village of Hanna and how she raced against her brothers to swim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She swam the river for the last time to escape to the Soviet side shortly after the Germans arrived . When she returned after seven years , she had no parents , no family . Rafael has gone to the kitchen to make tea for himself . Sara watches him sadly . " My Rafael is n't what he once was . A year ago he had a stroke , and it paralyzed him . " The old man stands in the doorway smiling gently at us . " Rafael , sing something , " Sara says , lively again . " Because you know , daughter , my Rafael is not a cantor , but when he opened his mouth to pray , you did n't want to eat anything , not even on Yom Kippur . " " What should I sing , Sara ?

We sit in silence for a long while . Then Sara turns to me . " And when they brought him to me , he was so skinny , miserable , and beat up . That was not long after the war . I had no one , and he had no one . He had lost his whole family . I fed him alittle , dressed him , and we went to a rabbi I knew in Legnica to get married . Oy , that was a story . I was alone in a room with the women when suddenly it hit me . No mother , no father , no sister , no brother . Strangers are going to lead me to the canopy . What do I need such a wedding for ? I do n't want it ! And I started to cry and scream . Nobody could calm me down . They coaxed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see now that you do n't regret it , " I interject . " How could I regret it ? " When I leave their home a few hours later , they walk me to the street . We say long goodbyes . It is somehow hard for me to leave . At the corner I turn around . The small wooden house is still visible . On the bench by the door sit the two old people . Sara is resting her head on Rafael 's shoulder . They are silent , looking straight ahead at the empty street . THE CEMETERY in Miffdzyrzec Podlaski , 50 miles north of Lublin , looks impressive ? at least from the outside . A high brick wall surrounds a good-size piece of land . I open the heavy iron gate . Right inside , on the grounds of the cemetery , stands the caretaker 's house . At the sight of me , a powerful German shepherd almost breaks its chain . Summoned by the barking , a fat man appears from inside the house and we talk about the cemetery . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left the cemetery in ruins . The gravestones were smashed to pieces , broken and shattered by bullets , since the Gestapo set up a shooting range here . The walls were also partly destroyed and partly torn down . The bricks had been required for other purposes . The caretaker leads me around the cemetery . In its depths , sheep are grazing . " What I do n't mow , they eat , " he says , as if he wants to forestall my question . The cemetery is old . Many of the matzevahs come from the 18th and 19th centuries . Some of them are cast iron , unique and beautifully ornamented monuments . MiOzyrzec Podlaski was a rich town . There were beautiful synagogues here . One of them , from the 18th century and built of great stone blocks , was famous . It took the Germans more than a month to demolish it . " How many Jews were saved and returned after the war ? " I ask . 4  | " How many were saved I do n't know , but very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still live here ? " " No , there are no Jews here any more . The last one died five years ago . He lies there . The caretaker points into the shadows of the cemetery . " I know , though , that one is left for sure . He 's the one I 'm looking for . " The caretaker shakes his head decisively . " He has a Polish wife , and he changed his name , " I add . National Geographic , September 1986 Ike Last Jews 0 " Now that 's another story . Anastazy Domanski . Of course , I know him . He 's a brushmaker . He lives on Polna Street , number 37 . Only he 's sort of Jew-non-Jew . " The eighth member of the Lublin minyan has been baptized . An hour later I am sitting with Anastazy Domanski in a meadow near the forest . Here , on the tall grass , he spreads his coat .

" Did n't they give you my address in Lublin ? They know it well enough . " " They gave it , but not the complete address , " I throw in , not wanting to hurt him . Still , Domanski makes a dismissive gesture . " I know , they 're a little ashamed of me , even though I often lead their prayers . " The old man lights a cigarette and unexpectedly bursts into tears . " Something forced me to change my name , the way they killed those two . . . a young couple in the very flower of life . Sara was your age . She died in my arms .... I am Kagan , Natan Kagan . " He pulls a handkerchief out of his pocket and wipes his eyes . " When was that ? " I ask . " In ' 46 .

That evening she gave me an excellent meal . She would n't let me go . I ask you by all the saints , Natan , do n't go .

" " What 's it like now ? " " They 're used to me . " " For 30 years you lived far from Jews , far from their religion . " " I did n't forget . During those years I forgot nothing . You ca n't forget that . It 's not like this grass . " Kagan leans forward and pulls out a handful of grass with a violent motion . He raises it and waves it in front of my eyes .

When I am ready to leave , thinking there is no one there , I hear a shuffling behind the door and a woman 's wary voice : " Who 's there ? " I introduce myself . The woman begins questioning me : Where are you from ? What do you want ? Who sent you ? I repeat all my references to the closed door , but it has no effect . I go on explaining . At last she asks , " What is my first name ? " Without pause I say something different from what is printed on the card . " Libe . Libe Fiksman . " That does the trick . The door slowly opens .

" Your husband is dead ? " I ask , shocked . " He died . He died , the poor man , " Libe Fiksman says . " He was 92 , and his time had come .

" " On the Thursday before the bar mitzvah , when you had your examination , you fainted in the synagogue . " " Only the minyan was there . I stood a long time near the bimah . I waited and waited . I was terribly frightened , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then I fell . I woke up on a bench . The old men were standing over me , and each one was offering me his heart medicine . They all carry nitroglycerin . " " On Saturday it went better . " " I was n't so nervous any more . It was a different atmosphere ? a full synagogue , my friends . Once I stepped onto the bimah , it became totally quiet . Behind my back I could feel that they were all listening . It was funny ? as soon as I started reading , all those old gentlemen began prompting me . Every one of them ! When I walked off the bimah , they all hugged and kissed me , even though I did n't know a lot of them . " " How do you get along with your brother ? Does n't it bother you that one of you wants above all to be a Pole and the other one above all a Jew ? " " I do n't see anything bad about that . It all comes down to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religion . He says he wants to be free . " " And you ? " " My religion does n't hinder me in any way . " " For thousands of years being a Jew has involved persecution , suffering , even death . " " Yes , I know something about that . " " How do you understand the bar mitzvah ? What does it oblige you to do ? " " Not to renounce it . " " Not to renounce what ? " " Jewishness . " " So now how would you answer the question , What does it mean to be a Jew ? ' " " It seems simple at first . And then the more you know , the harder and harder it becomes being a Jew . Especially in Poland . " " But I see that you 're not turning back . " " No . I 'll take the risks . " 4
