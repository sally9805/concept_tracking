' ' P/e ? ' ' What ' s that ? // Well , its not an abbreviation for physical education , or potential earnings , but the latter ' s not a bad guess. // // Strictly defined , p/e is the market price of a stock divided by annual earnings , or price/earnings ratio . Sound like financial double talk ? // OK . In plain English , p/e is simply a way to relate the price of a company ' s stock to its profits or earnings . Let ' s say , for example , that Sliderules Unlimited has a p/e of 6 : Your stock is selling today at $12 . Your total earnings per share for the latest 12-month reporting period were $2 . Thus , $12 ( current price ) divided by $2 ( earnings ) equals 6 ( p/e ) . // But who cares ? What good is a p/e to you ? // P/e can be a measure of how popular the stock is with other investors , of how much people are willing to pay for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' s , a common benchmark is the average p/e for the Standard &; Poor ' s 500-stock index : It ' s now about 11 . So , as p/e ' s go , the p/e of 6 for Sliderules Unlimited is rather low . Nowadays a high-p/e company tends to have something above 11. // Generally , a young , growing firm with a promising future will have a high p/e - perhaps 15 , 25 , or even 40 . Why ? Because the price of the stock is pumped up by investors expecting leaps in the earnings of the company. // ' ' A typical high-p/e case will have no earnings history , a very exciting product ( perhaps still on the drawing boards ) , a great story behind it - and the market believes it , ' ' explains Ernest Wiggins , manager of Fidelity ' s Discoverer Fund , a mutual fund that hunts for ' ' undervalued ' stocks . These high-p/e companies are ' ' the linchpin of the new-issues market , ' ' Mr. Wiggins says. // Often , all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The high-tech industry , in the recent past , projected an image of rapid , sustainable growth - and thus companies were awarded high p/e ' s by investors . If an investor notices a company with a p/e out of step with the rest of the industry , that may be a sign of financial trouble or perhaps a strategy that the investment community deems unlikely to be profitable. // On the other hand , a normally low p/e stock might have a temporarily high p/e . The earnings have dropped below normal but the stock price has not fallen , since the earnings are expected to bounce back . So the spread between the stock price and the earnings gives it a high p/e ratio . Eventually , the earnings rebound faster than the price rises . So the stock goes back to having a low p/e. // Unlike its glamorous high p/e cousin , the low-p/e stock may have a rather stodgy image . Which brings us back to back to your Great-Aunt Alice ' s legacy , Sliderules Unlimited. // Sliderules rests on solid financial footing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the market for slide rules and drafting instruments . But the future for such products is nothing to get too excited about . In fact , Sliderules fits the classic profile of a low-p/e stock , as described by Wiggins at Fidelity : ' ' The stock doesn ' t move much - just a few points either way . Earnings don ' t change much . The dividend payouts are relatively high , giving a 7 to 10 percent yield . And it just goes along like that for a period of years. ' ' // But a low-p/e strategist figures that eventually a company as sound as Sliderules Unlimited will be sold or strike out in a new direction . Maybe the company discovers that slide-rule technology can also be applied to make a pollution-control widget that the government has just made mandatory for every smokestack company in America . Maybe a foreign country bans the use of ' ' imperialist calculator technology ' ' and places a huge order for slide rules . Or perhaps the president of Sliderules hands the reins over to his son , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school , and Junior wants to liquidate certain assets to finance a venture that will reap ' ' extraordinary ' ' profits shortly. // If something like this happens , ' ' it may be a terrific opportunity to buy up as much stock as you can , ' ' says Wiggins . As other investors sit up and take notice of the changes , the price of the stock may rise dramatically . ' ' If you ' re wrong , then you still have a nice steady dividend payment . If you ' re right , you could score big. ' ' // The low-p/e stock-selection strategy is just one method of picking a company that has intrinsic value or potential value which appears greater than the price the market has currently placed on it . Somewhat similar bargain-hunting strategies were championed by Benjamin Graham and elevated to recent prominence by disciple Warren Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway . Mining for low-p/e stocks is also the heart of David Dreman ' s ' ' contrarian ' ' investment strategy. // Of late , some soothsayers on Wall Street have predicted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The theory : Investors will bid up the prices of stocks now because they think the ' ' quality ' ' of future earnings will improve . Inflation is low , so companies can ' t just raise prices on products to boost earnings . Higher earnings must come from increases in sales and productivity as well as better management . Also , the theory continues , interest rates come down , which will reduce the cost of borrowing , making it less expensive to make these improvements . And lower interest rates tend to make stocks more attractive than fixed-income securities. // While the low-p/e school remains popular , it has shortcomings . For instance , the relationship between price and earnings is a useful investment tool only so long as you believe earnings truly reflect a company ' s worth , or potential worth . Some investors think that because earnings can be manipulated - through any number of accounting or short-term management strategies - they are simply not reliable indicators of a company ' s health. // Instead , investors may compare stock prices to cash flow or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' s financial status and future prospects . And analysts have found that prices can swing dramatically on news unrelated to earnings , thereby making it difficult to decide what a ' ' normal ' ' or ' ' reasonable ' ' p/e ratio should be for certain stocks. // But that does not mean you should rush off and sell Sliderules Unlimited . Who knows , maybe your Great-Aunt Alice was a good friend of Benjamin Graham. // For further reading on investing in low-p/e and undervalued stocks , see ' ' The New Contrarian Investment Strategy , ' ' by David Dreman ; ' ' The Intelligent Investor , ' ' by Benjamin Graham ; or ' ' Super Stocks , ' ' by Kenneth L.
