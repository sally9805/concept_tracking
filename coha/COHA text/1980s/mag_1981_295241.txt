COVERSTORY <P> South Florida is hit by a hurricane of crime , drugs and refugees <P> November . The days grow short , the nights cold . Time to reach for that travel brochure for , where else , South Florida , America 's favorite winter playground . Hmmm , let 's see now . Here is a picture of palm trees swaying gently under a cottony blue sky while a family frolics in the foamy surf . Here is a snowy white heron flitting along a river of sea grass in the Everglades , the mangrove and palmetto serene as a Sunday morning . There is a creamy stucco Palm Beach mansion , its red tile roof glinting fiercely in the sun and bougainvillea rioting , colorfully in the yard .

Drug smuggling could be the region 's major industry , worth anywhere from $7 billion to $12 billion a year ( vs. $12 billion for real estate and $9 billion for tourism , the area 's two biggest legitimate businesses ) . Miami 's Federal Reserve branch has a currency surplus of $5 billion , mostly in drug-generated $50 and $100 bills , or more than the nation 's twelve Federal Reserve banks combined . Drug money has corrupted banking , real estate , law enforcement and even the fishing industry , whose practitioners are abandoning the pursuit of snapper and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ square grouper , " as fishermen call it ) from freighters at sea to the mainland . About one-third of the region 's murders are drug-related . <P> &gt; Since the spring of 1980 , when Cuban President Fidel Castro opened the port of Mariel to those who wanted to leave , about
