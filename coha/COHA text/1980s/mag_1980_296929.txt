That girl tells positively all <P> I may be oldfashioned , but drugs , pornography and even pecan-ripple ice cream do n't turn on my love lights . I like sexy talk , music and a drink . If a man undresses me , all the better . Still , I can be aggressive sometimes , and I 've seduced at least one man in my life . It should n't be surprising that I want to make love more often . <P> Keeping one 's love life under control is not always so easy . Nearly a quarter of the women like me have had abortions . Maybe that 's because the same number do n't use any form of birth control . But I do . Roger likes me because of that . Roger is my eighth lover , which is average for a single woman living alone . He is married , but I can cope with that , especially since one out of every two women like me have had similar affairs . And most have enjoyed the experience , even though 45% say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know all this ? Because I and 106,000 women like me ( we 're mostly single working women between the ages of 18 and 35 ) responded to a sex poll in my favorite magazine . The results will be out next month , and then we 'll know positively everything about ourselves . <P> Well , I 've got to run . This working girl is going to skip lunch and use the hour to make love to Roger . Some 55% of us say we indulge in such sex breaks . I love that survey . I guess you could say I 'm that median Cosmopolitan girl .
