But now the company is under siege from another direction . A group led by the Tulsa investor Joseph A. Frates has proposed taking control through a leveraged buyout. // Mr. Frates made a non-specific offer in September and has since joined forces with the British investor Alan Clore of the Warrego Financial Corporation to propose a $20-a-share buyout - $7 in cash and the rest in unspecified securities . Kaiser management has refused to discuss the proposal , and Wall Street has also been cool , with Kaiser ' s stock remaining essentially flat . It closed today at $17. 25 , up 62. 5 cents , on the New York Stock Exchange. // The Frates group now holds at least 14. 4 percent of the company ' s 43. 8 million common shares . And it was recently joined by two former Kaiser executives : Ira Davidson , former executive vice president , who took early retirement in 1982 after 26 years with Kaiser , and Arthur Woodward , a vice president who took early retirement in 1984 after 29 years with the company , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are many analysts who believe that Kaiser ' s current management has done about as well as possible , and these analysts question whether Mr. Frates could do better . " The company is saddled with a lot of problems they have no control over , " said Richard McClow , an analyst with Duff &; Phelps Inc . " Changing the guard won ' t really solve them . " <> <> A Number of Difficulties // Kaiser ' s problems began with the recession of 1982 and have been compounded by a series of difficult situations including a ninefold increase in energy costs in the Pacific Northwest , where 60 percent of Kaiser ' s primary aluminum production occurs ; a prolonged drought in Ghana , which halted production at the company ' s hydroelectric-powered smelters there , depriving Kaiser of its lowest-cost aluminum for two years , and a modernization project that disrupted production at a plant in Trentwood , Wash . At the same time , increased foreign competition , aided by the strong dollar , has dropped aluminum prices precipitously. // The difficulties have shown on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ended Sept. 30 , Kaiser reported losses of $17. 7 million , on revenues of $526. 4 million , compared with losses of $73. 2 million , on revenues of $548. 8 million , for the period a year ago . But the company ' s chairman and chief executive , Cornell C. Maier , predicted in a recent interview that the company will return to the black in 1986 , unless there is a general economic downturn. // " We have done a lot of things to insure that we do well when the aluminum market turns , which it will , " Mr. Maier said , adding that these moves , coupled with a stock price below book value , may account for the takeover threat. // Some analysts have calculated that Kaiser ' s breakup value on a per-share basis is substantially more than its stock price . Last May , for example , when Kaiser shares were trading in the low teens , Nicolas Toufexis , an analyst with Oppenheimer &; Company , issued a report that estimated Kaiser ' s potential liquidation value at $27 a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ value through selling the pieces might prove hard to do - as Kaiser itself has discovered . <> <> A Point of Agreement // Kaiser must also contend with a heavy debt load - $1. 2 billion , or about $29. 77 per share . Both Mr. Maier and Mr. Frates agree that the debt situation must be dealt with. // On that subject , Mr. Maier has said only that he is working with the company ' s banks on a recapitalization plan and " hopes to see something in the next month or two. " // According to his Dec. 5 letter to Mr. Maier , Mr. Frates would , after acquiring Kaiser , " commence a program of asset sales , refinancings and joint ventures with the goal of reducing Kaiser ' s existing debt by approximately $1 billion within the next several years and operating a ' core ' aluminum fabricating , industrial chemical and real estate company on a profitable basis. " // Analysts say this plan is not very different from the steps Kaiser management is already taking . Those include the modernization at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Bonneville Power Administration to reduce energy costs ; labor concessions from the United Steelworkers of America , and a de-emphasis on primary aluminum production in favor of aluminum fabrication , which is more profitable . In addition , the drought in Ghana has abated , allowing Kaiser ' s plant there to resume operating. // During 1985 , the company sold businesses involved in agricultural chemicals , trading and steel refractories . It retains a profitable real estate development subsidiary , for which it is seeking a 50 percent partner ; an oil and gas subsidiary , Kaiser Energy Inc. , in partnership with Chevron , and an industrial chemicals business. // These are all prudent moves , analysts say , but they are taking time to pay off . Kaiser ' s managers have " had good strategy , but they should have told investors it would take a long time , " Mr. Toufexis of Oppenheimer said . " It ' s not a terrible situation , " he added . " They are going to see some results . " <> <> A Leveraged Situation // Other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , question the viability of a leveraged buyout of a company that is already so heavily leveraged. // J. Clarence Morrison , an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. , said the Frates group " could run into great difficulties " because many of Kaiser ' s assets are not easily salable . Primary aluminum smelters are not an attractive purchase without long-term energy contracts , and anyone buying the Ghana operation would be as much at the mercy of rainfall as Kaiser has been , he said. // He acknowledged that Kaiser ' s real estate holdings are undervalued , but he pointed out that the company has been trying to sell 50 percent of that division for some time and that any purchaser would need additional capital to develop the properties. // Until the Frates group details its plans to deal with these problems , institutional investors will remain cool , analysts say . " It ' s a marginal bid , " Mr. McClow of Duff &; Phelps said . " Investors would really just be swapping one piece of paper for another. " // Mr. Frates declined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , said the group wants to hold talks with Kaiser management and does not view itself as corporate raiders . " It remains our opinion , " he said , " that a friendly transaction is in the best interests of shareholders . " <> <> A Previous Deal // Mr. Frates did successfully take the Kaiser Steel Corporation private in 1983 in a deal valued at $375 million . ( Kaiser Steel and Kaiser Aluminum were both part of Kaiser Industries before its voluntary breakup in 1977 . ) But Mr. Maier said there was a crucial difference in that transaction : Kaiser Steel was for sale , while Kaiser Aluminum is not. // " We are not impressed with Mr. Frates ' s track record , " Mr. Maier said . " But we are taking him seriously . There may be a proxy fight . If there is one , we ' ll be ready. " // Mr. Maier has said that the future profitability of the aluminum industry depends on the reduction of primary domestic production , so he welcomed the recent announcement by the Aluminum Company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its capacity . Alcoa is the nation ' s largest aluminum producer , followed by the Reynolds Metals Company and then Kaiser . Although he said it was too soon to say specifically how the Alcoa move would affect Kaiser , Mr. Maier called it a " very positive step. " // Analysts concur , saying that the Alcoa move and the probable elimination of several small aluminum producers should reduce industry capacity enough that prices will be begin to rise. // Last week , Kaiser announced price increases averaging 10 percent for fabricated aluminum , following an increase in the price of aluminum ingot on the London Metals Exchange from about 50 cents to 53 cents a pound. //
