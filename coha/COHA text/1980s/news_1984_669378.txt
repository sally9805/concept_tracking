While McNamara might appear to have a clubhouse full of all-stars ( Reggie Jackson , Fred Lynn , Rod Carew , etc. ) , they are neither that young nor that talented anymore . In fact , Mac , playing baseball ' s percentages to the hilt , has been consistently benching Jackson , Lynn , and Carew against left-handed pitching . McNamara has also done an outstanding job of picking spots for two Angel rookies , outfielder Gary Pettis , and shortstop Dick Schofield , neither of whom have solved big league pitching yet on a regular basis , but both of whom have helped in other ways . Pettis , for example , appears well on his way to 50 stolen bases . Schofield , who won ' t be 22 until November , has improved rapidly in the field. // While critics are always quick to jump on California ' s pitching problems , McNamara has somehow coaxed 17 complete games out of a staff that has consisted mainly of 41-year-old Tommy John and 37-year-old Geoff Zahn , plus youngsters Ron Romanick and Mike Witt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( N.H. ) in the Double A Eastern League , has a shot at being the American League ' s Rookie of the Year . The young right-hander , who goes out and challenges hitters with a fastball that darts and a curveball that breaks at the knees , has all the makings of a future 20-game winner . The reason Ron wasn ' t that impressive with Nashua was an arm problem that he has since overcome. // McNamara , whose managing philosophy is so simple that it should be bottled - make sure you know who your best players are at the moment and get them into your lineup - rarely explodes . But when a stretch of shoddy baseball saw the Angels win only six of 18 games near the end of May , John showed his players a Mr. Hyde side that they had never been exposed to before . One thing Mac would like to get straightened out is the Angels ' inability to win at home , where they are a mediocre 11-17 . On the road , California is a much more impressive 22-12. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Detroit Tigers , who started a string of 14 consecutive games on June 1 against their closest pursuers in the American League East ( Baltimore and Toronto ) , held up beautifully during that stretch for Manager Sparky Anderson . Faced with two hungry rivals hoping to close ground , the Tigers split the 14 games evenly and actually emerged from the two-week grind with their lead slightly bigger than at the start . ' ' Although everybody talks about Jack Morris and Dan Petry being our two top pitchers , I think Milt Wilcox also has a great chance of winning 20 or more games for us , ' ' Anderson said. // Actually the hottest team in the AL East lately has been the Boston Red Sox , who have suddenly shot over the . 500 mark after getting first baseman Bill Buckner in a trade with the Chicago Cubs . Buckner , at the moment , might just be the most reliable No. 6 hitter in baseball . The 1980 National League batting champion has always had a flair for getting on base , keeping rallies alive , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were to measure the combined length of Buckner ' s hits they wouldn ' t reach from Old Ironsides to the Bunker Hill Monument . But his 356 doubles going into this season say a lot about Bill ' s mental toughness and bat control . Buckner has already had six years in the big leagues in which he has struck out fewer than 19 times. // // Elsewhere around the majors // // * The New York Mets , after looking at close-up films of slugger Darryl Strawberry , are convinced that his current batting slump is due to overswinging . After a great April in which Strawberry hit . 363 , including five homers and 12 runs batted in , Darryl just did keep his batting average . 200 for May . Now Strawberry has compounded his problems by trying too hard and fighting himself. // // * When Doc Edwards , manager of the Cleveland Indians minor league Maine Guides farm club , located righthander Steve Farr to tell him that the parent club was recalling him , he found Farr in a Portland , Maine , movie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ' a film starring Robert Redford about a baseball player returning to the big leagues after a 15-year absence. // // * Ever since the Boston Red Sox signed 21-year-old right-hander Roger Clemens , who was the winner for Texas in the final game of last year ' s College World Series , they have been making extraordinary claims about his ability . Not too surprisingly , however , Clemens has found big league hitters a little tougher to fool so far . He was shelled by Cleveland in his first start , and although he now has a 2-1 record , he has also been hit hard on other occasions without being involved in the decision - giving up 54 hits and 28 runs in just 351/3 innings for a 7. 13 earned run average. // // * If you are wondering how fast a team can go from peerage to steerage in major league baseball , consider the 1982 World Champion St. Louis Cardinals , who have played below the . 500 mark since that time . Except for Joaquin Andujar , the Cardinals don ' t have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ catcher Darrell Porter , the team ' s leading home run hitter so far , seldom is used against left-handers. // // * After at least three big league teams asked Kansas City for permission to talk with Manager Dick Howser , the Royals decided to extend Howser ' s present contract . Two of the teams interested in Howser were rumored to be the Boston Red Sox and the San Francisco Giants - the Red Sox simply checking on Dick ' s availability for next year. // // * Only a few days after telling me that the Cincinnati Reds were a much better team in 1984 and that his shift from shortstop to third base on April 29 was no big deal , Dave Concepcion has suggested that the Reds trade him for a pitcher . Apparently Concepcion ' s first choice is Los Angeles , where the Dodgers might be willing to part with veteran Burt Hooton , plus one of their young bullpen hurlers. // // * The New York Mets this year have joined the Chicago White Sox and San Francisco Giants in the use of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Mets Manager Dave Johnson also plans to program every rival National League hitter into his computer so that he ' ll have a better idea of how to cope with these people in clutch situations. // // * Veteran Oakland infielder Davey Lopes says he doesn ' t care if he ever plays another game at second base and would like to finish his career in left field . Lopes lost his starting job when the A ' s signed Joe Morgan as a free agent during the off season. // // * The Cleveland Indians , who haven ' t finished in the American League ' s first division for 16 years , say they have some exceptional talent in the minor leagues . The problem is that its estimated maturity is three years away and Cleveland fans are tired of waiting . Meanwhile several of the Indians ' veteran players keep asking to be traded ; thus further unsettling the ball club. // //
