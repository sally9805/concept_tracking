When this small import was new it looked smart as a green frog , but it ran so badly that twice I had to be towed back from Boston , a good sixty miles . Now that the body has corroded and the left fender hangs like a tattered skirt , wafting in the wind , the engine perversely purrs . Since I have a respectable sedan in which to drive to church and transport my resident writing and art students from the airport , it doesn ' t matter that I sometimes ramble around town in the rusty heap . There ' s even a sort of distinction about it as I drive up to the post office carrying a load of books to mail out to customers , with an audience of at least one head shaking in amused puzzlement . No one in town can boast so much rust still on the road . It ' s so awful it ' s wonderful. // I will not part with the heap , because it ' s thrifty on fuel and useful in ways that ordinary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is Becky ' s favorite place to sleep . She is my German shepherd , who was rescued from Boston ' s streets and brought here to the woods of New Hampshire . Becky , unlike my other dogs , can ' t be confined to a run because she climbs every fence we ' ve put up . So she ' s on a long chain outdoors and , when the weather ' s inclement , climbs into the station wagon and happily goes to sleep . Even in thunderstorms which terrify her , Becky seems to understand she ' s safe in the car and gets behind the steering wheel as if this were preferred seating , like the back of a plane. // So Becky and I are partial to the heap and a little on the defensive with those who don ' t appreciate real distinction . The local gas station attendant , who fills up the heap , always smiles and asks , ' ' Still running ? ' ' // ' ' You bet , ' ' I answer smugly , since our rusty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a nearby town and doesn ' t make jokes about venerable vehicles because he ' s a collector of horse-drawn buggies . ' ' Just wait till inspection time , ' ' the joker tells me. // It seems the motor vehicle authorities at our state capitol don ' t care how well a car runs , but if it has too much rust it won ' t pass inspection as a passenger vehicle . When the time of judgment approached this year I noticed that my neighbor was riding around in a pickup truck almost as rusty as my wagon. // ' ' How come they let you on the road ? ' ' I asked with a smile at his fender which half hung on. // ' ' I ' m a farmer , ' ' he answered with a grin . ' ' Farm vehicles can have all sorts of rust as long as the brakes and headlights work . You just can ' t go on the major highways. ' ' // ' ' Go on , ' ' I said . ' ' If you ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' // ' ' Trees , ' ' he answered with his Popeye grin. // ' ' I ' ve got trees , too , ' ' I countered , ' ' but that doesn ' t make me a tree farmer. ' ' // ' ' If you ' ve got more than ten acres , maybe it does , ' ' he answered , and rattled down the road. // With this tantalizing prospect I went down to our town office where they take your money and dispense licenses. // ' ' I want to register my station wagon as a farm vehicle , ' ' I said in matter-of-fact tones. // The clerk who ' s married to one of our town fathers and knows all of us citizens by heart looked at me sharply and pronounced what I expected . ' ' You ' re not a farmer. ' ' // I repeated what my neighbor had said . ' ' I ' ve got thirty acres of trees , two barns full of wood , and a lot of it I ' d be glad to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ' Tree farming isn ' t your primary occupation , ' ' she announced to the line of citizens behind me. // ' ' I ' d like to see where the rules say it has to be , ' ' I asked respectfully , beginning to enjoy myself. // She picked up a sheaf of papers stapled together . ' ' Here are the new rules , read them . ' ' Apparently she hadn ' t . There wasn ' t a word about primary occupation . It just said the vehicle couldn ' t travel farther than twenty miles , which I wouldn ' t on any account do , and that it mustn ' t be used to bring produce to market , which I could readily agree to unless you consider my books my produce. // When I pointed all this out to her , she broke into a smile and proceeded to declare on paper that my station wagon was an agricultural vehicle . It even cost a lot less than the regular registration fee . Then I got my heap inspected by our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , willing to do a perfect job without making your wallet thin . He pronounced our wagon in perfect mechanical condition and duly affixed the agricultural plates. // Something of its new status must have gotten through to the heap , because it did something I have never known a car to do - grew mushrooms . It started with a leaky roof that we ' ve tried unsuccessfully for two years to seal up with those commercial goos which come in efficient-looking tubes . The wagon just went on leaking and the carpeting in the front of the car was so continually soaked that I was afraid it would rust out the frame below . I piled layers of newspaper over the floor to absorb what they could . Sometime later , when the newspapers were thoroughly soaked , I went to change them and discovered underneath a lovely layer of mushrooms . The heap had taken to heart its agricultural plates. // The next time we drove up to the local station for gas - after achieving agricultural status  --  the attendant noticed our new inspection sticker. // ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // I told him to look at our plates indicating AG for an agricultural vehicle. // ' ' Pretty good , ' ' he grinned and had the grace to give our windshield an extra swipe . So now we haul firewood from the barn to the house and trash to the dump as usual , with new respect for ourselves . Becky goes on sleeping in her favorite car , unaware that she is now a farm dog and should work for a living chasing sheep instead of cats . To stick to the rules I ' ve persuaded my tree-farming neighbor to cut down some of our dead trees and store them in the barn , and should you be in the market for firewood you know where to come . We ' ve got professional standing to keep up and a heap to support . We might even throw in some mushrooms. // //
