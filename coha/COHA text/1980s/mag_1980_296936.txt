Reagan 's Taiwan tangle exposes basic campaign weaknesses <P> " I misstated . " With that flat admission , Ronald Reagan last week tried to clarify , once again , his confusing views on exactly what sort of relations he favors with Taiwan . Reagan grudgingly backed away from what he called his mis-statement-a pledge to establish " an official governmental relationship " with Taiwan-and promised merely to abide by the Taiwan Relations Act of 1979 , which expressly declares that relations between the two nations must be conducted by a " nongovernmental " body . <P> Campaign Director William Casey dismissed the entire episode as a " semantic mishmash , " but the strained faces of staffers-and of Reagan and Running Mate George Bush , who was at his side during the press conference in Los Angeles-reflected a far deeper concern than that . Reagan 's earlier remarks had managed to infuriate Peking , create the impression of a rift between Reagan and Bush , and make Reagan appear to be unschooled in an important area of U.S. foreign affairs . The episode also managed to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reagan on the defensive , correcting his own views , just when the Republican nominee had planned to be on the offensive , attacking Jimmy Carter 's record . <P> U.S. Ambassador to China Leonard Woodcock called a rare press conference of his own in Peking the following day to blast Reagan . Charged Woodcock : " To endanger the carefully crafted relationship between the People 's Republic and the U.S. is to run the risk of gravely weakening the American international position at a dangerous time . " Appointed by Jimmy Carter to his post in January 1979 , Woodcock stressed that he was issuing the warning on his own and had not cleared the statement with either the White House or the State Department , a claim backed up by the Administration . Woodcock 's highly political remarks were unusual , and some might say improper for an ambassador . Understandably , the comments angered the Reagan camp . Said Bush : " I ca n't imagine an ambassador doing that without instructions from Washington . " <P> A staunch supporter of Taiwan for years , Reagan was asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would treat Taiwan . He replied : " One of the things I look forward to most if I am successful in this election is to re-establish official relations between the United States Government and Taiwan . " <P> Such a step would violate the 1978 agreement between the U.S. and China , in which Washington recognized the Peking government as the only legitimate government of China and acknowledged that " there is but one China and Taiwan is part of China . " Furthermore , Washington later agreed to maintain only " unofficial " trade and cultural relations with Taiwan , now carried out through an organization called the American Institute in Taiwan . The name is a polite fiction ; the office is funded by Washington and staffed by State Department personnel " on leave " from their Government jobs . Though the arrangement infuriated the Taiwanese at the time , the controversy quieted as Taiwan continued to prosper commercially and the mainland made no efforts to absorb the island .                   @ @
