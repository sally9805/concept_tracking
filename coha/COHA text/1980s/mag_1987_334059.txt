When TIME 's Los Angeles correspondent Denise Worrell viewed Platoon , a film that batters its audience with the brutalities of the Viet Nam War , her reaction was immediate : " It was my father 's face I saw on the screen . Barely 18 , in a swell of patriotism , he had enlisted in the Marines . He could never talk about fighting the Japanese during World War II , and I sensed that part of him was scar tissue . Platoon gave me my father 's war . That war and Viet Nam were supposed to be very different , but this film showed that every war , for the man in the trenches with a rifle , is the same . " <P> Her enthusiasm for the film , coupled with the knowledge of its outstanding reviews and mounting grosses , prompted her to speed a message to TIME editors in New York City , which resulted in this week 's cover story . <P> Senior Writer and Cinema Critic Richard Corliss , who wrote the main story about Platoon , which was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stone and I were both preparing for this cover story . He was dodging enemy fire in Southeast Asia , and I was taking graduate film courses at Columbia and N.Y.U. Of course , even in the academic cocoon , everyone 's major was Viet Nam , but for us , it was on TV . Stone 's achievement is to rescue this huge national tragedy from the 19-inch screen and put it on the big one , where it belongs . " <P> In Los Angeles , Bureau Chief Dan Goodgame produced an accompanying story on retired Marine Corps Captain Dale Dye , who was the film 's technical adviser . The two had met in 1982 : Goodgame was covering the Middle East for the Miami Herald , while Dye was assigned to the Marine detachment that was ravaged by a terrorist bombing in October 1983 . " Dale was an unabashed war junkie and always had a strong interest in movies about combat , " Goodgame remembers . " Even then he was critical of inauthentic films like Apocalypse Now . " <P> The stories were written with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and TIME Correspondent Elaine Dutka in Los Angeles . Dutka , who majored in political science and modern history during the peak Viet Nam War years , recalls that era as the " beginning of my real political education , a crucial rite of passage . " While viewing Platoon , she was struck by the reaction of veterans around her . " One man told me afterward that it was a relief to be able to share the nightmare he had lived and has yet to shake . " Platoon is a riveting movie , and our cover story tries to capture that intensity .
