At last , the dreaded year is at hand <P> The brilliance of George Orwell 's decision to invert the last two digits of 1948 ( the year he was completing 1984 ) is that it gave his readers a point to watch for in their own time . So they have watched , with trepidation and titillation , up to the present when the fatal year is about to make its entrance . For those who trusted Orwell 's gloomy vision the results may seem disappointing . Some Soviet bloc countries and several scattered dictatorships may be living close to the " Freedom Is Slavery " of Orwell 's imagination , but among the democracies one has to stretch a good deal to find equally condemning evidence . Observers will continue to play intellectual games comparing Big Brother to Big Government , but when Orwell was describing the destruction of human will , the Department of Agriculture was not exactly what he had in mind . Unexciting though it may be to concede , the upcoming year will produce no mass telescreen surveillance , no Ministry of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greeted with utmost reluctance . The 1984 view of things has been almost spiritually important to recent generations because the book cooperated perfectly with this age 's picture of the future . Besides 1984 , the two main Utopian-indeed , antiutopian-texts of the time have been Yevgeny Zamyatin 's We and Aldous Huxley 's Brave New World . They stand in stark contrast to the visions of past ages : Plato 's Republic , Augustine 's City of God , Dante 's Paradise , More 's Utopia , Rousseau , Kant , Marx and the American Dream , which saw the millennium in everything new . No longer . Our antiutopian visions do not presume new discoveries so much as the perversion of things already known , the bleakness of these images due less to a mistrust of science than of basic human nature . <P> Antiutopianism may also be traced to the Bomb , of course . <P> Or it may have grown from the awareness that a Utopia can no longer be isolated , as it was with Plato and More , and that any future view must by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planet . Or perhaps we have come to dissociate knowledge from progress-a faith in progress being essential to Utopian thought-seeing instead every recent advance of the mind as merely one step , neither forward nor backward , along a huge , pitiless circle . <P> So presented , this all sounds terribly pessimistic . A loss of extravagant dreams , one is told , entails a forfeiture of beauty , morals , of humanity itself . The presumption is that one finds happiness in looking forward to being happy , a rock on which many churches have built their following , but one which has often opened an unbridgeable chasm between hope and reality , thus assuring that anyone who lives in the future languishes in the present . Of all the reasons for antiutopianism , perhaps the strongest has been that former Utopian visions offered nothing but momentary heart leaps , that in hard-nosed modern terms , Utopias did not work . <P> But what happens now , when it seems equally clear that antiutopias do not work either ?
