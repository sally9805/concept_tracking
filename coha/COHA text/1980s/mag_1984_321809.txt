Arms control and tax reform are likely to share the spotlight <P> As Ronald Reagan cruised along on his campaign of good feeling this fall , he was vexingly imprecise about his plans for a second term . He extolled peace and prosperity , but he offered few specific proposals for reducing the deficit or controlling the nuclear arms race . <P> Reagan tried to explain away his vagueness with folksy humility . " I 'm kind of superstitious , " he shrugged ; he did not want to appear complacent by looking beyond Election Day . Given his large and unwavering lead in the polls , few were convinced . Walter Mondale , for one , charged that the President was concealing a " secret plan " to raise taxes . <P> In truth , Reagan has no specific plan , secret or otherwise . He has yet to discuss his future moves in any detail , even with his advisers . They say he feels no real sense of urgency ; Reagan believes Reaganism has worked well and needs few refinements . But there are certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control and tax reform . <P> Reagan has always sounded broad themes and relied on his advisers to put them into practice . In his second term the players will probably remain essentially unchanged , at least for the first year . But several key advisers are vying for position . <P> Reagan 's aides are divided into two camps . The True Believers-White House Counsellor Ed Meese , Interior Secretary and former National Security Adviser William Clark , Treasury Secretary Donald Regan and Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger-want to continue pressing a hard line against Communism and giving free rein to supply-side economics . The Pragmatists-White House Chief of Staff James A. Baker , Deputy Chief Michael Deaver , Presidential Aide Richard Darman , Budget Director David Stockman and Secretary of State George Shultz-see the top priorities as reducing the deficit and reaching an arms-control accord with the Soviets . <P> With Meese probably heading off to become Attorney General , Baker will make a play to consolidate the Pragmatists ' control of the White House . This week he plans to ask Reagan to abolish Meese 's old Counsellor job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Believer into the spot . He is particularly eager to stop U.N . Ambassador Jeane Kirkpatrick from moving into a newly created role as counselor for foreign policy . Baker feels so strongly about this that if Reagan does not go along , he may submit his resignation . <P> The True Believers are already plotting to move Kirkpatrick into the post of National Security Adviser , now held by Robert ( " Bud " ) McFarlane . But Shultz is opposed to such a switch . He regards Kirkpatrick as too hard-line and erratic . He would prefer to retain McFarlane , who is an ally and has a low profile . Shultz may get his wish . A close friend of Reagan 's says , " I see the President relying on McFarlane more and more . I do n't think Bud is going anywhere . " <P> The key policy decisions of the next four years could turn on such maneuvering for Reagan 's ear . As in the past several years , the sharpest domestic debate will be over the federal deficit , and it will begin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
