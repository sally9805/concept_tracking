When a rising tide of refugees briefly provoked rioting in the city of Port Sudan three years ago , Sudanese President Gaafar Nimeiri came under mounting pressure from some members of his government to close his nation 's borders . Nimeiri would have none of it . During a climactic Cabinet meeting on the issue , he interrupted the debate and dramatically invoked the ancient Arab tradition of hospitality toward strangers . Said the President : " They are the guests of Sudan . " <P> To his credit , and possibly to his regret , Nimeiri has stuck by those words ever since . Even as the epic famine sweeping Ethiopia has increased the number of victims crossing into eastern Sudan to some 3,000 daily , Nimeiri has continued his nation 's traditional open-door policy . Yet despite a fast- building effort by local authorities and international relief agencies to provide food and shelter for the Ethiopians , the refugees are finding themselves in a nation that is almost as bereft of aid as the one they left . There are now about 1 million refugees in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the end of March , relief officials predict . The worsening plight of the region , says a spokesman for the United Nations High Commissioner of Refugees , is rapidly becoming " a disaster of major proportions . " <P> Nor is the refugees ' arrival the only major crisis confronting Sudan and its beleaguered President . Plagued by the same lack of rainfall and economic mismanagement that have devastated Ethiopia , up to a quarter of Sudan 's 21 million citizens are facing the threat of extreme hunger in the months ahead . In the southern part of the country , a rebellion waged by armed guerrillas against Nimeiri 's high-handed Islamic rule is growing , and the provincial capital of Juba is in danger of attack . Though Nimeiri had freed almost 300 of his jailed political enemies in December and January , just over a week ago he publicly hanged one of his more persistent adversaries . Known as a wily survivor over almost 15 years of rule , Nimeiri has never before faced such a formidable array of challenges . <P> One of his trickiest political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jews , called Falashas ( the Amharic word for strangers ) . The remnants of an ancient tribe that has kept alive Jewish religious practices , these Ethiopians became the object of a secret evacuation by Israel , code-named Operation Moses . According to various estimates , between 3,000 and 7,000 of them reached Israel before word of the rescue operation leaked out . Nimeiri , whose government is a member of the Arab League and has no diplomatic relations with Israel , was embarrassed by the spotlight on Sudanese cooperation in the resettlement and ordered the airlift cut off . That left several thousand Falashas still in Sudan , many with relatives already in Israel .
