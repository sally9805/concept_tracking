When the Urban Mass Transportation Administration began planning the " bus of the future " in 1970 , designers were full of ideas . The new bus would be attractive , roomy , comfortable - and low enough for the handicapped and elderly to board without difficulty . Flxible and General Motors came up with prototypes in 1973 . With an eye toward saving fuel , the UMTA sent them back to the drawing board with an offer to pay $3 per bus for each pound they could remove from the vehicle 's weight . In 1977 GM devised the RTS ill , a flashy bus with clean lines and an optional 1 wheelchair lift . Grumman , the company that built o the lunar landing module , bought Flxible and produced a low-slung , 26,000-lb. , 48-seat bus , com-Splete with a kneeling mechanism for the handicapped and an electric sign that beamed HAVE A GOOD DAY .

But the cities should have been suspicious of the Flxible 870 . After all , that missing e happened to stand for elasticity . Atlanta ordered the first Flxibles-134 at about $95,000 each-and defects , from faulty air conditioning to rickety engine mounts , have kept the maintenance department working overtime ever since . But the real shocker came in New York , the city of killer potholes . New York 's Flxibles began rolling in time for last summer 's Democratic National Convention , and quickly became known-for their darkly tinted , malevolent-looking fronts-as Darth Vader buses . They also won immediate notoriety for breaking down . By December the city had to take all 637 of its new buses out of service because of cracks in the supporting A-frames . <P> Grumman began dispatching repair crews throughout the country . New York had to lease 150 old buses from Washington . Chicago replaced 205 Flxibles with 100 old school buses . In Houston , where only about 275 of 475 Flxibles work on a given day , route expansion had to be halted .

The repair process , once it is perfected , will take 36 hours . Grumman has set aside $7 million for the project .
