WOBEGON DAYS " The city of New Albion was owned and laid out by a company of energetic men from Boston , principally Mr. Benjamin Bayfield , who has now turned his energies to the lumbering business elsewhere , " Mr. Getchell wrote home to his brother in Milford , Maine . " It is a thriving and very refined community where King Alcohol has yet to rear his terrible head , and growing like a house afire . Every day newcomers arrive and the next day they have established an address  --  that is pioneering : move your family and belongings onto the ground and build the walls around them . I am very pleasantly situated in my house made of logs hewed , two storys high , with a parlor in front and kitchen back and all the rooms papered and carpeted , in which parlor the City Council meets once a month , of which I have been elected the president . The state of things is prosperous at present  --  indeed , all are getting rich at a rapid rate and think nothing of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The price of farm land rises by leaps and bounds and town lots too , of which I have purchased seven at $500 each for the small sum of $70 , which is the first year 's interest on the mortgage and which I hope to sell within six months and become a creditor myself . Meantimes , I must find a livelihood , however , as I do n't have ready cash on hand and am considering using two of the lots as security to purchase a half-interest in the newspaper . " The town 's main industry appears to have been speculation , judgingfrom feverish articles in the Star that predicted the imminent arrival of the St. Paul &; Manitoba railroad and great fortunes for all . The town was mortgaged to the hilt ; by 1856 , six thousand lots were owned by two hundred forty-seven persons , most of whom , while practicing a trade temporarily , were really in the business of waiting  --  waiting for the railroad to appear on the horizon and buy right-ofway ( along the obvious practical route from the south , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deliver carloads of innocents to drive up the value of land . ( Unbeknownst to them , the first-comer , Mr. Bayfield , already had sold off the New Albion Land Company , after first issuing three thousand new shares , and by 1856 , his sole interest in town was a four-room house , empty except for a spinet in the parlor , still in its crate . ) " This is a strange place , " wrote Mr. Getchell 's brother , who40NEW ALBIONspent two months in New Albion in the spring of 1856 , to his wife in Milford . Tom will hear of nothing but future prosperity , but one 's view of the future depends on how deeply one is in debt  --  to him , who holds a ream of paper elegantly engraved in gold and giving him title to acres of mud and weeds , New Albion is at the verge of triumph , and to myself who am free and clear , it is not so much a City as a trance , a whimsey built on a swamp , a steeple waiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silk hat . In the public room of the Albion House , such men spend their afternoons in languid conversation about this and that , the RepublicanParty , the Kansas question , the writings of Whittier and Mrs. Stowe and Howell 's Prometheus , ' Unitarianism , and the Individuality of Experience and the Nature of the Soul and the Moons of Neptune , and what work is accomplished is done by , at most , a dozen hands , and that not always of an enduring nature  --  for example , a board-walk laid yesterday and today capsized in the mud . It is a City ' of leaning fences and mishung doors , of buildings begun and then forgot , of handsome unpaintedhouses , of timid little shops huddling behind magnificentfacades . Scenes of squalor so long associated with drunkards , you will find here , the population being intoxicated by dreams of easy income . No common labor for them ! No thrift  --  they are financially embarrassed ' but do not blush ! To them , what is is not but is what shall be , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the middle of it. 41In this Parnassus of the prairie , the Rev. Dr. Watt was the leading citizen of his day , a cleric , scholar , poet , orator , and a man who , as someone said , " woke up each day and wrapped greatness like a cloak around him . On his daily constitutionals , Dr. Watt is impeded by neither mud nor livestock . Morning and evening , he sets forth on his accustomed round , prepared for magnificent and learned discourse . At the sight of an audience , even a solitary soul leaning against a fence or heading toward a privy , Dr. Watt will cross any street however miry and challenge oncoming horses or herds of swine in order to engageLAKE WOBEGON DAYS NEW ALBIONhis fellow man in scholarly exposition on the ideas of the day . Many are the citizens who have been thus engaged and , with little effort or expense on their part , profitably educated , for the Doctor is as unsparingof his wisdom as he is generous with his time .

The 4th day of rain and we are up to our knees in mire and a man ca n't cross the street but he may have to abandon his boots halfway across  --  this western soil , so highly advertised as an agricultural paradiso , is clay and loam in the exact proportion needed to make thick soup with only a little water needed  --  a day of dismal rain , mixed well by horse and wagon traffic , and a man is a prisoner in his house , surrounded by impassable swamp . An apt illustration of our spiritual condition here : hemmed in by despond &; despair , life churned up by mere commerce and society  --  rode last week to the end of the lake . A magnificent site . High ground , well drained . Firm , even when wet . Natural clearing on hill , view of water &; distant village . I am to speak to trustees again Wed . &; must make a clear &; strong argument . Perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his resignation so many times , the trustees of the college had come to expect it ; it was the first order of business at their meetings and was easily disposed of , since the price of his happiness was low . A little praise from them and a little money for a bell for the college belfry , a few dozen library books , a professor of rhetoric , and the letter of resignation disappeared into his pocket . What sold them on the new campus that spring was the wonderful effect it would have on the value of land nearby . All conceivable lots had been sold at the townsite , and now , with the college moving to the eastern end of the lake , the land around the new campus could be divided into lots and put on the market . Their delay in approving the plan was to gain time to buy up surrounding property ; then they voted 5  --  2 to purchase a hundred acres from themselves for the college . The two opposed were gentlemen with no money to invest . So anxious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he hadcompleted a dedicatory ode before construction began , and on May 24 , 1855 , in the morning , the faculty ( four ) and students ( now swelled to twenty-five ) assembled in front of the lyceum , where the bell was placed on a wagon and , led by a small brass band and accompanied by half the citizenry , proceeded out the old Pender Road a mile and a half through what was then dense woods to its new abode on the hill . An account in the Minnesota Forward of June 16 included this description : The rain of the night before had left the air cool and sweet , and the cheerful singing of choirs of birds mingled pleasantly with the strains of drum and bugle , as our long caravan wound up hill and down , o'ertowered by stands of oak through whose branches the sun shone as a blessing . One could not but feel the College had embarked on a venture of such magnificence that Nature herself rejoiced to see it . Soon a chorus of shouts was heard from the vanguard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lake lay before us beyond the brow of the hill . The bell was gently lifted to the place of honor on the sturdy platformconstructed for the day 's ceremonies . The first building will be raised on this spot .... Following the dedicatory ode of Dr. Watt , the college hymn was sung as the bell was softly tapped with a mallet . In September , thirty-six students enrolled at Albion , arriving for fall term to find the main building completed except for the interior work  --  an imposing brick edifice nevertheless . The first floor was given over to a large chapel and a gallery for paintings and sculpture , the second to the college offices , a lecture hall , and two spacious classrooms . Unfortunately , a large sum of money that had been promisedby an Eastern benefactor did not materialize , and so there was no dormitory or dining hall . Meals were taken in the gallery , which were simple meals pending the arrival of a cookstove , and the student body spent the first three weeks of the term constructing two log bunkhouses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr , F. B. Reithman , professor of moral psychology , supervised the project , while writing to his brother in Philadelphia : LAKE WOBEGON DAYS NEW ALBIONOur president is occupied with making great plans for us , and we are busy making a place to sleep before winter comes on . The morale of the students is very fine and would be even better were it not for daily chapel , which lasts upward of an hour . With little by way of tools , they are accomplishing heroic things worthy of Napoleon 's army . Finished a cabin of four rooms for Dr. and Mrs. Watt last week , and now we are en- gaged on a structure sixty by twenty feet , one of two that will be student quarters , God willing , if our hands do n't peel off . Send gloves , if you can , and some salve . The faculty , consisting of Mr. Reithman , Mr. Waite , and Mr. Coutts , bedded down in the attic of Main , and by the middle of October , the most urgent construction completed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Carlyle House ) , they set about teaching . The course of studies comprised Classics , Theology , and Commercial : under Classics appeared Latin , Greek , Rhetoric , Po- etry , and Oratory ; under Theology were Moral Psychology , Old and New Testaments , Ecclesiastical History , and Science ; and under Com- mercial , Arithmetic , Penmanship , Bookkeeping , and Hygienics . Mrs. Watt offered lessons in music , and manual training was available any- where on the campus . The fee was $i8 per term for tuition and board , plus twenty hours of labor per week  --  in the afternoons and on Satur- days , the students threw themselves upon the immense unfinished tasks of the college , including : Felling four acres of timber and hauling the logs to town to be milled . Clearing two acres of tree stumps so a garden could be planted in the spring . Planting fifty apple trees . Digging a well . Digging deep pits and building privies . Cutting and splitting fifty cords of firewood . Raising a flagpole . Raising a cross . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the Watts ' cabin . The work was interrupted by a tragedy October i i when Frank Sutton was struck down and crushed by a tree . Apparently , he had cut it , then lost his footing on the slope as he attempted to run . He was 44 alone in the woods when this happened , and his body lay for sev era hours before it was discovered by the science class ; meanwhile a wile beast had chewed off one arm and carried it away . The body wa returned to Minar 's Grove for interment , and a memorial service helc at the college the Sunday following . Dr. Watt inspected the work daily . He devoted his chapel sermon to the topic of building , comparing the students to the children o Israel who were delivered out of captivity in Egypt and came into thi promised land of Canaan , comparing the work to the building of th ( temple under Solomon , leaving the students to figure out who wa : Solomon in the analogy . In his journal , he complained of shortness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am too heavy , " but the rapic progress of the college excited him : We are working a miracle here ! Every day shows us some new success as our vision takes form  --  a wall rises , then four , doors and windows appear , a roof rises , a handsome building stands where once was only leaf and shadow  --  this amazes &; inspires me to watch it ! I walk around &; am filled with new visions , dreams , ideas &c.; of a great University that shall someday stand on this hill to rival any on the planet . I dare not speak these dreams to any person  --  any sensible man would laugh uproariouslyat such a notion ! but then no " sensible " man could have accomplished here what we have done . This College is the one great work of my life . May God grant me a humble spirit to give all thanks to Him for bringing me to this place . He decided to hold another grand occasion to celebrate the greal work that had been brought so far , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fever and spent two days shut in his office writing an address . He called it Founders Day , October 30 , and invited everyonc he could think of , of whom some two hundred attended , including Mr. Hayfield , who was in the area foreclosing . The Forward wrote : Approaching New Albion College from the east , the writer gained the crest of a hill crowned with blazing oak and gaudy maple and , upon glimpsing the distant campus through the trees , stopped the team so as to impress the agreeable vista onLAKE WOBEGON DAYS NEW ALBIONhis memory , for against Nature 's dying ostentation , New Al- bion unfolds a seemly tableau of such simple unaffected gran- deur as to appear imagined , an apparition of Academe in the desolate forest , with its trim and handsome cottages , the well- laid walks and promenades , the orderly plantings of ornamental trees , and , bestriding all , the majestic spire of Main itself like an upraised finger calling all to stand in hushed wonder at what Providence had wrought . . . . Notable citizens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attendance to gaze upon the marvel for themselves , and those who admire the art of oratory found it in abundant supply . Two-thirty P.M. , October 30 , was perhaps the high-water mark of Henry 's life , for which the previous thirty-eight years had been re- hearsal , when Mr. Bayfield spoke a few words of introduction to the crowd and Henry arose in his voluminous black gown , took his place before the fresh oak lectern on the porch of Main , placed his right hand in the gown between the third and fourth buttons and stretched out his left in the hortatory position , glanced down at his two-pound address , and lobbed the first sentence out toward the woods . Under- foot he felt solid white pine planks , behind him was solid brick rising to a spire from which a bell would toll when he sat down , and before him lay a yard something like he had known at Harvard , with grass and little trees trimmed to make perfect globes . And his audience , too , of course : two rows of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Governor Alexander Ramsey , Honorable Thaddeus Browne , the steamboat titan , Honorable Charles F. Peabody and Honorable Horatio Parker of the New Albion Land Company , Honorable Al- drich Bryant , Honorable Emerson Fremont , Honorable James Knox , Bishop Upton of the Methodist Church , and behind them , students and New Albion citizens in solid ranks , leaning forward to catch his voice . For several nights running Henry had had bad dreams , dutifully recorded in his journal ( " Night sweats . . . lost in woods , running , terrible darkness &; sounds of crashing &; tearing . . . figures rising up from behind rocks &; my own voice weeping &; pleading . . . awoke exhausted &; lay awake until dawn " ) , which he attributed to nervous- ness , but he was himself now as he warmed up to his address  --  a true physical feat , speaking outdoors , it demanded a stout man to sustain 46 the force and trajectory to carry the vowels in full cry to the farthest listener , and he was not helped by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home , reported , " I crept away into the woods after an hour and his voice followed me there . I walked over the first hill and stood in a rocky ravine and put my arm around a tree and still Dr. Watt was there ; the very rocks seemed to ring , and even the tree trembled to our president 's peroration .

" He then saw flames from the college and ran to investigate . It was the flames of four bonfires burning on the shore , one for each class , the students racing to fetch wood to make their fire burn the brightest . Bitter weather set in on November 14 , a heavy wet snow in the morning , driven by a stiff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be seen from the Watts ' cabin or from the bunkhouses by the lake . The blizzard did not abate all night , and by morning the bunkhouses , both Emerson and Carlyle , were buried , sheets of snow sweeping across the lake to make six-foot drifts , and so were some students , the snow having blown through the cracks and drifted onto the blankets . Emerson suffered two broken windows and was half full of snow and so cold that the residents emigrated to Carlyle during a lull in the storm and spent the next night there , two and three boys to a bed . They had no food the first day and did n't dare venture up the hill in that blinding white , so dazzling that four feet from the door they saw nothing . " We 're going to die , " said one boy . The others told him that help would arrive soon , and then they decided to play dead when help did come . They posted a lookout and practiced being dead , lying in grotesque poses as they imagined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with heads hanging and mouths open , sprawled on the floor and one arm reaching toward the door , curled in a ball , crumpled and broken , as if death had flung them against the wall , seated and slumped forward and a hand grasping a pencil and a few lines of farewell letter ending with a long descending stroke as the writer perished . They practiced so they could do a good death scene in three seconds after the lookout 's " Go ! " and imagined Mr. Reithman'sreaction when he shoved the door open and looked upon this carnage of the storm . The tragedy ! The poor boys , innocent boys , the fragile flame of life snuffed out suddenly and so much candle left ! 48NEW ALBIONThen , of course , they would all jump up and yell at him , but some boys let their imaginations skip over that and go on to the next part : the long trip home in a box , the weeping family , the funeral where so many would shed bitter tears of remorse for not having done better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brother and friend . " The stove ! We have to let the fire go out ! He 'll know it 's a joke if he opens the door and the cabin 's warm ! " Some argued that , no , you can die in a warm room , suffocate from poison gases given off by stoves , but of course he might not think of that , so they let the fire go out , and then as the chill quickly came over them and an hour passed and no Reithman came , they gave up the idea and started up the fire . It was dark now . The boys whose idea death had been were now talking about sending a messenger to the College . After some debate , on the afternoon of the second day , they voted to send Weiss . He was the only volunteer . They gave him one end of a ball of twine and out he went , the wind so strong he could hardly stand . He fought his way uphill , missed the path and had to struggle through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the string tore from his mitted hand , and he panicked , broke into a gallop , ran into the gale so fierce he could n't hear himself scream , ran , fell , ran again , hit a tree , and finally ran full tilt into the porch of Main , which caught him at the knees , and dragged himself to the door and crawled in . He lay on the floor , too tired to move . He noticed the strange light in the cold chapel , as if he were underwater , a luminous predawn light , and saw a faint corona around the window above the pulpit . And then he heard breathing that was not his own , and stood up , and saw the bear sitting in the doorway to the gallery , and he turned away and fouled his pants and sat down . The bear made no movement toward him and made no sound except for its breathing , which was rough like the rasp of sandpaper . Spit fell from its mouth and froze into a pale milky beard . Its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bear , or seemed so to him who had never seen a bear , and staring at it , he could not move where he sat , not even to scratch his nose . The bear seemed to hold him in the power of its evil gaze and in the musky odor of bear . He sat , thinking no thought but that his death was close at hand. 49LAKE WOBEGON DAYS NEW ALBION In Carlyle , when the twine went slack , the students knew he was lost and would die . Some started to go after him and had to be held back by classmates ; others stood a few feet outside the door and shouted and shouted his name , " Weiss ! Weiss ! " The wind was so strong they could n't see their hands in front of their faces . Still , they took turns calling to him and whistling and clapping and beating on the eaves with a board , and others knelt in the long dark hall and wept and prayed for him , even after night fell and after they had crawled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and one would open the door and shout , long into the night . The morning of the third day , they woke up and saw the storm had blown itself out . They wasted no time ; all piled out the door and climbed single-file up the path through drifts five and six feet high and broke into the chapel and found him under the pulpit , wrapped in a drape he had torn off the wall , half-frozen , wide-awake , and he told them about the bear . When they did n't believe him , he showed them his pants . On December to , the question of foreign immigration was debated by members of the Phileopolis club , the affirmative team winning 12-7 , nineteen students being all who remained , the others having left . The bear in the chapel had frightened everybody , and then the bear did n't go away even after they set off rockets and blew a bugle and banged on a drum . Its tracks were found outside Dr. Watt 's house , then on the lawn by Main , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to withdraw from the College , one by one , two by two , hauling their trunks to the road to hail a ride to Little Falls and the daily coach to St. Paul . Even Dr. Watt could not stop them . After the first visita- tion , after paths had been shoveled and the supply of firewood replen- ished , Dr. Watt spoke at morning chapel a marathon sermon that left his congregation as weak as if they had spent the time struggling through snowdrifts . " His opening prayer consumed twenty-six min- utes , " Mr. Reithman noted , " and touched on many points of Old Testament history . " Though they did n't know it , it was a desperate Henry who faced them . His wife had announced at the height of the storm her intention to return to Boston . She had announced this several times before and in better weather , and now she announced it finally and asked him for five hundred dollars . She had suffered , she said , from his neglect . He was silent around her ; he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the fire . Outside their home , she said , he was voluble and manly and kept a cheerful disposition , but once in the door , he collapsed into a dark and impenetrable mood , and whenever she spoke , he did n't respond . He did not respond to her affections , he did not appear to recognize her . " How can you be so generous with others , even utter strangers , and here in your house with your own wife be so cold , so removed ? " she wondered . " Your better nature you show to the world , and your dark nature you show to me and to me alone ! All I see is darkness and brooding and silence . Have you no love left for me ? " She stood over him as she spoke , and he could n't look at her . He said nothing . She wept , she knelt and touched his knee , then her voice turned quiet and resolute and she demanded the moneyallthis without a word from Henry . Dr. Watt 's sermon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it proceeded to other suffering of those faithful to Him , of Stephen and other apostles and martyrs , and it went back to the prophets and their foreknowledge of that suffering , and to the Psalmist and the Children of Israel and to Job , and here Dr. Watt himself was exhausted but he beat on and began to talk about the bear as a messenger of God . God uses animals to work His Will , sometimes happily as with the dove of Noah and the birds who fed Elijah and the lions who proved Daniel 's faith and the swine who received the demons cast out , but also as instruments of judgment as in the case of the bear who came out of the woods to devour the children who mocked God 's servant Elisha for his baldness . As he delved into Elisha 's career , it became terribly evident to all that the President , now freed from his text and moving away from the pulpit and into the aisle and bracing himself with one hand against pew after pew and speaking thunderously , considered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those children who had mocked him in their hearts , to whom God had sent the bear as punishment . He could n't stop himself . He recited his many efforts in their behalf , his dedication , his hard work , and their offenses , their indolence , their unworthiness . " Why ? " he shouted . " Why ? Why has thou forsaken me ? " Nobody made an attempt to stop him . Everyone in the room was making his own plan for escape. co SILAKE WOBEGON DAYSFive boys left immediately after chapel with the father of one of them , who had come in a wagon with clean laundry . Dr. Watt did n't come out to say good-bye . That afternoon , fresh tracks were found by two students returning from cutting wood , and a band of five led by Mr. Reithman with a rifle marched off to find the beast 's den and to kill it . The bear was large and black , judging from the footprints and the tufts of hair found in bushes , and their long trek only determined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near as a hundred feet to Carlyle and Emerson , and that he had been joined by a second bear and perhaps a third . That night , a guard was posted in the belfry . " A sleepless night for all , " wrote Mr. Reithman , " due in some part to choruses of ursine snorts and growls which the wakeful addressed to those who slept , some of whom awoke to find tufts of bear fur on their pillows . " Mrs. Watt left on the 13th to spend Christmas with friends in St. Paul , four boys leaving with her . Dr. Watt explained to Mr. Reithman that she was nervous and preoccupied due to lack of feminine company , and he was sending her away lest she lose her senses . Mrs. Watt handed Mr. Reithman a note as he helped her into the sleigh . The note begged him to pray for her and to put food out for the bear . Instead , a trap baited with jelly and syrup was rigged close to the fresher circumference of tracks . It was found licked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A nearby tree showed deep claw marks to the height of ten feet . On the 15th , Dr. Watt announced in chapel that Christmas vacation would be spent at the College in academic pursuits . Six boys left on foot in the afternoon , leaving baggage behind and a student body of four souls : Borden , Smith , Godfrey , and Weiss . The four " are in a desperate state , afraid to disobey , afraid to remain , " wrote Mr. Reithmanin his journal . " They enrolled here expecting much and are reluctant to abandon ship , though I have argued with them . I believe they trust me too much and think that matters will improve so long as I remain . God help me . I must go and take them with me . Our President is crazed . " He told Dr. Watt that the College must be closed . Dr. Watt replied that he would sooner kill himself . " It is no time to be giving in to fear , " he cried . " This institution is the only one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any sympathetic soul ! If we retreat now , sir , we permit ignorance to stand unchallenged for years to come ! " On the afternoon of the 18th , shots were heard from the woods and shouts  --  a Mr. Slocum from town ran out from the trees and yelled to the lookout , " I have killed him ! " They followed him back the way he had come and found the bear humped in a pile as if he had tried to gather himself for one last leap . His blood lay steaming on the snow , bright red , a great burst of it . Mr. Slocum took the skin for himself and four big steaks . He hacked off the head and said he would come back for it . Four boys and Mr. Reithman put the rest of the meat on a sled and hauled it to Main , and that night they ate a good part of it themselves  --  Dr. Watt said he had no stomach for bear  --  roasting it over an open fire , a feast that got livelier as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fingers half-cooked bear meat and sang song after song , and piled more wood on the fire , until the flames nearly reached the treetops . They piled every stick of wood they could find on the fire and went off for more , and evidently that was when the second bear attacked . Two boys , Emmett Borden and Alton Smith , had found a fallen birch and were carrying it back toward the bonfire when they heard crashing behind them and dropped their load and ran . The bear pursuedand caught them just short of the fire , where a third boy , Miles Godfrey , watched in horror . Emmett was bit in the throat and perished on the spot . Alton , a brilliant student who later embarked on a distinguishedcareer in public life , suffered gashes on the chest and shoulders from the animal 's trying to drag him away , and bore scars to the day of his death in 1908 .

Mr. Weiss was not present , having gone to bed . Mr. Reithman obtained a new position at Carleton College in Northfield and taught there for fifteen more years until his untimely death in a boating accident . Mr. Weiss remained at Albion College until the spring , his mind unhinged , and had to be removed to the state asylum at St. Peter , where he lived until his decease , the date of which is not known . S3LAKE WOBEGON DAYS I NEW ALBIONThe winter of the bears ushered in the Panic of 1857 , when Minnesota Life Insurance &; Trust Company gravely and gracefully crashed and banks in St. Paul stopped dealing in legal tender ; when the investors of the New Albion Land Company opened the treasurer 's strongbox and found dried grass , some gravel , and a few feathers ; and when every piece of paper held by New Albion speculators became a piece of paper . Deflation was followed by a plague of dysentery . The grasshopperscame in August , from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 7th , the sky turning black with bugs on the 12th . Those who had scorned speculation in favor of honest labor now found their crops destroyed by the infestation . That August , the poet Putnam wrote : Were I a bird , a winged bird , And sped the airy regions through , I would fly to the east where comes the light , Land of the Pilgrims ' godly might , Land of the good and true , Far from this prairie vast and dry Where clouds of locusts from on high Blacken the dreary land and sky . No song we hear , no sun we see For clamor of insect gluttony  --  Blasting our crops and fields beneath The whining onslaught of their teeth , Blasting our hopes and pleasures , too , This darkest hour of the night . O had I wings on which to flee , I 'd bid the wretched west Adieu , Fly Bostonward  --  O blessed sight ! Were I a winged bird .

The Putnams went south to St. Louis , where she had friends in the theater . S4About half of the residents had left New Albion by 1858 , the year that Minnesota achieved statehood , including Dr. Watt . His last act as President was a letter to a Mr. Waters who had applied to him for a teaching job . New Albion , Minn . Jan. 18 , 1858Mr . W.H. WatersSt . Paul , Minn . Dear Sir : Your favor of 2nd ints. was duly received , requesting information concerning your obtaining a position with New Albion College as an instructor of moral theology .

We are only sorry to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hereabouts by wild bears struck terror into our ranks and emasculated our numbers , hence we are unable to offer employment .

With best wishes for success and prosperity . Very truly yours , Henry Francis Watt , Ph.D . Evidently , Dr. Watt did make the trip to Boston , because it was there that he died in April , of a seizure , in a hotel room , following a dinner with prospective backers . When he failed to return to New Albion , the trustees of the College voted to suspend operations until the fall , and in the fall , when no students appeared ( they had heard the College had closed ) , the College closed for good , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few years later , after a fire destroyed the Main building , the land was bought by a Mr. Moore who built a barn on theSS LAKE WOBEGON DAYS I NEW ALBIONold foundations and used the remaining structures for storage . The great bell had fallen in the fire and Mr. Moore was able to raise it just enough to turn it upside down to where it could be used to water livestock . " The year 1857 will be remembered as the year when all false hope was lost , " wrote Mr. Getchell sadly to his brother in Maine . " So much is gone that once we could not live without , and yet we do live somehow and even sometimes think hopefully of to- morrow . " The railroad took its sweet time arriving . The Northern Pacific reached St. Cloud and continued north along the Mississippi to Little Falls , and the Great Northern swung west through St. Joseph , Avon , Albany , and Freeport , while the Soo Line ran northeast from Albany to just south of Little Falls , the three lines making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bribes were paid to railroad officials , of course , but other towns paid bigger ones . The handsome depot built to lure the lines sat empty and its platform opened onto a field of alfalfa where a tiny sign on a pole stood , which said " W. " The town board sent monthly petitions to St. Paul , and a delegation attended every grand opening of new track for miles around , of which there were many . Each of the major railroads had a ceremonial train known as a " jacker " with a flatcar for a band , two or three coaches for the guests , and a palatial parlor car to haul the dignitaries , and when the line reached a town or a spot where the railroad intended to promote a town , the special train was run out for the day for speeches , music , and the driving of a special spike , usually brass . The Albion delegation lobbied hard at these occasions , carrying a satin banner emblazoned " New Albion  --  Gateway To Central Minnesota , " not knowing that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little influence who had time on their hands and enjoyed sitting on platforms for a small per diem . Years later , Jonson Ingqvist visited the abandoned Great Northern building on Market Street in St. Paul , looking for a good used desk , and found in a pile of rubbish on the fourth floor a file marked " Al- bion " containing letters from the town promoting itself as a rail center . The file was marked : " Error  --  no such appears on map  --  must mean Albany . " Albany , to the south of New Albion , was on the main G.N. line . The ultimate connection of the town , in 1885 , with the so-called " Lake Wobegon spur , " was a mistake on the railroad 's part , a sidingthat took a sharp angle due to misplaced surveyors ' stakes and that kept going for sixteen miles in an attempt to find its way back to the main line . When the track crew reached New Albion , which was not on their map and which at any rate was now called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cloud by horse-drawn wagon , leaving the track where it is today , a quarter-mile south of town , ending in thick brush by the depot . ( The depot was moved south on skids to reach the end of the line . ) A district superintendent was fired for his negligence ; the spur appears on G.N. maps as a dotted line marked " See Code , " but there is no code . The company nonetheless began regular shipping over the spur that year , which continued until 1965 . Passenger servicewas always by petition , fifty names being required due to the inconvenience of the stop ( trains have to back in the full distance ) , and so was mostly limited to great occasions such as the Norwegian Tricentennial , the inauguration of Governor Burnquist , and Dan Patch 's running at the State Fair . In 1922 , the westbound Empire Builder entered the spur by mistake on June 4 , shortly before midnight , and raced toward Lake Wobegon carrying 432 passengers , including Rita Melitta , The Cream of Wheat Quartet , The Laughing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Boy Brigade series . The great train swept on toward its doom , its bar car blazing with light as the merrymakers danced in the aisle , until , a quarter-mile short of sure death , their lives were saved by a Holstein belonging to a farmer named Brown , which strolled onto the tracks . The engineer applied his brakes too late to save the cow but just in time to stop the train at the station , where he noticed , a few yards ahead , the two rails end . The passengers disembarkedfor a few minutes while a trainman ran to find out where they were . No lights appeared in town , everyone had turned in . " Who would want to live in a burg as dead as this ? " remarked Rita Melitta , LAKE WOBEGON DAYSnot knowing that Mr. Lundberg the undertaker had nearly received her business that night . A few months later , the train carrying the Sorbasol All-Star barnstormingteam backed into town , carrying Babe Ruth , Walter Johnson , Long George Kelly , and Wild Man Ringsak , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 17  --  5 score . The first primary school in Mist County ( aside from the singing school run by Madame Putnam ) was taught by Miss Emily Chase ( later Mrs. Getchell ) the winter of 1853-54 , a private school kept in a boarding house run by a Mr. Charles Church which later was discovered to be a tavern . The next winter there was no school , and in the summer of 1855 Mr. Bayfield 's empty house was pressed into service , twenty-six pupils attending , run by Miss Ida J. Packard who was all of sixteen and was hard put to keep order . Early in November 1856 , a regular schoolhouse was built on Van Buren ( now McKinley ) next to the Albion Shoe Company , and some forty-five pupils enrolled underMr . Sewell W. Smiley , whose brother Newell was in the shoe business . Miscreants were sent to him and put to work scraping cowhide in the cellar , where , it was said , the vapors from the curing vats were strong enough to destroy human hair and where , some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pairs of ladies ' boots from a 14-year-old boy . The school year passed without incident . The first county superintendent of schools appears to have been Dr. Tuttle , who served from 186o until his death in 1874 . A fourroomschoolhouse was built in 1866 on Maple , and the Van Buren school was moved to Taylor Street , where it was used for storage by Shaw &; Getchell  --  or else the new school was built on Taylor and the Van Buren school was moved to Maple , in which case it is the building that burned in 1871  --  no one is quite certain on this point . Some tend to believe the latter , since Shaw &; Getchell were out of business by then , though Mr. Shaw himself still operated a couple wagons for hire and might have needed storage facilities  --  and yet , if the Van Buren school was moved to Taylor , how does one explainNEW ALBIONthe building in the 187o photograph labeled " Old School , " which stood next to the Congregational Church and which , judging from the children hanging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than storage ? On the other hand , the structure on Maple that burned the following year is described in some accounts as " abandoned " ? Is it possible that the " Van Buren " school was actually built on Taylor and then moved to Van Buren ( where the Congregational Church stood ) after the Maple school was built and before the fire destroyed the Shaw &; Getchell warehouse ( abandoned because they had gone out of business ) ? Or  --  and I lean toward this theory  --  was there a third schoolhouse involved , one that was known as " Old School " and which was not adjacent to the church ( a thin white line appears between the two in the photograph ) but which remained on Van Buren ( on the corner with Maple ) ? That would leave two other buildings , one to be a warehouse and the other to burn . In any case , the abandoned New Albion College ( the building in town ) was taken over by the school district in 1882 ( the year after a fire damaged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on McKinley ( formerly Van Buren ) and is used as a warehouse . The first person to be killed by a white man in the New Albion area was the French-Canadian voyageur named Tourtelotte , struck on the head with a paddle by Boule Simmcon in 1742 as they entered the lake after a long day going upstream on the Malheur River and saw they had followed the wrong branch of the Sauk . Authorities at the Hudson 's Bay Company headquarters in Grand Portage ruled that the homicide was justifiable  --  Tourtelotte was known as a man who always took the bow position in the canoe and used a sweep-stroke that achieved little propulsion while splashing the man in the stern  --  and anyway Simmcon had suffered enough from the victim 's company . " M. Tourtelotte knew but two Voyageur 's Songs and of those only the Choruses , " said the inquest report , " and made of them such a Constant Clangour as to propagate Dread and effect a Shew of Force . " A man was shot in New Albion on election day in 186o @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made his loyalty evident and might have been a Republican , but the Republican who shot him was taking no chances . He was held in the town jail but was released to join the Army , which he did , and died at Antietam . In April 1861 , Robert Wise , visiting his uncle , Mr. Tripp , was killed by a trapper named Bowers who thought the young man had stolen his furs and who was wrong about that and felt remorse and hung himself in his cell ; he was acquitted by the jury on account of his death . On December 24 , 1868 , at a dance at the New Albion House , a man was stabbed and killed who was not the man the assailant intended to kill , the man who had given an expensive brooch to a woman nearby , but the man standing next to him . The murderer served several years at the penitentiary in Stillwater . The woman had been betrothed to the murderer . She married the man who gave her the gift and they removed to Minneapolis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and killed in his field by a neighbor , Azariah Frost , whose son David had married Mr. Daly 's daughter Maud two years before ; Frost then returned home and killed himself . On a Sunday evening in May 188o , persons came to the window of the Shaw residence while members of the family were eating supper and fired a Winchester rifle and a shotgun loaded with buckshot , killing Mr. Horace Shaw and his young son , Charles , while severely injuring Mrs. Shaw who was pierced by several bullets but survived in a crippled condition . Two daughters , Mary and Agnes Shaw , fifteen and seventeen years of age , had gone to the kitchen to cut a blueberry pie and were uninjured . A detective from St. Paul was called in on the case and , following up various clues , he put the finger on two men from St. Cloud who had been seen in the company of the Shaw girls at a dance only a week before the murders . The girls admitted to authorities that they had agreed with the young men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girls would inherit the house . Reprehensibleas the crime was , the girls were put on a train to Minneapolis to live with an aunt . The young men were tried for murder and found not guilty by the jury , which felt that the girls were equally culpable , whereupon a man named Conway shot and killed a juryman . He was never apprehended . The following August , a newborn child was found in a privy , and in October , the decomposed body of what appeared to be a young woman of wealth was found in a field during plowing . A string of pearls was around her neck , and the bones of her right hand clutcheda Bible . That winter , a man was stabbed and left to die in a ditch north of town . Nobody could identify the body . Mr. Thorvaldson offered a gravesite and a stone . The body was buried under the name " Oscar Thorvaldson , " though the deceased was no relation to him . Doctors came and went . Four had hung up their shingles in five years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One of them was all right if you believed in that sort of thing ( roots , mainly , and leaves ) , one was a drunk , one peddled snake oil , and the other did n't get much business , so there was no telling about him . A fifth man , Dr. Thompson , was good and left after the diphtheria epidemic of 1866 , his own health shattered . When Dr. Louis Holter , E.D.D. , set up shop in 1872 , the town had lost faith in the current officeholder , a Dr. Pfeiffer , who dispensed white powders and brown liquids that put his patients in a stupor . Once , after a massive outbreak of dysentery , he dosed them with a combination of the two , and half of New Albion lay flat on its back , seeing faces in the wallpaper . Dr. Holter brought the most advanced equipment of the day : an electrical chair , solid oak , with a crank in back that the physician turned to create magnetic energy that entered the body through wires and straps and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ field . The electrical chair , he instructed them , was no interventivemeasure to be called on when illness struck but rather a preventiveand restorative device , meant to be employed on a weekly basis . The patient would notice the benefits only after a serious and sustained program of treatment . The electrical chair produced a pleasant tingly sensation . One could actually feel things happening in the legs and up the spine , as negative power came into balance with positive , and the flow of6 , LAKE WOBEGON DAYSpositivity was redirected to and from the cranial extremity , making vibrations in the peepers and leading to tremendous benefits that one was already beginning to imagine . Word-of-mouth built Dr. Holter 's trade , and he took over the Albion House , which became the Holter Sanitarium . Three more electrical chairs were brought in and two trained magneticists to crank them , and by 1874 , upwards of a hundred persons were taking weekly sittings . The treatment was especially popular among the New Englanders , Dr. Holter being a Maine man . The Germans and Norwegians , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so their health was not affected . For the regular customer , the dosage of magnetism needed to make one feel things happen soon got to be quite a jolt , and then one noticed other things happening , such as headaches and fatigue . The doctor 's supporters grew pale and listless . One magneticist left and then anotheras trade declined , and finally Dr. Holter retired to Wyoming . Mr. Getchell was his last patient that day . He sat in the electrical chair , bound with straps and wound with wires , as the doctor cranked away , and for a moment , Mr. Getchell sensed that he was on the verge of feeling good again , and then he felt a numbness at the top of his head and briefly forgot his own name . When he stood up , he almost fainted . When he walked out the door , the town seemed dim , insubstantial , and filled with an ominous low hum . On the streets were strange people who spoke a foreign language . New Albion became Lake Wobegone in 188o , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Norwegians had gained a 4  --  3 majority . Then the City Council voted to become the Town Council . The New Englanders bitterly opposed both changes , arguing  --  even shouting  --  that they were undignified , unprogressive , and would make the town a laughingstock . " Woebegone means dismal , unhappy , dilapidated , bedraggled ! " they said . " You ca n't do this ! " The Norwegiansjust sat and smiled . To them , Wobegone was the name of the lake they loved and nothing more . They liked the sound of it . In 1882 , Lake Wobegone became New Albion again , Mr. FjeldeNEW ALBIONhaving lost his seat to Mr. Weeks by two votes . Mr. Fjelde got back on the Council two years later , and then it was Lake Wobegone again . State statute permits four name changes , after which a name is consideredpermanent and can be changed only by the legislature , so the Council changed it one more time , from Lake Wobegone to Lake Wobegon . Mr. Getchell resigned in protest and was replaced by Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away , however , not even those who favored the change , but used all their New Albion stock until it ran out . FOREBEARSThe oldest living Wobegonian , Mr. Henry Anderson , eighty-nine , is in a state of decline , and his memory of town history now includes such things as President Warren G. Harding living at the Sons of Knute temple and elephants in the woods and people running down the street after the Great Earthquake , so the oldest reliable memory may be Hjalmar Ingqvist 's , of his grandfather standing with an arm around an elm tree on a summer night singing " Til Norge In Sogn Or Rein " ( " To Norway in Sun or Rain " ) with tears running down his cheeks . He was sixty years away from Norway , still he sangO Norway , your rugged mountains and towering pines call to me though I have crossed the ocean never to return . O bird in the sky , fly quickly and tell all of my dear ones that my heart is filled with unspeakable love and sorrow . Homesickness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and it was not unusual , Hjalmar says , to see old people weep openlyFOREBEARSfor Norway or hear about old men so sad they took a bottle of whiskey up to the cemetery and lay down on the family grave and talked to the dead about home , the home in Norway , heavenly Norway . America was the land where they were old and sick , Norway where they were young and full of hopes  --  and much smarter , for you are never so smart again in a language learned in middle age nor so romantic or brave or kind . All the best of you is in the old tongue , but when you speak your best in America you become a yokel , a dumb Norskie , and when you speak English , an idiot . No wonder the oldtimersloved the places where the mother tongue was spoken , the Evangelical Lutheran Church , the Sons of Knute lodge , the tavern , where they could talk and cry and sing to their hearts ' content . O Norway , land of my childish fancies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seek comfort . O bird in the sky , tell me  --  do they remember me in the old home or am I a stranger wherever I roam ? Hjalmar was ten years old , the president of the fifth grade , and when his grandfather cried , Hjalmar got up and left the room . His father heard the old man out and said , " Well , Father , if you 're unhappy here , I will be happy to pay your fare back . " The old man sighed . He remembered the trip over . Fourteen days across the North Atlantic in heavy weather . Men , women , and children packed into dark rooms that stank like a stable . The room rolling , rising and falling . Everyone lay on wooden pallets . A girl from near his village in Trondheimfell ill the first day at sea . An old woman took one look and said , Mother , but the girl cried , No ! And died four days later in childbirth . The baby died too . They were buried at sea . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man 's mind that would be the voyage back . In America where he lived , he was dying , and the ship back to his true life in Norway was the ship of death . He would take that ship eventually . He was not ready to go just yet . Hjalmar 's father owned the majority interest in the Farmers ' Grain Elevator and Flour Mill , traveled regularly on business to Chicago , once spoke to William Howard Taft ( on the train , in English ) , and was a considerable man , not the sort to suddenly burst into tears for anotherLAKE WOBEGON DAYS I FOREBEARScountry . He spoke Norwegian only when spoken to . At seventeen , he had gone to work for Mr. Weeks who owned the elevator and mill , a gentleman who avoided the office whenever possible , preferring to stay home and read Emerson , and Jonson Ingqvist , left to his own , learned the business quickly . He was glad to run it and , in 1908 , after three years of poor crops , when Mr. Weeks panicked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a modest price , no cash in advance . There were rumors that Jonson had juggled the books . He said only , " Mr. Weeks read too much . He was n't so bad off as he thought . " Jonson outsmarted him in the English language , and he was proud of it . Mr. Weeks was foolish and lacked faith in the land and the farmers , and Jonson had faith , but he also had very good English and spoke it with little trace of an accent . He campaigned for English in the Lutheran church . " When we preach in Norwegian , we preach only to ourselves and to fewer and fewer of us , " he said . " This is no preaching , this is speaking in tongues ! " He believed that since they were in America , they should be Americans . ( " Of course , America had been good to him , " says Clarence Bunsen . " The rich can afford to be progressive . Poor people have reason to be afraid of the future . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sacks . ) When Birgit Tollefson , Hjalmar 's sister , moved back from Honolulu in 1964 after her husband died , she plunged into service for the Mist County Historical Society , gathering up old letters , papers , and other artifacts , doubling the Society 's collection in a year 's time , much to the displeasure of Mrs. Halvorson , who , before Birgit showed up , had been the Society . " We do n't have room for all that junk ! " Mrs. Halvorson complained to anyone who would listen to her . " She 's hauling in everybody 's attic ! I looked in one of those boxes and found ten pairs of ladies ' underwear ! Underwear , mind you ! Are we going to have a display of underwear ? Get a big glass case and fill it up with underwear ? Why not enema bottles and thunder jugs ? Why do n't we collect all the outhouses ? We could have forty or fifty of them , all in good workingorder ! " There was n't room for both of them in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pioneers , membership limited to de-66scendants of Norwegian families who settled in Lake Wobegon by 1895 , which neatly cut out Mrs. Halvorson , whose grandfather had come in 1896 . After Honolulu , Birgit 's Norwegian heritage appeared wonderful and exotic to her . " Marvelous , " she cried , holding up some old rosemalingpainting that had been on someone 's kitchen wall for fifty years . " Marvelous ! Incredible ! " Anything Norwegian held fascination for her : any antique that had been in Norwegian hands , old Norwegiannewspapers that she could not read , old family pictures held her spellbound for minutes , even pictures of families she had never known  --  they were Norwegian and that was all that mattered . For Syttende Mai of 1965 , the Daughters planned a procession to the cemetery , and the question arose : who should carry the flag ? The committee voted for an honor guard of seven Daughters whose ancestorshad arrived first , and the club archivist , Darlene Tollerud , set about looking through old letters and church records to see whose ancestors would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Luther Rognes , Darlene found a packet of letters written by Magnus Oleson to his family in Norway , which the family brought when they joined Magnus in the New World , and what was clearer than day in the letters was the fact that Magnus was not only the first arrival , he was also a deserter from General George McClellan 's army . Magnus , on reaching New York in 1861 , had accepted $200 from a man named West to take his place in the Army which Magnus understood would be for only a few weeks , and when he found that army life was brutal , the food was not fit for animals , the camp was full of sickness , the officers were cruel , and he , who scarcely spoke English , was being put in places where people shot at him , he decided it was no war for a Norwegian . His only good words were for General McClellan who did not push the army too hard to go into battle . That was fine with Magnus . He had written to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a war that he wanted no part of , and got no reply . " He does not care , he is a butcher and a barbarian , " Magnus wrote to his family . A few days later , he wrote again . He had stolen an officer 's horse and was in Kentucky . He went from there to Wisconsin and then to Minnesota , putting as much distance as possible between himself and67LAKE WOBEGON DAYS FOREBEARSthe fighting . He arrived in Lake Wobegon on the stolen horse in the summer of 1863 , about the time his regiment was being destroyed in the battle of Gettysburg . He bought land north of town where he lived all his life , dying in 1911 . He fathered eight children , two of whom died in infancy . The six others bore children of their own , and one way and another , the name of Magnus Oleson was in the family tree of almost every Norwegian in town .

If all of us had heroes for ancestors , then where would that leave us ? " She said it was a shock , that was all , and people would get over it in time . When Magnus arrived in 1863 from the bloody campaigns of the Union army , the town was still New Albion , the citizens were New England- ers , whom he called Woodmen  --  from the name of their lodge , The Mystical and Enlightened Order of Woodmen , and also from their appearance ; their faces looked like lumber . Nobody greeted him in Norwegian . He knew only enough English to ask for what he wanted . He got a job in the New Albion Mill shelling corn , which was done by walking horses over it , and boarded with a family named Watson , which treated him like a young and not very bright child . In a photo- graph of townspeople gathered at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a short figure in a white shirt whose face is blurred appears to the far right of the crowd of black suits ; it is assumed to be him . He appears to have only stopped in passing and then not to have stood still enough ; certainly his loyalty to Lincoln 's cause was very slight . He wrote home to Norway : Men will walk ten miles for a scrap of news about the war and then walk back and discuss it late into the evening . A newspaper from St. Paul or Chicago is a feast to them although it is full of lies . They are all strong for the Union here , having never fought for it or seen the bodies stacked like firewood . I lie in my bed and listen to them . Their voices sound like woodsaws ! Three veterans returned to New Albion of the twelve young men who left , including Albert Watson , who asked Magnus questions about his whereabouts the past few years . " It is a great advantage at times not to understand English , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to understand less than I do . " One night Albert arrived home late from a lyceum at which a Horatio Stevens had spoken on " The American Republic as a Movement Of Regeneration " and seized the young millhand by his leg and hauled him out of bed , but Albert was too weak to beat him . He sank to the floor exhausted . He was flushed and feverish . He was coming down with diphtheria . The diphtheria epidemic swept through New Albion in three horribleweeks of October 1865 , and devastated many families , killing thirty-seven children , eleven women , and four men , including Albert . Dr. Thompson drove himself to exhaustion , riding for miles into the country from bedside to bedside late into the night , dozing off in the buggy when his horse finally headed for home , awakening a few hours later with a new call for help , a new case , another frantic father at his door . There was little that a doctor could do .

All that month and for weeks after , New Albion was practically a ghost town . People were terrified of contagion and avoided any contact with their neighbors . What with his daily contact with the sick , Dr. Thompson was shunned by the well . His own wife and children left for St. Cloud , and when people there learned where they had come from , the family was told to move on to St. Paul . School was closed , of course , and church . Those merchants who still could stand retreated to a back room when customers came in . Any communication was shouted from a distance . Out in the country , men on their way to town stopped their teams fifty yards from an infected house and shouted , " Do you need anything ? " and if the inhabitants were strong enough to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  flour and pork , beans , coffee , maybe brandy , liniment , Dr. Clarke 's Oil of Arnica  --  and left it on a stump , but if the passerby heard nothing , he went on . Days passed before someone came out and looked in the house . LAKE WOBEGON DAYSThat someone was often Magnus , who was untouched by the disease , having encountered it in the army , and who devoted himself to burying the dead . He was offered money for this and after giving it thought he accepted it . The work was hard , and he was the only one who seemed up for it . The word came at night  --  a farmer stopped and shouted up at my window , and in the morning I hitched up the horse and drove out six miles across the fields where corn rots for lack of able bodies to pick it , arriving at the silent little house about ten o'clock . I knocked and heard a very slight scraping inside , the door opened slowly and a man who looked almost dead himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later he reappeared and with great difficulty opened the door wider and passed out to me the sad little bundle of his dead son wrapped in a piece of blanket . He did not weep for he was too sick , and I did not weep either for I have done this so many times . I carried the precious cargo to a grove of trees about thirty feet away where I had already dug the hole and placed the child in it and set to work . I prayed as I shoveled . There was not even time for a hymn ! I did not pray for the child 's soul , for of that I had no doubt that it was with the angels , but rather prayed that God would give me many children of my own . I would like to have twenty or thirty ! It was not until 1867 that the woman arrived from St. Paul to become his wife , and while he waited for her , he began to prosper a little . During the epidemic he did the work of six men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to foreman of the mill , the old foreman having left in a panic , and he bought a house in the woods about a half-mile from town for $30 , the former inhabitant having died of the disease . He carried all the furniture out of the house , piled it in the field , doused it with kerosene , and burned it : a featherbed and bedstead and black walnut dresser , a rocking chair , a fine oak table and two chairs , a sideboard , a divan , and much more  --  the deceased , a young man by the name of Ward , having been prosperous , though Magnus had never seen him work a day . He left behind a closetful of70FOREBEARSfine suits and white shirts , which Magnus also put to the torch . Only the two stoves remained . The house gave him fresh hope that the life he had longed for was soon to arrive . He walked through the rooms , a kitchen and front room and bedroom downstairs and two little bedrooms up under the eaves , and imagined them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a large bed . " It is not so beautiful to some perhaps , " he wrote to his cousin Bjorne , " but to me it is like a temple . Here someday my lonely existence will be filled with laughter . I hope that she is young and beautiful and all the children are loud and strong . " On May 15 , 1867 , sitting in the shade of a stone abutment at the mill , eating his lunch , he saw a party of four wagons and some men on horseback ride slowly down the hill into town . Even at a distance , something about them caught his eye , and he got up and walked in their direction , and then a word of Norwegian flew like a bird on the wind , and he began to run . He tore down the dusty street past the church to the square and leaped at the youth on the first horse and pulled him down and got him on the ground and hugged him . It was Oskar Tollefson , 16 , leading thirteen of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ migrated in hopes of resumingtheir livelihood as fishermen . Magnus went from one to the other , touching their faces , kissing the women , embracing the men , hoisting the three little children high in the air , and seeing how happy he was , not realizing it was on their account , they assumed this must be a fine home for Norwegians and fell to their knees and thanked God for bringing them here . Then he took them to his house and all of them lived there for a few weeks , during which he stopped talking only long enough to sleep and work . At last he could speak intelligently and with feeling ! About anything under the sun ! The Tollefson party 's misbegotten journey to Dakota was due to their own lack of English when they arrived in St. Paul in October aboard a train from New York . They managed to recover four pieces of baggage that had been marked for points west and got rooms for the night at a hotel and even bargained with a livery for wagons and horses , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what they were talking about. 71LAKE WOBEGON DAYS 1 FOREBEARS " I stood in the street in front of our lodging and watched for a kind and patient face , and when a man came along , I said , Please help me , ' and then tried to indicate by gesture what it was we were seeking , " Oskar wrote years later .

I indicated a fishing boat with two sets of oars and a small mainsail and indicated the nets and big fish in the nets and myself pulling them in , and then sailing home and the great happiness that awaited us on shore , and cleaning the fish , and eating them .

He led him to the end of the street and pointed up the hill to a train of Red River oxcarts just making their way over the crest , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indicated that he should follow them a great distance . The man also indicated that the carters were drunks and wild men , and that Oskar should keep his money on his person at all times . The trip north and west to Dakota took three weeks . The cart drivers were n't drunks ; they drank every drop of their whiskey the first night out and after that were cold sober . They were n't wild men , despite the brilliant sashes and beads they wore , and their impenetrable language , a mixture of French , Ojibway , and Gaelic , and the wrestling matches they put on at night , the singing and dancing , the coffee they drank that dropped Oskar to his knees . When it came to pressing forward , they were all business . The trail followed woodlines and rivers and led them through sloughs that looked impassable , but the carts plunged right in and the wagons followed , linked to each other by long leather straps . One day thick fog set in and the train never paused : the screeching of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miles , and nobody got lost . From settled country where little homestead shanties were planted three and four to the mile across the undulating prairie , they slowly moved into another country , not only unsettled but unsettling : absolutely flat , unbroken by a tree , flat as a table , straight to the horizon , like a dream , the earth stripped of scenery , of every feature by which one finds his way . Day after day the Norwegians searched the horizon for the mown- tains that must engirdle the great lake , and saw nothing ahead , this country went on forever , until one morning beyond Fort Abercrombie , the leader of the train approached them as they squatted around the breakfast fire drinking coffee , and said , " C'est la wiki wanki , laddies , " indicating with a sweep of his arm that they had come to the place where they wanted to go . It was n't the place at all ! They studied it as the carts pulled north and before the screeching had faded away , the Tollefson party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not know what would become of us in land so flat , " Oskar wrote . " We would become like dumb animals , oxen , or go crazy , and probably both . It was so far from where anyone else lived , and would anyone else ever come live there ? We certainly doubted it . " They reached the Fort and kept on , not seeing any land that looked quite right , feeling ashamed of themselves  --  pioneers who turned back !  --  until they reached the little town where the man rushed toward them , shouting " Ar du Norsk ? " They were glad to say " Ja ! " Besides Oskar , the members of the party were : his father and mother , Jens and Solveig , and brothers Thorstein and Jacob and little sister Nina ; Mrs. Tollefson 's brother , Olaf Tollerud , wife Drude , and son Paul ; a Mr. Hans Ager and a Mr. Waldemar Jaeger ; Mr. Jaeger 's sister and her husband , Luth and Eva Fjelde ; and an old man , J.

HE IS HONEST , hard-working , clean , in good health , has his own house and money in bank , and sincerely seeks a good woman for the purpose of matrimony . Norwegian pref . MagnusOleson , New Albion. 72 7 ? LAKE WOBEGON DAYSShe rode the St. Paul &; Pacific to St. Cloud where he met her , holding a placard with his name on it , and they went straight to a judge and then drove the long miles home in silence , arriving around sunup . The first thing she did was fix @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he did n't know much more than that . She was tall , strong , wide in the hips , had black hair that , unbraided , came to her waist , and looked to be about twenty . When she got off the train and spotted him , she put her hands over her face and wept , she was so afraid he 'd be angry with her . They had exchanged letters , and hers were written by her brother . She spoke no Norwegian and very little English . She spoke excellent German . " He ate his breakfast in silence , her watching his every bite , and tried to think what to do next , it had all happened so fast , " says Clarence Bunsen , a great-great-grandson . " She tried to look pleasant for his benefit but she was terrified because back in Germany the punishment for deceiving a suitor was pretty stiff , and she could n't tell him , of course , that it had been her brother 's doing . She must 've felt like a convicted criminal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it was God 's will that she came and it was up to him to take the next step , so what he did was get up from the table , clear it , and over her protest he washed the dishes . She 'd never seen a married man do that . It was his way of telling her how much he cared about her , being unable to say it . And then presumably they went up to bed . " The first Norwegians emigrated from Stavanger on the west coast , later ones from Telemark and Hallingdal , and almost none came from Christiania ( Oslo ) . They were country folk who were squeezed by virtue of living in a small country with large mountains that left only so much land to farm , not nearly enough . Crops were poor , and then one fall , the fishing boats returned to Stavanger , riding high in the water . The herring had disappeared . The people went straight to church and prayed God to send them an answer . No herring ! It was as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proud people who had always worked hard , and poverty was no shame to them  --  a comical trait to the sophisticates of Oslo who flocked to the popular operetta Stavanger ! 0 Ja ! , in which the westerners were portrayed as dolts who played fiddles and ate74FOREBEARSlutefisk and talked funny and who felt flush if they had a kroner in their pocket  --  but this calamity shook them to the innermost for , without fish , they were faced with death by starvation . They were certain of one thing , though : they would not migrate to the city , as others had done . Years of fervent preaching had taught them that Oslo was a sinkhole of Swedish depravity and Danish corruption , where honest people quickly descended to atheism and indolenceand a taste for worldly display . They had seen young men depart for Oslo with a promise to remain pure on their lips , only to return a few years later , decked out in silken European waistcoats and featheredhats and prissy satin slippers , talking with the fashionable Oslovianstammer , the sophisticated Oslovian lisp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the hearty Stavanger laugh ( hor-hor ) but with the despicable Oslovian nose-laugh ( hhnn-hhnn ) . To maintain their honest rural way of life , they decided they must leave the homeland , and America loomed large in their imagination as a country with plenty of country in which to settle and prosper and hold to all they kept closest to their hearts . Some friends had gone to America already and sent back glowing letters that were posted in the churches and copied and passed from hand to hand . My dear Christian wrote Gunder Muus , in Wisconsin , to his Stavanger cousin in 1867 , you will scarcely believe my good fortune in the six short months I have been in America . I was warmly received in New York from whence I travelled by train to Chicago and thence to here in Muskego where I found a fine situation with a merchant . He is from Norway as are most citizens here , so one feels quite at home instantly but without the deprivation and worry . The air is sweet , the land is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excellent . In the lake near town , two Sundays ago , I caught ten pounds of fish in only an hour  --  real fighters , both of them , but I hooked them , using only worms for bait , and hauled them onto the shore after an exhilarating duel . This is quite ordinary here . Everyone catches fish ! Not like back home where the few good spots are reserved for landowners . Perhaps someday you yourself will come to America , and then I promise you a good time at the lake . LAKE WOBEGON DAYS FOREBEARSThe next year , Muus had relocated in Goodhue County , Min nesota , where he settled down to try his hand at farming , but fishin was uppermost in his mind . My dear Christian , I have many thoughts of home , most of them sad and full of longing , but when I feel most dissatisfied and lonely , I can always improve my disposition with a few hours on Lake Roscoe or the Zumbrota River . Truly America is a great country where a poor Norwegian immigrant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Only string do I use and a hook ! No aristocratic contraption for me ! And yet with a little patience and industry and some cunning , the ordinary man can lure five-pound fish , as many as he likes , where others much wealthier may not get a single nibble . Thus do we prosper here , and I pray that you will soon be here with us , cousin , and enjoy the bounty of America . Muus lost all in the Panic of 1873 and had to move to Minneapol and take a job as a stockboy in a grocery store , a terrible disappoin ment for him . My dear Christian , so much has happened since last I wrote and none of it good , but why burden you with my endless troubles ? I have a bed and a roof over my head and three meals a day , so I should not complain . God will look after us . I pray daily that He will show me the way out of this noisy , filthy , disease-ridden city full of scoundrels and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get rich any way they can as soon as possible  --  a city on a great river which they have filled with poisons and excrement so that no fish can be taken from it . There are lakes nearby , but on Sunday I am too tired to walk so far , and when I have gone I found them crowded with ignorant people who spend a fortune on a pole and then stand and beat the water with it ! They fling the line to and fro until it is tangled around their necks and meanwhile they curse and drink whiskey and drop garbage on the ground and talk disgust- ing talk . This is no place for a decent man . I am saving my money toward the day when I can go north , where they say the lakes are pure and bountiful and uninhabited . When I reach there , I will write again . Muus saved $165 in four months by refraining from all entertainment , and the following September he rode the train north to St. Cloud , where he continued on foot , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He walked through a pouring rain , carrying his rucksack under his thin coat , singing hymns to give himself strength , and felt weak when he reached the settlement of New Munichtwo days later , and collapsed on the street , feverish and out of his mind , and was treated there for consumption by a Mrs. Hoppe who decided the poor man was dying and put him on a wagon for Lake Wobegon , where , at least , he could expire among his countrymen . The wagoneer , approaching the town , saw no life in his passenger , lying under the canvas , and dumped him in a ditch , knowing what a lot of trouble a person has when he drives into town with a dead man , and there Muus awoke a few hours later . His fever was gone , and the sun shone down on him . He heard water lapping . He crawled out of the ditch and saw he was thirty feet from the shore of a fine lake . Out on the water , a man sat motionless on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Muus felt as weak as a baby and his throat was parched , so he was surprised at the strength of his voice as it hollered out of him : " How are they biting ? " " Pretty good , " the man yelled back . " Is there room for two ? " " Are you a fisherman ? " " Yes . " " Then there is room . " And he poled the raft to shore , helped the formerly dying man onto the craft , and the two of them spent several hours pulling a good string of sunfish and crappies out of the still water among the weeds and water lilies . The man was Magnus Olesen , and he and Muus did not exchange three words all afternoon . In fact , it was n't until dark that Magnus got around to asking if Muus was ill , and by that time , he was not . He was the first Norwegian bachelor farmer in Lake Wobegon . He farmed three acres north of the lake , only enough to keep him stockedLAKE WOBEGON @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was fishing , which he did every day except Sundays . Every fish he caught , he smoked in a stone smokehouse as big as the shack he lived in , which was beside the smokehouse . People wondered about him , of course . He did n't join the Norske Folke society or the Lutheran church , though he attended church faithfully , taking his place in the " doubters ' pew " at the rear , and he never spoke up when the emigrants gathered for the weekly reading of their mutual copy of the Minneapolis Tidende and , strangest of all , he got no mail . He was not known at the post office . He was barely known at all . He was generous with his smoked fish , though , and always carried a few in his shirt for distribution , and to those who got some , he was not so strange . They figured that a man who could make the finest smoked fish they ever tasted was entitled to some leeway in his private life . The minister got a fish every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Christmas , and any Norwegian who took sick found a large smoked fish at the front door the next day , placed on the lintel to keep it away from cats and dogs . The fish was good for any kind of intestinal problem and was credited with having saved the lives of several who were wasting away until the sweet smell made them strong enough to sit up and eat it , including Anna Torgerson , fading fast from dysentery , who recovered and married him , July 6 , 1873 , after which he fished only every other day . Magnus and Katherine had three daughters before she died giving birth in 1871 , so the Norwegian Bible was passed to the eldest girl , Hildur , and then to her daughter . Hildur married Oskar Tollefson after his first wife died , and they had seven children , including Amelia ( b. 1885 ) who married Peter Ingqvist , begetting nine , including Esther ( b. 1906 ) , who married Gustaf Bunsen , by whom she had four children , including Clarence ( b. 1925 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having given it to him as a wedding present when he and Arlene were married , after Eva learned she could not have children . After fathering the Katherine Oleson branch , Magnus married again in 1872 , had three more children by Mari Tollerud , a hired girl at the Watsons ' who dumped dishwater on him when he first proposed , and , after her death fourteen years later of consumption , married a third time , Ada Tom- merdahl , the widow of a minister who drowned , with four sons , with whom he lived until his death in 1911 at the age of seventy-five , the patriarch of a great house of descendants , now mostly scattered and gone off to places almost as strange as America was to him . A fine portrait of the old man taken when he was sixty-eight and strong as a horse , his white beard like a buttress and his eyes still clear and sharp despite this print having been photographed from a photograph of a photograph  --  this portrait hangs in a vast white living room in La @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a stone house in the province of Michoacan , Mexico , in a dreadful driftwood frame above a purple plush couch in a Chicago condo , and God only knows where else aside from Lake Wobegon , of course , where you see it almost everywhere you look . Anyone who looks hard at him gets a good hard look back telling you to buck up , be strong , believe in God , and be about your business . By 1904 , when the picture was taken by his grandson John Tollefson , who had a studio in the Central Building , Magnus Oleson had seen more history than a person could put in a book , not that he was a man to think about writing one . His letters home to Norway began to peter out when the Tollefson party rode into town and ceased abruptly when Katherine Shroeder arrived : just stopped . He had written them because he was lonely and had no one to talk to , and the day she came , the literary chapter of his life snapped shut and he began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that in 1871 , while still in mourning for his first wife , he set a record for planting corn , using the old hand planter and covering the seeds with his foot : sixteenacres in one day  --  it 's in The New Albion Sun ( formerly the Star ) . We know that in 1876 he sold 257 bushels of wheat at $1.75 and eight years later the price was down to 35  --  . A bushel made about forty pounds of flour , and at less than a penny a pound , he felt somebody was cheating him so he took up potato farming and kept a small dairy herd ; the 1883 class consisted of Lily , Jenny , Bessie , Molly , Daisy , Helen , and Flora . His horses were named Norma and Fanny , two gray mares that cost him $400 , and their children were Gypsy and Blaze whom his children rode to high school in town the first year there was one , 1885 . He served on the school board for ten years and donated firewood . In 1894 he donated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( W.S.T.U. ) , of which his daughter Anna was a founder , and the following year donated a pig toward the purchase of an organ ( $259 from Brunelle &; Sons , Chicago ) for the Norwegian Lutheran Church , of which his grandson John Olaf Quist was choirmaster . He liked music . He enjoyed having his feet tickled . He was a heavy reader . He subscribed to four newspapers , one English ( the St. Paul paper through which he had found his wife , not the Sun , which was too Republican for his taste ) and three Norwegian , the Posten , the Budstikken ( later the Tidende ) , and NordiskFolkebladet , in which he faithfully followed the funny strip " Ole og Tina " which popularized the words " Uffda ! " da ! " and " Ishda ! " His contempt for bankers was exceeded only by his disgust for lawyers . " Honesty in a lawyer , " he said , " is like a hen 's hind legs . " He kept all his teeth except two , which were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who practiced dentistry with a pair of pliers . During the farm depression of the 189os , he sold his two hundred sixty acres to Elmer Tollerud , the husband of his granddaughter Viola , and moved to a house in town . He never visited Minneapolis , never rode in an automobile , but in 1906 at the annual county fair put on by the Agriculture Society , of which he was a charter member , he rode solo in a hydrogen balloon to the end of its tether , about three hundred feet , and looked down at the crowd , many of them related to him , and at a town he had observed for more than fifty years , and stayed aloft for his full five minutes . When he died , he was buried next to Katherine after a service that , according to his wishes , included a good sermon in Norwegian and the singing of " Hvor Finner vel Hjertet sin Saligste Ro ? " ( " Where Does the Heart Find Its Most Blessed Peace ? " ) . " No innocent man buys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Raymond Duff Payne , and yet there 's so much we 'd love to know about the early years of our town which is buried in silence . A few dim recollections from ancient relatives who were asked for information only after they got feeble , by an earnest grandchild , about matters that no longer much interested them . The letters are for the most part lost ; they were all mailed . The photographs are for the most part formal . No picture exists of a Saturday night dance , for example , of the thousands put on in houses before the Alhambra Ballroom ( &; FOREBEARSRoller Skating Rink ) was built in 1887 , and yet it was ( along with church ) one of the bedrocks of Norwegian life . The first Social Circle was formed in 1871 by Oskar , six families who took turns hosting the weekly dance when they all could " turn loose " after a week of digging . People walked miles to a dance , even in the winter . It began at seven P.M. and went for four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but often they went until four in the morning . Little houses packed with people , the furniture piled , hauled upstairs or out in the yard . Some played whist , but everyone danced . Oskar and brother Paul played violins and their mother the piano ( if there was a piano , otherwise Mr. Jaeger played his harmonica ) . Paul was so good , his father let him off the hard work so his hands would n't get stiff . They sat on top of the piano , the house was so crowded . Little boys dashed in and plunked some bad notes and ran away . They played polskas and schottisches , springleiks , masurkas , and of course the vals . To a woman who had risen at five A.M. for six days in a row to make a fire , haul water , feed poultry , milk , pump water for the livestock , and then do laundry and cook and clean house and perhaps also help out in the field , the Saturday dance was a bright spot that she worked toward . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " old Mrs. Berge murmured to a grandson whose name she could n't remember . She could n't even remember the work so well . " Anything that needed doing , we did it ourselves . " She did however remember the dances . She came from Norway to work for Carl Ingqvist and family for $3 a week , seven days a week with Saturday night and Sunday morning off . " They were good to me . " They took her to the Circle . Sixty years later she remembered the dancers and the music clearly . " The room was full of people laughing , hopping up and down . " In 1878 , something about a hill made August Krebsbach think of Bavaria , the contours and the two spruce in the dusk , and he said , " Halt ! " and climbed down off the wagon and tasted the dirt . It was April , his children were tired of riding , and his wife , Clara , was pregnant . The register of deeds shows 18o acres purchased April i8 for $2700 , $20008oLAKE WOBEGON @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elevator records show that in his first season he tried potatoes , the next year corn . In 188o , there was a misunderstanding over credit , and Mr. Peabody at the elevator " initiated proceedings " that sent the sheriff and county clerk to roust the Krebsbachs out of bed at gunpoint and seize two beds and an oak dresser . Shots were fired , a brindle cow was killed , and the family was threatened with prison , all of which appears in the records simply as a credit of $21 . From this shameful incident began the Krebsbachs ' enmity toward town , which lasted long after the sheriff shot himself and Mr. Peabody departed with several thousand dollars that did n't belong to him . Augustpaid off the bank , then never set foot in New Albion or Lake Wobegon again . The names of August and Clara vanished from the church roll , their three boys and two girls left school , their trade went to the merchants of St. Hubert . Only the tax assessor noted their existence . Even the fire that burned their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That is thought to have happened in 1891 , in January . How the family survived , nobody knew . Perhaps they lived with their animals until spring , or else they may have moved temporarily to St. Hubert . St. Hubert dried up and blew away fifty years ago , so there is no record there , and whatever the Krebsbachs ' neighbors knew about them , they did n't consider it worth telling their children , and the story is gone . August and Clara may be buried in the St. Hubert cemetery , a sad story itself . The promoter who sold the lots also sold gravestones of an inferior grade of granite , which disintegrated . The ruins were picked up and put in one big pile which you can see today next to County 49 , across the road from some old stone foundations . The boy who got the farm was Manfred , Fred to the few who knew him , who married a St. Hubert girl and led an unexceptional life except for his great isolation , although after she died in childbirth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hoist a beer at Barney 's , howbeit in silence . Old-timers remember him as " the red-faced man " who never spoke other than what was necessary to buy things . One day , Rev. Olaf Hauge drove out to Krebsbachs ' and spent an evening , and they became Lutherans , he and his sister , Mrs. Winkler , whose husband had run off , and her two boys . Whatever this taught FredFOREBEARSabout forgiveness and regeneration did not change his habit of silence  --  for one thing , he was a German Lutheran and the church was Norwegian and worshiped in Norwegian until 1934 , when a monthly English service was added ; and for another , the former county clerk was a deacon . Fred endured baptism and never entered church again until he was carried in for his funeral ( 1929 ) . He did send the boys , though , and with Leon and Roman , the grudge finally ended . They never discussed it with anyone else , it ended without comment after forty-nine years when Fred died . Roman was the older , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blue bib-overalls that he stretched fore and aft , belly and shanks , a very admirable figure of a man , with hands big as legs of lamb , a ruddy face , a distinguished band of white across his forehead where the hat left off , and a white dome above the fringe of curly brown hair . He was an admirable horseman in his day , then an admirable mechanic ; he was admired for sheer strength , having once lifted a steer and put it on a wagon ; he was admired for never being at a loss for words and never wasting any either . He even spat tobacco admirably  --  pooching his cheeks and putting the thin brown line exactly where he wanted it , not a big blow , just a real nice spit , very graceful and discreet . Most of all , he was a good worker , steady ( one of the finest words one man could say about another ) ; he did n't slack off ; he was good for twelve , fifteen hours of work a day . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't keep a count of it , and when he worked for them , it was the same as working for himself . They called him , he came , and he carried his end and some of theirs . Clarence Bunsen said that Roman Winkler could not be convicted of horse theft anywhere in Mist County if they found the horses in his bedroom . He had to be a good worker , the farm being poor as it was , though you could n't tell it from looking at that clean white house , the red barn and the row of outbuildings ( granary , pig barn , chicken coop , tractor shed , and tool shed ) which was as trim and well-kept as an Army post though he got no help from his brother Leon . Neither brother ever married , so far as we knew ( though Leon spent a few years in the Philippines with the Navy and hinted at other arrangements there ) . For almost all of Leon 's life , they lived under the same roof . LAKE WOBEGON DAYSLeon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrists and delicate fingers and went around in jeans , a blue sweater , and a stocking cap . He had a faraway look in his eye so that , talking to him , eventually you 'd look over your shoulder to see what he saw back there , and he had the ability to look at work for days at a time . Some days he stayed in bed until afternoon . Bed , after all , was where he found himself when he woke up , he felt fine there , and he could think of no reason to get out , because his bookcase was by the bed , and books were all he needed . He could crawl into a book and pull the covers over him and stay until it got dark , and then go back to sleep . He bought books at auctions , he bought them C.O.D. , and every week he came to town with Roman and hauled a bagful out of the library . Being Roman 's brother , he was not talked about , only a little , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of his bright ideas , which did n't last more than a day or two . Once he decided to put on Coriolanus and talked four people into coming to a rehearsal , which he forgot to attend . Another time he started to build an oceangoingyacht in the barn , then loaded potatoes in the hull . The boat broke up and Roman used the lumber to make a ramp to load hogs on the truck . Drink was n't his problem , inspiration was . Once he sat all night under Hazel Bunsen 's bedroom window , presumably thinking about her , which frightened Hazel , who was young and practical , but he got over her sometime around breakfast and walked home . When they were younger , the brothers had some fierce arguments about work and responsibility , but as they got old , they were able to say it all in a few words . " Oh , Leon . " " Ah , Roman . " Roman farmed , kept house , cooked , did laundry , did everything but make Leon 's bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defense that sometimes he was on the verge of doing chores only to find that Roman had already . He also said that Roman tried to make more of the farm than it was , which was true . Whatever God intended that land to be , it certainly was n't a showplace for seed corn or the home of purebred Poland hogs . Roman worked , Leon said , as if he could by sheer effort pull the corn up out of the ground and make it grow . Leon said that he worked , too . On a book , though he was n't ready to show it to anyone , which would distill the wisdom of the agesFOREBEARSinto a single volume . This book , when finished , would change people 's minds about him , but he was in no hurry to finish it , knowing that work that lasts comes slow . Then one day Leon announced he was leaving home , at the age of sixty-two . Roman had dreams at night in which he rounded up pigs who were loose in the corn , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hill and made him a sod house in the meadow . Dug down six feet and put up walls of turf blocks and laid old lumber across the top and laid on a sod roof , and he moved in with his books and bed and a woodstove . " My brother who lives in the dirt , " Roman said , but he was lonely without him and came down in the evening with Leon 's hot supper in a pie tin . Leon did n't lack for visitors the last few years . He planted flowers on the roof , which bloomed beautifully in the summer and also in the winter , germinated by the heat of the stove . People drove out to see it , a patch of bright colors in the snow , and dropped in to see him . He climbed out of bed , marked his place in the book , snipped off some roots from his ceiling , and boiled up tea . He died in a bed full of books , with an encyclopedia on his chest , open to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over his face , hauled out the woodstove , hitched the team to the two main timbers , clucked twice , and buried Leon under a ton of dirt . After a couple years , rains had leveled the mound , and Roman , who was forgetful in his old age , plowed the meadow and planted corn . In that one patch , he got the corn he always wanted , seven and eight feet high , like a squadron of soldiers . " Ja , that 's the best I ever had , " he said . " I just wish that my brother Leon could be here to see it . " Jonson Ingqvist drove a black Buick touring car with leather upholsterythough his home was only two blocks from the bank , and he kept a lake home on Sunfish Bay a quarter-mile from home , and he was said to own fourteen suits , all of them blue . In 1908 , he went to Minneapolis for the big Hallingdal picnic , having promised his mother he 'd look up her old friends and tell them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would see them in Heaven . He wore a white linen suit , a whiteLAKE WOBEGON DAYS I FOREBEARSshirt , a straw hat , and a gold stickpin , and on his hip he carried a silver flask of brandy . He knew he would need it , spending a day with his countrymen . He walked from his hotel to the Milwaukee Depot and when he boarded the train to Minnehaha Park , his heart sank , it was as if he had lost everything he had worked for and been thrown back into a former life . The car was packed , so was the next one , with families carrying boxes and baskets that smelled of fried pork and meatballs . The people smelled of lye soap . They were as excited as if it were a train to Niagara Falls and all jabbering in a language he only knew how to be polite in . The park was less than five miles away , but Jonson wished the train had a first-class car where he could sit and talk to men in English .

Her family marched to school , and the manure hit the ventilator . They wanted her in plain view with a gold tassel and words coming out of her mouth . As it turned out , Charlene 's speech was on " Service to Others " and was based on Christ 's words to the rich young man : " Give all that you have to the poor and follow me . " The Holms thought it was the greatest speech ever given in English . Her dad did n't hear a word of it , he was taking 8mm color movies . But you can forgive the Holms their pride , if you remember back to 1926. 86In 1926 , Norwegian royalty visited Lake Wobegon , arranged by Jonson Ingqvist , who was a big contributor to the Republican party and knew the governor well enough so the governor had once been to his home for coffee one afternoon and a hundred children stood out on the front lawn to watch him drink it . So when Jonson heard that King Haakon VII would be visiting Minnesota , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ King , for almost two hours , 2:30 to 3:45 P.M. , on May 14 , 1926 . The town learned about it in early April , and people got down to serious yard work . The Germans pooh-poohed the visit at first . They pointed out that King Haakon VII was n't even Norwegian , he was a Danish prince whom the Norwegian parliament had imported when Norway split off from Sweden in 1905 . And this was America , where every person is as good as another . But when the good Norwegians of Lake Wobegonthought of the King coming to visit , they got so excited they had to sit down . In Norway , their ancestors had been dirt poor and never saw royalty , let alone hung around with them , so the King 's visit was a sign that they had made good in America . At the same time , they had been so busy making good , they had begun to forget old Norway . So the King 's visit was like the past coming to greet them , as if their grandfatherrose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say , " You done good . I 'm proud . " They set to work making themselves worthy . They polished up their Norwegian . They bought new clothes . They painted . They fixed up . In 1926 , most farmers came to town in wagons , so they cleaned up Main Street and said , " No more horses there until after the visit . " They created a Norwegian children 's choir where none had been before , and drilled those children in six Norwegian songs . ( The children , now almost seventy , still remember the words . ) And each of them imagined the long black car pulling up at their house , and the tall man walking up to their door to " wisit , " and the bows and the curtsies , and he sits down at their table and has his krummkake and coffee and he says , " Smake saa god . Vaer saa god . Du er saa snille . Mange takk . Mange mange takk . " ( " It tastes so good . Very good . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came the bad news . Mr. Ingqvist decided that since the visit87LAKE WOBEGON DAYS FOREBEARSwould be so short and the King 's schedule was busy , the sensible thing would be to let him lie down and rest . Why show him things he 'd seen a thousand times before ? Why sing him songs he knew already ? No , the King deserved true hospitality . He 'd come to town , sit a moment with the Ingqvists , and then he could go upstairs and have a nap . No choir , no crowds . Quiet . The King should have quiet . To Mr. Ingqvist this was a simple , sensible , humane decision , and he 'd invited the King , so there was no more to be said . Then Mrs. Ingqvist decided they would invite some of her family , the Tollefsons , and then the Berges got in and the Olesons , and soon there were twelve people who would have coffee with the King and then sit quietly downstairs while he rested . The Rognes family , Paul and Florence , was devastated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business with Mr. Ingqvist again , which was n't easy since he owned the bank . Florence was Mrs. Ingqvist 's cousin , they were best friends as girls , and they did n't speak after that . It was soon after that Mrs. Rognes began her career , domineering the Ladies ' Circle at church . Mrs. Holm , mother of Charlene , is Florence 's daughter . It did n't change matters much when , the day before the visit , the King got sick in Minneapolis and could n't come . He 'd been in Americaone week and had attended six lutefisk dinners and was resting in his suite at the Nicollet Hotel . It was only three years after President Warren G. Harding had died from eating something on a tour , and the governor was horrified at the thought of the King expiring in Minnesota of an excess of hospitality , so he was put on toast and tea , and a Norwegian count named Carl was sent in his place . Then Mr. Ingqvist changed his mind . Count Carl would n't be tired , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Count Carl was a big bear of a man with heavy black eyebrows and a rumbling voice , and was a good eater . They gave him a dinner at the Sons of Knute lodge and he ate everything put before him . Then the children 's choir sang their six songs , and with the first note of music , Count Carl 's head fell to his chest and he slept the sleep of the innocent . He snored through the presentation and awoke with the applause and jumped up and took a bow . He spoke for five minutes in Norwegian , got in his car , and left . If he noticed how nice the yards looked , he did n't mention it to anybody . This changed nothing . People were humiliated by the original insult . This hurt has diminished gradually as the people who were n't invited have died . Now almost all of them are dead . Last year , a little act of forgiveness took place at Lake Wobegon Lutheran , in the basement , in the furnace room . Luther Rognes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dedication of the new gas furnace that he donated . He decided to name it for his parents , so he and Pastor David Ingqvist , the great-nephew of Jonson Ingqvist , held a small ceremony . They drilled four holes above the little window that looks in at the pilot light and attached a simple brass plate : The Paul and Florence Ringnes Memorial Furnace . Luther had a bottle of brandy . He poured a little into two Dixie cups and smashed the rest against the furnace . " Well , " said Pastor Ingqvist , " I think you christenedit . Tell me this , " he said , " do you want an announcement in the church bulletin ? " " I do n't know . What would people think ? " " I suppose they would think it was funny . Naming a furnace after your parents . Not many people would do it , I suppose . Why did you ? " Luther thought . " My parents were the proudest people I 've ever known . My mother would n't let even relatives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My father drove forty miles to deposit his money because he did n't get invited to meet the King of Norway in 1926 . If they could choose a memorial for themselves , I 'm sure they 'd prefer a carillon , but I always thought  --  if pride were kindling , our family could heat the church for twenty years . So  --  " " Well , " David says , " if I dedicated the gas tank to the memory of my great-uncle , we 'd have us a complete set . Here 's to you , Luther . Good health . " And they drank a toast and smashed the Dixie cups underfoot and turned out the light and went to lunch . The brass plate to the memory of Paul and Florence above the window ; inside , the little flame flickering . It was a good furnace all last winter , they did n't have a single problem with it : it ran real quiet and when they turned up the thermostat early Sunday morning , she went from fifty to seventyin about an hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my town on the map ?  --  Well , back before cartographers had the benefit of an aerial view , when teams of surveyors tramped from one town to the next , mistakes were made . Sometimes those towns were farther apart than they should have been . Many maps were drawn by French explorers in the bows of canoes bucking heavy rapids , including Sieur Marine de St. Croix , who was dizzy and nauseated when he penciled in the river that bears his name . He was miles off in some places , but since the river formed the Minnesota-Wisconsin border , revision was politically impossible and the mistakes were inked in , though it left thousands of people sitting high and dry on the other side . A worse mistake was made by the Coleman Survey of 1866 , which omitted fifty square miles of central Minnesota ( including Lake Wobe-90gon ) , an error that lives on in the F.A.A. 's Coleman Course Correction , a sudden lurch felt by airline passengers as they descend into Minnesotaair space on flights from New York or Boston . Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ puzzle . The Coleman outfit , headed by Lieutenant Michael Coleman , had been attached to Grant 's army , which they misdirected time and again so that Grant 's flanks kept running head-on into Lee 's rear until Union officers learned to make " right face " a 12o-degree turn . Governor Marshall , however , regarded the 1866 survey as preliminary --  " It will provide us a good general idea of the State , a foundation upon which we can build in the future , " he said  --  though of course it turned out to be the final word . The map was drawn by four teams of surveyors under the direction of Finian Coleman , Michael having left for the Nebraska gold rush , who placed them at the four corners of the state and aimed them inward . The southwest and northwest contingents moved fast over level ground , while the eastern teams got bogged down in the woods , so that , when they met a little west of Lake Wobegon , the four quadrantsdid n't fit within the boundaries legislated by Congress in 1851 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaving the legislature to wrestle with the discrepancy . The legislature simply reproportioned the state by eliminating the overlap in the middle , the little quadrangle that is Mist County . " The soil of that region is unsuited to agriculture , and we doubt that its absence would be much noticed , " Speaker of the House Randolph remarked . In 1933 , a legislative interim commission proposed that the state recover the lost county by collapsing the square mileage of several large lakes . The area could be removed from the centers of the lakes , elongating them slightly so as not to lose valuable shoreline . Oppositionwas spearheaded by the Bureau of Fisheries , which pointed out the walleye breeding grounds to be lost ; and the State Map Amendmentwas attached as a rider to a bill requiring the instruction of evolution in all secondary schools and was defeated by voice vote . Proponents of map change , or " accurates " as they were called , were chastised by their opponents , the so-called " moderates , " who denied the existence of Mist County on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LAKE WOBEGON DAYS SUM US QUOD SUM USa moderate cried one day on the Senate floor in St. Paul . " Can you show me one scintilla of evidence that it exists ? "  --  and , on the other hand , denounced the county as a threat to property owners every- where . " If this county is allowed to rear its head , then no boundary is sacred , no deed is certain , " the moderates said . " We might as well reopen negotiations with the Indians . " Wobegonians took the defeat of inclusion with their usual calm . " We felt that we were a part of Minnesota by virtue of the fact that when we drove more than a few miles in any direction , we were in . Minnesota , " Hjalmar Ingqvist says . " It did n't matter what anyone said . " In 198o , Governor Al Quie became the first governor to set foot in Mist County , slipping quietly away from his duties to attend a cere- mony dedicating a plaque attached to the Statue of the Unknown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was here , then he disappeared , " his aides told reporters , all the time the Governor was enjoying a hearty meatball lunch in the company of fellow Lutherans . In his brief remarks , he saluted Lake Wobegon for its patience in anonymity . " Seldom has a town made such a sacrifice in remaining unrecognized so long , " he said , though other speakers were quick to assure him that it had been no sacrifice , really , but a true pleasure . " Here in 1867 the first Norwegian settlers knelt to thank God for bringing them to this place , " the plaque read , " and though noting immediately the rockiness of the soil , remained , sowing seeds of Chris- tian love . " What 's special about this town , it 's pretty much like a lot of towns , is n't it ? There is a perfectly good answer to that question , it only takes a moment to think of it .

Proba- bly the artist meant him to exude confidence in the New World , but his eyes are set a little deep so that dark shadows appear in the late afternoon and by sunset he looks worried . His confident smile turns into a forced grin . In the morning , he is stepping forward , his right hand extended in greeting , but as the day wears on , he hesitates , and finally he appears to be about to turn back . The right hand seems to say , Wait here . I think I forgot something . Nevertheless , he is a landmark and an asset , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damage to him . That tornado skipped in from the northeast ; it blew away one house except for a dresser mirror that was n't so much as cracked  --  amazing ; it 's in the historical society now , and people still bring their relatives to look at it . It also picked up a brand-new Chevy pickup and set it down a quarter-mile away . On a road . In the right-hand lane . In town , it took the roof off the Lutheran church , where nobody was , and missed the Bijou , which was packed for Shame , starring Cliff DeCarlo . And it blew a stalk of quackgrass about six inches into the Unknown Norwegian , in an unusual place , a place where you would n't expect to find grass in a person , a part of the body where you 've been told to insert nothing bigger than your finger in a washcloth . Bud , our municipal employee , pulled it out , of course , but the root was imbedded in the granite , so it keeps growing out . Bud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it will leave a stain on the side of his head , so , when he mows , simply reaches up to the Unknown 's right ear and snips off the blade with his fingernails . It 's not so noticeable , really ; you have to look for it to see it . The plaque that would 've been on the pedestal the town could n't afford was bolted to a brick and set in the ground until Bud dug it out because it was dinging up his mower blade . Now in the historical society museum in the basement of the town hall , it sits next to the Lake Wobegon runestone , which proves that Viking explorers were here in 1381 . Unearthed by a Professor Oftedahl or Ostenwald around 1921 alongside County Road 2 , where the professor , motoring from Chicago to Seattle , had stopped to bury garbage , the small black stone is covered with Viking runic characters which read ( translated by him ) : " 8 of us stopped &; stayed awhile to visit &; have coffee &; a short nap . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about it for now . " Every Columbus Day , the runestone is carried up to the school andLAKE WOIiEGON DAYSput on a card-table in the lunchroom for the children to see , so they can know their true heritage . It saddens Norwegians that America still honors this Italian , who arrived late in the New World and by accident , who was n't even interested in New Worlds but only in spices . Out on a spin in search of curry powder and hot peppers  --  a man on a voyage to the grocery  --  he stumbled onto the land of heroic Vikings and proceeded to get the credit for it . And then to name it America after Amerigo Vespucci , an Italian who never saw the New World but only sat in Italy and drew incredibly inaccurate maps of it . By rights , it should be called Erica , after Eric the Red , who did the work five hundred years earlier . The United States of Erica . Erica the Beautiful . The Erican League . Not many children come to see the runestone where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a locked door in the town hall , down the hall and to the left by the washroom . Viola Tordahl the clerk has the key and is n't happy to be bothered for it . " I do n't know why I ever agreed to do it .

What 's so special about this town is not the food , though Ralph 's Pretty Good Grocery has got in a case of fresh cod . Frozen , but it 's fresher than what 's been in his freezer for months . In the grocery business , you have to throw out stuff sometimes , but Ralph is Norwegianand it goes against his principles . People bend down and peer into the meat case .

Once Ralph went to his brother Benny 's for dinner and Martha put baked swordfish on the table . Ralph 's face burned . His own sister-in-law ! " It 's delicious , " said Mrs. Ralph . " Yeah , " Ralph said , " if it was n't for the mercury poisoning , I 'd take swordfish every day of the week .

What 's special about here is n't special enough to draw a major crowd , though Flag Day  --  you could drive a long way on June 14 to find another like it . Flag Day , as we know it , was the idea of Herman Hochstetter , Rollie 's dad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Day , the Fourth of July , and Flag Day . For the Fourth , he organized a double- loop parade around the block which allowed people to take turns marching and watching . On Armistice Day , everyone stepped outside at 11 A.M. and stood in silence for two minutes as Our Lady 's bell tolled eleven times . Flag Day was his favorite . For a modest price , he would install a bracket on your house to hold a pole to hang your flag on , or he would drill a hole in the sidewalk in front of your store with his drill gun powered by a .22 shell . Bain ! And in went the flag . On patriotic days , flags flew all over ; there were flags on the tall poles , flags on the short , flags in the brackets on the pillars and the porches , and if you were flagless you could expect to hear from Herman . His hairy arm around your shoulder , his poochlike face close to yours , he would say how proud he was that so many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see the obvious , that you were a gap in the ranks . In June 1944 , the day after D-Day , a salesman from Fisher Hat called on Herman and offered a good deal on red and blue baseball caps . " Do you have white also ? " Herman asked . The salesman thought that white caps could be had for the same wonderful price . Herman ordered two hundred red , two hundred white , and one hundred blue . By the end of the year , he still had four hundred and eighty-six caps . The inspiration of the Living Flag was born from that overstock . On June 14 , 1945 , a month after 7-E Day , a good crowd assembled in front of the Central Building in response to Herman 's ad in the paper : Honor " AMERICA " June 14 AT 4 p.m . Be proud of " Our Land &; People " . Be part of the " LIVING FLAG " . Do n't let it be said that Lake Wobegon was " Too Busy " . Be on time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handed out the caps , and Herman stood on a stepladder and told people where to stand . He lined up the reds and whites into stripes , then got the blues into their square . Mr. Hanson climbed up on the roof of the Central Building and took a photograph , they sang the national anthem , and then the Living Flag dispersed . The photograph appeared in the paper the next week . Herman kept the caps . In the flush of victory , people were happy to do as told and stand in place , but in 1946 and 1947 , dissension cropped up in the ranks : people complained about the heat and about Herman  --  what gave him the idea he could order them around ? " People ! Please ! I need your attention ! You blue people , keep your hats on ! Please ! Stripe No. 4 , you 're sagging ! You reds , you 're up here ! We got too many white people , we need more red ones ! Let 's do this without talking , people ! I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Some of you are not paying attention ! Everybody shut up ! Please ! " One cause of resentment was the fact that none of them got to see the Flag they were in ; the picture in the paper was black and white . Only Herman and Mr. Hanson got to see the real Flag , and some boys too short to be needed down below . People wanted a chance to go up to the roof and witness the spectacle for themselves . " How can you go up there if you 're supposed to be down here ? " Herman said . " You go up there to look , you got nothing to look at . Is n't it enough to know that you 're doing your part ? " On Flag Day , 1949 , just as Herman said , " That 's it ! Hold it now ! " one of the reds made a break for it  --  dashed up four flights of stairs to the roof and leaned over and had a long look . Even with the hole heLAKE WOBEGON DAYSleft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Flag filled the street below . A perfect Flag ! The reds so brilliant ! He could n't take his eyes off it . " Get down here ! We need a picture ! " Herman yelled up to him . " How does it look ? " people yelled up to him . " Unbelievable ! I ca n't describe it ! " he said . So then everyone had to have a look . " No ! " Herman said , but they took a vote and it was unanimous . One by one , members of the Living Flag went up to the roof and admired it . It was marvelous ! It brought tears to the eyes , it made one reflect on this great country and on Lake Wobegon 's place in it . One wanted to stand up there all afternoon and just drink it in . So , as the first hour passed , and only forty of the five hundred had been to the top , the others got more and more restless . " Hurry up ! Quit dawdling ! You 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a chance ! " Herman sent people up in groups of four , and then ten , but after two hours , the Living Flag became the Sitting Flag and then began to erode , as the members who had had a look thought about heading home to supper , which infuriated the ones who had n't . " Ten more minutes ! " Herman cried , but ten minutes became twenty and thirty , and people snuck off and the Flag that remained for the last viewer was a Flag shot through by cannon fire . In 1950 , the Sons of Knute took over Flag Day . Herman gave them the boxes of caps . Since then , the Knutes have achieved several good Flags , though most years the attendance was poor . You need at least four hundred to make a good one . Some years the Knutes made a " no-look " rule , other years they held a lottery . One year they experimentedwith a large mirror held by two men over the edge of the roof , but when people leaned back and looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was dirt poor , which I figured out as a child from the fact we had such a bad vacuum . When you vacuumed the living room , it would groan and stop and you had to sit and wait for it to groan and start up , then vacuum like mad before it quit again , but it did n't have good suction either . You had to stuff the hairballs into it . I also knew it because Donald Hoglund told me . He asked me how much my dad earned , and I said a thousand dollars , the most money I could imagine , and he shrieked , " You 're poor ! You 're poor ! " So we were . And , in a town where everyone was either Lutheran or Catholic , we were neitherone . We were Sanctified Brethren , a sect so tiny that nobody but us and God knew about it , so when kids asked what I was , I just said Protestant . It was too much to explain , like having six toes . You would rather keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lutheranism by a preacher who gave a rousing sermon on grace that Grandpa heard as a young man while taking Aunt Esther 's dog home who had chased a Model T across town . He sat down on the church steps and listenedLAKE WOBEGON DAYSto the voice boom out the open windows until he made up his mind to go in and unite with the truth , but he took one look from the vestibule and left . " He was dressed up like the pope of Rome , " said Grandpa , " and the altar and the paintings and the gold candlesticks  --  my gosh , it was just a big show . And he was reading the whole darn thing off a page , like an actor . " Jesus said , " Where two or three are gathered together in my name , there am I in the midst of them , " and the Brethren believed that was enough . We met in Uncle Al 's and Aunt Flo 's bare living room with plain folding chairs arranged facing in toward the middle . No clergymanin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that would make one person too prominent . No upholstery , it would lead to complacency . No picture of Jesus , He was in our hearts . The faithful sat down at the appointed hour and waited for the Spirit to move one of them to speak or to pray or to give out a hymn from our Little Flock hymnal . No musical notation , for music must come from the heart and not off a page . We sang the texts to a tune that fit the meter , of the many tunes we all knew . The idea of reading a prayer was sacrilege to us  --  " if a man ca n't remember what he wants to say to God , let him sit down and think a little harder , " Grandpa said . " There 's the Lord 's Prayer , " said Aunt Esther meekly . We were sitting on the porch after Sunday dinner . Esther and Harvey were visiting from Minneapolis and had attended Lake Wobegon Lutheran , she having turned Lutheran when she married him , a subject that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that prayer ? Sitting and reciting like a bunch of school-children ? " Harvey cleared his throat and turned to me with a weak smile . " Speaking of school , how are you doing ? " he asked . There was a lovely silence in the Brethren assembled on Sunday morning as we waited for the Spirit . Either the Spirit was moving someone to speak who was taking his sweet time or else the Spirit was playing a wonderful joke on us and letting us sit , or perhaps silence was the point of it . We sat listening to rain on the roof , distant traffic , a radio playing from across the street , kids whizzing by on bikes , dogs barking , as we waited for the Spirit to inspire us . It was like sitting on the porch with your family , when nobody feels that they have to makePROTESTANTtalk . So quiet in church . Minutes drifted by in silence that was sweet to us . The old Regulator clock ticked , the rain stopped and the room changed light as the sun broke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motes of dust falling through it  --  the smell of clean clothes and floor wax and wine and the fresh bread of Aunt Flo which was Christ 's body given for us . Jesus in our midst , who loved us . So peaceful , and we loved each other too . I thought perhaps the Spirit was leading me to say that , but I was just a boy , and children were supposed to keep still . And my affections were not pure . They were tainted with a sneaking admiration of Catholics  --  Catholic Christmas , Easter , the Living Rosary , and the Blessing of the Animals , all magnificent . Everythingwe did was plain , but they were regal and gorgeous  --  especiallythe Feast Day of St. Francis , which they did right out in the open , a feast for the eyes . Cows , horses , some pigs , right on the church lawn . The turmoil , animals bellowing and barking and clucking and cats scheming how to escape and suddenly leaping out of the girl 's arms who was holding on tight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the leash , and the ocarina band of third-graders playingCatholic dirges , and the great calm of the sisters , and the flags , and the Knights of Columbus decked out in their handsome black suits  --  I stared at it until my eyes almost fell out , and then I wished it would go on much longer . " Christians , " my uncle Al used to say , " do not go in for show , " referring to the Catholics . We were sanctified by the blood of the Lord , therefore we were saints , like St. Francis , but we did n't go in for feasts or ceremonies , involving animals or not . We went in for sitting , all nineteen of us , in Uncle Al 's and Aunt Flo 's living room on Sunday morning and having a plain meeting and singing hymns in our poor thin voices while not far away the Catholics were whooping it up . I was n't allowed inside Our Lady , of course , but if the Blessing of the Animals on the Feast Day of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know but what they had elephants in there and acrobats . I sat in our little group and envied them for the splendor and gorgeousness , as we tried to sing without even a harmonica to give us the pitch . Hymns , Uncle Al said , did n't have to be sung perfect , because God looks on the heart , and if you are In The Spirit , then all praise is good . The Brethren , also known as the Saints Gathered in the Name of102LAKE WOBEGON DAYS PROTESTANTChrist Jesus , who met in the living room were all related to each other and raised in the Faith from infancy except Brother Mel who was rescued from a life of drunkenness , saved as a brand from the burning , a drowning sailor , a sheep on the hillside , whose immense red nose testified to his previous condition . I envied his amazing story of how he came to be with us . Born to godly parents , Mel left home at fifteen and joined the Navy . Ile sailed to distant lands in a submarine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which led him finally to the Union Gospel Mission in Minneapolis where he heard God 's voice " as clear as my voice speaking to you . " He was twenty-six , he slept under bridges and in abandoned buildings , he drank two quarts of white muscatel every day , and then God told him that he must be born again , and so he was , and became the new Mel , except for his nose . Except for his nose , Mel Burgess looked like any forty-year-old Brethren man : sober , preferring dark suits , soft-spoken , tending towardgirth . His nose was what made you look twice : battered , swollen , very red with tiny purplish lines , it looked ancient and very dead on his otherwise fairly handsome face , the souvenir of what he had been saved from , the " Before " of his " Before . . . and After " advertisement for being born again . For me , there was nothing before . I was born among the bornagain . This living room so hushed , the Brethren in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were put away on Sunday morning ) around the end-table draped with a white cloth and the glass of wine and loaf of bread ( unsliced ) was as familiar to me as my mother and father , the founders of my life . I had always been here . Our family sat in one row against the picture window . Al and Florence and their three , Janet and Paul and Johnny , sat opposite us , I saw the sky and the maple tree reflected in my uncle 's glasses . To our left , Great-Aunt Mary sat next to Aunt Becky and Uncle Louie , and to our right were Grandma and Grandpa and Aunt Faith , and behind them was Mel , sitting on the piano bench . His wife , Rita , was a Lutheran . She only came occasionally and when she did , she stood out like a brass band . She used lipstick and had plucked eyebrows and wore bright hats . Brethren women showed only a faint smudge of powder on their cheeks and their hats were small and either black ornavy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Al had stood up to read from the Lord 's Word , and she said , " Pardon me , which chapter did you say ? "  --  and we all shuddered as if she had dropped a plate on the floor : women did not speak in meeting . Another time , Sunday morning , she made as if to partake of the bread as it was passed , and Grandpa snatched it away from her . It had to be explained to Rita later that she could not join in the Lord 's Supper with us because she was not in fellowship . We were " exclusive " Brethren , a branch that believed in keeping itself pure of false doctrine by avoiding association with the impure . Some Brethren assemblies , mostly in larger cities , were not so strict and broke bread with strangers  --  we referred to them as " the so-called Open Brethren , " the " so-called " implying the shakiness of their position  --  whereaswe made sure that any who fellowshiped with us were straight on all the details of the Faith , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anglican Church in 1865 to worship on the basis of correct principles . In the same year , they posed for a photograph : twenty-one bearded gentlemen in black frock coats , twelve sitting on a stone wall , nine standing behind , gazing solemnly into a sunny day in Plymouth , England , united in their opposition to the pomp and corruption of the Christian aristocracy . Unfortunately , once free of the worldly Anglicans , these firebrands were not content to worship in peace but turned their guns on each other . Scholarly to the core and perfect literalists every one , they set to arguing over points that , to any outsider , would have seemed very minor indeed but which to them were crucial to the Faith , including the question : if Believer A is associated with Believer B who has somehow associated himself with C who holds a False Doctrine , must D break off association with A , even though A does not hold the Doctrine , to avoid the taint ? The correct answer is : Yes . Some Brethren , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to break off with B. The Brethren who felt otherwise promptly broke off with them . This was the Bedford Question , one of several controversies that , inside of two years , split the Brethren into three branches . Once having tasted the pleasure of being Correct and defending True Doctrine , they kept right on and broke up at every opportunity , LAKE WOBEGON DAYSuntil , by the time I came along , there were dozens of tiny Brethren groups , none of which were speaking to any of the others . Our Lake Wobegon bunch was part of a Sanctified Brethren branch known as the Cox Brethren , which was one of a number of " exclusive " Brethren branches  --  that is , to non- Coxians , we were known as " Cox Brethren " ; to ourselves , we were simply The Brethren , the last remnant of the true Church . Our name came from Brother Cox in South Dakota who was kicked out of the Johnson Brethren in 1932  --  for preaching the truth ! So naturally my Grandpa and most of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The split with the Johnsons was triggered by Mr. Johnson 's belief that what was abominable to God in the Old Testament must be abominable still , which he put forward at the Grace &; Truth Bible Conference in Rapid City in 1932 . Mr. Cox stood up and walked out , followed by others . The abomination doctrine not only went against the New Covenant of Grace principle , it opened up rich new areas of controversy in the vast annals of Jewish law . Should Brethren then refrain frorn pork , meat that God had labeled " Unclean " ? Were we to be thrown into the maze of commandments laid out in Leviticus and Deuteronomy , where we are told to smite our enemies with the sword and stone to death rebellious children ? Mr. Johnson 's sermon was against women 's slacks , and he had quoted Deuteronomy 22:5 , " The woman shall not wear that which pertaineth unto a man , neither shall a man put on a woman 's garment : for all that do so are abomination unto the Lord thy God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pro-slacks , felt Mr. Johnson failed to emphasizegrace as having superseded the law , and when Mr. Johnson said , " An abomination to God under the law is still an abomination to God under grace , " Mr. Cox smelled the burning rubber of Error and stood up and marched . He and the other walkouts proceeded to a grove of trees and prayed for Mr. Johnson 's soul , and Mr. Johnson and those seated inside did the same for them . The split was never repaired , though as a result of being thought in favor of slacks , the Cox Brethren became death on the subject . My mother never wore slacks , though she did dress my sister in winter leggings , which troubled Grandpa . " It 's not the leggings so much as what they represent and what they could lead to , " he told her . He thought that baby boys should not **25;14371;TOOLONG unless they were the kind with snaps up the legs . Mother pointed out that the infant Jesus was wrapped in swaddling clothes . " That does n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " They probably wrapped his legs separately . " *Intense scholarship was the heart of the problem . We had no ordainedclergy , believing in the priesthood of all believers , and all were exhorted to devote themselves to Bible study . Some did , Brother Louie and Brother Mel in particular . In Wednesday-night Bible reading , they carried the ball , and some nights you could see that the Coxes of Lake Wobegon might soon divide into the Louies and Mels . One summer night , they set to over the issue of speaking in tongues , Louie arguing that this manifestation of the Spirit was to be sought earnestly , Mel holding that it was a miraculous gift given to the early church but not given by God today . I forget the Scripture verses each of them brought forward to defend his position , but I remember the pale faces , the throat-clearing , the anguished looks , as those two voices went back and forth , straining at the bit , giving no ground  --  the poisoned courtesy ( " I think my brother is overlooking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . , " " Perhaps my brother needs to take a closer look , a prayerful look , at this verse in Hebrews. . . . " ) as the sun went down , neighbor children were called indoors , the neighborsturned out their lights , eleven o'clock came  --  they would n't stop ! " Perhaps , " Grandpa offered , " it would be meet for us to pray forBrethren history is confusing , even to those of us who heard a lot on the subject at a young age  --  the Dennis Brethren , for example : I have no idea whether they left us or we left them . Ditto the Reformed Sanctified , and the Bird Brethren , though I think that Sabbath observance was involved in our ( i.e. , the Beale Brethren , what we were called before 1932 when we Coxes left the Johnson wing ) dispute with the Birds , who tended to be lax about such things as listening to the radio on Sunday and who went in for hot baths to an extent the Beales considered sensual . The Beale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a shell or a husk that the spirit rode around in and that it needed to be kept in line with cold baths . But by the time I came along , we listened to the radio on Sunday and ran the bath hot , and yet we never went back and patched things up with the Birds . Patching up was not a Brethren talent . As my Grandpa once said of the Johnson Brethren , " Anytime they want to come to us and admit their mistake , we 're perfectly happy to sit and listen to them and then come to a decision about accepting them back . " 107LAKE WOBEGON DAYS PROTESTANTthe Spirit to lead us , " hoping to adjourn , but both Louie and Mel felt that the Spirit had led , that the Spirit had written the truth in big black letters  --  if only some people could see it . The thought of Uncle Louie speaking in tongues was fascinating to me . Uncle Louie worked at the bank , he spoke to me mostly about thrift and hard work . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would it sound like gibberish ? Louie said that speaking in tongues was the true sign , that those who believed heard and to those who did n't it was only gabble  --  what if he stood up and said , " Feemalator , jasperator , hoo ha ha , Wamalamagamanama , zis boom bah ! " and everyone else said " Amen ! That 's right , brother ! Praise God ! " and I was the only one who said , " Huh ? " Bible reading finally ended when Flo went up to bed . We heard her crying in the bathroom . Al went up to comfort her . Grandpa took Louie aside in the kitchen . Mel went straight home . We all felt shaky . It was soon after the tongues controversy that the Lake Wobegon Brethren folded their tent and merged into another Cox Assembly in St. Cloud , thirty-two miles away . Twenty-eight Brethren worshiped there , in a large bare rented room on the second floor of the bus depot . We had often gone there for special meetings , revivals , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wednesday night . Grandpa fought for this . " It is right for brethren to join together , " he said . Louie agreed . Mel did n't . He felt God had put us in Lake Wobegonto be a witness . But finally he gave in . " Think of the children , " Grandpa said . One fear of Grandpa 's was that we children would grow up and marry outside the Faith if only because we knew nobody in the Faith except for relatives . Faced with the lonely alternative , we 'd marry a Lutheran , and then , dazzled by the splendid music and vestmentsand stained glass , we 'd forsake the truth for that carnival down the street . Grandpa knew us pretty well . He could see us perk up on Sunday morning when the Lutheran organ pealed out at ten-thirty . The contrast between the church of Aunt Flo 's living room and the power and glory of Lutheranism was not lost on him . Among other Brethren boys and girls , nature would take its course , and in due time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grandpa was looking to the future. ! 08The shift to St. Cloud changed things , all right , and not all for the better . My mother hated the move from the start . She had no Scripture to quote , only a feeling that we had taken a step away from the family , from ourselves . We had walked to Flo 's house , we had sat in Sundayschool class in her kitchen and celebrated the Lord 's death in the living room . The bread we broke was bread Flo baked , and she also made the wine , in a pickle crock in the basement . Flo 's two cats , Ralph and Pumpkin , walked in and out of the service , and along toward the end , having confessed our unworthiness and accepted our redemption by Christ , the smell of Flo 's pot roast , baking at low heat , arose to greet us . Before it was Flo 's and Al 's , the house had been Grandpa 's and Grandma 's  --  Mother had known this room since she was tiny , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her heart that she was leaving home . Sunday in St. Cloud meant a long drive , and Mother was a nervous rider who saw death at every turn . She arrived at the St. Cloud assembly in a frazzledstate . The second-floor room was huge and bare and held no associationsfor her . The long silences were often broken by the roar of bus engines and rumble of bus announcements downstairs . Waiting for the Spirit to guide us to a hymn , a prayer , a passage from Scripture , we heard , " Now boarding at Gate One . . . GreyhoundBus service to Waite Park . . . St. Joseph . . . Collegeville .. . Avon . . . Albany . . . Freeport . . . Melrose . . . and Sauk Center . All aboard , please ! " Whenever a special Bible study meeting was scheduled for Sunday afternoon at three , we could n't drive home after morning meeting , have dinner , and get back to St. Cloud in time , so one Sunday our family traipsed over to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Phil 's House of Good Food . The waitress pushed two tables together and we sat down and studied the menus . My mother blanched at the prices . A chicken dinner went for $2.50 , the roast beef for $2.75 . " It 's a nice place , " Dad said , multiplying the five of us times $2.50 . " I 'm not so hungry , I guess , " he said , " maybe I 'll just have soup . " We were n't restaurantgoers  --  " Why pay good money for food you could make better at home ? " was Mother 's philosophy  --  so we were n't at all sure about restaurant custom : could , for example , a person who had109been seated in a restaurant simply get up and walk out ? Would it be proper ? Would it be legal ? The waitress came and stood by Dad . " Can I get you something from the bar ? " she said . Dad blushed a deep red . The question seemed to imply that he looked like a drinker . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offered to take off her clothes and dance on the table . Then another waitress brought a tray of glasses to a table of four couples next to us . " Martini , " she said , setting the drinks down , " whiskey sour , whiskey sour , Manhattan , whiskey sour , gin and tonic , martini , whiskey sour . " " Ma'am ? Something from the bar ? " Mother looked at her in disbelief . Suddenly the room changed for us . Our waitress looked hardened , rough , cheap  --  across the room , a woman laughed obscenely , " Haw , haw , haw "  --  the man with her lit a cigarette and blew a cloud of smoke  --  a swear word drifted out from the kitchen like a whiff of urineeventhe soft lighting seemed suggestive , diabolical . To be seen in such a place on the Lord 's Day  --  what had we done ? My mother rose from her chair . " We ca n't stay . I 'm sorry , " Dad told the waitress . We all got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restaurant had a good long look at us . A bald little man in a filthy white shirt emerged from the kitchen , wiping his hands . " Folks ? Something wrong ? " he said . " We 're in the wrong place , " Mother told him . Mother always told the truth , or something close to it . " This is humiliating , " I said out on the sidewalk . " I feel like a leper or something . Why do we always have to make such a big production out of everything ? Why ca n't we be like regular people ? " She put her hand on my shoulder . " Be not conformed to this world , " she said . I knew the rest by heart : " . . . but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind , that ye may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God . " " Where we gon na eat ? " Phyllis asked . " We 'll find someplace reasonable , " said Mother , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lunch counter and ate sloppy joes ( called Maid-Rites ) for fifteen cents apiece . They did not agree with us , and we were aware of them all afternoon through prayer meeting and Young People 's . The Cox Brethren of St. Cloud held to the same doctrines as we did but they were not so exclusive , more trusting of the world  --  for example , several families owned television sets . They kept them in their living rooms , out in the open , and on Sunday , after meeting and before dinner , the dad might say , " Well , I wonder what 's on , " knowing perfectly well what was on , and turn it on  --  a Green Bay Packers game  --  and watch it . On Sunday . I ate a few Sunday dinners at their houses , and the first time I saw a television set in a Brethren house , I was dumbfounded . None of the Wobegonian Brethren had one ; we were told that watching television was the same as going to the movies  --  no , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were unaware of the danger . You start getting entangled in the things of the world , and one thing leads to another . First it 's television , then it 's worldly books , and the next thing you know , God 's people are sitting around drinking whiskey sours in dim smoky bars with waitresses in skimpy black outfits and their bosoms displayed like grapefruit. *That was not my view but my parents ' . " Beer is the drunkard 's kindergarten , " said Dad . Small things led to bigger ones . One road leads up , the other down . A man can not serve two masters . Dancing was out , even the Virginia reel : it led to carnal desires . Card-playing was out , which led to gambling , though we did have Rook and Flinch  --  why those and not pinochle ? " Because . They 're different . " No nov-*C larence Bunsen : " Most Brethren I knew were death on card-playing , beerdrinking , and frowned on hand-holding , and of course they would n't go near a dance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , maybe theirs laycloser to the surface , I do n't know . Some were not only opposed to dancing but also felt that marching in formation was wrong , so we called them the Left-Footed Brethren . Some others were more liberal , Mr. Bell for example , he thought cards were okay so long as you did n't play with a full deck . The Bijou used to show good movies but the Brethren and some Lutherans ganged up on Art and made him stop , so now you have to drive to St. Cloud if you want to see unmarried people together in one room with the door closed . It 's a shame . I think if the church put in half the time on covetousness that it does on lust , this would be a better world for all of us .

" How about Beethoven ? " I asked , having heard something of his in school . " That depends , " she said . " Was he a Christian ? " I was n't sure . I doubted he was . On the long Sunday-night drive home , leaning forward from the back seat , I pressed them on inconsistencies like a little prosecutor : if dancing leads to carnal desire , how about holding hands ? Is it wrong to put your arm around a girl ? People gamble on football : is football wrong ? Can you say " darn " ? What if your teacher told you to read a novel ? Or a short story ?

" And wait until a Ford comes along . " All Brethrendrove Fords . In Lake Wobegon , car ownership is a matter of faith . Lutherans drive Fords , bought from Bunsen Motors , the Lutheran car dealer , and Catholics drive Chevies from Main Garage , owned by the Kruegers , except for Hjalmar Ingqvist , who has a Lincoln . Years ago , John Tollerud was tempted by Chevyship until ( then ) Pastor Tommerdahl took John aside after church and told him it was his ( Pastor Tommerdahl 's ) responsibility to point out that Fords get better gas mileage and have a better trade-in value . And he knew for a fact that the Kruegers spent a share of the Chevy profits to purchase Asian babies and make them Catholics . So John got a new Ford Falcon . It turned out to be a dud . The transmission went out after ten thousand miles and the car tended to pull to the left . In a town where car ownership is by faith , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and John figured there must be a good reason for his car trouble , which perhaps he would understand more fully someday . The Brethren , being Protestant , also drove Fords , of course , but we distinguished ourselves from Lutherans by carrying small steel Scriptureplates bolted to the top of our license plates . The verses were112PROTESTANTwritten in tiny glass beads so they showed up well at night . We ordered these from the Grace &; Truth Scripture Depot in Erie , Pennsylvania , and the favorites were " The wages of sin is death . Rom.6:23 " and " I am the way , the truth and the life . Jn.io:6 . " The verse from John was made of white beads , the Romans of lurid red , and if your car came up behind a Brethren car on the road at night , that rear verse jumped right out at you . It certainly jumped out at me the night I drove Karen Mueller back from Avon , where we had had two whiskey sours apiece on her fake ID . I was going seventy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hill and there was a pair of taillights and what looked like a red stripe between them . I hit the brakes , we skidded at an angle so that for one split second , looking out the side window , I saw " The wages of sin is death " like a flashbulb exploding in my face , and then we were halfway in the ditch . I hit the gas , and we passed Brother Louie on the low side , and I got Karen home before eleven , and nobody was the wiser except me . " You 're a wonderful driver . You saved our lives , " Karen said , but I knew the truth . Drinking whiskey sours with a Catholic girl and thinking lustful thoughts , I had earned death three times over , and God was reminding me of this at the same time as He took the wheel for those few seconds , probably because He had a purpose for Brother Louie 's life . Perhaps God had a purpose for mine , too , but He must have wondered why I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My own purpose was escape , first in my dad 's car ( a Ford Fairlane station wagon ) and then in the car he gave me ( a 1956 Tudor sedan ) . Both of these cars had verses bolted to the plates , so I carried pliers with me and pulled over just outside town and removed the evidence of our faith and put it in the trunk . Then I raced off and did what I could to debauch myself , and , on the way back , sometimes reeling from the effects of a couple Grain Belts and half a pack of Pall Malls , I bolted the verses back on . The Grace &; Truth catalog offered many items with Scripture emblazoned on them , including birthday cards ( " Ye must be born again " ) , a Gospel mailbox with handsome nameplate and " My Word shall not pass away . Matt.24:35 " painted on the lid , a telephone-book cover ( " Let no corrupt communication pass out of your mouth , but that which is good to the use of edifying . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LAKE WOBEGON DAYSye are no more strangers and foreigners , but fellow-citizens with the saints , and of the household of God .

There were paper napkins and placemats in the Bible Families , Familiar Parables , Our Lord 's Miracles , and Bible Prophecies series  --  once , my friend Lance came to supper and found Armageddon and the Seven-Headed Beast under his plate . Grace &; Truth even offered matchbooks . If a smoker asked for a light , you could give him the book ( " Your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost , therefore glorify God in your body , which is God 's " ) .

Thus , the need to place Scripture in plain view . A fellow motorist 's heart might be opened on the road ; our license-plate verse would be right there at the right moment to show the way . I felt that so much Scripture floating around might tend to harden some hearts , that Scripture should be treated with reverence and not pasted to any flat surface you could find  --  at least , that was what I said when Brethren asked why I did n't carry a " The Peace of God Passeth All Understanding " bookbag to school . In fact , I was afraid I would be laughed off the face of the earth . My dad 's car sported a compass on the dashboard , with " I am the Way " inscribed in luminescent letters across its face , clearly visible in the dark to a girl who might be sitting beside me . " Why do you have that ? " she might say . " It 's not mine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say . " I do n't know why , I guess he likes it there . " I wanted her and me to be friends and our conversation to head in the direction of personal feelings , The Importance of Being Free and Sharing Love , and not toward the thorny subject of obedience , which tended to put a damper on things . The compass was n't easily removed ; you 'd have to get behind the instrument panel to remove the nuts . I thought of covering it with masking tape , but that might only draw attention to it . So I hung my cap on it . Brother Louie was n't so timid . His car ( a Fairlane four-door ) was114PROTESTANTa rolling display of Scripture truth , equipped not only with verses on the license plates but also across the dashboard , both sunvisors , the back of the front seat , all four armrests , the rubber floormats , the ashtray and glove compartment , and just in case you were n't paying attention , he had painted a verse across the bottom of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full of the goodness of the Lord "  --  for your edification as you gazed at the scenery . Brother Louie kept a plastic bucket by his left leg , where he kept Gospel tracts , rolled up and wrapped in bright cellophane , which he tossed out at mailboxes as he drove along . The cellophane was to protect the Word from rain and also to attract the eye . And finally , one year , he found a company in Indiana that advertised custom-made musical horns . Louie 's horn played the first eight notes of the Doxology . It sounded like a trumpet . He blew it at pedestrians , oncoming traffic , while passing , and sometimesjust for his own pleasure . On occasion , vexed by a fellow driver , he gave in to wrath and leaned on the horn , only to hear " Praise God from Whom all blessings flow " . It calmed him down right away . The horn cost Louie more than a hundred dollars , and when he traded in the Fairlane on a Galaxie , he took the horn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ingqvist State Bank , which entitled him to a cubicle , three feet of oak paneling topped with two feet of frosted glass . He sat in there and received loan applicants , the small-time ones , and also some depositors . Many older people who remembered their elders ' memories of the failure of the New Albion Bank in the Panic of 1873 did not quite trust a bank per se and were uneasy about shoving their money under the grill to Mary Dahl , who was nineteen years old and chewed gum . They wanted Louie to accept it personally . It was touching to see Mrs. Fjelde and Mrs. Ruud and Mrs. Diener , old farm ladies in farm-lady dresses and their best black hats with the veils , their cotton stockings and old cloth coats , shuffling into Louie 's cubicle . Sitting by his desk , enjoying the little ritual conversation . " Good morning . You certainly look well . " " Thank you , Louie . Actually , my back has been bothering me . " " I 'm sorry to hear that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel better when it warms up . " Some weather talk . " How 's Lena doing ? And Harold ? What do you hear from Elsie ? " Louie knew everybody by name . Some news , and then the grandi1cLAKE WOBEGON DAYS PROTESTANT moment : reaching in her purse for the coin purse , emptying the egg money out on the desk . A few crumpled ones , a lot of quarters and dimes . Louie , impressed : " Well , look at that ! Doing pretty well , I 'd say . " The careful count of the treasure . Filling out the deposit slip . The customer inquiring about Louie 's wife , Gladys , and his four daughters . Some customers could make a fifteen-minute transaction out of less than five bucks . At the end , Louie stood up and held out his hand . " Thanks , " he said . " Appreciate your coming in . " And out they went . Brother Louie , a heavy-set young man with a full head of black hair and elegant mustache who had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grew old and fat and bald at the bank , where he stayed assistant cashier for thirty years until he retired in 1961 , after forty-five years of employment there . It never occurred to me until he retired that once Louie had wanted to make something of himself in the banking business . In the flush of pride that accompanied retirement  --  his picture appeared on the front page of the Herald Star along with an extensive article , " Town Lauds Louie For Years of Service , " and a photo of a Certificate of Distinguished Citizenship that Hjalmar , using his consid- erable influence , had wangled for Louie from Governor Elmer L. Andersen himself , signed by him and by Minnesota 's Secretary of State Joseph L. Donovan , and presented to Louie at a banquet at the Sons of Knute temple , attended by everyone , even Fr . Emil  --  Louie went so far as to show me his scrapbook and talk about his salad days , which was utterly unlike him : on Louie 's Grace &; Truth shaving mirror was , " Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and he lived by that precept . I never knew a man who tried so hard to avoid the personal pronoun . In the scrapbook , along with photos of his parents ( who glared at the photographer as if this moment was a terrible insult , even though they had paid for it ) and of him and Gladys in the front seat of a Buick roadster ( his only non-Ford car ) and souvenirs of a honeymoon in the Black Hills , was a certificate from the St. Paul College of Commerce proclaiming in fancy script bedecked with patriotic bunting that Louie had successfully completed a course in finance and banking and earned the degree of Associate of Commerce . It was dated 1931 . He earned the degree studying at night , and when it came in the mail , he said , " I told Gladys we were moving to the Cities . It was our chance . " " We packed everything we owned in the back of the Buick and took off a week later . Sandy and Marylee stayed with their grandma . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was on the other side of the world , where there were missionaries . We had a flat this side of St. Cloud and another near Anoka and then one in Osseo . Gladys thought I could 've checked those tires before we left , which I had , but I was too mad to talk about it , so we hauled in around midnight at the Cran Hotel on Hennepin Avenue , which looked to have reasonable rates in the tourist guide , and got a room . The lobby was dirty , and there were old men sitting around the lobby in their undershirts , and the desk clerk was rude . He said , Whaddaya want ? ' Gladys would n't let me pick up the change . She said , You do n't know where that money has been . ' The room was small and it smelled of disinfectant . I opened the closet and almost fell to my death  --  no floor , it was a shaft of some sort , it went down to the basement ; I dropped my shirt in it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wide awake . Gladys said , Someone died in here , that 's why the Pine-Sol . I 'm not about to get into a deathbed . ' She said she would prefer to sleep on a park bench . So we got dressed and snuck down the backstairs to avoid notice . We drove to the Hotel Nicollet . It was a swank place with walnut paneling and potted palms and a carpet like walking in mud . Well , we must 've looked like orphans in the storm because the clerk asked if we had reservations and then he got snooty with us , he said , Ordinarily we 're full weeks in advance . You really should have written on ahead a long time ago . But you 're lucky , I do have a room for $15 . ' Gladys thought it was the weekly rate . She said , No , we 're only staying the one night . ' But I knew . I looked him straight in the eye and I said , You would n't happen to have something better , would you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were green . No , he said , so I said we 'd take it and I peeled off a twenty , my only one . Gladys was in shock , and so was I. We got to the room which was like a royal suite , and we could n't sleep for thinking about all that money . Fifteen dollars ! Gladys said , What made you say that ? ' Well , it was pride talking , worldly pride . I was so ashamed . I thought of the girls , the things I could 've done for them with that money . I sat up all night thinking . I decided that if Min-116 n7LAKE WOBEGON DAYS PROTESTANTneapolis had that effect on me , that I 'd rather spend what I did n't have than admit to not having it , then I 'd better go back where I belonged , and the next day we did . And then I told a lie : I said I 'd looked for a job and did n't find one good enough . It took me a long time to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not hold with ambition of worldly success , and their hopes for their children were modest ones : to earn an honest living , take pleasure in the Lord , and suffer trouble cheerfully . College was not necessary , nor was a well-paying job . Mr. Milburn of the St. Cloud Brethren earned a good dollar as a wholesale hardware salesman for Benson Brothers , but salesmanship forced a man to put his faith on the shelf  --  if a client cursed and told dirty jokes , he 'd have to bite his tongue . Farming was the most godly livelihood , and show business was the least . When Bernie Carlson ( " Mister Midwest " ) , host of the popular " Happy Day " and " Farm Hour " shows , got fired for a drunken remark to the Sweetheart of Song , it was noted as " what happens to people who get too big , " the logical consequence of success . Bernie was " big " in nobody 's eyes but ours . WFPT in Freeport was a Quonset hut in a cornfield by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and was on the radio , so he was pointed out to me as a sign of " what happens . " I was ten and I liked to read from the newspaper into a cardboard tube , cupping a hand behind my ear to hear if I had Bernie 's deep bass tones . On Memorial Day , two great bands of marchers assemble in the morning , the Catholics at Our Lady and everyone else at the Luth- eran church , and the Catholics are definitely the flashier outfit . Twelve Knights of Columbus led by Florian Krebsbach will lead them in their smart black suits and satiny capes with silver sabers at their sides and gorgeous white plumes on their black tricorn hats , followed by Father Emil in gold-embroidered surplice , and the five Sisters leading the classes from Our Lady School , including the fluta- phone band in red capes , tooting " Immaculate Mother . " We pass Our Lady on the way to the Lutheran church , and the Catholics are a wonder to behold . Florian , a mechanic by trade , now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fleet ; gold and silver medals adorn his chest as he stands with the other Knights , smoking a last Lucky , and gives a nod to us poor Protestants slouching by . The Catholic boys ' drum and bugle corps wears purple sashes with white fringe , the boys ' honor guard carries a dozen flags including six American ( five large , one immense ) , the Order of St. Benedict , the Marian Society , the St. Joseph 's Circle , and the long green banner of the Little Sisters of St. Margaret , and six white carbines for the rifle salute . They could add two senators and an elephant and it would n't be any more magnificent than it is . The municipal Lutheran procession is nothing but a bugler , two flags , the Sons of Knute , and a big crowd . " Christians do n't go in for show , " my father says , explaining the difference . We are n't Lutheran , but there are only two parades to choose from ; if we Brethren put on our own , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Christ commanded us to be humble , " he adds . Well , I guess we 've got that commandment in our hip pockets . We 're humble to the point of being ridiculous . We look like POWs . We march first , and the Catholics march after us . We walk up the hill to the cemetery behind Gary and LeRoy in the cruiser , the bubblelight flashing , and the poor old Knutes wobble along and everyone else brings up the rear , and as we turn the corner onto Taft , we hear the clatter of drums and a burst of flutaphone toots and Florian hupping the Knights , and I turn to see the Catholics swing out onto Taft and head for our rear . Our numbers are approximately equal , but if they attacked , they would roust us in a minute . I 've read Foxx 's Book of Martyrs , and it 's hard to forget : scenes of faithful Huguenot believers praying quietly and praising God and forgiving the hordes of Catholics who pile kindling at their feet . If the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pile dry brush around me and call on me to renounce my faith while a Catholic Boy Scout prepares his flints , what would I do then ? I guess I 'd renounce , all right . Kiss a statue , hold a crucifix , do what they said . I could always cross my fingers at the time and prevent a real conversion . God would know I did n't mean it . Our Prairie Home Cemetery is divided into Catholic and Us ; they have their gate and we have ours , and a low iron fence with spikesLAKE WOBEGON DAYSseparates the two . After service , while our elders stroll among the stones , we boys practice jumping the fence . Little kids stand by and watch this , lost in admiration . You make your first jump when you 're nine or ten and the fence comes up to your thighs , an awesome feat because if you missed , of course , you 'd fall on the spikes and be impaled and die there . Nobody could save you . You 'd flop around like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you clear the fence , then you have to jump right back over or else . " You ca n't come here , " David Krueger told me . He was Catholic . He had a heinie and a fat face and was " after " me at school . He got me . " This is holy . Get the hell out . " I broke away from him and vaulted back to our side . Then he jumped over and we chased him back . Then we stood and exchangedviews . " Catholics stink . " " You stink so bad you think everybody does . You stink so bad , you make flowers stink . " " The Pope is dumb , he ca n't even speak English . " " You 're so dumb you 're going to hell and you do n't even know it . " " Am not . " " Am too . " That was afterward . First , our crowd gathered in silence on the slope above the obelisk erected in 1889 by the Grand Army of the Republic in grateful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for their country and conducted a formal service out of which , had they been watching , those brave men surely would have gotten a big kick . The ladies ' sextet , decked out in white dresses , gathered to one side of the obelisk along with ( then ) Mayor Hjalmar Ingqvist and Pastor Tommerdahl , and the schoolchildren 's committee to the other , under the eye of Miss Lewis . For once , we needed no shushing ; the presence of death hung heavy in the sweet summer air , as the killdeers called their name and the meadowlarks warbled and our relatives eased themselves down on the fresh grass , and the somber reality of the committee 's task weighed on us . All eight of us , chosen on the basis of good behavior , had memorizedthree pieces  --  the Gettysburg Address , " In Flanders Fields , " and the Twenty-third Psalm  --  but we did not know which child would be called on to recite until the moment for that piece arrived and Miss120PROTESTANTLewis put her hand on the victim 's shoulder . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the linesIn Flanders fields , the poppies blow Between the crosses , row on rowThat was easy , but then what ? Something about larks singing , which was stuck to " Four score and seven years ago " and " He maketh me to lie down , "  --  and when you tried to pull out the line about the larks , your hot little mind coughed up a wad of odds and ends , a whole bird 's nest of lines ( " Pepsi-Cola hits the spot , twelve full ounces , that 's a lot " ) , and you tried to catch Miss Lewis 's eye with a silent message : I ca n't do it . She looked straight ahead . The Sons of Knute honor guard stood at the gate smoking and fiddling with their rifles , waiting for the crowd to shut up , then they marched double-file up the drive , all eight of them . On the gravel , their shoes ground out a sort of beat for a few steps and then the curve and the incline threw them off stride @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dancing , trying to get back in step , until the Grand Oya yelled Halt . They turned to face us , and the sight of them did nothing for our confidence . They looked exhausted by the march . They wore the remnants of old Army clothes , whatever still fit them , and they made me think I 'd rather die young in battle than grow up to be a Knute . All in all , they were not the men you 'd pick to fire rifles around a crowd . Pastor Tommerdahl took two steps forward , bowed his head , and prayed . It was a long one , taking in a good deal of American history , and gave me time to worry about the Gettysburg Address , the first hurdle of the program . The awful moment arrived . Karen was tapped for the Address , stepped forward , and said it perfectly . The ladies ' sextet then offered " Abide With Me . " They got to use a hymnal , one more unfair advantage of being older . I pulled for them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one so bad that people would laugh out loud , and then they did  --  Mrs. Tollefson screeched like an old screen door  --  and I stifled a sudden laugh and it came out as a fart . Miss Lewis poked me , and I stepped forward , thinking it was time for " Flanders Fields , " and had to be yanked back. 121LAKE WOBEGON DAYSJohn Potvin was tapped for the poem , my classmate who we called " Wiener . " He stepped forward , got the first two lines out , stopped , and swayed in the breeze . " That mark our place , " Miss Lewis hissed between her teeth . He said that . " And in the sky ! " she hissed . He said that , and she gave him the line about larks , but his mind was shot and tlirt tie ducked and turned around and I saw the dark spot on the front of his pants .

The stairwell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , maybe , although through the window I could see roofs of stores on Main Street and the lake . That , I imagined , was the Atlantic Ocean .

She wore a gold crown encrusted with diamonds , a long white dress , a mink coat , golden slippers , and carried a jeweled scepter under her arm like a twirler 's baton . Behind her came ladies and a footman holding a radio on a cushion and an archbishop praying , and when she reached the landing below me , she looked up and gave me a dazzling smile . She climbed the stairs until she stood before me , I not daring to look up , staring at my black Keds .

" At ease , Captain , " said I. The band played " Minnesota , Hail To Thee . " I walked with a slight limp from my war wounds , carrying a softball bat  --  " You 're wounded , sir .

We of the school safety patrol got to wear Sam Browne belts and carry red " Stop " flags on poles ; at my post on the corner of Main and McKinley , I made little kids stand and wait until something big like a truck came along so I could stop it and march them across , but only little kids would wait ; the bigger ones just laughed and ran across the street . I was eleven . A bad age for a boy so starved for ceremony , because as I got good at it , other kids were losing interest . My older sister and her friends had gone in for weddings in the woods , dress-up affairs , and I 'd be usher one day and ringbearer another , then once got promoted to minister , stood on a stump , held a candle , and said " Dearly beloved " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they got interested in bike-riding with boys , which did n't include me . Little kids were n't much fun because I had to tell them everything to do , which is all right if you 're playing Army but not if you are King Vincent I of Altrusia ascending the throne in a royal-blue chenille robe  --  then the Altrusians are supposed to pay homage and lay precious gifts at your feet and make good bows and go down on bended knee and back away from the throne bowing , and it ruins the occasion if King Vincent has to tell them how to pay homage , they are supposed to just do it . I was extremely good at these events and could n't see why other kids were n't . You 'd go along in the ceremony  --  this time it 's Crazy Horse and the Sioux Chieftains in a council of war , asking the Great Spirit to bless them as they go after the cowboys  --  and everyone is doing a fairly good job of talking Indian and tossing the sacred dirt to the four winds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Let 's do something else .

Two of the Tollefsons and Karen Skoglund and I played office on the Skoglunds ' back porch ; they had two desks , two telephones , and good paper from Skoglund 's dimestore , receipts and bills and carbons , but they scribbled any old thing and expected you to believe it , then did n't bother to add up the numbers right . Karen was president , of course , which was fine , but when she got tired of office work and went in to watch television , she told us we had to stay . " You 've got to get out those shipments , " she said .

It was Jim 's idea  --  he had seen this on television and knew how it went  --  but I was a better Senator McCarthy than him , so he became a detective who helped the committeeand Sheldon , of course , was a Communist . He was good at it  --  we had him dead to rights , piles of proof that he spied and gave secrets to the Russians , most of the proof in writing ! and he sat there across the table with a gooseneck lamp aimed at him and lied his head off . Then he was Senator McCarthy and I was a Communist , a General John LaClaire who committed treason from the very heart of the Pentagon , a desperate criminal and atheist who sneered at the Committeeand then one day during hard questioning about his chummy correspondence with Stalin  --  the Committee had birthday cards in its possession  --  he leaped up and pulled a .45 automatic and was shot down dead by Senator McCarthy and sprawled across the table , his soul gone to hell . That day , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of August as detectives on the trail of three classmates whom we suspected of smoking cigarettes in the woods . We found a few butts near the old fort on Adams Hill and kept up surveillance for a day or two , then laid a trap . We left fresh cigarettes on a tree stump , cigarettes we had put cat hairs into , and observed our suspects for signs of nausea . We caught one , Paul , and made him confess . It was a good summer . Funerals , however , were my favorite . Funerals expressed my deepestfeelings at the time ; grief , of course , and the sadness of life , but also bravery and great dignity  --  funerals were dignified because we had a real corpse  --  our black spaniel , Cappy , and a series of cats , and a parakeet named Pete . Other people held funerals for paper dolls such as Hedy Lamarr , but we thought that was childish . We had the real goods . Our funerals were based on the funeral of Aunt May , who died @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose funeral was the first our parents let us attend . I was seven . My mother did n't think I should go because it might be " too much " for me , and the words " too much " rang out in my ear : too much ? I had had far too little , I thought that too much would be just about enough . She and Dad discussed it quietly on the126PROTESTANTfront porch one Sunday afternoon while I wiped dishes . I liked to walk around while I wiped and , taking a pass by the open door , heard my name spoken in Dad 's low voice and stopped and knelt by the window . He was saying I had reached the age of accountability and the funeral might turn my mind toward eternal things . " Well , " she said , " I do n't know , " and I knew I was going to get to go . My mind had been on eternal things for a while , at least on death , the door to eternity . I knew that dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I often wondered what they did there , in the dark with no food , no radio , no books . Grownups did have , I knew , an ability to sit still for a long time , but death seemed like quite a feat even for them , even knowing that the Lord would come and get them and they would fly up to heaven . Aunt May lay in Lundberg 's Funeral Home , which was also the Lundbergs ' home . They lived on the second floor and in back . Mary Ellen Lundberg was eleven and was in my sister 's class . She and her sister Leila sang at funerals , including Aunt May 's , their blond hair in curls and their white dresses ironed and black shoes shined , " Asleep in Jesus , blessed sleep " and " Called From Above . " Mary Ellen said that dead bodies are cold and hard , the blood is all drained out of them , and sometimes they sit up in the coffin . But Aunt May did n't look like she was going anywhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It 's like being asleep , " he whispered , but to me she looked no more asleep than a piece of lumber . She looked dead as a doornail . We sat in back of the long room filled with black folding chairs , so still you could hear the old ladies fanning themselves . Dry coughs and solemn whispers , and faint odor of flowers and mothballs . Men in their blue Sunday suits . They walked softly , hardly letting their feet touch the floor . When Mr. Lundberg shut the lid on Aunt May , he did it as if she was made of spun glass and might shatter . Mrs. Lundberg played the organ softly , pumping the pedals , the bellows wheezing , and then Mary Ellen and Leila ( Leila who punched me in the stomach once ) sang in tiny voices , " Abide with me , fast falls the eventide . " And Uncle Al got up to read about the corruptible putting on incorruption in a voice I never heard before , not like his voice at all but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imagined my own self dead and lying in a coffin , this solemn127LAKE WOBEGON DAYS PROTESTANTcrowd gathered here in honor of me , and me a little ghost sitting by my big dad , enjoying the elaborate delicacy and gentleness of my funeral . Standing outside waiting to ride up to the cemetery and then at the cemetery and later at Flo 's house , people who never said boo to me before did now and put a hand on my head , petted me like a cat . May 's brother Roy , an old man who once yelled at me for coming in his yard to get a baseball , put his old hand on my head as he talked to Dad , and scratched my hair and kneaded my neck muscles . " You got a good boy here , " he said . Ordinarily , men like Roy were n't sweet like that , but sweetness was all over that funeral , even Leila was sweet . She said , " You should come and play in our yard sometime , we got a swing , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I was n't , I was enjoying every minute of it . Our funerals did not quite achieve the Aunt May standard , hard as we tried . For one thing , Mother made us do it right away when the dead body was found , no time to plan things properly , we had to get busy and dig a hole . For another , our funerals attracted a few who laughed out loud during the service , and when we told them to beat it , they said , " It 's just a dumb old cat ! " We could 've killed them . Especially the Krebsbachs , who sang off-key on purpose and when we put the box in the hole , they sang under their breaths , " The worms crawl in , the worms crawl out , the worms play pinochle on your snout . " But we did our best . Our cat Pinky was hit by a car . My sister found him in the road by the ballpark . She ran home , crying her head off , and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She did n't want to look . I put the white doily from the dining room table over him ( knowing I 'd get it later , but it was right that Pinky should have a nice piece of cloth ) and lifted him into the wagon , and we went home and I got a shoebox and started digging by the lilacs and she went around to invite the guests . We got five Little Flock hymnals out of the piano bench and picked out two songs . We set up folding chairs by the grave . The funeral was at three o'clock . Then the sad task of laying Pinky in the shoeboxandthen he did n't fit because his legs were stiff , so we got a hatbox and dug a bigger hole . We put him in the shade , the doily wrapped around his little orange body except for his face . Donna Bunsen arrivedand Janet and Judy Peterson and Jim and Marlys Mueller and12NMargaret Nute . They said they were sorry and shook our hands and then we got started . " Let us sing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Abide with me " and I stood up and read about the corruptible in a voice like Uncle Al 's . We sang " Away in a tent where the gypsy boy lay , dying alone at the close of the day , " and then I could n't think of how to pray , so we had a silent prayer . I closed my eyes and thought about our cat , how I had fed him that morning not knowing it was his last breakfast , how glad I was that I had stolen half a can of tuna for him ( though I was sure to get it for that , too ) , and how I would never see him again ever . I thought of him in heaven , chasing birds , where it is always warm and sunny and there are no cars . I thought about us children : would one of us eat breakfast one morning and then go out and be hit by a car ? Yes , I was sure it would happen , and right then my tears started flowing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then a crab apple flew in and bounced a few feet from Pinky . It was Casper Krebsbach , firing from the side of the garage , crouched behind the garbage can . " Casper , you creep ! " my sister yelled . Marlys said , " Do n't pay any attention to him . That 's what he wants . Ignore him . " But it was hard to ignore hard green crab apples lobbing in , and finally my sister made a dash for him . She caught him by the shirt and swung him around and threw him down and pounded him twice , hard , on his back , before he got away . Then we stood around the hole , put the cover over Pinky , set the box in the hole , and knelt , gently pushing handfuls of dirt over him . We patted the dirt into a mound and laid a half-slab of sidewalk on it , and wrote , in orange crayon , " P INKY our cat 1950 A.D. We love you . R.I.P . " and went in and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat in a circle and conversed as people do after funerals . " How is your mother ? " I asked Marlys . " She is very fine , thank you , " she said . " Is your family planning a vacation this summer ? " " Yes , we plan to visit the Black Hills in August , Lord willing . " " Lord willing " was a phrase learned in church , denoting the uncertainty of the future . It seemed appropriateafter burying a cat. /29SUMMERSUMMERIn winter , we sit in the house Around a blazing fire . In summer , we sit on the porch Like birds on a telephone wire . Society of summer evenings in Lake Wobegon was formal and genteel . We did n't bolt our food and jump up from the table but waited for the slowest eater , me , who hated all vegetables except pickles , and cleared the table , and two of us did dishes , a race between washer and wiper . By then , it was six o'clock . Children of age could go out bike-riding , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dad worked in the yard , except Wednesday , which was prayer meeting , and then sat on the porch , and one by one we joined them . The porch is about thirty feet long , almost the width of the house , and six feet , eight inches wide . The porch is enclosed with ten-foot-tall screens and we sit in old brown wicker chairs , rocker , couch , except me . I lie on the floor , feet to the house , and measure myself against that wonderful height . A six-eight person can pretty much write his own ticket. do " They say we 're supposed to get some rain , " Ralph said , stopping by our porch , * " but then they 've been saying that for a week . " The grass is brown , and you can taste dust in your mouth . A cloud of dust boils up behind Mel 's car when he comes with the mail , and then he does n't stop at the mailbox . Not even a shopper today or the phonebill ( Who called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think this is , the Ritz Hotel ? ) . Not even a free pamphlet from Congressman Zwickey 's office , something from the U.S.D.A. about keeping cool . The dog days of August , they 're called , but you get them in July , too , days when dogs camp under the porch where the dirt is cool and damp or lie panting in the shade , big grins on their faces . Good old Buster . Phyllis and I trimmed him one afternoon and kept trimming until we got him trimmed all even , he was clipped down to the stubble . A dog heinie . He seemed grateful . We ran the hose on him and he lay in the sun and got a dog tan . Nobody in this family lies in the sun . You work in the sun , you lie in the shade . We do n't have air-conditioning , of course . " If you 'd work up a little sweat out there , the shade ought to feel good enoughPorch society is described by Gaylord Gibbon in his Etiquette Along the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in our house but it applied to us anyway : The backyard is for privacy . Only people walking in the alley willbother you , and they 're the sort who would anyway . The porch is sociable , but certain rules apply :  --  Even if you 're screened from public view , it 's polite to call out hello to passers-by you know . It 's up to them to stop or not . It 's up to you to invite them in or not . The porch is a room of your house , not part of the yard . Only peddlers or certain ministers would barge right in.  --  If you say , " Why do n't you come up and sit for a bit ? , " it is customary for them to decline politely . If the invite was legit , it should then be repeated.  --  An invite to the porch is not an invite to the house . Its terms are limited to a brief visit on the porch , no refreshments necessarily provided unless the occupants have such at hand.  --  When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well  --  , " the visitor should need no further signal that the visit has ended . Only an oaf would remain longer . If the host says , " You do n't have to run , do you ? , " this is not a question but a pleasantry . Humankind knows no finer amenity than the screened porch . It is the131 LAKE WOBEGON DAYSfor you , " is Dad 's thinking . Air-conditioning is for the weak and indolent . This is n't the Ritz , you know . Be thankful for a little breeze . It was luxuries like A/C that brought down the Roman Empire . With A/C , their windows were shut , they could n't hear the barbarians coming . Decadence : we 're on the verge of it , one wrong move and k-shoom ! the fat man sits on your teeter-totter . You get A/C and the next day Mom leaves the house in a skin-tight dress , holding a cigarette and a glass of gin , walking an ocelot on a leash. *What about the Ingqvists , they have air-conditioning . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Emil ? He has hay fever . Father 's hay fever was so bad last summer , he could hardly breathe . His face was puffy , he went around with a hanky in his hand . He went to the North Shore for some relief in August , but one week alone with all that scenery was all he could bear . So he 's got an immense NorthernAire in his bedroom window and he lives up there . It was when Mrs. Hoglund got one that people talked . There was nothing wrong with her , so who did she think she was ? She said she got it for Janice who broke out in heat rash , but Janice only visited fortemple of family life , and the sacred preserve of the luxurious custom known as " visiting . " Compare it to the barbarity of the " business lunch , " the hideous conversational burden of the cocktail party , and the prison that is the formal dinner , the porch visit shines with civility .

Then they find a church where God is the gentle mist rising from the meadow and the smile on a child 's face . They do n't want to get sweaty anymore if they can help it . Some people dive right into decadence and make up for lost time , such as Wendell Tollerud who became a big noise in life insurance , has two cars ( automatic with A/C ) , a one-acre ranch house ( A/C , all the conveniences ) , membership in the Presbyterian church , and bought a lake home to get away in , which , he found to his horror , had no indoor plumbing . It was in virgin wilderness up north where septic tanks are forbidden . He paid the price of the cabin for a stainless-steel Swedish catalytic toilet ( indoor ) that convertsshit to a fine white ash like powdered sugar . Wendell had had eighteen years132SUMMERa week or two and always in June . " Well , it was probably a mistake , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have it , I might as well get the use of it . " So we 'd sit on our porch on an August evening , quietly perspiring , and hear her machine humming next door . If only there were a way to connect air-conditioning to health or education . An article in the Digest : " Air-Conditioning : Man 's New Weapon AgainstMalaria . " COMFORTABLE CHILDREN SCORE HIGH IN SCHOOL , STUDIES SHOW  --  KEEPING COOL ALSO CUTS CASES OF POLIO , SAYS DR . But schoolis out , and Mother thinks air-conditioning causes colds . When I remarkon the heat , she simply says , " Make the best of it . Life is what you make it . " Her answer to any complaint without specific symptoms . " Life is what you make it . " I feel that the saying " Life is what you make it " points directly toward air-conditioning . Mrs. Hoglund is making the best of it , obviously . She is sitting and enjoying a fine program on television ( which we do n't have either ) and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having an air conditioner and see if we like it , and if we do n't , we can send it back . " I sit , all hot and bothered , suffering , and mention this . Mother says , " Go outside . Do something . Take your mind off it . " But outside is not the answer . I want to be inside with cold air blowing at me . I 've been outside in the garden working . The rule around here is that you finish your work first before you take off and play , which means that I waste the cool of the morning slaving over vegetables I do n't like , and when I 'm finally free to take off , it 's too hot to do much . I get my golf club , a mashie niblick , out of the garage and play an imaginary game I invented , called Championship Golf : wherever I hit the ball , wherever it stops , that 's where the hole is . I 'm the champion , but it 's boring to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under a tree with two other kids , talking about what we would do if we had a million dollars . I would buy a large cool house with a swimming pool and hire some servants . Bringingme glasses of cold nectar is what they would do , and cranking up the air conditioner . Despite the heat and no rain , gardens come on like gangbusters , faster than we can haul in the stuff and give it away . Ralph sells noof outdoor billies and they held no further attraction . He wanted one you could sit in and not be reminded of all the people who 've been there before you. 133LAKE WOBEGON DAYS SUMMERproduce in July and August , not an ounce . Cans of Libby 's tomatoes gather dust on his shelves . Tomatoes are free for the asking , sacks of tomatoes are thrust on you after church . Nothing has changed in the garden since then . Slaving in her half-acre spread , August 1984 , Mrs. Luger does n't recall the garden fever that hit her and the Mister last winter* when months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and they careened through the catalog like submarine sailors on shore leave , grabbing everything in sight . By May 1 , twenty little tomato plants in sawed-off milk cartons had taken over the kitchen dinette . Two large boxes from Gurney 's cooled their heels on the chairs . Mr. Peterson and his Allis-Chalmers plowed the half-acre on his plowing route through town , and Mr. Luger worked it with a rake , busting up the big clods , making a flat brown table . May Day dawned warm and sunny , and the two veterans nod- ded at each other over morning coffee . It was V-Day . By July , Mr. and Mrs. started to feel they 'd set something in motion back there that was getting out of hand , and now , late July and August , the glacier is moving in on them for good . The pressure cooker has been running full blast for days , Ralph is out of Kerr lids , but vegeta- bles fill up the fridge , the kitchen counter  --  quarts of tomatoes have been canned , still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ razor in the morning , he picks up a cucumber .

Go to sleep , dream about watermelon vines reaching out and wrapping their spiny little fingers around your neck , the Big Berthas , the forty-pounders . Those canteloupe they planted , the Dauntless Dukes : why plant twelve hills ? why not two ? hen Bertha Ingqvist , David 's mother , said one April , " I do n't believe I'llput in a garden this year , " they knew she did n't have long .

But everyone else has some to give away . Back in April , she 'd have killed for a tomato . Not the imported store tomatoes that were strip-mined in Texas , but fresh garden tomatoes that taste like tomatoes . That 's how my mother felt , too , back then in my youth , so in May she set out thirty or forty tomato plants to satisfy our tomato lust and now , going into August , fresh tomatoes are no more rare or wonderful than rocks , each of us has eaten a bushel of them and there are plenty left where those came from . One night , she and I snuck over to the Tollefsons ' after their lights went out and left a half-bushel of tomatoes on their back step . On this morning in August when I am thirteen , it 's hot by ten o'clock . I poked along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then my mother sent me out to pick tomatoes . Rudy and Phyllis were already out there . I picked one and threw it at a crab apple tree . It made a good splat . The tree was full of little crab apples we 'd have to deal with eventually , and a few of them fell . My brother and sister stood up and looked : what did you do ? we 're gon na tell . I picked the biggest tomato I saw and took out a few more crab apples . Then I threw a tomato at my brother . He whipped one back at me . We ducked down by the vines , heaving tomatoes at each other . My sister , who was a good person , said , " You 're going to get it . " She bent over and kept on picking . What a target ! She was seventeen , a girl with big hips , and bending over , she looked like the side of a barn . I picked up a tomato so big it sat on the ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week . The underside was brown . Small white worms lived in it . It was very juicy . I had to handle it carefully to keep from spilling it on myself . I stood up and took aim , and went into the wind-up , when my mother at the kitchen window called my name in a sharp voice . I had to decide quickly . I decided . A rotten Big Boy hitting the target is a memorable sound . Like a fat man doing a bellyflop , and followed by a whoop and a yell from the tomatoee . She came after me faster than I knew she could run , and I took off for the house , but she grabbed my shirt and was about to brain me when Mother yelled " Phyllis ! " and my sister , who was a134 3SLAKE WOBEGON DAYS SUMMERgood person , obeyed and let go and burst into tears . I guess she knew that the pleasure of obedience is pretty thin compared to the pleasure of hearing a rotten tomato hit someone in the rear end. * " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but Mother just said that that was enough of that and to get back to work . That was fine with me . Later Phyllis caught me coming out of the bathroom and pinched me . In my baby picture , still displayed on the piano , she held me on her lap and looked down at me with pure devotion . I could n't help telling her how much her attitude had changed . I told her not to be so unhappy . " Life is what you make it , " I said . " You should get out and enjoy yourself more . " As I said it , I jumped back in the bathroom and locked the door . She pounded on it , then pretended to go downstairs , but I could tell fake footsteps and I stayed put . " I can hear you breathing , " I said . I stayed put for all of one Reader 's Digest and part of another . A door slammed downstairs . My mother called my name . I yelled for help . She came upstairs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I said . " Do n't be silly , " Mother said , " there 's nobody here but me . " O ne slow week years later , the Herald-Star carried a photo of the Lugers looking at their garden under the headline GARDENS DOING WELL , RESIDENTS SAY  --  SWEET CORN , TOMATOES , ON TARGET , ACCORDING TO REPORTS . I thought mytargeted tomato would have made a great photo , and also the cheeseburger I bought at the Chatterbox when I was four with a dollar I stole off the kitchen counter . My father arrived just as Dorothy put the beautiful cheeseburger in front of me ; he said , " You come with me , " and I said , " I 'll be there in a minute . " He dragged me away without a bite . No burger since has looked so good to me . I still miss it . Wake up nights hungry and see it . In Gene Autry and the Mystery of Big Mesa , a gang of desperados rode into town when Gene was away , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Dry Goods Store , grabbed one end of a bolt of calico and rode away with it up the street , trailing a long flag of bright blue cloth that got longer and longer . A bad man , and yet I could n't get that picture out of my head , and though I knew it was wrong to tie all those sheets together the day after washday and run out the front door and tow them around the house , whooping at my horse Bob , forty feet of white sheets is quite a sight . Throwing the tomato was a great moment . It was a fabulous cheeseburger . " Do n't you know it 's wrong to steal ? " he said . Of course , I knew . In the Bible , people who innovated tended to get smote , and that at a time when God smote hard : when He smited you stayed smitten , smiting was no slap on the wrist .

One day in early July , Irene saw that her tomato had championship potential , which in a town full of fierce competitors who 've seen some biggies was a tomato to get excited about , particularly for Irene , who was known for her black thumb because she had bad luck with marigolds . Everyone else 's would come up like a drill team and Irene 's got sick and drooped , and some women made cutting remarks such as , " Gee , you 're the first person I ever knew who had trouble with marigolds . Mine grow like weeds . " The contender tomato was situated high on the plant , which she had staked up , so she was worried it might lose its grip . She pounded in two more stakes and made a little hammock out of mosquito netting for the tomato to lie in . It weighed close to twenty ounces . Her sister Arlene grew a two-pounder once , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it did n't count . The record was twenty-four . Irene nursed it up to twenty-two . She was so proud of it , you'd 've thought she made it in her basement . You'd 've thought she invented tomatoes . She tore the other tomatoes off the plant on the theory they were taking nourishment away from the champ . She rigged a hanky to protect it from sunburn and one night she woke up in a storm and ran out to make sure it would n't blow down . Clint woke up when she left and looked out the window . He saw her in the flashes of lightning , kneeling by the tomato plant , holding onto the stakes . As it closed in on the record , she checked it twice a day for bugs and whatnot , and it was during a routine check that she bumped theboard on which she placed cloth figures and moved them around .
