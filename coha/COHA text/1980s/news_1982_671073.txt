Mr. Malle ' s terse summation leaves nothing out , and his hesitation is understandable . Why should a film in which a balding avant-garde playwright with a squeaky voice sits in a restaurant and listens for nearly two hours to a friend ' s droning account of his identity crisis be of interest to anyone but those fanatical moviegoers who haunt revival houses and the basement theater of the Museum of Modern Art on weekday afternoons ? Nothing else happens in " My Dinner With Andre . " What we see is a conversation between two people playing themselves : Andre Gregory as the avant-garde theatrical director Andre Gregory , and Wallace Shawn as the playwright Wallace Shawn . When " My Dinner With Andre " opened at the Lincoln Plaza Theater last October , attendance was so sparse after six weeks that it came within three days of closing . Yet five months later , the lines are long , both in New York and in theaters across the country ; it is scheduled to open in 50 new locations in the next few weeks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are suddenly movie stars. // The film ' s success is even more unlikely than its meager plot would suggest . Chewing and swallowing his quail with unseemly vigor , grains of rice dropping from his lips , his pink bald head glistening , his sly round face and monk ' s tonsure like an image out of Breughel , Mr. Shawn is hardly your usual box office draw . And Mr. Gregory , whose chronicle of his adventures in Tibet , Poland , the Sahara and other exotic lands dominates the film , is a notably unprepossessing figure given to long-winded monologues . Listening to his interminable account of a clairvoyant architect who was commissioned by a Scottish commune to design a meditation hall that would attract UFOs , one is tempted to head out to the lobby for popcorn. // Yet the film obviously does sustain our attention - as a drama if not as a documentary . " I ' d been working as a playwright for 10 years , " Mr. Shawn recalls in a preface to the published script . " My plays had been intense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generously shown on the stage my interior life as a raging beast , but my exterior life as a mediocre human being and dilettante of normal intelligence remained unchronicled . " While Mr. Gregory , never one to embrace the Zeitgeist half-heartedly , was off getting in touch with his feelings , Mr. Shawn found himself headed in the opposite direction : " Beneath my work ' s primeval , hysterical facade there was a calm little writer in an armchair just waiting to burst forth. " // How did this aspiration become a full-length feature film directed by Louis Malle ? " I directed Wally ' s first play , ' The Late Hour , ' " Mr. Gregory recalls , " and we ' d been looking for a new project to collaborate on . I thought we should go to Atlantic City , hole up in a hotel room and write a musical . " But Mr. Shawn had another idea : " Whatever I do has to be the most incredible thing ever , " he said the other day , recounting the events that led up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occurred to me that what I really wanted to do was make a film . I ' ve always been interested in the spiritual side of life , but it ' s hard to write about states of mind in the theater . " What Mr. Shawn proposed was to film a conversation with Mr. Gregory in which " he would say absurd things , I would say absurd things , and we would just talk , as people really do . " Over a period of three months , the collaborators sat down and talked into a tape recorder several times a week or two for five or six hours at a time . Mr. Shawn ended up with a transcript that ran to some 2 , 200 typed single-spaced pages . " Then I tried to figure out if it was about anything. " // After a year ' s work on the script , he showed it to Mr. Gregory , who showed it to a friend of Mr. Malle ' s , who showed it to the director . Mr. Malle read it overnight , thought it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direct the film if a backer could be found - not an easy matter , given the plot . After raising money for a year , Mr. Shawn and Mr. Gregory accepted an invitation from London ' s Royal Court Theater to produce the script as a play , and when Michael White , a prominent theatrical producer in the West End , saw the stage version , he put up the last $100 , 000. // Mr. Malle , who had been rehearsing the actors for six months , going over their performances on videotape like a football coach , shot the film in 16 days . " It was the hardest piece of directing I ' ve ever done . " It was December , and there was no heat on location , the ballroom of an old hotel in Richmond , Va. , that had just closed down . ( The posh restaurant in the film is a stage set . ) Every scene was shot over and over , out of sequence , in different moods , for 12 hours a day . " I got high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " By the end of the day I ' d be hyperventilating. " // " My Dinner With Andre " is fiction , Mr. Shawn stresses , even if it ' s based on truth . " Andre is giving a conscious performance as a self-involved , whimsical dilettante , and I ' m giving a conscious performance as a terribly obtuse and self-righteous bourgeois . " Mr. Gregory , too , declares the film a work of imagination , though he is less clear than Mr. Shawn about just what is made up . Asked how he differs from the character in the film , he lapses into an uncharacteristic silence . To meet him after having seen him on the screen is to meet someone who seems utterly familiar . Gracious , self-deprecatory , eager to please , he speaks in carefully rehearsed phrases that echo his preoccupations in the film : " What I was really trying to find out was ' Who am I ? ' " " I think the film ' s message is ' Be true to yourself . ' " And his preface @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same earnest philosophical tone ; " My Dinner With Andre , " he writes , is dedicated " to all , artists and otherwise , who are out on the road somewhere wandering , with no destination in sight. . . " // Of course , the character in the film is playing himself and rehearsing lines he spoke into a tape recorder describing events that actually happened , so it ' s hardly surprising that the fictional and the real Mr. Gregory bear a close resemblance . But the part Mr. Shawn devised for himself , however autobiographical in its particulars , is largely invented . In the film , he appears as a comically self-pitying figure , recounting the vicissitudes of his daily life in a voice-over as he wanders about his neighborhood in the opening scene . " We had to have some money coming in , " he says , lamenting his poverty . He is desperate for acting work ; the world is indifferent to his plays ; his girlfriend , Debbie , has to work as a waitress to support them . " The life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is hardly the obscure playwright he purports to be . " Marie and Bruce , " with Louise Lasser and Bob Balaban , received respectful reviews when it was produced Off Broadway two years ago , and " The Hotel Play , " a chaotic drama that had a brief run last summer , featured a cast of 80 people more or less known around town , from the writer Ann Beattie to the playwright Christopher Durang . In other words , this isn ' t some dishevelled scribbler we ' re observing on the screen , but a figure of some local reputation . ( The acknowledgments page of the published script constitutes a virtual encyclopedia of prominent names : Richard Avedon , Joseph Papp , E. L. Doctorow , and more than 40 more . ) In person , Mr. Shawn is thoroughly unpretentious , showing up for an appointment in a sweatshirt and battered workman ' s shoes , but far less naive and bumbling than in the film . He talks with great assurance about what he tried to do in the play : " This isn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' s a satire ; we ' re playing exaggerated versions of ourselves . " He couldn ' t have filmed them as they are even if he had wanted to , Mr. Shawn insists : " Real people are too complicated . Every person is so infinitely self-contradictory that he ' s incoherent . " The part he fashioned for himself in " My Dinner With Andre " is bizarre even for someone whose film roles have included a mad scientist in Marshall Brickman ' s " Simon " and the husband Diane Keaton deplores as a " wild animal " in Woody Allen ' s " Manhattan . " He is Boswell to Mr. Gregory ' s Johnson , sitting back and prompting him with an occasional " Tell me about it " or " What happened then ? " Cradling his head in the palm of his hand , as dumbly shrewd as a French peasant , he takes in Mr. Gregory ' s preposterous monologue with a buffoon ' s credulity , his only response a whinnying laugh or the sort of astonished " gosh " one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Empire State Building . For Mr. Gregory , glad to have an audience , these rudimentary expostulations are all the encouragement he needs to give an exhaustive account of his efforts to find himself . A well-known theatrical director whose innovative productions of " Endgame , " " Alice in Wonderland " and " The Seagull " made him an important force in experimental theater during the 1970 ' s , Mr. Gregory suddenly dropped out and embarked on a quest for spiritual salvation that took him all over the world . Invited by the Polish theater director Jerzy Grotowski to participate in a workshop in Poland one summer , he ended up singing and dancing night after night in a forest with a group of men and women who didn ' t speak a word of English ; in the company of a Japanese Buddhist priest , he set off on an expedition through the Sahara ; he explored India and Tibet , and visited Findhorn , a vegetarian commune in Scotland where " people sang and talked and meditated with plants . " Which character finally has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spectator to take Wally ' s point of view at the start , " says Mr. Malle . " He ' s supposed to think , ' What am I doing with this crazy guy ? ' But by the end Wally is even crazier than Andre . " And Mr. Shawn concurs : " I think Andre ' s right and I ' m wrong . I ' m supposed to be the dumb jerk trying to understand , like Flaky Foont ( in the R. Crumb comic strip ) - the one who goes around saying , ' Gee , Mr. Natural . . . ' " It is Mr. Gregory whose ideas ultimately prevail , he claims : " By the end , I ' m thinking about myself , about life , and taking Andre very seriously . That ' s the story of the film . " Yet somehow Mr. Gregory emerges as a self-indulgent , spoiled character in the film , while Mr. Shawn is made to seem a sensible fellow , l ' homme moyen sensuel , a lobbyist for the quotidian who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " of life . " Everybody knows that he ' s got some money hidden away somewhere , " the playwright muses as he waits at the bar of the expensive restaurant Mr. Gregory selected for their reunion . " I mean , how the hell else could he have been flying off to Asia or wherever he went and still have been supporting his family ? " And when the globe-trotting mystic shows up , his casual knitted sweater and aplomb at ordering confirm his moneyed leisure . Mr. Gregory is charming , elegant , well-spoken ; Mr. Shawn can ' t understand the waiter ' s French . " They ' re so little ! " he pipes when the quail arrive . Gradually , though , Mr. Shawn ' s cries of " incredible " and " wow " acquire a satirical edge ; his astonishment becomes a subtle critique of his companion ' s monologue . There is a willfulness in his naivete , an element of calculation ; after all , silence can be a weapon in itself , a form of hostility . The more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his farflung epiphanies seem . For all their exotic trappings , they could hardly be more conventional ; his adventures and revelations were the rites de passage of the time . " It seems to me quite possible that the 1960 ' s represented the last burst of the human being before he was extinguished , " he declares ; but it ' s Mr. Gregory who represents the last burst of the 60 ' s . The fascination with primal experiences and the unconscious ; the repudiation of our corrupt capitalist society in favor of the natural world ; the narcissistic preoccupation with one ' s own mind and body ; Mr. Gregory is a compendium of cliches from that decade and its aftermath . " The film would have been dull as cinema verite , " Mr. Malle observes . " The point was to pretend it was improvised . " Yet " My Dinner With Andre " could hardly be more artificial ; Mr. Gregory ' s monologues are implausibly long , and have a certain stilted quality that Mr. Malle claims is deliberate : " I wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Andre ' s speeches are the arias , and the waiter appears like an intermission between the acts . " Unfortunately , this contradiction is never quite reconciled ; Mr. Gregory rattles on about his mystical experiences for a while , then Mr. Shawn puts in with a few queer stories of his own . The most absorbing moments in the film are when the two characters confront each other , and these are few and far between . Still , despite the awkwardness of " My Dinner With Andre , " despite the stiffly posed scenes and monotonous conversation , there is something moving about these two weird characters . Mr. Gregory ' s confusion , his incessant cries of doubt , his anguish over the years he squandered in useless pursuits , his anxiety about nuclear war and the " savage , lawless , terrifying period " that may lie ahead : Even the most unyielding rationalist would find it hard to dismiss such a portrait of contemporary despair . And Mr. Shawn ' s homespun anecdotes serve as an antidote to Mr. Gregory ' s grim conjectures . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes on anyway , much as it always has . " I ' m just trying to survive , " he declares , and when Mr. Gregory challenges his dependence on his electric blanket with a speech about how alienated man is from nature , Mr. Shawn retorts : " It ' s a difficult environment . Our lives are tough enough as it is . I mean , I ' m not trying to get rid of the few things that provide relief and comfort . I ' m looking for more comfort , because the world is very abrasive . " This vehement defense of self-interest is a congenial theme for the 80 ' s , a decade when the last vestiges of social and political activism are fading fast . Yet Mr. Shawn is more than the smug bourgeois he pretends to be . He is in his own way a masterly storyteller , a cultural historian , a portraitist of urban life . His anecdotes about the hazards of social life in New York - how he was insulted at a party , how someone he considered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Recalling a performance of Bulgakov ' s " The Master and Margarita " in which he played the role of the cat and was subjected to a barrage of unconsciously malicious remarks about his costume , Mr. Shawn can only account for his colleagues ' hostility as an expression of some other , unrelated grievance : " Because somehow in our social existence we ' re only allowed to express our feelings weirdly and indirectly . " What a universal experience that is ! These little stories , more than any discussion of " issues , " are the real subject of " My Dinner With Andre . " The two actors talk and talk - and what they have to say often seems banal . Yet it is that very banality that so appeals to us . Confiding , perplexed , intermittently inspired , they sound very much like their audience . This is a movie ? one thinks . Then my own life must be interesting . And by shooting at such close range , Mr. Malle has managed to create the illusion that we are right there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intimate details of their lives : their feelings about their wives and girlfriends , their anxieties about their work , the circumstances of their daily lives . Few things are more engrossing to hear about then what really happened - or more reassuring . " Suppose you ' re going through some kind of hell in your own life , " Mr. Shawn speculates toward the end of his dinner with Andre . " You ' d love to know if your friends have <> experienced similar things . " " My Dinner With Andre " makes it clear that they have , for by the end of this movie the two men babbling over dinner seem like people we ' ve known for years. //
