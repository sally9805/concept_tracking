Sunrise was more than an hour off , and most of Managua was still asleep when the bombs exploded . " The earth moved , " recalled Sergio Cano , a laborer . " We thought the gringos had started bombing . " The blast in the Nicaraguan capital signaled neither an earthquake nor an armed invasion from the north but an unusually bold contra attack on an electrical tower . While residents slumbered in the dusty neighborhood of Domitila Lugo , rebels had scaled the high-voltage pylon and placed explosives on the metal crossbars . The explosion shattered windows and broke dishes in nearby homes , but no one was hurt . Indeed , electrical service was not even interrupted , and the tower remained standing . <P> Still , it was the first time in more than four years that the contras had struck at a target within the city limits . Muffed though it was , the attack delivered a warning that complemented the stepped-up rebel activity in the Nicaraguan countryside : the contras ' urban offensive seemed to have begun . Sandinista officials promptly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the daily party organ , Barricada : IT COULD HAVE BEEN A MASSACRE . In Washington , officials had quite a different reaction to the bungled strike . " They went all that way , got the charge wired in , then they screwed it up , " moaned an Administration official . " These guys are like the gang that could n't shoot straight . " <P> Two days later the U.S. Senate , by a vote of 52 to 48 , narrowly defeated an attempt to cut off the $40 million remaining of a $100 million aid package appropriated to the contras last year . " This is no Administration victory , " warned Majority Leader Robert Byrd . " This is an alarm bell . " Coming one week after an anti-contra House vote on the $40 million , the close Senate vote reaffirmed that Congress is in no mood to humor President Reagan by approving more money for the rebels . The Administration had been cautiously planning to stall until next fall on its request for $105 million in new contra aid . Last week , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well before then . The Administration plans to push for new appropriations before the summer recess . <P> At this point it is difficult to imagine a successful outcome for the Reagan Administration . The contras have yet to make an impressive military showing , have managed to pile up a dispiriting record of human rights abuses , and have earned a reputation for internal squabbling . Last week Congress found new cause for concern in reports that the CIA is providing the contras with detailed information on targets inside Nicaragua , including maps and blueprints of bridges , dams and other facilities built by U.S. agencies in the 1960s and 1970s . Legislators may find such involvement perilously close to the kind of CIA activities that led to a cutoff of congressional funds in 1984 , after U.S. agents mined a Nicaraguan harbor .
