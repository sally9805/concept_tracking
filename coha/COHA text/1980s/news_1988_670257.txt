NEW YORK  --  Federal Reserve officials probably will tighten their credit vise another notch very soon to counter growing inflation fears , many analysts predict . Several bankers expect the Fed to raise short-term interest rates this week in reaction to the economy ' s unexpected strength . But even if the Fed doesn ' t act that quickly , banks are likely to raise their prime lending rate soon . The prime , or base , rate " will go up very , very soon , perhaps this week " by half a percentage point to 9 1/2% , said Mickey D. Levy , chief economist at First Fidelity Bancorp . , Philadelphia . That would be the first increase since May 11 . Since then , banks ' borrowing costs have surged by about half a percentage point . Pressures for higher rates mounted after the Labor Department reported a surprisingly large drop in the nation ' s civilian unemployment rate last month to 5. 3% , the lowest in 14 years , from 5. 6% in May . The department also reported a strong 346 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tighten one more notch , " said Robert Giordano , partner and co-director of economic research at Goldman , Sachs &; Co . Clues to the Fed ' s policy plans may emerge Wednesday when its chairman , Alan Greenspan , presents its midyear economic and monetary report . He is scheduled to speak at a Senate Banking Committee hearing . The Fed " is likely to tighten simply because the economy is strong enough to produce inflationary pressures , " said Donald J. Fine , chief market analyst at Chase Manhattan Bank . The employment report Friday " was enough " to persuade the Fed to act , he said , adding : " The Fed ' s fear is if they wait too long , they will have more difficulty controlling inflation later . " Mr. Levy echoed this view , saying , " With the strength in the economy and potential inflation pressures , the worst thing ( Fed officials ) could do now is to do nothing . " In view of the latest economic figures , he said , Fed officials " are going to pull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' s most likely move will be to raise the federal funds rate slightly , rather than taking the bolder step of boosting the discount rate , many analysts agree . They say an increase in the discount rate  --  the fee the Fed charges on loans to banks and savings institutions  --  is unlikely in view of the dollar ' s recent strength , the Fed ' s desire to keep a low profile during a presidential election year and lingering concern about fragility of the financial markets . The federal funds rate , which is the rate on overnight loans between banks , averaged slightly more than 7 1/2% Friday . At the time of the previous prime-rate increase in May , the funds rate was averaging around 7% to 7 1/8% . Mr. Giordano of Goldman Sachs says the dollar ' s strength isn ' t sustainable . He cites the still-large U.S. trade and budget deficits , a U.S. inflation rate above that of several other major nations , and a possible narrowing of spreads between rates in the U.S. compared with other nations . The dollar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ May report on the U.S. trade balance . A smaller-than-expected April trade gap of $9. 89 billion , seasonally adjusted , helped set the stage for the dollar rally . Whatever the case , several bankers say they recently have discussed raising the prime rate . One New York banker says a prime-rate increase " clearly is justifiable " because of recent boosts in banks ' borrowing costs . But he says banks may wait until the Fed tightens credit further to reduce the chances of drawing criticism from customers and politicians . Richard B. Berner , vice president and economist at Salomon Brothers Inc. , said the question isn ' t whether the Fed will raise rates but rather " when and by how much . " He expects the Fed to further tighten credit " modestly . . . perhaps as soon as this week . " June employment " implies sufficiently strong income gains to fuel a moderate rebound in consumer spending on top of booming exports and capital spending , " Mr. Berner said . " In addition , the evident signs of labor-market tightness contained in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the coming months . " Despite the economy ' s robust performance lately , some analysts say the Fed isn ' t likely to tighten credit until clearer signs of higher inflation appear . Allen Sinai , chief economist at the Boston Co. , says the Fed will wait for June inflation numbers  --  the producer price index report to be released Friday and the consumer price to be released July 22  --  before tightening . He said some Fed policy makers might argue that mere strength in the economy without accompanying signs of increased inflation shouldn ' t prompt higher interest rates . Mr. Sinai said he expects a 0. 6% increase in the June producer price index and a 0. 5% rise in the consumer price index . " Unless the figures are overwhelmingly drought related , I expect those numbers to be enough to move the Fed " to a tighter stance , he said . " If the Fed wants to keep a lid on inflation , it will have to tighten more , " said Mr. Levy of First Fidelity . He said the continued surge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rate has not been enough to achieve the Fed ' s objective of dampening the fast pace of economic growth . " He expects a rise in the funds rate to 8% within a few weeks.  --  - Friday Market Activity Signs of stronger economic growth propelled most interest rates higher .
