LOST HONOR , By John Dean . Stratford Press ( distributed by Harper &; Row ) , 370 pp. , $15.95 . So Marlon Brando drove into John Dean ' s driveway in a jeep , and Dean noticed that Brando had put on some weight , and Brando noticed that Dean had noticed and explained that he had gained weight when he quit smoking , and Dean said , well , better to have quit smoking because Brando could always take off the weight later . This information comes from a man on whose every word the nation once hung as he sat before the Senate Watergate Committee , the camera occasionally switching to his wife Mo , supremely composed and beautiful , not an eyelash out of place . Dean ' s first book , " Blind Ambition , " was the story of his Watergate experiences . His second , " Lost Honor , " is a sort of What I Did While I Was Writing " Blind Ambition , " and , unfortunately , the segment about Marlon Brando is typical . He notes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is " the best in Beverly Hills . " The best beef stew in Beverly Hills ! I mean , like , gag me with a spoon ! Or he records for us the gibberish he wrote after his only experience with smoking marijuana . John Dean seems to be working an abandoned mine : There ' s some gold dust here and there and an occasional nugget , but the real ore has been hauled away . There ' s some truly scary stuff about Nixon ' s plans for the imperial presidency . Even a Nixon admirer told Dean that it sounded like the Soviet Politburo . Or Nixon ' s schemes to create tax breaks for himself after he left office . But it ' s mostly old news . Of course Dean dangles the question of who was Woodward and Bernstein ' s " Deep Throat " like a mystery writer dropping clues , and his final analysis of the question shows a good lawyer ' s mind at work , but the suspense is lostbecause news reports told us long ago that Dean ' s suspect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the image of John Dean , reporter , covering the 1976 presidential campaign for the Rolling Stone ( ! ) with British illustrator Ralph Steadman , who usually accompanies gonzo journalist Hunter Thompson.Hmmm , what if Dean had stuck with the marijuana . . . Dean doesn ' t seem to have learned the full lesson of the Watergate experience and still views the press with Nixon-like paranoia . And even if it ' s partly justified in his case , he engages in a wholesale condemnation of investigative reporting while clearly revealing that he doesn ' t understand what it ' s all about . Throughout the book there ' s a nagging feeling that if Benedict Arnold were alive today he ' d be out on the lecture circuit , and while Arnold ' s and Dean ' s crimes differ by vast degrees , such degrees also seem to be something Dean doesn ' t understand . At one point he marvels that a reformed burglar is welcomed as a hero on talk shows while there are protests over lectures by former Watergate conspirators such as himself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least should be , a difference between burglars and attorneys.
