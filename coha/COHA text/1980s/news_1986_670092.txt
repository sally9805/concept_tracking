NEW YORK  --  In the 1970s , when bankers began tripping over each other trying to lend money to corporations at rates that barely covered expenses , Morgan Guaranty Trust Co. ' s Antonio Gebauer was already a hero . Using a mix of wit , charm and an extensive network of personal contacts , he booked loans to public and private Brazilian clients at more than two percentage points over funding costs . But Mr. Gebauer will be remembered less for the money he made for Morgan than the scandal he caused it . Yesterday , about five months after an embarrassed Morgan acknowledged it was probing Mr. Gebauer ' s handling of certain Brazilian accounts , the 46-year-old Colombian-born ex-banker pleaded guilty in a federal court here to one count each of bank fraud and tax evasion , and two counts of creating false bank account statements . The revelations have caused great embarrassment to Morgan , which for years has maintained a reputation for assuring client privacy and having foolproof internal controls . They also raise questions about big U.S. banks ' role in enabling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violation of local rules , a practice known as capital flight . A Morgan spokesman said that " this episode is regrettable and unprecedented . As far as we ' re concerned it ' s concluded . " He added , " Our investigation convinces us that the responsibility for wrongdoing lies with one person and the proceedings today ( Thursday ) confirm that . We think it ' s unfair that other people be implicated . " Mr. Gebauer , who quit his job as a Morgan senior vice president in August 1985 to become an investment banker at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. , now faces a total of 20 years in prison and fines of as much as $360 , 000 . He owes the Internal Revenue Service $1. 7 million plus penalties and interest on unreported income of $3. 4 million . The penalties and interest should amount to at least another $1. 7 million , the U.S. attorney ' s office here estimated . Mr. Gebauer , who resigned from Drexel last spring , admitted that he defrauded Morgan of about $4. 3 million by issuing treasurer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ companies controlled by wealthy Brazilian customers , according to court papers filed by the U.S. attorney . Then , in an attempt to cover up at least some of the withdrawals , he arranged for the bank to lend the accounts about $2. 9 million , the court papers said . The documents said these transactions were carried out without the authorization or knowledge of Mr. Gebauer ' s clients . But it isn ' t clear how it escaped detection by Morgan officers and auditors for nearly 10 years . According to the documents , the transactions took place from early 1976 to Aug. 30 , 1985 , when Mr. Gebauer left the bank . That autumn , as a result of questions raised by a client about his account , Morgan launched an internal investigation of his activities . Howard Wilson , chief of the criminal division of the U.S. attorney ' s office here , declined to say to whom the checks were payable . But he said that the money was used by Mr. Gebauer for his own purposes . Mr. Gebauer declined to comment yesterday . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yesterday ' s proceedings , Mr. Wilson said in an interview that the investigation is continuing " to determine whether other people should be charged with crimes . " Six of the accounts were " hold mail " checking accounts , a type of account often set up by U.S. banks for wealthy foreigners who don ' t want statements mailed to them . According to the government , a total of seven accounts were held individually by a total of four Brazilians , who were identified by name . The government didn ' t characterize the accounts as illegal . Bankers who know Mr. Gebauer and the account holders say that the four Brazilians were close friends of Mr. Gebauer and trusted him to manage their money . Fernando Muniz de Souza is a wealthy landowner from Sao Paulo . Cecilio Almeida is a big construction company owner in the state of Parana ; his company financed some of its activities with Morgan loans , bankers say . Leonidas Borio is a member of a family formerly associated with a dealership for Caterpillar Inc. equipment . Francisco Catao is part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . None could be reached for comment . Bankers say Latin Americans often incorporate offshore companies to hold personal funds . The offshore entities sometimes help an individual avoid foreign exchange controls and income taxes in his home country . Bankers say such accounts in the U.S. aren ' t subject to income taxes here . In Brasilia , an official of Brazil ' s central bank said that it would investigate the four account holders . He said that Brazil is seeking to determine whether they were authorized by the central bank to maintain the accounts at Morgan and whether they evaded Brazilian income taxes . Mr. Gebauer used a variety of devices to carry out the scheme , according to court papers . The documents say he made false statements and entries in Morgan ' s books to deceive other bank officers . In addition , he used Morgan letterhead stationery to create false bank statements showing that one client had more money in his account than he actually did , court papers say . At one point , the false statements showed a balance of $11 , 819 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when it was actually overdrawn by $153 , 541 . According to the documents , Mr. Gebauer evaded federal income taxes from 1977 to 1983 . For example , in 1981 , the same year he was promoted to senior vice president in charge of Morgan ' s Latin American unit , Mr. Gebauer paid federal income taxes of $3 , 840 on reported taxable income of $21 , 284 , when in fact his taxable income was more than $1 million . Wearing a dark blue business suit and tortoise-shell glasses , Mr. Gebauer , short and stocky , somberly read a prepared confession to Judge Robert Sweet . Sentencing was scheduled for Dec. 11 , when government lawyers say they will disclose more details of Mr. Gebauer ' s activities . Meanwhile , Mr. Gebauer is free on a $2 million personal recognizance bond secured by his Manhattan cooperative apartment , which is said to be worth well in excess of that amount . A lawyer for Mr. Gebauer said his client had " no particular plans " to sell the co-op or his estate in East Hampton , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lavish parties for visiting Brazilian clients and bankers . Mr. Wilson of the U.S. attorney ' s office said Mr. Gebauer , a citizen of Venezuela , had turned over his passport to government authorities . Linda Imes , an assistant U.S. attorney on the case , told Judge Sweet that Mr. Gebauer has made " some restitution . " Credit : Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal
